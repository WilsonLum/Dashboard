Services at Ascender_**\n\nOrganisations are constantly dealing with change. Especially across Asia,\nconducting business can be a little more complicated sometimes, due to the\nrichness of and variety in cultural and social norms, economic systems,\nbusiness practices and governmental focus areas. Unlike in Europe where\nstandardisation is the goal between countries, Asia Pacific will remain\ndiverse and different for the foreseeable future, but that makes doing\nbusiness here far more interesting!\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Inna-Wahlberg-\nheadshot-1.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Inna-Wahlberg-\nheadshot-1.jpg)\n\nInna Wahlberg is the General Manager of Asia Services at Ascender.  \n---  \n  \nThis year, we can expect to see a similar pace of regulatory and technical\nchange as we have grown accustomed to in previous years, but we also expect to\nsee a heightened focus on employee wellness and engagement as an emerging\ntrend in the region. The continuously evolving regulatory landscape will keep\ncompliance on the forefront businesses in this region as well.\n\nTo help organisations prepare for upcoming changes, we will shed some light on\nwhat to expect in 2020, and why.\n\n**Enforcing accurate, timely pay**\n\nEmployees care deeply about their pay. This is fundamental. Getting pay right\nhas still proven quite difficult for organisations to achieve. We also see an\nemerging interest in pay equity across the region. Employees are starting to\npay more attention to the notion of equal pay for equal work, and they are\nbecoming more open to talking about this in the workplace.\n\nTo accomplish pay transparency, HR and payroll managers first need to\nestablish trust. In a \u2018gig economy\u2019 with a more contingent workforce\nconsisting increasingly of part-time or freelance team members, each\ncompensation package is unique, which means clear communication about the set-\nup of the total compensation package is critical.\n\nGiven the transformation in the way we work, legislators will also watch this\nspace closely, applying more scrutiny and stricter legislation to affected\nindustries in an effort to protect the workforce from adverse effects, such as\nwage theft. While more precise practices can add complexity to payroll,\ncompliance will ultimately help build employee confidence and enhance the\norganisation's reputation.\n\n**The importance of employee wellness**\n\nEmployee Health and Safety has been a key focus area in many organisations for\na number of years. However, in 2020, we are seeing a subtle but important\nshift towards focus on Employee Wellness. Wellness as a trend encompasses both\nphysical but also mental wellbeing and employees are starting to think more\nholistically about what this means for their workforce.\n\nWe now experience a growing emphasis on agile working across Asia. According\nto results from Randstad Workmonitor, 87% of Singaporeans said that having the\nautonomy to work at an offsite location increases their productivity,\ncreativity, and job satisfaction. Similar trends can be seen in other Asian\ncountries too. This puts more pressure on employers to provide better\nfacilities in support of such ways of working, and focus on personal health\nand flexible work arrangements. We also see many companies are already\nembracing the trend by incorporating more meaningful perks and employee\nbenefits to their portfolio.\n\nLast year, Microsoft in Japan implemented a four-day work week initiative,\nwhich, according to the company, led to a 40% boost in productivity. With\nglobal organisations leading the way with such policies, these discussions are\npoised to have a broader impact for businesses.\n\n**Impact of legislation**\n\nIn 2020 we expect the volume of statutory and legislative changes across Asia\nto continue to gradually increase, as the drive for increasing transparency\nfor employees with regards to payroll and HR policies grows, which in turn\nwill add complexity to businesses operating in the region. Additionally,\ndiverse local statutes are supplemented by additional cross-border regulation\nsuch as most notably the EU\u2019s GDPR, which will have an impact on how companies\noperate in the region.\n\nA sampling of key legislative changes that have already taken effect include\nSingapore, where the Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions for workers\nover 55 years of age will steadily increase each year to a new maximum level\nin 2030. In China, the government recently completed a significant overhaul of\nthe income tax system introducing more complexity in payroll management\nlocally. In Malaysia, when the Minimum Wages Order 2020 comes into effect, two\ndifferent sets of minimum wage rates will start to apply.\n\nWe expect similar changes to continue to occur in 2020 and beyond.\n\n**What does this mean for organisations in APAC in 2020?**\n\nIn 2020, organisations operating in APAC must increasingly start to shift\ntheir attention from merely managing the complex and continuously evolving\nregulatory landscape into topics like employee wellbeing and engagement.\nEngaged employees are likely to be much more productive and loyal. This is\nimportant because there is a clear linkage between a happy team and improved\nclient satisfaction. Happy employees provide great service, and that in turn\nboosts the company's bottom line.\n\nRegardless of where your business is based, it is imperative to remain\ncompliant both from legal, social, and individual perspectives. Those who can\nadapt quickly will thrive in this market over time.\n\n|  \n\n* * *\n\n  | [![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/pink1.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/pink1.png)  \n---|---|---  \n|\n\n**Ascender** is a Premium Sponsor of the upcoming  \n[HR Tech Festival Asia\n2020](https://www.hrtechfestivalasia.com/?utm_source=hrmasiablog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=HR%20Tech%20Festival%20Asia%202020%20-%20Blog%20Post)\n(29 \u2013 30 September, Singapore),  \nthe region\u2019s largest HR technology conference and exhibition.  \nLearn more about their solutions at the event.\n\n| [**Register to attend the event today!\n__**](https://www.hrtechfestivalasia.com/registration?utm_source=hrmasiablog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=HR%20Tech%20Festival%20Asia%202020%20-%20Blog%20Post%20Register)  \n---  \n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/blue1.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/blue1.png) |  |  \n|  |  \n---|---|---  \n|  |  \n|  |  \n  \n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2F2020-payroll-\nand-hr-trends-in-asia%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=2020+Payroll+and+HR+Trends+in+Asia&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2F2020-payroll-\nand-hr-trends-in-asia%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2F2020-payroll-\nand-hr-trends-in-asia%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

has decided to allow employees of the\nfinance or human resources division in the private sector to work for just one\nday to process payroll in accordance with the law.\n\nAccording to the Human Resources Ministry (KSM), only two employees are\nallowed for this purpose during the implementation of the movement control\norder (MCO).\n\n\"They are allowed to go to their workplace to carry out specific work for just\none day, whether on March 31 or April 1, to coordinate the payroll process for\nworkers\u2019 wages,\" the ministry said in a statement on Monday ( March 30).\n\nFor this, the employer is required to provide a letter or document of release\nand authorisation for these employees to be at their workplace.\n\nThe release letter or document must include the employee's full name and\nidentity card number as well as the employer's telephone number for\nverification purposes.\n\nThis letter will facilitate their movement to the workplace if the employees\nare requested to show the evidence of authorisation to the authorities. -\nBernama\n\nArticle type: free\n\nUser access status:\n\nTags / Keywords: [Human Resource](/search?q=Human Resource) ,

Not having an accurate and reliable payroll solution lead to a\ncostly mistake involving manpower and wasted time -- the knock-on effects are\njust as damaging.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\nA study by the Workplace Institute found that 24% of people will start looking\nfor a new job as soon as they experience a mistake by payroll.\n\nThis figure rises to 49% for the second mistake. And roughly half of all\nemployees have experienced one or more errors. This has huge implications for\nretention strategies, with so many disgruntled employees looking to leave.\n\nRecruitment and retention are two hot-button topics in Asia, so having lots of\npayroll errors will simply push staffers to leave.\n\n\"You need to have a solid foundation to build a skyscraper,\" said Ellis. \"For\na company, that involves having an accurate and secure payroll system as part\nof its core functions.\"\n\n**Trend #3: Systems need to grow with companies**  \nA lot of growing companies start by investing in payroll solutions but simply\npick something off the shelf, usually making sure it's cloud based.\n\nBut a payroll system that is \"not well planned\" can soon become clunky and\nhard to maintain as the company and its headcount grows.\n\nAdd to that the challenge of scaling to deliver increasingly complex payroll\ncapabilities as a firm starts growing its headcount above 500 employees.\n\nBeyond Payroll, HR may need extra functionality to help with recruitment or to\ninstall a performance-goal system. As systems and functionality are added on\ntop of the company's basic payroll system, integration, management and\nreporting gets increasingly complicated and expensive to manage.\n\nThis is where a fully integrated system shows its advantages in terms of cost\nand ease of use. As a company grows, such a system is robust and flexible\nenough to grow with it.\n\n\"I tell my clients it's a bit like learning to swim in the kiddie's pool,\"\nEllis said. \"It will soon be too small and you will have to move to a bigger\npool.\n\n\"So why not just learn to swim in the big pool, but ring-fence so it can\nexpand as you get better.''\n\n_Mike Ellis will be talking about these challenges and more in a webinar\ntaking place on March 11.[Click here to register and find out more about the\nlatest trends in 2020](http://go.rizing.com/HCM-WBN-2020-03-11APACWebinar_LP-\nRegistration.html?utm_source=HRDMedia&utm_medium=eDM&utm_campaign=Payroll)._\n\n### Related stories\n\n  * [This type of employee is 'passed over' for promotion](/asia/news/general/this-type-of-employee-is-passed-over-for-promotion/174821)\n  * [How to land a promotion in a robotic world](/asia/specialisation/hr-technology/how-to-land-a-promotion-in-a-robotic-world/153972)\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily newsletters\nfrom HRD Asia.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n### Recent articles & video\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637218764030398689.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-\nbreaker-mom-advises-against-prolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: MOM advises against 'prolonged' no-pay\nleave](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-breaker-mom-advises-against-\nprolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218756963772601.jpg)](/asia/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219166)\n\n#### [How has COVID-19 impacted managers and\nemployees?](/asia/news/general/how-has-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-\nemployees/219166)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218753186012580.jpg)](/asia/news/general/ceo-\nof-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-from-a-challenge/219160)\n\n#### [CEO of HP Canada: 'I was never one to shy away from a\nchallenge'](/asia/news/general/ceo-of-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-\nfrom-a-challenge/219160)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217706478717086.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/change-\nmanagement/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-support-employees/219005)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: How can HR support\nemployees?](/asia/specialisation/change-management/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-\nsupport-employees/219005)\n\n### Most Read Articles\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n06 Apr 2020\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n__\n\n  * [HRT](https://www.hrtechnologynews.com/)\n  * [Companies](/asia/companies)\n  * [People](/asia/people)\n  * [Newsletter](/asia/newsletter)\n\n  * [About us](/asia/about-us)\n  * [Authors](/asia/authors)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/asia/privacy-policy)\n  * [Conditions of use](/asia/conditions-of-use)\n  * [Contact us](/asia/contact-us)\n  * [RSS __](/asia/rss)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/HumanResourcesDirectorAsia/)[__](https://twitter.com/HRD_Asia)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/human-\nresources-director-asia)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Key Media ![](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n"}, {"item": "Qualitative report on HR Payroll Software Market progressive growth during 2020-26 by Kronos, Sage, Ascentis, Success factors, Pay Focus, Bamboohr, Kenexa, Ultipro -

With global markets reeling and citizens confined to their\nhomes, the coming weeks and months will put companies\u2019 business continuity\nplans to the test as never before.\n\nMany governments are moving swiftly to introduce new measures to support the\neconomy and their populations during these difficult circumstances. A list of\ngovernment support schemes can be found [here](/en/news-\ninsights/coronavirus/government-support-schemes/).\n\nBusinesses will need to adapt their systems and structures to keep up with the\nchanging legislation. Companies should always prioritise the best interests of\ntheir staff wherever possible, and HR and payroll issues should be the focus\nnow.\n\nEnsuring people are paid the right amount at the right time is crucial to\nmaintaining trust and motivation of employees and can be a challenge at any\ntime. Now with sharp economic shock, companies of all sizes will come under\nintense pressure to get it right.\n\n### Evolving laws\n\nCompanies have an obligation to stay on top of emergency legislation as it is\nannounced, and rapidly integrate it into their policies. For multinational\ncompanies, this adds another level of complexity. Clear communication and\nprocesses are more important than ever and will be key to managing uncertainty\namong employees and third parties as the situation evolves.\n\nFrom an HR and payroll perspective, there will be changes relating to sick\npay, overtime, and leave \u2212 compassionate leave in particular.\n\nIn the UK, for example, there has already been a move from the government to\nfund statutory sick pay (SSP) relating to coronavirus for businesses with\nfewer than 250 employees. Similarly, it has changed legislation to enable SSP\nto be paid from day one rather than day four, as is usually the case.\nCompanies now need to ensure this update is reflected throughout their systems\nand that payroll is adjusted.\n\nIt is likely that other countries will adopt similar measures, and further\ndown the line we may well see SSP extended to cover longer periods.\n\nPayroll taxes are another area where countries have been passing legislation\nto help businesses. For example, in Australia, there have been payroll tax\nwaivers passed in Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania. Each scheme\ncontains different specifics, such as deferral time and payroll amounts. It is\nimperative that companies pay close attention to the new rules and apply them\nto their current payroll systems in each jurisdiction.\n\nUnemployment benefits are another focus of governments around the world as\nbusinesses are being shuttered for indeterminate amounts of time. For example\nin the Netherlands, companies faced with a loss of turnover can apply for the\ngovernment scheme \u2018Emergency fund bridging employment\u2019 intended to allow\ncompanies to pay their employees on permanent and flexible contract.\nVariations of unemployment benefit schemes are being adopted worldwide.\n\n### The new normal\n\nWith staff welfare a top priority, some companies may decide to go beyond the\nlegal requirements and voluntarily adopt measures to ease the stress and\nfinancial burden on their staff.\n\nThis will also help companies maintain a strong employer reputation when the\ncrisis comes to end. Such policies could include paid leave to allow people to\ncare for relatives, or to support self-isolation.\n\nWith travel restrictions in place and sickness causing last-minute changes of\nplan, there will be an increased number of employees wanting to cancel or move\nleave. Flexibility regarding adjusting paid and unpaid holiday is another area\nsome companies may wish to explore. Accommodating this will require\nadjustments to policies and internal working practices to ensure everything\nremains in sync.\n\nOvertime policy and the use of contractors may need to be reconsidered, as\nemployees look to find workarounds in the new normal. This will have\nimplications for payroll and tax in both the short- and medium-term.\n\n### Dealing with change\n\nFaced with an astounding amount of changes, companies must focus on\nmaintaining clear communication with staff, including updating handbooks. They\nmust ensure all new policies are consistent across jurisdictions but fall\nwithin the limits of local regulations.\n\nThere is also a possibility of the lack of adequate staff to deal with filing\nand processing, as well as delays to third-party payments. Workflows and\nprocesses will need to be adapted in anticipation of this. Mitigating the\nrisks of late payroll or non-payment needs to be a priority. If any delays are\nexpected to payroll, this needs to be flagged clearly and early.\n\nThe first step is to conduct a workflow analysis to identify processes that\nare critical in paying employees and filing tax obligations. Can all of the\nsystems be accessed remotely?\n\nResourcing is another issue that needs considering. Are there adequate back-up\nstaff if key team members are unavailable? As far as possible, Companies need\nto ensure a broad knowledge base and avoid skillsets being siloed.\n\nThird parties and partners need to be kept informed about any changes to ways\nof working, or potential delays in payment or processing. They, too, could\ninstitute new workflows and these changes need to be reflected and shared\naround companies.\n\nFinally \u2013 and crucially \u2013 there needs to be clear communication to employees.\n\nWith further uncertainty ahead, ensuring policies and systems are in place to\nsupport staff and staying on top of the constantly evolving legislation in\nevery jurisdiction where your company operates must be the immediate focus for\nall businesses.\n\n_The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter.

First, reduce non-wage costs, and consider various measures to utilise and manage excess manpower.\n  2. Second, tap on government support to offset business and wage costs, and press on with business and workforce transformation.\n  3. Third, trim wage costs.\n  4. Fourth, if it is necessary to retrench workers as a last resort, ensure it is done in a responsible manner.\n\n**Implement a 'fairer' pay cut**  \nDespite best efforts, NWC acknowledged that employers may still find it\nnecessary to cute wages in order to save jobs.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\nTo ensure fair wage practices, the council offered the following guidelines:\n\n  * **Management should lead by example before giving staff a pay cut**\n\nAs pay cuts, especially those over an extended period, will affect employees'\nlivelihoods, employers should seek the consent of unions and engage employees\nbefore implementing such measures.\n\n  * **Consider all aspects of pay packages**\n\nWhen deciding on a fair pay cut, employers should take into account other\nfactors of their regular packages like commission and overtime pay.\n\n  * **Consider a 'flexible wage' system**\n\nTap on the monthly variable component (MVC) to adjust wages immediately\ndepending on business performance. If you haven't included the MVC in\nemployees' basic pay, consider treating any cuts of up to 10% as an MVC cut.\n\nEmployers should be clear about returning the amount cut during the recession\nthrough future pay rises or when the business recovers. Similarly, the MVC\nsystem needs to be discussed with existing employee unions.\n\n  * **Aim to pay the 13th month bonus or AWS**\n\nAs far as possible, employers should aim to offer employees the annual wage\nsupplement at the end of the year. This may support retention efforts and\ninspire loyalty through a difficult period, helping the business recover\nfurther.\n\n  * **Apply all pay cuts fairly**\n\nLocal and foreign employees should receive the same treatment.\n\n  * **Soften impact on low-wage workers**\n\nAny wage adjustments may hit low-wage employees harder. Therefore the NWC\nstrongly urged employers to give 'special consideration' to them - especially\nif they're frontline workers.\n\nOne way to soften the blow is to use a 'graduated' approach: implement deeper\ncuts for leaders and higher-wage staff first to save on total wage costs.\n\n[READ MORE: HR's \"winning strategy\" for cost-cutting\ndrama](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/news/general/hrs-winning-strategy-for-cost-\ncutting-drama/217812)\n\nNWC recognised that some employers may still be thriving despite the general\neconomic situation. They suggested that these employers should continue to\nreward employees with bonuses commensurate with the company's performance and\nthe employees' performance.\n\nThe annual wage guidelines should apply to all employees - PMETs and rank-and-\nfile employees, in unionised and non-unionised firms, in both the public and\nprivate sectors. They should also apply to re-employed employees, reminded\nNWC.\n\n### Related stories\n\n  * [Why HR should monitor the company's financial

A portion of the loan (up to eight\nweeks of covered costs) is eligible for forgiveness if certain conditions are\nmet. Employers can maximize the amount of loan forgiveness they will receive\nby keeping employees on the payroll or bringing back workers quickly and by\nkeeping wages above 75 percent of pre-crisis levels.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The Paycheck Protection Program provides small businesses with a strong\neconomic incentive to bring back laid-off or furloughed workers,\" Mucci added.\n\"For many industries, like restaurants and retail stores, lacking the\nsignificant funds required to cover employee payrolls during this turbulent\ntime has been one of the most challenging impacts of the coronavirus pandemic\nto date.\"\n\nWhile Paychex customers can now obtain the required payroll information needed\nto quickly apply for a forgivable loan, it is important to note that\nparticipation in this program may preclude eligibility for other programs.\nBusinesses should consult with an accountant or other trusted financial\nadvisor to understand the best relief initiative for their business.\n\nBusinesses can find the application for the Paycheck Protection Program\n[here](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2770531-1&h=460407480&u=https%3A%2F%2Fhome.treasury.gov%2Fsystem%2Ffiles%2F136%2FPaycheck-\nProtection-Program-Application-3-30-2020-v3.pdf&a=here).

Check it out:\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/payroll-fintech-paylocity-\nacquires-video-communication-platform-vidgrid/) __\n\n[Paylocity](https://www.paylocity.com/), which provides HR and payroll\nservices, has acquired [VidGrid](https://www.vidgrid.com/), which works with\npeer-to-peer video services, according to a [press\nrelease](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paylocity-announces-acquisition-\nvidgrid-130000229.html).\n\nPaylocity said the partnership will help enable more connectivity for workers,\nparticularly amid the rise in working from home and other remote opportunities\n\u2014 factors more important now than ever with the\n[coronavirus](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/coronavirus/) pandemic mandating\npeople stay out of public gatherings.\n\nVidGrid will help Paylocity in the fields of employee collaboration, allowing\nfor more flexibility in how co-workers talk to one another in the modern day,\nwhich the company said it hopes will lead to greater retention of employees\nand more engagement with the businesses using VidGrid as a whole.\n\nPaylocity has already used VidGrid for years to put out a Learning Management\nSystem (LMS) program allowing employers to use videos from outside parties to\ndistribute expert knowledge in various subjects to employees. With growing\nneed from clients, Paylocity saw an opportunity to \"expand the relationship\"\nby acquiring VidGrid, the press release stated.\n\nUsing videos will become more and more important for businesses as the\ndefinition of work expands, including more remote positions and other such\nchanges to the traditional office sphere. Thus, VidGrid was a choice to help\nPaylocity better respond to its customers, the press release stated.\n\nPaylocity CEO Steve Beauchamp said the implementation of videos would be\ncrucial as the world evolves. He said VidGrid shared Paylocity's dedication to\ndoing good work for clients.\n\nNick Stokman, co-founder and CEO of VidGrid, said he wants to help foster\nbetter communication everywhere and looks forward to the future of the two\ncompanies now intertwined.\n\nPaylocity has been doing its best to keep up with the times in terms of\npayments and has recently rolled out an [on-demand\npayment](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/paylocity-gig-economy-\npayroll-wage/) service which the company said will help people get paid\nfaster, without the sometimes cumbersome and slow once- or twice-a-month pay\ncycles that used to be the norm.\n\nBeauchamp said many young people are used to gig economy jobs that paid\nfaster, and, upon being told they'd only be paid a few times a month, found\nthat incompatible with their lifestyles.\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

Departments in Facing Covid-19 With Its Cloud-\nBased Human Resource Management Solution\n\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\n **[MyWave Sdn Bhd](http://www.mywave.biz/) (MyWave), a specialist human\nresource (HR) solutions company that is partially owned by Malaysia Venture\nCapital Management Bhd (MAVCAP) announced that its cloud-based Human Resource\nManagement (HRM) solution, [EmpIX](http://www.emplx.com/) can help to\nalleviate the challenges faced by HR managers due to Covid-19.**  \n  \n**Khoo Siew Ling, CEO of MyWave Sdn Bhd** said, \u201cThese are unprecedented times\nfor those handling HR. Now and more than ever, they need to rely on technology\nto ensure smooth HR management. With the Movement Control Order (MCO) now\nenforced in Malaysia, HR managers play an important role and one of the\nimmediate challenges they face is in the areas of managing employees\u2019\nattendance and payroll.\u201d  \n  \nHR managers need to find ways to remotely fulfil their responsibilities since\nmost business premises being ordered to close during this period, without\nbeing able to access the usual systems and documentation in the office. This\ninclude tracking attendance of staff working from home, handling unpaid or\nsick leave of impacted staff, and processing payroll and claims.\n\nWith MyWave\u2019s cloud-based HRM solution, HR managers can access all the data\nthey need anytime and anywhere, with minimal interaction and data entry\nrequired. By using EmpIX\u2019 mobile attendance system, employee attendance\ntracking can be done, and staff can submit claims from home by uploading\nphotograph of receipts into the system.\n\nKhoo stressed that as the coming months are still shrouded with uncertainty\nand there may be changes in the treatment of income tax and Employee\u2019s\nProvident Fund (EPF), HR managers will need easy-to-use technology solutions\nto enable them to quickly comply to the new guidelines and rulings. For those\nin the manufacturing, food and beverage, and logistic industries where\nmanpower are mainly on shifts, digitisation of HR is crucial for business\nsurvival and can help businesses save as much as 60 percent processing time.\n\n\u201cOur outsourcing services can also aid companies in applying for the RM600\nunpaid leave allowance announced by the government as well as in handling the\nissues of staff retrenchment and pay deduction. Additionally, SMEs which are\nshorthanded, or if they do not have a dedicated person to handle HR, can\nconsider outsourcing their payroll function to us\u201d, said Khoo.\n\nMyWave is one of the HR Payroll technology solution providers listed in the\n[SME Business Digitization Grant](https://mdec.my/digital-economy-\ninitiatives/for-the-industry/sme-digitalisation-grant/) launched by Malaysia\nDigital Economy Corporation (MDEC) recently where the government will provide\na 50 percent matching grant of up to RM5,000 per company for SMEs applying to\nupgrade their systems.\n\n[Tweet](http://twitter.com/share)\n\nPRESS RELEASES\n\n  * [2020](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2020)\n  * [2019](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2019)\n  * [2018](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2018)\n  * [2017](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2017)\n  * [2016](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2016)\n  * [2015](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2015)\n  * [2014](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2014)\n  * [2013](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2013)\n  * [2012](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2012)\n  * [2011](https://datastorageasean.com/press-releases/2011)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n# Advertisement Here\n\n## Advertisement\n\n![](https://datastorageasean.com/sites/all/themes/storage/images/logo_bottom.png)\n\n  * [Home](https://datastorageasean.com)\n  * [News](https://datastorageasean.com/news)\n  * [Features](https://datastorageasean.com/features)\n  * [Research](https://datastorageasean.com/research)\n  * [Bloggers](https://datastorageasean.com/community_vendor_page)\n  * [Big Data](/category/big-data)\n  * [Cloud Storage](/category/cloud-storage)\n  * [Storage And Virtualization](/category/storage-and-virtualization)\n  * [Network Storage](/category/network-storage)\n  * [Data Backup](/category/data-backup)\n  * [Data Protection](/category/data-protection)\n  * [Data Storage Management](/category/data-storage-management)\n  *   \n[Storage Strategy](/category/storage-strategy)\n\n  * [Privacy](https://datastorageasean.com/privacy-policy)\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 Asia Online Publishing Group Sdn.

But when it\ncomes to our time, we hardly give it a second thought. The good news is that\nthere are easy ways to take some of your time back. Process-oriented tasks\nthat can't be automated should at the very least be delegated or outsourced.\nIf it's a low-risk, repeatable, non-complex task that somebody else can do for\nyou at fraction of what your hourly rate is, why are you still doing it? Most\ndecisions are reversible and should be made quickly. If it's not necessary to\nhave a meeting (it's usually not), use asynchronous communication tools; the\nreality is that most things don't require an immediate response. While you'll\ninitially have to spend some time to make time, like compound interest, over\nthe long-term, you will save exponentially more time than you invest.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/04/Apr20_07_678756706.jpg)\nMirageC/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/04/productivity-skills-to-help-you-gain-time-\nback?language=es)\n\nWe\u2019re all busy \u2014 so busy. We have bills to pay, a mortgage to service, kids to\ntake care of, and of course, work deadlines to meet. All of these commitments\nleave us with little meaningful time for ourselves, and for cultivating\nmeaningful relationships with others. But the good news is: When we say we\u2019re\ntime-poor, what we really mean is that we\u2019re decision-poor. And that\u2019s\nsomething we can change.\n\nMost of us are incredibly careful about how we spend our money. But when it\ncomes to our time, we hardly give it a second thought. We say yes to all sorts\nof nonsensical requests for our time; we treat everything as urgent; we attend\npointless meetings; we refuse to delegate work for fear that quality will be\ncompromised; we spend our days tethered to our inboxes and our smartphones;\nand we stubbornly continue to perform tasks that a machine could do for us.\n\nUnlike money though, time can\u2019t be earned back.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to derive a sense of identity or status from the hustle, but what\u2019s\nit ultimately for? As palliative care nurse Bronnie Ware noted in her book,\n_[The Top Five Regrets of the Dying](https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-\nthe-dying/)_ , one of the biggest regrets that people had on their deathbeds\nwas that they\u2019d worked too hard.\n\n#### Insight Center\n\n  * ###### [The Era of Job Crafting](/insight-center/the-era-of-job-crafting)\n\nSponsored by Upwork\n\nDesign the work you want.\n\nStep one toward joining the new rich \u2014 those who use their time wisely, and\nthus have the luxury of more free time \u2014 is believing in the paradox that we\ncan actually get _more_ done in _less_ time, as I wrote in \u201c[The Case for the\n6-Hour Workday](/2018/12/the-case-for-the-6-hour-workday).\u201d Refusing to\nbelieve this is to resign yourself to a life of staring at screens for [eleven\nhours a day](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/staring-down-the-dangers-\nof-the-digital-workplace/). It\u2019s your choice.\n\nIf you choose to take back your time, here\u2019s how to get started:\n\n### **1\\. Automate**\n\nNowadays, all kinds of tasks can be automated. Sadly, too few entrepreneurs\nand business executives are taking advantage of the multitude of affordable\nand simple, yet effective, tools on the market.\n\nHere\u2019s a non-exhaustive snapshot of what can be automated:\n\n  * Legal: Data mining, contract review\n  * Sales: Lead generation, lead nurturing, proposal development, meeting preparation, customer intelligence, competitor intelligence\n  * Marketing: Email templates and marketing content syndication, content repurposing, content distribution\n  * IT: Data backups, network management, PC maintenance, account creation, file transfers, data extraction\n  * HR: Payroll scheduling, candidate recruiting\n  * Development/programming: Scripts to copy files and perform repetitive actions, the optimization of images\n  * Customer support: Surveys and questionnaires, customer inquiries\n\nTools you can start using today:\n\n  * Workflow management: Zapier.com, IFTTT.com\n  * Posting to social media: Buffer and HootSuite\n  * Appointment scheduling: Calendly.com\n  * Repurposing content: Repurpose.io\n\n### **2\\. Outsource  **\n\nProcess-oriented tasks that can\u2019t be automated should at the very least be\ndelegated or outsourced. If it\u2019s a low-risk, repeatable, non-complex task that\nsomebody else can do for you at fraction of what your hourly rate is, why are\nyou still doing it?\n\nIn an [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44) of the popular\nJoe Rogan Experience podcast, AngelList founder Naval Ravikant suggested\nsetting an aspirational hourly rate for yourself and sticking to it. \u201cNever do\nanything with your time for less than that amount \u2014 whether it\u2019s attending a\nmeeting or returning a package from Amazon\u2026If I have to return something, and\nit costs less than my personal hourly rate, I\u2019ll give it away.\u201d\n\nHaving worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs, I often show them the table\nbelow, created by author Perry Marshall, and ask, \u201cWhat percentage of your\ntime do you spend on $10-an-hour tasks?\u201d\n\n#### Is Your Work Worth $10 an Hour or $10,000 an Hour?\n\nHow are you really spending your time?  \n---  \n**$10 per hour tasks** | **$100 per hour tasks** | **$1,000 per hour tasks** |\n**$10,000 per hour tasks**  \nRunning errands | Solving a problem for a prospective or existing customer |\nPlanning and prioritizing your day | Improving your unique selling proposition  \nTalking to unqualified prospects | Talking to a qualified prospect |\nNegotiating with a qualified prospect | Creating new and better offers  \nCold-calling | Writing an email to prospects or customers | Building your\nsales funnel | Repositioning your message and position  \nBuilding and fixing stuff on your website | Creating marketing tests and\nexperiments | Judging marketing tests and experiments | Executing \u201cbolt from\nthe blue\u201d brilliant ideas  \nDoing expense reports | Managing pay-per-click campaigns | Creating pay-per-\nclick campaigns | Negotiating major deals  \nWorking \u201csocial media\u201d the way most people do | Doing social media well (this\nis rare) | Doing social media with extreme competence (this is very rare) |\nSelling to high-value customers and groups  \nCleaning, sorting | Outsourcing simple tasks | Delegating complex tasks |\nSelecting team members  \nAttending meetings | Customer follow up | Writing sales copy | Public speaking  \nSource: \u201c80/20 Sales and Marketing,\u201d by Perry Marshall | (C) HBR.org  \n  \n\u201cAbout half my time\u201d is the usual response. When I press people to outsource,\nthey respond without a hint of irony: \u201cI don\u2019t have time to do that!\u201d\n\nYou have to spend time to make time, but like compound interest, in the long-\nterm, you will save exponentially more time than you invest.\n\n\u201cBut it only takes me a few minutes a day to do it!\u201d Even a task that takes\nyou 5 minutes a day, 5 times a day, adds up to 15 workdays per year, not even\naccounting for the cognitive switching costs.\n\nTo outsource more low-value tasks, try tools such as:\n\n  * Day-to-day errands: GetMagic.com, TaskRabbit.com\n  * Creative tasks and virtual assistants: Upwork.com, Freelancer.com\n\n### **3\\. Use asynchronous communication**\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a necessary evil.\u201d These were the words of a former manager of mine at a\nleading Australian bank.\n\nI had asked why 12 people had to be present for periodic three-hours-long\nmeeting when 10 of them each had no more than five minutes of worthwhile\ncontributions to make.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a necessary evil, it was just inefficient and unproductive.\n\nThis lack of ownership, and tendency to outsource accountability by way of\nmulti-person, multi-hours-long meetings and reply-all email trails leaves\ncompany productivity stagnant and employee morale low.\n\nA better approach is the \u201cI\u2019ll get to it when it suits me\u201d philosophy that is\nat the core of asynchronous communication. The reality is that most things\ndon\u2019t require an immediate response, and that meetings shouldn\u2019t be used\nmerely to communicate information; we have email and instant messaging for\nthat.\n\nIf a discussion is warranted, then try scheduling shorter meetings, in 15- or\n30-minute increments, instead of the obligatory hour which is still the\ndefault at most organizations today. And if it\u2019s not necessary to have a\nmeeting (it\u2019s usually not), try one of these asynchronous communication tools:\n\n  * Instant message: Slack, Facebook Workplace, Microsoft Teams\n  * Project management: Asana, Trello, Basecamp, Airtable\n  * Pausing email and websites: Inbox Pause, Blocksite\n\n### **4\\. Stop treating all decisions like big decisions**\n\nIt\u2019s hard to talk about asynchronous communication without referring to what\nAmazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos calls [Type 1 and Type 2\ndecisions](https://media.corporate-\nir.net/media_files/irol/97/97664/reports/Shareholderletter97.pdf): Type 1\ndecisions are big, hairy, irreversible, and high-stakes. Type 2 decisions are\nreversible. If you screw up, you can make amends without too much, if any,\nharm having been caused.\n\nMost of our decisions are Type 2 decisions, and they should be made quickly.\nThe fewer decisions that are treated as Type 1 decisions, the less time will\nget eaten up with meetings and communications.\n\n### **5\\. Try task bundling**\n\nMulti-tasking is a myth, and [task-switching leaves us unproductive and\nexhausted](https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask), but that doesn\u2019t\nmean that we can\u2019t bundle tasks.\n\nKatherine Milkman, a behavioral economist at the Wharton School of the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, coined the term \u201c[temptation\nbundling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4381662/).\u201d It refers\nto bundling things you want to do with things you need to do, to help you\nbuild positive habits.\n\nLet\u2019s say my physiotherapist asked me to incorporate 30 minutes of mobility\ntraining into my day, three times a week. I could do this in isolation, or I\ncould combine it with something I want to do like watching a documentary on\nYouTube, or even taking a call on speaker.\n\nBy making fewer excuses, and investing the time required to design our work\nand personal lives, not only can we join the new rich, but we can cultivate a\nmore meaningful and less regrettable life.\n\nAs Roman Stoic philosopher [Seneca put\nit](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/01/seneca-on-the-shortness-of-\nlife/), \u201cLife is long if you know how to use it.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n[Steve

So what is the disconnect?\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | March 17, 2020\n\nTopics: [Digital Transformation](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/digital-\ntransformation/) | [Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/hrtechnology/) |\n[Leadership](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/leadership/)\n\n_Tom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/83424484_m.jpg)\n\nInjecting new or updated technology into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover US$5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a US$250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% said the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, said Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner.\n\nTinder said her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe said. In fairness, she noted, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn\u2019t matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder said. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don\u2019t have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d\n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, said that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she said, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille said.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explained.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explained. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he added.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte said, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he said, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears said. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nSears said traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder said, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears said, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook said, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he said. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook said. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook said HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concluded. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Dissecting+the+employer+disconnect+in+HR+technology&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

News](http://hrnews.co.uk/category/hr-news/)\n\u00bb Powering the Payroll Engine\n\nPosted on Mar 30, 2020\n\nby Richard Dutton, Account Director, Symatrix\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/money.jpg)\n\n\u201cMany organisations have made a significant investment in Tier 1 human capital\nmanagement (HCM) systems, the equivalent of the shiny red Tesla of the HR\ntechnology world \u2013 leading-edge technology and all the innovation that they\ncan fit under a bonnet. Yet, when it comes to payroll, many continue to run\nthese super-slick engines like a \u2018Mr Bean Mini\u2019. They now have access to a\nhigh-quality payroll engine as part of their HCM application but don\u2019t know\nhow to access, configure and make use of it to deliver an operationally\nexcellent solution to support either in-house or outsourced payroll\noperations.\n\nInstead, they often outsource payroll using a completely different application\nfrom HR and struggle with off-system manual workarounds, data mapping, error-\nstrewn reporting and resource-intensive administration. In car terms, they are\nusing a broom for an accelerator and trying to stick ropes round the steering\nwheel to keep themselves on track. This situation is often reached because the\npayroll function is not embedded in the selection and decision process.\n\n**Getting the HR approach right**\n\nBy investing in high-value HCM and then outsourcing payroll, organisations\ntend to run into a host of problems. The businesses that provide the outsource\npayroll service tend to say: \u2018just give us the HR data from your HCM tool and\nwe will run payroll for you\u2019 and make your payments to your employees.\nUnfortunately, though, they typically don\u2019t ask: is that HR tool set up to\nsupport the payroll process?\n\nThat means that a less streamlined and inefficient solution, which is also\ntypically more reliant on manual interventions, is delivered. By simply asking\nfor the HR data, the outsource provider will generally leave all the pain that\nis associated with running payroll efficiently with the client who is\nresponsible for getting the right data: in the right format for payroll but\nhas no skill or mechanism to optimise the collection of that data. The\noutsourcer will typically not have looked at, addressed or helped them with\nany of that HR flow, so the business will have to dedicate resource to the\ndifficult task of managing it, which mitigates against efficiency.  \n\nMoreover, because the service is so disjointed, there is huge risk for the\nbusiness. There is little or no governance associated with the approach and\nthe payroll that the business thought it was outsourcing to control and manage\ncosts, is costing twice as much as it should and very often riddled with risks\nof overpayments.  This results in total cost of ownership mounting up very\nquickly when you account for the additional resources required and the cost of\noverpayments and underpayments, rework and ensuring compliance.\n\n**Looking outside the business**\n\nWith access to the right level of expertise and understanding, however,\nbusinesses can go back into their HCM system to configure their HCM\napplications to be one source of the truth for both HR and payroll. Properly\nconfigured, HCM systems should provide one single employee record with all\nrelevant people data in it; including bank details, salary information,\nperformance data and absence data so that both HR and payroll can use it as\nrequired.\n\nUnfortunately, many businesses don\u2019t fully realise this is possible. Often\nthey buy a single cloud HR and payroll system but because they don\u2019t fully\nunderstand what payroll needs from an operationally-efficient approach, there\nare still lots of manual services and activities going on around it. They will\ngenerally need the assistance of an expert partner to help them get better\nvalue from the systems and bring HR and payroll skills into the mix.\n\nThe truth is that you have to have HR **and** payroll operating in tandem in a\nsingle system to gain full value from a HCM solution. But just like a car\nneeds regular servicing and a MOT, so too will the HR and payroll solution\nneed ongoing expert support over time. But you also need to wrap around the\ntechnology, the right governance and the right operating model to ensure that\npayroll continues to remain relevant and in line with requirements on a\nbusiness as usual (BAU) basis so they get the optimum value whenever it is\ntime for them to run the payroll.\n\nSo it is important to work with a partner who brings HR, technology and\npayroll skills together within a single system to drive operational excellence\nacross the whole data process. They need to know what great payroll looks like\nbut they also need to be aware that an efficient payroll is a consequence of\ngood HR. Any HCM system needs to have quality HR data but it also needs to be\ncarefully configured to support the payroll requirements of the business. That\nmeans that data coming out of the HCM system has been captured correctly and\nis ready for payroll to be calculated. This means that businesses can once\nagain have operationally-efficient payroll teams that have been freed up from\nhaving to do all the administrative work that they neither want nor need to do\nand are able to deliver in a very positive payroll that supports your\nemployees.\n\nThis positive payroll operation contributes to employees\u2019 financial well-\nbeing, including proactively telling employees when any arrangements are\nchanging so that they don\u2019t get any surprises. This proactive approach will\nalso result in a cost saving to the business because it will reduce calls\ncoming into the payroll team when payslips are issued.\n\nIn short, if businesses want a supercharged payroll engine rather than a\nsouped-up old vehicle they need to know that buying a high-quality HCM system\nwill not in itself be enough. Organisations must ensure that their outsourced\npayroll is properly configured with HR, ideally provided and fully supported\nby a single supplier, to reap the rewards.\u201d\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fpowering-\nthe-payroll-engine%2F&linkname=Powering%20the%20Payroll%20Engine\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fpowering-\nthe-payroll-engine%2F&linkname=Powering%20the%20Payroll%20Engine\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fpowering-\nthe-payroll-engine%2F&linkname=Powering%20the%20Payroll%20Engine\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fpowering-\nthe-payroll-engine%2F&linkname=Powering%20the%20Payroll%20Engine\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fpowering-\nthe-payroll-engine%2F&linkname=Powering%20the%20Payroll%20Engine\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/powering-the-payroll-engine/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/powering-the-payroll-engine/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/money-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=Powering the Payroll Engine)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/powering-the-payroll-engine/&text=Powering the Payroll Engine)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

The lack of integration between the\ncurrent payroll and HR systems is a major flaw.\n\n####  **Related:**\n\n **[SAP selected by government to test a replacement for Phoenix pay\nsystem](https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/sap-selected-by-government-to-\ntest-complexities-of-payroll-and-hr-requirements/428234)**\n\n **[SAP among 3 companies competing to replace\nPhoenix](https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/sap-among-3-companies-\ncompeting-to-replace-phoenix/418953)**\n\n\n\n\"The lifecycle management alone of the multiple HR systems\u2026being upgraded and\ntweaked and modified\u2026 all of those things happen in a sequence that is\ncompletely out of sync with each other. Because these are technologies that\nare often from the same company,\" explained Conlin. \"When you have a single\nintegrated system or a very defined integrated system, you can manage the\nlifecycle much easier.\"\n\nConlin confirmed that the initial planning to revamp the current system should\nbegin by the end of this week. Though no official timelines have been provided\nby either SAP or Canada\u2019s Treasury Board, Conlin did say he anticipates the\ntesting and implementation of these solutions to happen much quicker than the\nusual timeline of two years; pointing to the one year mark as a reasonable\ntarget.\n\nUpdating and maintaining the systems require a tremendous effort, but Conlin\nalso said simplifying the process of finding and fixing errors in the system\nwhen it is properly integrated is crucial.\n\n\"If there's an error somewhere in their systems today, the root cause analysis\ntakes an unbelievable amount of time, because you have to reverse engineer\nwith whatever one of the 40 systems that gas contributed to the error. It's\ncompletely unmanageable,\" said Conlin. \"So when you consider a single\nintegrated system with standardized business processes and with a common data\nmodel, payroll becomes an assembly. And the root cause goes back into the\nprocess, 'What slows down the process to cause this error?' That's a much more\nmeaningful root cause analysis.\"\n\nThe federal government says SAP's work with the new HR and pay system will be\nthe stepping stone to a more flexible procurement strategy for the future.\n\nBianca Healy, the manager of media relations for strategic communications and\nministerial affairs, confirmed in an email that they will be working with SAP\nCanada's team over the next few weeks to pilot the new solutions with the\nfinal goal of implementing those solutions incrementally across departments.\nEmployees will be a big part of the testing and feedback process, she added.\n\n\"In the coming weeks and months, SAP will work with the NextGen team on a\npilot which will test potential solutions against the real complexities of the\ngovernment\u2019s HR and pay requirements,\" said Bianca Healy, the manager of media\nrelations for strategic communications and ministerial affairs, said in the\nemail. \"Employees in the pilot department will continue to be paid through the\nPhoenix pay system. A department or departments have not yet been selected for\nthe pilot. Learnings and results from the pilot will help inform and define\nthe way forward.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n _* **Correction** : A previous version of this article incorrectly stated\nthat testing the current system was set to begin the same week this article\nwent live. However, it's just the initial planning that was set to begin\nduring this time. IT World Canada apologizes for the error._\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n**Related Download**  \n[![Create a Unique Selling Proposition for Your Global\nMarket](https://www.itworldcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/18015A.png)\n](https://www.itworldcanada.com/messagent.php?ID=QtSQzBSpqioQucRaI%2B1q2kbDoHguwtnu7qMnQBLC_Jbkfaon2ScNZ%2BYlzTXQ7GD8dAZfGi1UIR55DWBQQs&SOURCE=7bba919c-3f5a-8c92-cd4b-4db06aea724c&REF=WPL)\nSponsor: **EDC**  \n[ Create a Unique Selling Proposition for Your Global Market\n](https://www.itworldcanada.com/messagent.php?ID=QtSQzBSpqioQucRaI%2B1q2kbDoHguwtnu7qMnQBLC_Jbkfaon2ScNZ%2BYlzTXQ7GD8dAZfGi1UIR55DWBQQs&SOURCE=7bba919c-3f5a-8c92-cd4b-4db06aea724c&REF=WPL)  \n  \n[ Register Now\n](https://www.itworldcanada.com/messagent.php?ID=QtSQzBSpqioQucRaI%2B1q2kbDoHguwtnu7qMnQBLC_Jbkfaon2ScNZ%2BYlzTXQ7GD8dAZfGi1UIR55DWBQQs&SOURCE=7bba919c-3f5a-8c92-cd4b-4db06aea724c&REF=WPL)\n\n[ ![Tweet This](https://i.itworldcanada.com/uploads/social-twitter.png)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/phoenix-\nfollow-up-\nstory/428402&text=Fixing+%26%238216%3Bunmanageable%26%238217%3B+Phoenix+system+will+take+roughly+a+year%2C+says+SAP\n\"Post to Twitter\")[ ![Facebook](https://i.itworldcanada.com/uploads/social-\nfacebook.png)\n](http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/phoenix-\nfollow-up-\nstory/428402&t=Fixing+%26%238216%3Bunmanageable%26%238217%3B+Phoenix+system+will+take+roughly+a+year%2C+says+SAP\n\"Post to Facebook\")[ ![LinkedIn](https://i.itworldcanada.com/uploads/social-\nlinkedin.png)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/phoenix-\nfollow-up-story/428402&source=https://www.itworldcanada.com/ \"Share on\nLinkedIn\")\n\n__ [Emerging Tech](https://www.itworldcanada.com/category/emerging-tech) __\n[HR](https://www.itworldcanada.com/tag/hr),\n[payroll](https://www.itworldcanada.com/tag/payroll),\n[Phoenix](https://www.itworldcanada.com/tag/phoenix), [Phoenix pay\nsystem](https://www.itworldcanada.com/tag/phoenix-pay-system),\n[SAP](https://www.itworldcanada.com/tag/sap), [SAP\nCanada](https://www.itworldcanada.com/tag/sap-canada)\n\n[ ![](https://i.itworldcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Careers-\npanel-300x120.jpg) __Only one woman applied for information security job, a\nclear signal that 'something isn't working right'\n](https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/only-one-woman-applied-for-\ninformation-security-job-a-clear-signal-that-something-isnt-working-\nright/428421)\n\n[ ![Hashtag Trending - podcast banner](https://i.itworldcanada.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/07/ht_3000X1668-e1501855285944-300x120.jpg) Hashtag\nTrending - WWDC goes remote; ISPs and data caps; on-site workers at Google,\nFacebook __](https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/hashtag-trending-wwdc-goes-\nremote-isps-and-data-caps-on-site-workers-at-google-facebook/428459)\n\n  \n\n**About[Buckley Smith](https://www.itworldcanada.com/author/buckleysmith\n\"Buckley Smith\")**\n\n[![Buckley Smith](/wp-\ncontent/uploads/userphoto/4130.thumbnail.jpg)](https://www.itworldcanada.com/author/buckleysmith)\n\nStaff writer for IT World Canada.

While most employers are rightly prioritising the safety of\ntheir workers, employers also need to keep an eye on the new compliance\nrequirements.\n\nEmployers and HR teams should be making plans for the following changes:\n\n### Annualised salaries\n\nOn 1 March 2020, annualised salary clauses were inserted into several modern\nawards. This follows the decision of the Full Bench of the Fair Work\nCommission, which was made in response to widespread issues of 'wage theft'\nand employers failing to comply with awards.\n\nThese changes include obligations to audit annual salaries, record hours of\nwork, and back payments of any shortfall when annual salaries are audited\nagainst modern award entitlements.\n\nThe modern awards affected by these changes are:\n\n  * _Banking, Finance and Insurance Award 2010_\n  * _Clerks - Private Sector Award 2010_\n  * _Contract Call Centres Award 2010_\n  * _Hydrocarbons Industry (Upstream) Award 2010_\n  * _Legal Services Award 2010_\n  * _Mining Industry Award 2010_\n  * _Oil Refining and Manufacturing Award 2010 (clerical employees only)_\n  * _Salt Industry Award 2010_\n  * _Telecommunications Services Award 2010_\n  * _Water Industry Award 2010_\n  * _Wool Storage, Sampling and Testing Award 2010_\n\nIt was also held that some other Awards would have changes that required\nagreement between the employers and employees. These are:\n\n  * _Broadcasting and Recorded Entertainment Award 2010_\n  * _Local Government Industry Award 2010_\n  * _Manufacturing and Associated Industries and Occupations Award 2010_\n  * _Oil Refining and Manufacturing Award 2010 (non-clerical employees)_\n  * _Pharmacy Industry Award 2010_\n  * _Rail Industry Award 2010_\n  * _Horticulture Award_\n  * _Pastoral Award 2010_\n  * _Health Professionals Award 2010_\n  * _Marine Towage Award 2010_\n  * _Restaurant Industry Award 2010_\n  * _Hospitality Industry (General) Award 2010_\n\nWe recommend employers consider reviewing their current payroll and recording\nprocesses to ensure compliance by:\n\n  * Reviewing any common law 'set-off' clauses in employment contracts to ensure their clauses are appropriately drafted and valid;\n  * Reviewing time and record keeping processes and payroll systems;\n  * Implementing annual salary review and reconciliations;\n  * Considering undertaking regular payroll checks, with the advice from HR or legal advisors, to ensure compliance. This may also be done when new employees are engaged; and\n  * Considering if other forms of annualised salary options are more suitable to the employer. These include bargaining for an enterprise agreement, implementing an annual salary under a Modern Award, entering into an individual flexibility agreement with the employee or, for high income earners, entering into a guarantee of annual earnings.\n\nThe use of annualised salaries and common law 'set-off' clauses are still a\nviable option for employers. However care must be taken to ensure that they\nare drafted to comply with recent Fair Work Commission rulings. A general\nstatement allowing 'set-off' may not be sufficient.\n\nFor further information on the annualised salary clauses, refer to our\narticle: [ _Employers get ready for modern award changes in\n2020_](https://www.cbp.com.au/insights/insights/2019/november/employers-get-\nready-for-modern-award-changes-in-20).\n\n### Whistleblower laws\n\nOn 1 January 2020, new whistleblower protections laws came into effect, which\noffer greater protections to whistleblowers and require 'regulated entities'\nto publish whistleblower policies.\n\n'Regulated entities' include public companies and large proprietary companies.\n\nAs at 1 January 2020, the whistleblower policy should detail:\n\n  * The protections available to whistleblowers;\n  * To whom disclosures can be made;\n  * How the employer will support whistleblowers and protect them from detriment;\n  * Information about how the employer will investigate disclosures that qualify for protection;\n  * Information about how the employer will ensure fair treatment of employees of the company who are mentioned in disclosures that qualify for protection;\n  * Information about how the policy is to be made available to officers and employees of the employer.\n\nEmployers are encouraged to:\n\n  * Review any existing policies to ensure compliance with the changes or implementing a comprehensive new policy; and\n  * Undertake appropriate training to deal with the new legislation, particularly for managers and supervisors who will be classified as recipients of a disclosure.\n\nFor further information on the changes to whistleblower laws, please see our\narticles:\n\n  1. [ _Employers: get ready for new whistleblower protection laws in 2019_](https://www.cbp.com.au/insights/insights/2019/january/employers-get-ready-for-new-whistleblower-protect)\n  2. [ _ASIC releases Regulatory Guide on the content required in whistleblower policies._](https://www.cbp.com.au/insights/insights/2019/january/employers-get-ready-for-new-whistleblower-protect)\n\n### Other Upcoming Changes\n\nEmployers may expect:\n\n  * **Criminalisation of wage theft.** The Federal Attorney-General is pushing to introduce legislation to criminalise worker exploitation and underpayments. At this stage, the Attorney-General has only released a discussion paper on the issue. The Fair Work Ombudsman is also planning to establish an underpayments taskforce. Employers should review their governance processes for classifying staff and pay and overtime rates to ensure compliance.\n  * Now might be the time to review your current payroll practices to better understand where there might be compliance issues.\n\nIf you engage independent experts to assist with this process, it will be\nappropriate to seek advice in regards to the 'rules' and 'definitions' that\nshould be applied. You might even consider how you might ensure privilege over\nsuch processes.\n\n  * **Appeal of Mondelez to the High Court.** The appeal is yet to be listed for hearing in 2020, but it has potentially major ramifications and back pay claims for employers, particularly for those employers with non-standardised shift arrangements. Until the appeal is determined, employers are encouraged to review how they calculate personal/carers leave for shift workers and employees working more than 7.6 hours a day. The Fair Work Ombudsman has also updated its Fair Work Information Statement to address the Mondelez appeal.\n  * Again, now might be the time to review your current payroll practices to better understand where there might be compliance issues. Our comments in regards to 'rules', 'definitions' and privilege apply equally to reviews of how entitlements are accrued.\n\n  * **Modern Slavery Act reports due 31 December 2020.** Employers who are covered by the Commonwealth legislation should begin to prepare for the 31 December 2020 reporting deadline.\n  * **Potential increase to penalties under the Privacy Act.** In April 2019, a proposed penalty regime for breaches of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) was announced that would impose penalties for 'serious and repeated breaches' from $2.1 million to the greater of: $10 million; or three times the value of any benefit obtained through the misuse of information; or 10% of the company's annual domestic turnover. While the date of the proposed new regime has not yet been announced, we expect this to occur sometime in 2020. Employers should take time now to consider their privacy policies, audit procedures and staff training on privacy protection to ensure compliance with privacy laws and prevent the risk of being liable for substantial monetary penalties.\n  * **Increase to Victorian and New South Wales workplace manslaughter penalties.** Employers and directors should review their work health and safety policies and procedures to ensure they have a robust safety management system in place to reduce likelihood of incidents and manage their risk.\n  * **ABCC 's security of payment audits.** In December 2019, the ABCC announced that it will be conducting a security of payment audit campaign for employers covered by the Code for the Tendering and Performance of Building Work 2016 (Code). The ABCC has advised code covered entities to review progress payment claims submitted to them prior to the audit commencing to ensure all payments have been timely and that no claims that are due and payable are outstanding.\n\n### What can employers do?\n\nAs we all practice social distancing and working from home, employers and HR\nshould be taking time to consider the changes to the workplace laws and how\nthey can ensure compliance.\n\nThis may include:\n\n  * Considering what the above changes mean for your businesses and workforces;\n  * Reviewing any existing policies to ensure compliance with the changes or implementing new policies;\n  * Consider undertaking an audit of relevant systems (e.g. payroll, WHS and privacy policies and procedures) to understand any gaps; and\n  * Planning and undertake appropriate training to deal with the changes. Consider whether this training could be undertaken online for ease of employees in isolation.\n\n_The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter.

CARES Act\n\nApril 2, 2020\n\n![](https://files.taxfoundation.org/20190906145007/lajoie-150x150.png)\n\nTaylor LaJoie\n\n[](https://taxfoundation.org/staff/taylor-lajoie/)\n\n[ ![Twitter Logo](https://taxfoundation.org/wp-content/themes/tf-wp-\ntheme/images/icons/twitter.svg) ](https://twitter.com/@Taylor_LaJoie)\n\nTaylor LaJoie\n\nAmericans are still digesting the $2.2 trillion[ CARES\nAct](https://taxfoundation.org/cares-act-senate-coronavirus-bill-economic-\nrelief-plan/) (H.R. 748), which passed last week as the largest financial\nsupport package in U.S. history. The law runs more than 800 pages and contains\nhundreds of provisions designed to dispense relief to individuals and\nbusinesses in the wake of the ongoing public health crisis. While many\nAmericans are becoming more familiar with the rebate portion of the bill, the\nlegislation also supports small businesses and independent contractors.\n\nMany small business owners are seeking guidance as they apply for loans backed\nby the Small Business Administration (SBA) to help maintain cash flow and\nretain workers even as more states announce new quarantine and shelter-in-\nplace orders. The CARES Act includes financing options for small businesses\nowners and independent contractors, including the Paycheck Protection Program\n(PPP).\n\n## Overview of the Paycheck Protection Program\n\nTo incentivize employers to maintain payroll during the crisis, the SBA is\nproviding 100 percent federally-backed loans for certain payroll expenses\nthrough June 30, with up to eight weeks of forgiveness for small businesses,\ncertain nonprofits and self-employed individuals. The loans are forgivable if\nemployers retain employees at comparable salary levels prior to the crisis.\nThe PPP also waives all SBA fees and provides deferral on loan repayments for\na minimum of six months up to a maximum of one year.\n\nSmall businesses impacted by coronavirus-related issues between February 15\nand June 30, 2020 may apply for loans, which will remain available through the\nend of June. All 501(c)(3) nonprofits, 501(c)(19) veterans organizations,\ntribal businesses with fewer than 500 employees, individuals who manage a sole\nproprietorship, and independent contractors are eligible. Each entity is\nlimited to one loan, determined by the applicable taxpayer identification\nnumber (TIN).\n\nThe loans are categorized by how long the organization remains operable from\nthe beginning of the crisis period (February 15) to June 30. For businesses\nthat continue to operate and retain employees over that period, the SBA can\nprovide a maximum loan of 250 percent of the average monthly payroll costs\nduring that period:\n\n  * If you are in business over the period from February 15 to June 30, you will receive a maximum loan amount that is 2.5 times your average monthly payroll expenses over that time period.\n  * If you are a seasonal worker over the period from March 1 to June 30, you will receive a maximum loan amount that is 2.5 times your average monthly payroll expenses for that shortened time period.\n  * If you were not in business after February 15\u2014that is, if you were not open because of the crisis or you went out of business entirely\u2014you will receive a maximum loan amount that is 2.5 times your average monthly payroll expenses for the two months of January and February.\n\nBusinesses that took out economic injury disaster (EID) loans between February\n15 and June 30 may refinance their original loan into a PPP loan and add any\noutstanding loan payments to their payroll expenses.\n\nEligible payroll expenses for calculating PPP loan amounts include:\n\n  * Compensation (salary, wages, commission, or similar compensation, cash tips, etc.)\n  * Payment for vacation, family, medical, and sick leave\n  * Allowance for employee dismissal or separation\n  * Payment for group health-care benefits, including insurance premiums\n  * Payment of employee retirement benefits\n  * Payment of state and local taxes imposed on the compensation of employees\n\nHowever, the PPP does not count the following expenses when calculating the\ntotal PPP reimbursement amount:\n\n  * Any compensation over $100,000 per employee\n  * Taxes imposed under chapters 21 (payroll taxes), 22 (railroad taxes and retirement benefits), and 24 (income taxes withheld on wages) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC)\n  * Compensation of employees whose principal place of residence is outside the United States\n  * Qualified sick and family leave for which a credit is already allowed under other sections (i.e., 7001 and 7003) of the Family First Coronavirus Response Act\n  * Loans used for duplicate purposes of another SBA loan program already claimed by the applicant\n\nOnce an eligible small business or contractor receives the loan, they may use\nit for the following:\n\n  * Payroll costs\n  * Costs related to the continuation of group health-care benefits during periods of paid sick, medical, or family leave and insurance premiums\n  * Employee\u2019s salaries, commissions, or similar compensation\n  * Payments of interest on any mortgage obligations (not including prepayment fees or payment of principal on the mortgage itself)\n  * Rent (including rents under a lease agreement)\n  * Utilities\n  * Interest on any other debt obligations that were incurred before the relevant covered period (see Table 1)\n\nNotably, the SBA will fully forgive all loans under the PPP provided three\nrequirements are met:\n\n  * Loans are used exclusively for their intended purposes (see bullet points directly above)\n  * Loans are used to offset no more than eight weeks (the maximum amount of time payroll expenses would be fully offset) of eligible payroll expenses\n  * Businesses retain employees at salary levels comparable to before the crisis\n\nFor any amount of the loan used that does not meet the above criteria,\nbusinesses will have to repay the SBA. The Paycheck Protection Program\nprovides businesses with a maximum repayment window of 10 years with a top\ninterest rate of 4 percent, without loan fees or prepayment penalties. SBA\nwill issue regulations to ensure that any fees remain capped.\n\nCalculating which costs qualify for loan forgiveness is determined by a\nformula, designed to enable businesses to maintain payroll and retain\nemployees without substantially reducing employee compensation:\n\nForgivable portion (FP) = Payroll costs (PC) + any applicable mortgage\ninterest payments (MIP) + any covered utility payment (UP), or:\n\n> _FP = PC + MIP + UP_\n\nTo be approved for loan forgiveness, businesses must contact their lender\n(either SBA or whomever is relevant) and submit an application including\ndocumentation verifying the number of employees on payroll and their\ncompensation levels, along with all relevant documents showing payments on\nmortgage interest and utility payments. All current SBA 7(a) lenders are\neligible lenders for PPP, and the U.S. Department of Treasury is responsible\nfor authorizing new lenders.\n\nFurther, if a business claims a PPP loan, they are not eligible for the\nEmployee Retention Credit (which would provide a refundable payroll tax credit\nfor 50 percent of wages paid by eligible employers to certain employees during\nthe COVID-19 crisis) or the deferment of payment of employer payroll taxes\nuntil 2021.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn addition to the rebate available to individuals ($1,200 for single filers;\n$2,400 for married filers) and changes to business tax rules, the CARES Act is\noffering forgivable loans to businesses aiming to retain their employees and\nmanage payroll expenses through the crisis. By underwriting two months of\npayroll expenses through the PPP, the SBA is providing more flexibility for\nbusinesses facing difficult decisions to keep their employees while watching\ntheir bottom line.\n\n**Stay Informed on Tax Policy Research and Analysis**\n\nSelect State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut\nDelaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana\nIowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota\nMississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New\nMexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania\nRhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia\nWashington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming\n\n**Was this page helpful to you?**\n\nYes!\n\nNo\n\n**Thank You!**\n\nThe Tax Foundation works hard to provide insightful tax policy analysis.

We've known each other a good number of years\nand I've come to appreciate and admire his sharp wit and encyclopedic\nknowledge of the HR space. In this discussion, he offers his view on what we\nshould and should not be doing, the impact of regulation on the workplace and\nlets us in on the expansion happening with his firm, [Otter\nAdvisory](https://www.otteradvisory.com/).\n\n## Armchair epidemiologists\n\nFirst up, Otter is unambiguous about what he sees as a distracting and\npotentially dangerous trend:\n\n> I think my main advice at the moment is, if you're not an expert in a\n> particular field, leave that discussion to the experts. If you're not a\n> statistics expert, don't spend your afternoons making prediction graphs and\n> posting them on the internet because there are enough people doing that\n> already. Probably too many. If you're not a recognized expert don't pretend\n> to be one. I think the people that think they know what they're talking\n> about are probably the ones we need to be most afraid of at the moment. For\n> me, I think it's a case of treading carefully. The obvious things of looking\n> after your people comes first. Too much speculation and too much gazing into\n> crystal balls is not going to do us any good.\n\nFor more on that topic, readers might be interested in [this thread about\nexploding whales](https://twitter.com/dahowlett/status/1247162181960871941).\nSeriously. Moving on.\n\n## Doubling down on HR admin\n\nI've tended to a jaded view of HR as primarily an administrative function.\nOtter argues that while there is truth in that, rapdily introduced changes in\nlaw and regulation have placed extraordinary burdens on HR departments.\n\n> Most of the time you're right, administratives processes are pretty\n> standard, but at the moment, some of these processes are going to change\n> daily. For instance, what is a essential worker? In some countries it's very\n> clear but in some places like the UK, the government has not been\n> particularly clear at defining what is an essential. There are many more\n> examples and so I think for HR, these represent massive periods of\n> administrative disruption.\n\nEmployee tracking has featured in a few recent discussions. According to\nOtter, it is relatively easy to spin up a screen that notes when a person is\nsick but he regards this as a 'dumb idea,' reminding organizations that there\nare laws around this topic, regardless of pandemic conditions and that\norganizations considering this type of application should ask themselves about\nthe purpose this serves rather than making it up as they go along. I asked\nwhether it makes sense to partially suspend some of the laws around privacy in\nthese extraordinary circumstances. His reply was unequivocal:\n\n> I think the opposite. If you look, for instance, at GDPR, it contains\n> specific procedures for handling epidemics. So I think the law is actually\n> is pretty good for these things. I don't feel like all of these things\n> should be thrown out, partly because when this goes away, the controls don't\n> go away, they stay. So for instance, if you suddenly start introducing ID\n> cards in the UK and France, do you think when the virus has gone the\n> government's gonna delete all that data and say, okay, well, no more and no\n> SA and ls considering any form of change in procedures or surveillance to\n> work with internal haealth and data officers to fully understand the purpose\n> and ensure that whatever measures are brought in that they respect and\n> comply with legislation.\n\nThis will vary from country to country. For example, TripActions laid off\nemployes in the UK, USA and Australia but kept people in the Netherlands as it\napplies for emergency funding to cover payroll. In the UK, there is talk of\nextending the scope of business help to include forms of co-funding between\nVCs and the government that will allow startups to continue operations.\n\n## Strategic thinking\n\nMore generally, Otter urges HR departments to stick with what they are doing\nand ensure people are not only paid but paid correctly. This is not easy when\nlegislation and regulation is unfolding on a daily basis but not impossible.\nHe also reinforces the fact that law, custom and practice vary from place to\nplace and that it is vital HR departments communicate in weays that are\nappropriate to the locale. Further, Otter argues that while the kneejerk\nreaction to this kind of event are to institute broad brush cuts:\n\n> Now is a good time to be thinking about scenario planning for your long-term\n> workforce strategy. It might for example turn out that in some situations\n> remote working makes better sense for both employer and employee. But the\n> point is this - we don't know what will happen next but we can imagine a\n> variety of scenarios and plan around those. It's the best way to help the\n> board make the right decisions and act quickly once we see how the world\n> looks.\n\nAt this point. the conversation turned a tad philosophical and speculative but\nOtter brought up the point about climate change and how the new abnormal has\ntransformed once heavily polluted cities to have clear skies. He posits that\nthese types of obvious impact could well drive different policies which, in\nturn, impact they way we work. It's an interesting discussion and one that I'm\nsure will play out long into the future.\n\n## What's next?\n\nWe then turned to what Otter is doing with his firm.\n\n> I've always believed that we should use our expertise in a collaborative\n> fashion and in my field, one thing that technology companies struggle with\n> is marketing, which when done well as is a positive thing but when it's done\n> badly it's a swear word.\n\nTo that end, Otter recently partnered with Rachel Jenkins a seasoned marketing\nexpert who has worked at both startups and established global HR tech vendors.\n\n> It's all about less fluff and helping the smaller vendors collaborate well\n> with the large vendors. They both need each other but it is often difficult\n> for those small companies to get the attention they deserve. Also, those\n> smaller vendors often hire someone who is super smart and has a B2C\n> background where they need coaching on B2B. We want to help those people.\n> It's early days but let's see wherer this goes.\n\nAnd with that we were done.\n\n## My take\n\nChewing the fat with super smart people is always fun and Thomas Otter falls\nsquarely into that category of pragmatic thinkers who is looking around the\ncorner for what needs to be done next. His advice concerning policy change is\nwell taken while having an eye on the long-term may not resonate with some but\nmakes for good sense as we look ahead. What do you think? Let is know in the\ncomments.  \n\n_Image credit - YouTube video_\n\nRead more on:\n\n  * [HCM and the digital future of work](/category/hcm-hr-future-work)\n\n### New on

Changes are\nhappening to the \u201cwhite-collar\u201d exemptions that allow businesses to exempt\ncertain employees from overtime. These exemptions are for employees in jobs\nclassified as executive, administrative, professional, computer and outside\nsales. However, to qualify for an exemption, the employees must pass a variety\nof tests and meet the requirements described in the Department of Labor\u2019s\ndefinition of each job type.\n\nOne constant in each of the exemptions is compensation level. Currently, to\nqualify for the exemption, an employee must be compensated at a rate of no\nless than $455 per week \u2013 an annual salary of $23,660. The new rule increases\nthat level to $35,568.\n\n **The second major HR issue** businesses should watch out for in 2020 is the\nproliferation of paid sick and parental leave. This is when an employee\nreceives the same wages as if they worked. Currently, there is no federal sick\nleave law. However, 11 states and Washington, D.C. mandate paid sick leave.\nThis is often paid through an employee-funded payroll tax.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in one of these areas, adjust your policy accordingly,\u201d Seawright\nsays.\n\nThese state laws establish minimum requirements for paid sick leave, but an\nemployer may provide sick leave through its own existing sick leave or paid\ntime off plan. Businesses can establish different plans for different\ncategories of workers. Each plan must satisfy the requirements of the new law.\n\n **The third issue** to watch for in 2020 is salary history and criminal\ninquiry bans. More states and cities are legislating \u201cban-the-box\u201d rules. In\nOctober, 13 states and 14 cities have a private employer criminal inquiry ban\nin place.\n\nThe \u201cbox\u201d refers to the question on job applications that asks applicants\nwhether or not they have ever been convicted of a crime. Ban-the-box laws\nrequire employers to remove this question \u2013 as well as any other queries about\ncriminal history \u2013 from job applications.\n\nThese laws were designed to prevent discrimination against applicants with\ncriminal records. Typically, employers are restricted from inquiring about\ncriminal history until later in the hiring process. Some ban-the-box laws\nrestrict how employers can use information obtained in a background check or\nwhen the checks can be done, but still, background checks are a must.\n\n\u201cI urge you to do (background checks) if you don\u2019t,\u201d Seawright says.\n\n **The fourth HR issue** to watch in 2020 is the return of the Social Security\nno-match letter.\n\nThese letters are issued by the Social Security Administration indicating that\ninformation on a wage and tax statement (Form W-2) does not match SSA records.\nHorticulture businesses may remember these letters. They stopped in 2012, but\nthe administration restarted the program in March 2019 for digital filers. In\nOctober 2019, SSA began issuing no-match letters for employers that filed\npaper W-2s.\n\nWhile receipt of a no-match letter does not mean the employee is in the U.S.\nillegally and is unauthorized to work, Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(ICE) routinely asks employers as part of the an I-9 audit whether they have\nreceived no-match letters. Failure to correct a discrepancy could result in\nviolations or fines under immigration laws.\n\nThe mismatch could have nothing to do with the immigration status of the\nemployee in question, Seawright says. Often, these no-match letters are the\nresult of administrative or transcription errors.\n\n\u201cBut in essence,\u201d she says, \u201cit puts you on notice that a person could be here\nillegally.\u201d\n\nHowever, employers cannot use the letter alone as the basis for taking adverse\naction against an employee.\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/States_with_paid_sick_leave_map_fmt.png)\n\n **The fifth HR issue** to watch for in 2020 is minimum wage and market\npressure. There has been a high-profile push to raise the federal minimum wage\nto $15/hour. This has created an expectation and prospective employees don\u2019t\ncare if the \u201cindustry average\u201d is less than that. However, Seawright says that\nlocal market rates are what matter most. Employers who do not or cannot\nincrease their wages to keep pace with local market rates will struggle to\nattract and retain workers.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of pressure on small businesses to pay $15 an hour,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be considered a bad employer, not paying a living wage.\u201d\n\nCompensation rates do not exist in a vacuum. Companies feeling the pressure to\nincrease starting rates for entry-level jobs must consider current workers in\nthe same position or job family. Otherwise, they leave themselves open for\nmorale problems, lost trust, discrimination complaints and a perception that\ntheir pay is not \u201cfair.\u201d\n\nSeawright has several solutions for companies facing this pressure. First,\nobtain current local market compensation data from the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics or another reliable source. Next, adjust start rates for entry-\nlevel positions to align to market rates. Third, adjust rates of pay for\ncurrent workers in the same position or job family, taking their length of\nservice into account. She notes the importance of calling this a market\nadjustment and not a merit increase.\n\nShe suggests developing a formula to ensure employees with more longevity\nshould earn more than new hires in the same job family. For example, employees\nwith 1-2 years of experience could receive the market rate plus X%. Employees\nwith 3-4 years of experience could earn the market rate plus Y%.\n\n **The final HR issue** for companies in 2020 is the cannabis conundrum. The\ndecriminalization and legalization of marijuana \u2013 whether medicinal or\nrecreational \u2013 is changing the landscape for employers. Many states have\nstrengthened workplace protections for medical marijuana users, so employers\nare unclear on how far they can or should go.\n\nIf your business is located where marijuana can legally be used for medical or\nrecreational purposes, you could eliminate drug testing entirely or remove\ncannabis specifically from pre- or post-hire drug panels. That eliminates the\nrisk of a discrimination or retaliation complaint but increases other risks.\n\nSeawright recommends a balanced approach. Keep cannabis in all drug test\npanels. But in the event of a positive test, use the same procedure you would\nfor other medical conditions. Require the employee to provide a doctor\u2019s note\nconfirming that he or she can safely perform his or her job duties and\noutlining any limitations. If the business would have to make accommodations,\ndetermine whether they are reasonable or would impose a hardship. If there is\nreasonable suspicion of impairment, you may be able to terminate the employee\nor take other disciplinary action.\n\n\u201cTrain your managers to recognize signs of impairment,\u201d she says.\n\nMatt McClellan is managing editor of Nursery Management magazine, Lawn &\nLandscape\u2019s sister publication.\n\n# Q&A with the expert\n\n### Q & A with the Experts - QandAwiththeExpert\n\n[Subscribe](/subscribe/)\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\n  \n\n**To view Lawn & Landscape's Q&A; with the Expert, click the image below.**\n\n[![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/Ask_the_Experts_cover_fmt.png)](http://giecdn.blob.core.windows.net/fileuploads/document/2020/04/07/ask%20the%20experts_full_compressed.pdf)\n\n# A complementary combination\n\n### Features - Business Focus\n\nAfter hitting $1 million in revenue, Jason Vahle had to balance operating the\ncompany he owned with the addition of a franchise.\n\n[Subscribe](/subscribe/)\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\n  \n\n[ Brooke Bilyj ](/author/12352)\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/20190820_132313_fmt.png)Jason\nVahle purchased a lawn care franchise to allow Green Thumb to focus on\nlandscaping and lawn maintenance.\n\nPhotos courtesy of Green Thumb Lawn Care N\u2019 Landscape\n\nJason Vahle expected \u201cthe skies to part\u201d when his company reached $1 million\nin revenue. But when Green Thumb Lawn Care N\u2019 Landscape hit that milestone in\n2014, Vahle realized he\u2019d need some help to grow it any further. \u201cEveryone\ntalks about it like you hit one million bucks and things get easier after\nthat, but it felt like we made less money even though we did more business,\u201d\nVahle says. \u201cI realized that growth is not just about taking everything that\ncomes through the door. You need to find your niche.\u201d\n\nTo take his operation to the next level, Vahle decided to purchase a lawn care\nfranchise that would diversify his services while offering centralized\nsupport. That fall, he began the process of purchasing a Spring-Green Lawn\nCare franchise to handle lawn care services, allowing Green Thumb to focus on\nlandscaping and lawn maintenance.\n\n\u201cThis allowed me to have the best of both worlds,\u201d Vahle says.\n\nNow in its fifth year, Vahle\u2019s franchise in St. Charles, Mo., is projecting\n$700,000 in revenue, while Green Thumb is eyeing $1.3 million. A strategically\ncomplementary combination, each side of the business helps grow the other.\n\n#### Expanding services.\n\nVahle\u2019s career started in college, when TruGreen recruited him at a job fair\nin 1999. He changed his major and went to work for the largest lawn care\ncompany in the country, working his way up to operations manager of the St.\nLouis area within a few years.\n\nThen, with the goal of providing more personal service while leveraging the\nbest practices he learned at TruGreen, Vahle started his own company in 2005.\nGreen Thumb Lawn Care N\u2019 Landscape grew gradually as new hires brought\nadditional skills to the team.\n\n\u201cWe started out focusing on mowing and fertilizing, and as I hired more people\nand expanded my workforce, I essentially expanded my services,\u201d Vahle says.\n\u201cHiring good people who knew more than I did was a huge benefit that allowed\nme to grow.\u201d\n\nAlthough this inadvertent approach to growth got the company to the $1 million\nmark, Vahle knew it wasn\u2019t sustainable. To get to the next level of success,\nVahle went the franchise route.\n\n### The power of online reviews\n\nGreen Thumb Lawn Care N\u2019 Landscape has accumulated over 150 online reviews,\naveraging a solid 4-star rating. Owner Jason Vahle says these votes of\nconfidence from satisfied customers help accelerate the company\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cMore and more, people are researching your company to find out your online\nreputation,\u201d Vahle says. \u201cOnline reviews are hugely important, so on every\nestimate and every interaction we have with a customer via email or mailed\nstatement, we ask for a review.\u201d\n\nBut a generic request on a document isn\u2019t nearly as compelling as a personal\nrequest from the crew member who\u2019s serving the customer. That\u2019s why Vahle\ncharges his employees with generating their own feedback, offering a small\ncash bonus any time a positive review mentions someone by name.\n\n\u201cEvery guy knows that if they get a four- or five-star review online that\nmentions them by name, the next day I show up at the shop and hand them $50,\u201d\nVahle says. \u201cWhen a customer is telling them they\u2019re doing a great job,\nthere\u2019s no better time to ask, \u2018Would you mind going online and giving me a\nreview, please?\u2019\u201d\n\nOne employee earned $350 from this incentive just during the first half of the\nyear. Others might only get the bonus once a quarter. But Vahle says any time\nhe hands out the cash, it encourages more employees to muster up the courage\nto ask for reviews.\n\n\u201cShowing up in front of everybody to hand someone $50 for something that\n(didn\u2019t require much effort) usually generates a lot of interest,\u201d he says.\n\n#### Strategic growth.\n\nVahle discovered several ingredients that were missing from Green Thumb\u2019s\ngrowth formula \u2013 like business plans, budgets and balance sheets. Learning how\nto understand these business fundamentals helped him improve both sides of the\nbusiness.\n\nHe learned to slow down and look at data to make decisions, rather than just\ngoing with what I think is a good decision. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a \u2018fly by the\nseat of our pants\u2019 approach to a more concerted effort. As a result, we\u2019ve had\nmore structured growth,\u201d he says.\n\nVahle began leveraging data to make more strategic decisions. Since his crews\nuse software that routes them to jobsites and tracks the time and cost\nassociated with each project, he had plenty of data to evaluate. Every winter,\nhe audits this info to assess the company\u2019s performance and identify the\nhighest-profit projects and accounts.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t just look at the numbers. He also discusses trends with his\nteam to get a clearer picture of what\u2019s happening behind the data.\n\n\u201cI talk to my guys and ask them, \u2018Why is Mrs. Smith\u2019s property taking twice as\nlong as it did a year ago?\u2019 Maybe she had a new pool put in and they have to\npush-mow and edge around it now,\u201d Vahle says. \u201cI also sit down with my wife\n(Laura), who runs the office, and talk to her about it. If that customer is\ncalling in with concerns every week, then we take that into account. If\ncustomers take a long time to pay, that\u2019s just a headache we don\u2019t need to put\nup with. We\u2019re busy, and that offers us the luxury of being picky.\u201d\n\nUsing this data, combined with input from his field crews and office staff,\nVahle determines which projects actually move the company forward \u2013 and which\nones hold it back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve slowly filtered out things that don\u2019t make us profitable and don\u2019t keep\nus consistent,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough mowing is great for recurring revenue,\nwe\u2019ve curtailed how much maintenance we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019ve explored more\nservices on the hardscape and landscape construction side. That\u2019s helped\nstrategically grow the company.\u201d\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/20180612_125103_fmt.png)\n\n#### Shared resources.\n\nWhen Vahle opened his franchise, he reassured customers that: \u201cIt\u2019s the same\nguys, just wearing different uniforms and driving different trucks. You\u2019re\nstill calling the same office, dealing with the same people.\u201d\n\nGreen Thumb continued to offer lawn and landscape maintenance as well as\nconstruction of outdoor living areas, patios and retaining walls, while his\nfranchise handles the chemical applications for fertilization, weed control,\ntree and shrub care and pest control.\n\nGreen Thumb has about 17 people in the field, and the franchise side of the\nbusiness has four lawn technicians and one sales manager. Laura manages the\nback-office for both companies, with a support staff of two full-time and two\npart-time employees. While each company employs its own crews, there is some\ncrossover, which benefits both sides.\n\nGreen Thumb doesn\u2019t start its season as early as his franchise; they start at\nthe beginning of April, so it gives Green Thumb crews time to help on the\nSpring-Green side. \u201cLawn care is only 40-42 weeks out of the year, so the\nSpring-Green guys cross over into Green Thumb, helping out with leaf clean-\nups, snow removal or retaining walls in the wintertime after our H-2B labor\nleaves,\u201d Vahle says.\n\nThe companies also share clients, regularly subbing out work to each other to\noffer customers a seamless full-service offering.\n\n\u201cA lot of customers on the Green Thumb side are full maintenance; they have\ntheir services built into a seasonal contract,\u201d Vahle explains. \u201cIn doing\nthat, Spring-Green actually subcontracts Green Thumb to do the additional work\nor vice versa, depending which side the customer originated from. That allows\nus to keep the invoicing streamlined and consistent.\u201d\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/20180926_111447_fmt.png)\n\nWith almost 100 franchise locations across the country, Spring-Green offers\nnational buying power and marketing muscle that Vahle couldn\u2019t generate on his\nown.\n\n\u201cSpring-Green isn\u2019t just finding me lawn care customers, because people who\nget their lawns treated also get other services done. Being able to cross-\nmarket those customers without paying additional money is a big benefit,\u201d\nVahle says. \u201cAnd we do it both ways; as Green Thumb acquires a mowing\ncustomer, (we recommend that they get) fertilization as well to give them the\nbest results possible.\u201d\n\nBy setting up each business to focus on its own niche, Vahle leverages both\nteams\u2019 strengths to grow client relationships.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re first starting out, you\u2019ll take whatever work you can get, but\nsometimes that\u2019s not the best work for you,\u201d Vahle says. \u201cAs I grow bigger, I\nkeep coming back to the advice that was given to me early on: Find a niche.\nThat allows you to really be strategic about picking your clients and finding\nprojects that work well for your company.\u201d\n\nThe author is a freelance writer based in Cleveland.\n\n# Advancements in erosion control\n\n### Features - Erosion\n\nBetter versatility and more power are a couple of improvements erosion control\nmanufacturers have invested in for their equipment.\n\n[Subscribe](/subscribe/)\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\n  \n\n[ Catherine Meany ](/author/11354)\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/IMG_2113_fmt.png)\n\nPhotos courtesy of Express Blower\n\nYears ago, the EPA mandated that any groundbreaking over an acre requires some\nsort of erosion control measure be put in place. That\u2019s when Express Blower in\nEugene, Ore., really came into the picture, says Express Blower Marketing\nManager Carla Severe.\n\n\u201cWe have been doing erosion control for over 20 years, and it\u2019s just keeping\nup with what the environmental regulations are,\u201d Severe says.\n\nKeeping up with those regulations sometimes leads to user-side improvements as\nwell. As the deadline to conform to Tier 4 final approached, engineers at FINN\nCorporation, Express Blower\u2019s sister company in Fairfield, Ohio, made a number\nof changes to the technologies in their machines including hydrostatics. Those\nchanges resulted in an immediate response from the control systems where\npreviously there had been a lag behind, says Matt Hoffman, vice president of\nmarketing and sales at FINN Corporation.\n\n\u201cTechnological leaps and changes are going on because of the industry\nrequirements. Contractors and manufacturers alike are demanding more advanced\nmachines,\u201d Hoffman says.\n\nWhile many changes in equipment are due to adapting to government regulations\nlike Tier 4, other equipment advancements are driven by the customer. In fact,\nFINN Corporation held small focus groups to find out what\u2019s important to the\npeople buying their machines, Hoffman says.\n\n\u201cWe took all of that feedback and put together our product plan so we could\ncheck all the boxes of everything everybody was asking for. We did use a lot\nof feedback specifically from contractors so we could capture the things that\nthey thought were needed in the market,\u201d he says.\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/fog_shot_fmt.png)Government\nregulations forced them, but changes to equipment are proving helpful for\ncontractors.\n\n#### Strange and Curious Places.\n\nOne of the areas of importance identified through those focus groups was a\nneed for longer spray distances. As cities are becoming more populated, people\nare getting creative about where they are building homes and roadways. More\nprojects are being built on hillsides and in other challenging areas that\nrequire further spray distances to put down erosion control measures. This,\ncoupled with an increase in forest fires, droughts and flooding, are forcing\npeople to be cognizant of erosion control principles, and that\u2019s making them\ndo some \u201cstrange and curious things,\u201d Hoffman says.\n\nAnother tricky location for erosion control measures are green roofs. Green\nroofs are gaining popularity because they filter all of the gray water that is\ntypically caught on a rooftop before it gets down into the streets and\nwaterways. The challenge is moving all of the necessary materials up there.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, you\u2019d have to take it up a freight elevator or walk it through\na building, which were long and arduous efforts,\u201d Hoffman says. \u201cWe have\ntechnologies in our bark blowers and some of our bigger machines to\neffectively move that material straight up hoses on the sides of the buildings\nup to those rooftops. That\u2019s a significant advantage that can reduce labor and\nbe more efficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have customers that have blown a green roof 30-plus stories high, where\nbefore you have to have cranes and wheelbarrows and shut down a street\npractically,\u201d Severe says. \u201cThis has opened up some eyes about how you can do\nit safer and faster.\u201d\n\n#### Versatility.\n\nAnother frequent customer request of manufacturers is the ability to process\ndifferent materials through the machines. There are dozens of products that\ncan be used together for effective erosion control, from geotextiles to straw\nblankets, and hydroseeding to silk fences. FINN equipment offers improved\npumping technologies to support those different materials, Hoffman says.\n\n\u201cWe have found through hundreds of thousands of gallons of testing that a\ncentrifugal pump is by far the most efficient and effective design with the\nwide variety of materials that are processed,\u201d he says. \u201cOn one of our\nmachines, we even have the ability for someone to choose between the two types\nof pump technologies, the other being vortex.\u201d\n\n> \u201cTechnological leaps and changes are going on because of the industry\n> requirements.\u201d Matt Hoffman, VP of marketing at FINN Corporation\n\n#### Labor Savings.\n\nAs the industry struggles with finding enough workers and keeping costs down,\nequipment manufacturers must focus on products that can make contractors more\nefficient to reduce their costs and reliance on labor, Hoffman says.\n\n\u201cThe speed and efficiency of how you mix and spray is important. We\u2019ve\nintroduced some technologies that have helped us reduce processing time in the\nmixing system of the large tank hydroseeder.\u201d\n\nThe system, called the Integrinder, has shredding and integrated within the\ntank, and a basket catches this material and shreds it before it gets into the\nslurry mixture. Old technologies would grind above the tank, which was at best\ninefficient and at worst dangerous. The Integrinder also features a water\ncurtain that the materials pass through within the tank. This mitigates\nairborne dust and protects workers, Hoffman says.\n\nEven if a contractor\u2019s fleet is stocked with the latest equipment, if they\naren\u2019t trained up properly, they won\u2019t get the best results. Hoffman\nencourages contractors to seek out reputable manufacturers who have\nestablished themselves as leaders and who are Certified Professionals in\nErosion & Sediment Control.\n\n\u201cSeek out people that can help you when you have questions. We see companies\nwho want to get into the industry quickly to see if they can turn a buck, but\nthey haven\u2019t really designed and vetted that product so that it\u2019s effective\nfor that application,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to work with companies that have an\nunderstanding of the environment and of what\u2019s required to be successful.\u201d\n\n# Awesome add-on\n\n### Features - 2020 Design/Build Report\n\nILT Vignocchi had to work through flooding and plant issues to make the\nlandscape thrive after a house addition.\n\n[Subscribe](/subscribe/)\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\n  \n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/WINNETKA_PROJECT__BEFORE_1_CMYK_fmt.png)\n\nPhotos courtesy of ILT Vignocchi\n\nA necessary house addition forced a rethink of a stunning 30-year-old\nlandscape. Many new elements were added along with the resolution of\nsubstantial water issues.\n\nThe project was designed and installed by ILT Vignocchi in Wauconda, Illinois\nand it took a year to complete. It won the Judges\u2019 Award during the Illinois\nLandscape Contractor Association\u2019s 2020 iLandscape show. The Judges\u2019 Award is\nthe best project among all entries as chosen by the judges.\n\nPart of the property is in the 100-year floodplain. Due to this, the property\nwould consistently hold or take on water. It would always take a while for the\nwater table level to recede back to normal levels after a heavy rain. This\nwater fluctuation and slow draining affected the plant material over time.\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/A_fmt.png)\n\n\u201cShrubs and perennials showed signs of stress and trying to find the correct\nbalance of water-loving plants and plants that preferred drier conditions\n(which could happen mid-summer) always become a challenge,\u201d says Aaron Zych,\nlandscape architect and vice president at ILT Vignocchi.\n\n\u201cThat is the reason we installed a large gravel \u2018cistern\u2019 under the lawn\npanel, to drain the water away from all the new plants while having a place to\nstore all the collected water. This, along with using raised planting beds,\nprovided a home for many of the perennials that was more conducive to long\nterm health. Everything has been flourishing since the revisions.\u201d\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/D_CMYK_fmt.png)\n\nNew elements added to the property include a pool (which reused the existing\nirregular bluestone on the old patio for the decking), a brick privacy wall,\nthe plantings, a formal lawn panel (with the underground storage capacity for\nstorm water), garden paths, water features, a pond, an elevated sitting garden\nand a dinning and cocktail patio which all seamlessly blend together to create\na stunning rear yard.\n\nDuring construction, the extremely prized roses of the client had to be\ntransplanted, cared for off-site for months, and then replanted.\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/B_CMYK_fmt.png)\n\n\u201cRoses do not transplant great, so we had to take extra care when removing\nthem,\u201d Zych says. \u201cWe took them all to our off-site greenhouses, and cared for\nthem during the construction process. When construction was finished the roses\nwere replanted in their new raised garden bed.\u201d Access to the property was\nanother issue.\n\n\u201cThere were many large mature trees we had to work around so we didn\u2019t lose\nthem,\u201d he says. \u201cThis meant that bringing in large machinery to help with this\nproject was not an option. Small machines or hand work had to be done to make\nthis project possible.\u201d\n\n## Lawn & Landscape Radio Network\n\n[![Talking Tech with a C.T.O.](/fileuploads/image/2020/02/07/LLRN\n736x414_nologo_justin.jpg?w=736&h=414&mode=crop&scale=both)](/mayberry-\ntechnology-robotic.aspx)\n\n### [Talking Tech with a C.T.O.](/mayberry-technology-robotic.aspx)\n\n## Videos\n\n[![Episode Two: Lawn & Pest Solutions](/fileuploads/image/2020/03/26/TAT 2020\nEpisode 2_0.jpg?w=736&h=414&mode=crop&scale=both)](/episode-two-lawn-and-pest-\nsolutions.aspx)\n\n### [Episode Two: Lawn & Pest Solutions](/episode-two-lawn-and-pest-\nsolutions.aspx)\n\n[![Lawn & Landscape](/FileUploads/image/logos/site-logos/ll.png)](/)\n\n##\n\n  * [ ____ ](https://www.facebook.com/lawnandlandscape)\n  * [ ____ ](https://twitter.com/lawnlandscape)\n  * [ ____ ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lawn-landscape-magazine)\n  * [ ____ ](https://instagram.com/lawnlandscape/)\n\n  * [Golf Course Industry](https://www.golfcourseindustry.com)\n  * [Greenhouse Management](https://www.greenhousemag.com)\n  * [Nursery Management](https://www.nurserymag.com/)\n  * [Garden Center](https://www.gardencentermag.com)\n  * [Snow Magazine](https://www.snowmagazineonline.com)\n  * [PCT Magazine](https://www.pctonline.com)\n  * [CBT Magazine](https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com)\n  * [Contact Us](/ContactUs.aspx)\n  * [Subscribe](/subscribe)\n  * [Home](/)\n  * [RSS](/rss)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/)\n  * [Terms of Use](/terms-of-use/)\n  * (C) 2020 GIE Media, Inc.

can re-employ people who were made redundant or left their\norganisations after 28 February 2020 and make a claim for their wages, the\ngovernment has clarified in its updated furlough scheme guidance.**\n\n## Furlough\n\n**[Furlough in action: BA, M&S, Disney, McAlpine and\nmore](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/furlough-coronavirus-british-airways-\nmarks-spencer-disney-and-more/)**\n\n**[What you need to know about\nfurlough](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-\ncoronavirus-job-retention-scheme/)**\n\nAlthough staff who were not on the payroll after 28 February are not eligible\nfor furlough pay, the update to the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme guidance\nnotes that people who were furloughed after starting a new job after this date\ncan ask their previous employer to re-employ them in order for them to receive\n80% of their former salary which the organisation can claim back from the\ngovernment.\n\nIt has also been clarified that employees can start a new job for another\nemployer while on furlough, but only if contractually allowed by the\norganisation that has put them on furlough.\n\nStaff may be furloughed multiple times; for example, if they are furloughed\nfor a minimum of three weeks, they may return to work for a period and then be\nplaced on another furlough period of at least three weeks.\n\nEmployers can also reclaim 80% of \u201ccompulsory\u201d commission back from HMRC, as\nwell as basic salary. However, this is likely to relate to commission earned\nbefore the employee went on furlough, as they are not allowed to work under\nthe scheme.\n\nDiane Gilhooley, global head of employment, labour and pensions at law firm\nEversheds Sutherland, said the scheme now started to look like an income\nprotection scheme rather than a redundancy avoidance scheme.\n\n\u201cThe Job Retention Scheme was originally announced with the aim of helping\nemployers severely affected by the pandemic to preserve jobs and avoid\nredundancies. The updated guidance restates the original purpose, but then\nextends the scheme to situations falling outside this purpose,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSome employers are already uncertain about whether they can or should be\nusing the scheme and these mixed messages about the purpose of the scheme may\nadd to that confusion. Employers do not have to rehire and many will conclude\nthat the spirit of the scheme, the use of public money and the complexities\nthat can arise on a rehiring, mean it is not in their interests to do so.\u201d\n\nGilhooley was disappointed that the updated guidance did not expressly clarify\nwhether holidays can be taken during furlough leave without jeopardising the\nclaim for reimbursement of wages.\n\n\u201cHowever, the updated guidance does confirm that employees can be rotated\non/off furlough and indicate that employers will be able to bring workers off\nfurlough leave for a period of annual leave and then return them to furlough\nleave. This will help employers to avoid an accumulation of untaken leave\nwhich would then have to be taken when normal working can resume,\u201d she added.\n\n## Latest HR job opportunities on Personnel

If a company's\nprinciples are just words on an outdated webpage, this stress could crack that\nworkforce. But if principles exist in a real culture, that's where people come\ntogether and thrive through hardship,\" says Taylor.\n\n**Industries**  \nIn the physical industries like construction, manufacturing and\ntransportation, 72 per cent of workers report an inability to meet basic\nfinancial needs in a month or less, compared to 62 per cent of service\nindustry workers, such as accommodation, education, food and retail.\n\nMeanwhile, only 38 per cent of workers in knowledge industries, including\nfinance, insurance, law, research, government and others anticipate financial\ndifficulties.\n\nIn Ontario, [19 per cent of households are behind on payments with credit\ncards, utilities and cellphone bills](https://www.hrreporter.com/focus-\nareas/payroll/nearly-1-in-5-canadians-behind-on-financial-payments-\nsurvey/327984), found a recent survey.

Nevius, J.D.**  \n\n  \n\nRelated\n\nTOPICS\n\n  * [COVID-19](/topics/topic-results.jofa.covid-19.html)\n    * [Advocacy & Tax Relief](/topics/topic-results.jofa.covid-19.advocacy-and-tax-relief.html)\n  * [Tax](/topics/topic-results.jofa.tax.html)\n    * [Employee Benefits](/topics/topic-results.jofa.tax.employee-benefits.html)\n\nThe coronavirus relief bill signed by President Donald Trump late Wednesday\ncontains, among its many provisions, several tax credits for employers who\nprovide paid sick leave or family or medical leave for their employees who\nmiss work for various coronavirus-related reasons. The Families First\nCoronavirus Response Act, [H.R.\n6201](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr6201/BILLS-116hr6201enr.pdf),\npassed the House of Representatives on Monday by unanimous consent and passed\nthe Senate Wednesday by a vote of 90\u20138.\n\nHere is a look at its tax credit provisions.\n\n## Payroll tax credit for required paid family leave\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the bill provides an employer payroll tax\ncredit that equals 100% of the qualified family leave wages paid by the\nemployer under the portion of the bill known as the Emergency Family and\nMedical Leave Expansion Act (Division C of the bill). The Emergency Family and\nMedical Leave Expansion Act requires employers with fewer than 500 employees\nto provide public health emergency leave under the Family and Medical Leave\nAct (FMLA), P.L. 103-3, when an employee is unable to work or telework due to\na need for leave to care for a son or daughter under age 18 because the school\nor place of care has been closed, or the child care provider is unavailable,\ndue to a public health emergency related to COVID-19. (Employers with fewer\nthan 50 employees can be exempted from the requirement.)\n\nThe credit is available for eligible wages paid during a period that begins on\na date starting on a date within 15 days of enactment (to be designated by\nTreasury) and through Dec. 31, 2020. The credit would apply against the\nemployer portion of Sec. 3111(a) old age, survivors, and disability insurance\n(OASDI) taxes or Sec. 3221(a) Tier 1 Railroad Retirement Act excise taxes. The\ncredit is generally available for up to $200 in wages for each day an employee\nreceives qualified family leave wages. A maximum of $10,000 in wages per\nemployee would be eligible for the credit. The amount of the credit is\nincreased by the amount of the Sec. 3111(b) Medicare tax imposed on the\nqualified family leave wages for which credit is allowed.\n\nIf an employer claims the credit, the employer\u2019s gross income will be\nincreased by the amount of the credit (meaning the credit is not taken into\naccount for purposes of determining any amount allowable as a payroll tax\ndeduction, deduction for qualified family leave wages, or deduction for health\nplan expenses), and no credit will be allowed for wages for which a Sec. 45S\nfamily and medical leave credit is claimed. The credit would not apply to the\nfederal government, the government of any state or any subdivision of a state,\nor any agencies or instrumentalities of these entities. Employers also could\nelect not to apply the new provision for any calendar quarter.\n\nThe credit would not apply to the U.S. government, the government of any state\nor any subdivision of a state, or any agencies or instrumentalities of the\nforegoing. Employers can elect not to apply the new provision for any calendar\nquarter.\n\n**Self-employed individuals:** Eligible self-employed individuals would be\neligible for a refundable credit against income tax for qualified family leave\nequivalent amounts. An eligible self-employed individual is an individual who\nregularly carries on any trade or business (as defined in Sec. 1402) and would\nbe entitled to receive paid leave under the Emergency Family and Medical Leave\nExpansion Act if the individual were an employee.\n\nWages paid under the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act are not\nconsidered wages for purposes of the Sec. 3111(a) OASDI tax or the Sec.\n3221(a) Railroad Retirement Act excise taxes.\n\n## Payroll tax credit for required paid sick leave\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the bill provides an employer payroll tax\ncredit that equals 100% of the qualified sick leave wages paid by the employer\nunder the portion of the bill known as the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act\n(Division E of the bill). The Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act requires employers\nwith fewer than 500 employees to provide up to 80 hours of paid sick time\nthrough the end of this year if the employee is unable to work due to being\nquarantined or self-quarantined or having COVID-19 or because the employee is\ncaring for someone who is quarantined or self-quarantined or has COVID-19 or\nif the employee is caring for children whose school has been closed because of\nCOVID-19 precautions. (Employers with fewer than 50 employees can be exempted\nfrom the requirement.)\n\nThe credit is effective for sick leave wages paid starting on a date within 15\ndays of enactment (to be designated by Treasury) and through Dec. 31, 2020.\nThe credit will apply against Sec. 3111(a) OASDI taxes or Sec. 3221(a) Tier 1\nRailroad Retirement Act excise taxes. The credit is generally available for up\nto $511 in wages (for workers who are quarantined or self-quarantined or who\nhave COVID-19) and wages of up to $200 for other workers for each day an\nemployee receives qualified sick leave pay. The credit would be available for\nup to 10 days per calendar quarter. The amount of the credit is increased by\nthe amount of the Sec. 3111(b) Medicare tax imposed on the qualified sick\nleave wages for which credit is allowed.\n\nTo prevent double benefits, employers\u2019 gross income will be increased by the\namount of the credit (meaning the credit is not taken into account for\npurposes of determining any amount allowable as a payroll tax deduction,\ndeduction for qualified sick leave wages, or deduction for health plan\nexpenses), and no credit will be allowed for wages for which a Sec. 45S family\nand medical leave credit is claimed. The credit would not apply to the federal\ngovernment, the government of any state or any subdivision of a state, or any\nagencies or instrumentalities of these entities. Employers also could elect\nnot to apply the new provision for any calendar quarter.\n\nThe credit can be increased by certain qualified health plan expenses of the\nemployer that are allocable to qualified sick leave wages for which the credit\nis allowed.\n\n**Self-employed individuals: __** The bill also provides eligible self-\nemployed taxpayers with a refundable credit against income tax for qualified\nsick leave equivalent amounts. An eligible self-employed individual is an\nindividual who regularly carries on any trade or business (as defined in Sec.\n1402) and would be entitled to receive paid leave under the Emergency Paid\nSick Leave Act if the individual were an employee.\n\nWages paid under the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act are not considered wages\nfor purposes of the Sec. 3111(a) OASDI tax or the Sec. 3221(a) Railroad\nRetirement Act excise taxes.\n\n_For more news and reporting on the coronavirus and how CPAs can handle\nchallenges related to the outbreak, visit the_ JofA _\u2019s_[ _coronavirus\nresources page_](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/info/coronavirus-\nresources-for-cpas.html) _._\n\n_\u2014 **Alistair M.

The reality is that almost everyone is struggling to get\nthrough this unanticipated and unprecedented situation. Many businesses are\nfaced with a situation where they cannot afford to pay their staff but they\nmay not have the right to lay them off temporarily; they are stuck between the\nproverbial rock and hard place, and something has got to give.\n\nAll levels of government have announced various measures in order to assist\nbusinesses, individuals, and families during the pandemic. Recently, there\nhave been some significant developments, including the Canada Emergency Wage\nSubsidy and the Work-Sharing Program. The Wage Subsidy is a federal program\noffering a subsidy of up to 75 per cent of wages and may prevent or end a\nsignificant number of layoffs if it can be implemented quickly. We know that\nmany of our clients believe that it will change their situation significantly.\n\nThe purpose of this blog post is to provide an overview of some of the key\nsupports that are currently available in order to help employers avoid layoffs\nand help employees keep their jobs. Given that the information is constantly\nbeing updated, it can be difficult to keep up with the changes, and we\nencourage readers to access our firm's running blog on COVID-19 workplace\nissues on a regular basis to get the latest information.\n\n**Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy**\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau recently announced that qualifying businesses\ncould receive a wage subsidy of up to 75 per cent in order to help them to\nkeep and return workers to the payroll. The key details are outlined below,\nalthough there will be further updates in the coming days.\n\n**Who?** The temporary wage subsidy is available to employers of all sizes and\nacross all sectors of the economy, including non-profit organizations and\nregistered charities. However, public sector entities are excluded.\n\nIn order to be eligible, the employer has to show that the company's sales\nhave decreased by at least 30 per cent on a monthly basis when compared with\nthe same month in the prior year (for example, if the wage subsidy is for\nApril 2020, then the sales for April 2020 have to be at least 30 per cent less\nthan April 2019). Refer to [the section on Eligible\nPeriods](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-\nplan/wage-subsidy.html) for further details. It sounds as though there may be\nsome flexibility in the approach to this calculation, and obviously employers\nthat have been in operation for less than a year will have to find a different\nway to satisfy this requirement.\n\nOrganizations that do not qualify for this wage subsidy may qualify for the\npreviously announced wage subsidy of 10 per cent of remuneration paid from\nMarch 18 to before June 20, 2020.\n\n**What?** The temporary wage subsidy will provide up to 75 per cent of gross\nregular wages to a maximum of $847 per week or $58,700 annually. There is no\nlimit on the total amount an employer can claim, as there is no limit on the\nsize of an employer which can benefit from this program.\n\nEligible remuneration may include salary, wages, and other remuneration for\nwhich employers would generally be required to withhold or deduct amounts on\naccount of the employee's income tax obligation. Notably, it does not include\nseverance pay or items such as stock option benefits or the personal use of a\ncorporate vehicle.\n\n**When?** The temporary wage subsidy will apply for or up to 12 weeks,\nretroactive to March 15, 2020 and ending on June 9, 2020 unless it is\nextended. Employers will have to reapply each month for the subsidy.\n\nFunds are expected to be available to be paid to the employer in about six\nweeks from April 1, 2020 (around the middle of May 2020), which is\nsignificantly different from the 10 per cent wage subsidy announced earlier.\n\n**Why?** This program is designed \"to help employers hardest hit by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic to keep and retain workers.\" This wage subsidy aims to\nprevent further job losses, encourage employers to re-hire workers previously\nlaid off as a result of COVID-19, and help better position employers to more\neasily resume business-as-usual following the crisis.\n\nWhile the government has designed the proposed wage subsidy to provide support\nto employers, it was done with the expectation that employers will do their\npart by using the subsidy in a manner that supports the health and well-being\nof their employees.\n\n**How?** Employers can apply online through the CRA portal which will be\navailable soon.\n\nThere have been indications that anyone who abuses the system would face\nsevere penalties, although it remains unclear what the penalties would look\nlike. There have also been indications that businesses must show that they are\ndoing everything they can to pay the remaining 25 per cent, but how this would\nbe applied remains unclear.\n\n**  Interaction with Canada Emergency Response Benefit **\n\nAn employer would not be eligible to claim the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy\nfor remuneration paid to an employee in a week that falls within a four-week\nperiod for which the employee is eligible for the Canada Emergency Response\nBenefit (CERB).\n\nEmployers that are not eligible for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy would\nstill be able to furlough employees who will receive the CERB of up to $2,000\na month. Accordingly, it appears that at any given time, for any specific\nemployee, either the CERB or the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy may be\napplicable, but not both.\n\n**Work-Sharing Program**\n\n**Who?** The Work-Sharing (WS) Program is for eligible employers and employees\nwhere the employer can demonstrate a recent decline in business activity of at\nleast 10 per cent that is directly or indirectly related to the impact of\nCOVID-19, and a temporary decrease of employee hours of work in the range of\n10 to 60 per cent.\n\nThere are multiple eligibility criteria that must be met for both the employer\nand the employees. To be eligible for a WS agreement, a business must:\n\n  * be a year-round business in Canada for at least one year,\n\n  * be a private business, a publicly held company or a not-for-profit organization\n\n  * have at least two employees in the WS unit.\n\nTo be eligible for WS, employees must:\n\n  * be \"core staff\",\n\n  * be eligible to receive EI benefits (see below)\n\n  * agree to reduce their normal working hours by the same percentage and to share the available work.\n\nThe eligibility requirement for WS is the same as for regular employment\ninsurance (EI) benefits, and employees must have 420 to 700 hours of insurable\nemployment during their qualifying period which is the 52 weeks prior to the\nstart of their EI benefit period.\n\nEmployers should consult the detailed eligibility criteria as well as the non-\neligibility criteria to determine whether or not their business or certain\nemployees qualify.\n\n**What?** The WS program provides EI benefits to eligible employees who agree\nto reduce their normal working hours and share the available work while their\nemployer recovers from the impact of COVID-19.\n\nFor most people, the basic rate for calculating EI benefits is 55 per cent of\ntheir average insurable weekly earnings, up to a maximum amount. As of Jan. 1,\n2020, the maximum yearly insurable earnings amount is $54,200. This means that\nthe employee can receive a maximum amount of $573 per week.\n\n**When?** COVID-19 temporary special measures are effective March 15, 2020 to\nMarch 14, 2021. The temporary special measures extend the qualifying weeks for\nthe WS program from 38 weeks to 76 weeks. The minimum duration is six weeks.\n\nAn application for a WS agreement must be submitted a minimum of 10 calendar\ndays prior to the requested start date, which is a significantly shortened\nperiod from the pre-COVID-19 30-day rule. All agreements must begin on a\nSunday.\n\nEmployees do not have to serve a waiting period for WS benefits. The EI\nbenefits are processed through the EI payment system.\n\n**Why?** The WS program is intended to help employers and employees avoid\nlayoffs when there is a temporary decrease in business activity beyond the\ncontrol of the employer. In particular, the WS program allows employers to\nretain talent, and allows employees to keep their jobs and maintain their job\nskills.\n\n**How?**  If you are applying for a new agreement, you must submit the\napplication 10 calendar days prior to the requested start date. Applications\ncan be sent to Service Canada by email at: [ESDC.ON.WS-\nTP.ON.EDSC@servicecanada.gc.ca](mailto:ESDC.ON.WS-\nTP.ON.EDSC@servicecanada.gc.ca).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn the coming days, there will be further information regarding the various\ngovernment measures to support employers and employees. We will continue to\nmonitor the situation and encourage you to do the same. The bottom line is\nthat this situation was entirely unexpected and everyone is scrambling to\nadapt to it - businesses, individuals, and governments alike. Things are\nchanging rapidly; for example, many layoffs that seemed to be inevitable a\nweek ago have now been cancelled or at least postponed while everyone assesses\nthe options for support that are available.\n\nToo many businesses and individuals are making decisions without understanding\nthe legal implications. Know your rights so that every decision is an informed\none. Stay safe, and stay informed.\n\n### Latest stories\n\n  * [This is all very frustrating, but is it frustration of contract?](/opinion/canadian-hr-law/this-is-all-very-frustrating-but-is-it-frustration-of-contract/328138)\n  * [Temporary layoffs not always allowed](/opinion/canadian-hr-law/temporary-layoffs-not-always-allowed/327849)\n  * [You can't wear that](/opinion/canadian-hr-law/you-cant-wear-that/327542)\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nThe Canadian HR Newswire is a FREE weekly newsletter that keeps you up to date\non news, opinion and analysis about the field of human resources.

meeting](https://mk0knowtechie1qof48y.kinstacdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/product-reviews-office-meeting.jpg)\n\nImage: Unsplash\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n[\n\n  * __\n](mailto:?subject=Why you should use apps to manage your employees data and\npayroll&BODY=I found this article interesting and thought of sharing it with\nyou. Check it out: https://knowtechie.com/why-you-should-use-apps-to-manage-\nyour-employees-data-and-payroll/)\n\n  * __\n\nToday, the world is becoming digital, and to stay up-to-date and relevant,\nyour company\u2019s HR team needs to keep up with the best technological\nadvancements in the market. After all, managing employee data and payroll can\nbe tedious. But with the help of technology, you can make the process a lot\neasier and smoother.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to streamline your HR processes, below are the reasons why\nyou use apps to handle your employee data and payroll efficiently:\n\n### **Lower Operational Costs**\n\nIn this digital world, using some apps can be beneficial for your company,\nespecially when it comes to the reduction of operating expenses. Unlike the\nold-fashioned way of keeping employee data and preparing payroll, the use of\napp technology can lower the resources required for the process.\n\nWith some applications in place, you can ensure a payroll run in just a few\nclicks, and as a result, you\u2019re able to reduce the need for an efficient\nworkforce that can manage the process. Take note that the more you reduce the\noperational necessities, the more you can save a lot of money for your\nbusiness.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re looking for the best app for your employee data and payroll\nneeds, many companies offer a variety of advanced HR and accounting software\nthat will work best for your business needs. To gather more information, you\ncan check this [official website](https://www.waveapps.com/payroll).\n\n### **Take Advantage Of Information Security**\n\nAs an employer, you never want to compromise your employee information and get\nit into the wrong hands. Luckily, with the advent of some reliable HR\napplications these days, you can [protect all sensitive company information\nagainst unauthorized access](https://knowtechie.com/how-to-prevent-your-data-\nfrom-breaching-tips-for-businesses/).\n\nFor instance, you can get the most out of the apps\u2019 security features to make\nsure all data are safe and secure from unwanted eyes. These features can\ninclude touch or face ID, dual authentication, and many more. By using some\napps, your company can take the necessary precautions to keep all employee\ndata highly confidential and private.\n\n### **Easy To Use**\n\nAnother reason why you should use the app technology for managing employee\npayroll and data is the ease of use that it provides to your HR team.\nTypically, most payroll applications or software comes with several features\nthat can integrate all aspects of your employee data that can easily be used\nby your staff.\n\nWith the help of these [apps](/tag/apps), you can incorporate all necessary\ninputs for payrolls such as attendance data, salary structure, required\nstatutory deductions, bank details, and many more in just one platform. From\nthere, employee payroll can be processed with a few clicks. Instead of\nmanually encoding the attendance data and computing the deductions, the\nsoftware will do everything for you from payroll run to payslip generation and\nsalary disbursement.\n\n### **Can Be Customized Based On Your Payroll Needs**\n\nUsing apps for employee data and payroll management comes with customization.\nIn addition to ease of use, the app technology is considered customizable to\nyour payroll needs. This means that despite the changing employment laws and\nregulations in your state, the software can be set up in a way that it caters\nto all of these changes without disrupting the [usual payroll\nprocess](https://www.wikihow.com/Process-Payroll).\n\nTherefore, if you want an application that can accommodate different payroll\nschedules and reporting requirements, always look for a flexible software that\ncan help your business grow over time.\n\n### **Allows You To Conduct Fast And Easy Payroll Reconciliation**\n\nAs a business owner, you also need to keep accurate records of employee\nsalaries, withholdings, and other useful information for tax purposes. This\nprocess is usually called payroll reconciliation. And just like other finance-\nrelated tasks, it\u2019s an essential part of running a business; thereby, it needs\nto be done efficiently.\n\nThankfully, most common apps for employee data and payroll management provide\npayroll reconciliation tools. With them in place, it\u2019s easy to check and\ncompare the previous and current payroll records to determine discrepancies,\nif there\u2019s any. As a result, you can get complete peace of mind, knowing that\nno errors can affect the payroll.\n\n### **Enjoy Accessibility For All**\n\nUsing apps for payroll can provide your staff with easy access to their own\nrecords. Whether they want to check their attendance data, update their\npersonal information, and banking details, they can do all of these things\nwith ease and without trouble.\n\nAnd due to this accessibility, your employees can instantly find the answers\nto their queries, and in turn, it saves your HR team time and effort in\ndealing with these matters.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWith more [businesses](/tag/business) and companies that are becoming tech-\nsavvy, it\u2019s about time to change the way you handle employee data and payroll.\nThanks to the arrival of various HR and accounting apps or software, you no\nlonger have to deal with the manual and tedious payroll tasks.\n\nSo, if you want the best for your business, keep these reasons in mind, and\nyou\u2019ll be more confident to use apps to manage your employee data and payroll.\n\n_Have any thoughts on this?

Paychex, Inc., a\nprovider of HR, payroll, benefits, and insurance solutions, aims to help the\nbusiness owners understand the meaning of the legislation, both for their\nbusiness and employees, as well as offers support and resources.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the health and safety concerns this crisis presents, it will\nhave a financial impact on businesses and people across the nation. The\nFamilies First Coronavirus Response Act will provide much-needed relief,\u201d said\nMartin Mucci, Paychex president, and CEO. \u201cWhile we\u2019re awaiting specific\ndetails on the mechanics of the Act\u2019s implementation,\n[Paychex](http://paychex.com) will continue to support our customers\nthroughout this process, ensuring their payroll, HR, and insurance needs are\nmet and providing the education and resources to help navigate the act\u2019s many\nprovisions.\u201d\n\n**HR News:**[Centrical Comes up With Remote Work Solution to Aid Business\nContinuity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/employee-engagement/centrical-\ncomes-up-with-remote-work-solution-to-aid-business-continuity/)\n\nIn general, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act dedicates tens of\nbillions of dollars for paid sick and family leave, unemployment insurance,\nfree COVID-19 testing, and other measures to help Americans affected by the\ncrisis. The final bill, which takes effect for most covered employers no later\nthan 15 days after enactment and sunsets on December 31, 2020, contains\nnumerous provisions affecting businesses and individuals.\n\n### **Here is an overview of the key elements, which generally apply to\nprivate employers with fewer than 500 employees:**\n\n  * **Emergency Family Medical Leave (FML) Expansion Act:** Temporarily expands the provisions under the Federal Family and Medical Leave Act specifically to address COVID-19-related absences. \n    * Eligible employees, who have worked for their employer for 30 days, who qualify for leave under the expanded reasons for leave, would be paid by their employer after the first 10 days of leave at a rate of no less than two-thirds of their current rate of pay.\n    * There is a cap of $200 per day, up to a maximum of $10,000, for up to 12 weeks in the benefit year.\n    * Employees are permitted to take but employers cannot require the use of any other paid time off during their leave.\n    * Employees covered under a multi-employer bargaining agreement are addressed separately in the legislation.\n    * Some exemptions apply for employers of health care workers.  \n\n  * **Payroll Credit for Required Paid Family Leave:** This refundable tax credit is designed to reimburse 100 percent of wages paid by the employer under the new Emergency FML expansion for each calendar quarter. \n    * The tax credit is allowed against the employer portion of the tax-imposed Social Security rate of 6.2 percent and the Medicare rate of 1.45 percent.\n    * The amount is capped for each employee at $200 per day and $10,000 for all calendar quarters.\n    * If the credit exceeds the employer\u2019s total liability of the employer portion of Social Security and Medicare in any calendar quarter, the excess credit is refundable to the employer.\n    * Specific rules apply that prevent a double tax benefit.  \n\n  * **Emergency Paid Sick Leave (PSL) Act:** Employers are required to provide paid sick time, available for immediate use, to each employee requiring such time for specific reasons associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including quarantines, currently seeking a diagnosis due to symptoms, or caring for an individual who is under quarantine or for a child whose school/care is closed due to COVID-19. \n    * Provide up to 80 hours of paid sick leave (PSL) to eligible full-time employees and pro-rate part-time employees paid sick time based on the average number of hours regularly scheduled in a two-week period.\n    * The calculation and caps for compensation vary dependent on the reason for leave with a maximum of $511 per day if the employee is the individual directly impacted and up to $200 per day if it is for the care of someone else. Aggregate caps exist as well.\n    * Employees may not be required to use other available paid time off before using paid sick time under this Act.\n    * Employees covered under a multi-employer bargaining agreement are addressed separately in the legislation.\n    * Some exemptions apply for employers of health care workers.\n    * Employers will be required to post a notice of employee rights; the U.S. Secretary of Labor will provide a model notice within seven days of enactment.\n    * Paid sick time provided under this Act is not preempted by other federal, state, or local law.  \n\n  * **Payroll Credit for Required Paid Sick Leave (PSL):** This refundable tax credit is designed to reimburse 100 percent of wages paid by the employer under the new Emergency PSL for each calendar quarter. \n    * The tax credit is allowed against the employer portion of the tax imposed Social Security rate of 6.2 percent and the Medicare rate of 1.45 percent.\n    * The amount is capped at the maximums of $511 or $200 per day, depending on the reason.\n    * If the credit exceeds the employer\u2019s total liability of the employer portion of Social Security and Medicare in any calendar quarter, the excess credit is refundable to the employer.\n    * Specific rules apply that prevent a double tax benefit.\n\n###  \n**Other General Provisions:**\n\n  * **Emergency Unemployment Insurance Stabilization and Access Act of 2020:** The bill provides $1 billion in emergency grants to states for activities related to facilitating unemployment insurance benefits, under certain conditions. \n    * $500 million will be used to provide immediate additional funding to all states for staffing, technology, systems, and other administrative costs, provided certain requirements are met.\n    * The remaining $500 million would be set aside in reserve for emergency grants to states which experienced at least a 10 percent increase in unemployment. Those states would be eligible to receive an additional grant if certain conditions are met.\n    * The U.S. Secretary of Labor will also work with states that want to implement work-sharing programs.  \n\n  * **Coverage of Testing for COVID-19:** Diagnostic testing and provider visits related to COVID-19 testing, including office visits, urgent care visits, and emergency room visits, must be provided without any co-pays, coinsurance, or deductibles. \n    * Additionally, no prior authorizations may be required for testing.\n    * These provisions would apply to any health insurance plans, including individual and group health plans, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n    * Additionally, federal funding will be provided for uninsured individuals to receive reimbursement for COVID-19 testing and related services.\n\n###  \n**How Paychex Can Help**\n\nPaychex, with a dedicated team of experts, is helping business owners and HR\nmanagers understand and implement the provisions of the Families First\nCoronavirus Response Act.\n\nIn addition, [Paychex](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/paychex-enhances-payroll-hr-with-new-solutions/) is committed\nto protecting the health and safety of its employees, while continuing to\nsupport its 670,000 clients through this challenging scenario.

into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover $5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a $250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% say the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\n  \n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, says Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner. (Tinder will be among the presenters at the upcoming [Select HR\nTech](https://www.selecthrtech.com) conference in June.)\n\nTinder says her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n> \u201cYou can get the best product on the market and spend millions of dollars.\n> But if you don't have the right project partner and the right project plan,\n> it's going to fail.\u201d\u2014Bonnie Duncan Tinder, Raven Intel\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe says. In fairness, she notes, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don't have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn't matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder says. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don't have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it's going to fail.\u201d\n\n  \n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, says that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she says, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille says.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explains.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explains. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he adds.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Marcotte-head-\nshot-2019-250x167.jpg)\n\nScot Marcotte\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte says, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte says.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he says, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte says.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n> \u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\n> work together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and\n> people\u2014sense.\u201d\u2014Scot Marcotte, Buck\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears says. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he says.\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/JonathanSears-250x375.jpg)\n\nJonathan Sears\n\nSears says traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder says, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she says. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears says, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he says. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook says, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he says. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook says. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook says HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concludes. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n_To learn more about how to ensure success in your HR-tech projects, register\nfor_[ _Select HR Tech_](https://www.selecthrtech.com/topics) _, the new\nconference from the creators of_ Human Resource Executive\u00ae _and the HR\nTechnology Conference & Exposition\u00ae that debuts June 9-11 in Las Vegas._\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

[CARES\nAct](https://www.investopedia.com/coronavirus-aid-relief-and-economic-\nsecurity-cares-act-4800707) into law, Congress and President Trump have set\ninto motion a massive $2.2 trillion COVID-19 stimulus bill and the largest\nsingle economic rescue plan in the history of the U.S.\n\nAt this point, you likely wonder how much of this and previous coronavirus\nlegislation applies to you and your financial well-being. It turns out these\nlaws impact you in a big way.\n\n##  Phases I, II, and III\n\nThere are three parts to COVID-19 legislation so far, Phases I, II, and III.\n\nPhase I, H.R. 6074, known as the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response\nSupplemental Appropriations Act, 2020, was enacted into law March 6, 2020 and\nprovides $8.3 billion in emergency funding for federal agencies to ensure\nvaccines developed to fight the coronavirus are affordable, that impacted\nsmall businesses can qualify for Small Business Administration\n([SBA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-business-\nadministration.asp)) [Economic Injury Disaster Loans\n(EIDLs)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-\nfinance/091514/expanding-your-small-business-sba-loan.asp), and that Medicare\nrecipients can consult with their providers by telephone or teleconference, if\nnecessary or desired.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nPhase II, H.R. 6201, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, became law\nMarch 18, 2020. This $100 billion package includes provisions for paid sick\nleave, free coronavirus testing, expanded food assistance, additional\nunemployment benefits, and requirements that employers provide additional\nprotection for healthcare workers.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nPhase III, H.R. 758 (116), the CARES Act, signed into law March 27, 2020,\nrepresents the[ largest stimulus bill in the history of the U.S. at $2.2\ntrillion](https://www.investopedia.com/what-s-in-the-usd2-trillion-\ncoronavirus-stimulus-bill-4800882). The legislation provides direct payments\nto individual taxpayers and their dependents, a huge expansion to unemployment\nbenefits, including the self-employed, student loan forbearance, and much\nmore.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n###  Key Takeaways\n\n  * Coronavirus legislation affects your wealth as well as your health.\n  * Legislation falls into three parts - Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III.\n  * These new laws cover everything from the cost of vaccine to small business loans to direct payments to U.S. citizens and more.\n  * Experts as well as members of Congress say more will eventually be needed. Keep checking for updates.\n\n##  Impact on Your Financial Life\n\nTo help you better understand how COVID-19 legislation affects your financial\nwell-being, the list that follows includes provisions that may apply to your\nsituation. Expect the list to change in the days and weeks to come as new\nideas become law. In other words, check back. Here are the key points, tied to\nthe laws they're part of.\n\n##  Free Vaccines (Phase I and III)\n\n(I) H.R. 6074, now Public Law 116-123, provides that \u201cvaccines, therapeutics,\nand diagnostics\u201d funded by this law will be \u201caffordable.\u201d While the definition\nof \u201caffordable\u201d is unclear, there is a commitment on the part of government to\nensure no price gouging when it comes to coronavirus treatment.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n(III) The CARES Act further declares that access to testing and any future\nvaccine will be available \"without cost-sharing.\" In other words, the vaccine\nand testing to find out if you have the coronavirus are free.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Small Business Relief (Phases I and III)\n\n(I) Phase I law establishes a $20,000,000 \u201cDisaster Loans Program Account\u201d to\nprovide money to small business owners in the form of low-cost [SBA\nloans](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-\nfinance/091514/expanding-your-small-business-sba-loan.asp) to help overcome\nthe economic impact of COVID-19 on their business. Needless to say, this\naffects employees as well, since a closed business has no employees.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n(III) Phase III offers $349 billion to provide tax credits to small businesses\nand allows them to defer paying payroll taxes so they can continue paying\nemployees. Businesses with fewer than 500 employees can receive a \u201cSmall\nBusiness Interruption Loan\u201d so long as they continue to pay workers. The loan\ncan be used to cover 100% of six weeks\u2019 payroll (capped at $1,540 per week per\nemployee). The law calls for the loans to be forgiven if the money is used to\nretain workers or cover basic operational expenses.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Medicare Telehealth Waiver (Phase I)\n\n(I) Another Phase I provision with the somewhat clumsy name \u201cTelehealth\nServices During Certain Emergency Periods Act of 2020\u201d directs Medicare to let\nyou confer with medical professionals by phone, including FaceTime, Skype, and\nother telehealth services, even if you don\u2019t meet the requirement that that\nyou live in a rural area or have some other qualifying condition.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  HSAs Used for Telehealth and OTC Products (Phase III)\n\n(III) The CARES Act provides that HSAs paired with HDHPs can offer pre-\ndeductible coverage for Telehealth and other types of remote services. The Act\nalso extends the use of HSAs to non-prescription over the counter (OTC)\nmedicines and certain menstrual care products.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Paid Sick Leave (Phase II)\n\n(II) H.R. 6201, known as the \u201cFamilies First Coronavirus Response Act,\u201d\nmandates that your employer provide you with two weeks paid sick leave if you\nare isolated due to COVID-19, have been advised to self-quarantine, are\nexperiencing symptoms and seeking medical help, or are caring for someone\nunder quarantine. You get up to 12 weeks' paid leave if you are caring for a\nchild who is home because school is closed or your childcare provider is not\navailable because of coronavirus.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Free Coronavirus Testing (Phase II and III)\n\n(II) Phase II provides free FDA-approved COVID-19 testing for everyone\u2014even\nthose who are uninsured. Testing, without deductibles or copayments, includes\nthe cost of a trip to the doctor or emergency room to get the test. The\nlegislation does not cover additional tests or treatment. That will be up to\nyour current healthcare plan, including Medicare and Medicaid.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n(III) Phase III expands on the provisions of Phase II to include testing\nprovided by labs on an emergency basis, state-developed tests, and any other\ntests authorized by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Expanded Food Assistance (Phase II)\n\n(II) If you have food security issues\u2014something more likely to be the cas as\nmore and more people lose jobs due to workplace shutdowns\u2014Phase II offers\nhelp. This includes almost a billion dollars for the Special Supplemental\nNutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children Program (WIC).\ufeff\ufeff There's\nalso $400 million for emergency food assistance, help for those with children\neligible for free or reduced price school lunches whose school is closed, and\nemergency SNAP benefits including temporary suspension of the SNAP three-month\ntime limit on funding adults under 50 with no children.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n(III) Phase III provides $450 million for the Emergency Food Assistance\nProgram, to supply food banks and provide operational assistance. An\nadditional $200 million will go to food assistance for Puerto Rico and other\nU.S. territories plus $100 million for food distribution at American Indian\nreservations. Nearly $16 billion will be added to the Supplemental Nutrition\nAssistance Program (SNAP) and another $8.8 billion made available to Child\nNutrition Programs.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Protections for Healthcare Workers (Phase II)\n\n(II) If you are a healthcare worker, Phase II protects your medical and\nfinancial stability by requiring the [Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration (OSHA)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/occupational-\nsafety-and-health-act.asp) to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS)\nwithin 30 days that requires healthcare sector employers\u2014or other employers\ndesignated to be at elevated risk,\u2014\u201cto develop and implement a comprehensive\ninfectious disease exposure control plan to protect health care workers from\nexposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID19.\u201d In addition, OSHA must\nissue a permanent health and safety standard six months after the ETS has been\nissued.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Expanded Unemployment Benefits (Phase II and III)\n\n(II) Phase II provides nearly $1 billion in additional funding to states to be\nused to process and pay unemployment insurance. Assistance is also available\nto provide additional payments for those who have exhausted their benefits.\nCheck with your local unemployment office for details in your state.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n(III) Phase III provides an unprecedented boost in [unemployment\nbenefits](https://www.investopedia.com/federal-pandemic-unemployment-\ncompensation-fpuc-definition-4802039) including $600 per week per worker for\nfour months on top of state benefits. The stimulus package includes an\nadditional [13 weeks of extended\nbenefits](https://www.investopedia.com/pandemic-emergency-unemployment-\ncompensation-peuc-definition-4802046), paid for by the federal government. The\nlist of workers who qualify for unemployment benefits expands to include\n[independent contractors, the self-employed, and gig economy\nworkers](https://www.investopedia.com/pandemic-unemployment-assistance-pua-\ndefinition-4802064).For specifics check with your local unemployment office.\n\n###  $1,200\n\nThe amount to be sent to each adult with income of $75,000 or less.\n\n##  Direct Payments to Families (Phase III)\n\n(III) The latest legislation directs the U.S. Treasury to send most U.S.\nadults a check (or direct deposit) of $1,200 ($2,400 for couples filing\njointly). Each child age 16 and under will receive an additional $500.\nIndividuals with adjusted gross income (based on 2018 or 2019 tax returns) of\n$75,000 ($150,000 for couples filing jointly/$112,500 for head of household)\nor less will get the full amount. Your direct payment will be reduced five\ncents ($0.05) for every dollar you earned the amounts listed above until it\nhits zero at $99,000. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated most people\nwill get their payment within three weeks.\ufeff\ufeff \ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Suspension of Student Loan Payments (III)\n\n(III) The Department of Education will automatically suspend payments on\nDirect student loans without penalty through Sep. 30, 2020. Check with your\nloan servicer to make sure your payments have been suspended. You will receive\nmultiple notices after Aug. 1 letting you know about the end of the payment\nsuspension program.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Wages and Benefits for Airline Workers (III)\n\n(III) Included in the Phase III package is $32 billion in grants to cover\nwages and benefits for workers employed by passenger airlines, cargo airlines,\nand contractors. Companies that accept these funds and other assistance in the\nform of loans or loan guarantees are barred from making furloughs, pay cuts,\nstock buybacks, or issuing dividends to investors through Sep. 2020.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Public Health Fund (III)\n\n(III) The law creates a $100 billion public health and social emergency fund\ndesigned to reimburse providers for expenses and lost revenues during the\ncrisis. Most of the funds will go to hospitals with the rest earmarked for\ndoctors, nurses, suppliers, and others.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Protection Against Foreclosure and Eviction (III)\n\n(III) Phase III codifies protections for homeowners against foreclosure and\nrenters against eviction. If you are experiencing financial hardship due to\nthe coronavirus, you will be granted forbearance on your federally backed\nmortgage loan for up to 60 days, with the potential for up to four 30-day\nextensions. Foreclosures may not begin for 60 days from Mar. 18, 2020.\n\nNo fees, penalties, or added interest may be charged on delayed payments. If\nyou are a landlord with a mortgage on a multifamily home you have similar\nprotection that allows a 30-day forbearance on payments and up to two 30-day\nextensions.\n\nIf you are a renter in a multifamily home with a federally backed mortgage\nloan, you may not be evicted solely for failure to pay rent for a 6 months.\nYou also may not be charged fees or penalties for not paying rent.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Special Rules for Retirement Funds (III)\n\n(III) The CARES Act effectively waives the 10% tax penalty for early\nwithdrawals from retirement funds if those withdrawals are related to the\ncornonavirus. The waiver is retroactive to Jan. 1, 2020. Also, you are not\nsubject to a[ required minimum\ndistribution](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/retirement/02/121002.asp)\n(RMD) from your retirement account in 2020.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n##  Guarantee Money Market Mutual Funds (III)\n\n(III) If you are an investor, Section 4015 of the CARES Act that temporarily\nsuspends the restrictions of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008\nmight be of interest. The legislation permits the temporary use of the\n[Exchange Stabilization\nFund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangestabilizationfund.asp) to\nguarantee money market mutual funds. The guarantee will terminate December 31,\n2020. \ufeff\ufeff\n\n###  Article Sources\n\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.\nThese include white papers, government data, original reporting, and\ninterviews with industry experts.

(6 April\n2020)](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/furlough-employers-may-re-employ-\nstaff-who-left-after-28-february/).\n\nTelegraph Money has claimed that Treasury officials are looking into ways to\nhelp people who were caught between jobs in March, but no details have so far\nemerged. The Treasury did no confirm any such plans with Personnel Today.\n\nThe reason for the 28 February cut-off was to prevent fraud \u2013 February was the\nlast full month before the lockdown, so the Treasury used the month to gauge\npeople's salaries when formulating the job retention scheme.\n\nTreasury officials were said to accept that any cut-off date would have\nserious implications for people between jobs, but have taken the view that not\nevery business or individual job in the country would be saved.\n\nA Treasury spokesman told the Telegraph: \u201cObviously it\u2019s important to have\nproof that individuals are connected to the firms that are furloughing them.\u201d\n\nBut when asked by Personnel Today about the possiblity of rethinking the\nrules, an official simply said: \u201cThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme is aimed\nat those who would otherwise be unemployed as a result of coronavirus.\n\n\u201cIt allows for those who were on the payroll of a company on 28 February but\nsubsequently left to be put back on payroll and furloughed.\n\n\u201cDecisions around whether to offer to furlough someone are down to the\nindividual company.\u201d\n\nAs this implies, one route of escape from the loophole is for people's\nprevious organisations to re-employ them, then furlough them, so that they can\nreceive payments, but few firms so far have agreed to do this.\n\nMPs, including shadow chancellor John McDonnell, have urged chancellor Rishi\nSunak to act rapidly to help. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said people\nwere being unfairly \u201chung out to dry\u201d, with \u201ctheir dream jobs turning into\nnightmares\u201d.\n\nBBC News spoke to one woman whose plight was highly representative of the\nposition of several thousand people throughout the UK.\n\nNatalie Greenway, 24, left a job in retail management to start a new role as a\ncustomer services manager at a call centre on 16 March.\n\nGreenway, from Burbage, Leicestershire, said: \"I got the call from my company\nsaying 'we're so sorry, we can't furlough you'.\n\n\"They were really sympathetic and offered to keep me on the books unpaid so I\ncould have a job to go back to.\n\n\"I'm staying on the books, I'm not entitled to jobseekers as I am employed.\"\n\nThe Telegraph highlights the case of Jo Burton, 34, from Kent, who works in\nevents management \u2013 among sectors worst affected by the Covid-19 outbreak. She\nmoved jobs at the beginning of March but was made redundant within a week.\n\n\u201cWhen the government announced its job retention programme my new boss offered\nto hire me and put me on it straight away, but it then turned out I wasn\u2019t\neligible,\u201d she told the newspaper.\n\nSimmons & Simmons employment partner Olly Jones, said the loophole was\n\u201csomething the government was very much aware of at the time its guidance was\nproduced\u201d.\n\nJones added that what is being referred to as a loophole was \u201cintended as an\nanti-fraud measure to avoid, in particular, companies employing friends and\nfamily and immediately furloughing them. It remains to be seen whether\nministers will bow to the pressure to change the position with the significant\nadditional costs and potential for abuse such a change would bring.\u201d\n\n[job retention scheme](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/tag/job-retention-\nscheme/)\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/251145/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/company-car-benefit-in-kind-\ntax-coronavirus/)\n\n### 3 Responses to _Treasury urged to look again at coronavirus scheme\nloophole_\n\n  1. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/28b502b1d2d9455ae5f9d3f5a65709af?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\n\nJamie kinsley Wilson 4 Apr 2020 at 6:52 pm\n[#](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/treasury-looks-again-at-coronavirus-\nscheme-loophole/#comment-87806 \"Direct link to this comment\")\n\nDear sirs I am also one of those unfortunate enough Not to have qualified for\nthe furlough and have been dismissed from my job of two weeks in, in March\n2020 .

I have been very lucky as\nthey are paying me 50% of my monthly salary but wonder how long this will\nlast.\n\nWhy has the government created an obstacle in myself having to go cap in hand\nto my old

This will be driven by the level of expertise required and the\nappetite for change from ECC.\n\n### How much more council tax will I pay?\n\nThe increase in council tax will affect different families in different ways.\n\nIt all depends on which band your home falls into.\n\nThe bands are calculated based upon the value of your property based upon its\nmarket value in 1991.\n\nThe amount of council tax you pay will vary based upon whether you home is\nwithin the area governed by Leigh-on-Sea Town Council or Southend Borough\nCouncil.\n\nAreas within the Leigh-on-Sea Town Council pay more because they are\nresponsible for funds being divided between both the town council and Southend\nBorough Council.\n\nFollowing planned council tax increases:\n\n  * Band A homes in Southend Borough Council areas will pay an extra \u00a341.52 a year\n  * Band B homes in Southend Borough Council areas will pay an extra \u00a348.44 a year\n  * Band C homes in Southend Borough Council areas will pay an extra \u00a355.36 a year\n  * Band D homes in Southend Borough Council areas will pay an extra \u00a362.28 a year\n  * Band E homes in Southend Borough Council areas will pay an extra \u00a376.12 a year\n  * Band F homes in Southend Borough Council areas will pay an extra \u00a389.96 a year\n  * Band G homes in Southend Borough Council areas will pay an extra \u00a3103.80 a year\n  * Band H homes in Southend Borough Council areas will pay an extra \u00a3124.56 a year\n\nIn areas within the Leigh-on-Sea Town Council's governing zone\n\n  * Band A homes in Leigh-on-Sea Town Council areas will pay an extra \u00a343.44 a year\n  * Band B homes in Leigh-on-Sea Town Council areas will pay an extra \u00a350.68 a year\n  * Band C homes in Leigh-on-Sea Town Council areas will pay an extra \u00a357.92 a year\n  * Band D homes in Leigh-on-Sea Town Council areas will pay an extra \u00a365.16 a year\n  * Band E homes in Leigh-on-Sea Town Council areas will pay an extra \u00a379.64 a year\n  * Band F homes in Leigh-on-Sea Town Council areas will pay an extra \u00a394.12 a year\n  * Band G homes in Leigh-on-Sea Town Council areas will pay an extra \u00a3108.60 a year\n  * Band H homes in Leigh-on-Sea Town Council areas will pay an extra \u00a3130.32 a year\n\n\u201cIt is therefore difficult to estimate savings however the ability to offshore\nwould provide ECC with the potential to make savings. For example, last year\nECC commissioned 505 days of chargeable time which cost circa \u00a3400,000,\nwhereas under the proposed new model and blended rate card, this would have\ncost \u00a3119,000.\n\n\u201cThe actual cost saving to ECC going forward will be dependent on the volume\nof change ECC determines it needs to maintain and/or enhance system\nfunctionality.\u201d\n\nessexlivenews\n\nFollow @essexlive\n\nComments\n\nShow more comments\n\nMore On\n\n  * [Essex County

[+] Public Health and Environment Laboratory\nServices Division on Saturday. March 14, 2020 in Denver, Colorado. (Photo by\nHyoung Chang/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images)\n\nDenver Post via Getty Images\n\nAs numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 continue to increase in the United\nStates, the federal government is taking actions to reduce the impact on\nindividual and business taxpayers.\n\nCOVID-19 is the official name for the infectious disease caused by the most\nrecently discovered coronavirus. [According to the World Health\nOrganization](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses\n\"https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses\"), as of March 14,\n2020, there are 142,538 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 135 territories and\ncountries. According to Johns Hopkins, the United States[ has 2,572 confirmed\ncases](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\n\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\").\n\nAs part of the response, the House passed H.R. 6201,  _Families First\nCoronavirus Response Act._  Here are some of the highlights in the bill:\n\n  * **Funding for nutrition assistance programs.**  Specifically, funds are designated for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) and the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). Also, there is a provision to allow state plans to provide food assistance to households with children who would otherwise receive free or reduced-price meals if not for their schools being closed due to the COVID-19 emergency. \n  * **Funding for the Senior Nutrition Program in the Administration for Community Living (ACL).**  Provides approximately 25 million additional home-delivered and pre-packaged meals to low-income seniors, including those with chronic illnesses and disabilities, who depend on the Senior Nutrition programs in their communities. \n  * **Reimbursement for COVID-19 diagnostic testing and services provided to those without health insurance**. \n  * **Funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs.**  Funds will cover the costs of COVID-19 diagnostic testing for veterans receiving care through Medical Services or through Medical Community Care.\n  * **Job-protected leave.**  Government employees and employees of employers with fewer than 500 employees* who have been on the job for at least 30 days will have the right to take job-protected leave. The leave can be used for quarantine due to exposure to or symptoms of coronavirus; to care for an at-risk family member quarantined due to exposure to or symptoms of coronavirus; and to care for a child of an employee if the child\u2019s school or child care has been closed or is unavailable due to coronavirus. *The 500 employee language is intended to be more inclusive than the existing protections under the [Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla/general-guidance \"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla/general-guidance\") but does leave out some employees; you can read more about the controversy from [Vox](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/14/21179925/coronavirus-house-bill-paid-leave-leave-out-millions-workers \"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/14/21179925/coronavirus-house-bill-paid-leave-leave-out-millions-workers\") and [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/coronavirus-pelosi-sick-leave.html \"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/coronavirus-pelosi-sick-leave.html\").\n  * **Emergency transfers for Unemployment Compensation administration.**  The bill provides $1 billion for emergency grants to states for activities related to processing and paying unemployment insurance benefits.\n  * **Health plan testing coverage.**  The bill requires private health plans to provide coverage for COVID-19 diagnostic testing, including the cost of a provider, urgent care center, and emergency room visits. Also, Medicare Part B and Advantage, TRICARE, Medicaid, and CHIP must cover expenses for provider visits during which a COVID-19 test is administered or ordered. \n  * **Tax credits for paid sick and paid family and medical leave.  **The bill provides for a refundable tax credit equal to 100% of qualified paid sick or family leave wages paid by an employer for each calendar quarter. The tax credit is allowed against the employer portion of Social Security taxes. The credit applies to amounts paid to employees who are sick or quarantined; a lesser credit applies to amounts paid to employees caring for a family member or for a child whose school or place of care has been closed. Caps and limits apply.\n  * **Tax credits for leave apply to self-employed individuals, too.**  Self-employed individuals qualify for the refundable credits, too, including those who must self-isolate, obtain a diagnosis, or comply with a self-isolation recommendation for coronavirus. Again, those self-employed individuals caring for a family member or for a child whose school or place of care has been closed due to coronavirus, are allowed a lesser refundable tax credit. As with employees, caps and limits apply.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what\u2019s not in the bill:\n\n  * **No extension of the tax filing deadline in 2020.**  Fortunately, that no longer matters. On March 20, 2020, the tax filing and payment deadlines were [officially extended](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/20/irs-pushes-filing-and-payment-deadlines-to-july-15/#4aba9b5f23e2 \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/19/all-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-recent-irs-tax-payment-relief-but-were-afraid-to-ask/#42a0a57645d5\") from April 15, 2020, to July 15, 2020.\n  * **No payroll tax cuts.**  President Trump called for [payroll tax relief](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/10/after-coronavirus-fueled-stock-market-drop-trump-considers-payroll-tax-relief/#31a415263d18 \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/10/after-coronavirus-fueled-stock-market-drop-trump-considers-payroll-tax-relief/#31a415263d18\") to last through the election, but neither party in Congress seems inclined to agree. Why? Primarily because it\u2019s expensive: estimates suggest the [cost](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/business/trump-tax-cut-coronavirus.html \"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/business/trump-tax-cut-coronavirus.html\") could reach $90 billion per month.\n\nToday In: [Taxes](https://www.forbes.com/taxes)\n\n  * [\n\n### Ask Larry: Will My Social Security Benefits Be Reduced If I Earn $12,000\nThis Year?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kotlikoff/2020/04/07/ask-larry-will-my-social-\nsecurity-benefits-be-reduced-if-i-earn-12000-this-year/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Free Money For Small Business?

It was a horrible experience. In a desperate\nattempt to avoid anything like that in the future, I enrolled in a tax course.\nI loved it. I signed up for another. Before I knew it, in addition to my JD, I\nearned an LL.M Taxation. While at law school, I interned at the estates\nattorney division of the IRS. At IRS, I participated in the review and audit\nof federal estate tax returns. At one such audit, opposing counsel read my\nreport, looked at his file and said, \"Gentlemen, she\u2019s exactly right.\" I\nnearly fainted. It was a short jump from there to practicing, teaching,\nwriting and breathing tax.

250 firm FDM\n\n![US-IT-ZOOM](https://www.cityam.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/1208677867-960x665.jpg)(via Getty Images)\n\nThe destruction caused by the Covid-19 outbreak is difficult to comprehend,\nrobbing people of their lives and livelihoods without mercy. Our NHS,\ncharities, large businesses, start-ups and entrepreneurs have all been hit\nhard, with the elderly and vulnerable hit the hardest.\n\nI\u2019ve been in business for 40 years now. Together we\u2019ve survived the tornado of\n1987, Black Wednesday, the dot com bubble bursting, the global financial crash\nand I was in DC when the plane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, yet right now it\nfeels like we have all five crises at once.\n\nAs a FTSE 250 company with nearly 6,000 staff globally, we have a huge\nresponsibility to ensure each and every single one of our people is safe,\nsecure and looked after, something which is incredibly challenging due to\nsocial isolation and remote working.\n\nPeople are the lifeblood of any business, and when the chips are down a good\nemployer will stand by their people.\n\nLike many company owners right now, I\u2019ve been trying to manage the huge task\nof shifting to a 100% remote working model. Whilst an optimistic view of the\nscenario is to just switch on email and work from home, the reality is\npayroll, HR, sales and support networks need to quickly adapt to this new way\nof working, without error, which I can tell you first hand is easier said than\ndone.\n\nLike many CEOs I have had to use my past experience to keep a cool head and\nfocus on making sure we deliver a robust and secure online environment for our\nemployees to alleviate the inevitable security fears. We managed to achieve\nthis in four days, with the help of our brilliant IT staff and software\npartners.\n\nOur people come from all walks of life and backgrounds. Women returners, ex-\nmilitary service personnel, fresh-faced graduates and those looking for a\ncareer in IT.\n\nMany of them are now juggling home working with family life, caring for sick\nor elderly relatives. As a Dad myself I know this is no easy task, I also know\nthat many of our employees will feel lonely, isolated and in need of help in\nthe coming weeks.\n\nSo how can companies foster a working from home culture that ensures everyone\nfeels valued and how on earth can this be put into motion in a short space of\ntime? For a start, I believe the CEO should be highly visible at all times\nduring a crisis, which means I am constantly on company-wide video calls,\nanswering questions online and appearing in our weekly #RodsRoundUp video\nposted on Twitter, updating our people on developments as they happen.\n\nWe\u2019ve introduced company quiz schemes, problem solving tasks and workgroup\nonline meetings, so that everyone can get involved and raise a smile, despite\nthe turmoil.\n\nOur HR team is operating as usual, providing promotions and annual reviews via\nprivate video links and every member of staff has been offered mental health\nsupport and guidance if they are feeling isolated or anxious.\n\nThe fact remains that until the lockdown is lifted, our people will continue\nto be working from home for the foreseeable future. So rather than view this\nsituation with regret, we must embrace it, look after each other and throw\nourselves into new ways of working. It\u2019s also vital that companies keep paying\ntheir staff and don\u2019t stop recruiting; those that freeze the hiring process\nwill find themselves dangerously lacking in talent once things get moving\nagain.\n\nNobody can lessen the harsh consequences brought on by Covid-19, but as\nbusiness leaders and employers, we have a duty to ensure our staff can do\ntheir jobs online to the best of their ability. There may be chaos, there will\nbe heartache, sleepless nights and huge challenges ahead, but putting people\nfirst should be a top priority for every business right now.\n\n _City A.M.'s opinion pages are a place for thought-provoking views and\ndebate.

The original bill, H.R. 6201, _Families\nFirst Coronavirus Response Act,_ cleared the House last week.\n\nCOVID-19 is the official name for the infectious disease caused by the most\nrecently discovered coronavirus. [According to the World Health\nOrganization](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses\n\"https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses\"), as of March 18,\n2020, there are 193,029 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 164 territories and\ncountries.

The impact\nhas been felt immediately by some businesses, including those who depend on\nin-person customer interaction.\n\nAfter initially suggesting that the bill was flawed, Sen. Majority Leader\nMitch McConnell got behind it, saying, \"This is a time for urgent bipartisan\naction, and in this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the\nenemy of something that will help even a subset of workers.\"\n\nThe bill passed with a vote of 90-8 (and two abstentions).

The most notable was a\nsound 95-3 no vote on a motion by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) intended to \"amend the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to require a social security number for purposes\nof the child tax credit, to provide the President the authority to transfer\nfunds as necessary, and to terminate United States military operations and\nreconstruction activities in Afghanistan.\" You can see how your Senator voted\non the Paul amendment\n[here](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=116&session=2&vote=00073\n\"https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=116&session=2&vote=00073\")\n(spoiler Alert: only Braun (R-IN), Lee (R-UT), and Paul (R-KY) voted yes).\n\nThe President signed the bill into law on Wednesday, March 18, 2020.

It was a horrible experience. In a desperate\nattempt to avoid anything like that in the future, I enrolled in a tax course.\nI loved it. I signed up for another. Before I knew it, in addition to my JD, I\nearned an LL.M Taxation. While at law school, I interned at the estates\nattorney division of the IRS. At IRS, I participated in the review and audit\nof federal estate tax returns. At one such audit, opposing counsel read my\nreport, looked at his file and said, \"Gentlemen, she\u2019s exactly right.\" I\nnearly fainted.

Sirleaf has dismissed with\nimmediate effect Mr. Stephen Kayea, Director of Human Resource at the Ministry\nof Internal Affairs (MIA) for falsifying and paddling the Ministry\u2019s payroll.\n\nAccording to a dismissal letter dated March 24, 2020 issued Mr. Kayea, the\ndismissal stemmed from the fact that he has been adding names on the\nministry\u2019s payroll without authorization.\n\nA release from the Ministry quotes Minister Sirleaf as saying, Mr. Kayea\u2019s\naction of payroll paddling is highly inappropriate and counterproductive to\nGovernment\u2019s fight against corruption.\n\nFor the past months, the MIA has been investigating circumstances leading to\nwhat is responsible for a bloated payroll despite repeated efforts aimed at\ncleaning the payroll of ghost names.\n\nThe dismissal is also in line with the Civil Service Standing Orders of 2012,\nChapter 4, Section 2, subsection 4.2.2d & h., which state that \u201cWhen a case of\nmisconduct or general inefficiency is brought to the attention of an Agency\nHead or the Director-General, disciplinary proceedings shall be initiated only\nafter the employee or officer concerned has been given adequate opportunity to\nexculpate himself.\n\n4.2.2 If an employee fails to exculpate himself, the following shall apply:\n(Suspension, Dismissal)g. Conduct Unbecoming of employee in the Public Service\nand h. Dishonesty in the Conduct of Government business\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Minister Sirleaf has requested Mr. Kayea to turn over all office\nmaterials, documents and equipment in his possession to Mr. Thomas L. Hoff,\nDirector, Personnel Action Notices (PAN) Section/HR, who will serve as\ncaretaker of the Section until a suitable candidate is named.\n\nMinister Sirleaf has reemphasized the Ministry stance against dishonesty and\nmisconduct and calls on all employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to\nbe patriotic and nationalistic in the discharge of their duties.

state, education  \nShutterstock\n\n**The Department for Education last night published a list of key workers\nwhose children will still receive schooling despite the coronavirus\noutbreak.**\n\nFrom Monday 23 March schools across the UK will be expected to provide care\nfor the children of:\n\n  * frontline health and social care staff including the distributors of medicines and vital equipment\n  * teaching staff, nursery staff and social workers\n  * people working in vital public services such as justice system, death registry workers, journalists in public service broadcasting\n  * government workers in local or national administrations in occupations needed to deliver the Covid-19 response and pay benefits\n  * food production and processing workers including sales and delivery staff\n  * transport workers operating services not shut down during the Covid-19 response\n  * utilities workers including all power, water, sewerage, chemicals\n  * postal workers, key telecommunications staff, bank workers\n\nThe Department for Education said: \u201cIf your work is critical to the Covid-19\nresponse, or you work in one of the critical sectors listed below, and you\ncannot keep your child safe at home then your children will be prioritised for\neducation provision.\u201d\n\nThe list had been expected to be published on Thursday but, speaking on BBC\nQuestion Time, health secretary Matt Hancock confirmed that the list would be\npublished overnight.\n\nSchools have shut their gates to all today, with the new system up and running\non Monday.\n\nChildren with at least one parent or carer identified as critical workers by\nthe government could send their children to school if required, the DfE added.\n\nMost educational establishments, where required, are expected to stay open for\nthe children of key workers but the DfE said it recognised it may be\n\u201cimpossible\u201d for small rural schools. In such cases, officials have stated,\nalternative settings for pupils would be found and transport provided where\nnecessary.\n\n## Education sector HR roles on Personnel Today\n\n  \n[**Browse more

Nevius, J.D.**  \n\nUpdated:\n\n  \n\nRelated\n\nTOPICS\n\n  * [Tax](/topics/topic-results.jofa.tax.html)\n    * [C Corporation Income Taxation](/topics/topic-results.jofa.tax.c-corporation-income-taxation.html)\n    * [IRS Practice and Procedure](/topics/topic-results.jofa.tax.irs-practice-and-procedure.html)\n    * [Individual Income Taxation](/topics/topic-results.jofa.tax.individual-income-taxation.html)\n  * [COVID-19](/topics/topic-results.jofa.covid-19.html)\n    * [Advocacy & Tax Relief](/topics/topic-results.jofa.covid-19.advocacy-and-tax-relief.html)\n\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, H.R. 748,\nwhich passed the Senate by a 96-0 vote late on Wednesday, contains a host of\ntax measures as part of a $2 trillion aid package designed to help the economy\nas it suffers from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. While the focus of\nthe legislation is not tax, a large number of tax provisions are included in\nthe over-600-page bill. [ _Update_ : The House of Representatives passed the\nbill by a voice vote on Friday, March 27, and President Donald Trump signed it\nthat afternoon.]\n\n**Recovery rebates:** The bill provides for payments to taxpayers \u2014 \u201crecovery\nrebates\u201d \u2014 which are being treated as advance refunds of a 2020 tax credit.\nUnder this provision, individuals will receive a tax credit of $1,200 ($2,400\nfor joint filers) plus $500 for each qualifying child. The credit is phased\nout for taxpayers with adjusted gross income (AGI) above $150,000 (for joint\nfilers), $112,500 (for heads of household), and $75,000 for other individuals.\nThe credit is not available to nonresident aliens, individuals who can be\nclaimed as a dependent by another taxpayer, and estates and trusts. Taxpayers\nwill reduce the amount of the credit available on their 2020 tax return by the\namount of the advance refund payment they receive.\n\n**Payroll tax credit refunds:** The bill provides for advance refunding of the\npayroll tax credits enacted last week in the Families First Coronavirus\nResponse Act, P.L. 116-127. The credit for required paid sick leave and the\ncredit for required paid family leave can be refunded in advance using forms\nand instructions the IRS will provide. The IRS is instructed to waive any\npenalties for failure to deposit payroll taxes under Sec. 3111(a) or 3221(a)\nif the failure was due to an anticipated payroll tax credit.\n\n**Employee retention credit:** The bill creates an employee retention credit\nfor employers that close due to the coronavirus pandemic. Eligible employers\nare allowed a credit against employment taxes equal to 50% of qualified wages\n(up to $10,000 in wages) for each employee. Eligible employers are employers\nwho were carrying on a trade or business during 2020 and for which the\noperation of that business is fully or partially suspended due to orders from\nan appropriate governmental authority limiting commerce, travel, or group\nmeetings due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Employers that have gross receipts that\nare less than 50% of their gross receipts for the same quarter in the prior\nyear are also eligible, until their gross receipts exceed 80% of their gross\nreceipts for the same calendar quarter in the prior year. For employers with\nmore than 100 employees, wages eligible for the credit are wages that the\nemployer pays employees who are not providing services due to the suspension\nof the business or a drop in gross receipts. For employers with 100 or fewer\nemployees, all wages paid qualify for the credit. However, for purposes of the\ncredit, eligible wages do not include wages counted for purposes of the paid\nsick leave and paid family leave payroll tax credits in the Families First\nCoronavirus act. Also, if an employer receives a covered paycheck protection\nprogram loan under Section 1102 of the act, the employer is not eligible to\nclaim an employee retention credit.\n\n**Retirement plans:** Taxpayers can take up to $100,000 in coronavirus-related\ndistributions from retirement plans without being subject to the Sec. 72(t)\n10% additional tax for early distributions. Eligible distributions can be\ntaken up to Dec. 31, 2020. Coronavirus-related distributions may be repaid\nwithin three years. For these purposes, an eligible taxpayer is one who has\nbeen diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 virus or COVID-19 disease or whose spouse or\ndependent has been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 virus or COVID-19 disease or who\nexperiences adverse financial consequences from being quarantined, furloughed,\nor laid off, or who has had his or her work hours reduced, or who is unable to\nwork due to lack of child care. Any resulting income inclusion can be taken\nover three years. The bill also allows loans of up to $100,000 from qualified\nplans, and repayment can be delayed.\n\nThe bill temporarily suspends the required minimum distribution rules in Sec.\n401 for 2020.\n\nThe bill delays 2020 minimum required contributions for single-employer plans\nuntil 2021.\n\n**Charitable deductions:** The bill creates an above-the-line charitable\ndeduction for 2020 (not to exceed $300). The bill also modifies the AGI\nlimitations on charitable contributions for 2020, to 100% of AGI for\nindividuals and 25% of taxable income for corporations. The bill also\nincreases the food contribution limits to 25%.\n\n**Payroll tax delay:** The bill delays payment of 50% of 2020 employer payroll\ntaxes until Dec. 31, 2021; the other 50% will be due Dec. 31, 2022. For self-\nemployment taxes, 50% will not be due until those same dates.\n\n**Net operating losses:** The bill temporarily repeals the 80% income\nlimitation for net operating loss deductions for years beginning before 2021.\nFor losses arising in 2018, 2019, and 2020, a five-year carryback is allowed\n(taxpayers can elect to forgo the carryback).\n\n**Excess loss limitations:** The bill repeals the Sec. 461(l) excess loss\nlimitation. Sec. 461(l) was added to the Code by the law known as the Tax Cuts\nand Jobs Act, P.L. 115-97, and it disallows excess business losses of\nnoncorporate taxpayers if the amount of the loss exceeds $250,000 ($500,000\nfor married taxpayers filing jointly).\n\n**Corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT):** The bill modifies the AMT credit\nfor corporations to make it a refundable credit for 2018 tax years.\n\n**Interest limitation:** For tax years beginning in 2019 and 2020, Sec. 163(j)\nis amended to increase the adjusted taxable income percentage from 30% to 50%.\nAlso, taxpayers can elect to use 2019 income in place of 2020 for the\ncomputation.\n\n**Qualified improvement property:** The bill also makes technical corrections\nregarding qualified improvement property under Sec. 168 by making it 15-year\nproperty.\n\n**Aviation taxes:** Various aviation excise taxes are suspended until 2021.\n\n**Health plans:** The rules for high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) are\namended to allow them to cover telehealth and other remote care services\nwithout charging a deductible.\n\nOver-the-counter menstrual care products are added to the list of items that\ncan be reimbursed out of a health savings account, Archer medical savings\naccount, or health reimbursement arrangement.\n\n_For more news and reporting on the coronavirus and how CPAs can handle\nchallenges related to the outbreak, visit the  _JofA _\u2019s  _[ _coronavirus\nresources page_](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/info/coronavirus-\nresources-for-cpas.html) _._\n\n_\u2014   **Alistair M.

A lot of companies believe in\noutsourcing their payroll to achieve the best results.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834a727bc9a.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nPayroll management is more than just scheduling out paychecks. With modern\ntechnologies shaping the human resources department, here is a look at how the\npayroll trends are evolving in 2020 and how you can effectively adapt to them.\n\n### **Automate Your Payroll**\n\nThis era of digital industrialization emphasizes the importance of automation.\nIt\u2019s not just the product lineup that you should be automating. Everything\nfrom sending out newsletters to sending out paychecks is also under a dire\nneed of automation.\n\nManual payroll has almost come to a halt and there are hardly any companies\nout there where someone is personally moving out to hand the employees their\nmonthly compensation. Automation has several advantages over traditional\nmethods, which are:\n\n  * Automated payroll is less prone to errors when compared to manual payroll. The calculations involved can be intense when it has to be done manually.   \n\n  * Automation makes the payroll process extremely fast and efficient. It is known to reduce payroll time significantly.   \n\n  * Timekeeping can be done efficiently which includes the calculation of compensation given to each employee depending on the hours they have dedicated. This will include overtime payment and deduction in the case of time shortage. With automated timekeeping systems like biometric or RFID, the chances of errors are reduced to almost nil.   \n\n  * Automation can also be cost-effective in many cases. If the number of employees of a company involved with payroll management is plenty, an automation [system](https://paybooks.in/payroll-management-system-features/) can definitely prove to be cheaper and faster.   \n\n  * Automation will also avoid any kind of delays. No delays will ensure the employees are always happy and don\u2019t have to go through any extra trouble because of something that\u2019s not their fault. \n\n###  \n**Keep a Track of Your Employees and Improvise**\n\n  \nIdentifying the top talent in a company and retaining them is the key to\nkeeping the company ranking high up the charts in all indices. Continuous\nmonitoring of data is the best way to analyze the performance metrics of each\nemployee and compensating them appropriately.\n\nThere are many **SaaS** agencies that help with people\u2019s analytics and data-\ndriven decisions to make the best of the available resources.\n\n  * Data Analytics is a growing field and can be used in payroll management as well. The data such as target completion and leaves taken can be collected through automated systems  \n\n  * Tracking Key Performance Indicators has been identified as one of the most important things to better understand your employees and compute various data related components like processing time per cycle, incomplete payments and the possible errors that might occur.   \n\n  * While tracking is the key, constant improvement is needed to make the best of it. The best thing to do is to merge similar processes to give the best to your employees. For example, HR and payroll need to be unified, otherwise, each process going on in one corner is going to make things very inefficient.   \n\n  * **Outsourcing** the analytics needs can be one of the best possible solutions to overcome the problem because hiring in house analytics team can sometimes be costlier and not be feasible for some small companies. \n\n  \n**Learn More:[How Faster Payments Are Impacting the Future of\nWork](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-administration/how-\nfaster-payments-are-impacting-the-future-of-work/)**\n\n### **Step up the Security**\n\nUndoubtedly, security and safety is the most important parameter in the age\nwhere cybercrimes have become so common. Luckily, this year\u2019s focus is going\nto be on the safety of the payroll data and this is being commonly employed in\nvarious companies.\n\n  * The payroll software and tools available are fairly secure as they are password protected and have various levels of encryption to ensure nobody can breach it. \n  * Automated security also means there are no papers that can be left lying around and the risk of it getting into the hands of the wrong person is completely eliminated. \n  * Since the system will make sure that no double entry is present, the account of the company is safe and any losses in terms of duplicate transactions cannot take place. \n  * **SaaS** makes sure that any payroll software provided to a company is void of defects and cannot be broken into. \n\n  \nWhile these trends are what is expected in the upcoming year, nobody can be\n100% sure about the future and that\u2019s why adaptability is very important. All\nsystems and tools that are being used should be interoperable and flexible to\nadapt to upcoming technology.\n\nStaying close to these trends is going to be one of the best things for the\npayroll management of your company and you can enter the new year prepared\nwith the best of knowledge.\n\n**Learn More:[Rewarding Human Capital Management (HCM) with

Best](http://hrmasia.com/category/regular-features/five-of-the-\nbest/) is a weekly series highlighting the best HR service providers across\nSingapore and the Southeast Asia region. It is brought to you by\n[www.hrmasia.com](http://www.hrmasia.com/)._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/HRIS-79466851_m-1.jpg)\n\nThere\u2019s simply no way to overstate the value of a good HR Information System\nto any employing organisation. With some of the key touchpoints between staff,\nand across levels, it is the lifeblood of not just the HR team, but the entire\norganisation as a whole.\n\nOf course, it needs to be functional. And for many years, this was the only\nconsideration HR leaders had in choosing a system (or different modules) to\nimplement. As long as the payroll was delivered on time and accurately, and\nexpense claims were able to be examined, the system was said to be doing its\njob.\n\nBut these days, HR leaders are seeing the opportunities and risks within each\ntechnological solution they consider. They know that tech that isn\u2019t fully\nembraced by the workforce can impact retention, which means user experience\nhas become a vital point of difference.\n\nHere are five of the best service providers in this category:\n\n### JUZ TALENT\n\n**[www.juztalent.com](http://www.juztalent.com)**\n\n**+65 6384 3808**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JuzTalent-\nimage-250x175.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JuzTalent-\nimage.jpg)When businesses are considering investing in a workforce or payroll\nsolution, they\u2019ll likely begin to think about cost-effectiveness, automation,\nand value creation. The driver to JuzTalent's success by acquiring 50,000\nusers within three years has been due to understanding HR and complex payroll\nissues that every business will face in the different part of Southeast Asia.\n\nJuzTalent was built by professionals with deep HR understanding. It is a one-\nof-a-kind HRMS focused on the user\u2019s experience \u2013 from the effortless self-\nservice onboarding to radius clock-in and clock-out, personalised payslips,\nand not forgetting management and leaders are sent light-hearted notifications\nto keep the whole claim and leave processes moving.\n\nFurthermore, every client of JuzTalent is greeted with a realistic drawing of\nproblem-solving and results based insights. Whether it be small or mid-sized\nbusinesses, JuzTalent is able to provide an overview connecting an\norganisation\u2019s multiple entities operating under a single platform while they\nfocus and grow with autonomy.\n\n### BIPO\n\n[**www.biposervice.com**](http://www.biposervice.com)\n\n**+65 6877 6925**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BIPO-5-of-the-\nbest-1-250x141.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BIPO-5-of-\nthe-best-1.jpg)Founded in 2004, BIPO\u2019s Asia-Pacific Headquarters is in\nSingapore, with R&D Centres located in Singapore, Shanghai, Malaysia and\nIndonesia.\n\nBIPO\u2019s integrated, one-stop cloud and mobile-based HRMS platform helps\nbusinesses simplify and streamline HR processes. From payroll, leave\nmanagement, and claims to time and attendance management, each application is\ninterrelated yet easily customised to help businesses scale-up their\noperations with ease.\n\nOffering a great user-experience through its simple, user-friendly interface,\nBIPO\u2019s award-winning **time and attendance management system** uses technology\nsuch as GPS, biometrics and iris scanners to support its clocking devices,\nallowing employees who are constantly on-the-move to stay agile and connected.\n\nCompliant with local regulatory requirements across all the regions, BIPO\u2019s\nHRMS platform is LHDN-certified (PCB \u2013 Monthly Tax Deduction Calculation) in\nMalaysia and in Singapore, adheres to CPF and IRA8 online submission\nrequirements.\n\n### JUST LOGIN\n\n[**www.justlogin.com**](https://justlogin.com)\n\n**+65 6909 9217**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/justlogin-5ofbest-250x188.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/justlogin-5ofbest.jpg)In the last decade, the role of\nHRIS has shifted beyond just storing and tracking of employee data.

Nonprofits Included In COVID-19 Tax Bill\n\n  * Mark Hrywna\n  *     * News\n  *     * March 19, 2020\n\nNonprofits are included in a payroll income tax credit as part of federal\nlegislation that will provide emergency paid sick leave, more funding for food\nassistance and unemployment benefits, and coronavirus testing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed the bill last night after it passed the Senate\nyesterday by a vote of 90-8. The House of Representatives approved H.R. 6201\nearly Saturday morning by a vote of 363-40. It\u2019s the second measure this month\nthat Congress has passed in response to COVID-19 and a third, even larger bill\ncould be on the way.\n\nThe eight senators who voted against the bill were: Marsha Blackburn\n(R-Tenn.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), James Lankford\n(R-Okla.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rand Paul (R-Kent.), Ben Sasse (R-Ark), and Tim\nScott (R-S.C.).\n\n\u201cThe bill looks very good for both nonprofits entities and for the people we\nserve,\u201d Steve Taylor, senior vice president and counsel for public policy at\nUnited Way Worldwide, said in an interview with _The NonProfit Times_ on\nMonday as the [\u201cFamilies First Coronavirus Response Act\" (H.R.\n6201)](https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/Families%20First%20Summary%20FINAL.pdf)\nwas on its way to the Senate. \u201cThere\u2019s been pretty widespread advocacy in the\nsector because the bill does look good.\u201d\n\nThe measure includes about $1 billion in funding related to food and\nnutrition, through Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and The\nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC),\nand The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). \u201cThat\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\nAn earlier COVID-19 related bill, passed less than two weeks ago, provided\nmore than $8 billion, mostly directed toward state health agencies. With H.R.\n6201, Congress is \u201ctrying to get ahead of the economic impact from everything\nthat is happening as a result,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nTypically, federal economic stimulus and disaster relief bills are designed to\nhelp for-profit businesses, primarily through income tax credits -- which\nisn\u2019t relevant to nonprofits. In this bill, the tax credit will be against\npayroll taxes, which all employers have to pay. \u201cThis was a big win for the\nnonprofit sector, just that provision, that there\u2019s economic relief,\u201d Taylor\nsaid.\n\nThe payroll tax credit will go toward reimbursing employers some of the cost\nof providing two weeks of full paid sick leave, if needed, because of the\nvirus and implications of the virus. The provision applies to any employer\nwith fewer than 500 employees, which is the overwhelming majority of employers\nin the U.S.\n\nThe bill also includes expansion of the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). It\nallows employees to 12 weeks of unpaid family leave without risk to their\njobs. That provision affects only employers with less than 500 employees.\n\u201cThis might be part of a larger movement toward paid family leave in the U.S.,\na combination of those two provisions could advance that,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nHe credited the [National Council of\nNonprofits](http://www.councilofnonprofits.org) for getting charities and\nassociations to quickly sign on to a letter last week and get it to Congress\nadvocating to get nonprofits a credit toward payroll instead of income tax.\n\n\u201cThis is a really good start, providing immediate impact, relief and\nincentives for business to give employees two weeks of paid leave,\u201d Taylor\nsaid, but he expects there will be \u201cprobably more after this.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cmore\u201d is coming together fast and will dwarf the other two bills,\naccording to Taylor. It could include [$60 billion sought by the group of the\nnation\u2019s largest charities](https://www.thenonprofittimes.com/news/nonprofits-\nseek-federal-covid-19-financial-help/), including United Way.\n\n[United Way Worldwide](http://www.liveunited.org) signed on to support a\nrequest of $60 billion in economic stimulus and COVID-19 relief for the\ncharitable sector.

Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\nMinister for Manpower, Josephine Teo, and Minister of State for Manpower, Zaqy\nMohamad answered a series of Parliamentary questions this week, on the\nfollowing topics:\n\n  * Adoption of abesentee payroll\n  * Employment discrimination based on religious wear\n  * Correlation of private sector bonuses with civil service bonuses\n  * Malaysians working in Singapore\n  * Food delivery riders' transition to using PMD alternatives\n  * Securing jobs for Singaporeans through the ITMs\n\nTheir answers, relevant for employers, have been summarised below.\n\n### Adoption of absentee payroll\n\nAbsentee payroll funding is a relatively newer topic brought up in Parliament,\nraised this week by MP Zainal Sapari, regarding [absentee payroll under the\nWorkfare Training Support (WTS)\nScheme](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-questions-and-\nreplies/2020/0106-written-answer-by-mrs-josephine-teo-minister-for-manpower-\nto-pq-on-absentee-payroll-under-wts).\n\nTo clarify, absentee payroll covers 95% of an employee\u2019s hourly basic salary,\nand is disbursed to companies for employer-sponsored training upon\napplication.\n\nIn response, Minister Teo provided the required data, i.e. over the past five\nyears, an average of around 3,000 companies and 31,000 workers have benefited\nfrom absentee payroll funding each year under the WTS) Scheme. The average\namount disbursed yearly is about S$6 million.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the disbursement is below:\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/08103808/disbursement-breakdown.jpg)\n\n\n\nFurther, below are the industry sectors with the most number of companies\nbenefiting from absentee payroll funding (broadly sectors with a higher\nproportion of low-wage workers):\n\n  * Administrative and support service activities (1,228 unique companies from 2010-2018) \n    * Examples include cleaning, security and landscape services\n  * Manufacturing (1,184 unique companies from 2010-2018)\n  * Accommodation and food service activities (1,130 unique companies from 2010-2018)\n  * Wholesale trade (874 unique companies from 2010-2018)\n  * Other service activities (847 unique companies from 2010-2018) \n    * Examples include hairdressing, beauty and other personal care services.\n\n* * *\n\n### Employment discrimination based on religious wear\n\nMP Assoc Prof Walter Theseira raised queries about the refusal by employers in\nthe retail sector to interview and/or hire a qualified job applicant on\n[grounds that he or she wears articles of religious\nfaith](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-questions-and-\nreplies/2020/0106-written-answer-by-mrs-josephine-teo-minister-for-manpower-\nto-pq-on-employment-discrimination), and whether such actions constitute an\nemployment violation.\n\nMinister Teo clarified that all employers are expected to abide by the\nprinciples of fair employment practices set out in the Tripartite Guidelines\non Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP), which make it clear that recruitment and\nhiring practices are to be based on merit and the ability to perform the job.\n\nShe affirmed: \"Religious wear should generally be allowed at workplaces,\nunless employers have uniform or dress code requirements which are suited to\nthe nature of their work, or for operational and safety reasons.\"\n\nIn the past five years, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive\nEmployment Practices (TAFEP) received 16 complaints around the wearing of\nreligious articles (less than 1% of all the complaints received). Most of\nthem, she said, arose due to insensitivity on the part of the employer or\ninterviewer in communicating company\u2019s dress code and practices.\n\n\"All the employers have heeded TAFEP\u2019s advice and made the necessary\nrectifications to their employment practices,\" she noted.\n\nAlso on the topic of discrimination, MP Theseira asked about [feedback\nexercises with workers filing\ndiscrimination](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-questions-and-\nreplies/2020/0106-written-answer-by-mrs-josephine-teo-minister-for-manpower-\nto-pq-on-feedback-exercises) or workplace harassment reports and their\nsatisfaction with follow-up action taken.\n\nTo this, Minister Teo shared that TAFEP continues to investigate all\ncomplaints received. Where warranted, cases are referred to the Ministry of\nManpower (MOM).\n\n\"Where action has been taken against the employer, TAFEP will keep the\ncomplainant updated on the outcome. Many have been thankful and appreciative\nof the help and support to address their concerns,\" she added.\n\n* * *\n\n### Correlation of private sector bonuses with civil service bonuses\n\nTo MP Leon Perera's question on [tracking private sector\nbonuses](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-questions-and-\nreplies/2020/0106-written-answer-by-mrs-josephine-teo-minister-for-manpower-\nto-pq-on-private-sector-bonuses), Minister Teo shared that the performance of\ncompanies themselves and individuals were employers\u2019 main considerations when\ndetermining private sector bonuses, as shared in MOM's 2018 report.\n\n\"These factors are not affected by civil service bonuses,\" she clarified.\n\n* * *\n\n### Malaysians working in Singapore\n\nThe focus of MP Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar's question was around [the number of\nMalaysian workers working in\nSingapore](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-questions-and-\nreplies/2020/0106-written-answer-by-mrs-josephine-teo-minister-for-manpower-\nto-pq-on-malaysian-wp-holders), and the sectors they are employed in.\n\nTo this, Minister Teo affirmed, that while MOM publishes annual statistics on\nlocal and foreign workforce numbers, \"however, MOM does not provide a\nbreakdown of the number of foreign workers by nationality as it is not in\nSingapore\u2019s interest to do so.\"\n\nShe went on to provide more details: \"Malaysian workers can be found across\nall sectors. This is not surprising, since our work pass framework allows\nMalaysian workers in all sectors, subject to the respective sector\u2019s\nDependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) controls.\"\n\n* * *\n\n### Food delivery riders' transition to using PMD alternatives\n\nMP Rahayu Mahzam inquired about the [efforts made to work with food delivery\ncompanies to provide job search support for delivery\nriders](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-questions-and-\nreplies/2020/0106-written-answer-by-mrs-josephine-teo-minister-for-manpower-\nto-pq-on-malaysians-working-in-sg) affected by the PMD ban.\n\n\"Various Government agencies worked together with the National Trades Union\nCongress (NTUC) and food delivery companies to come up with the Transition\nAssistance Package, or TAP for short, to help food delivery riders transition\nto using alternatives to e-scooters, or to other jobs,\" said Minister Teo.\n\nHowever, since riders do not need to inform the food delivery companies when\nthey have decided to stop taking deliveries, there is no clear-cut way to\ntrack the number of affected riders who have become unemployed.\n\nInstead, the Minister has been proactively reach out to those who may be\nlooking for other jobs. For instance, Workforce Singapore (WSG) and NTUC's\nEmployment and Employability Institute (e2i) have deployed career coaches on-\nsite at food delivery companies on more than 70 occasions, and have organised\na curated job fair to assist affected riders. The food delivery companies have\nbeen disseminating information on these career events to their riders.\n\nMinister Teo shared that to date, more than 180 affected riders have\napproached WSG and NTUC\u2019s e2i for job search support.\n\n* * *\n\n### Securing jobs for Singaporeans through the ITMs\n\nThe [jobs created by the 23 Industry Transformation Maps\n(ITMs)](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-questions-and-\nreplies/2020/0106-oral-answer-by-mr-zaqy-mohamad-mos-for-manpower-to-pq-on-\nitms), and the number of new jobs filled by Singaporeans, PRs and foreigners,\nwas the topic of MP Pritam Singh's question to Minister Zaqy Mohamad, Minister\nof State for Manpower.\n\nFor context, the 23 ITMs were launched progressively from late 2016, with the\nmajority launched only in 2018. While changes in workforce profile depend on\nstructural and cyclical factors, Minister Zaqy noted it will be more\nmeaningful to look at employment outcomes over the medium to longer term.\n\nAs such, between 2015 and 2018 (i.e. before the launch of ITMs, to 2018),\ntotal employment (excluding foreign domestic workers) in these sectors grew by\n19,500. This was made up of:\n\n  * Increase in employment of Singapore Citizens (SCs) by 39,300;\n  * Increase in employment of Permanent Residents (PRs) by 8,600; and\n  * Decrease in employment of foreigners by 28,500.\n\nWithin the same period, the training participation rate of the resident labour\nforce aged 15 to 64 increased from 35% to 48%. From 2016 until September 2019,\nWSG and e2i have also helped 93,000 locals move into new jobs through the\nAdapt & Grow initiative.\n\nHe elaborated: \"These numbers are encouraging because we have been making the\neffort to secure jobs for Singaporeans. We are making progress on this front.\"\n\n_Photo /[123RF](https://www.123rf.com/)_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

Therefore, any delay in payout constitutes a violation.\n\nEmployers must also ensure workers receive the full amount of their wages for\na specific pay period based on their prior agreement. An employer cannot\nreduce a worker's pay without written consent.\n\nBut businesses that expect to see a negative financial impact from the\ncoronavirus outbreak will also need to prepare a compensation strategy that\nresponds to the challenges of a market downturn.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/038/0223_637215290728643929.jpg)](/nz/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/flexible-work-from-the-new-normal-to-the-new-necessary/218904)\n\n#### [Flexible Work: from the new normal to the new\nnecessary](/nz/specialisation/employee-engagement/flexible-work-from-the-new-\nnormal-to-the-new-necessary/218904)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/038/0248_637217770659097647.jpg)](/nz/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/its-never-been-more-important-to-listen-to-employees/219018)\n\n#### ['It's never been more important to listen to\nemployees'](/nz/specialisation/employee-engagement/its-never-been-more-\nimportant-to-listen-to-employees/219018)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637213360039891507.jpg)](/nz/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218601)\n\n#### [COVID-19: HR's main challenges revealed](/nz/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218601)\n\nCompanies that need to change the schedule of their payout and the\nremuneration package of their employees will need to secure their employees'\nconsent in writing first, before they can implement such changes.\n\n[READ MORE: Coronavirus: Can you request medical info from an employee's\ndoctor?](https://www.hcamag.com/nz/news/general/coronavirus-can-you-request-\nmedical-info-from-an-employees-doctor/215853)\n\n**Pandemics and the 'force majeure' clause**  \nAs a general rule, employers in New Zealand must compensate those on their\npayroll who are ready, willing and able to be deployed - even if there is no\nwork to be assigned.\n\nBut because of the unique challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, some\ncompanies may have the leeway not to pay their employees under certain\nscenarios.\n\nEmployers may be released from their contractual obligations, such as having\nto pay workers or continue their employment, if their contract contains a\n'force majeure' clause. That is, when an extrinsic event such as a pandemic\n\"renders the employment agreement impossible to perform,\" employment lawyers\nfrom Buddle Findlay advise.\n\nAnderson Lloyd Lawyers recommend being open and communicative with employees\nas businesses navigate their way in these uncertain times.\n\n\"If an employer can't sustain an employee because there is no work, or they\nare suffering financially from the effects of coronavirus, there is no\nobligation to maintain that employment,\" the law firm notes. \"However, an\nemployer's good faith obligations require a fair process to be carried out and\n\nconsultation in good faith.\"\n\n**Know more about your rights and duties as an employer through the HRD\nEmployment Law Masterclass.

In a situation\nwhere all that is required for work is a computer and internet connectivity,\nis it necessary for people to come a physical location every day to work?\n\nFor instance,  [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/240929/workplace-\nleaders-learn-real-gig-economy.aspx), reports that 36% of U.S. workers were\ninvolved in the gig economy in 2018 and\n[McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Employment%20and%20Growth/Independent%20work%20Choice%20necessity%20and%20the%20gig%20economy/Independent-\nWork-Choice-necessity-and-the-gig-economy-Executive-Summary.ashx) notes than\nbetween 20-30% of workers in the EU is involved in the gig economy.\nInterestingly, a [T. Rowe Price Group's\nsurvey](https://www.troweprice.com/corporate/en/press/t--rowe-price--the-\nmajority-of-independent-workers-are-actively-.html) showed that 26% of\nmillennials believe that the gig economy offers more security than traditional\nemployment. Also, [Intuit](https://http-\ndownload.intuit.com/http.intuit/CMO/intuit/futureofsmallbusiness/intuit_2020_report.pdf)\nreveals that 80% of large U.S companies plan to adopt a flexible workforce of\nnon-traditional workers from 2020 onwards.\n\n![Remote Workforce](https://d2gr5kl7dt2z3t.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/09154521/Remote-Workforce.jpg)\n\nMore importantly, migration has become a sensitive political topic and it\nperhaps has the biggest effect on where labor lives and works. Talent is\nevenly distributed but opportunity is not. However, demographic shift,\ntechnological advancement, globalization, and deeper internet penetration are\nopening the doors of opportunities across borders. This piece explores some of\nthe challenges with managing payments for global workers.\n\n**The challenges of managing payroll in a global economy**\n\nAs employees becoming increasingly independent, and companies move more and\nmore to a remote or de-centralized model the process of managing payments for\nsuch workers or employees poses serious challenges to many organizations. To\nstart with, the traditional global banking industry is fragmented even though\nregional blocs are working towards a centralized financial system. Also,\ngovernment regulations in relation to applicable taxes for employers and their\nemployees vary across jurisdictions.\n\nThe performance of the traditional payroll companies especially in the wake of\nCovid-19 suggests traditional payroll solutions might struggle to keep up with\nthe new realities of work. Whilst [companies specializing in remote worker\npayments](https://papayaglobal.com) are set to benefit from this 'new world of\nwork', the poor stock performance of publicly traded payroll companies in the\nyear-to-date period indicates the markets lack of confidence in their\nsolutions for the gig or remote workforce economies.\n\n![](https://d2gr5kl7dt2z3t.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/09154644/YCharts-Remote-Workforce.png)\n\nPaychex Inc ([NASDAQ:PAYX](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PAYX/)) serves\nsmall and mid-sized businesses on the U.S and Germany with a range of HR,\npayroll, and benefits outsourcing services. In the year-to-date period, the\nstock is down 3.51%; however, this stock had gain 17.18% in the same period in\n2019.\n\nInsperity Inc ([NYSE:NSP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NSP/)) also provides\nHR (including payroll and financial management) outsourcing services to small\nand medium-sized businesses through bundled cloud and native software\nofferings. In the year-to-date period, the stock is down a massive 24.71%;\nconversely, it had gained more than 30% in the same period last year.\n\nTrinet Group Inc ([NYSE:TNET](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TNET/)) serves\nsmall and medium-sized businesses with HR, payroll, and benefits management\nsoftware applications. In the YTD, its stock is down 4.86% whereas the stock\nwas up by more than 42% in the same period in 2019.\n\nSAP SE ([NYSE:SAP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SAP/)) provides\ncorporations with enterprise software solutions for managing human capital. In\nthe year-to-date period, the stock is down 9.33% but it was up 8.46% in the\nsame period in 2019.\n\nWorkday Inc ([NYSE:WDAY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WDAY/)) delivers\ndifferent kinds of analytics, human capital management, and financial capital\nmanagement solutions to businesses. In the year-to-date period, the trading\nprice of the stock has declined by 3.51% but it had gained 13.71% in the same\nperiod in 2019.\n\n![](https://d2gr5kl7dt2z3t.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/09154757/YCharts-Remote-Workforce-2.png)\n\nAutomatic Data Processing Inc.\n([NASDAQ:ADP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADP/)), is perhaps the most\npopular publicly traded payroll company. It provides a suite of human capital\nmanagement solutions for compliance, benefits, and payroll administration. In\nthe YTD, the stock is down 6.66% but it had gained 13.82% in the same period\nlast year.\n\nIn contrast, Zoom Communications Inc\n([NASDAQ:ZM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZM/)) which provided enterprise\nvideo communications solutions has been seen it's stock outperforming the\ngeneral equities market. In the year-to-date period, (chart above) Zoom's\nstock is up more than 68% as more businesses continue turn to its products for\nvideo, audioconferencing, chat, and collaborations instead of being in the\nsame physical location.\n\nAlso, the shares of Slack Technologies Inc.\n([NYSE:WORK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WORK/)), has also been on a\nwinning streak that contrasts with the general direction of the market. Slack\nprovides enterprise collaboration solutions for real-time chat, archiving,\nfile sharing, collaboration, and team organization. The 17.53% gain in its\nstock suggests that more businesses are looking towards flexible remote work\ninstead of the traditional centralized model.\n\nTo bring it all home, the uptrend it stocks of firms promoting flexible work\nsuggests that the future of work will continue to lean towards\ndecentralization. Hence, traditional payroll solutions built specifically for\nU.S and EU markets might be inadequate when businesses start to tap into the\nglobal talent pool.\n\n**Challenges facing the traditional payroll industry**\n\nThe traditional solutions for managing payroll for international workers might\nprove inadequate when needed to be deployed at scale across multiple\njurisdictions as the future of work continue to be decentralized.\n\nFor one, the fact that an increasingly large number of employees now choose to\nlive and work in different countries mean that payroll solutions must be\ndesigned to comply with local payroll and labor laws in different parts of the\nworld. While many of the traditional payroll solutions are compliant with US\nand EU regulations, employers need to start thinking about being compliant\nwith information on salary benchmarks, regulations, and benefits for employees\noutside the traditional labor markets of the EU and U.S.\n\nSecondly, some traditional payroll workaround such as putting international\nemployees on the payroll of a local affiliate or ignoring the labor laws of\nthe host countries during short stints abroad could be borderline illegal and\nsubject the employer to serious legal and regulatory risk.\n\nThirdly, leasing or assigning foreign employees to a local company who then\ninvoices the home company for managing the payroll might be harder to\nreplicate at scale when you have a handful of employees in different countries\nor digital nomads who only spend a couple of month in a country before moving\nto another country.\n\nAlso, it is hard to justifying paying a global talent as an independent\ncontractor especially if the \"contractor\" has set work hours, receives\nperformance evaluations and benefits. This might also post some regulatory\nrisks in the home country of the supposed \"contractor\" holds an executive\nposition and is featured in the corporate organogram.\n\n**Conclusion: The future of work**\n\nChange in the new constant and the future of work is potentially predictably\nunpredictable. Based on the growth of the gig economy over the last decade,\nthere's a high chance that the future of work will become more independent.\nEmployees will gradually opt to work like consultants and contractors rather\nthan follow the traditional 9-5 mode of employment.\n\nInterestingly, employers who are quick to understand and accept the paradigm\nshift in how people work will be better off competitively than companies that\nare averse to change. Nonetheless, payroll will continue to be key finance\nmechanism as employers are forced to work with employees living in different\ncountries.\n\n[ Share\n](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insidermonkey.com%2Fblog%2Fcrucial-\nconversations-on-managing-payroll-effectively-for-a-remote-\nworkforce-818343%2F) [ Tweet\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insidermonkey.com%2Fblog%2Fcrucial-\nconversations-on-managing-payroll-effectively-for-a-remote-\nworkforce-818343%2F) [\nEmail](mailto:?subject=From%20InsiderMonkey.com%3A%20Crucial+Conversations+on+Managing+Payroll+Effectively+for+a+Remote+Workforce&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.insidermonkey.com%2Fblog%2Fcrucial-\nconversations-on-managing-payroll-effectively-for-a-remote-\nworkforce-818343%2F)\n\n## DOWNLOAD FREE REPORT: Warren Buffett's Best Stock Picks\n\n![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/imonkey/img/Warren-Buffett-300x400.png)\n\nLet Warren Buffett, George Soros, Steve Cohen, and Daniel Loeb WORK FOR YOU.  \n  \nIf you want to beat the low cost index funds by 19 percentage points per year,\nlook no further than our monthly newsletter.In this free report you can find\nan in-depth analysis of the performance of Warren Buffett's entire historical\nstock picks.

smaller companies can still gain\nthe benefits of sleek and easy-to-use HR platforms.\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | June 17, 2019\n\nTopics: [Asia-Pacific](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/apac/) |\n[Compensation and\nBenefits](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/benefitsandcompensation/) | [HR\nTechnology](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/hrtechnology/) | [Southeast\nAsia](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/asean/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-991097114.jpg)\n\n\n\n_RenQun Huang of Gpayroll highlights how smaller companies can still gain the\nbenefits of sleek and easy-to-use HR platforms._\n\n### **What is Gpayroll\u2019s mission in the area of HR?**\n\nWe\u2019re on a long-term mission to redefine and revolutionise the payroll\nindustry by changing what ought to be a manual and complex task in a\nmeaningful way.\n\nPayroll is complex, tedious, time consuming and doesn\u2019t add value to growing\nyour business - but it is essential. This is the problem that we want to\nsolve, especially so for SMEs, who may not be able to afford enterprise\nsoftware for their payroll needs.\n\nBusiness owners need to watch out for payroll errors and declaring taxable\nincome incorrectly as this can result in hefty penalty fees. Payroll software\ncan minimise errors and streamlines the payroll processes.\n\n### **Who would benefit most from your technology?**\n\nSME business owners, HR professionals and accountants benefit the most from\nour software. Every business needs payroll. There are also business\noutsourcing providers who provide payroll outsourcing services.\n\nOur software is affordable, easy to use and scalable. This fits in to SMEs who\nare tight on budget. Payroll is already stressful enough for HR professionals,\naccountants and they just need the software to be user friendly.\n\nInstead of them trying to get the software to work, it should be the other way\nround. Our software works its way out for them automatically, allowing them to\nenjoy a peace of mind.\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/05/2KW_1893.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/05/2KW_1893.jpg)\n\n_Gpayroll at the HR Festival Asia PitchFest_\n\n### **How does it stand out from the crowd?**\n\nMost payroll solutions in the market today solve only half the burden by\nproviding calculations only. This is where Gpayroll stands out. It covers not\nonly payroll calculations but also automates provident funds, tax filings (\n[AutoFiling](https://gpayroll.com/blog/payroll/guide-how-does-autowage-\nautofiling-actually-works.html)) and salary disbursement\n([AutoWage](https://gpayroll.com/blog/payroll/guide-how-does-autowage-\nautofiling-actually-works.html)).\n\nThe time saving from payroll administration can be used to work on improving\nemployee benefits and engagement. This helps to maintain a very healthy\nrelationship between the employee and the employer.\n\nFor business outsourcing providers, our software ensures that their clients\u2019\nemployees are paid on time. Payroll process is automated by schedule and\nregulatory updates are handled automatically in the background.\n\n### **You recently emerged tops at the inaugural HR Festival Asia PitchFest.\nWhat was that experience like?**\n\nIt was been a great experience. It is exciting to see the rise of HR Tech\nspace with great ideas coming from the startups. It also gave us the\nopportunity to make new friends, as well as catching up with existing ones in\nthe HR community.\n\nAt the same time, we are proud to be the winner of the HR Festival Asia\nPitchFest.\n\nWe have done several pitching in previous conferences but not in the HR space.\nOur past experiences enabled us to fine tune and polish our skill and [HR\nFestival PitchFest](http://hrmasia.com/g-payroll-takes-home-the-biggest-prize-\nat-the-hr-tech-pitchfest/) was a perfect opportunity for us to showcase our\nsolution to the HR community. We want to thank HRM Asia for giving us the\nopportunity.\n\n### **What is the in the future for Gpayroll?**\n\nWe grow together with our clients and this means that as our clients grow,\nthey will need a more comprehensive solution to cater to their payroll & HR\nneeds. As such, we are introducing new online HR modules that are integrated\nwith the existing solutions.\n\nThis provides a seamless payroll and HR experience in a single platform for\nits clients.\n\nPresently, most of our clients are SMEs. However, we are also looking to work\nwith multi-national corporations that need a regional platform to support\ntheir payroll and HR needs.\n\nGpayroll is present in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, China,\nTaiwan, Macau, South Korea and is looking at expanding to other countries such\nas Japan and Indonesia in the near future.\n\n* * *\n\n### _For more information about Gpayroll, head over\nto<https://www.gpayroll.com/>_\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fredefining-\npayroll-in-asia-pacific%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+Gpayroll+is+redefining+payroll+in+Asia-\nPacific&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fredefining-payroll-in-asia-\npacific%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fredefining-\npayroll-in-asia-pacific%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

[According to the World Health\nOrganization](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd\n\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd\"),\nas of March 20, 2020, there are 209,839 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 168\nterritories and countries. According to Johns Hopkins, the United States [has\n14,250 confirmed\ncases](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\n\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\")\nwith reported cases in every state.\n\nAs a result of the virus, state, local, and federal government officials have\ninstituted varying degrees of voluntary and mandatory quarantines. The impact\nhas been felt immediately by businesses.\n\nIn response, Congress has proposed several bills, including the most recent\none introduced by Senate Republican leadership and dubbed the \"Coronavirus\nAid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\" or the \"CARES Act.\"  Here are some of\nthe highlights:\n\nToday In: [Taxes](https://www.forbes.com/taxes)\n\n  * [\n\n### Ask Larry: Will My Social Security Benefits Be Reduced If I Earn $12,000\nThis Year?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kotlikoff/2020/04/07/ask-larry-will-my-social-\nsecurity-benefits-be-reduced-if-i-earn-12000-this-year/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Free Money For Small Business? Beware Legal Risks Of Paycheck Protection\nLoan Program Until More Guidance Issued\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucebrumberg/2020/04/06/free-money-for-small-\nbusiness-beware-legal-risks-of-paycheck-protection-loan-program-until-more-\nguidance-issued/)\n\n  * [\n\n### COVID-19 Could Bankrupt Your State\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2020/04/06/covid-19-could-\nbankrupt-your-state/)\n\n **Stimulus Checks.**  The bill would provide checks called \"recovery rebates\"\nto taxpayers. Unlike rebate checks in the past, which tended to be flat per\ntaxpayer or family, the current bill would vary according to family income.\nThe bill would allow for checks of up to $1,200 per adult - or $2,400 for\nmarried couples filing jointly - as well as $500 per child. All taxpayers must\nprovide a Social Security number or adoption taxpayer identification number.\n\nAnd here's where things get tricky: taxpayers must typically be working or\nreceiving Social Security or pension income to qualify since the amounts are\ntied to tax returns. The amount of the checks would start to phaseout for\nthose earning more than $75,000 ($150,000 for joint returns) and would\ndisappear entirely for those earning more than $99,000. Those families at the\nbottom - those with no federal income tax liability - would receive less\nmoney, but no less than $600. Checks would be paid out \"as rapidly as\npossible.\"\n\nAnd since I know many folks have asked: under the bill as written, checks\nwould not be subject to reduction or offset.\n\n**Filing Deadlines.**  The bill would push off the filing (yes, FILING)\ndeadline for individual 2019 tax returns to July 15, 2020 - but that is moot\nsince the filing deadline was [officially\nextended](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/20/irs-pushes-\nfiling-and-payment-deadlines-to-july-15/#4aba9b5f23e2\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/20/irs-pushes-filing-\nand-payment-deadlines-to-july-15/#4aba9b5f23e2\") on March 20, 2020. However,\nthe bill would also extend the due date for estimated payments for 2020 to\nOctober 15, 2020, and would treat ALL estimated payments due through October\n15, 2020, as \"one installment due on such date.\" In other words, there would\nbe no need to write separate checks for the skipped April and July estimated\npayment dates if the proposal passes.\n\n**Small Business Interruption Loans.  **The bill would expand the eligibility\nfor certain small businesses (those under 500 employees) to receive a loan of\nup to $10 million under the Small Business Act. Loans could be used for\npayroll support, including paid sick, medical, or family leave, and costs\nrelated to the continuation of group health care benefits; employee salaries;\nmortgage payments and rent; utilities; and other debts. Loans used to cover\npayroll could be forgiven if businesses retain employees through June 30,\n2020. Funds used to pay tipped employees, such as bars and restaurants, may be\neligible for loan forgiveness if they are used to provide additional wages.\n\n**Special Rules for Retirement Accounts.**  The bill would allow for tax-\nfavored \"coronavirus-related\" distributions from certain retirement plans of\nup to $100,000. Qualifying taxpayers would also be allowed to repay their\nretirement plans to make up for money withdrawn to pay coronavirus-related\nexpenses (including loans and distributions).\n\n**Charitable Contributions Move Above The Line.  **In what I think might be a\nfirst, the bill would provide that certain charitable contributions be treated\nas above-the-line. That means that you would not have to itemize to claim\nthose deductions - something that [many taxpayers have grappled\nwith](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/11/14/the-gifts-that-\nkeep-on-giving-5-strategies-to-tax-optimize-charitable-giving/#449b732c26fe\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2019/11/14/the-gifts-that-keep-\non-giving-5-strategies-to-tax-optimize-charitable-giving/#449b732c26fe\")\nbecause of the increased standard deduction under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n(TCJA) that took effect in 2018. Under the provisions in the bill, the benefit\ncouldn't exceed $300 and wouldn't apply to donor-advised funds.\n\n**Charitable Contribution Limits.**  The bill would also temporarily suspend\nthe limits under section 170(b) and (d) on cash donations for individuals and\nmodifies limits for charitable contributions from corporations. Restrictions\napply (of course).\n\n**Corporate Tax Payment Delays.**  Corporations get extra time to file and\npay, too. The bill would extend the time to pay estimated payments (same\ntreatment as individuals) and payroll taxes through October 15, 2020. And yes,\nthe extension for payroll tax would apply to the employer portion of self-\nemployment taxes, too.\n\n**Net Operating Losses.**  Taxpayers and tax professionals weren't big fans of\nthe TCJA provision limiting net operating losses. Those provisions would be\nmodified under the bill, allowing for carry-forwards and carry-backs (!) to\n2018. Lots (and lots) of limitations and restrictions would apply.\n\n**Bailouts.**  The bill includes up to $208,000,000,0000 for loans and loan\nguarantees to severely distressed sectors of the economy. Those sectors\ninclude passenger and cargo air carriers and \"other eligible businesses.\"\nLimits apply, including restrictions on paying certain highly-compensated\nemployees.\n\n**Aviation Excise Taxes.**  Travelers could get a break, too. The bill would\nsuspend certain federal aviation excise taxes through the end of the year. You\nmay not write a separate check for those taxes, but you do pay them - just\ncheck your tickets.\n\n**COVID-19 Testing and Treatment.  **With costs for testing and treatment\nstill a concern, the bill would require group health plans and health\ninsurance issuers offering group or individual health insurance to cover\npreventive services for the virus. It would also require diagnostic test\nproviders for COVID-19 to make the cash price for the test available to the\npublic on the internet.\n\n**Inclusion of Certain Over-The-Counter Medical Products As Qualified Medical\nExpenses.**  As a woman, I cheer this provision, but as a tax professional,\nI'm perplexed by the timing. The bill would consider amounts paid for\nmenstrual care products as paid for medical care. That would include \"a\ntampon, pad, liner, cup, sponge, or similar product used by individuals with\nrespect to menstruation or other genital-tract secretions.\" You already know\nhow I feel about this, I'm sure (you can read [my tampon-hoarding piece\nhere](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/02/13/lawmakers-\nworry-that-sales-tax-exemption-means-women-will-buy-too-many-\ntampons/#6f5f4ab6f93c\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/02/13/lawmakers-worry-\nthat-sales-tax-exemption-means-women-will-buy-too-many-\ntampons/#6f5f4ab6f93c\")), because we are certainly not buying menstrual\nproducts for kicks - it's a medical thing - but the inclusion in *this* bill\nis odd. But, here we are, so I'm not complaining. The bill would extend the\nqualifying medical expenses treatment for menstrual products to Archer Medical\nSavings Accounts, Health Flexible Spending Arrangements, Health Reimbursement\nArrangement - your basic healthcare alphabet soup: MSAs, HSAs, HRAs and the\nlike.\n\n**Current Students.  **I know many of you scrolled down just to read this bit\n(do yourself a favor and scroll back up, just in case), but several provisions\nin the bill apply to student loans. And honestly, they're the most complicated\n(yes, more than airline bailout provisions). But here's the gist. First,\ncolleges and universities are allowed to award \"emergency financial aid\ngrants\" without regard to the usual need calculation; the amount of the grant\ncan't exceed the applicable Pell grant for the same year. The bill would also\nallow some payments to be made to students with work-study arrangements if\nthey weren't able to finish their work during the year because of the virus\n(including virus-related closings).\n\nThe bill also allows the Department of Education to exclude some loans for\nstudents who were unable to remain enrolled in school as a result of a\nqualifying emergency (exceptions apply). Waivers also apply to Pell Grant\nrepayments under the same circumstances. The details will probably have to be\nfinessed, but this is clearly intended for students who were forced to\nwithdraw and did not receive credit for attendance but paid unreimbursed\ntuition and expenses with loans.\n\n**Suspension Of Student Loans.**  The bill also provides that payments due for\nstudent loans shall be suspended - without interest - for three months.\n\n**Corrections and Modifications.**  The bill also offers revisions and\nmodifications to existing paid leave bills, including the Family and Medical\nLeave Act and the spanking new Families First Coronavirus Response Act.\n\nWAIT! Before you run out and share, keep in mind that this is just a bill -\nand it's my first read of the bill. It's long and dense. Senate Finance\nCommittee Chair Charles Grassley (R-IA) said, \"These recommendations take bold\nsteps to curb the economic fallout as we work as a country to contain this\npandemic. These recommendations won't be the end of the congressional response\nto the coronavirus.\"\n\nBut some in Congress worry that the bill offers a lot, but is not focused on\nassisting those who need it most. Even Republicans voiced skepticism about the\nMcConnell-introduced plan. Two Senators, in particular, suggested that the\ntiming is off. Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-SC) isn't yet on board, saying that the\nchecks won't do much to help at this point; Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.)\nreportedly agrees.\n\nYou can read the [latest version of the bill\nhere](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s3548/BILLS-116s3548is.pdf\n\"https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s3548/BILLS-116s3548is.pdf\") \\- but settle\nin - it's 247 pages long.\n\nThis bill is in addition to H.R. 6201,  _Families First Coronavirus Response\nAct,_  which cleared the House last week and [passed in the\nSenate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/18/senate-\npasses-houses-coronavirus-relief-bill-president-expected-to-sign/#561b173635a8\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/18/senate-passes-\nhouses-coronavirus-relief-bill-president-expected-to-sign/#561b173635a8\") this\nweek. It guarantees free testing or health care coverage for coronavirus\ntesting, and provides paid sick leave for some workers and offers additional\nfunding for seniors, food assistance, and unemployment benefits. You can read\nmore about the highlights of the bill in our prior coverage\n[here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/14/house-bill-\nwould-allow-for-paid-leave-testing--tax-credits-to-lessen-impact-of-\ncoronavirus/#14fc94d35207\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2020/03/14/house-bill-would-\nallow-for-paid-leave-testing--tax-credits-to-lessen-impact-of-\ncoronavirus/#14fc94d35207\"). The President signed the bill into law on\nWednesday, March 18, 2020.\n\nIt's also in addition to the $8.3 billion emergency health package, which was\npassed earlier this month. This most recent bill focuses explicitly on\neconomic aid for workers.\n\nClearly, things are happening at a rapid-fire pace these days. As tax updates\nbecome available, we'll keep you updated. **Keep checking back for details.**\n\n **[Full coverage and live updates on the\nCoronavirus](https://www.forbes.com/coronavirus/)**\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@taxgirl) or\n[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/taxgirl/).

It was a horrible experience. In a desperate\nattempt to avoid anything like that in the future, I enrolled in a tax course.\nI loved it. I signed up for another. Before I knew it, in addition to my JD, I\nearned an LL.M Taxation. While at law school, I interned at the estates\nattorney division of the IRS. At IRS, I participated in the review and audit\nof federal estate tax returns. At one such audit, opposing counsel read my\nreport, looked at his file and said, \"Gentlemen, she\u2019s exactly right.\" I\nnearly fainted. It was a short jump from there to practicing, teaching,\nwriting and breathing tax.

If the members of this\nteam are overwhelmed or don't have the resources they need to perform their\njobs, the entire organization will suffer. Fortunately, such a thing as HRIS\nsystems exists.\n\n**What are the types of HRIS systems?**  \nHuman resource information system (HRIS) refers to a software solution used in\nmanaging employees and in the procedures for keeping them engaged and\nproductive. HRIS systems typically fall into two categories, according to\nMitrefinch:\n\n**HCM**  \nThe systems that fall under the human capital management (HCM) category are\naimed at recruiting and retaining employees throughout their life cycle. They\ncan include anything from recruitment and onboarding tools to salary planning,\nbudgeting, goal-setting, and performance assessment. These tools assist the HR\nteam in guiding employees toward success.\n\nAnalytics are also an integral part of HCM solutions and can be useful in\ntracking employee red flags and predicting growth potential. These solutions\ntend to be more detailed than HRMS solutions and are often used in an\nexecutive-type white-collar setting.\n\n**HRMS**  \nHuman resource management systems (HRMS) may contain some elements of HCM\nsolutions, but they also have several tools to help employees as well. These\ninclude an efficient and flexible way for workers to clock in and out, manage\ntheir schedules, and easily communicate with colleagues even if they are\nworking remotely.\n\nOn the HR side, these solutions can be integrated into payroll and onboarding\nprocesses to make tasks easier for the HR team. They can also lessen the\nnumber of mistakes and improve the oversight that can be made with a manual\nprocess.\n\n**What are the components of HRIS systems?**  \nHRIS typically has six components, according to Bizfluent:\n\n**Company database**  \nAn essential HRIS system component is a database where all pieces of\ninformation about employees and company HR procedures will be stored for use\nin other HRIS tools. Aside from conveniently storing all data in a central\nlocation for easy access, this database comes with features to keep your data\nsecure, updated, and free from corruption.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\nAutomated backups are a common feature that HRIS systems use to prevent data\nloss. Often, there's also access to technical support in case you have trouble\naccessing your data or experience an emergency.\n\n**Financial components**  \nHRIS also includes components for handling payroll, benefits, and employee\nrecognition programs. The payroll and benefits components will maintain\ninformation such as salary rates, commission and incentive plans, payment\naccounts, and paycheck deductions (e.g., taxes, retirement plans, and\ninsurance options).\n\nUsually, there are options to automate payouts, calculate taxes, and enroll in\nbenefits. If your organization rewards employees with bonuses or gift cards\nfor great work, financial components have reporting tools that can help\ndetermine these rewards.\n\n**Time and attendance**  \nAnother key HRIS component helps with keeping track of the time during which\nemployees work and any incidents of absence or tardiness. Such information can\nbe sent to the financial components to ensure that employees are paid fairly.\n\nAlso, these tools can automate employee scheduling, send managers alerts when\nattendance problems occur, and allow for documentation of time off and\nextended leave requests. Some systems even make it possible for employees to\nclock in remotely and support biometrics options.\n\n**Recruitment and onboarding**  \nHRIS systems come with components that ease the work done throughout the\nhiring process, including posting job applications, handling employee\nreferrals, sending interview requests, and tracking applicants. Often, you can\naccess applicant profiles, record notes from job interviews, conduct\nemployment tests, perform background checks, and send job-offer letters.\n\nOnce employees are hired, there are tools that can automate onboarding\nactivities such as document signing, new employee record keeping, and\ncompliance administration.\n\n**Employee management**  \nYou can use this component to track employee performance, make changes to\nemployees' personal information, document feedback from performance reviews,\nand maintain information about salary, benefits, and disciplinary history.\n\n**Training and development**  \nMost HRIS systems provide an option to design a training path for employees\nand even integrate training courses, tests, and professional certification\npreparation in a portal that employees can easily access. They also record\nemployees' progress and can even use work performance metrics to check whether\nthe training has helped employees improve and assign additional training\nexercises as needed.\n\nSince these tools can support employee ranking, they come in handy when\nconsidering which workers to promote. It's particularly helpful when deciding\nabout succession planning within your organization.\n\n**What are the benefits of HRIS systems?**  \nHere are four ways your organization can benefit from an HRIS, according to\nNamely:\n\n**Employee self-service**  \nAn HRIS stores all your company policies, benefits information, and company\nresources in one accessible location, so employees know exactly where to look\nfor the answers to all their questions. They can connect with colleagues,\nrequest time off, enroll in benefits, and check paystubs on demand from their\nlaptops and mobile devices without interrupting you.\n\n**Centralized employee communication**  \nInternal messages can get lost easily. An HRIS can act as the central hub for\nyour organization's internal communications. Modern HR systems offer a\nnewsfeed where the HR team can post announcements, recognize outstanding\nemployees, and share updates. The platform can also boost employee engagement\nby acknowledging employee birthdays, start dates, and work anniversaries.\n\n**Increased HR automation**  \nAs your organization grows, your time might be better spent on strategic\ninitiatives - not day-to-day administrative tasks. An HRIS can help streamline\nyour daily tasks by automating simple processes such as overseeing employee\nonboarding, benefits enrollment, and tax forms - giving you time to manage\nyour employees and focus on your team's initiatives.\n\n**Powerful people insights**  \nUsing an HRIS enables you to make more strategic decisions. By storing all\nyour company and employee data in one place, you get a more holistic view of\nyour organization and can better identify areas for improvement. Aside from\nHR, payroll and benefits, HR software typically offers powerful integrations\nwith other point solutions to move data seamlessly between systems. Using your\nHR data through consistent reporting not only helps your organization achieve\nits business goals but also empowers you to make more informed decisions and\nprove impact.\n\n**How much is an HRIS system?**  \nHRIS costs can vary from as low as $1 per month per employee to thousands of\ndollars a year. As for huge enterprise HRMS systems like PeopleSoft, SAP,\nSage, and Workday, they may cost larger firms thousands or even millions of\ndollars to implement. Fortunately, newer cloud-based HR software fills the gap\nfor small businesses by offering online HRMS systems that allow employers to\npay by employee or contractor (user) with no setup fee, with price ranging\nfrom about $1 to $15 per month per employee.\n\nWhen choosing an HRIS, these are the costs that you should consider, according\nto FitSmallBusiness:\n\n  * Software - HR software for small business costs between $1 and $15 per month per employee. Some firms add monthly fees, while others provide only the basics.\n  * Setup fees - These are used to pay for the time of configuring the software to a company. Price ranges from zero to thousands per year, depending on the vendor.\n  * Consulting fees - These vary from zero (if included in your software subscription) to about $150 per hour if you seek the help of an outside HR consultant.\n  * Support fees - Some HRMS software companies charge additional support fees that may run a few hundred dollars per year.\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily newsletters\nfrom HRD Asia.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n### Recent articles & video\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637218764030398689.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-\nbreaker-mom-advises-against-prolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: MOM advises against 'prolonged' no-pay\nleave](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-breaker-mom-advises-against-\nprolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218756963772601.jpg)](/asia/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219166)\n\n#### [How has COVID-19 impacted managers and\nemployees?](/asia/news/general/how-has-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-\nemployees/219166)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218753186012580.jpg)](/asia/news/general/ceo-\nof-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-from-a-challenge/219160)\n\n#### [CEO of HP Canada: 'I was never one to shy away from a\nchallenge'](/asia/news/general/ceo-of-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-\nfrom-a-challenge/219160)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217706478717086.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/change-\nmanagement/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-support-employees/219005)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: How can HR support\nemployees?](/asia/specialisation/change-management/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-\nsupport-employees/219005)\n\n### Most Read Articles\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n06 Apr 2020\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n__\n\n  * [HRT](https://www.hrtechnologynews.com/)\n  * [Companies](/asia/companies)\n  * [People](/asia/people)\n  * [Newsletter](/asia/newsletter)\n\n  * [About us](/asia/about-us)\n  * [Authors](/asia/authors)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/asia/privacy-policy)\n  * [Conditions of use](/asia/conditions-of-use)\n  * [Contact us](/asia/contact-us)\n  * [RSS __](/asia/rss)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/HumanResourcesDirectorAsia/)[__](https://twitter.com/HRD_Asia)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/human-\nresources-director-asia)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Key Media ![](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n"}, {"item": "Payroll automation is the next frontier for HR software - Employee Benefit News", "link": "https://www.benefitnews.com/opinion/payroll-automation-is-the-next-frontier-for-hr-software", "guid": "CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbmVmaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL3BheXJvbGwtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1pcy10aGUtbmV4dC1mcm9udGllci1mb3ItaHItc29mdHdhcmXSAQA", "pubdate": "Mon, 24 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.benefitnews.com/opinion/payroll-automation-is-the-next-frontier-for-hr-software\" target=\"_blank\">Payroll automation is the next frontier for HR software</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Employee Benefit News</font>", "source": "Employee Benefit News", "body": "Payroll automation is the next frontier for HR software | Employee Benefit\nNews\n\n  * [Retirement](https://www.benefitnews.com/retirement)\n\n  * [Wellness](https://www.benefitnews.com/wellness)\n\n  * [Voluntary](https://www.benefitnews.com/voluntary)\n\n  * [Dig|HR](https://www.benefitnews.com/dig-hr)\n\n  * [Views](https://www.benefitnews.com/opinion)\n\n  * [Employer Strategies](https://www.benefitnews.com/employer-strategies)\n\n  * More\n\n    * [Events](https://www.benefitnews.com/events)\n    * [Regulation](https://www.benefitnews.com/regulation)\n    * [Insurance](https://www.benefitnews.com/insurance)\n    * [Healthcare](https://www.benefitnews.com/healthcare)\n    * [Resources](https://www.benefitnews.com/resources)\n    * [Events](https://www.benefitnews.com/events)\n    * [Regulation](https://www.benefitnews.com/regulation)\n    * [Insurance](https://www.benefitnews.com/insurance)\n    * [Healthcare](https://www.benefitnews.com/healthcare)\n    * [Resources](https://www.benefitnews.com/resources)\n\nLogin\n\nSign Up\n\n\u00a9 2020 Arizent.

There are multiple advantages to\nstreamlining your HR functions:\n\n**Saves money and time:** The conventional way of implementing HR-related\ntasks, which relies completely on human efforts, consumes a lot of time and\ncalls for a large amount of money. A feature-packed payroll software system,\non the other hand, allows you to set up automated alerts to notify you\nwhenever it identifies any discrepancies. A sophisticated payroll software\nplatform not only helps save tremendous amounts of time over manual payroll\nprocesses but also eliminates human errors rampant in the manual process of\ndata entry or data collection.\n\n**Simplifies wage calculation:** Payroll software solutions replace monotonous\npayroll processes, such as writing checks by hand, calculating different types\nof payments and perusing spreadsheets. Automated payroll software is capable\nof calculating all types of payments, including bonuses, commissions and wage\ndeductions, among others. What's more, it also saves time by generating\npaychecks automatically. However, you should keep in mind that these processes\nare not completely error-free as the accuracy of the generated results relies\non the accuracy of the input.\n\n **Facilitates easy financial planning:** An automated payroll software\ntransfers funds into the payroll account immediately. Since your employees are\nnotified as soon as their paycheck gets deposited to their account, it\neliminates the need for visiting banks. Automated payroll software also\nminimizes the chances of delayed paychecks that weakens the trust of your\nemployees and may also lead to penalties.\n\n **Generates employee satisfaction:** Satisfied employees are crucial for the\nsuccess of your business and are more productive and engaged. For example,\nautomated [_attendance management\nsoftware_](https://www.softwaresuggest.com/us/attendance-management-software)\nmaximizes employee productivity by making sure that leaves and other\nprivileges are properly dispensed. If a manager is unaware when employees are\napplying for PTO, poor leave planning will not only put his/her workforce\nplanning at risk, but will also end up creating manpower shortages on days\nwhen the company is understaffed, thus, overburdening employees and making\nthem dissatisfied.\n\nThe best attendance management software is the one that can be customized as\nper the modification of your business policies. For example, attendance\nmanagement software should allow you to include the different holidays your\ncompany wants to add in addition to the existing official holidays.\n\n **Facilitates accurate timekeeping:** Conventional payroll processes call for\ncalculating hourly wages manually, which is again a time-consuming affair.\nAutomated payroll software can be linked to timesheet systems for recording\nemployee attendance, as well as the total time worked. It automatically\ntransfers data about total hours worked by employees into your payroll system,\nthus simplifying your payroll calculations. It is also capable of making\nnecessary edits when an employee forgets to clock in or out.\n\n **Simplifies tax deduction calculation by minimizing errors:** Tax rules and\nregulations keep changing frequently. Automated payroll software is designed\nto seamlessly calculate taxes for each employee. Consequently, it minimizes\nerrors and saves you from penalties.\n\n **Facilitates easy recordkeeping:** With an automated payroll system, you can\neliminate the need for maintaining tax records manually. Besides generating\nbackups automatically, payroll software is also capable of storing payroll\ndata and employment tax, thus helping you save time and effort.\n\n **Make changes instantaneously:** Manual payroll modifications, such as\nadding new employee data to the system or adding or correcting employees' bank\naccount details, requires your employees to fill up multiple paper forms. With\nautomated payroll software, you can make modifications directly in the system.\nSome payroll platforms allow these changes to be made by the employer as well\nas the employees.\n\n **Maintain consistency across departments:** High-performing payroll software\nhelps you maintain consistency in different departments, thus, keeping\neveryone on the same page. Furthermore, having a centralised HR management\nsoftware keeps employees from different departments updated on your latest HR\npolicies without having to touch base with other offices individually.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges of automating payroll processes is the absence\nof in-house payroll skills, compelling organizations to count on payroll\noutsourcing tailored to fit their business. Therefore, before taking the final\nplunge, you need to prepare by upgrading your skills and capabilities for this\nlarge-scale transformation.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8f54321/2147483647/strip/true/crop/200x200+0+29/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2Fe9%2F27%2F774fa2134473966449f93e78950a%2Funnamed.png)\n](https://www.benefitnews.com/author/kiran-bajpai)\n\n[Kiran

Even if the payroll function is in finance, HR must\nunderstand the latest trends in payroll management from both the worker\nperspective and the technology perspective. Both affect employee experience,\nas well as companies' ability to run smoothly and efficiently, as starkly\nillustrated by the [collapse of\nMyPayrollHR](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252470457/MyPayrollHR-\ncollapse-stirs-allegations-questions-anger).\n\nHere are five of the latest trends in payroll management HR leaders and their\nteams should understand.\n\n### __1\\. Stronger compliance and security\n\nManaging HR data is rife with potential disasters, and compliance and security\nare only becoming more difficult.\n\nYou need a payroll provider you can trust. For example, it must have the\nexpertise to ensure accuracy in the changing world of taxation regulations. It\nmust also have a vault-tight security system to keep hackers from rerouting\npayouts to their own pockets.\n\nThis means choosing [the right payroll\nprovider](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/How-to-choose-a-payroll-\nvendor-8-keys-for-SMBs) is a must.\n\n### __2\\. Increased payroll complexity\n\nA list of the latest trends in payroll management would not be complete\nwithout discussing the so-called gig economy. How and when employees are paid\nis shifting as the composition of the workforce changes to one with more\n[short-term and project-based\nworkers](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Bias-and-diversity-\nin-the-gig-economy-What-HR-should-know). This setup requires more flexibility\nthan many traditional payroll systems can provide, which, in turn, means more\ncomplexity on the back end. Payroll managers must promptly and accurately\naddress payment and taxation rules for contractors.\n\nWhat actually constitutes an independent contractor versus an employee differs\nby location, according to legislation, and employers must accommodate whatever\nthat decision is. This is a very complex legal that companies and their HR\nteams -- among other departments -- should take seriously and must follow\nclosely.\n\nMisclassifying contractors cost Microsoft $97 million to settle a class-action\nlawsuit, for example. And a [recent California\nlaw](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-09-27/ab5-independent-\ncontractors-how-businesses-are-responding) has disrupted companies such as\nUber and Lyft with reclassifications of worker types.\n\n#### Ten criteria for choosing a payroll system\n\n  1. Mobile- in product development;\n  2. Demonstrated ability to support the locales in which you will do business;\n  3. Native support for alternative work arrangements, such as gig workers and contractors;\n  4. Easy-to-use employee and managerial self-service;\n  5. Support for unbanked employees;\n  6. Pay cards or virtual cards;\n  7. Off-cycle payouts for managers to give immediate spot bonuses or employees who seek daily pay for work accomplished;\n  8. Chatbot self-help for users;\n  9. Preexisting integration or integration tools; and\n  10. Demonstrated system security.\n\n### __3\\. Personalized payment options\n\n> Traditional payment methods don't serve teen workers and other hourly\n> employees and employees who don't have bank accounts.  __\n\nAs in the customer arena, choice is paramount to the employee experience --\nand that goes for how workers are paid.\n\nOne demonstration of this is in the need for faster, easier payment.\nTraditional payment methods don't serve teen workers and other hourly\nemployees and employees who don't have bank accounts. For example, people who\ntypically work multiple jobs to make ends meet may be better served by a more\nfrequent paycheck, rather than receiving one every two weeks. [Direct payment\nto a pay card](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252441135/ADP-\npayments-card-system-aimed-at-millennials) is one way employers are giving\nemployees quicker, easier access to their paychecks.\n\n### __4\\. Improved user experience for HR tech\n\nMore human capital management (HCM) systems today are available in the cloud,\nand [payroll is no exception](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Better-\npayroll-automation-is-next-frontier-for-HR-software). This means more next-gen\nHR tech is becoming available. For example, HR teams can look for software\nproviders that develop mobile-native apps. HR teams can also [look for AI or\nchatbot technology](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/4-future-\nworkplace-trends-HR-should-understand-for-2020-and-beyond) that can help users\nanswer questions on the fly, make suggestions on savings and spending patterns\nor help managers identify compliance rules for bonuses.\n\nWith all that said, the payroll administrator requires a more sophisticated\ninterface that reflects the more complicated areas of payroll to which they\nneed access, such as the total bonus pool allotted. This can make for some\ntricky HR tech decisions.\n\n#### The employee of the future: A scenario\n\nSay an employee called Chris clocks in and out of work with a virtual card, a\nsecure cellphone app to which earnings of the day are downloaded at clock-out.\nAs an unbanked worker with multiple jobs, Chris' employers have systems\nthrough which money designated for rent and utilities is automatically\ndeducted and paid out to those creditors monthly, with healthcare and saving\noptions available.\n\nUse of the app in a grocery store is much like the airport boarding pass of\nyesteryear and automatically deducts the purchase from the amount on the\nvirtual card. Because of widely adopted industry standards in virtual pay\ncards, one application can synthesize the pay, taxes and time on the job. It\ncan also show Chris when money comes in and goes out from the multiple\nemployers on the same app in real time.\n\n### __5\\. Required integration with other applications\n\nPayroll services also require integration with finance and HCM applications,\nin order to offer total rewards, performance management and bonus or quota\nmanagement and payouts. [Multiapplication\nintegration](https://www.scnsoft.com/blog/enterprise-application-integration-\nguide) is complex and difficult to do well, so you should look for suites that\nare designed for integration, as well as products that come with connectors to\nother applications used within your organization. No matter how new and\ninnovative the software may be, it must communicate with the rest of the\nenterprise.\n\nThe world of work is changing, and the way companies compensate workers has to\nchange with it. Companies and their HR teams must not only understand the\nlatest trends in payroll management, but also how best to apply them to their\nown changing workforces.\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on Core HR, payroll and benefits administration\n\n  * [\n\n##### 4 ways to implement HR support for remote employees\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/meltzer_rachel.jpg) By: Rachel\nMeltzer ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/4-ways-to-implement-HR-\nsupport-for-remote-employees)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Top 2020 HR trends: Employee and candidate experience, AI and more\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/daniel_diann.jpg) By: Diann\nDaniel ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Top-7-HR-trends-\nfor-2020-and-beyond-The-change-decade)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Better payroll automation is next frontier for HR software\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/Cath-Everett-CW.jpg) By: Cath\nEverett ](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Better-payroll-automation-is-\nnext-frontier-for-HR-software)\n\n  * [\n\n##### How D+1 keeps payroll woes at bay\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/Aaron-Tan-CW.jpg) By: Aaron\nTan ](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252459866/How-D1-keeps-payroll-woes-\nat-bay)\n\n  * [![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/jones_katherine_02.jpg)](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Katherine-Jones)\n\n[Katherine Jones](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Katherine-Jones)\nasks:\n\n## What is your opinion on the latest trends in payroll management?\n\n__\n\nJoin the Discussion\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [How IT and HR can Partner to Deliver a Better Employee Experience](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/How-IT-and-HR-can-Partner-to-Deliver-a-Better-Employee-Experience) -Citrix\n  * [Want Engaged and Inspired Employees?

Ee\nGwee](//cmg.scdn4.secure.raxcdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/small/Shin\nEe Gwee.jpg)\n\n# Benefits of using a managed services provider for payroll in Singapore\n\nBY SHIN EE GWEE\n\nSingaporean companies should focus on the strategic aspects of HR and leave\nthe day-to-day functions to professional managed services providers, who can\ndrive efficiency, reduce costs and improve security.\n\nAll businesses strive to achieve operational efficiency and keep costs tightly\nunder control. This can be particularly difficult in Singapore, where\nrecruitment - and retention - is seen as a major challenge for businesses\noperating amidst evolving regulation. HR professionals are key to attracting\nand retaining talent and establishing policies for employee's growth and\ndevelopment, but they get stuck doing payroll, office management and reactive\ntasks, which massively restricts the more strategic elements of the role. It\nis time to consider moving your payroll operations to trusted HR service\nproviders to undertake the regular, but vital, basic HR functions. Here are\nthree ways in which this approach benefits your business.\n\n**It helps you to focus on strategic HR activities**  \nThe role of HR is changing. It is no longer just an administrative function\nwith a focus on payroll, statutory compliance and maintaining personnel\nrecords, but rather has evolved to supporting long-term business growth within\norganisations.\n\nWhilst payroll doesn't contribute to revenue, it is, of course, a crucial\nfunction. If payroll is carried out poorly, it will adversely impact an\norganisation. Handling payroll effectively requires significant time and a\ndeep knowledge of wide-ranging statutory requirements - and this is the core\nskillset of a professional managed services provider.\n\nSuch providers can reduce the risk of HR resource crunch due to employee\nturnover and failing to comply with local regulations, allowing you to focus\non truly transformative HR projects. They can give you the time to build your\nbrand and build an employee value proposition.\n\n**It harnesses the full power of technology**  \nAdvances in technology are helping businesses to scale and provide a better\nemployee experience. A single portal to access HR and payroll data will be\nmore convenient for the company and their employees as everything is under one\nplatform.\n\nAs businesses grow, they require access to more data for analysis and have\nincreased reporting demands. HR professionals can plan the activities in\nadvance when they have complete visibility of payroll processes and\noperations. Employees also want technology that can offer self-service access\nto their payroll information such as payslips, leave applications, expense\nclaims and timesheet data. Payroll processes will certainly be more efficient\nwhen the data collection is changed from manual to electronic.  \nWorking with a specialist external provider and their online tools allows you\nto improve efficiency and enhance the employee experience.\n\n**It reduces costs whilst increasing security**  \nPayroll providers offer a cost-effective and secure option by being a one-stop\nshop for payroll processes and technology. The alternative is for\norganisations to engage with and manage multiple providers, separately\noffering payroll services or payroll software, and paying for the software\nlicence cost and maintenance cost, which increases the total cost of\nprocessing significantly. You will receive the latest technology from a\nprofessional payroll services provider, and their experts will also provide\nlocal compliance and data security to minimise risk.\n\nIt is critical to select a managed services provider with relevant security\ncertification and standards to protect sensitive payroll data and personal\ninformation. International standards such as International Standard on\nAssurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402, ISO 27001 should form part of your\nassessment criteria when you select a payroll servicer provider.\n\n**Next steps**  \nThere are significant benefits, both financially and operationally, when\nmoving your HR administration and payroll to a professional managed services\nprovider that has a large, local team of administrative and specialist staff.\n\nYour own HR team can then be more involved with driving strategy for the core\nbusiness to help deliver future growth. A specialist provider has the\nexpertise and focused functions to manage regulatory change and to provide a\nconsistent and efficient service encompassing the latest technology. The\nincorporation of automated services improves the employee experience and\nsafeguards your employees' information.\n\n**_The views expressed in this column are the author 's own and do not\nnecessarily reflect this publication's view, and this article is not edited by\nSingapore Business Review.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and\nEconomic Security Act, known as the Cares Act, addresses the impact of\nCovid-19 on the U.S. economy. The House of Representatives must still vote on\nthe legislation, H.R. 748, which is expected to pass Friday.\n\n\u201cThis bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the\nneeds of the American people,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi [said in a\nstatement.](https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/pelosi-statement-on-\nsenate-coronavirus-bill-agreement?mod=article_inline) \u201cWhile the compromise\ndoes not go as far as our Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act,\nthanks to the unity and insistence of Senate and House Democrats, the bill has\nmoved a great deal closer to America\u2019s workers.\u201d\n\nThe legislation calls for Americans making up to $75,000 to receive direct\npayments up to $1,200. The aid package includes $350 billion in small-\nbusiness loans, $250 billion in unemployment insurance benefits and $500\nbillion in loans for distressed companies. The share of loans spent on rent,\nmortgage interest, and utilities would be eligible for forgiveness by the\nSmall Business Administration if companies meet certain conditions.\n\nThere are 30.7 million small businesses in the U.S., which employ 59.9 million\nAmericans, the SBA\u2019s office of advocacy said. This means 47.3% of all\nemployees in the U.S. work for a small business.\n\nPassage of the Cares Act comes as initial U. S. claims for unemployment\nbenefits [surged to 3.28\nmillion](https://www.barrons.com/articles/3-28-million-americans-file-for-\nunemployment-benefits-thats-10-times-as-many-as-last-\nweek-51585228627?mod=article_inline) for the week ended Saturday, the Labor\nDepartment said Thursday. The previous record high, of 695,000, was set in\nOctober 1982.\n\nFor small business, one of the more important sections of H.R. 748 is the\nPaycheck Protection Program. [This\nprogram](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/28e8263e-e7d4-4da7-a67b-077c54ba4220/9F7B494B2E355791B24536DC2162CF16.final-\none-pager-keeping-american-workers-paid-and-employed-\nact-.pdf?mod=article_inline) gives the SBA the ability to guarantee $350\nbillion in loans to small businesses via a network of more than 800 banks. The\nPaycheck program provides eight weeks of cash-flow assistance to small\nbusinesses with 500 employees or fewer.\n\nThe low-interest loans are meant to cover payroll costs, paid sick leave,\nsupply-chain disruptions, employee salaries, health-insurance premiums, and\nmortgage payments. The maximum loan amount is $10 million while the interest\nrate on the loans can\u2019t surpass 4%.\n\nIf the employers maintain their payrolls until June, the portion of the loans\nused ****for payroll costs, interest on mortgage obligations, rent, and\nutilities would be forgiven.\n\nSelf-employed individuals, or those part of the \u201cgig economy,\u201d can access\nPaycheck loans, as can certain nonprofits, including 501(c)(3) organizations\nand 501(c)(19) veteran organizations.\n\nThe Cares Act, however, does not provide relief for portfolio companies owned\nby private-equity or venture-capital firms.\n\n\u201cThe unprecedented crisis facing our nation\u2019s small businesses and their\nemployees requires an immediate, bold response,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL),\nwho crafted the Paycheck Protection Program, in a statement.\n\nThe SBA would administer the program once its passed and signed into law. A\nspokesman for the SBA declined to comment because H.R. 748 is a legislative\nproposal.\n\n**Write to** Luisa Beltran at\n[luisa.beltran@dowjones.com](mailto:luisa.beltran@dowjones.com)\n\n* * *\n\nClose\n\n### What the Cares Act Will Bring to Small Businesses\n\nThe $2 trillion stimulus package passed late Wednesday promises to deliver\nsome help to small businesses devastated by Covid-19.\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nMessage\n\nSEND\n\nAn error has occurred, please try again later.\n\nThank you\n\nThis article has been sent to\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/barrons?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[](https://twitter.com/barronsonline/?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[](http://www.linkedin.com/company/41970?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[](https://www.instagram.com/Barrons/?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[Privacy Notice](https://dowjones.com/privacy-notice/?mod=BOL)\n\n[Cookie Notice](https://dowjones.com/cookie-notice/?mod=BOL)\n\n[Copyright Policy](https://www.barrons.com/about/copyright-\npolicy?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[Data Policy](https://www.barrons.com/about/data-policy?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[Your Ad Choices](https://dowjones.com/cookie-notice/?mod=hp_FOOTER#cookies-\nadvertising)\n\n[Subscriber Agreement & Terms of\nUse](https://www.barrons.com/about/subscriber-agreement?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\nCopyright \u00a92020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

This measure, which is a part of the COVID-19 Economic\nResponse Plan, would support businesses that are hardest hit by the pandemic.\n\n\"We are helping businesses keep their staff on payroll so that businesses will\nbe better positioned to rebound when the current challenges have passed,\" says\nBill Morneau, minister of finance. \"We will continue to do whatever it takes\nto ensure that workers and businesses are supported through the outbreak, and\nthat our economy remains resilient during these difficult times.\"\n\nThe Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy would apply at a rate of 75 per cent of the\nfirst $58,700 normally earned by employees, representing a benefit of up to\n$847 per week from March 15 to June 6, 2020. It will be available for three\nmonths, retroactive to March 15.\n\nThe funding is available for all private employers whose gross revenues\ndropped by at least 30 per cent in March, April or May this year compared to\nthe same months in 2019. Eligibility will be based entirely on the salary or\nwages actually paid to employees. All employers would be expected to at least\nmake best efforts to top up salaries to 100 per cent of the maximum wages\ncovered.\n\nOrganizations that do not qualify for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy,\nmeanwhile, may continue to qualify for the previously announced wage subsidy\nof 10 per cent of remuneration paid from March 18 to June 20, up to a maximum\nof $1,375 per employee and $25,000 per employer.\n\n**Emergency response benefit**  \nThe government has also launched the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB),\nwhich will provide Canadian workers who have lost their income because of\nCOVID-19 $2,000 per month for up to four months.\n\nThose covered by the benefit are:\n\n  * workers who must stop working due to COVID-19 and do not have access to paid leave or other income support\n  * workers who lost their employment, as well as workers who are sick, quarantined or taking care of someone who is sick with COVID-19\n  * working parents who must stay home without pay to care for children that are sick or need additional care because of school and daycare closures\n  * workers who still have their employment but are not being paid because there is currently not sufficient work and their employer has asked them not to come to work.\n\nThe application period will start on April 6. Direct deposit payments will be\ndelivered into accounts within three business days of applicants being\neligible to receive it, and cheques within 10 days, says the government.\n\n\"No one should have to worry about paying their rent or mortgage, or\nsupporting their families,\" says Carla Qualtrogu, minister of employment,\nworkforce development and disability inclusion. \"The design of the CERB is\nbeing kept as simple as possible to make it quick and easy to access for all\nCanadian workers.\"\n\n[Nearly half (44 per cent) of Canadians say that they or someone in their\nhousehold have lost hours due to the economic\ndownturn](https://www.hrreporter.com/focus-areas/compensation-and-\nbenefits/nearly-half-of-canadian-households-have-lost-work-due-to-\ncovid-19-survey/327971), according to a study from the Angus Reid Institute.\n\nMeanwhile, [18 per cent of employers have eliminated or reduced seasonal\nworkers and 16 per cent have reduced the use of contract workers or other non-\nemployee populations](https://www.hrreporter.com/focus-areas/compensation-and-\nbenefits/almost-one-fifth-of-employers-planning-or-making-workforce-\nreductions-amid-pandemic/328181), according to Willis Towers Watson.\n\n### Latest stories\n\n  * [Quebec offers incentives to low-income, essential services workers](/focus-areas/compensation-and-benefits/quebec-offers-incentives-to-low-income-essential-services-workers/328429)\n  * [1 in 5 employers rewarding front-line workers amid pandemic: survey](/focus-areas/compensation-and-benefits/1-in-5-employers-rewarding-front-line-workers-amid-pandemic-survey/328347)\n  * [Half of small employers in U.S. can't afford payroll for month of lockdown](/focus-areas/compensation-and-benefits/half-of-small-employers-in-u.s.-cant-afford-payroll-for-month-of-lockdown/328343)\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nThe Canadian HR Newswire is a FREE weekly newsletter that keeps you up to date\non news, opinion and analysis about the field of human resources.

The addition of these two strategic\nacquisitions further enhances our presence in the HR and Payroll solutions\nmarket particularly in the small to medium market. With the UK experiencing a\ntightening of resource availability, we believe that organisations will now\nmore than ever require the capability to easily attract, retain, engage and\nre-train employees, as opportunities for growth and expansion present\nthemselves.

As long\nas nobody is shouting about it, the prevailing belief in many management teams\nis that you can leave well alone. This is a big mistake.\n\nWhereas payroll and HR administration is often described as \u2018back-office\u2019, it\nshould more accurately be labelled as \u2018business-critical\u2019.\n\nWithout the ability to pay its people accurately and on-time, a business can\u2019t\noperate to its maximum potential. This is because:\n\n1\\. Payroll is a central transaction in the employer-employee relationship \u2013\nfundamental to employee relations and the formation of company culture.\n\n2\\. Payroll is the single biggest operational cost for many businesses.\n\n3\\. Payroll is complex, as it\u2019s typically the repository of the company\u2019s\naccumulated complexity arising from change like M&A and evolutions of policy.\n\n4\\. Payroll is an increasingly regulated area, with obligations as diverse as\nNational Minimum Wage, FCA rules around incentivisation, CEO pay ratio\nreporting, and the GDPR.\n\nWith this in mind, it\u2019s clear that it can\u2019t be the sole concern of the payroll\nand HR admin team. A business with an underperforming payroll and HR system\nwill feel the impact on its people, its finances, and its reputation.\n\nBy contrast, a business that ascribes strategic importance to how it handles\nemployee data and pays its people will reap rich rewards. Here\u2019s why.\n\n**The foundation of employee experience**\n\nIt\u2019s would be hard to believe there is a company anywhere that can claim 100%\naccuracy on its payroll and (HR) records. There are many factors that explain\nthis, but one of the main one is that employees are increasingly responsible\nin modern companies for the inputs that drive pay, as HR functions move\ntowards self-service.\n\nHowever, our recent research suggests a problem is affecting many companies\nthat is much more serious in scale and impact than one might expect.\n\nAccording to our recent research, 39% of UK employees have been paid late on\nat least one occasion, while 60% have noticed mistakes on their payslips.\n\nRoughly half (48%) said that this made them feel their employer didn\u2019t care\nabout their wellbeing, a similar number (40%) claimed it put their financial\nsituation at risk, and a quarter (25%) admitted it made them less engaged and\nproductive at work.\n\nBut perhaps most significantly, one in five (21%) said they have actually\nchanged jobs because of a payroll incident.\n\nWe were surprised by these findings, since the employers we work with on\npayroll have a high standard of efficiency and accuracy. Yet the evidence\nsuggests our customers\u2019 experience may be untypical.\n\nToo many organisations maintain the attitude that \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t\nfix it\u201d, believing that they can get by with legacy systems and prioritise\nother \u201csexier\u201d areas for HR investment. We believe companies that are serious\nabout their people strategy should fix this fundamental issue before anything\nelse.\n\nCompanies send a powerful cultural signal to their employees when user-\ninterfaces are modern, easy to use and faff-free. Modern payroll and HR\nsoftware fit a culture which focuses on customer experience and\nresponsiveness.\n\nIf a company subjects its employees to a rigmarole of frequent errors,\nmultiple sign-offs, paper forms in excess and mind-numbing administrative\nprocesses, it\u2019s hardly surprising if those employees then treat customers in\nthe same way.\n\nEven the way data is collected in payroll and HR systems can send powerful\nsignals about culture and values. For example, allowing employees to self-\ndescribe their gender within the system helps to promote an inclusive\nworkplace culture.\n\nIn a sense, this is an example of corporate existence catching up with how the\nworld has changed for millennial and Generation Z consumers \u2013 Facebook already\nallows over 70 gender categories for users to identify with.\n\n**The power of data**\n\nAt a time when technology is transforming a plethora of business processes,\npayroll and HR administration is no exception. Advances in automation have\nenabled greater speed and accuracy, and modern user interfaces can make the\nexperience painless for regular employees and HR professionals alike.\n\nBut one potential benefit of modern payroll technology that\u2019s often under-\nappreciated is the increased power of data to create business insights.\n\nThe payroll, and the HR records that drive it, is the definitive source for\nall the fundamental knowledge that the business has about its employees \u2013 who\njoined, who left, who got promoted, who worked what hours, and much more.\n\nBasic analysis can help identify outliers which might indicate an historic\naberration in rates or worked hours in the past, driving additional cost. More\nsophisticated correlations can be made, to create predictive analysis of HR\ndata \u2013 for instance, to suggest who might be at risk of leaving an\norganisation.\n\nThe best organisations are able to correlate HR variables from the payroll\nwith other business metrics, unlocking real P&L value and making the HR voice\nmuch more authoritative in the boardroom.\n\nWe are seeing increasing numbers of companies begin to recognise the boardroom\nvalue of modernising backroom processes. One hopes for the competitiveness of\nBritish business that, in a challenging economic environment, more soon follow\nsuit.\n\n_John Petter is CEO of[Zellis](https://www.zellis.com/)._\n\n[\n\nPrev

management, integrity improves, along with\nstandardization, transparency and ultimately, process design.\n\nBy: [Paul Bartlett](https://hrexecutive.com/author/paul-bartlett/ \"Posts by\nPaul Bartlett\") | February 10, 2020 \u2022 3 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Leadership](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrleadership/) | [HR\nTechnology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hpb/hpb-top-stories/) |

looking for continuous process improvements\nand new ways to enhance organizational effectiveness. It\u2019s an evergreen topic\nand one that deserves ongoing consideration and attention. Markets fluctuate,\ncompetitive pressures necessitate constant change and business goals evolve.\nPerhaps nowhere is this more apparent than within human resources, a critical\ncorporate function constantly challenged with demonstrating its value and\nmeasuring what matters. Factor in global presence and the imperative grows\neven taller, as HR teams seek to orchestrate their activities across time\nzones, language barriers and local labor laws. All the while, payroll tackles\nsimilar challenges, working diligently to satisfy country-specific\nrequirements and ensure employees get paid accurately and on-time. Two\nseemingly separate needs, both handling workforce information day in and day\nout, maintaining and updating records, managing requests, and ultimately,\npromoting a positive employee experience across the board.\n\nDepending on the project, HR and payroll spend an excessive number of hours\ncoordinating data collection and verification, making adjustments,\ncalculations and transferring information as needed. Even organizations in the\nU.S. with enterprise solutions in place, struggle to automate across global\nlocations, relying instead on manual updates and spreadsheets and resulting in\nmore mistakes and higher costs back to the employer. Historically, it seemed\nimpossible to share workflows, and as a result, the HR and payroll landscape\nbecame increasingly fractured and decentralized, unable to bridge the divide \u2013\nuntil recently.\n\n**Revisiting product**\n\nToday, advanced technologies allow for the movement of data around the globe\nthrough automation across the cloud. With the shift towards digital\ntransformation, comes the opportunity to simplify and streamline systems\nthrough integration \u2013 but change happens slowly, as evidenced by last year\u2019s\n[Payroll Operations Survey from\nDeloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/human-\ncapital/articles/payroll-operations-survey.html), which showed only 6% of\ncompanies use robotics as part of their processing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nThere remains an amazing amount of information available that no one ever\nthought to get from the other, and a unified, automated approach between HR\nand payroll makes it possible to review and refresh what already exists while\ngathering anything missing. At the same time, recent regulations, such as\nGDPR, put new guidelines and restrictions in place, reinforcing the need for a\nfresh look. From a data security perspective, integrations enable teams to\nmonitor the access to and movement of data from a single source, as opposed to\nmany. In the case of one multinational financial services company, integration\nand automated workflows reduced reliance on manual interventions, improved\nreporting, and maintained compliance that meets regional standards while\nproviding significant process improvements.\n\nWith a global, unified platform, people and processes work collectively,\nmanaging both the day-to-day and unexpected tasks in real-time. Shared\nworkflows open up collaboration and communication, regardless of location,\nremoving the guesswork for scheduling and using built-in functionality for\nreporting and validations. Once the current workload becomes integrated and\nautomated, incremental activities get built on top of that base, contributing\nto improved efficiency and outcomes.\n\n**Unifying people**\n\nThere is no doubt that technology serves as the core of any integration, in\nthis instance, with the tools and automation embedded on a global basis,\nrather than country by country. But there is another critical factor to\nconsider in achieving these workflows because beyond the immediate\nstakeholders is the impact of HR and payroll have on the employee experience.\nFreeing up the tedium associated with disparate systems, HR and payroll\nprofessionals offload the process-heavy tasks and focus more on meaningful\ninitiatives \u2013 reinvigorating their roles and responsibilities and bringing\ninspiration and innovation to the organization.\n\nFor the multinational mentioned above, integration worked to centralize\npayroll data across jurisdictions, adding authorization and validation online\nwhile eliminating the need for different providers, forms, and documentation.\nAs a result of simplification and automation, the teams introduced online\npayslips and offered employees the opportunity to use self-service tools to\nmaintain personal data.\n\nWithout the stress of each country\u2019s run deadlines and the looming threat of\nerrors, payroll can build out and introduce new options like payroll cash\nadvances to help employees in between paychecks. On the HR side, having access\nto [global payroll](https://www.cloudpay.net/) data boosts visibility across\nthe workforce and supports internal recruitment and talent mobility programs \u2013\nat a time when [PwC sees a 50% increase in international\nassignments](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/managing-tomorrows-people/future-of-\nwork/pdf/talent-mobility-2020.pdf) on the horizon. Through integration, the\ncapabilities of HR and payroll expand, linking the two with employer brand\nmanagement while workers benefit as well, signaling a win-win for the\norganization.\n\n**Harmonizing process**\n\nOf course, as executives know all too well, there is always new and more work\nto do. What serves the organization today may not tomorrow, and HR and payroll\nneed to remain agile. [Deloitte refers to this mindset as\n\u201charmonizing\u201d](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/mergers-\nacqisitions/us-ma-using-integration-to-catalyze-hr-transformation.pdf) rather\nthan the more frequently used \u201coptimizing,\u201d noting that \u201cA transformative\nintegration \u2026 may identify opportunities to more efficiently deliver HR\nservices, including technology-enabled improvements and process redesign.\u201d\nHaving already touched upon improvements to service delivery, the focus shifts\nto process, which underpins the success of the product and the people involved\nwith HR and payroll.\n\nOften, through a series of workflows engines or mapping, metadata about the\nprocess gets captured, indicating where inefficiencies take place and offering\na clear line of sight into potential improvements. An instance of this\nhappening might involve first-time approval rates and the effectiveness of\nmoving HR data into the payroll process. By analyzing the success of the task,\nHR and payroll learn about the accuracy of existing data as well as anything\nmissing that would be required for future runs. No surprise that same\nmultinational now sees a payroll accuracy rate of 99.99% while bringing cost\nsavings across functions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nAs this practice progresses, with HR and payroll updating and automating as\nneeded, the organization gains more profound insights into the overall\nefficiency of its integrations and shared workflows. Through better data\nmanagement, integrity improves, along with standardization, transparency and\nultimately, process design, leading HR and payroll teams to harmonious,\nproductive co-habitation.\n\nThe HR and payroll markets continue to innovate and enhance all aspects of\nworkforce management, and with that, so must global employers. The rapid\nadvancement of automation, integration and workflows correspond directly with\nan organization\u2019s capacity to adapt and adopt quickly in the future. Like the\nemployee experience, digital transformation never stops, and the ability to\nintegrate HR and payroll offers global organizations the chance to evolve with\nworkforce needs in near real-time, positively impacting their product, process\nand people.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fshaping-\nhr-effectiveness-through-shared-workflows%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Shaping+HR+effectiveness+through+shared+workflows&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fshaping-\nhr-effectiveness-through-shared-workflows%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fshaping-\nhr-effectiveness-through-shared-workflows%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

ADP and Paychex currently dominate\nthe market, but new vendors are emerging and will continue to do so over the\nforeseeable future \u2013 offering new choices to businesses. New market entrants\nare generally localized, focusing on small and midsized local businesses. The\nnew wave of vendors aims to differentiate themselves based on personalized\nservices and intimate knowledge of the clients\u2019 business environment.\n\n## **Big Players Forced to Adapt**\n\nThe new market landscape threatens established players purchasing smaller\ncompetitors at a surprising rate.\n\nThis is great news for business owners. Increased competition is leading to\nmore comprehensive offerings for a full suite of human capital management\nservices. It is also pushing pricing down for key products. The newly\ncompetitive environment benefits customers who want to outsource some, but not\nall, of their payroll and HR needs. Vendors are now offering small and\nmidsized businesses package options to choose from, along with options to\npurchase functionalities in a piecemeal fashion.\n\n**Learn more:[How to Automate Payroll for SMBs: A Complete\nGuide](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-administration/how-to-\nautomate-payroll-for-smbs-a-complete-guide/)**\n\n## **New Technologies**\n\nAs the competition increases, payroll providers have no choice but to\nincorporate new technologies into their offering:\n\n  * **The Cloud:** Cloud computing offers clients flexibility and a more convenient way to access information and communicate with remote workers.\n  * **Mobile Access:** As cloud technology makes it easier to access payroll information remotely, many clients desire mobile app access to their data.\n  * **Automation:** Automation allows for faster processing and greater accuracy than is attainable through manual processes.\n  * **Artificial Intelligence:** While still in its infancy, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to perform advanced payroll tasks with minimal human input eventually. As this technology continues to mature, payroll providers are exploring ways to incorporate AI into offerings.\n\n## **What to Consider When Choosing a Payroll Provider**\n\nWith so many new products and a sea of customized offerings, it is becoming\nmore difficult for HR professionals to navigate the landscape and pick the\nsolution that\u2019s best for their organization. Below, we highlight five factors\nthat HR professionals must consider when selecting a payroll provider:\n\n  1. **Necessary Features:** Most crucially, clients must choose payroll solutions that possess their required functionalities. Typically, smaller clients with less developed needs only require straightforward solutions featuring basic functionality like payroll, tax filing, W-2s and 1099s, compliance services, and new hire reporting. Many local providers fulfill these basic needs. However, clients with bigger demands might be better off outsourcing their payroll to larger companies that are more likely to offer several solution packages with features tailored toward clients of different sizes.\n  2. **Price:** Of course, the price remains a crucial consideration when selecting a payroll vendor. Currently, most solutions require a single monthly base fee in addition to small, add-on costs for each employee. However, the pricing of various services also differs based on the provider and the included features **.** Clients must weigh their budget constraints against the above considerations when selecting a payroll provider.\n  3. **Ease of Use:** A payroll solution with excellent features is worthless if the client cannot leverage it effectively. The user interface is a critical consideration when selecting payroll providers. Clients should look for providers offering intuitive interfaces that are easy to learn.\n  4. **Customer Service:** If (or when) things go wrong, it must be easy for clients to reach their provider for assistance. After all, there is nothing more frustrating than waiting days for an answer to a simple question that should have taken minutes. For this reason, we recommend that clients test out the responsiveness of different providers\u2019 customer service lines before settling on a provider.\n  5. **Seamless Integration:** Finally, clients must ensure that their chosen payroll product integrates seamlessly with their existing solutions. Of course, this is necessary because a lack of such integration will result in delays, headaches, and additional costs to the client.  \n\nThe payroll services landscape is shifting in a way that favors the customer.\nNew offerings and solutions are finally making outsourcing a viable option for\npayroll services. But more than ever, businesses must be informed and up-to-\ndate regarding the market to ensure they get the best solution.\n\n**Learn more:[Transforming Payroll With RPA \u2013 Everything You Need

A [survey of 251 UK HR and payroll\nmanagers](https://www.businessleader.co.uk/uks-largest-employers-often-pay-\nstaff-incorrectly-or-late/66153/) in private-sector companies with more than\n1,000 staff, conducted by Censuswide on behalf of HR and payroll software and\nservices supplier MHR, reveals that 52% are still using spreadsheets as part\nof their payroll process, while just over one-third rely on paper-based\ntimesheets. The reason given for this by over half of respondents was that\n\u201cthings have always been done this way\u201d.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given the manual nature of at least some of their\nprocesses, 76% of organisations also admitted they have failed to pay\nemployees correctly or on time an average of four times over the past 12\nmonths.\n\nThe issue, says Pete Tiliakos, principal analyst for HR and technology\nservices at analyst firm NelsonHall, is that traditionally, companies have\ntreated payroll as a cost centre, which means many functions have \u201climped\nalong with cobbled-together solutions, disparate and outdated, albeit\nreliable, platforms and a lack of global reporting capability\u201d.\n\nBut as more and more businesses invest in [HR transformation\ninitiatives](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Getting-to-the-\npayoff-of-digital-transformation-in-HR), payroll is starting to be pulled\nalong too. \u201cOrganisations are realising that payroll is a big factor in HR\ntransformation,\u201d says Tiliakos. \u201cAlthough the focus has to date been on\nsourcing, developing and retaining talent, if you don\u2019t pay them on time and\naccurately, all that doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 so payroll is very important and has to\nbe included in the vision.\u201d\n\nThis is particularly true in the face of growing numbers of [gig workers in\nthe\neconomy](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252439029/Contingent-\nworkers-challenge-human-capital-management-strategies), who increasingly\nadvocate on-demand pay models that traditional payroll systems are not set up\nto deal with.\n\nOther drivers for change include compliance and the rising complexity of\nglobal regulations. The problem here is that enabling reliable, globally\nconsolidated payroll reporting is a big challenge when using decentralised,\npoorly integrated systems that are often different in each country, which\ntends to lead to the manual collation of reports.\n\n### __A market in transition\n\nAs a result, a common pattern for transformation initiatives is to start with\nHR and then move on to\n[payroll](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/payroll-software)\nabout 12 months after either initial discussions or the transition itself,\nalthough this is not always the case. For example, international expansion or\nmerger and acquisition activity sometimes forces the hand of employers to\ntackle payroll first.\n\nMelanie Robinson, senior HR director for sales and marketing at payroll\nservices giant ADP, says: \u201cPayroll is a market in transition, but the common\nthread is streamlining and simplifying manual processes. Whether we are\nlooking at single country or global payroll, it\u2019s about leveraging technology\nto cut costs, increase efficiency and improve the user experience.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean everything will be plain sailing. Common barriers to\nchange include an inability to make a positive business case that demonstrates\na sufficient return on investment, particularly if payroll is simply seen as a\ncost centre.\n\n#### Read more about HR software\n\n  * Allocating work by algorithm might have advantages for workers as well as employers.

Tiliakos says this is linked to the fact that \u201cmany organisations lack\nthe skills and capability to successfully manage change in-house for a large-\nscale transformation programme\u201d.\n\nA global lack of in-house payroll skills is also having an impact and, as a\nresult, is leading some organisations to go down the outsourcing route.\n\nNonetheless, Tiliakos believes the future looks bright for payroll. \u201cIt\u2019s an\ninteresting time in that technology, such as cloud and [robotic process\nautomation](https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/robotic-\nprocess-automation), is starting to make an impact and organisations are\nseeing it and wanting to modernise their solutions and leverage some of that,\u201d\nhe says.\n\nA key consideration here is that payroll data, which is among the richest,\nmost accurate but also most underused data in the business, has traditionally\nbeen difficult to get at and analyse. But as companies [update and integrate\ntheir systems](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/How-to-choose-a-\npayroll-vendor-8-keys-for-SMBs), it leads to \u201cmassive possibilities\u201d, says\nTiliakos.\n\n\u201cThe payroll professionals of the future will undertake a lot more analytics\nactivity and work with bots to ensure they are performing and interpreting\nwhat the trends are to create more optimisation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge\nopportunity for payroll to become more of a strategic partner for the\nbusiness, so in future it will be much less about manual processes and heavy-\nlifting and much more about value-add.\u201d\n\n#### Case study: The Castle Hotel, Taunton\n\nThe Castle Hotel has been able to boost the efficiency of its labour planning\nactivities by integrating rostering and electronic point of sale (epos)\nsoftware with its payroll system.\n\nLast year, the hotel, located in Taunton and employing about 100 people,\nreplaced a standalone electronic till with cloud-based epos applications from\nTalech.\n\nThe software was also integrated with Deputy\u2019s cloud-based staff rota and time\nclock packages, which replaced a previously manual system and enabled managers\nto optimise staff rotas based on current requirements.\n\nEmployees can use their smartphones to clock in and out and schedule time\naway, such as holidays.\n\nJon Peilow, the hotel\u2019s financial director, says: \u201cEffectively, in the past,\nnothing joined up and we had to calculate everything manually using\nspreadsheets. But the process has now become much more seamless and has saved\nus a lot of admin time.\u201d\n\nFor example, the time it takes to process payroll has been cut by half a day a\nmonth because it is no longer necessary to manually key in how many hours each\nemployee has worked. Using a CSV file, the information is now uploaded\ndirectly to the Castle\u2019s BrightPay cloud-based payroll system, which also\nreduces the likelihood of manual errors.\n\nThe new system, which replaced older Sage applications about six months ago,\nalso enables employees to access all their payroll data via a dedicated\nportal.\n\nMeanwhile, the hotel\u2019s six department heads are saving up to three hours a\nweek on putting together schedules and signing off timesheets. They also have\naccess to real-time reports on costs as a percentage of sales revenue and can\nsee how much is being spent on labour.\n\n\u201cUltimately, [staff are the biggest cost in hospitality\nbusinesses](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/450432644/Oxford-and-\nCambridge-Club-shelves-ledgers-for-time-and-attendance) and, while that\u2019s\ngoing up between 5% and 6% a year, it\u2019s difficult to increase charges\naccordingly, due to current market conditions,\u201d says Peilow. \u201cSo we need to\nget smarter about labour planning by becoming more efficient \u2013 and that means\nsharing data with department heads on a real-time basis.\u201d\n\nWhereas in the past, such information was shared monthly, the integrated\nsystem means it can now be viewed daily at the touch of a button, to optimise\nhow employees are deployed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a much more cost-effective approach and gives us what we need,\u201d says\nPeilow. \u201cAlthough we could undertake labour cost analysis before, it was very\nmanual and labour-intensive and so was always at the bottom of the pile. But\nnow we can treat it as a priority because that\u2019s where it is possible to make\nthe most efficiencies.\u201d\n\n#### Case study: Severn Trent Water\n\n[Severn Trent](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500246271/CIO-interview-\nMyron-Hrycyk-CIO-Severn-Trent-Water) Water\u2019s HR and payroll transformation\nproject is now starting to free up enough time to enable staff to analyse\npayroll data and use the insights gleaned to boost the wider employee\nexperience.\n\nThe utilities provider started its \u201ctransformational journey\u201d about a year\nago, which has resulted in it revisiting its policies, processes and\nprocedures \u201cto de-clutter them and remove the bureaucracy\u201d, says Joe Carter,\nthe firm\u2019s HR manager.\n\nA key objective was to ensure that such processes became more \u201cseamless and\nautomated\u201d to make it quicker and easier for the company\u2019s 6,500 staff and\nmanagers to undertake HR-related tasks, he says.\n\nA second goal was to reduce risk and improve the accuracy of payroll\nprocessing, and another was to free up Severn Trent\u2019s payroll team to perform\n\u201cmore meaningful activity that directly supports the business, and ensure\nthere is a human face rather than just a faceless HR function\u201d, says Carter.\n\nUltimately, though, the aim is to \u201cdeliver the best employee experience we\ncan\u201d, he says, and a big part of that is about ensuring people are paid\naccurately and on time each month.\n\n\u201cPayroll is something that people just expect to work and they don\u2019t\nnecessarily see what goes on behind the scenes, but they soon let you know if\nsomething goes wrong,\u201d says Carter. \u201cSo by increasing reliability, you can\nensure employees get a good experience and can focus on the job they\u2019re paid\nto do.\u201d\n\nTight integration between Severn Trent\u2019s long-term outsourcing supplier MHR\u2019s\ncloud-based iTrent payroll system and the utility firm\u2019s in-house SAP HR\napplications, plus the fact that the \u201cmajority of the payroll side of things\nis now automated\u201d, means that for the last six months or so, it has no longer\nbeen necessary for the three members of the in-house payroll team to key in\nany information manually, says Carter.\n\nInstead, they can now spend more of their time analysing payroll data in order\nto understand costs better, identify trends and potentially introduce business\nchange.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about freeing up time for the team to do more advanced analytics during\nthe payroll run, so they can see if things don\u2019t look right,\u201d says Carter .\n\u201cBut it\u2019s also about spotting business trends, so if there\u2019s a spike in\nsickness or overtime claims, we can engage with the business, query what is\ncausing the change and see if an intervention is necessary, such as providing\nmore resources.\n\n\u201cWhile it is still early days here, the aim over time is to focus more and\nmore on gaining strategic value from the careful analysis of payroll data.\nUsing data in this way isn\u2019t just about ensuring people are paid accurately\nand on time; it\u2019s about exploring what the data is telling us and how we can\nus it to improve productivity and the employee experience.\u201d\n\n####  __Read more on HR software\n\n  * [\n\n##### How real-time analytics can benefit HR\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/feffer_mark.jpg) By: Mark\nFeffer ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/How-real-time-analytics-\ncan-benefit-HR)\n\n  * [\n\n##### 5 of the latest trends in payroll management HR should know\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/jones_katherine_02.jpg) By:\nKatherine Jones ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/5-of-the-latest-\ntrends-in-payroll-management-HR-should-know)\n\n  * [\n\n##### HRIS (human resource information system)\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/rouse_margaret.jpg) By:\nMargaret Rouse ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/HRIS)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Employee engagement best practices still rely on the human touch\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/feffer_mark.jpg) By: Mark\nFeffer ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Employee-engagement-\nbest-practices-still-rely-on-the-human-touch)\n\n__Latest News\n\n  * [Judge refuses to delay Assange's extradition hearing over coronavirus pandemic](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481299/Judge-refuses-to-delay-Assanges-extradition-hearing-over-coronavirus-pandemic)\n  * [Coronavirus: Home business opportunity knocks for consumer IoT suppliers](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481286/Coronavirus-Home-business-opportunity-knocks-for-consumer-IoT-suppliers)\n  * [Happy developers write secure code, report claims](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481215/Happy-developers-write-secure-code-report-claims)\n  * [View All News](https://www.computerweekly.com/news)\n\n__Download CW Asia-Pacific\n\n  * [![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/APAC-0320-cover-252px.jpg)](https://www.computerweekly.com/ezine/CW-Asia-Pacific/CW-APAC-Expert-Advice-on-the-security-operations-centre) In The Current Issue:\n    * Inside the security operations centre: The nerve centre of security operations\n    * Defining and evaluating SOC as a service\n[ Download Current Issue](https://www.computerweekly.com/ezine/CW-Asia-\nPacific/CW-APAC-Expert-Advice-on-the-security-operations-centre)\n\n__Latest Blog Posts\n\n  * [Combatting Covid Fraud: both doorstep and on-line: clarifying the sources of guidance](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/When-IT-Meets-Politics/Combatting-Covid-Fraud-both-doorstep-and-on-line-clarifying-the-sources-of-guidance) - When IT Meets Politics\n  * [IT modernisation series \u2013 Riverbed: Don\u2019t leave ops in the dark](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/CW-Developer-Network/IT-modernisation-series-Riverbed-Dont-leave-ops-in-the-dark) - CW Developer Network\n  * [View All Blogs](https://www.computerweekly.com/blogs)\n\n__Related Content\n\n  * [How real-time analytics can benefit HR](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/How-real-time-analytics-can-benefit-HR) - SearchHRSoftware\n  * [Employee engagement best practices still rely on the ...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Employee-engagement-best-practices-still-rely-on-the-human-touch) - SearchHRSoftware\n  * [Key HRIS implementation strategies for small business](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/HRMS-implementation-strategies-for-small-business) - SearchHRSoftware\n\n####  __Start the conversation\n\n###  __ 0 comments\n\nSend me notifications when other members comment.
