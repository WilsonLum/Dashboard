These new-age HRTech tools are now helping enterprises hire, train,\nengage and retain employees better, with a strong focus on increasing\n\u201cemployee experience\u201d and \u201corganizational productivity\u201d.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834c096babe.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n**HR News:**[VCV Launches AI-Powered Platform to Simplify the Hiring\nProcess](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/recruitment-onboarding/vcv-\nlaunches-aipowered-platform-to-simplify-hiring-process/)\n\nSingapore has traditionally been seen as a laggard in HRTech adoption, but the\nscenario has been fast-changing over the last two years. This demand for HR\ntechnologies has been further accelerated in recent times due to the COVID-19\noutbreak, as Singapore enterprises are looking to digitalize their HR\nfunctions to support remote working.\n\nThe details of all these providers have been published in the recently\nreleased 2020 Singapore HRTech Market Map, a comprehensive and collaborative\nresearch product of Adrian Tan, renowned HRTech blogger, and [hr\ntech.sg](https://www.hrtech.sg/), a Singapore-based boutique HRTech advisory,\nand analyst firm. Incidentally, Both Adrian Tan and hr tech.sg had worked\ntogether on the [2019 Market Map](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/digital-\ntransformation/2019-singapore-hrtech-market-map-unveiled-a-\nrecord-160-specialised-local-and-overseas-hrtech-providers-servicing-the-\nsingapore-talent-marketplace/) also, which was widely acclaimed for his\ncomprehensive coverage of the categories and players.\n\nA step further, the 2020 Singapore HR Tech Market Map has seen the addition of\nnewer HR categories and subcategories to help HR Professionals and Enterprises\nchoose the vendors in line with their specific needs.\n\nThe 2020 market map has been categorized the service providers across EIGHT\nmajor Talent segments: Talent Acquisition (Applicant Tracking System;\nSourcing\u00beJob Boards, Referrals, Tech Hiring, Non-PMET; Screening\u00beAssessments,\nVideo Interviews, Background Check), Talent Engagement (Employee\nCommunication; Onboarding; Performance Management), Talent Development\n(Coaching & Mentoring; Competency Management), Talent Operations **** (HR\nAutomation & Bots; Payroll), Talent Rewards (Benefits, Wellness, Compensation\nManagement), Talent Analytics, Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS\nEnterprise and SMB\u2019s) and Talent Planning.\n\n\u201cThe need of the hour for HR functions is to aggressively adopt HRTech. This\nwill not only help the HR teams to solve pressing business challenges and use\nbudgets more efficiently, but it also improves candidate and employee\nexperience too. And notably, it frees up bandwidth for HR teams to focus on\nmore strategic initiatives\u201d, says Adrian Tan.\n\n\u201cEnterprises that focus on HRTech as part of their transformational agenda are\ncreating sustainable economic value and better workplace experience for their\nemployees. Singapore enterprises should now leverage the Resilience Budget\nprovisions unveiled in the Parliament recently by Singapore\u2019s Deputy Prime\nMinister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, and other government programs\nsuch as IMDA\u2019s Singapore Digital (SG:D) initiative to digitalize their HR\nfunction\u201d, adds Sriram Iyer, CEO, hr tech.sg.\n\nOrganizations around the world are widely adopting systems from enterprise\nsoftware providers as well as specialized HR tech vendors, depending on their\nspecific workplace requirements.\n\n**HR News:**[The Era of Passwords at Work Ends With the Release of Okta\nFastpass](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/hr-tech-news/the-era-of-\npasswords-at-work-ends-with-the-release-of-okta-fastpass/)\n\n![2020 Singapore HR Tech Market Map](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=HR+Technology+Service+Providers+Aim+at+Digital+Transformation\n\"Share this News on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=HR+Technology+Service+Providers+Aim+at+Digital+Transformation&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this News on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this News on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this News on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-email-\nicon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=HR Technology Service Providers Aim at Digital\nTransformation&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this News via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Digital Transformation ](/category/digital-\ntransformation/ \"Digital Transformation\")\n\n  * [ ![Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/shutterstock_1134410339_5db306fad1860.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-special-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-\nspecial-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe future of work is uncertain, and the fear of AI taking over work is real.\nBut there\u2019s more to it, as expressed by some HR leaders we spoke to.\n\nby [Puja Lalwani](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/puja-\nlalwani-1/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Oct 25, 2019\n\n  * [ ![How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process \\(and How It Won\u2019t\\)](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/ai_in_recruitment_5da994c5c9d8b.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-and-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-wont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process (and How It Won\u2019t)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-\nand-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-\nwont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nWe hear a lot about AI\u2019s effect on jobs, but what about its effect on\nrecruiters?

Changes are\nhappening to the \u201cwhite-collar\u201d exemptions that allow businesses to exempt\ncertain employees from overtime. These exemptions are for employees in jobs\nclassified as executive, administrative, professional, computer and outside\nsales. However, to qualify for an exemption, the employees must pass a variety\nof tests and meet the requirements described in the Department of Labor\u2019s\ndefinition of each job type.\n\nOne constant in each of the exemptions is compensation level. Currently, to\nqualify for the exemption, an employee must be compensated at a rate of no\nless than $455 per week \u2013 an annual salary of $23,660. The new rule increases\nthat level to $35,568.\n\n **The second major HR issue** businesses should watch out for in 2020 is the\nproliferation of paid sick and parental leave. This is when an employee\nreceives the same wages as if they worked. Currently, there is no federal sick\nleave law. However, 11 states and Washington, D.C. mandate paid sick leave.\nThis is often paid through an employee-funded payroll tax.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in one of these areas, adjust your policy accordingly,\u201d Seawright\nsays.\n\nThese state laws establish minimum requirements for paid sick leave, but an\nemployer may provide sick leave through its own existing sick leave or paid\ntime off plan. Businesses can establish different plans for different\ncategories of workers. Each plan must satisfy the requirements of the new law.\n\n **The third issue** to watch for in 2020 is salary history and criminal\ninquiry bans. More states and cities are legislating \u201cban-the-box\u201d rules. In\nOctober, 13 states and 14 cities have a private employer criminal inquiry ban\nin place.\n\nThe \u201cbox\u201d refers to the question on job applications that asks applicants\nwhether or not they have ever been convicted of a crime. Ban-the-box laws\nrequire employers to remove this question \u2013 as well as any other queries about\ncriminal history \u2013 from job applications.\n\nThese laws were designed to prevent discrimination against applicants with\ncriminal records. Typically, employers are restricted from inquiring about\ncriminal history until later in the hiring process. Some ban-the-box laws\nrestrict how employers can use information obtained in a background check or\nwhen the checks can be done, but still, background checks are a must.\n\n\u201cI urge you to do (background checks) if you don\u2019t,\u201d Seawright says.\n\n **The fourth HR issue** to watch in 2020 is the return of the Social Security\nno-match letter.\n\nThese letters are issued by the Social Security Administration indicating that\ninformation on a wage and tax statement (Form W-2) does not match SSA records.\nHorticulture businesses may remember these letters. They stopped in 2012, but\nthe administration restarted the program in March 2019 for digital filers. In\nOctober 2019, SSA began issuing no-match letters for employers that filed\npaper W-2s.\n\nWhile receipt of a no-match letter does not mean the employee is in the U.S.\nillegally and is unauthorized to work, Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(ICE) routinely asks employers as part of the an I-9 audit whether they have\nreceived no-match letters. Failure to correct a discrepancy could result in\nviolations or fines under immigration laws.\n\nThe mismatch could have nothing to do with the immigration status of the\nemployee in question, Seawright says. Often, these no-match letters are the\nresult of administrative or transcription errors.\n\n\u201cBut in essence,\u201d she says, \u201cit puts you on notice that a person could be here\nillegally.\u201d\n\nHowever, employers cannot use the letter alone as the basis for taking adverse\naction against an employee.\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/States_with_paid_sick_leave_map_fmt.png)\n\n **The fifth HR issue** to watch for in 2020 is minimum wage and market\npressure. There has been a high-profile push to raise the federal minimum wage\nto $15/hour. This has created an expectation and prospective employees don\u2019t\ncare if the \u201cindustry average\u201d is less than that. However, Seawright says that\nlocal market rates are what matter most. Employers who do not or cannot\nincrease their wages to keep pace with local market rates will struggle to\nattract and retain workers.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of pressure on small businesses to pay $15 an hour,\u201d she says.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll be considered a bad employer, not paying a living wage.\u201d\n\nCompensation rates do not exist in a vacuum. Companies feeling the pressure to\nincrease starting rates for entry-level jobs must consider current workers in\nthe same position or job family. Otherwise, they leave themselves open for\nmorale problems, lost trust, discrimination complaints and a perception that\ntheir pay is not \u201cfair.\u201d\n\nSeawright has several solutions for companies facing this pressure. First,\nobtain current local market compensation data from the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics or another reliable source. Next, adjust start rates for entry-\nlevel positions to align to market rates. Third, adjust rates of pay for\ncurrent workers in the same position or job family, taking their length of\nservice into account. She notes the importance of calling this a market\nadjustment and not a merit increase.\n\nShe suggests developing a formula to ensure employees with more longevity\nshould earn more than new hires in the same job family. For example, employees\nwith 1-2 years of experience could receive the market rate plus X%. Employees\nwith 3-4 years of experience could earn the market rate plus Y%.\n\n **The final HR issue** for companies in 2020 is the cannabis conundrum. The\ndecriminalization and legalization of marijuana \u2013 whether medicinal or\nrecreational \u2013 is changing the landscape for employers. Many states have\nstrengthened workplace protections for medical marijuana users, so employers\nare unclear on how far they can or should go.\n\nIf your business is located where marijuana can legally be used for medical or\nrecreational purposes, you could eliminate drug testing entirely or remove\ncannabis specifically from pre- or post-hire drug panels. That eliminates the\nrisk of a discrimination or retaliation complaint but increases other risks.\n\nSeawright recommends a balanced approach. Keep cannabis in all drug test\npanels. But in the event of a positive test, use the same procedure you would\nfor other medical conditions. Require the employee to provide a doctor\u2019s note\nconfirming that he or she can safely perform his or her job duties and\noutlining any limitations. If the business would have to make accommodations,\ndetermine whether they are reasonable or would impose a hardship. If there is\nreasonable suspicion of impairment, you may be able to terminate the employee\nor take other disciplinary action.\n\n\u201cTrain your managers to recognize signs of impairment,\u201d she says.\n\nMatt McClellan is managing editor of Nursery Management magazine, Lawn &\nLandscape\u2019s sister publication.\n\n# Q&A with the expert\n\n### Q & A with the Experts - QandAwiththeExpert\n\n[Subscribe](/subscribe/)\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\n  \n\n**To view Lawn & Landscape's Q&A; with the Expert, click the image below.**\n\n[![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/Ask_the_Experts_cover_fmt.png)](http://giecdn.blob.core.windows.net/fileuploads/document/2020/04/07/ask%20the%20experts_full_compressed.pdf)\n\n# A complementary combination\n\n### Features - Business Focus\n\nAfter hitting $1 million in revenue, Jason Vahle had to balance operating the\ncompany he owned with the addition of a franchise.\n\n[Subscribe](/subscribe/)\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\n  \n\n[ Brooke Bilyj ](/author/12352)\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/20190820_132313_fmt.png)Jason\nVahle purchased a lawn care franchise to allow Green Thumb to focus on\nlandscaping and lawn maintenance.\n\nPhotos courtesy of Green Thumb Lawn Care N\u2019 Landscape\n\nJason Vahle expected \u201cthe skies to part\u201d when his company reached $1 million\nin revenue. But when Green Thumb Lawn Care N\u2019 Landscape hit that milestone in\n2014, Vahle realized he\u2019d need some help to grow it any further. \u201cEveryone\ntalks about it like you hit one million bucks and things get easier after\nthat, but it felt like we made less money even though we did more business,\u201d\nVahle says. \u201cI realized that growth is not just about taking everything that\ncomes through the door. You need to find your niche.\u201d\n\nTo take his operation to the next level, Vahle decided to purchase a lawn care\nfranchise that would diversify his services while offering centralized\nsupport. That fall, he began the process of purchasing a Spring-Green Lawn\nCare franchise to handle lawn care services, allowing Green Thumb to focus on\nlandscaping and lawn maintenance.\n\n\u201cThis allowed me to have the best of both worlds,\u201d Vahle says.\n\nNow in its fifth year, Vahle\u2019s franchise in St. Charles, Mo., is projecting\n$700,000 in revenue, while Green Thumb is eyeing $1.3 million. A strategically\ncomplementary combination, each side of the business helps grow the other.\n\n#### Expanding services.\n\nVahle\u2019s career started in college, when TruGreen recruited him at a job fair\nin 1999. He changed his major and went to work for the largest lawn care\ncompany in the country, working his way up to operations manager of the St.\nLouis area within a few years.\n\nThen, with the goal of providing more personal service while leveraging the\nbest practices he learned at TruGreen, Vahle started his own company in 2005.\nGreen Thumb Lawn Care N\u2019 Landscape grew gradually as new hires brought\nadditional skills to the team.\n\n\u201cWe started out focusing on mowing and fertilizing, and as I hired more people\nand expanded my workforce, I essentially expanded my services,\u201d Vahle says.\n\u201cHiring good people who knew more than I did was a huge benefit that allowed\nme to grow.\u201d\n\nAlthough this inadvertent approach to growth got the company to the $1 million\nmark, Vahle knew it wasn\u2019t sustainable. To get to the next level of success,\nVahle went the franchise route.\n\n### The power of online reviews\n\nGreen Thumb Lawn Care N\u2019 Landscape has accumulated over 150 online reviews,\naveraging a solid 4-star rating. Owner Jason Vahle says these votes of\nconfidence from satisfied customers help accelerate the company\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cMore and more, people are researching your company to find out your online\nreputation,\u201d Vahle says. \u201cOnline reviews are hugely important, so on every\nestimate and every interaction we have with a customer via email or mailed\nstatement, we ask for a review.\u201d\n\nBut a generic request on a document isn\u2019t nearly as compelling as a personal\nrequest from the crew member who\u2019s serving the customer. That\u2019s why Vahle\ncharges his employees with generating their own feedback, offering a small\ncash bonus any time a positive review mentions someone by name.\n\n\u201cEvery guy knows that if they get a four- or five-star review online that\nmentions them by name, the next day I show up at the shop and hand them $50,\u201d\nVahle says. \u201cWhen a customer is telling them they\u2019re doing a great job,\nthere\u2019s no better time to ask, \u2018Would you mind going online and giving me a\nreview, please?\u2019\u201d\n\nOne employee earned $350 from this incentive just during the first half of the\nyear. Others might only get the bonus once a quarter. But Vahle says any time\nhe hands out the cash, it encourages more employees to muster up the courage\nto ask for reviews.\n\n\u201cShowing up in front of everybody to hand someone $50 for something that\n(didn\u2019t require much effort) usually generates a lot of interest,\u201d he says.\n\n#### Strategic growth.\n\nVahle discovered several ingredients that were missing from Green Thumb\u2019s\ngrowth formula \u2013 like business plans, budgets and balance sheets. Learning how\nto understand these business fundamentals helped him improve both sides of the\nbusiness.\n\nHe learned to slow down and look at data to make decisions, rather than just\ngoing with what I think is a good decision. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a \u2018fly by the\nseat of our pants\u2019 approach to a more concerted effort. As a result, we\u2019ve had\nmore structured growth,\u201d he says.\n\nVahle began leveraging data to make more strategic decisions. Since his crews\nuse software that routes them to jobsites and tracks the time and cost\nassociated with each project, he had plenty of data to evaluate. Every winter,\nhe audits this info to assess the company\u2019s performance and identify the\nhighest-profit projects and accounts.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t just look at the numbers. He also discusses trends with his\nteam to get a clearer picture of what\u2019s happening behind the data.\n\n\u201cI talk to my guys and ask them, \u2018Why is Mrs. Smith\u2019s property taking twice as\nlong as it did a year ago?\u2019 Maybe she had a new pool put in and they have to\npush-mow and edge around it now,\u201d Vahle says. \u201cI also sit down with my wife\n(Laura), who runs the office, and talk to her about it. If that customer is\ncalling in with concerns every week, then we take that into account. If\ncustomers take a long time to pay, that\u2019s just a headache we don\u2019t need to put\nup with. We\u2019re busy, and that offers us the luxury of being picky.\u201d\n\nUsing this data, combined with input from his field crews and office staff,\nVahle determines which projects actually move the company forward \u2013 and which\nones hold it back.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve slowly filtered out things that don\u2019t make us profitable and don\u2019t keep\nus consistent,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough mowing is great for recurring revenue,\nwe\u2019ve curtailed how much maintenance we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019ve explored more\nservices on the hardscape and landscape construction side. That\u2019s helped\nstrategically grow the company.\u201d\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/20180612_125103_fmt.png)\n\n#### Shared resources.\n\nWhen Vahle opened his franchise, he reassured customers that: \u201cIt\u2019s the same\nguys, just wearing different uniforms and driving different trucks. You\u2019re\nstill calling the same office, dealing with the same people.\u201d\n\nGreen Thumb continued to offer lawn and landscape maintenance as well as\nconstruction of outdoor living areas, patios and retaining walls, while his\nfranchise handles the chemical applications for fertilization, weed control,\ntree and shrub care and pest control.\n\nGreen Thumb has about 17 people in the field, and the franchise side of the\nbusiness has four lawn technicians and one sales manager. Laura manages the\nback-office for both companies, with a support staff of two full-time and two\npart-time employees. While each company employs its own crews, there is some\ncrossover, which benefits both sides.\n\nGreen Thumb doesn\u2019t start its season as early as his franchise; they start at\nthe beginning of April, so it gives Green Thumb crews time to help on the\nSpring-Green side. \u201cLawn care is only 40-42 weeks out of the year, so the\nSpring-Green guys cross over into Green Thumb, helping out with leaf clean-\nups, snow removal or retaining walls in the wintertime after our H-2B labor\nleaves,\u201d Vahle says.\n\nThe companies also share clients, regularly subbing out work to each other to\noffer customers a seamless full-service offering.\n\n\u201cA lot of customers on the Green Thumb side are full maintenance; they have\ntheir services built into a seasonal contract,\u201d Vahle explains. \u201cIn doing\nthat, Spring-Green actually subcontracts Green Thumb to do the additional work\nor vice versa, depending which side the customer originated from. That allows\nus to keep the invoicing streamlined and consistent.\u201d\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/20180926_111447_fmt.png)\n\nWith almost 100 franchise locations across the country, Spring-Green offers\nnational buying power and marketing muscle that Vahle couldn\u2019t generate on his\nown.\n\n\u201cSpring-Green isn\u2019t just finding me lawn care customers, because people who\nget their lawns treated also get other services done. Being able to cross-\nmarket those customers without paying additional money is a big benefit,\u201d\nVahle says. \u201cAnd we do it both ways; as Green Thumb acquires a mowing\ncustomer, (we recommend that they get) fertilization as well to give them the\nbest results possible.\u201d\n\nBy setting up each business to focus on its own niche, Vahle leverages both\nteams\u2019 strengths to grow client relationships.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re first starting out, you\u2019ll take whatever work you can get, but\nsometimes that\u2019s not the best work for you,\u201d Vahle says. \u201cAs I grow bigger, I\nkeep coming back to the advice that was given to me early on: Find a niche.\nThat allows you to really be strategic about picking your clients and finding\nprojects that work well for your company.\u201d\n\nThe author is a freelance writer based in Cleveland.\n\n# Advancements in erosion control\n\n### Features - Erosion\n\nBetter versatility and more power are a couple of improvements erosion control\nmanufacturers have invested in for their equipment.\n\n[Subscribe](/subscribe/)\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\n  \n\n[ Catherine Meany ](/author/11354)\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/IMG_2113_fmt.png)\n\nPhotos courtesy of Express Blower\n\nYears ago, the EPA mandated that any groundbreaking over an acre requires some\nsort of erosion control measure be put in place. That\u2019s when Express Blower in\nEugene, Ore., really came into the picture, says Express Blower Marketing\nManager Carla Severe.\n\n\u201cWe have been doing erosion control for over 20 years, and it\u2019s just keeping\nup with what the environmental regulations are,\u201d Severe says.\n\nKeeping up with those regulations sometimes leads to user-side improvements as\nwell. As the deadline to conform to Tier 4 final approached, engineers at FINN\nCorporation, Express Blower\u2019s sister company in Fairfield, Ohio, made a number\nof changes to the technologies in their machines including hydrostatics. Those\nchanges resulted in an immediate response from the control systems where\npreviously there had been a lag behind, says Matt Hoffman, vice president of\nmarketing and sales at FINN Corporation.\n\n\u201cTechnological leaps and changes are going on because of the industry\nrequirements. Contractors and manufacturers alike are demanding more advanced\nmachines,\u201d Hoffman says.\n\nWhile many changes in equipment are due to adapting to government regulations\nlike Tier 4, other equipment advancements are driven by the customer. In fact,\nFINN Corporation held small focus groups to find out what\u2019s important to the\npeople buying their machines, Hoffman says.\n\n\u201cWe took all of that feedback and put together our product plan so we could\ncheck all the boxes of everything everybody was asking for. We did use a lot\nof feedback specifically from contractors so we could capture the things that\nthey thought were needed in the market,\u201d he says.\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/fog_shot_fmt.png)Government\nregulations forced them, but changes to equipment are proving helpful for\ncontractors.\n\n#### Strange and Curious Places.\n\nOne of the areas of importance identified through those focus groups was a\nneed for longer spray distances. As cities are becoming more populated, people\nare getting creative about where they are building homes and roadways. More\nprojects are being built on hillsides and in other challenging areas that\nrequire further spray distances to put down erosion control measures. This,\ncoupled with an increase in forest fires, droughts and flooding, are forcing\npeople to be cognizant of erosion control principles, and that\u2019s making them\ndo some \u201cstrange and curious things,\u201d Hoffman says.\n\nAnother tricky location for erosion control measures are green roofs. Green\nroofs are gaining popularity because they filter all of the gray water that is\ntypically caught on a rooftop before it gets down into the streets and\nwaterways. The challenge is moving all of the necessary materials up there.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, you\u2019d have to take it up a freight elevator or walk it through\na building, which were long and arduous efforts,\u201d Hoffman says. \u201cWe have\ntechnologies in our bark blowers and some of our bigger machines to\neffectively move that material straight up hoses on the sides of the buildings\nup to those rooftops. That\u2019s a significant advantage that can reduce labor and\nbe more efficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have customers that have blown a green roof 30-plus stories high, where\nbefore you have to have cranes and wheelbarrows and shut down a street\npractically,\u201d Severe says. \u201cThis has opened up some eyes about how you can do\nit safer and faster.\u201d\n\n#### Versatility.\n\nAnother frequent customer request of manufacturers is the ability to process\ndifferent materials through the machines. There are dozens of products that\ncan be used together for effective erosion control, from geotextiles to straw\nblankets, and hydroseeding to silk fences. FINN equipment offers improved\npumping technologies to support those different materials, Hoffman says.\n\n\u201cWe have found through hundreds of thousands of gallons of testing that a\ncentrifugal pump is by far the most efficient and effective design with the\nwide variety of materials that are processed,\u201d he says. \u201cOn one of our\nmachines, we even have the ability for someone to choose between the two types\nof pump technologies, the other being vortex.\u201d\n\n> \u201cTechnological leaps and changes are going on because of the industry\n> requirements.\u201d Matt Hoffman, VP of marketing at FINN Corporation\n\n#### Labor Savings.\n\nAs the industry struggles with finding enough workers and keeping costs down,\nequipment manufacturers must focus on products that can make contractors more\nefficient to reduce their costs and reliance on labor, Hoffman says.\n\n\u201cThe speed and efficiency of how you mix and spray is important. We\u2019ve\nintroduced some technologies that have helped us reduce processing time in the\nmixing system of the large tank hydroseeder.\u201d\n\nThe system, called the Integrinder, has shredding and integrated within the\ntank, and a basket catches this material and shreds it before it gets into the\nslurry mixture. Old technologies would grind above the tank, which was at best\ninefficient and at worst dangerous. The Integrinder also features a water\ncurtain that the materials pass through within the tank. This mitigates\nairborne dust and protects workers, Hoffman says.\n\nEven if a contractor\u2019s fleet is stocked with the latest equipment, if they\naren\u2019t trained up properly, they won\u2019t get the best results. Hoffman\nencourages contractors to seek out reputable manufacturers who have\nestablished themselves as leaders and who are Certified Professionals in\nErosion & Sediment Control.\n\n\u201cSeek out people that can help you when you have questions. We see companies\nwho want to get into the industry quickly to see if they can turn a buck, but\nthey haven\u2019t really designed and vetted that product so that it\u2019s effective\nfor that application,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to work with companies that have an\nunderstanding of the environment and of what\u2019s required to be successful.\u201d\n\n# Awesome add-on\n\n### Features - 2020 Design/Build Report\n\nILT Vignocchi had to work through flooding and plant issues to make the\nlandscape thrive after a house addition.\n\n[Subscribe](/subscribe/)\n\nApril 7, 2020\n\n  \n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/WINNETKA_PROJECT__BEFORE_1_CMYK_fmt.png)\n\nPhotos courtesy of ILT Vignocchi\n\nA necessary house addition forced a rethink of a stunning 30-year-old\nlandscape. Many new elements were added along with the resolution of\nsubstantial water issues.\n\nThe project was designed and installed by ILT Vignocchi in Wauconda, Illinois\nand it took a year to complete. It won the Judges\u2019 Award during the Illinois\nLandscape Contractor Association\u2019s 2020 iLandscape show. The Judges\u2019 Award is\nthe best project among all entries as chosen by the judges.\n\nPart of the property is in the 100-year floodplain. Due to this, the property\nwould consistently hold or take on water. It would always take a while for the\nwater table level to recede back to normal levels after a heavy rain. This\nwater fluctuation and slow draining affected the plant material over time.\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/A_fmt.png)\n\n\u201cShrubs and perennials showed signs of stress and trying to find the correct\nbalance of water-loving plants and plants that preferred drier conditions\n(which could happen mid-summer) always become a challenge,\u201d says Aaron Zych,\nlandscape architect and vice president at ILT Vignocchi.\n\n\u201cThat is the reason we installed a large gravel \u2018cistern\u2019 under the lawn\npanel, to drain the water away from all the new plants while having a place to\nstore all the collected water. This, along with using raised planting beds,\nprovided a home for many of the perennials that was more conducive to long\nterm health. Everything has been flourishing since the revisions.\u201d\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/D_CMYK_fmt.png)\n\nNew elements added to the property include a pool (which reused the existing\nirregular bluestone on the old patio for the decking), a brick privacy wall,\nthe plantings, a formal lawn panel (with the underground storage capacity for\nstorm water), garden paths, water features, a pond, an elevated sitting garden\nand a dinning and cocktail patio which all seamlessly blend together to create\na stunning rear yard.\n\nDuring construction, the extremely prized roses of the client had to be\ntransplanted, cared for off-site for months, and then replanted.\n\n![](/fileuploads/publications/1/issues/103667/articles/images/B_CMYK_fmt.png)\n\n\u201cRoses do not transplant great, so we had to take extra care when removing\nthem,\u201d Zych says. \u201cWe took them all to our off-site greenhouses, and cared for\nthem during the construction process. When construction was finished the roses\nwere replanted in their new raised garden bed.\u201d Access to the property was\nanother issue.\n\n\u201cThere were many large mature trees we had to work around so we didn\u2019t lose\nthem,\u201d he says. \u201cThis meant that bringing in large machinery to help with this\nproject was not an option. Small machines or hand work had to be done to make\nthis project possible.\u201d\n\n## Lawn & Landscape Radio Network\n\n[![Talking Tech with a C.T.O.](/fileuploads/image/2020/02/07/LLRN\n736x414_nologo_justin.jpg?w=736&h=414&mode=crop&scale=both)](/mayberry-\ntechnology-robotic.aspx)\n\n### [Talking Tech with a C.T.O.](/mayberry-technology-robotic.aspx)\n\n## Videos\n\n[![Episode Two: Lawn & Pest Solutions](/fileuploads/image/2020/03/26/TAT 2020\nEpisode 2_0.jpg?w=736&h=414&mode=crop&scale=both)](/episode-two-lawn-and-pest-\nsolutions.aspx)\n\n### [Episode Two: Lawn & Pest Solutions](/episode-two-lawn-and-pest-\nsolutions.aspx)\n\n[![Lawn & Landscape](/FileUploads/image/logos/site-logos/ll.png)](/)\n\n##\n\n  * [ ____ ](https://www.facebook.com/lawnandlandscape)\n  * [ ____ ](https://twitter.com/lawnlandscape)\n  * [ ____ ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lawn-landscape-magazine)\n  * [ ____ ](https://instagram.com/lawnlandscape/)\n\n  * [Golf Course Industry](https://www.golfcourseindustry.com)\n  * [Greenhouse Management](https://www.greenhousemag.com)\n  * [Nursery Management](https://www.nurserymag.com/)\n  * [Garden Center](https://www.gardencentermag.com)\n  * [Snow Magazine](https://www.snowmagazineonline.com)\n  * [PCT Magazine](https://www.pctonline.com)\n  * [CBT Magazine](https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com)\n  * [Contact Us](/ContactUs.aspx)\n  * [Subscribe](/subscribe)\n  * [Home](/)\n  * [RSS](/rss)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/)\n  * [Terms of Use](/terms-of-use/)\n  * (C) 2020 GIE Media, Inc.

So what is the disconnect?\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | March 17, 2020\n\nTopics: [Digital Transformation](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/digital-\ntransformation/) | [Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/hrtechnology/) |\n[Leadership](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/leadership/)\n\n_Tom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/83424484_m.jpg)\n\nInjecting new or updated technology into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover US$5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a US$250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% said the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, said Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner.\n\nTinder said her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe said. In fairness, she noted, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn\u2019t matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder said. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don\u2019t have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d\n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, said that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she said, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille said.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explained.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explained. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he added.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte said, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he said, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears said. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nSears said traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder said, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears said, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook said, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he said. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook said. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook said HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concluded. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Dissecting+the+employer+disconnect+in+HR+technology&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

HR technology, buyers remain unsatisfied with\noutcomes.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | March 9, 2020 \u2022 6 min read\n\nTopics: [HR

into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover $5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a $250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% say the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\n  \n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, says Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner. (Tinder will be among the presenters at the upcoming [Select HR\nTech](https://www.selecthrtech.com) conference in June.)\n\nTinder says her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n> \u201cYou can get the best product on the market and spend millions of dollars.\n> But if you don't have the right project partner and the right project plan,\n> it's going to fail.\u201d\u2014Bonnie Duncan Tinder, Raven Intel\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe says. In fairness, she notes, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don't have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn't matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder says. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don't have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it's going to fail.\u201d\n\n  \n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, says that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she says, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille says.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explains.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explains. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he adds.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Marcotte-head-\nshot-2019-250x167.jpg)\n\nScot Marcotte\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte says, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte says.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he says, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte says.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n> \u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\n> work together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and\n> people\u2014sense.\u201d\u2014Scot Marcotte, Buck\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears says. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted.

That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder says, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she says. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears says, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he says. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook says, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he says. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook says. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook says HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concludes. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n_To learn more about how to ensure success in your HR-tech projects, register\nfor_[ _Select HR Tech_](https://www.selecthrtech.com/topics) _, the new\nconference from the creators of_ Human Resource Executive\u00ae _and the HR\nTechnology Conference & Exposition\u00ae that debuts June 9-11 in Las Vegas._\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

The Fed\u2019s rate cuts added to an\nalready precarious yet highly desirable problem: an overabundance of cash in\nthe U.S. markets, which meant a [hoarding of\ncash](https://www.axios.com/money-companies-investors-assets-buybacks-\ndividends-f0a4d79b-bfa7-4205-9d27-f09b50266307.html) by corporate America. In\na sense, the quantitative easing was handed to us and corporate America rode\nthe wave of growth over profit without targeted discipline in management or\nbalance sheets.\n\nOne day last December, I heard a fascinating discussion among financial\nexperts about weak management, weak balance sheets and the upcoming \u201csqueezing\nout\u201d of poorly managed companies in 2020 and 2021 due to economic impact. Fast\nforward to today. How fast the markets change and catch us when we least\nexpect it.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles inexperienced executive teams face is recognizing\nthe value of strong management, which derails their ability to manage on pace\nwith corporate growth.\n\nThere are certain undeniable truths about management that every executive\nteam, private equity firm and venture capitalist could benefit from learning.\nManagement is an ethical, noble and highly experiential profession. Left\nmisunderstood, untrained and unattended, it will erode an organization by way\nof culture, systems and an unhealthy dependency on HR.\n\nThis is best illustrated through a company's financial strategy. Organizations\nwill pursue one of two primary financial strategies: top-line revenue or\nmargins.\n\n**Top-line revenue forces scale and growth.**\n\nA company in growth mode will generally employ a lower-wage workforce of less-\nexperienced talent to lower payroll expenses. Less-experienced workforces are\ngenerally prone to higher ancillary costs due to programs tailored to the\nworkforce:\n\n1\\. Purposeful manager selection criteria and processes.\n\n2\\. The greater need for manager training and development programs.\n\n3\\. A concerted plan and efforts for career pathing and employee progression.\n\n4\\. An amplified new-hire orientation program and professional development\nskills training.\n\nWhen the above programs are not implemented and given top-level support by\nexecutive leadership, the impending greater expenses include:\n\n1\\. High turnover.\n\n2\\. Low employee productivity.\n\n3\\. Increased number of worker\u2019s compensation (WC) incidents and claims\n(driving premium rates and EMOD higher).\n\n4\\. Poor recruiting.\n\n5\\. High-risk terminations.\n\nA company going after a top-line revenue financial strategy can create strong\nmanagement by recognizing the workforce it employs and giving top-level\nsupport to tailored workforce programs.\n\n**Squeezing margins forces efficiency.**\n\nA company targeting margins as its financial strategy will generally go after\nhigh-productivity employees \u2014 those who can do more with less because the\ntalent are more experienced, have specialized skills and adhere to efficiency\nprotocols. Higher compensation for this type of workforce is arguably better\nbecause the company is essentially running at a consolidated employee-to-unit\nof work ratio model:\n\nA company in growth mode operates at one employee to one unit of work.\n\nA company squeezing margins operates at one employee to three to five units of\nwork.\n\nThe ratio for a company squeezing margins means it will pay about 25\u201350% more\nin wages to one employee when compared to the low-wage workforce employee, and\nthe output of work will be at a higher quality and completed at a faster rate\nof output.\n\nIn a controlled environment, it offers savings on the P&L. Ancillary costs\nexist in this scenario as well, considering the differentiation in its\nworkforce:\n\n1\\. Attracting a more experienced, skilled workforce requires a targeted\nrecruiting process. Attracting talent at this level means engaging a\nrecruiting firm.\n\n2\\. Skilled, experienced workers mandate a robust benefits package.\n\n3\\. They also demand well-aligned compensation, and the company must commit to\na compensation strategy and enhanced experiences, including sabbaticals and\npositions abroad as applicable.\n\nIllustrating organizational financial strategies and exploring the unique\nneeds of their distinct workforces provides perspective on how management\nincubates in the organization. We can see how the growth of management can\ndevelop in strength or fall to weakness.\n\nWhen executive leadership fails to recognize the value concerted management\nprograms provide, they garner debilitating cycles of employee-relations\nconcerns and high turnover, creating a dependent relationship with their HR\nleader and department.\n\nThis dependency begins when untrained and inexperienced or poorly trained\nmanagers are promoted or put into a management position lacking critical\nleadership skills. For example, they may be ill equipped to handle employment-\nrelations concerns and not understand basic employee rights/protections such\nas [Title VII](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm) of the Civil\nRights Act. Not only do they incorrectly handle a situation, they say or do\nsomething that violates the employee's rights, creating massive liability for\nthe company.\n\nLet's run a scenario: We have a new, inexperienced manager responsible for the\noutput, scheduling, staffing and performance of a 12-person team in a call\ncenter. The manager, untrained at delivering feedback, tells their only\n18-year-old employee that they are too young to do a good job and then\nexplicitly compares this employee to the 22-year-old on the team who is\nperforming better because of their age.\n\nHR not only has to clean up the manger's missteps, but it also has to\nreactively train the manager on proper performance reviews, employment laws,\netc. This reactive approach promotes the beginning of a negative and toxic\nrelationship. The manager feels like HR is bossing them around and/or they are\nbeing disciplined and fights against it.\n\nI have unfortunately seen this dependency scenario repeatedly during the\ncourse of my career in emerging-growth and growth companies because of\nexecutive leadership's disregard for the management profession and its severe\nlack of planning in creating a selection process, selection criteria and\neducation for managers. Hence, managers of a company that is strategically\ntargeting financial growth through top-line revenue are subject to negative\ndependency on HR if mangers are not correctly selected, trained, educated and\ndeveloped. HR\u2019s positive impact on the organization through a preventive and\nproactive nature deteriorates as it works to catch the pieces of leadership\u2019s\nlack of awareness of the organizational workforce drivers and tools required\nto help it succeed.\n\nCorrecting, and often circumventing, this dependency is achieved through HR\ngaining a seat at the highest leadership levels and becoming a liaison for\nbusiness goals and financial strategy. Steadily, the organization will\nprogress in converting its goals and strategy to being highly proactive and\nleveraging its management and balance sheets against slower, weaker\ncompetition.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Christine Wzorek](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2019/08/Christine-\nWzorek_avatar_1565887979.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/christinewzorek/\n\"Photo of Christine Wzorek\")\n\n[Christine\nWzorek](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/christinewzorek/)\n\nPresident of [White Label Advisors](https://www.whitelabeladvisors.com) and\nAdvisoryCloud member.

Emond](//www.gallup.com/people/item.aspx?a=148145) and Ellyn Maese\n\n![COVID-19 Strategies and Policies of the World's Largest\nCompanies](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/rfpjezg9o0kd1bqawrhuca.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * New teams are critical for developing policies and providing information\n  * Learn COVID-19 protocols and business contingency plans\n  * Monitor impact and conduct assessments to sustain business function\n\n> _Gallup Managing Director Larry Emond_ _gathered the strategies and policies\n> of 100_ _members of the CHRO Roundtable, an organization that includes the\n> CHROs of more than 650 of the world 's largest companies, for their\n> responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The companies in this sampling average\n> $27 billion in revenue with 80,000 employees and most are global\n> organizations. This is what Emond found._\n\n### **Crisis Management Teams**\n\nMost organizations have created crisis management teams, task forces or\ncommittees with a response tailored to specific geographic regions. These task\nforces meet regularly to develop policies and provide information to leaders,\nmanagers and front-line employees regarding COVID-19 awareness, prevention,\nmanagement and hygiene practices.\n\nThese teams are also focused on management protocols and business continuity\nplans to guide current actions and forecast possible responses to future\nevents. In general, their protocols and plans include:\n\n  * developing succession contingencies for all major executives\n  * conducting business using virtual, video or audio capabilities\n  * restricting travel\n  * reducing to business-critical operations only\n  * moving critical operations to unaffected regions\n  * cross-training team members to perform critical functions in the event of an unexpected absence or quarantine of another team member\n  * documenting business-critical functions, processes or procedures in the event of an unexpected absence or quarantine of a team member\n  * distributing call center scripts and agent communications\n\nIf an employee is diagnosed with COVID-19, many companies have established\nprotocols like these:\n\n  * Require employees to report confirmed cases -- either of self or family member -- of COVID-19 to HR or management. The affected are typically required to stay home for 14 days and/or until cleared by a doctor to return to work with confirmation that there is no diagnosis of COVID-19.\n  * Isolate employees diagnosed at work; immediately disinfect objects they've touched; trace their contact with other employees, customers, and clients; and notify those who may have been exposed without releasing the diagnosed employee's name.\n  * Ask employees to log all contact with other employees or visitors in case they become symptomatic so that others can be informed of potential exposure.\n\n### **Travel Requirements**\n\nMost companies have recommended limiting personal and professional travel, and\nsome have assured workers they could decline professional invitations without\npenalty. Generally called soft bans, these partial travel restrictions have\nbeen issued with requests to inform HR of travel and avoid air travel, public\ntransportation and large gatherings, as well as 14-day self-quarantines\nfollowing travel to affected areas.\n\nHowever, hard bans are in effect in many companies, and travel to China,\nItaly, South Korea, Iran, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan has been prohibited.\nIndeed, most intercontinental travel -- and, more recently, even travel in\ngeneral -- has stopped for the time being, unless it's mission-critical.\n\n### **Business Impact**\n\nLeaders are holding additional meetings to monitor business impact in efforts\nto protect or sustain business functions. Many companies with facilities in\naffected areas have closed them and are canceling their own -- or their\nemployees' presence at -- conferences, events and face-to-face meetings. Some\nhave been able to move operations to unaffected locations.\n\nSimultaneously, CHROs are:\n\n  * monitoring supply chains or providers for potential impacts\n  * conducting ongoing supply chain risk assessment and operation impact assessment\n  * considering alternative suppliers\n  * preparing for shortages, transportation delays or communication delays\n  * approving additional budget for supplies or additional paid time off\n  * reducing or suspending bonuses for top earners\n  * analyzing and forecasting potential market impacts\n\n### **Wellbeing**\n\nCompanies are also assessing risks to their [employees' physical and financial\nwellbeing](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/288722/keep-remote-worker-\nwellbeing-high.aspx). Their mitigation efforts include:\n\n  * instituting mandatory work-from-home or [remote work](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/288956/covid-teams-working-remotely-guide-leaders.aspx) policies where possible\n  * closing on-site facilities such as gyms, cafeterias and common areas\n  * making revisions to employee compensation and benefits policies\n  * granting paid time off for symptomatic employees, employees who must care for family members who are diagnosed with COVID-19, and/or employees with diagnosed cases of COVID-19\n  * using standing sick leave, extended sick leave, vacation time, paid time off or flex-time policies\n  * increasing sick leave or paid time off for all or on a case-by-case basis\n  * utilizing short-term disability, family leave (FMLA) or other existing benefits\n  * recommending available Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)\n  * reminding employees about mental health services for [stress management](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/257501/charge-work-stress-starting-managers.aspx)\n  * using back-up care programs, childcare subsidies or other dependent care benefits\n  * refraining from penalizing time off of any kind\n  * permitting unlimited unpaid time off without penalty\n  * providing travel/international SOS (medical and travel security) services\n  * paying for time spent under quarantine\n  * [offering work-from-home options](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/263510/manage-remote-employees.aspx) or adjusting schedules due to school closures\n  * communicating employer-sponsored insurance and other relevant benefits\n  * advising employees to avoid public transportation\n  * staggering shifts to help employees avoid busy commutes\n  * advising employees to avoid visiting high-traffic events or locations on personal time\n  * reconfiguring meeting rooms, break rooms and other common areas to promote social distancing\n  * expanding the time of meal service to avoid congestion, and asking employees to consider alternate meal times to reduce crowds\n\n### **Technology**\n\nThese companies are testing technological (e.g., remote work) capabilities,\nemergency notification systems and updating employee contact information.\nThey're advising employees to take their laptops or other portable equipment\nhome each night, and they are devoting IT staff to help employees set up\nremote connections at home, sometimes on employees' personal computers.\n\nLeaders are holding additional meetings to monitor business impact in efforts\nto protect or sustain business functions.\n\nMany companies have required or are encouraging video or audio-conferencing\nmeetings (e.g., Skype, Zoom, Microsoft Teams) or phone calls in lieu of face-\nto-face meetings. They also recommend conducting collaborative projects by\nvideo or audio-conferencing, Google Docs, emails or other online channels.\n\n### **Communications**\n\nCorporate leadership is communicating frequently -- daily, weekly or as\navailable -- to address their organization's COVID-19 response, advice,\npolicies and protocols. Many are issuing FAQ guides, and many are including\nlinks to authorities and external organizations such as the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), The World Health Organization (WHO),\nJohns Hopkins University, local governments and outbreak maps.\n\nAlong with expert advice, these messages often include a genuinely personal\nelement, i.e., reminding workers to get information from credible\norganizations, assuring them that none of their fellow employees have tested\npositive for the virus (where applicable) and urging employees not to panic or\nspread rumors. They will also often encourage employees to obtain enough food,\nwater, medicines and other essentials for their families in case of quarantine\nor scarcity.\n\nCorporate leadership is communicating frequently -- daily, weekly or as\navailable -- to address their organization's COVID-19 response, advice,\npolicies and protocols.\n\nCommunications are usually tailored to the recipients -- whether leaders,\nmanagers, employees or clients/customers, respectively -- and methods include:\n\n  * social media for public messages\n  * email, mail, text messages, hotlines and internal systems (i.e., intranet) to propagate pertinent information\n  * signage to reinforce hygiene, screening and other organizational policies\n\nMembers of the CHRO Roundtable are conscious of the effects of their\ncommunication, particularly on customers. To that end, many have:\n\n  * Proscribed responses from managers/leaders if contacted by the media. Many have designated media relations personnel who address all questions from the media.\n  * Asked employees not to violate the privacy of diagnosed employees or clients/customers in social media messages.\n  * Deployed social media and marketing messaging about customer policies and alternative commerce/services.\n\n### **Training**\n\nBusinesses are rapidly expanding training opportunities. Much of it concerns\nmanagers, who are being tasked with assisting in coronavirus containment,\nresponding to employee needs or concerns, and communicating disease-management\npolicies and preventative measures, such as hygiene practices. But CHROs are\nalso creating COVID-19-specific training programs for security professionals,\ncleaning crews, maintenance and groundskeeping staff.\n\nThese protocols and responses, we're told, will be operational as long as is\nneeded -- the end of May is the current long-term projection -- and all are\nsubject to revision. Gallup will continue to report on our findings as the\nsituation evolves.\n\n### **Discover these crucial resources to better prepare your company during\nthis disruption:**\n\n  * [Watch our live webinar \"COVID-19: Managing Your Workforce Through Disruption\"](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/2227447/9B313EDC59F0101EBD44901C0C8CAB0B?parterref=article&utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_292334&utm_medium=copy) to get everything Gallup knows about disruption and other crises.\n  * Read about how to [manage the loneliness and isolation of remote workers in this article](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/268076/manage-loneliness-isolation-remote-workers.aspx).\n  * Read about \"The Changing Place and Space of Work\" in Gallup's [_State of the American Workplace report_](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-workplace-report-2017.aspx), which includes research on remote work trends and best practices.\n\nLarry Emond is Managing Director of Global Leadership Advisory at Gallup.\n\nEllyn Maese is a Research Associate at Gallup.\n\n_Jennifer Robison contributed to this article._\n\n[\n![](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/SPEEDBUMPS/jfrv8v85vegptqw9if7wcw.png)\nDeep Dive  What Is Employee Engagement, Really?

by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n\nThe spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has sparked conversations among\nemployers concerned about the wellbeing of their teams. Here are some common\nquestions employers are asking during this outbreak, which has been deemed a\npandemic by the World Health Organization.\n\n**Can employees be restricted from traveling to impacted countries?**\n\nAt this point, there have been numerous countries around the world impacted by\nthe coronavirus. While employers can limit business travel or cancel company\nevents, employees who plan to travel for personal reasons cannot be restricted\nfrom doing so. That said, as an employer, you may ask employees to notify you\nprior to any overseas travel. Furthermore, you may be able to take additional\nsteps to ensure the safety of everyone who is employed at your facility, such\nas implementing a work-from-home policy or other limited staffing plan.\n\n**[Read more from _HRE_ on\ncoronavirus](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/)**\n\nYou have the right to restrict an employee\u2019s ability to return to work if you\nfollow all legal requirements for doing so. You cannot request that an\nemployee provide a medical diagnosis. If you are unsure about your HR\npolicies, [talk to a lawyer](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/legal-advice.rl).\n\n**Can I legally restrict visitors to the workplace amid coronavirus\nconcerns?**\n\nWhile you likely have the right to insist that anyone who has a fever or flu\nsymptoms not visit your work facilities, it is advisable to ensure that any\nsuch policy is applied uniformly across all demographic groups. This includes\ncontractors, vendors and visitors. A posted policy should be visible to anyone\nentering your facility. You may wish to consider a hand-held temperature-\nscreening device, provided the use of such a device is legal in your state. A\nlocal lawyer can help you determine what is legal and appropriate in your\nspecific situation.\n\n[**RELATED** A collection of strategies to manage coronavirus in the\nworkplace](https://hrexecutive.com/a-daily-shot-your-covid-19-update/)\n\n**Does FMLA apply to employees who need to take off due to coronavirus\nillness?**\n\nIf the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) guidelines apply to your\nbusiness, employees may have leave benefits available to them. The reason the\ncoronavirus likely qualifies is that it is classified as a \u201cserious health\ncondition.\u201d Keep in mind, this may also apply if the employee requires time\noff to care for an immediate family member.\n\nIt is important to note that there may also be state laws that apply,\nespecially for those companies that aren't subject to FMLA. A local attorney\ncan explain which laws apply to your business.\n\n**Would my company be liable if an employee contracts coronavirus at work?**\n\nEmployees who contract coronavirus on the job, particularly healthcare\nworkers, may be entitled to collect workers' compensation. Because of this,\nemployers may be responsible for covering medical bills associated with the\ndisease if an employee becomes ill due to contact with someone in the\nworkplace. You may need to ensure you have spoken with a medical professional\nto assist you in determining if there is a relationship between the job and\nthe employee being stricken with the virus.\n\nEmployees may also be entitled to disability payments if such benefits are\npart of your overall benefits plan. Make sure you have verified any limits on\ncoverage and plan for any resources you may need to administer the program.\nYour insurance-plan provider may have additional guidance.\n\nLastly, employers should always seek to reduce potential tort claims by\nfollowing commercially reasonable practices. For example, if a particular\ngeographic area or industry is affected disproportionately by illness,\nemployers may collectively take extraordinary measures. It\u2019s probably not a\ngood idea to be the outlier in that case.\n\n**Do I need to pay an employee who misses work due to being quarantined?**\n\nWhether an employee must be paid during quarantine will depend, in large part,\non the benefits that you offer in relation to sick leave and applicable law\n(like FMLA). If you have workers who are exempt and they show up for work\nduring any given week and you send them home, you may still be required to pay\nthem for the entire work week. Employees who have a specific number of sick\ndays and/or personal days may also elect to use those benefits during a period\nthey are quarantined.\n\nThis is a good time to review your current benefits offering and see how many\nemployees have accumulated paid sick and personal leave time. Having this\ninformation can be helpful to ensure your business is not negatively impacted\nin the event numerous employees opt to take time off during a potential\noutbreak or threat to their health in the workplace.\n\nIt is also important to note that your state may have its own \u201csick leave\u201d law\nthat applies. An employment lawyer can help you determine if your policy meets\nthe legal standards in your state.\n\n**How can I communicate my global health-emergency policy as an employer?**\n\nYour company emergency policies should be clearly spelled out in your\n[Employee Handbook](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/form/employee-handbook.rl).\nThis can help ensure that employees at all levels understand what steps you\nbelieve will keep your workplace safe for everyone.\n\nWhile your HR policies should ideally always be up-to-date, this is a great\ntime to review all of the [HR\ndocuments](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/employers.rl) your company uses. It is\nalways a good idea to work with a lawyer when drafting or revising human\nresources policy.\n\nEnsuring that employees practice regular hand washing and that your facilities\nare properly cleaned may also help curb potential spreading of the virus. In\norder to help your team feel safe, keep hand sanitizer and disinfectant on\nhand, and ensure that your restrooms are stocked with the appropriate soap,\ntowels and toiletries. Additional guidance for businesses and employers can be\nfound through the [Centers for Disease Control &\nPrevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/businesses-\nemployers.html).\n\n_Charley Moore is an attorney and founder/CEO of Rocket Lawyer._\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fanswering-\nyour-legal-questions-about-coronavirus%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Answering+your+legal+questions+about+coronavirus&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fanswering-\nyour-legal-questions-about-coronavirus%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fanswering-\nyour-legal-questions-about-coronavirus%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

While Paychex Flex is a full suite of HR solutions, its open\nplatform delivers the flexibility that customers may need.\n\n**Pay-on-Demand:** Paychex customers can now grant employee access to earned\nwages before their scheduled payday thanks to a pay-on-demand solution. For\ncustomers who leverage this product, employees who enroll can request access\nto a portion of earned pay before the scheduled pay date and can then have\nthose funds deposited into a bank account, onto a debit card, into a mobile\nwallet, and more.\n\n**Help Center:** HR technology is a significant investment for any\norganization, making it critical that users easily understand how to use it as\npart of their normal workflow. The Paychex Flex Help Center gives users access\nto training resources and how-to tutorials within the application itself. It\nemploys natural language processing (NLP) and predictive learning to deliver a\nmore tailored, contextual experience. Customers have access to help materials\nin written, video, and tour-like deliverables and may choose which best suits\ntheir learning style.\n\n**Custom Dashboard:** Employees and administrative users can now tailor their\n[Paychex](http://hrtechnologist.com/news/performance-management-hcm/paychex-\nenhances-payroll-hr-with-new-solutions/) Flex dashboard experience by\nincorporating the information and tools most important to them. Users can\neither choose a layout built on persona-based dashboard templates or configure\ntheir own dashboard from scratch.\n\n**Document Management:** Paychex released its document management solution in\n2019 and has now added electronic signature capabilities to the tool.\nCustomers taking advantage of document management can now digitally capture\nsignatures for key company documentation, including Paychex forms and other\nuploaded business-related files. In addition to e-signature capture, customers\ncan also run on-demand audit reports that show the entire process, from the\ninitial log in through signature event. This additional reporting capability\ndelivers further signature verification and may help protect customers in\nresponding to legal challenges.\n\n**HR News:**[Benefitfocus Comes up With a New

Services at Ascender_**\n\nOrganisations are constantly dealing with change. Especially across Asia,\nconducting business can be a little more complicated sometimes, due to the\nrichness of and variety in cultural and social norms, economic systems,\nbusiness practices and governmental focus areas. Unlike in Europe where\nstandardisation is the goal between countries, Asia Pacific will remain\ndiverse and different for the foreseeable future, but that makes doing\nbusiness here far more interesting!\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Inna-Wahlberg-\nheadshot-1.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Inna-Wahlberg-\nheadshot-1.jpg)\n\nInna Wahlberg is the General Manager of Asia Services at Ascender.  \n---  \n  \nThis year, we can expect to see a similar pace of regulatory and technical\nchange as we have grown accustomed to in previous years, but we also expect to\nsee a heightened focus on employee wellness and engagement as an emerging\ntrend in the region. The continuously evolving regulatory landscape will keep\ncompliance on the forefront businesses in this region as well.\n\nTo help organisations prepare for upcoming changes, we will shed some light on\nwhat to expect in 2020, and why.\n\n**Enforcing accurate, timely pay**\n\nEmployees care deeply about their pay. This is fundamental. Getting pay right\nhas still proven quite difficult for organisations to achieve. We also see an\nemerging interest in pay equity across the region. Employees are starting to\npay more attention to the notion of equal pay for equal work, and they are\nbecoming more open to talking about this in the workplace.\n\nTo accomplish pay transparency, HR and payroll managers first need to\nestablish trust. In a \u2018gig economy\u2019 with a more contingent workforce\nconsisting increasingly of part-time or freelance team members, each\ncompensation package is unique, which means clear communication about the set-\nup of the total compensation package is critical.\n\nGiven the transformation in the way we work, legislators will also watch this\nspace closely, applying more scrutiny and stricter legislation to affected\nindustries in an effort to protect the workforce from adverse effects, such as\nwage theft. While more precise practices can add complexity to payroll,\ncompliance will ultimately help build employee confidence and enhance the\norganisation's reputation.\n\n**The importance of employee wellness**\n\nEmployee Health and Safety has been a key focus area in many organisations for\na number of years. However, in 2020, we are seeing a subtle but important\nshift towards focus on Employee Wellness. Wellness as a trend encompasses both\nphysical but also mental wellbeing and employees are starting to think more\nholistically about what this means for their workforce.\n\nWe now experience a growing emphasis on agile working across Asia. According\nto results from Randstad Workmonitor, 87% of Singaporeans said that having the\nautonomy to work at an offsite location increases their productivity,\ncreativity, and job satisfaction. Similar trends can be seen in other Asian\ncountries too. This puts more pressure on employers to provide better\nfacilities in support of such ways of working, and focus on personal health\nand flexible work arrangements. We also see many companies are already\nembracing the trend by incorporating more meaningful perks and employee\nbenefits to their portfolio.\n\nLast year, Microsoft in Japan implemented a four-day work week initiative,\nwhich, according to the company, led to a 40% boost in productivity. With\nglobal organisations leading the way with such policies, these discussions are\npoised to have a broader impact for businesses.\n\n**Impact of legislation**\n\nIn 2020 we expect the volume of statutory and legislative changes across Asia\nto continue to gradually increase, as the drive for increasing transparency\nfor employees with regards to payroll and HR policies grows, which in turn\nwill add complexity to businesses operating in the region. Additionally,\ndiverse local statutes are supplemented by additional cross-border regulation\nsuch as most notably the EU\u2019s GDPR, which will have an impact on how companies\noperate in the region.\n\nA sampling of key legislative changes that have already taken effect include\nSingapore, where the Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions for workers\nover 55 years of age will steadily increase each year to a new maximum level\nin 2030. In China, the government recently completed a significant overhaul of\nthe income tax system introducing more complexity in payroll management\nlocally. In Malaysia, when the Minimum Wages Order 2020 comes into effect, two\ndifferent sets of minimum wage rates will start to apply.\n\nWe expect similar changes to continue to occur in 2020 and beyond.\n\n**What does this mean for organisations in APAC in 2020?**\n\nIn 2020, organisations operating in APAC must increasingly start to shift\ntheir attention from merely managing the complex and continuously evolving\nregulatory landscape into topics like employee wellbeing and engagement.\nEngaged employees are likely to be much more productive and loyal. This is\nimportant because there is a clear linkage between a happy team and improved\nclient satisfaction. Happy employees provide great service, and that in turn\nboosts the company's bottom line.\n\nRegardless of where your business is based, it is imperative to remain\ncompliant both from legal, social, and individual perspectives. Those who can\nadapt quickly will thrive in this market over time.\n\n|  \n\n* * *\n\n  | [![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/pink1.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/pink1.png)  \n---|---|---  \n|\n\n**Ascender** is a Premium Sponsor of the upcoming  \n[HR Tech Festival Asia\n2020](https://www.hrtechfestivalasia.com/?utm_source=hrmasiablog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=HR%20Tech%20Festival%20Asia%202020%20-%20Blog%20Post)\n(29 \u2013 30 September, Singapore),  \nthe region\u2019s largest HR technology conference and exhibition.  \nLearn more about their solutions at the event.\n\n| [**Register to attend the event today!\n__**](https://www.hrtechfestivalasia.com/registration?utm_source=hrmasiablog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=HR%20Tech%20Festival%20Asia%202020%20-%20Blog%20Post%20Register)  \n---  \n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/blue1.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/blue1.png) |  |  \n|  |  \n---|---|---  \n|  |  \n|  |  \n  \n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2F2020-payroll-\nand-hr-trends-in-asia%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=2020+Payroll+and+HR+Trends+in+Asia&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2F2020-payroll-\nand-hr-trends-in-asia%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2F2020-payroll-\nand-hr-trends-in-asia%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

 * \n\nTop HR officials across the federal government have told the Office of\nPersonnel Management that a combination of scarce funding and the strictures\nof the General Schedule pay system constitute \u201csignificant obstacles\u201d to\npositive workforce outcomes, and that there must be a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d\nof the federal government\u2019s pay system.\n\nOPM this week published the [summary\nreport](https://www.chcoc.gov/sites/default/files/2019%20Human%20Capital%20Review%20Summary%20Report.pdf)\nof its fiscal 2019 governmentwide human capital review survey. In the report,\nOPM said that although agency officials are already seeing dividends from\ntaking a more data-driven approach to analyzing human capital management,\nagencies need more flexibility to make improvements.\n\n\u201cWhile comprehensive workforce needs analyses are maturing within the federal\ngovernment, the process of identifying emerging needs is challenging,\u201d the\nreport stated. \u201cConsequently, most agencies are just beginning to make\nprogress on skills gap assessment and mitigation . . . Recruitment and\nretention for hard-to-fill vacancies such as information technology and\ncybersecurity positions in particular, are concerns for many agencies.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, one of the biggest issues standing in the way of\nchange is the General Schedule pay system, which officials says affects\neverything from compensation and retention of existing employees to\nrecruitment of the next generation of federal workers.\n\n\u201cMany agencies view the current structure of the General Schedule to be a\nconsiderable obstacle when competing with the private sector for new talent\nand retaining high-performing employees,\u201d OPM wrote. \u201cParticularly in critical\noccupational areas, such as IT and cybersecurity, some agencies indicated that\nsalaries are too low to be competitive, even when combined with compensation\nand benefits.\u201d\n\nAs a result, many agencies have either established alternative pay systems or\nreceived special pay and hiring authorities to help meet their needs in\nmission-critical areas. But that has led to a two-tier system where agencies\nmust compete against each other in addition to the private sector for new\ntalent.\n\n\u201cMany agencies have secured congressional authority to establish alternative\npersonnel systems that better enable them to strategically manage their\nworkforces, but this has also caused problems for the agencies that must use\nthe General Schedule because they do not have access to those same tools,\u201d the\nreport stated.\n\nEven a wholesale change to how the federal government compensates its\nemployees likely would not be enough to meet the needs of agency HR leaders,\nhowever. Agencies already on alternative pay systems also reported recruitment\nand retention challenges, often specifically tied to scarce funding for HR and\npay.\n\n\u201cEven when flexibilities are available, agency funding issues may limit their\nuse,\u201d OPM wrote. \u201cFor example, in agency reports addressing cybersecurity\nskills shortages submitted to OPM this year, half of the [chief human capital\nofficers] agencies cited stringent budgets as a challenge to attracting and\nretaining cybersecurity talent. To address any federal pay disparity with the\nprivate sector that has caused recruitment or retention problems, 12 agencies\nplan to seek special rates for various positions.\u201d\n\nShare This:\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?picture=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.govexec.com%2Fmedia%2Fimg%2Fupload%2F2020%2F04%2F02%2F040220money%2Fopen-graph.jpg&name=Federal+HR+Leaders+Want+a+Comprehensive+Review+of+the+Government%27s+Pay+System&app_id=696264563763622&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.govexec.com&link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.govexec.com%2Fpay-benefits%2F2020%2F04%2Ffederal-hr-leaders-general-schedule-funding-significant-obstacles-human-capital-goals%2F164327%2F&display=popup&description=In+the+fiscal+2019+governmentwide+human+capital+survey%2C+agency+officials+said+a+lack+of+funding+and+the+General+Schedule+are+%22significant+obstacles%22+to+achieving+their+goals.)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.govexec.com%2Fpay-benefits%2F2020%2F04%2Ffederal-hr-leaders-general-schedule-funding-significant-obstacles-human-capital-goals%2F164327%2F&text=Federal+HR+Leaders+Want+a+Comprehensive+Review+of+the+Government%27s+Pay+System&via=GovExec)\n  * [](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.govexec.com%2Fpay-benefits%2F2020%2F04%2Ffederal-hr-leaders-general-schedule-funding-significant-obstacles-human-capital-goals%2F164327%2F&mini=true&summary=In+the+fiscal+2019+governmentwide+human+capital+survey%2C+agency+officials+said+a+lack+of+funding+and+the+General+Schedule+are+%22significant+obstacles%22+to+achieving+their+goals.&source=GovExec.com&title=Federal+HR+Leaders+Want+a+Comprehensive+Review+of+the+Government%27s+Pay+System)\n  * [](mailto:?body=In%20the%20fiscal%202019%20governmentwide%20human%20capital%20survey%2C%20agency%20officials%20said%20a%20lack%20of%20funding%20and%20the%20General%20Schedule%20are%20%22significant%20obstacles%22%20to%20achieving%20their%20goals.%0A%0Ahttps%3A//www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2020/04/federal-hr-leaders-general-schedule-funding-significant-obstacles-human-capital-goals/164327/&subject=Government%20Executive%3A%20Federal%20HR%20Leaders%20Want%20a%20Comprehensive%20Review%20of%20the%20Government%27s%20Pay%20System)\n  *   * \n\n**NEXT STORY:** [ In Case You\u2019re Wondering What You\u2019d Make in Retirement\n](/pay-benefits/2020/04/case-youre-wondering-what-youd-make-\nretirement/164325/?oref=ge-next-story)\n\n[ ![A commuter wears a face mask in the New York City transit system, Monday,\nMarch 9, 2020, in New\nYork.](https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2020/03/09/AP_20069635674540/261x157.jpg)\nDefense  OPM and Defense Guidance for Civilians on Coronavirus\n](/defense/2020/03/opm-and-defense-dept-issue-guidelines-civilian-employees-\ncoronavirus/163637/?oref=ge-earthbox-post)\n\n[\n![](https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2020/02/10/021020cuts/261x157.jpg)\nPay & Benefits  White House Revives Controversial Retirement Cut Proposals\n](/pay-benefits/2020/02/white-house-revives-controversial-retirement-cut-\nproposals/163015/?oref=ge-earthbox-post)\n\n[\n![](https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2019/09/11/Screen_Shot_2019-09-11_at_5.43.20_PM/261x157.png)\nPay & Benefits  Best Dates to Retire 2020\n](https://www.govexec.com/assets/best-dates-retire-2020/portal/)\n\n[\n![](https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2019/06/14/062016campaignbuttons-0/261x157.jpg)\nGovernment Executive  How Well Do You Know the Hatch Act?

Resources is at the front lines of employers\u2019 response to the COVID-19\ncrisis.\n\nThe crisis is forcing almost every business to immediately develop, adapt or\nimprove remote work policies and procedures.\n\nAs HR pros struggle to keep employees safe and informed, it helps to think\nabout what changes will be more permanent and how you\u2019ll guide employees and\norganizational leadership through those changes.\n\nHere are 5 effects that you\u2019ll likely be dealing with long after things return\nto \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\n## **Remote work will be a permanent feature for more organizations.**\n\nAnd that is a good thing, because in addition to workers moving to remote\ntemporarily as we weather this crisis, many will continue working remotely at\nleast part of the time after businesses re-open their doors.\n\nLuckily, for most employers, the technology and communications infrastructure\nneeded for successful remote work are available to employees.\n\nBut HR needs to start now, collaborating closely with Finance, IT and other\ndepartments to develop and implement new rules. Among the questions that need\nto be addressed:\n\n    * How will managers translate existing work rules, meeting schedules and communications strategies to the new reality?\n    * Who will pay for remote workers\u2019 connectivity and any required equipment, like printers, monitors, headset, etc.?\n    * How will you recover them if someone quits or is fired?\n    * How must job descriptions change to accommodate part- or full-time remote work?\n    * How will you monitor and enforce attendance?\n    * What HR functions must adapt \u2013 talent acquisition and development, discipline, benefits and compensation all introduce their own challenges in a remote work environment.\n\nAnd in the meantime, HR's role in monitoring and maintaining morale becomes\neven more crucial.\n\nIt is a good idea to create a formal process for checking in with remote\nemployees to ask how they are dealing with the added stress during the crisis\n-- and to keep on top of any issues after things return to a new normal.\n\nAre they staying in touch with their colleagues and manager? Do they need\nanything to help stay productive? Are they aware of available emotional health\nresources and how to access them?\n\nIt will also become clear over the coming weeks what jobs cannot be done\neffectively offsite. You\u2019ll need to start on contingency plans and work\npolicies for those, as well.\n\n## Nurturing culture gets more challenging in dispersed workplaces\n\nWorkers and business leaders tell researchers they believe a strong and [well-\ndefined organizational culture](https://www.hrmorning.com/lp/shaping-\ncorporate-culture-through-employee-\nrecognition/?utm_content=tembosocial-e1-03-23-2020&utm_source=Iterable&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=HR_TemboSocial_e1_03-23-2020&campaignId=1098421&udbId=&emailAddress=dG1jZWxndW5uQHBicC5jb20%3D)\nis critical to long-term success.\n\nIt sets the organization's identity, helps form its mission and gives\nemployees at all levels a sense of identity and purpose in their work.\n\nBut culture is also vulnerable in times of crisis when decisions are being\nmade on the fly and financial survival takes priority over almost everything\nelse.\n\nUnfortunately, culture is also impossible to automate -- there is no\ntechnology solution that can preserve and enhance organizational culture.\n\nEmployee engagement, [constant\ncommunication](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/employee-engagement-top-\nperformers/) and demonstrated commitment to your culture by leadership are the\nonly tools that will work.\n\nAnd workers will detect lip service even when they're working remotely and\nwill remember it after the crisis passes.\n\nIt is hard to put culture at the top of HR's priority list while you are\nputting out fires every day. But, if anything, culture is even more important\nnow and can hold your organization together over the long term.\n\n## Talent acquisition and retention remains critical\n\nWith the dire economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic becoming clearer by\nthe moment, companies and whole industries are laying off workers and freezing\nhiring.\n\nThat may require greater reliance on contractors and temp workers in the early\nstages of the eventual recovery. But [companies' reputations among the\ncandidates you'll need longer term](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/big-\ntime-talent-acquisition-on-a-small-budget-5-proven-steps/) will depend on how\nthey are treated during this crisis.\n\nThat may mean hiring some employees back as 1099 contractors in the short term\nor helping them sign on with temp agencies.\n\nEven in the midst of this uncertainty and turmoil, however, it's a good idea\nto keep your talent pipeline full and maintain contact with prospective\nrehires and new hires.\n\n## Engaging a remote workforce\n\n[Keeping employees engaged, enthused and productive\n](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/boost-employee-engagement-with-people-\nskills/)is one of HR's most valuable roles and, often, one of your team's\nsuperpowers.\n\nAnd research makes it clear that employees who feel that their physical and\nemotional wellbeing is a real priority for the organizations they work for are\nmore engaged.\n\nThat translates into real money.\n\nTwo decades of [Gallup research\n](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/284180/factors-driving-record-high-\nemployee-engagement.aspx)shows that highly engaged teams:\n\n    * produce substantially better outcomes\n    * treat customers better and attract new ones, and\n    * are more likely to remain with their organization than those who are less engaged.\n\nEngaged employees are also healthier, Gallup reports, and less likely to\nexperience burnout.\n\nYou can show workers at home you are committed to their wellbeing by adjusting\nbenefits.\n\nA great immediate step is to reduce or eliminate copays for\n[telehealth](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/benefits-package-future/)\nvisits. If you don't already include mental health consultations as part of\nyour telehealth plan, add it now.\n\nAnd, with financial stress impacting almost every employee, it is a good time\nto investigate options like daily pay, subsidized loans and free access to\n[financial education](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/shrm-2019-financial-\nwellness-benefits-employees-want-and-need/) webinars.\n\nLoyalty to your workers amid unprecedented stress and confusion will come back\nto you through their ongoing loyalty and dedication to your mission.\n\n## Accommodation and compliance\n\nWith the number of people working remotely exploding, employers face new\npolicy issues and, potentially, [very real employment law\nconcerns.](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/drafting-remote-work-\npolicy-5-legal-pitfalls/)\n\nPotential compliance issues include:\n\n    * Permitted employer actions under the ADA, FMLA, Title VII and other federal and state statutes and regulations.\n    * The important ADA concepts of \u201cdisability-related inquiries,\u201d \u201cmedical examinations,\u201d \u201cdirect threat,\u201d \u201cundue hardship and other similar terms.\n    * Leave policies and FMLA requirements.\n    * Acceptable teleworking arrangements to protect employees.\n\nYou'll need to keep track of all the new requirements in new laws coming out\nof congress, including the [Families First Coronavirus Response Act\n](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/families-first-coronavirus/)that takes\neffect on or by April 2, 2020.\n\nTaking effective action requires leaders to conduct advanced planning and make\nstrategic management decisions, all of which will rely heavily on the advice\nand insight only HR can provide.\n\n## Additional resources\n\n[Coronavirus (COVID-19) Resources for HR\nProfessionals.](https://www.hrmorning.com/coronavirus-resources/) Keeping\nyourself and your team educated and informed during times of uncertainty is\nimportant.

Being part of a company, whose entire mission was to help\npeople find their right fit position was incredibly appealing to me, and\nSnagajob\u2019s culture had a reputation for being second to none. After joining, I\nwas able to take on new opportunities and expand my scope into a more\ncomprehensive people role, and I currently head up people and workplace,\nbasically, everything that involves being an employee of Snagajob rolls\nthrough this team.\n\nMy personal philosophy has always been that if you\u2019re going to do something,\ndo it the best way you possibly can, settling for a final product that\u2019s just\n\u201cfine\u201d isn\u2019t my style, and fortunately, it\u2019s not the style of Snagajob. It\u2019s a\nstandard my team embodies, and all our strategic actions are designed to\nenable \u201cSnaggers\u201d to do their best. Not only that, Snagajob\u2019s core value of\n_Unconvention_ encourages Snaggers to take smart risks and find the best\npossible outcome, and our value of _Fire_ makes creating exceptional\nexperiences for everyone the norm and not the, well, exception!\n\n**With higher demand for flexi-time, remote work and better work-life balance,\nwill 2020 mark the end of the traditional workday? What are the top 3\nstrategies talent leaders need to put in place for a smooth transition into\nflexible work?**\n\nI think the traditional workday is already gone. If you\u2019re not able to meet\nyour talent where they are- at least partially, you\u2019re not going to be able to\nbe competitive in this tight labor market. If this is something new to your\norganization, there are a few things that need to happen:\n\n  * Your organizational culture needs to support this concept. If HR understands the importance of workplace flexibility, but managers aren\u2019t adapting, it won\u2019t be successful. Change management will of course vary from org to org, but bottom line, everyone must be on board.  \n\n  * From a logistical standpoint, you should make sure your employees have the technological capabilities and training to work remotely. Most companies use a unified communications system to host meetings and calls, but it can be difficult to utilize these tools without the proper instruction. Don\u2019t be afraid to invest in training and host regular check-ins to make sure all employees are feeling supported and proficient, especially those who haven\u2019t spent much time in the office (or other locations)!  \n\n  * Understanding that you don\u2019t have to go this alone! Find a trusted partner, especially if you\u2019re diving into this the first time, who can help launch this. Someone who\u2019s done it before and has expertise in the space you\u2019re in will make it much easier to implement.\n\n**In today\u2019s uber-competitive job scenario, what are the pain points of HR\nmanagers when it comes to recruiting hourly workers? How can HR analytics and\non-demand platforms help ease these challenges?**\n\nFinding high quality applicants continues to be the top challenge for hourly\nhiring managers. Employers don\u2019t have weeks, or sometimes even days, to fill\ntheir most important roles, so a quick, easy to use solution is more important\nthan ever. The right data can quickly solve that. Knowing when workers are\napplying, understanding the best way to reach them, and having the data at\nyour fingertips that clearly and concisely outlines their fit to your role.\n\nFor example, if your candidates are most active before 9am, but you\u2019re not\nresponding to them until the next day, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve lost a\nchunk of them to other opportunities. The right analytics will help you reach\nthem more quickly and have a better chance of landing them. Hiring workers on\ndemand, especially in fast paced environments like restaurants, is really an\nideal solution to this too. Hiring managers can easily scale up during busy or\ncrunch periods, and it\u2019s a perfect way to show potential employees why you\u2019re\na great place to work!\n\n**Learn More:[How to Manage Your Staff Effectively in the Age of Automation:\nQ&A; With Insticator\u2019s CEO, Zack\nDugow](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/mobile-workforce/zack-dugow-\ninsticator-on-managing-employees-effectively/)**\n\n**Can a robust HRMS help payroll managers consider the cost of benefits,\ntraining, taxes, and other such expenses to roll out a progressive\ncompensation strategy for flexi-time employees?**\n\nA system that helps you understand your comprehensive costs is certainly\nimportant those tangible costs are crucial, and help managers plan a\ncompensation strategy accordingly. This can be especially useful for staffing\nup for peak periods or managing overtime. They won\u2019t show the whole picture\nthough, employees with flexible schedules are more engaged and are more likely\nto stay. Plus, there\u2019s a ton of data showing engaged employees are more\nproductive, which will have a positive impact on your bottom line.\n\n**Hourly employees may not have time to take a full-length training course.\nWhat role can micro-learning platforms play to meet the learning needs of this\nsection of talent?**\n\n> **This goes hand in hand with flexible/remote work! It\u2019s all about meeting\n> talent where they are many people use mobile devices as their primary means\n> of internet access, and training that is easy to access from those devices,\n> especially when they\u2019re presented in short formats, give even more people\n> the ability to participate.**\n\n**Hourly/contract workers are not only being recruited for entry-level roles,\nbut also taking up more strategic roles. Is that something you see as a\npassing phase or a growing trend?**\n\nIt\u2019s here to stay! There are already companies who make hiring a contract\nworker really easy for any variety of roles, whether it\u2019s landscaping or\nengineering, and it\u2019s a part of strategic workforce planning for many\norganizations (ours included) to enable them to iterate quickly, or ramp up\nwhen there\u2019s a special project that may not require a full time employee.\nPlus, more and more workers are looking for flexible work, so it\u2019s a great\nopportunity to gain access to talent you might not normally be able to hire!\n\n**What are the new workplace realities be it policy making, retention\nstrategy, payroll, workforce management that an HR manager must understand\nwhen it comes to hourly workers?**\n\nThere are so many, but a few really stand out to me:\n\n  * Flexibility is important and being adaptable to an increasingly on-demand workforce will be key. While many people want full time jobs, gig work is here to stay, and managers are going to have to take advantage of this in an increasingly tight labor market- finding a full time employee might not be easy, but you can still keep your business thriving with shift-based workers.  \n\n  * Pay transparency is becoming a non-starter. Workers want to understand up front what they\u2019ll earn, and want to know they\u2019re paid fairly, so transparency around this at the start matters.  \n\n  * Changing labor laws. There\u2019s a lot in flight all over the country, from new definitions of protected classes to predictive scheduling and new minimum wage laws. While many take times to implement, being aware of what\u2019s on the horizon will help managers stay ahead of any process changes they may need to make.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Can Distributed Teams Outperform Traditional Teams?

How can HR leaders gear up for the future of contractual talent?**\n\nThere\u2019s so much happening in this space that it\u2019s hard to narrow it down! The\nones I\u2019m paying the most attention to are:\n\n  * Expansion of on-demand and flexible work in less traditional industries. While everyone\u2019s familiar with on-demand drivers, this will become ubiquitous everywhere as the talent market gets increasingly tighter.  \n\n  * Clarity, or lack thereof around 1099 vs W2 for on-demand workers. Lawmakers around the country are tackling this, and I expect this to continue into 2020. In the meantime, HR leaders should be mindful of classification of workers, including how any on-demand partners classify them.  \n\n  * Increasing accessibility to HR tech by both workers and employers. Quick, easy access to traditional HR paperwork and materials will streamline every aspect of traditional HR process.\n\nIf HR leaders haven\u2019t already started having these conversations within their\norganizations, now is the time to start. Flexible work is becoming an\nincreasingly important part of how we do business, and leaders who are\nprepared for any change management that their organizations require are\nputting themselves in the right spot to succeed.\n\n**_Neha:_** _Thank you, Candace, for sharing your valuable insights on how HR\nleaders can get ready for the future of remote work and flexi work.

you had a knee-jerk reaction to a surprise? Maybe you\nwere startled (in a good way) when a friend you hadn\u2019t seen recently walked in\nthe door unannounced. Perhaps you were less pleasantly jolted by water gushing\nfrom a ceiling leak or a snake that had camouflaged itself to mimic a tree\nroot you were stepping over on a trail.\n\nThe world is experiencing a collective knee-jerk reaction as effects of the\ncoronavirus spread through society, drastically affecting businesses and\ndriving people into their homes to try to stay safe.\n\n## What will happen to the employees?\n\nMany manufacturers have temporarily closed or are changing production.\nRestaurants, hospitality providers and retail stores are [facing tough\ntimes](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/20/us-industries-being-\ndevastated-by-the-coronavirus-travel-hotels-food/111431804/). The risk of\n[mass bankruptcies](https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-just-doubled-the-risk-\nof-mass-bankruptcies-123827521.html) could double.\n\nDespite the dizzying contractions taking place in the business world, the\ncoronavirus will eventually be brought under control. People will need to eat;\nroads, offices and buildings will need to be constructed; appliances and\nautomobiles will need to be made.\n\nHaving a knee-jerk reaction to the coronavirus now will only hurt business\noutcomes in the long run. It\u2019s not the easiest time to think long-term about\ncompensation and benefits, but it\u2019s necessary to force yourself to look beyond\nthe immediate crisis toward a total rewards strategy.\n\n## Wage and benefit continuity matter\n\nTalk of the pandemic is unavoidable these days, but it\u2019s important to\nrecognize where your employees\u2019 biggest fears lie, says [Amanda\nWethington](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandawethington/) of Korn Ferry.\n\nAn [Emerson College/Nexstar poll](http://emersonpolling.com/2020/03/19/march-\nnational-poll-70-of-americans-worried-about-catching-coronavirus/) found that\n42% of Americans surveyed were \u201cvery concerned\u201d about personal finances,\ncompared to 26% about personal health. Combine that with the fact that 60% of\nthe working population has less than $1,000 in savings, and it\u2019s clear that\nreward systems are an issue that existed before coronavirus descended (and one\nthat will be around long after).\n\n**Existing challenges to wage continuity**\n\nSome challenges to wage continuity predate the coronavirus pandemic, such as:\n\n  * 70% of US hourly workers don\u2019t have sick leave\n  * Staffing shortages and absenteeism issues\n  * The gaps created by gig economy pay arrangements\n  * Poor communication and decision-making in some businesses \n\nHere are some actions being taken given the disruption of the coronavirus:\n\n  * Sick leave policies are being reviewed and reassessed\n  * Shift policies are being reconsidered, as are compensation rates for hourly workers\n  * Processes and equipment allocations are under review, especially for positions where remote work is not an option, such as health care\n  * Catastrophe pay is being mulled\n  * Supplemental payments and benefit continuation arrangements are becoming more of an option\n\n## Different industries face different reward system hurdles and opportunities\n\n[Mark Quinn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-quinn-8853396/) of Korn Ferry\nnotes that reward systems considerations faced by human resources vary by\nindustry.\n\nManufacturing must lead from the top regarding pay reductions, Quinn notes,\nand be timely about entering into negotiations with unions.\n\nThe service industry, on the other hand, should make employee safety a primary\nfocus. The industry should also seek to structure temporary layoffs, taking\nadvantage of any state support that is available. This industry is also\nuniquely positioned to take advantage of hiring increases as organizations\nsuch as [CVS, Amazon and Tesco](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/hiring-\ncompanies-seek-thousands-employees-amid-coronavirus-\npandemic/story?id=69767851) seek to meet heavy demand.\n\nFinancial services can implement staff rotations and defer salary increases\nand bonus payments. This sector should also provide mental health support (as\nshould all sectors).\n\nFor health care, which has shouldered the brunt of this crisis, the front line\nworkers have to be supported, says Quinn. The public and private sectors\nshould unite to ensure services can be provided. The sector must pare down\noperationally to the priority at hand, putting aside nonemergency business\nmatters.\n\n## Regardless of the industry, some common principles apply\n\nEach industry has its own difficulties to navigate, but communicating well can\nfortify an organization to get through the problems brought on by this\npandemic. Following a four-part framework can turn \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d into a\ncalmer, more methodical plan, says Wethington.\n\nFirst, make the immediate changes that will provide support to the continuity\nof labor while also addressing the realities of such an abrupt shift. It\u2019s\ntempting to immediately resort to across-the-board salary or job cuts. This is\nnot always avoidable, but it is smart to consider other options that are less\ndamaging to employee morale and less likely to make the business look panicky.\n\u201cLook at your reward strategy and involve the team of leaders to determine the\nwhat, the why and the how of labor cost management programs,\u201d she recommends.\n\nSecond, develop a \u201cmulti-pronged approach\u201d to managing labor costs. Layoffs\nare the traditional choice, says Wethington, but there are multiple other\noptions. These include reducing hours, unpaid leaves/sabbaticals, reducing\nreliance on contractors, doing away with overtime, delaying bonuses or\nsuspending benefits such as retirement savings.\n\nThird, weigh the effects of your cost management choice against the risk to\nemployee relations, \u201cnot just to the employees being affected, but to the\norganization as a whole.\u201d\n\nFinally, incorporate care and empathy when applying whatever reward change you\nmake.\n\n## Communication always matters\n\nThis is a time that calls for gut-wrenching decisions on the part of leaders.\nEven when you have to deliver bad news, keep employee well-being at the\nforefront, says Don Lowman of Korn Ferry. Take a balanced perspective, because\nthere will be a turnaround, he says. This pandemic will pass, and when it\ndoes, the effects of your discipline in avoiding a knee-jerk reaction will\nshow.\n\nFinally, lead by example. [John\nMurdock](https://www.smartbrief.com/branded/77F8DA5B-9982-431B-9E20-444163A3CF79/D027BAE8-D557-4A3C-9FB7-F7F679C28753)\nbecame the CEO of Centage virtually overnight when his predecessor (and dear\nfriend) passed away. He was coping with the expectations of employees who were\nshocked and grieving at a time when he was too. \u201cEven though on any given day\nI have a million things to attend to, I make time to walk the floor, talk to\npeople and generally let people know I\u2019m available. It\u2019s disingenuous to state\nyou want a collaborative and transparent environment but then have no time to\nconnect with people,\u201d says Murdock.\n\nThis is a difficult time for almost every business. It\u2019s tempting to leave\nquestions about reward systems for calmer moments. Take the time now to\naddress them, and you\u2019ll find your post-pandemic world much more rewarding.\n\n(Concepts in this post are adapted from \"[Employing Agile Reward Strategies\nfor a Volatile\nWorld](https://infokf.kornferry.com/REG_WBR-2020-03-24-Coronavirus-Webinar-\nSeries-5_CHALL_GBL_GL_Other_MoFu_On-demand-Employing-agile-reward-\nstrategies.html?utm_source=marketo&utm_medium=email&utm_term=&utm_content=&utm_campaign=20-03-covid),\"\na Korn Ferry webinar.)\n\n_Paula Kiger edits SmartBrief's nonprofit sector newsletters and co-\nmanages[@SBLeaders](https://twitter.com/SBLeaders) on Twitter.

COVID-19\npandemic. Layoffs are often reflexive first measure to reduce costs. This is a\nmistake. Instead, leaders should take several steps before cutting headcounts.\nFirst, be clear about the challenge with staff; second, brainstorm ideas for\nhow to reduce costs while saving jobs; third evaluate other options like four-\nday work-weeks, unpaid time off, and son. Finally, have \"ice in the belly,\"\nwhich means you should keep your cool as a decision maker while also remaining\ncompassionate and empathetic with your staff.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/03/Mar20_19_1206948532-3.jpg)\nSanchit Khanna/Hindustan Times/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/03/the-coronavirus-crisis-doesnt-have-to-lead-to-\nlayoffs?language=es)\n\nWe\u2019ve made our [coronavirus coverage](/insight-\ncenter/coronavirus?ab=articlewidget-insightcenter-coronavirus) free for all\nreaders.

For weeks, our corporate clients and contacts waved off concerns\nabout a potential economic impact from the Covid-19 outbreak. Then something\nchanged around March 9. First, our contacts told us they were restricting\nvisitors to their offices and encouraging remote work. Now, only a few days\nlater, we are hearing that many them are considering layoffs to ensure they\nmake it through the crisis \u2014 and a recent\n[survey](https://www.pwc.com/us/covid-19-survey?WT.mc_id=CT1-PL52-DM1-TR1-LS4-ND30-PRG6-CN_CFOPulseSurvey-&eq=CT1-PL52-DM1-CN_CFOPulseSurvey)\nfound that a vast majority of corporate leaders are considering some sort of\nfinancial action as a result of the pandemic.\n\nTo be sure, a cost-cutting reflex is understandable. Leaders are obligated to\nmake responsible decisions to keep their companies afloat. But those who\nmanage the economic effects of this crisis in a clear and compassionate way\ncreate more value for their companies and will come out of this pandemic\nstronger than ever before. So before announcing deep layoffs, we recommend\nthat you consider these measures first.\n\n**Communicate Openly**\n\nMany leaders assume that if they admit that the company is facing turbulent\ntimes it will scare away its best employees. The assumption is that these\nemployees will worry less if management holds their cards close to their\nchest. Nothing could be further from the truth. Everyone knows that we are\ngoing through a global pandemic. Everyone knows certain sectors of the economy\nare already getting hit hard by changes in consumer behavior as a result of\nthis virus. And everyone knows a slowdown in parts of the economy and\nincreased uncertainty might impact their company as well.\n\nInstead of forcing your employees to second-guess what might be in store for\nthem, be utterly clear with them about the financial health of your firm and\nwhat goals you will prioritize. These goals will not be the same for every\ncompany, and you shouldn\u2019t communicate empty statements you don\u2019t believe in,\nsuch as \u201cwe put our employees first.\u201d These statements can be confusing and\neven counterproductive when people are worried about their jobs. It\u2019s better\nfor you to be specific. For example, if your goal is to save jobs while\nmeeting your bank covenants, say that. If it is to make a series of changes\nswiftly to shore up job security, clarify that you are prioritizing that\ndecision over other, slower changes.\n\n**Share the Pain**\n\nIf you are doing cut backs to save job losses, you must lead by example and do\ncut backs that impacts your own day-to-day as well. If you don\u2019t, there is a\ndanger that your staff will feel like saps, doing sacrifices while the C-suite\ncontinues unaffected. Get a commitment for a pay cut from your senior leaders.\nAs CEO, you should take the largest salary cut yourself. Several airline CEOs,\nfor example, are temporarily [forgoing\nsalaries](https://www.hcamag.com/us/news/general/more-airline-ceos-take-pay-\ncut-amid-outbreak/216929) or taking pay cuts amid looming cutbacks for the\nindustry.\n\n**Consider Crowdsourcing Ideas with Employees**\n\nIt can be overwhelming to open the floor for ideas from employees on what the\ncompany should do. You might fear that employees will be resentful if their\nideas are not selected. You might also fear that asking your employees for\nideas means that you will appear to have less control. We know one CEO who\nslapped down the idea of such open consultation, saying, \u201cParticipation is one\nthing, pandemonium is another.\u201d But crowdsourcing doesn\u2019t have to be\nequivalent to chaos. In our experience, it is critical that you ask your\nemployees to voice their ideas. By showing them, not just saying, that you\ncare about what they think, you will have stronger buy-in for the initiatives\nyou eventually prioritize.\n\nFor example, when Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) undertook a\ncrowd-sourcing  approach to cost-cutting following the 2008 financial crisis,\nmost of the comments were positive; indeed, employees appreciated the openness\nso much that they defended the moves to disgruntled colleagues who wanted to\nlash out or sabotage the process.\n\nTo begin the crowdsourcing process, leaders should offer structure by\narticulating that you intend to prioritize initiatives with lower capital\nrequirements, lower risk profiles, proven positive impact on cash flow, higher\nchances of saving jobs, and so on. Then truly demonstrate that you are open to\nthe ideas of the staff.  You might even present the final packages to the\nstaff and let them indicate their preferences between the various options. The\nbottom line is, you lose no control by this kind of approach. You enhance your\nstanding as a leader.\n\n**Review All the Options (Even the Less Conventional Ones)**\n\nBefore layoffs, consider all your non-obvious options for reducing cost. A\nfour-day work week for roles where you have excess capacity will reduce staff\ncost by nearly 20% (assuming some costs will remain due to overhead and\nbenefits). Some employees might agree to working half-time if they know that\ndoing so will save jobs.\n\nYou can also offer employees the opportunity for unpaid leave if they so wish\n\u2014 framing this leave as a \u201csabbatical\u201d can help take some of the stigma of the\nabsence away. In fact, you might find that some employees welcome these\noptions and wish they could have had them all along. By making it clear that\none of your overriding goals is to avoid layoffs, you might find that\nemployees are amenable to the personal sacrifices inherent in salary-increase\nfreezes, halting bonuses, bans on overtime, pausing of payments into\nretirement funds, reduction of vacation days, and other cost-saving measures.\n\nConsider decelerating pay decreases for lower salary ranges to protect\nemployees who are the most vulnerable. For example, you might reduce salaries\nof your highest paid employees by 10%, mid-range salaried employees by 5%, and\neveryone else above a certain threshold by half of that. This is what was done\nat BIDMC during its cost-reduction\u2014and employees appreciated that senior\nleaders tried all sorts of creative approaches to minimize head-count\nreduction.\n\n**Have \u201cIce in the Belly\u201d**\n\nBeing a leader in turbulent times can be nerve wracking. If you act too fast,\nit might turn out that you overreacted. If you act too slow, the business\nmight go under. It would be wise to have what in Swedish is called _Is i\nmagen_ , \u201cice in the belly,\u201d roughly translated as your ability to keep your\ncool in a critical situation.\n\nFirst, recognize that as bad as things look, government assistance may be\nforthcoming. Many business leaders recall that there was resistance toward\neconomic stimulus packages in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Part\nof that resistance was due to public resentment towards bailing out financial\ninstitutions that had caused the crisis. The public is more likely to be\nsupportive of economic stimulus packages in the current case where the\ndownturn is hard to blame on one particular industry. And economic aid might\nalso be targeted towards companies that can prevent layoffs.\n\nFurthermore, don\u2019t treat all negative indicators for your business the same.\nIf your client is a movie theater and they need to pause your project, you\nhave reason to believe they will not be able to pick the project back up\nanytime soon since the theater industry is taking a big financial hit.\nHowever, if your client is a hospital that says they\u2019d like to pause your\nproject so that they can focus on the high volume of patients at the moment,\nit\u2019s worthwhile showing their management team that you understand their\ncurrent priorities.\n\nIt\u2019s also reasonable to explain to them that you are trying to understand what\nthe economic impacts of this pandemic will be on your firm and ask them if\nthey can have an open discussion with you to help you understand how likely it\nis that they will continue the project once things calm down.\n\nBut _Is i magen_ does not mean that you are cool to the needs of your staff.\nThis is a time to show empathy, rather than maintaining an emotional distance\nfrom your people. Lead with compassion, especially for the most vulnerable\nmembers of your company. One common misconception is that most people\nprimarily look out for themselves in turbulent times. On the contrary, our\nexperience is that during a crisis, individuals overwhelmingly prefer to make\nsacrifices if it means that their company can help more of their colleagues\nkeep their jobs.\n\nGoing through a downturn and making tough decisions to keep your company\nafloat is hard. However, if you lead with compassion you will touch the lives\nof your employees in an extraordinary way and come out of this potential\nslowdown stronger than ever before, enhancing the shared values of your staff.\n\n* * *\n\n[Atta Tarki](/search?term=atta%20tarki&search_type=search-all) is the founder\nand CEO of specialized executive-search and project-based staffing firm\n[ECA](https://eca-partners.com/).

Images)\n\nAs leaders right now, we are doubly challenged. We must run our business, but,\nof course, in a new uncharted world. While we are still in the business of\nmaking money, most of how we did that a month ago is irrelevant. The way we\nnow need to work is more than just adapting to the work processes we had in\nplace last week, as we moved to our new virtual workforce. Traditional methods\nabout employee performance must be jettisoned in favor of a refocus on the\nwhole person. Your employees aren\u2019t just going through\n[COVID-19](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/) as employees; they\nare going through as full people. We must change how we lead and how we work\nto adapt to this new reality and not retreat back to our past ways as the\nmarket corrects. Yesterday, we were leaders and employees, but today we are\nall humans scrambling forward.\n\n**We need different instincts to be successful and get through this.**\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Scott-Cawood-\nheadshot-106.jpg)\n\nScott Cawood\n\nTo start, we need to respond, not react. Turning the \u201crespond\u201d button on means\ncalming the world around us down by finding the right info and providing\nguidance and reassurance for the full person. This requires a constant flow of\ncommunication and continual updating about the whole experience, not just the\nparts that apply to work. Decision-making is now happening every four hours.\nBusiness metrics of organizations require constant updating; waiting for a few\ndays or weeks to get status updates could be catastrophic. We need to lead at\nthe pace and velocity that the world around us is changing.\n\n**This new reality is an[opportunity](https://hrexecutive.com/averbook-\ncoronavirus-is-the-biggest-opportunity-in-our-careers/).**\n\nOne thing has become abundantly clear as offices empty out and workers set up\ntheir \u201cdesks\u201d remotely: People are a businesses\u2019 most important asset. The\nempty cubes and hallways are a stark reminder that people are indeed the life\nof the business. And, the world is watching how they are being treated when\nthe curtains are pulled back and we are all at our most vulnerable point. Now\nis the time to recognize that companies are compelled to look at employees as\nwhole people, not just stakeholders and profit centers. Your competitive\nadvantage now is how you take care of your people\u2014but not only during this\npandemic, but after as well, when business returns to normal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, of course, this is business as not normal. So now, leaders must:\n\n**Look for ways to engage the full person** : Their safety and health is their\ntop priority now, and it should be yours, too. Addressing employee fear helps\nmorale. They\u2019re worried about their health, their families and, of course,\ntheir work today and the stability of the workplace tomorrow. Leaders must\ntalk to the individual\u2014with all their concerns\u2014as a whole person, not just as\nemployees. Communicate often\u2014daily, or more frequently, as necessary. And act\nin ways that demonstrate the depth of care that often gets sidelined due to\nthings being \u201cbusiness, not personal.\u201d\n\nAnticipate employees\u2019 immediate needs. Some may get sick, or need to care for\nloved ones. Not everyone has paid time off. Find ways to help. Find ways to\nprotect. Our senior management team donated half of their accumulated paid\ntime off days to employees who may need it to take care of themselves or their\nfamilies, for example.\n\n[**Also see:** The new reality of remote work and\ncaregiving](https://hrexecutive.com/the-new-reality-of-remote-work-and-\ncaregiving/)\n\nEquip employees with the tools they need to work at home and the leeway to do\nit their way. With schools and childcare centers closed, realize that working\nwith rambunctious children in the next room\u2014or even the same one\u2014is where work\nwill get done. And yes, the occasional pet will indeed attend a virtual\nmeeting. The work ecosystem is stressed and most traditional management\nmethods of how work is done, including performance, merit processes, and\nworking 9-5 are, for all intents and purposes, retired. Managers who focus on\nthe arrival and departure time each day are going to lose their minds if they\ncannot break out of the belief that work is Monday through Friday, 9-5, and\nwhen you work is more important than how you work. Trust that work cultures\nwill change, and many organizations have already made numerous structural\nshifts to accommodate more flexibility in how and when people work\u2014and then\nthe rest of the world\u2019s organizations caught up last week, when the workplace\nas we knew it shut down.\n\n**Reimagine command and control.**\n\nDecisions have to be made at warp speed, which requires a flatter organization\nwith most authority being pushed down to the people closest to the customer. A\ncontrol hierarchy (monitoring what time employees get to their desks and what\ntime they leave) doesn\u2019t work. Flatter organizations have inherently more\noptions because they do not have as much of a chance to be polarized by\ncompeting vice presidents. You don\u2019t need to give up titles to flatten an\norganization because the things that need to be \u201cflat\u201d are elements like\ncommunication, access to information, opportunity to learn, getting recognized\nfor great work, being able to bring your full self into work and having a true\nstake in your future. Push out more authority to more people to make\ndecisions, even though they are now working from their living rooms. This will\nresult in a sense of purpose for employees and continuously build capability\nthroughout the organization, not just at the top.\n\n**Protect your people.**\n\nEvery CEO has a hard decision coming her or his way: to reduce staff or try to\nretain them despite the financial implications. We all must acknowledge that\ntraditional organizational metrics have to change now\u2014at the individual, team\nand organizational levels. Corporate profitability must be set aside for the\nnext year as organizations invest what reserves they do have in their people.\nThe bar for most global organizations is no longer big profits, but to remain\nviable. Further, existing reward and compensation programs must be redirected\nto align with our current reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRethink people processes like annual merit reviews and performance feedback\nand replace them with touch points aimed at providing updates and transparency\nin your business. The more you let your systems remain on auto pilot, the more\nyou will miss engaging with the full person. Performance reviews are not as\nimportant as protecting the jobs and health of your most important asset.\nThere will be an impact to many bottom lines in Q1 and Q2, and maybe more, but\nreducing staff must be the last consideration, not the first. This is easier\nif you rethink the importance of profit, margins and stakeholder value and\nprioritize your people. As a leader, your new No. 1 priority is doing\neverything possible to protect the job and the health of your people and\ncustomers. Know that business will return, the market will bounce back at some\npoint and those companies that have done the right thing are poised to build\ngreater momentum.\n\nInstead of reducing headcount, encourage managers to:\n\n  1. Focus on consumer confidence by looking at all of your products and services and reengineering them to be delivered in this new virtual environment.\n  2. Keep in constant communication with all constituents.\n  3. Develop different metrics of success for your teams (work happens when work happens). It\u2019s not about face-to-face.\n  4. Encourage all managers to think holistically about benefits because when we get on the other side of the pandemic (and we will), we will face a whole new set of people with different expectations about their relationship between the world and their work.\n\nThis will require a leap of faith. You\u2019ll need to make decisions based on non-\ntraditional information, and you\u2019ll need to be constantly updated to translate\nnext steps that make sense for your organization, even when the path forward\nis clouded with uncertainty and angst. When we get on the other side of this\nvirus, these changes will be seen as benefits\u2014forced into doing them now, but\nhelpful in setting the stage for future generations.\n\nScott Cawood is president and CEO at WorldatWork, a nonprofit professional\nassociation in compensation and total rewards.

However, it is crucial for\nemployees to understand that while their workplace environment may have\ntemporarily changed, their conduct is held to the same standard as when they\nare present in the office, including with respect to any online\ncommunications.\n\n**The new normal - an online workplace**\n\nWith organisations now actively encouraging employees to leverage the various\ninstant online communication platforms available to them, including Microsoft\nTeams, Zoom, Slack, and other instant messaging platforms, it is crucial that\nemployees understand their responsibility to communicate in the same way as\nthey would in the workplace itself, and comply with all applicable workplace\npolicies.\n\nThere is no doubt that instant messaging can be an effective communication\ntool - however, employers should be managing the risks associated with this\nplatform in the same way as every other IT, communications, and social media\nplatform. Employers need to be just as vigilant of inappropriate behaviour\nwhile employees are working from home, if not more so than they would if\nemployees were working in the office environment. Instant messaging gives the\nperception that conversations held, or content posted on these platforms is\n\"private\" or confidential between the recipients, regardless of their\nconnection to the workplace.\n\nThere is a real risk that employees forget or just don't think that\ncommunications over these platforms are subject to the employer's workplace\npolicies in the same way other forms of communication are. Communications over\nthese types of platforms can be ripe for allegations of bullying, harassment,\nincluding sexual harassment and discrimination. Think sexual harassment\nthrough memes, GIFs and other \"light-hearted\" jokes to break the solitude or\ninappropriate 'banter' in a chat group to break up the day.\n\n**Cyberbullying \"at work\"**\n\nOur current working from home landscape also exposes employees to increased\nrisk of being the subject of cyberbullying, with employees utilising online\ncommunication tools to expose other employees to negative and attacking online\nbehaviours by way of email, instant messaging and video conferencing\nplatforms.\n\nSuch bullying can also go unnoticed by colleagues and unchecked by\nHR/management. An employee is bullied at work if a person or group of people\nrepeatedly act unreasonably towards them, and this behaviour creates a risk to\nthe employee's health and safety. Confusion often arises around what is\nconsidered to be \"at work\", particularly in the age of remote working,\nflexibility and online communications at employees' fingers tips at all times.\nWhile the law is constantly evolving with respect to the concept of \"at work\",\nit is accepted that bullying does not necessarily have to occur at the actual\nworkplace, however, it must occur while the worker is actively engaged in the\nperformance of work or some other activity which is authorised or permitted by\nthe employer. This may include a lunch break onsite, a work trip outside of\nthe normal working area, accessing social media while onsite, and relevantly,\nwhen working from home.\n\nIt is important to remember that employers and individual employees can be\nliable, vicariously and personally, respectively, for inappropriate conduct\nthat occurs \"at work\", which crucially extends to the inappropriate conduct of\nemployees working from home. Employers also must remain cognisant of their\nobligations from a work health and safety perspective to ensure that people\nare not being subjected to bullying type conduct.  With the Australian\nworkforce largely working from home it may even be easier for employees to be\nbullied without that being known, seen or heard.\n\n**Workers Compensation Claims**\n\nEmployers should, of course, be currently taking steps to ensure that\nemployees are taking steps to set up home offices/workspaces to be safe to\navoid physical injuries, however, it is equally important to remember that\nemployees who have been the victims of unlawful treatment, including bullying\nbehaviours, adverse action, and harassment, are also able to bring workers\ncompensation claims for any psychological injuries sustained as a result,\nprovided they are able to establish that the injury was arising out of or in\nthe course of their employment.  This includes any psychological injuries\nsustained while working from home.\n\n**Strategies to reduce inappropriate behaviour while working from home**\n\nIn our experience, it is apparent that employees seem much more likely to be\ncasual and even inappropriate over instant messaging communications than in\nperson or via email. Given the heavily increased use of such communication\nmethods while employees are working from home, and in order to mitigate the\nrisks associated with employees engaging in inappropriate conduct while\nworking from home, it is recommended that your organisation consider the\nfollowing tips:\n\n  * Stay in touch! Maintaining regular contact with employees is now more important than ever, and HR and management functions should seek to ensure that they maintain regular contact with their employees.\n  * Remind employees of workplace policies in force, particularly Social Media and IT Usage policies, and where these policies can be accessed.\n  * Employees should be reminded that anything put in an instant message should be something that they would be willing to say to a colleague's face in person or via email.  If this is not the case, the communication is likely inappropriate.\n  * Remind employees that all communications over the organisation's IT systems, including all instant messages on chat programs such as Teams, are stored by the organisation and can be reviewed at a later date.\n  * If you have specific concerns about behaviours or a pattern of behaviours, be prompt in addressing these concerns.\n  * Ensure that you have a Workplace Surveillance Policy and/or employment contracts that provide sufficient notice to your employees that you may monitor any online communication made using the organisation's IT systems.\n  * Review your communications software to ensure data is retained and accessible to the organisation.  Be careful - it can be more difficult on some communication platforms than others to obtain message history.\n  * If your communications software allows for employees to record video calls, ensure all employees are aware of this feature and your organisation's policies regarding the recording of video calls and notification/consent of such.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that in times of uncertainty, culture is\ndriven from the top, with employees looking to management teams and executives\nfor direction. On this basis, it is important that HR and management teams are\nleading by example and ensuring all of their own behaviours and communications\nare appropriate, not only those communications which are widely disseminated\nbut also communications in individual and smaller team situations.\n\nThis is a time of great uncertainty and worry for employees, where\ncommunication is vital and any light relief is, generally, welcomed. While we\ncertainly don't want to be the fun police, it is important to remember that\nthere is often a fine line between the 'banter' and the unlawful act. With\nemployees now sitting behind cameras or at the end of phones and instant\nmessaging platforms, it's even more difficult to gauge colleagues' reactions\nand perceptions.

And what I mean by that it's\nan opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.\u2019-Rahm\nEmanuel**_\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis falls exactly into this bracket. Today, businesses the\nworld over are battling the impact of this global pandemic and the biggest\nquestions that stare them in the face are-how do they ensure business\ncontinuity in this time of crisis? According to a\n[survey](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/talent-management/impact-of-\ncovid-19-on-the-indian-economy-workforce-25114) by the Federation of Indian\nChambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI), the immediate impact of COVID-19\nreveals that besides the direct impact on demand and supply of goods and\nservices, businesses are also facing reduced cash flows due to slowing\neconomic activity which in turn is having an impact on all payments including\nto those for employees, interest, loan repayments, and taxes.\n\nA significant 53 percent of Indian businesses indicate the marked impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on business operations even at early stages. Moreover,\nthe pandemic has significantly impacted the cash flow at organizations with\nalmost 80 percent reporting a decrease in cash flow. Nearly 30 percent\norganizations have already put in place Work-from-Home policies for their\nemployees and about 42 percent of the respondents feel that it could take up\nto 3 months for normalcy to return.\n\nIn such a scenario, how can organizations continue to provide a seamless\nemployee experience to their employees despite the mandatory work from home\n(WFH) situation? Most importantly and urgently, how do they make sure expense\nmanagement is on track given the strain this crisis has put on resources and\ncapabilities. The crisis has affected even the most basic levels of an\norganization\u2019s operational functioning, laying bare the need to re-strategize\nthe building blocks of their employee experience strategy.\n\n_**Take for instance, the routine tasks of employees filing their travel and\nreimbursements. As per[Happay's](https://www.happay.in/) CFO Benchmark study,\n82% of respondents in the study stated that expense claims still had to be\nfiled manually by attaching bills to paper vouchers. Some of the businesses\nhave a semi-automated workflow where just the approvals can be taken\nonline.**_\n\nSo for businesses that have not yet automated expense management, a crisis\nsuch as this makes spend management a challenge, severely impacting the\nemployee experience of their employees in times of crisis. On account of the\nmandatory WFH situation as offices have shut down, employees can\u2019t submit\nexpenses physically nor can the transfer of expense documents can happen on\naccount of the social distancing and contactless sharing complications.\n\nJust like it is important to avoid physical handshakes, and close contact with\neach other, it is equally important to avoid the transfer of physical\ndocuments between employees to stop the viral infection from spreading within\nthe organization. One of the most frequently transferred documents is Expense\nvouchers/bills. Each of the physical vouchers moves hands from employee to\nmanager, and manager to finance, and in between by handlers/runners wherever\nrequired. So it transfers from 3 to 6 pairs of hands, for just one expense\nreport filed. Given the fact that the severe acute respiratory syndrome\ncoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is detectable for up to 24 hours on [cardboard(or\npaper)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973), the transfer of\ndocuments becomes a high risk.\n\nWhile some companies may have resorted to scanning & sending it from the\noffice scanner, but with WFH rapidly becoming the norm, finding scanners is a\nchallenge. And even if some employees are lucky enough to have a shop nearby\nthat provides a scanning service, it is still riskier for the employee to hand\nover the bills/vouchers, and get it back with possible contamination from the\npublic scanner. Also, many companies don\u2019t have a Mobile and cloud-ready spend\nmanagement platform with OCR capabilities for a quick snap and upload of\nbills. Now with social distancing and lockdowns in place, even contactless\nsharing is out of the purview of many employees.\n\n### Strategizing spend management in crisis\n\nThen again, the crisis itself has led to more expenses for employees arising\nout of the need for setting the operational infrastructure to work from home.\nNot all employees might have had a WFH operational structure ready beforehand\nand have had to invest in creating the extra bandwidth for it- be it in terms\nof Wi-Fi connections or virtual collaboration tools or the physical setup.\nThese are not budgeted expenses. Added to these are some ad hoc purchases of\ndisinfectant wipes, gloves, etc., which would also increase the Admin costs of\ncompanies categorized under essential services. Augmenting it further are the\nflight rescheduling & cancellations, last-minute flight bookings, hospital\nreimbursements, group insurance costs and hotel cancellations, which could\nmake a significant impact on any company's bottom line.\n\nThus, for companies, this means relooking at their employee benefits strategy\nin order to make sure digital transfer of benefits happens seamlessly while at\nthe same time they need to strategize expense management and ensure business\ncontinuity as working in a crisis mode becomes the new normal.\n\n> Varun Rathi, Co-founder & COO, Happay aptly says, \u201cIn such unprecedented\n> times, CXOs need a flexible and fully automated spend management platform to\n> keep a tight leash on Covid-19 spends before it spirals out of control. A\n> platform with decent mobile and analytics capabilities, with real-time\n> policy modification possibilities, should be preferred.\u201d\n\nThe crisis thus requires businesses to take a deep and hard look at\noperational expense management. Cost optimization strategies need to be the\nfocus area of HR leaders in order to drive efficiency, manage risk, maintain\nemployee productivity at the same levels as before the crisis, and deliver a\nsmooth and unbroken employee experience despite testing times.\n\n**What are some of the basic actions that can get you started?**\n\nAs per [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/hr-under-pressure-\nto-cut-costs-know-how-to-protect-whats-important/), the first one of them is\nconducting scenario planning to assess the current and future impact of\nCOVID-19 on your function in a structured way, applying reliable criteria.\nBased on likely scenarios, organizations need to define their response from a\ncost optimization perspective and accordingly plan and manage costs.\n\nDevelop a policy to heighten awareness among travelers of the costs they incur\nwhen changing business travel plans for personal reasons or on account of\npandemic cases. For all expenses and ticket cancellation credits related to\nCOVID-19 Cancelled Travel expense type, create an \u2018expense type\u2019 for proper\ntracking of Covid-19 Impact. This can work with both charges and credits and\ncan help in keeping track of canceled travel during this time. For any\nunbudgeted/emergency expenses (such as purchases of disinfectant wipes,\ngloves, etc), create a new expense type for better visibility.\n\n###  Protecting employee experience in times of crisis\n\nHowever, at the same time, there is a need to protect employee experience and\nproductivity during times of crisis. The responsibility of HR to drive talent\noutcomes, in fact, becomes even more critical during testing times.\nProductivity is directly impacted by employee experience and hence the need to\ndeliver a good employee experience even in bad times. Take the case of expense\nmanagement- a simple, intuitive expense management solution such as Happay can\nhelp you deliver the same superlative experience to your employees, be it good\nor bad times, enabling you to maintain similar levels of productivity as in\nnormal times.\n\nAfter all, as aptly stated by [HBR](https://hbr.org/2020/02/lead-your-\nbusiness-through-the-coronavirus-crisis), a crisis doesn\u2019t imply immunity from\nperformance management, and sooner or later markets will judge which companies\nmanaged the challenge most effectively. Nor is the Covid-19 crisis the last of\nthe global crises to hit businesses. HBR\u2019s research on the effectiveness of\norganizational responses to dynamic crises indicates that there is one\nvariable that is most predictive of eventual success \u2013 preparation and\npreemption. And preparing for the next crisis now is likely to be much more\neffective than an ad hoc, reactive response when the crisis actually hits.\n\nThis is why, it is now that there is a dire need for businesses to relook at\ntheir expense management, benefits transfer, and employee experience\nstrategies during a crisis situation. It is now that they need to re-\nstrategize their employee benefits strategy and question whether they are in a\nposition to ensure seamless operational expense management in times of crisis.\nIt will be a changed world after Covid-19 and remote work is going to become\nan even bigger feature of our lives post the crisis. Hence now is the time to\nrelook and reflect and build resilience in your systems and processes and to\nformulate your strategy on business continuity and expense management for the\nfuture world of work\n\n_**Join us for an exclusive webcast in association with Happay on \u2018Decoding\nbusiness continuity and expense management in times of crisis\u2019 on 7th\nApril.[Click here](https://www.peoplematters.in/webcast/watch-decoding-\nbusiness-continuity-and-expense-management-in-times-of-crisis) to register.**_\n\n**_References:-_**\n\n[_https://hbr.org/2020/02/lead-your-business-through-the-coronavirus-\ncrisis_](https://hbr.org/2020/02/lead-your-business-through-the-coronavirus-\ncrisis)\n\n[_https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/hr-under-pressure-to-cut-costs-\nknow-how-to-protect-whats-\nimportant/_](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/hr-under-pressure-to-\ncut-costs-know-how-to-protect-whats-important/)\n\n[_Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1\nStudy published in The New England Journal of\nMedicine_](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973)\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Compensation & Benefits](/category/compensation-\nperformance/compensation-\nbenefits?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=compensation-benefits \"Browse\nmore in: Compensation &amp; Benefits\"), [Employee\nEngagement](/category/compensation-performance/employee-\nengagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=employee-engagement \"Browse\nmore in: Employee Engagement\"),\n[#COVID-19](/tag/covid-19?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=covid-19 \"Browse\nmore in: COVID-19\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Shweta Modgil](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1524982217/authors/shweta-\nmodgil.jpg)](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\n#### [Shweta Modgil](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\nShweta is working as a Senior Features Writer with People Matters.

[Stuart Rudner, founder of Rudner\nLaw](https://www.hrreporter.com/external-contributors/stuart-rudner) in\nToronto, is here to answer some top-of-mind questions.\n\n**Q: Can we temporarily lay off employees until business improves?**\n\n**A:** \"It's hard because this is obviously an unprecedented situation. But\nalthough some laws have been amended, the fundamental law hasn't changed. And\nthis comes as a shock to a lot of people but employers don't automatically\nhave the right to [temporarily] lay people off.\n\nThere's always an assumption that if things slow down, if you don't have much\nwork, you can just send people home for a little while. And that may be true\nin certain industries in the construction industry, for example, it's pretty\nmuch a given that [because of] the seasonal work, things slow down, and you\nlay people off temporarily. But aside from that, unless there's either an\nexplicit agreement in the contract or it's implied by the nature of the of the\nworkplace or industry, then you don't have that right.\n\nAnd if you do lay somebody off [temporarily], then that would be a\nconstructive dismissal and you're on the hook for severance all of a sudden.\"\n\n**Q: What 's involved with a temporary layoff?**\n\n**A:** \"Assuming that you do have the right or that the employee agrees, then\nemployment standards legislation sets out what the parameters are. So, for\nexample, in Ontario, you can temporarily lay someone off for up to 13 weeks,\nwhich can be extended up to 35 weeks in some circumstances. Once you go past\nthat, it becomes a termination.\n\nI've had clients go and ask their employees to agree to temporary layoffs;\nI've had clients ask their employees to agree to reductions in hours of work,\nand in some cases reductions in pay. And it goes over a lot better if you can\ntell your staff that the management and owners are taking a hit as well.\n\nPeople should not make any assumptions about how the law works. So, don't\nassume you can lay people off; don't assume you can just change their hours.\nMake sure to get proper legal advice because the worst thing to do as an\nemployer is to try to cut costs by laying somebody off [temporarily] and\ninadvertently exposing yourself to a wrongful dismissal claim.\"\n\n**Q: What if an employee doesn 't agree to a temporary layoff?**\n\n**A:** \"There are two scenarios. The first one is where there is a contract in\nplace that allows the employer to temporarily lay off the employee, in which\ncase they can imply proceed to do so in accordance with the parameters set out\nin employment standards legislation.\n\nThe second scenario is where there is no contractual or implied right to lay\npeople off temporarily, in which case most of them are going to their staff --\nand we're encouraging them -- to have very frank discussions and explaining\nthat \"Given the unprecedented circumstance we're in, everyone's going to need\nto pitch in\" and ask them essentially to agree to a temporary layoff. And if\nthe employee agrees, then of course they're [OK] to do it.\n\nIf they don't agree, then an employer has really got two choices. You can\neither keep things as is and continue to employ them or lay them off or reduce\ntheir hours, and take a risk that they'll bring a constructive dismissal claim\nagainst you. At some point, it's a weighing of risks.\"\n\n**Q: Could this situation be considered a frustration of contract?**\n\n**A:** \"The fundamental definition of a frustration of contract is an\nunanticipated event, not caused by any party, that makes it impossible to\ncomplete the contract. So, the classic example is if you agree to rent a condo\nand the building burns down before you move in, then it's impossible to\ncomplete the contract. This would be analogous to that.\n\nAnd I could certainly see the argument being made that this was entirely\nunanticipated, and it's certainly not the fault of either party. And because\nof changing circumstances, it's not possible to complete the contract,\ntherefore, the contract has been frustrated. I think we're going to see that\nargument being made, at least until the government's closes that loophole,\nwhich they could.\n\nIt's arguable and it will definitely have to be assessed on a case-by-case\nbasis. The strongest argument for frustration would be where there has been a\ngovernment order that the business shut down. If that's the case, then I think\nit's a strong argument for frustration; if it's a matter of an employer just\nchoosing to shut down under the circumstances, I think it may be harder for\nthem to claim frustration.\"\n\n**Q: What happens if there is a frustration of contract?**\n\n**A:** \"That means that there's a termination of the employment agreement, but\nthere's no obligation to provide severance or anything else, aside from\nstatutory obligations. The contract just basically comes to an end. It might\nmake some employers' lives easier but it's a harsh result for employees to be\ntold that your employment is ending and you're not owed any compensation.\"\n\n**Q: Can employers offer additional compensation?**\n\n**A:** \"A lot of our clients have been really great about trying to help their\nstaff by trying to cushion any economic blow. And, conversely, I think a lot\nof employees at this point are being very cooperative and everyone is looking\nat this as something that we're all in together.\n\nSome employers are offering to top up the employment insurance benefits, which\nis permissible in certain circumstances. They are also allowing employees to\naccess sick days and vacation time, even borrowing ahead if none has accrued.\n\nEveryone is trying to be creative. So, employers might say, \"We'll pay you\nuntil the end of March and then we'll have to reassess at that time.\" Or,\nobviously, if you're sending people home, it could be a paid leave. But most\nemployers can't afford to do that for very long.

Reduce your business\u2019 risk with these 4\nbest practices.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * [Facebook](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/feature_article/heightened-epl-exposure-hits-cannabis-businesses-when-laying-off-employees/?share=facebook \"Click to share on Facebook\")\n  * [LinkedIn](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/feature_article/heightened-epl-exposure-hits-cannabis-businesses-when-laying-off-employees/?share=linkedin \"Click to share on LinkedIn\")\n  * [Twitter](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/feature_article/heightened-epl-exposure-hits-cannabis-businesses-when-laying-off-employees/?share=twitter \"Click to share on Twitter\")\n  * [Google](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/feature_article/heightened-epl-exposure-hits-cannabis-businesses-when-laying-off-employees/?share=google-plus-1 \"Click to share on Google+\")\n  * [Email](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/feature_article/heightened-epl-exposure-hits-cannabis-businesses-when-laying-off-employees/?share=email \"Click to email this to a friend\")\n  * \n\nEven though it\u2019s valued at more than $15 billion, the burgeoning global\ncannabis industry has experienced recent layoffs. By the end of 2019, more\nthan 600 cannabis employees got pink slips. Industry experts expect more of\nthe same in 2020 as investigations, lawsuits and slumping valuations plague\nthe industry.\n\nUnfortunately for employers, layoffs are where the issues begin - not end.\nEspecially for those without established policies and procedures. Without\nrules and regulations governing employment practices, business owners and\noperators are at considerable risk.\n\nThe 11 states where cannabis is legal for recreational use and the 33 where\nit\u2019s medically legal tend to have more onerous employment practices liability\n(EPL) laws, where liability is often assumed by the employer for mistakes like\npoorly handled layoffs. This is further compounded by the fact that HR\ndepartments at fledgling cannabis companies tend to be small or non-existent\nand often ill prepared to deal with the legalities that come with termination.\n\nEnsuring the right practices are in place prior to any layoffs is critical. Is\nyour company facing employee terminations? Are you knowledgeable of how to\nhandle it? Consider the following best practices:\n\n  1. **Document problematic employees.** Create a folder for each employee and document the details when problematic situations escalate to the point they need to be addressed. Should employees of a protected class engage in an EEOC, class action or personal lawsuit after they\u2019re terminated, you\u2019ll need this documentation to support your actions.\n  2. **Create a formal termination procedure.** Make sure the procedure includes well-thought-out details of your review process, including how employee performance is evaluated and what happens when those standards aren\u2019t met. Spell out which behaviors are grounds for dismissal. When talking to the employee about a termination, have another employee or manager in the room to avoid claims of mishandling later on, typically their direct manager, someone from HR or your in-house attorney. Determine how the distribution of final compensation such as medical insurance or PTO will be handled so you\u2019re prepared to answer those questions. These procedures should be spelled out in an employee handbook given to all at onboarding so there are no surprises.\n  3. **Retain a qualified EPL attorney.** Create a relationship with a qualified EPL attorney (not your cousin who does divorce law) to help you set policies and procedures initially and to consult with when a unique or particularly difficult situation arises.\n  4. **Get the right EPL coverage.** An EPL policy will defend a business from claims of breach of employment contraction, negligent evaluation, failure to employ or promote, wrongful termination, deprivation of career opportunity and mismanagement of employee benefits plans. Your EPL coverage will be determined by your location, clientele, employee profile and what you see as your biggest risks. When discussing the policy with your broker, weigh the following considerations to EPL coverage: \n    * Reimbursement coverage versus pay on behalf. Should the policy pay your defense costs directly, or will you lay out the money and they\u2019ll reimburse?\n    * The definition of a claim and wrongful act will be different for each EPL policy.\n    * EPL policy\u2019s limit structure. Do you want defense limits to be outside or inside the coverage?\n\nHaving to lay off employees is never an easy choice for an employer. Make sure\nyou and your business do everything right before and during the process so\nthat the aftermath isn\u2019t even more difficult, filled with lawsuits and\nliability claims.\n\n### Share

The major concern is that it may also eventually lead to\nmassive job cuts to lessen the financial burden. Praveen Khandelwal,\nSecretary-General of CAIT shared with ET, \u201cWe have asked the government to\nprovide support on the salary component to the tune of 50 percent. Rest 25\npercent will be taken care of by the employer and another 25 percent by the\nemployee.\u201d\n\nWith the business shut down because of the lockdown, retailers are now\nconcerned about managing costs. \"Once the situation normalises, the traders\nwill have multiple challenges such as commercial rent, statutory payment and\nbusiness revival which would further make the traders financial condition\nworse,\" Khandelwal added.\n\nIn the letter addressed to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and dated April\n2, CAIT has mentioned that a strong stimulus package is needed for the small\nbusinesses who are the contributors of a major chunk of revenue to the\ngovernment and are also the backbone of the Indian economy.\n\nIn recent years, small businesses were indeed given a lot of focus and\nidentified as a source of creating more job opportunities as well. However,\nthe current crisis looming over the country due to COVID-19 has put all of\nthese jobs in question now.

As companies fight for talent, a critical change in the\nstrategy could ultimately seal the deal for high-performing talent courted by\ncompany recruiters.\n\nEmployees today are more likely to move to another company with better\nofferings.  Not only that, but it's easier than ever for employees to research\nthis information.  Workers are regularly sharing just about every piece of\ninformation they can online.  That includes compensation and benefits\ninformation.  With that data, employees can evaluate employers based on what\nthey've found.\n\nBut the compensation and benefits strategy goes beyond the War for Talent.  In\nfact, it's something that has to be considered for every employee.  Sometimes,\nit's a one-size-fits-all approach and sometimes it's more individualistic.\nEither way, it's important human resources keeps a handle on the strategy.\n\n# Compensation and Benefits\n\n## Best Practices\n\n  1. **Understand the budget**\n\nHR needs to make sure they understand how the company budget is structured\nwhen it comes to compensation and benefits.  Why is this important?  HR needs\nto understand how the money is going to be spent.  Keeping compensation and\nbenefits balanced is critical to making sure HR can continue to adapt the\nstrategy accordingly.\n\n  2. **Consistently review employee compensation**\n\nMost HR departments only look at the compensation of employees at the end of\nthe year or during an employee review period.  This helps determine salaries\ngoing forward.  However, reviewing compensation practices at least quarterly\nallows HR to make adjustments as needed.  Understand, that doesn't mean the\nadjustments happen that often, but it does make it easier.\n\n  3. **Create salary ranges**\n\nThis aligns with the previous practice.  It also helps ensure the organization\nis competitive in the industry.  These can be developed by [benchmarking\nsimilar jobs or based on internal\npractices](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-compensation-benefits/news/hr-\nnews-beat-walmart-salaries-revealed).\n\n  4. **Audits are a must**\n\nAdditionally, HR should audit compensation on a regular basis.  There are any\nnumber of changes that could impact salaries and the need to adjust those for\nemployees.\n\n  5. **Pay high performing employees well**\n\nHigher performance should mean higher pay.  This is an important piece of not\nonly compensation and benefits, but also retention.  Employees who don't feel\nthey are paid what they are worth will going looking for a company that aligns\nwith this belief.\n\n> WEBINAR:  [Cultivating a Culture-Based R&R Program through\n> Technology](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-compensation-\n> benefits/webinars/cultivating-a-culture-based-rr-program-through-technology)\n\n  6. **Benefits as part of the strategy**\n\nIn addition to retention, benefits also help attract new employees.  The goal\nhere is to be competitive and the preferred employer in the industry.  Often\ntimes, benefits are a deciding factor for a potential new employee.\n\n  7. **Develop a plan**\n\nThe plan developed is the compiling of all the previous practices into one\nstrategy.  Understanding how the HR department is going to apply these\npractices throughout the year will help ensure success at the end of each\nprocess.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nA compensation and benefits strategy remains in a fluid state.  It's not meant\nto be rigid.  A stiff and stale process can lead to immeasurable loss as the\ncompany tries to attract and retain the best workers for the organization.\nWith a fluid approach, the compensation and benefits strategy can increase the\norganization's competitiveness and help find the best talent available.\nCompanies with a strong sense of the compensation and benefits strategy will\nbe able hire the right people more often than not and will see great business\nsuccess.\n\n> NEXT:  [Salary Discussion Not Taboo](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-\n> compensation-benefits/news/hr-news-beat-salary-discussion-not-taboo)\n\n\n\n**_Want more content faster?

This historic\nfinancial stimulus package is designed to help,\u201d said Martin Mucci,\n[Paychex](https://www.paychex.com/) president, and CEO. \u201cWhile the passage of\nthe CARES Act is certainly a significant step, the next piece will be ensuring\nthis money quickly gets to those who need it most. National payroll providers\nsuch as Paychex are uniquely positioned to help with this, using existing\nbanking relationships and our service connection and experience with our\nclients.\u201d\n\n**HR News:**[BenefitEd to Improve Employee Experience with Nontaxable Loan\nRepayment Programs](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/compensation-\nbenefits/benefited-to-improve-employee-experience-with-nontaxable-loan-\nrepayment-programs/)\n\nThe CARES Act provides a comprehensive package including measures and\nappropriations aimed at providing financial relief to individuals, families,\nand businesses. The law, following the Families First Coronavirus Response Act\nand the Small Business Administration\u2019s Economic Industry Disaster Loan\nProgram, is the third relief package offered by Congress to assist businesses\nand individuals in navigating the economic hardships caused by the pandemic.\n\n## **Below is an overview of key elements:**\n\n### **Provisions for Businesses**\n\n  * **Small Business Loans:** Generally, businesses with 500 employees or fewer are eligible for Small Business Administration (SBA) emergency grants and the forgivable loan program. \n    * Through the Paycheck Protection Program, the SBA will be providing loans up to $10 million to qualified and eligible small businesses for up to 2.5 times the borrower\u2019s average monthly payroll costs to assist in covering certain expenses, including payroll. The loans may be forgiven under the conditions set forth.\n    * Qualified small businesses that apply for a loan under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program due to COVID-19 will be eligible for SBA emergency grants of up to $10,000 to provide immediate relief for covered costs, including payroll, making rent or mortgage payments, and repaying obligations that cannot be met due to revenue losses.\n    * Small business development centers and women's business centers may be receiving grants to assist in educating, training, and advising small businesses on various items such as accessing and applying for resources provided by the SBA.\n\n  * **Delay of Payment of Employer Payroll Taxes:** The bill allows some employers to defer payment of the employer share of the Social Security tax. \n    * All employers are responsible for paying the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax on employee wages.\n    * Deferred employment tax must be paid over the following two years, with half of the amount required to be paid by December 31, 2021, and the other half by December 31, 2022.\n\n  * **Employee Retention Credit:** Some employers may be eligible to obtain a payroll tax credit for retaining employees during the pandemic. \n    * Eligible employers will be able to claim 50 percent of qualified wages paid up to $10,000 per employee.\n    * Several rules were established to determine eligibility for the credit. Businesses must be impacted by forced closures or quarantines and have seen a 50 percent drop or more in revenues in order to qualify.\n    * A business would not be eligible to take both this credit and a forgivable small business administration loan. \n    * It is expected that the Treasury Department will be advancing this credit in order to provide the funds back to employers more quickly.\n\n### **Provisions for Individuals**\n\n  * **Recovery Rebates for Individuals:** This provision allows for direct payments to individuals in two waves. \n    * Payments of $1,200 will be issued, with an additional $500 added for each dependent child, under age 17.\n    * These payments are based on the 2019 tax return filed, or the 2018 return if 2019 has not yet been filed.\n    * The payments are based on individuals whose adjusted gross income was $75,000 or less ($150,000 for married filing jointly, $112,500 for the head of household).\n    * People with an adjusted gross income (AGI) over $75,000 ($150,000 for married filing jointly) will have their rebate reduced by $5 for $100 over the threshold. Once AGI reaches $99,000 ($198,000 married filing jointly, $146,500 head of household), the rebate will no longer be applicable.  \n\n  * **Unemployment Insurance Expansion:** Federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance in the amount of $600 per week may be provided to qualifying covered individuals, in addition to any benefits currently offered by their state, as outlined in the Act. \n    * Although benefits will vary by state, the expanded assistance provides an additional 13 weeks of unemployment benefits through December 31, 2020, for covered workers who remain unemployed after the weeks of state unemployment compensation expire. \n    * Expanded unemployment compensation now includes those not traditionally eligible for those benefits under state or federal law such as self-employed individuals, independent contractors, those with limited work history, etc., who are unable to work as a direct result of a COVID-19 health emergency. \n    * Funding is provided to pay the first-week cost of unemployment benefits through December 31, 2020, for states that choose to pay recipients immediately upon becoming unemployed in lieu of the one-week waiting period before the individual becomes eligible for compensation benefits.\n    * Temporary financing to support \u201cshort-time compensation\u201d (STC) programs will be provided for employers who opt to reduce employee hours rather than lay off workers. Employees with reduced hours will receive pro-rated unemployment benefits. The provision will pay 100 percent of the incurred costs to provide STC through December 31, 2020.  \n\n  * **Retirement Plan / S125 / HSA Relief:** The plan provides tax relief to retirement plan participants impacted by COVID-19. The main provisions include: \n    * Allow in-service distributions to COVID-19 qualifying participants\n    * Remove early withdrawal penalty for COVID-19 related distributions\n    * Increase in loans available amount to COVID-19 qualifying participants\n    * Delay in loan repayments for COVID-19 participants with outstanding loans\n    * The permit repayment period for COVID-19 related distributions\n    * Suspend the tax penalty on Required Minimum Distribution (RMDs) for retirement accounts for the calendar year 2020\n\n###  \n**How Paychex Can Help**\n\nWith a team of dedicated compliance experts,\n[Paychex](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/payroll-administration/paychex-\nintroduces-updates-and-new-solutions-for-hr-and-payroll/) is helping business\nowners and HR managers understand and implement the many provisions of the\nCARES Act.\n\nAs always, Paychex clients have full access to its suite of mobile and desktop\napplications, providing convenient online accessibility for HR needs, plus\nself-service tools that allow workers 24/7 access to critical payroll and HR\nfunctions.\n\nIn addition, Paychex is providing its 670,000 clients with access to a variety\nof services and solutions that are supporting them through the COVID-19\ncrisis, including:\n\n  * Compliance support to help businesses manage provisions of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and CARES Act, including paid leave tracking and facilitation of 401(k) loans and withdrawals. \n  * Expert HR guidance that helps businesses evaluate risks, adjust workplace policies and communicate HR and payroll changes to employees. \n  * Solutions to help businesses and workers manage cash flow and get more immediate access to earned wages, including Pay-On-Demand and more.\n  * Online HR tools that assist with the transition to remote work through learning and communications tools, document management, and more. \n\n  \nPaychex is also committed to protecting the health and safety of its employees\nwhile continuing to support its clients through this challenging time.

Sharma\nKalra](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/aditis/ \"Posts by Aditi\nSharma Kalra\")\n\n## Compensation & benefits: Best practices for 2019\n\nHuman Resources magazine and the HR Bulletin daily email newsletter:  \nAsia's only regional HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\nIt has been said many times, but perhaps not enough - what you choose in your\ntotal rewards package should reflect your values as a company, or you may see\nemployees finding that alignment elsewhere.\n\nNot only are employees today empowered to make moves, it\u2019s easier than ever\nfor them to research and evaluate employers. They are sharing every aspect of\ntheir work experience online \u2014 including compensation, benefits packages,\ncompany outlook, their opinions of leadership and more.\n\nSo what are some of the hot topics in compensation & benefits that you and\nyour team could look out for? We've put together a few trends on Payscale's\nreport, [_Will They Stay or Will They Go?_](https://www.payscale.com/cbpr)\nbelow.\n\n_Note: These practices are derived from 'top-performing organisations' (TPOs),\ndefined as those that are number one in their industry and who exceeded their\nrevenue goals in 2018. _\n\n### 1\\. Make pay a year-round conversation\n\nTop-performing organisations think about pay all through the year rather than\nan annual event. More than half (58%) of TPOs have completed a market study\nwithin the past year, while just over a third (34%) give bonuses or incentives\nat least quarterly.\n\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean they adjust their ranges more often than typical\norganisations: many top-performing organisations adjust ranges annually (68%\nshifted ranges within the past year vs. 58% of typical organisations).\n\n### 2\\. Pay more for competitive jobs as well as for high-performers\n\nTop-performing organisations are more likely to let the data drive higher pay\nfor competitive jobs (58% vs. 51% of typical organisations).\n\nAlso, TPOs tend to reward high-performers through bigger base pay increases\n(64%), promotions (54%), and career development (38%).\n\n### 3\\. Train managers to deal with pay issues\n\nTop-performing organisations get a pulse on employee engagement a bit more\nfrequently, with one in five citing the use of ongoing or real-time surveys to\nmeasure employee engagement. a majority (59%) also offer learning and\ndevelopment to recruit and retain high-performers.\n\nMost of all, when it comes to 'compversations', TPOs are somewhat confident\n(47%) or very confident (17%) in their manager\u2019s ability to have tough comp\nconversations about pay. More than one-third (35%) offer manager training to\nteach managers how to talk to employees about compensation.\n\n* * *\n\n### Bonus tip: Make salaries transparent to reduce the gender pay gap\n\nAlthough this is not cited in the PayScale report, we [found research that\nsuggests](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/research-make-salaries-\ntransparent-to-reduce-the-gender-pay-gap/) pay transparency has a positive\nimpact on closing the wage gap.\n\nThe working paper noted that following the introduction of Denmark\u2019s 2006 Act\non Gender Specific Pay Statistics \u2013 which obligates companies with more than\n35 employees to report on gender pay gaps \u2013 a 7% reduction in the gender pay\ngap was found.\n\nThe researchers found that before the regulation was introduced, the firms\nanalysed paid their male employees a 18.9% wage premium. After the regulation,\nthe researchers noted the gender pay gap had shrunk to 17.6% in the\napproximately 1,000 Danish firms governed by the new 2006 legislation.\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

While the\nfirst confirmed case of COVID-19 in India was reported on 30 January 2020, it\nwas not until March 2020 that the public and government began taking\ncognizance of it. The number of confirmed cases in India has crossed 900 as of\n28 March 2020, and State Governments have resorted to stringent measures to\ncontrol the outbreak and promote maximum social distancing.\n\nSeveral questions come up in this backdrop and remain unanswered on the\nbusiness and employment front. In this guide, the Employment Labour and\nBenefits team at Khaitan & Co attempts to address the frequently asked\nquestions in the current circumstances from an employment law and practice\nstandpoint.\n\n### SECTION I: EMPLOYER'S OBLIGATIONS AND GENERAL MEASURES FOR WORKPLACE\nMANAGEMENT\n\n### Part A - Managing suspect cases\n\n**Who is a suspect case?**  \n---  \n  \nEmployers may refer to the guidelines issued by\n[WHO](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/global-surveillance-for-human-\ninfection-with-novel-coronavirus-\\(2019-ncov\\)) and [National Centre for\nDisease\nControl](https://ncdc.gov.in/WriteReadData/l892s/96997299691580715786.pdf)\n(India) to determine whether an employee may be considered as a 'suspect\ncase'.\n\n**Can an employer mandate medical examination of employees?**  \n---  \n  \nWhile there are no statutory provisions requiring the employer to direct\nemployees to get medical examination done for COVID-19, the employers may, as\na measure to ensure the health and safety of employees, suggest the employee\nto get himself / herself medically tested for COVID-19.\n\n**Can the employer perform non-invasive screening checks on employees /\nvisitors?**  \n---  \n  \nPresently there are no legal provisions in this regard. However, it is\nadvisable, that the employers provide advance notification to all employees,\ncontract workers and visitors about the non-invasive screening measures like\ntemperature checks that will be conducted on them. Such notification /\nintimation should clearly mention that the purpose of performing such\nscreening is only during the current extraordinary situation occasioned by the\nCOVID-19 outbreak.\n\nEmployers should ensure that screening measures are non-invasive and are\nundertaken as a precautionary measure to safeguard health and safety of\nemployees amidst the outbreak.\n\n**Does the employer have an obligation to report a suspect case to the health\nauthorities?**  \n---  \n  \nCurrently, there are no notifications / orders issued by the government\nmandatorily requiring the employers to notify suspect COVID-19 cases amongst\ntheir employees. However, employers should, in good faith, report such cases\nto competent health authorities. The employer may consider giving prior\nintimation to the employee about such reporting.\n\n### Part B: Managing confirmed cases\n\n**Does the employee have an obligation to report the occurrence of the\ninfection to the employer?**  \n---  \n  \nCurrently, there are no notifications / orders issued by the government\nmandating employees to report the occurrence of COVID-19 to their employers.\nHowever, if the employment contract / company policy sets out clause relating\nto disclosure of any disease / illness, the employees should report COVID-19\noccurrence or symptoms to the employer. In the absence of an express\nstipulation, the employer may encourage and notify the employees to report any\nsuch incidence, as a measure to ensure safety of other employees to contain\nthe outbreak.\n\n**Can an employer publicly disclose the identity of an employee who has\ncontracted COVID-19?**  \n---  \n  \nAny information on medical history / physical health of an individual falls\nwithin the definitional attributes of 'sensitive personal data' under the\nInformation Technology Act 2000 and hence should not be disclosed without\nwritten consent of the concerned individual.\n\nHowever, if the consent is refused, the employer should let the relevant\nauthority take the necessary steps for contact tracing. Having said that, to\nensure the health and safety of other employees, employers should warn the\nother employees / stakeholders who may have come in contact with the infected\nemployee without disclosing the identity of such employee.\n\n**If an infected employee has exhausted his sick leaves and requests for\nadditional leaves, can the employer refuse to grant the same?**  \n---  \n  \nGiven the general duty of the employer to ensure health and safety of\nemployees at workplace, it is important that the employers adopt sympathetic\napproach and grant additional leaves. Please note that the Karnataka Labour\nDepartment has issued a specific notification requiring employers to grant 28\ndays of paid sick to employees who have tested positive for COVID-19.\nCurrently there are no such orders / notifications from other state\ngovernments, it is important that employers adopt sympathetic approach and\ngrant additional leaves.\n\nConsidering the situation right now, the governments of Maharashtra,\nTelangana, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Delhi and Gujarat have come out with\ncirculars / advisory asking the employers not to terminate the employee's\nemployment or reduce their wages during the lockdown period or quarantine\nperiod for symptomatic employees. The Government of India, too, has released a\nsimilar advisory for public and private employers. We expect other states to\nfollow this advisory.\n\n**Can an employee raise claims of unfair labour practice if his / her services\nhave been terminated due to the infection?**  \n---  \n  \nIf an employee's services have been terminated after he remained ill for a\nprolonged period, the claim, if raised, may not be sustainable since the\nIndustrial Disputes Act 1947 allows termination of services on the ground of\ncontinued ill-health. However, any such action on the employer's part should\nbe determined on the basis of medical opinion, if possible.\n\nHaving said that, it is important that employers adopt a sympathetic approach\ntowards infected employees and any arbitrary action simply by virtue of an\nemployee being treated against an employee under the treatment for the\ninfection for 28 days, must be avoided.\n\n**How soon should an employee who has been infected and recovered be allowed\nto the office again?**  \n---  \n  \nAs soon as the competent medical authorities have cleared the concerned\nemployee i.e. two specimens turn negative within a period of 24 hours, the\nconcerned employee may be allowed to join office again.\n\n### Part C - Miscellaneous\n\n**Can a company defer / cancel the employment of new joinees (who have not yet\njoined the services), in view of the outbreak and the local restrictions on\noperations?**  \n---  \n  \nCompanies should review the terms of the appointment letters issued to new\njoinees. In general, if the appointment letter stipulates a specific date on\nwhich the employee is required to report to work, the same should be\nconsidered as the effective date of commencement of employment relationship,\nunless there is any other stipulation indicating the contrary. The company\nmay, in such case, either delay the joining or revoke the offer of employment\nprior to the specified date of joining. Ultimately, it must be determined on a\ncase-to-case basis as to when the employment relationship would really\ncommence and whether the company has any flexibility to either delay the\njoining or revoke the offer at any time prior to such commencement.\n\n**What measures should be taken by the employer to prevent the risk of\ncontagion at the workplace?**  \n---  \n  \nEmployers may take the following precautions to prevent the risk of contagion\nat workplace:\n\n  * cancel all business / work trips to the affected regions (please refer to the [travel advisories](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/) issued by the Government of India thus far);\n  * educate employees / stakeholders on basic hygiene and the manner of reporting any suspected case to the employer / public health authorities;\n  * encourage self-reporting and self-quarantine;\n  * frequently communicate regulatory updates / official guidelines developments to employees (WHO, Ministry of Health and Welfare, state level guidelines / regulations);\n  * appoint health and safety offices and train managers / H&S; officers / HR personnel on spotting symptoms, emergency response protocol and containment measures.\n  * put in place a dedicated hotline and helpdesks for employees especially those working from home;\n  * provide a flexible working environment that takes social distancing into account;\n  * provide for a leave policy with additional sick / medical leaves, wherever necessary;\n  * put in place an anti-discrimination policy to ensure that employees who are required to go on sick leave / affected employees do not feel discriminated against;\n  * encourage working from home, wherever feasible and as advised by the state / local governments.\n\n**What should be done if an employee refuses to report to work because of the\nrisk of contagion?**  \n---  \n  \nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and various state governments have\nissued advisory / circulars encouraging employers of private organizations to\nallow employees to work from home, minimize use of public transportation,\nmaintain social distancing. In light of the aforesaid, employers should make\nthe necessary arrangement to ensure that the employees are able to work from\nhome.\n\nSince the situation is evolving and the entire country is under lockdown, the\nemployer will be required to act as per the central / state / local government\nadvisory.\n\nOnce the lockdown orders are lifted and offices can function again, employers\nshould ensure that workplaces are adequately sanitized and managed as\nprescribed by the regulatory advisories to avoid any risk of contagion to the\nworkforce returning for work.\n\n### SECTION II: WORK FROM HOME\n\n**What preparedness should an employer undertake to facilitate work from home\nfor employees?**  \n---  \n  \nThe employers could adopt the following measures to facilitate work from home\nfor its employees:\n\n  * ensure effective communication amongst employees (including team managers/supervisors), to prevent disruption in business operations;\n  * ensure employees are aware and adhere to the confidentiality obligation (as per the terms of their respective employment contract and/or handbook);\n  * employees should be provided proper IT equipment such as laptop / internet / webcam, etc. to be able to effectively work from home;\n  * if an employee is required to carry certain information/documents, it should be provided in encrypted format;\n  * company should ensure that effective IT tools / apps such as VPN, skype, cloud storage, IM, file sharing, virtual collaboration, etc. that are needed to support work from home are in place;\n  * company should ensure that employees are aware and have been trained to use IT tools / apps;\n  * employers should intimate the employees about the temporariness of work from home, tentative duration and their expectations while working from home;\n  * employers should have a dedicated remote working facility that allows employees to record the hours worked on a particular project on daily basis leading to effective monitoring of employees' working hours;\n  * ensure work from home is not implemented on a case to case basis, resulting in discrimination of employees;\n  * since, IT support is crucial in a work from home scenario, adequate support personnel may be designated by the establishment in staggered timings, to address any technical glitches;\n  * employers should ensure that the contact information of all employees and relevant stakeholders are readily available.\n\n**Whether an employer is mandatorily required to allow employees to work from\nhome?**  \n---  \n  \nExcept where an establishment is subject to a lockdown requirement, under a\nlocal administration order, an employer may continue its operations.\n\nIn order to curb the COVID-19 out-break, several state governments have\nemphasized on social distancing and advised employers to allow employees to\nwork from home. Few advisories issued by the respective state governments also\nstipulate that only 'essential staff/ workers' in staggered shifts should be\nengaged in the establishment.\n\n**Whether an employer can take disciplinary action if an employee is not\nperforming his/her assigned duties, while working from home?**  \n---  \n  \nYes, an employer can act against an employee in accordance with established\nprocedures, if the employee is found lacking in performance of assigned\nduties. However, such disciplinary action should not be in violation of\napplicable laws and principles of natural justice, and due consideration\nshould be accorded to the current lockdown situation and limitations for\nemployees to perform their assigned tasks from home, such as unavailability of\nadequate IT resources or connectivity issues.\n\n**Any insights for establishments where work from home is unviable.**  \n---  \n  \nGiven the nature of activities involved, work from home is not a feasible\noption for establishments engaged in manufacturing facilities. In this regard,\nunless there is a prohibition order (mandating lock down), such establishment\ncan operate at reduced capacity by engaging less workers in each shift,\nhowever, such establishments should ensure that workplaces are adequately\nsanitized, with safe distance between workers in accordance with prescribed\nhealthcare advisory (at least one meter) to prevent the contagion from\nspreading.\n\n### CHAPTER III: HANDLING CLOSURES / SHUTDOWNS\n\n**Is the employer required to shut down its operations on account of\nCOVID-19?**  \n---  \n  \nOn 22 March 2020, most states and union territories announced lockdown of\nshops and commercial establishments in their respective jurisdictions, subject\nto the exception of 'essential services' specified in the relevant lockdown\norders. These orders are operative till 31 March 2020.\n\nThereafter, on 24 March 2020, the Indian Prime Minister announced a complete\nnationwide lockdown for a period of 21 days with effect from 25 March 2020 to\ncontain the pandemic. Pursuant to the announcement, the Ministry of Home\nAffairs, Government of India, issued an order dated 24 March 2020 under the\nDisaster Management Act 2005, setting out guidelines for state governments to\nensure consistency in application of lockdown provisions and the exceptions\ntherefrom. It is expected that states would take note of the Central\nGovernment guidelines and modify their extant orders.\n\nEmployers must assess whether their operations fall under the prohibited or\nthe permitted category in view of the state-wise orders read with the Central\nguidelines.\n\n**What would constitute 'essential services'?**  \n---  \n  \nAs mentioned above, employers must review the exceptions set out in the\nlockdown orders being issued by the local administration (District Magistrate\n/ Municipal Commissioner / Police Commissioner) and the above-mentioned\nCentral guidelines dated 24 March 2020. Speaking generally, medical services,\ninternet services, banking services, media, production / warehousing /\ne-commerce of food, medicines etc., water and electricity have been recognized\nas 'essential services'. Further, manufacturing units requiring continuous\nprocess may continue, subject to the permission of the local authorities.\n\n**Are there any statutory requirements which may be triggered during\nlockdown?**  \n---  \n  \nThe lockdown may trigger the requirements of layoff under the Industrial\nDisputes Act 1947 (IDA). The IDA stipulates payment of layoff compensation to\nworkmen (non-managerial employees) during the period the employer is unable to\nprovide work to them. In addition to this, the provisions under the model /\ncertified standing orders as applicable to the establishment may have to be\nreferred to.\n\n**Can the employer declare the period of lockdown as 'leave without pay'?**  \n---  \n  \nAs regards the category of workmen, leave without pay would be difficult to\nimplement in view of the provisions of IDA. As for managerial employees,\nmanagement must strategize a plan for payment of their salaries keeping in\nview the state advisories that have been released to urge employers to not\ndeduct employees' salaries during the initial closure period.\n\n**Can the principal employer claim 'force majeure' as regards engagement of\ncontract workers through a manpower service provider?**  \n---  \n  \nPrincipal employers should review the manpower services agreement executed\nwith vendors / contractors. If there is no force majeure clause covering\nsituations of epidemic, the provisions of the Indian Contract Act 1872 will\napply. As regards COVID-19, the answer to the question of claiming force\nmajeure is not a definitive one \u2013 several factors including the local\nsituation, the purpose of engagement of contract workers, the possible means\nof fulfilment of the terms of contract etc. will have to be assessed.\n\n_The content of this document do not necessarily reflect the views/position of\nKhaitan & Co but remain solely those of the author(s).

In this piece, Tanya Jansen\nexplores how the tech industry can lead the way in creating equal\ncompensation, writes**_ _**Tanya Jansen, co-founder of beqom.**_\n\nDespite being one of the highest-paying industries in the world, the\ntechnology field has a gender pay gap problem. In fact, a recent\n[report](https://www.comparably.com/news/study-10-popular-tech-jobs-that-pay-\nmore-than-150k/) by Comparably found, men are paid up to $16,000 more than\nwomen with the same title. Additionally, 21% of enterprise technology\nemployees believe their place of work has issues with equal pay.\n\nIn the last few years, well-known technology companies have brought attention\nto the pay gap plaguing the industry. Adobe committed to closing the gap by\npaying women $1.00 for every $1.00 earned by a male employee in the U.S.\nMcAfee announced that it achieved global gender pay parity earlier this year\nafter it conducted an audit of its operations in 45 countries and across more\nthan 7,000 employees. While these companies and others have addressed the pay\ngap at their organizations, there is still room for improvement within the\ntechnology industry to set a higher standard in compensation.\n\nCompensation is a point of contention for employees in every field; more than\na third (37%) say they would seek a job at a company that disclosed a lower\ngender pay gap than their current employer. Job openings currently outnumber\njob seekers, challenging companies to create a competitive differentiator to\nsecure the right candidates. As 40% of technology workers believe the gender\npay gap at their place of work has increased in the past 12-18 months, and\nfrills like free artisanal coffee and meditation rooms no longer convince\ncandidates to accept a position, fair compensation can be a key\ndifferentiator.\n\nAs innovators in workplace culture and trendsetters in business, technology\ncompanies are well-positioned to lead efforts in closing the pay gap. To\nbecome a leader in equal pay, technology companies should focus on two areas:\nimplementing automated compensation solutions and emphasizing transparent pay\npractices.\n\n## **Implement Technology as a Compensation Standard**\n\nTechnology industry leaders looking to upend compensation management in their\norganizations should consider implementing total compensation systems to\ndesign competitive and fair pay packages. This technology takes the guesswork\nand emotion out of compensation management to create a pay structure free of\nunconscious bias. Additionally, it ensures compensation methods are compliant\nwith ever-evolving state and national regulations and up-to-date with industry\nstandards. For example, many states have implemented regulations prohibiting\nemployers from asking salary history questions to job applicants. Compensation\ntechnology can help businesses create compensation structures based on more\nrelevant factors than the previous salary.\n\nAlthough salary is one area to focus on when evaluating compensation, it\u2019s not\nthe only important factor. Nearly a third (29%) of technology workers believe\na lack of benefits is the biggest workplace issue at their current job. By\nimplementing total compensation technology, employers can fairly personalize\nbenefits to incentivize employees. Additionally, employers can leverage total\ncompensation technology to identify employees whom they may consider to be a\n\u201cflight risk\u201d and create personalized plans to retain and encourage talent.\nFor example, if an employee has been missing work ahead of a big project\ndeadline, guaranteeing a bonus once the project is delivered may motivate and\nprovide an incentive worth staying for.\n\n## **Use Transparency to Drive Change**\n\nTechnology employees do not believe that closing the gender pay gap is high on\ntheir employers\u2019 priority list. In fact, 21% of technology workers believe\ntheir employer is not taking steps or actions to close or prevent gender pay\ngaps, and the same number (21%) believe their employer does not take closing\nthe gender pay gap seriously. This proves the need for additional transparency\nin communication around compensation.\n\nNearly half (46%) of workers would share their salary with colleagues,\ncreating an open and transparent discussion around compensation. But problems\narise when employers are left out of these conversations, which can result in\nrumors or hearsay since salary does not show the complete compensation\npicture. Instead, employers should consider providing dynamic total reward\nstatements measuring employees\u2019 entire compensation packages, including base\nsalary, bonuses, benefits, and perks. Employees can compare these statements\nto industry benchmarks to provide additional insight into their compensation\npackages and better understand their value to the organization.\n\n**Learn More:[The Gender Pay Gap Is About More Than Compensation: What Google\nand Others Should Know](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/diversity/the-\ngender-pay-gap-is-about-more-than-compensation-what-google-and-others-should-\nknow/)**\n\n## **Creating Change in Industries Beyond Technology**\n\nTechnology companies have an opportunity to set a higher standard for fair\ncompensation. The industry\u2019s forward-thinking approaches to solving workplace\nproblems, such as streamlining remote working communication, show its ability\nto disrupt age-old processes. Intel broke barriers in compensation standards\nas one of the first companies in the U.S. to announce it would voluntarily\nrelease pay data broken down by gender and ethnicity. Through this move, Intel\nset a high standard in pay reporting for all employers and employees. Given\n[63% of employees](https://www.beqom.com/gender-pay-gap-what-your-employees-\nreally-think-survey-report) would be more willing to work at a company that\ndiscloses its gender pay gap figures each year, other organizations looking to\nstay competitive in recruitment and retention should consider adopting\ntransparent compensation policies.\n\nDisclosing pay gaps and publicizing efforts to create equal pay are key to\nguiding other industries in the right direction. As more organizations commit\nto fair and equal pay, those that fall behind will begin to feel pressure from\nemployees and will lose top talent and prospective candidates who instead\naccept jobs with organizations committed to equal pay.\n\nChanging the gender pay gap will not happen instantly, and it\u2019s not up to one\ncompany \u2014 or even one industry \u2014 to make the change; however, some technology\ncompanies have begun to take the lead, and it\u2019s my hope that others follow.\nIt's a gradual process, but the more that companies across all industries\nbegin to close the pay gap, the closer we\u2019ll get to gender equality.\n\n**Learn More:[Compensation Trends Companies Must\nIncorporate](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-\nadministration/compensation-trends-companies-must-incorporate/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fcompensation-\nbenefits%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=How+The+Tech+Industry+Can+Lead+the+Way+in+Creating+Equal+Compensation\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+The+Tech+Industry+Can+Lead+the+Way+in+Creating+Equal+Compensation&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fcompensation-\nbenefits%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fcompensation-\nbenefits%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fcompensation-\nbenefits%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=How The Tech Industry Can Lead the Way in\nCreating Equal\nCompensation&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fcompensation-\nbenefits%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Compensation & Benefits ](/category/compensation-\nbenefits/ \"Compensation & Benefits\")\n\n  * [ ![Employee Benefits Trends 2020: 5 Ways to Benefit](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/five_employee_benefits_trends_for_2020_5e15b8a64ea0e.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/compensation-benefits/employee-benefits-trends-2020/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Employee Benefits Trends 2020: 5 Ways to Benefit\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/compensation-benefits/employee-\nbenefits-trends-2020/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nIs your benefits catalog 2020-ready?

the illness, without causing\npanic, experts say.\n\nBy: [Andrew R. McIlvaine](https://hrexecutive.com/author/andrew-r-mcilvaine/\n\"Posts by Andrew R. McIlvaine\") | February 10, 2020 \u2022 6 min read\n\nTopics: [Benefits and\nCompensation](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/) |\n[Coronavirus](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/) | [Employment\nLaw](https://hrexecutive.com/category/employmentlaw/) |\n[Healthcare](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/healthcare/)\n| [HR Leadership](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrleadership/) | [Talent\nManagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/) |\n[Wellness](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/wellness/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/Coronavirus.Getty_.2.10.20-700x467.jpg)\n\n(Photo by Jenny Evans/Getty Images)\n\nThere\u2019s a virus that\u2019s currently ravaging the U.S. So far this season, it\u2019s\ncaused at least 22 million illnesses, 210,000 hospitalizations and 12,000\ndeaths.\n\nThe cause of this scourge is the general influenza virus, which is wreaking\nmore havoc than usual across the country this winter. In 2018, the flu cost\nU.S. companies $18 billion in lost productivity, reports Gartner. However, a\ndifferent virus has received far more media coverage and is stirring much more\nanxiety: the coronavirus, which has caused a near economic shutdown in China\nand has prompted travelers returning from that country to undergo special\nscreening and possible quarantine.\n\n**The latest:**[ **\u2018Handshake-free\u2019 meetings and other coronavirus\nprecautions**](https://hrexecutive.com/handshake-free-meetings-and-other-\ncoronavirus-precautions/)\n\nAlthough organizations must take precautions to guard their employees from\ncoronavirus, experts are concerned that fear and misinformation could\nultimately land companies in legal jeopardy.\n\nAttorney Bob Nichols, who counseled clients through the SARS virus of 2003 and\nthe H1N1 virus of 2009, says misinformation about coronavirus may be a bigger\nthreat in the U.S. at the moment than the virus itself. So far, only 18 cases\nhave been reported in the U.S., although that number is likely to rise.\n\n\u201cThe [common flu](https://hrexecutive.com/cost-of-the-flu/), which is worse\nthis year than most, is a much more significant threat to U.S. workers than\nthe coronavirus,\u201d says Nichols, a partner at Bracewell LP in Houston. \u201cThe\nmost important thing HR leaders can do is to maintain that perspective and\nguard against over-reaction.\u201d\n\nBy providing employees with accurate information about coronavirus, HR can\nmaintain good order and protect the organization against potential liability,\nhe says. The [Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and the\n[Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/novel_coronavirus/) have good\ninformation on their websites that HR can share with employees to ensure\nthey\u2019re relying on facts, not hearsay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\u201cKeep them aware of the CDC guidance on this topic and that will keep them\ncalm,\u201d says Nichols.\n\nFears about the coronavirus are understandable. As of Monday, the virus has\nkilled more than 900 people in China\u2014including 97 just on Feb. 9\u2014and infected\nmore than 40,000 globally, [reports CNN](https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-\nnews/coronavirus-outbreak-02-10-20-intl-hnk/index.html). Scientists still\naren\u2019t entirely sure how the virus is transmitted and, for now, there is no\nvaccine to guard against it. Government agencies and pharmaceutical companies\nare working to develop a coronavirus vaccine, but it will be months before one\nis ready.\n\nNevertheless, companies shouldn\u2019t allow fear to dictate their response to the\nthreat or rumors to undermine employee morale.\n\n\u201cSo as to avoid the spread of misinformation, HR should endeavor to ensure\nthat employees aren\u2019t sharing false information or gossiping about others,\u201d\nsays Susan Gross Sholinksy, a member of the employment, labor and workforce\nmanagement practice at Epstein Becker Green.\n\nEmployers should also ensure that employees aren\u2019t refusing to interact with\ncolleagues and/or customers who are of Asian descent, she adds. Such behavior\ncould lead to complaints about discrimination based on national origin and\nethnicity, or it could even be \u201cregarded as\u201d disability discrimination.\n\n\u201cRather, any actions taken (or avoided) should be based on whether an\nindividual is likely to have been exposed to the virus,\u201d Gross Sholinsky says.\n\n**\u201cSimple But Important Steps\u201d**\n\nThe blanket media coverage of coronavirus is a good reminder for HR\ndepartments to emphasize preventative steps for guarding the workplace against\nall viruses, says Dr. Teresa Bartlett, senior vice president and medical\ndirector at Sedgwick. It\u2019s especially timely given this season\u2019s virulent flu\noutbreak.\n\nBartlett, who regularly consults with large company clients, says the No. 1\npriority should be reviewing the company\u2019s illness and absence policies and\nreminding employees about them.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want people coming to work sick,\u201d she says. \u201cSet clear guidelines:\n\u2018If you have a cough, a cold, upper-respiratory-illness symptoms, then we\ndon\u2019t want you at work.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen possible, allow people to work from home, says Bartlett.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to have clear guidelines for workplace behavior,\nparticularly during a flu outbreak, she says.\n\n\u201cCounsel employees to consider bumping elbows in lieu of shaking hands,\u201d says\nBartlett. Limit in-person meetings when possible, have hand sanitizer widely\navailable and remind folks to cough into their elbow, not their hand, she\nsays.\n\nCommon surfaces should be sanitized as often as possible, says Bartlett.\n\u201cDoorknobs, elevator buttons, surfaces in the cafeteria\u2014even toilet handles.\nSanitizing these surfaces will go a long way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are simple but important steps,\u201d she adds.\n\n**Lessons from Past Outbreaks**\n\nHR should have a plan ready to deploy should any major outbreak wreak havoc on\ncompany operations, says Bartlett. Such a plan should be created in\npartnership with other departments, including risk management, finance and IT,\nshe says.\n\n\u201cHave something you can easily turn to during times like this,\u201d says Bartlett.\n\nViral outbreaks that occurred earlier this century offer some useful lessons.\nA [recent report from\nGartner](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-questions-for-an-hr-\npandemic-plan/) summarizes the steps taken by companies in the wake of the\nSARS and H1N1 viruses, which also originated in Asia and posed major potential\ndisruptions to the global economy. In the wake of these outbreaks, American\nExpress set up criteria to validate the threats of the next pandemic. It\nincluded both the impact on the business and the impact on the community to\ndetermine \u201cthresholds for action.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nGoodyear focused on having a plan in place to ensure \u201ccritical roles\u201d would be\nmaintained in the event of a pandemic. Each business unit or region was asked\nto identify critical roles. Next, the company organized those roles by\ncategory: essential, temporary suspension and extended suspension (roles that\ncould be suspended without undue harm to the business). Goodyear analyzed its\ntalent bench to determine the difficulty of backfilling essential roles and\nmade adjustments as necessary.\n\n**For China-Based Employees**\n\nOrganizations that have expatriate employees in China or a significant\nworkforce there should carefully monitor travel guidelines to the region, says\nthe Business Group on Health (formerly the National Business Group on Health).\nThe BGH has released [guidelines for\nemployers](https://www.businessgrouphealth.org/topics/blog/the-evolving-\nsituation-of-coronavirus-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont) that have significant\nbusiness in Asia, noting that the U.S. State Dept. has advised against travel\nto China.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Level 4: Do Not Travel\u2019 advisory is the highest level of warning the\nState Department gives for travel,\u201d the BGH notes.\n\nFor companies concerned that an employee was exposed to coronavirus, law firm\nLittler [recommends](https://www.littler.com/publication-\npress/publication/coronavirus-employer-action-items) instructing the employee\nto stay home for up to 14 days to ensure they don\u2019t show symptoms of the\nvirus. The employee should not return to work until they\u2019ve received a\n\u201cfitness-for-duty/return-to-work\u201d notice.\n\nIf an employee has contracted coronavirus, Littler advises contacting the CDC\nand the local health department immediately and having a hazmat company clean\nand disinfect the workplace. Other employees should be notified and the\ncompany should consider allowing employees to expense medical tests for\ndetecting the virus.\n\nCompanies must proceed carefully, taking care to ensure their policies for\ndealing with coronavirus don\u2019t unwittingly discriminate: \u201cIt is possible, and\nindeed likely, that the coronavirus will disproportionately affect members of\na protected class. While the risk of discrimination is likely small, employers\nmust be cognizant of this fact \u2026 .\u201d says Littler.\n\n\u201cEmployers should ensure that employees aren\u2019t improperly creating a hostile\nenvironment for employees of Asian descent due simply to their national origin\nor ethnicity,\u201d says Gross Sholinsky.\n\nAndrew R.

brought to you by [Willis Towers\nWatson](http://bit.ly/3akdLSC).\n\n### _From ideas on the most innovative rewards programmes to understanding the\npsychology of pay in making better C &B decisions, Shai Ganu, Executive\nCompensation Global Practice Leader, Willis Towers Watson, tells all in this\ninterview._\n\n### Q A lot of research points to employees being unable to understand their\nrewards fully, and thus not being able to appreciate the company investment in\nthem. Why do we continue to face this challenge, and what's the way out?\n\nIndeed, companies spend a lot of money on different reward programmes, yet the\nperceived value by employees tends to be quite low. We\u2019ve had several\nconversations with very seasoned and financially-numerate business leaders who\nclaim that their rewards plans are too complex, or that they don\u2019t understand\nall the incentive plans. By definition, incentives are meant to encourage\nachievement of goals and specific business outcomes; how can that happen if\npeople do not understand the plans to begin with?\n\nThe cause, and solution, to this issue may sound obvious, yet is not easy to\nimplement. All the research we have done comes down to three fundamental\nquestions that every employee wants the answers to:\n\n  * Communication - \u201cAm I paid fairly for what I do?\u201d\n  * Motivation \u2013 \u201cHow can I earn more?\u201d\n  * Flexibility \u2013 \u201cWhat is right for me and my family?\u201d\n\nMost companies spend a lot of time on design and modeling of incentive\narrangements. Whilst that is important, progressive companies spend as much if\nnot more effort, on active engagement with employees to address these issues.\n\nWillis Towers Watson has partnered with several of our clients to effective\npay communications \u2013 from individualised total rewards statements, to\nsoftware-enabled dashboards that track value of different pay plans, to nudges\nrelated to pay and benefits related elections, to application of behavioral\neconomics in providing flexibility in incentive plans.\n\n### Q This leads us nicely into the psychology of pay - you've previously said\nthat most of us tend to make economically irrational decisions. How does this\naffect pay programmes?\n\nPsychology of pay is an important research topic for us globally and across\nthe region. We have conducted studies in Singapore and 15 other countries, and\nacross board members, CEOs, executives, and HR teams \u2013 and\ncultural/socioeconomic differences notwithstanding the findings are fairly\nconsistent: human beings often make economically irrational choices.\n\nFor example, we asked people whether, all other things being equal, would they\nwould prefer to get (a) $1 million today; or (b) $1.5 million in 24 months? As\nyou can imagine, the economically rational option would be (b) \u2014 after all,\nthere aren\u2019t too many risk-free investment options that would yield returns of\n22.5% each year. However, nearly two-thirds choose the $1 million today.\nAlthough this is not the economically rational option, it suggests that\nemployees discount heavily for time.\n\nUnderstanding these employee attitudes may have strong implications on\ncompensation models. For example, would a company achieve stronger performance\nand retention with a long-term incentive plan that could deliver a large\npayout after five years, or with a plan that delivers smaller payouts each\nyear?\n\nAt Willis Towers Watson, we apply these behavioral economics concepts, and our\nresearch findings to rewards consulting assignments. In our engagement with\nclients, we run experiments within different teams in a company to study\nimpact of different compensation models of performance and behavioral\noutcomes.\n\nIf executed properly, the application of psychology of pay could prove very\nmotivational an engaging to employees and can provide a unique competitive\nadvantage to companies.\n\n> ##### Companies are increasingly beginning to challenge conventional wisdom,\n> and adopt bespoke practices tailored for their context. Indeed, \u2018best fit\u2019\n> is more important than \u2018market practice\u2019 or \u2018best practice\u2019.\n\n### Q What are some of the innovative rewards programmes that you've seen in\nthe industry?\n\nWhile all reward programmes need to be market competitive, innovative plans\ncan help provide a competitive advantage in hiring, engaging, and recruiting\nkey talent. Key themes tend to be around segmentation, customisation,\nproductivity, career rewards, new instruments, and risk-reward trade-offs.\n\n**Below are some (non-exhaustive) examples that Willis Towers Watson has\nsuccessfully implemented with our clients in the region:**\n\n  * Choose your own pay mix \u2013 Allow flexibility within set total compensation levels for executives to choose their preferred incentive mix, in line with their risk-reward appetite; the intent is to tailor models that will motivate executives the most.\n  * Pay for productivity \u2013 This helps to balance compensation with affordability; by determining ROI of incentive plans and market benchmarking of compensation as a % of financial returns;\n  * Total compensation funding \u2013 Rather than set a bonus pool funding, consider total compensation funding as a preset % of profits. The model gives more autonomy to managers to balance base pay, STI, LTI; but may lead to more volatile outcomes.\n  * Bonus banking \u2013 Each year, the bonus \u2018declared\u2019 amount go into a notional bank, and executives can withdraw only one-third of the bank (rest carries forward to next year\u2019s opening balance). This reduces volatility of bonus payouts; in good years bonus payouts are not very high, and in bad years bonus outcomes are not very low.\n  * Token-based incentives \u2013 Cryptocurrencies are used as the incentive instrument. All parties are incentivised to increase the value of underlying tokens; while employee performance is judged and their reward based on reputation points.\n  * Individual reward programmes \u2013 Employees are allocated points, with a fixed points-conversion table for additional base salary increase, leave, benefits etc. This allows each colleague to create a unique reward basket based on their specific life requirements (i.e. mass customisation).\n\nCompanies are increasingly beginning to challenge conventional wisdom, and\nadopt bespoke practices tailored for their context. Indeed, \u2018best fit\u2019 is more\nimportant than \u2018market practice\u2019 or \u2018best practice\u2019.\n\n### Q Let's move into executive compensation - could you share with us some\nkey developments that you anticipate as we enter a new decade?\n\nPopulism, stagnation of global economy, media and political unhappiness, are\nputting pressure on governments to legislate on executive pay matters and\ncausing shareholders to be more active. In this macro-economic backdrop, how\nexecutive pay is set, managed and communicated is becoming increasingly\nsensitive. Executive pay programmes have become more complex and have also\ncome under closer scrutiny than before.\n\nTo help balance talent and governance risks, and drive business performance,\nWillis Towers Watson\u2019s executive compensation team provides expert, research-\ndriven executive compensation advice to our clients. The evolution of\ncorporate governance models around the world behooves us to support boards and\nmanagement teams to navigate complex issues related to:\n\n  * Increased transparency and disclosures;\n  * Stronger shareholder oversight, accountability, and voting power;\n  * Shareholder vs stakeholder primacy;\n  * Push for stronger evidence of pay-for-performance alignment and rewarding value creation;\n  * Stricter boundaries on executive pay quanta and shareholding requirements;\n  * Change in pay-mix and institutional deleveraging of pay;\n  * Defensibility of pay programmes and risk of homogenising practices;\n  * Stronger linkage to sustainability and ESG measures;\n  * Risk-based compensation models, including ex-post adjustments;\n  * Greater comparison of pay in comparison to wider workforce.\n\nCloser to home, key focus will be on equity and incentive plans. Companies\nspend millions of dollars on share plans, yet their perceived value to\nexecutives remains very low. When incentive plans fail, it is usually because\nof sub-optimal communication, or lack of proper target setting. If targets are\ntoo easy, the risk is that incentives end up becoming an entitlement; if they\nare too stretched, then risk it that they become a disincentive.\n\n> ##### If targets are too easy, the risk is that incentives end up becoming\n> an entitlement; if they are too stretched, then risk it that they become a\n> disincentive.\n\nTo help our clients we developed a proprietary tool that takes a probabilistic\nview when setting targets. This allows companies to select the right KPIs for\nshort and long-term incentive plans, and to set appropriate threshold-target-\nstretch levels of performance. We also work with clients to better communicate\nincentive plans, prepare quarterly tracking statements, combine short and\nlong-term plans into a single scheme, have more differentiated (e.g.\nquarterly) vesting, select appropriate KPIs, etc. All of which are designed to\nincrease the perceived value of incentives, and achieve stronger alignment\nwith business goals, and between management and stakeholders\u2019 interests.\n\n### Q On that note, where do you see remuneration committees headed, in terms\nof their focus on human capital management?\n\nHuman capital is one the most vital assets of any organisation. If you ask any\nchair or CEO about their top priorities, invariably most would say \u2018people\u2019.\nFrom the shareholders\u2019 perspective, it then follows that organisations should\nhave similar levels of emphasis and transparency regarding investments in\nhuman capital, as they do with financial capital.\n\nWillis Towers Watson conducted a global meta-study that reveals a compelling\nand predictive link between human capital management and company\u2019s superior\nfinancial performance. covering over 500 companies, close to 50 years of data,\nand a total database approaching 250mn employees, we found that companies\ndemonstrating a strong employee experience consistently beat their sector on\naverage by a clear margin of 2-4% across all key financial metrics. In\ncontrast, companies delivering less effective employee experience consistently\nunderperformed peers by up to 10%.\n\nProgressive boards actively monitor and disclose key human capital metrics as\npart of their environmental social governance (ESG) and sustainability\nreporting \u2013 with particular focus on inclusion & diversity, gender pay equity,\ntalent management and retention, health and safety, training and education,\njobs creation, and skills for the future. Similarly, progressive remuneration\ncommittees (RC) have risen to the challenge and have expanded their remits and\nterms of reference to include broader human capital management and ESG issues.\n\nOur executive compensation and governance consultants work closely with\nclients, locally and globally, to include next-generation human capital goals\nin executive pay programmes, and provide intelligent dashboards and software\nto boards, RCs, and the C-suite. This is an important business and social\nimperative that warrants strong attention from the most senior levels in an\norganisation.\n\n* * *\n\n_To get in touch with Shai Ganu, or the team at Willis Towers Watson, for\nadvice on your rewards and executive compensation strategies, please write to\nhim\nat[shai.ganu@willistowerswatson.com](mailto:shai.ganu@willistowerswatson.com),\nor contact [the team here](http://bit.ly/3akdLSC)._\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

allocate the largest amount of their payroll budget\nto bonuses in the history of Aon's 43-year study.\n\nStructured bonus programs reached record-high funding levels this year and\n[are projected to do the same](https://rewards.aon.com/en-\nus/insights/articles/2019/aon-2019-2020-us-salary-increase-survey) in 2020,\nsays Ken Abosch, an employee rewards consulting leader at Aon, a global\nconsulting firm.\n\nOn average, he says, companies in 2020 are planning to budget 13.1% of payroll\nfor bonus expenses, up from 12.9% in 2019 and 12.5% in 2018.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, these bonuses aren\u2019t for everyone, like clerical or hourly\nworkers,\u201d Abosch says. \u201cThis has been a long-standing trend that hasn\u2019t budged\nvery much \u2026 about 25% of hourly workers are covered by these types of\narrangements.\u201d\n\n[Like other incentive plans](https://hrexecutive.com/incentives-in-the-age-of-\nattrition/), bonus programs have evolved over the decades. Among the most\npopular are individual employee-performance plans (23% offer such bonuses,\naccording to a recent Aon survey of roughly 400 mid-to large-size employers)\nand special recognition plans (52% offered spot bonuses in 2019, compared to\n51% in 2017, reports Aon). However, the trend is shifting toward business-\nincentive plans or bonuses based on multiple performance layers, such as\noverall company results, individual performance and business unit outcomes.\nThis year, approximately 85% of organizations surveyed by Aon have adopted\nthis approach, up from 77% in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n\n\u201cWhen employees below the executive level started getting bonuses, 80% to 90%\nwere individual-performance plans \u2026 a discretionary award given at the end of\nthe year based on a manager\u2019s judgement,\u201d Abosch says. \u201cManagers weren\u2019t\nreally equipped to make good decisions, so they eliminated those plans, which\nbecame profit-sharing plans that focused more or less on company performance\ninstead of individual performance.\u201d\n\n**Related:[Big blue-collar bonuses](https://hrexecutive.com/signing-bonuses-\nas-incentives/)**\n\nHowever, he says, many companies don\u2019t support spot bonuses, believing they\u2019re\ndifficult to manage, aren\u2019t valued by employees and don\u2019t motivate workers.\nUnfortunately, some employers or managers have watered them down by handing\nthem out to all staff throughout the year. But others have designed a\nselection process and are now realizing their powerful impact. Since spot\nbonuses are awarded shortly after an employee accomplishment, Abosch says,\n\u201cthe psychic income value is greater than the actual monetary value.\u201d\n\nStill, business-incentive plans are by far the most popular because they\nenable companies to accomplish alignment and line of sight. Research has shown\nthe importance of making sure employees are aligned to the company\u2019s\nobjectives and goals and thinking about how to help drive them, he explains.\n\n\u201cMore high-performance organizations have come to the realization that broad-\nbased variable pay is the most effective way to send a strong pay-for-\nperformance message and truly differentiate rewards for high performers versus\nlow performers,\u201d Abosch says. \u201cThis form of compensation has evolved from a\nnice-to-have or thank you at the end of the year to a meaningful weapon in the\narsenal of tools that motivate employees to achieve required business\nresults.\u201d\n\n**Bigger Bonuses, Broader Base**\n\nSmall organizations have more wiggle room when awarding bonuses. Consider St.\nJohn Properties, a real estate company that[ divvied up $10 million among its\n198 employees in\nbonuses](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/12/10/real-estate-company-\nsurprises-198-employees-10-million-bonus/4384763002/) at its holiday party\nthis year. Based on tenure, the bonuses ranged from $100, given to an employee\nwho hadn\u2019t stared his job yet, to $270,000 for a longtime employee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n\nAlthough that\u2019s not realistic for large organizations employing thousands of\nworkers, 48% of companies that offer holiday or year-end bonuses plan to\neither increase them or keep them the same, according to a [2019 survey\nconducted by Robert Half](http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2019-12-03-48-Of-\nCompanies-That-Offer-Year-End-Bonuses-Plan-To-Increase-Them-Survey-Finds.), a\nglobal recruiting firm. Yet, 4% anticipate reducing them. The research found\nthat organizations in Nashville, Austin, Denver and Minneapolis are most\nlikely to increase bonuses.\n\n\u201cOver the last couple of years, companies seem to be investing and engaging in\nthese markets,\u201d says Luke Stratmann, metro market manager at Robert Half. He\nbelieves the bonus increases may be needed to attract more skilled talent to\nthese communities.\n\nAnother trend is enhancing transparency. He says more employees receive\nbonuses out in the open, in front of their peers, where they can be cheered\nand applauded for specific accomplishments.\n\n**See also:[The 6 key elements of employee\nexperience](https://hrexecutive.com/the-6-key-elements-of-employee-\nexperience/)**\n\nIn the future, Stratmann believes bonuses will be handed out \u201call the way from\nthe top to the absolute bottom of an organization if we continue to exist in\nthe current employee climate.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, OneDigital has been advising its clients to be more creative\nregarding bonuses, says Stacy Strauser, director of compensation consulting at\nthe employee-benefits and health-consulting firm.\n\nWhile cash remains king, she says, examples of creative bonuses include\ntraining opportunities or enabling employees to work from home for one month.\nAlso consider awarding bonuses to larger groups and for more reasons like\nhelping co-workers complete a task, demonstrating the organization\u2019s values or\nserving as an exceptional team member.\n\n\u201cHave your ducks in a row and document the bonus program in advance, on your\nwebsite,\u201d says Strauser, adding that a website posting could say that employee\nbonuses are based on tenure and the result of the company\u2019s outstanding year.\n\u201cAlways tie bonuses to employee or company performance, and make sure\nemployees know that bonuses are not an entitlement.\u201d\n\nCarol Patton is a contributing editor for _HRE_ who also writes HR articles\nand columns for business and education magazines.

These activities focus on determining\nmethods for setting up the sales team so they can sell to their customers in\nthe most efficient and successful way possible.\n\nSales operations leaders implement strategies, processes, and resources that\nenable sales teams to close deals and drive results. Overall, the idea is to\nmake the sales team within the business as systematic as possible.\n\nThe purpose of bringing about this systematic element is so sales reps can\nmaster the [process of selling](/sales-process) that works for their\ncustomers. It also enables leaders to track progress and pick out areas within\nthe sales process that need to be improved.\n\n## Sales operations vs. sales\n\nYou might\u2019ve already guessed, but let\u2019s clarify the difference between sales\noperations and sales teams to avoid any future confusion.\n\nThe sales team is a customer-facing revenue generator. They are out in the\nfield communicating with clients, moving them down the pipeline, and closing\ndeals.\n\nThe sales operations team is the behind-the-scenes sidekick for the sales\nteam. They evaluate the sales team\u2019s current methods, find areas for\nimprovement, and recommend strategies accordingly.\n\nEssentially, the sales team looks to the sales operations team for information\non how to improve their current approach to selling.\n\n## Sales operations vs. sales enablement\n\nSales operations and sales enablement are often confused with one another.\nThey both support the sales team in reaching their goals, but they are\ndistinctly different.\n\nSales operations focuses on things the sales team is currently doing and has\ndone in the past. They analyze data and make decisions that will improve the\nprocesses and strategies currently being implemented by the sales team. The\nsales enablement team will then implement and roll out those decisions.\n\n![sales ops vs sales enablement](https://learn.g2.com/hs-\nfs/hubfs/sales%20ops%20vs%20sales%20enablement%20vs%20sales.png?width=600&name=sales%20ops%20vs%20sales%20enablement%20vs%20sales.png)\n\nTo ensure your sales team is successful, your sales, sales operations, and\nsales enablement teams need to align. A common struggle between these teams is\ncrossover of responsibilities. Make sure to give each team their own goals and\ndeliverables while also syncing them with those of the other departments. This\nway, there won\u2019t be any confusion as to which department owns which\nresponsibilities.\n\n## What does sales operations do?\n\nThe importance of sales operations lies in its key purpose: to set your sales\nteam up for success. It can become too much for your sales team to sell to\nyour customers, identify problems within your sales strategy, and find\nrealistic solutions all at once.\n\nThis is where your sales operations team steps in.\n\nAs sales reps focus on generating revenue, sales operations team members will\nconcentrate on finding ways to make that easier.\n\nSales is anything but static. Your sales team can be the most skilled group of\nsellers out there, but without someone assessing their processes and creating\nnew strategies, their efficiency will struggle. Hence the importance of having\na sales operations department.\n\n## Sales operations strategy\n\nSelling is nothing without strategy. Pleasing customers is tricky, and reps\nneed to constantly re-evaluate their strategy to efficiently make customers\ncommit to a purchase.\n\nThe overall purpose of sales operations is to ensure the sales department is a\nwell-oiled machine, selling left and right with as few obstacles as possible.\nThis way, they can serve their intended purpose and benefit the business.\n\nSales operations teams will ideate, execute, and evaluate the following\nstrategies to develop, implement, and optimize their team\u2019s selling strategy.\n\n#### Recruitment, onboarding, and training\n\nThe HR department has a hand in recruiting, hiring, and onboarding, but\ncandidates also need to be evaluated by someone who has a deep knowledge of\nsales, especially the way reps work for that specific business.\n\nThe sales ops team will evaluate candidates to ensure they have what it takes\nto contribute to sales goals and that particular business. By equipping the\nsales team with new skilled team members, they are contributing to their\nefficiency.\n\nThis area of sales ops can also refer to training new and existing employees\non different processes, software programs, or tools. Being a successful sales\nteam requires that each member knows the ins and outs of each method being\nused and every resource at hand.\n\n#### Sales training evaluation\n\nSales ops also has a hand in training new team members, and ensuring the\nonboarding process is setting them up for success.\n\nFirst, they will go through the sales training process with each new rep,\ngiving them all of the information and resources they need to succeed. Then,\nthe sales ops team will assess the training program by evaluating the\nperformance of the new team member to pick out areas where they might have\nfallen short with the training.\n\nIf the new rep is struggling with cold calling, they will reassess that part\nof the training. Or if they are selling just fine the first time around but\nstruggling to retain customers, sales ops will include more information on\ncustomer relationship management and the [tools you can use to improve\nit](https://www.g2.com/categories/crm).\n\n#### Account allocation\n\nNot every rep is best suited for handling every customer. Sales ops teams can\ndesignate which rep will be handling which account by considering the\nfollowing factors:\n\n  * The rep\u2019s experience \n  * The rep\u2019s knowledge of the buyers\n  * The rep\u2019s sales quota for that time period \n  * The customer\u2019s buying process\n  * Number of accounts on hand\n\nThis is not a time to guess or make random assignments. A lack of strategy\nwhen allocating accounts is a mistake, but the sales ops team will have the\nright information for doing so in a calculated manner.\n\n#### Sales territory management\n\nSetting sales territories is more than just drawing borders on a map and\ndesignating reps to each sector.\n\nSales ops will determine each territory by first evaluating accounts at hand,\nthe territories themselves, and the skills of the sales rep. They will then\nstrategically create, manage, and set goals for the territories based on the\navailable opportunities, and place reps according to their experience and\namount of deals they can juggle at once.\n\n#### Contract management\n\nAfter a couple of renewals, keeping track of a customer\u2019s current legal stance\nwith your business can get complicated. Sales ops teams will handle contract\nmanagement, which organizes key contract stages for each customer: initiation,\nexecution, and renewal/expiry.\n\nThe purpose of having the sales ops team control contract management is to\nremain consistent with language and contract templates, saving time and\nreducing errors.\n\n#### Sales data management\n\nSales teams run on data. Let\u2019s say that again. _Sales teams run on data_.\n\nSales ops will manage the data of the entire sales team, keeping current goals\nand objectives in mind. They will use the data at hand to track progress\ntowards goals and evaluate where sales reps are excelling and where they are\nstruggling. This will include the incorporation of sales metrics.\n\nAlong with hard numbers, data management can also refer to information on\ncurrent clients. This might include contact information, descriptions of\nissues they\u2019ve come across, or the estimated value of the relationship.\n\n#### Sales process optimization\n\nYour sales process needs to align with your typical customer\u2019s buyer journey,\nand finding this happy medium requires some strategy.\n\nSales ops teams will take a deep dive into each stage of your sales process,\npaying special attention to conversion rates. If a particular conversion\nbetween two stages is struggling, sales ops will find a way to optimize that\ntransition so more customers stay in the pipeline.\n\nSales ops will optimize the sales process to focus on conversions, shortening\nthe sales-cycle length, and maximizing your win rate.\n\n#### Sales methodology optimization\n\nYour sales methodology refers to the principles and guidelines your sales reps\nfollow as they sell your solution. Essentially, it lays out specific actions\nfor a sales rep to take once the customer at hand has reached a certain point.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to ensure these approaches to your sales process  are best suited\nfor your solution and customer base. Optimizing your sales methodology goes\nhand in hand with doing the same for your sales process.\n\nThe actions your reps take need to be carefully planned. Push a prospect too\nhard, and they might feel overwhelmed. Leave them hanging with a bunch of\nunanswered questions, and they will feel frustrated. Sales ops teams will\ndetermine sets of questions to ask, rounds of content to distribute, and\nbuying signals to jump on for reps.\n\n#### Lead generation\n\nIt\u2019s possible that lead generation is a part of your sales ops team\u2019s\nresponsibilities. It\u2019s also possible that it belongs to another department or\nrole, like BDRs.\n\nEither way, generating leads for the sales team is definitely an action that\nenables them to sell more. Sales ops teams will determine strategies and\ntactics for fueling the sales pipeline full of promising leads.\n\nThe keyword there is _promising_. A full pipeline doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a\nhealthy pipeline. Sales ops will be responsible for ensuring these leads are\nlikely to convert as opposed to not being qualified to buy the solution.\n\n#### Sales metric selection\n\nMeasuring success can\u2019t happen without tracking the [right metrics for your\nsales team](/sales-metrics). Every business is different, meaning the metrics\ntracked might differ from business to business.\n\nSales operations teams are required to know the ins and outs of the business,\nand more specifically, the sales team. They will select the metrics that best\nrepresent whether the actions taken to achieve a certain goal or objective\nwere a success, a failure, or are still in progress.\n\n#### Performance metrics analysis\n\nPerformance metrics, or [sales KPIs](/sales-kpis), reveal the overall success\nof your sales team and business. Analyzing these metrics and comparing them to\nprevious time periods will help optimize every other area of your sales\noperations and business.\n\nAnalyzing sales performance metrics can also refer to determining whether or\nnot you are focusing on the right ones. Sales ops teams will ensure that key\nperformance metrics being measured directly correspond to the attainment of\nprioritized goals. If goals change or teams realize certain KPIs don\u2019t speak\nto those goals, they will take them out of the mix.\n\n#### Sales forecasting\n\nSales ops teams will analyze data, past performance, and trends to forecast\nfuture sales. Doing so accurately will allow the business to make well-\ninformed decisions and estimate what future performance should look like.\n\nA key part of sales forecasting includes picking out potential issues in the\nfuture. This way, the business can find ways to avoid or fix these problems\nbefore encountering them.\n\n#### Compensation and incentive program creation\n\nSales reps expect to be paid for their work (obviously). Sales operations will\ncraft the [compensation plans for the sales team](/sales-compensation-plan) as\nwell as incentive programs that fuel better performance.\n\nIncentives can be as simple as offering a gift card to the rep that generates\nthe most revenue, or implementing bonuses into your sales compensation plan.\n\n#### Communication channel maintenance\n\nCommunication is key in any department within your business. Sales operations\nwill ensure that communication between team members and with clients is as\nseamless as possible.\n\nGathering feedback from the sales team is crucial to maintaining communication\nchannels. Since sales ops has different responsibilities, they might not pick\nup on a common hiccup the sales team is experiencing with a certain tool.\n\n#### Software selection\n\nYour sales team\u2019s software tools should help their efficiency in selling, not\nhinder it. There is plenty of strategy behind choosing the right software\nsolution for a sales team. It\u2019s the duty of sales ops to equip sales reps with\nan enabling set of software solutions and other tools they might need to\nsucceed.\n\n#### Sales tool optimization\n\nYour sales team is likely using more than one sales tool at once. This can\ncomplicate things, and transferring information between different software can\nbe tedious.\n\nSales ops teams will integrate all your tools, ensuring that all the software\nis acting as one system. This way, all the systems will cooperate to\nultimately deliver the specific functionality your business is looking for.\n\n**Related:** It\u2019s possible that your team has more software than necessary.\nYou\u2019re not alone - plenty of businesses waste their software spend on\nduplicate tools. Use [G2 Track](https://track.g2.com/) to manage your software\nspend and find duplicate software solutions you can get rid of.\n\n## Sales operations metrics\n\nEach department within your business is going to track metrics that best\nrepresent their success or areas that need improvement. Because most\ndepartments focus on different goals, their metrics will vary.\n\nHowever, in the case of sales and sales operations, since they both have a\nprimary goal of generating business and revenue for the company, some of their\nmetrics will overlap and some will remain specific to that department.\n\nSales operations will also pay special attention to the metrics of the sales\nteam because they use that past data to make decisions for the future.\n\nHere are a couple of metrics that sales ops teams will always have an eye on.\n\n#### New hire ramp-up time\n\nSales ops teams will measure the average amount of time it takes for a new\nhire to ramp up to gauge the effectiveness of their current onboarding\nprogram. A new hire has officially \u201cramped up\u201d once they become fully\nproductive and actually start contributing to the team.\n\n#### Quota achievement rate\n\nBecause the sales operations team is present to make the sales team\u2019s job\neasier, they need to understand how they are currently performing. Whether or\nnot reps are meeting their quota speaks directly to the success of the team.\n\nSales ops teams will look at the quota achievement rate, which shows the\npercentage of reps hitting their sales quota, to see where things currently\nare with overall success of the team.\n\n#### Conversion rate between stages\n\nSales operations teams will also need to understand the conversion rate as\nprospects move down the sales pipeline. There are three key conversions that\nare the most important to grasp:\n\n  * **Lead to opportunity ratio:** the rate at which leads convert to opportunities\n  * **Sales closing ratio:** the rate at which sent proposals convert into customers\n  * **Lead to sale ratio:** the rate at which leads convert to sales\n\n#### Sales cycle length\n\nYour business's average sales cycle length speaks to the efficiency of your\nsales team. How quickly can they convert a prospect into a customer?\n\nBoth customers and reps prefer a short sales cycle. Reps don\u2019t want to have\npotential closed deals hanging over their heads, and customers don\u2019t want to\nbe left hanging as they need support from a rep when they are trying to make a\nbuying decision.\n\nSales ops will identify slow spots in the sales pipeline and find ways to\nspeed things along.\n\n#### Deal size\n\nSales ops need to understand their business\u2019 average deal size, as it plays a\nrole in forecasting. Depending on the amount of customers currently in the\npipeline, sales cycle length, and win rate, sales reps will calculate how much\nrevenue they can expect for a particular time period.\n\n#### Weighted pipeline value\n\nWhile average deal size is important for sales ops to accurately forecast,\nthey can get a more accurate depiction of the revenue to expect from the\nweighted sales pipeline value.\n\nPipeline value refers to the amount of potential revenue currently sitting in\nthe sales pipeline. When that pipeline is weighted, that means the sales team\nhas not only  identified the value of all deals in the pipeline, but they\nplace more on the ones that are most likely to close.\n\nSales ops teams will use weighted pipeline value on top of average deal size\nto forecast sales and make informed decisions.\n\n#### Forecast accuracy\n\nOn top of tracking how well the sales team is performing, sales ops needs\ntheir own metric to make sure their efforts are successful. This metric takes\nthe form of forecast accuracy, which shows whether or nor a forecast matched\nan actual outcome.\n\nIf the sales ops team is consistently forecasting sales metrics that are\ninaccurate, they will rethink their strategy.\n\n## Sales operations organizational structure\n\nFrom the information above, you can see that the sales operations team has a\nlot of responsibilities, both in tasks and metrics to track. While the sales\noperations team structure will vary from business to business, depending on\ncompany size and structure, the work is often scattered among the following\npositions:\n\n  * **Sales operations rep:** An entry-level position, a sales ops rep is responsible for generating reports and software management. \n  * **Sales operations analyst:** With a bit more responsibility, a sales ops analyst has a more data-driven position. They are responsible for analyzing and reporting on data for the sales team. \n  * **Sales operations manager:** The sales ops manager needs an extensive knowledge of sales, as they manage, lead, and direct the department. \n  * **Director of sales operations:** The director of sales ops is responsible for working closely with the sales team to make final decisions about strategies and tactics that will support them. \n\nAnyone in any of the above positions needs to understand how the sales\ndepartment works within that particular business. The departments need to be\nin constant communication with each other, so sales ops needs to be equipped\nwith a team of collaborative, technical, and data-driven strategists. Of\ncourse, there are going to be processes set in place for sales ops teams to\nfollow, but the mission could also benefit from some out-of-the-box thinking.\n\n## Sales operations challenges\n\nThe outcome of a sales ops team\u2019s efforts shows through the sales team\u2019s\nsuccess. To ensure their hard work doesn\u2019t go unnoticed, the sales ops team\nwill have to overcome the following challenges.  \n\n![sales operations challenges](https://learn.g2.com/hs-\nfs/hubfs/sales%20operations%20challenges-2.png?width=600&name=sales%20operations%20challenges-2.png)\n\n#### Poor definition of responsibilities\n\nA lot of departments work to support the sales team: sales enablement,\ncustomer success, and even marketing. Because the overall mission of these\ndepartments is to set the sales team up for success, there can be some overlap\nand confusion when it comes to responsibilities.\n\nMake sure that each department, especially sales enablement and sales\noperations, has their own specific set of tasks and deliverables. Overlap is\ninevitable, so make sure there is an action plan for these situations.\n\n#### Lack of clear sales process\n\nIf there is no process or methodology to the way your sales team goes about\nselling, the sales ops team won\u2019t have anything to work with. Make sure your\nbusiness has a clearly defined sales process, funnel, and pipeline.\n\nThis will make the outcome of in-progress sales more predictable and give the\nsales ops team a better starting place when strategizing.\n\n#### Balancing planning and taking action\n\nThe sales and sales enablement teams are more responsible for taking action\nbased on the ops team\u2019s decision making. This can create a blurry image of\nwhen the sales ops team actually needs to take action themselves.\n\n#### Keeping up with change\n\nAs your company grows and changes, your sales operations team, strategies, and\ntactics all need to adapt with it. Keeping pace with change can be difficult,\nbut your sales operations team needs to be ready to act based on any\nalteration in the sales team or their primary goals.\n\n#### Effective collaboration\n\nEvery department within a business requires some form of collaboration within\nthat team. The sales ops team, however, can require collaboration from teams\nacross the entire company based on the sales team\u2019s current goals.\n\nGetting everyone involved and on the same page can present quite the hurdle\nfor sales operations teams.\n\n#### Obtaining buy-in\n\nThe sales operations team mostly works behind the scenes, creating strategies\nthat will make the sales team more efficient and systematic. When it comes\ntime to recommend a new strategy, process, or approach for the sales team to\nimplement, it can be tricky to immediately get 100% buy in from leadership\noutside of the ops team, since they weren\u2019t involved in the ideation process.\n\n## Sales operations best practices\n\nThe purpose of having a sales operations team is to ensure everything is set\nup to run smoothly, efficiently, and successfully for the sales team. This\nisn\u2019t something that sales ops can achieve with a one and done action.\n\nThere are a few best practices that they always need to keep top of mind.\n\n![sales operations best practices](https://learn.g2.com/hs-\nfs/hubfs/sales%20operations%20best%20practices-1.png?width=600&name=sales%20operations%20best%20practices-1.png)\n\n#### They know what the reps need\n\nWhile \u201csales\u201d is in the title of their department, the sales operations team\ndoesn\u2019t spend any of their time actually selling anything. Their duties\nrevolve around supplying the sales team with what they need to support their\ngoals, and taking care of any activity not directly related to selling.\n\nTo do so, sales ops needs to keep tabs on the sales team so they know exactly\nwhat they need to deliver.\n\n#### They have established common practices\n\nBecause sales teams and their approaches are always changing, the sales ops\nteam needs to be ready to adjust. However, this doesn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t\nhave some best practices established.\n\nMake sure that sales ops teams across all locations of your business are\ntackling their work in the same way. Things like documentation, creating\ncompensation plans, and designating territories should always remain\nconsistent to avoid any confusion.\n\n#### They have a deep understanding of pipeline analysis\n\nSales ops is all about planning the sales team\u2019s next move. But first, they\nneed to establish a sales pipeline management plan to analyze its health. This\nincludes sales ops looking at the pipeline, pointing out exactly where issues\nare arising, and strategizing a plan for avoiding them in the future.\n\nNot all data that sales ops needs to analyze falls within the sales pipeline.\nThere are other areas of sales that require data analysis, and the sales ops\nteam needs to be ready for all of it. All in all, a good sales ops best\npractice is to be comfortable analyzing and drawing conclusions from any sales\ndata handed to them.\n\n#### They recognize customer success strategies\n\nOnce a sale is made, the ops team is not done yet. Far from it, actually.\n\nSales operations is also responsible for finding ways to keep profitable\ncustomers as happy as possible. By analyzing past interactions, both\nsuccessful and not, sales ops can pick out what typically makes a customer\nleave and what keeps them coming back for more.\n\nBecause reps are on the first line of defense when a cranky customer has an\nissue with your company\u2019s solution, sales ops needs to be there to feed them\nthe right information for the particular issue that person is experiencing.\nAgain, everything they do is to lighten the burden for the sales team.\n\n#### They always have an eye on competitors\n\nIf you want one department keeping an eye on your competition, it\u2019s sales\noperations. Part of having a successful sales department is outdoing your\ncompetitors, and nobody is going to analyze them and come back with takeaways\nmore than the sales ops team.\n\nThe nature of their work has turned these people into analysts that can look\nat any opposing force and know exactly which move to make next.\n\n#### They are always communicating\n\nAnd of course, as it goes for any department within any business, sales\noperations team members need to be expert communicators.\n\nThey should not only be constantly asking for input from sales, marketing, and\ncustomer success teams to find which issues need to be addressed, but they\nalso need to be delivering outputs to those teams so everyone can be\nsupporting sales in the most efficient ways possible.\n\n##### Operate like a hero\n\nSales operations departments act as the unsung heroes of the sales department.\nThey bring the systematic elements that sales teams need to be more informed,\nefficient, and successful.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a way to revamp your sales strategy, sales operations\ncan get you there.\n\n**Because data fuels the sales operations department, dashboards are their\nbest friends.

SARS was included as an\noccupational sickness covered by the ordinance two years after the epidemic.\n\nFrontline medical workers were among the first and worst hit by the SARS\noutbreak, which claimed 299 lives in Hong Kong.\n\nMeanwhile, despite medical workers having voted to end their strike on, nurses\nhave said that they were under pressure to use fewer masks.\n\nA frontline nurse who works in isolation wards at Tuen Mun Hospital reported\nthat guidelines for disease control were unclear at such wards apparently\nbeing told by senior hospital staff that N95 protective facial masks were not\nneeded.\n\n\u201cThe use of surgical masks surged rapidly recently, and the allocation of\nmasks has to be on a prudent basis in order to ensure sufficient protective\nequipment for frontline staff,\u201d a spokesman for the hospital responded.\n\n\u201cThere are no restrictions on frontline medical workers in terms of the number\nof masks they use, but we do remind staff to be prudent in their use of\nprotective gear, including surgical masks,\u201d he added.\n\nFor more on legal responsibilities for HR during the coronavirus outbreak,\ncheck out the upcoming webinar:  [A Legal Update for HR and employer\nobligations in dealing with the novel\ncoronavirus](https://vivienpeters579.clickmeeting.com/humanresources-webinar-\nseries/register)\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

This helps managers revise or replace metrics as\ncircumstances change.\n\nManagers may push back against the added work, which involves planning,\nconducting reviews and documentation, but \"HR can help to keep managers on\ntrack,\" Spake said, by showing managers how their departments and the\norganization can benefit from discovering and remedying issues that hinder\nemployee performance.\n\nHR can also train managers to give \"impromptu feedback tailored in a way\nthat's helpful, not hurtful, and to remember that guidance is a gift, not a\nwhip.\" When pointing out problems or mistakes, use such language as \"that's\nwrong,\" not \"you're wrong,\" he noted.\n\nThese performance conversations can complement another performance management\ntrend: ratingless evaluations, Spake said.\n\nJettisoning formal employee ratings \"sometimes just leads to 'shadow ratings'\nbehind the scenes, with less transparency,\" he said. However, there are also\ngood reasons to do away with ratings, he continued. For instance, in the\ncommon ranking of 1 to 5, too often, the number an employee receives becomes\nthe center of the discussion, which eclipses more-productive conversations,\nlike how to improve performance.\n\n\"Establish a clear line of sight between performance and total rewards, even\nwithout ratings,\" Spake said.\n\nHe also suggested breaking up annual bonuses, such as paying them quarterly\ninstead of annually, so they are paid out closer to the performance that's\nbeing rewarded.\n\n_[SHRM members-only how-to guide : _ [ _How to Establish Salary\nRanges_](/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/how-to-\nguides/pages/howtoestablishsalaryranges.aspx) _]_\n\nEnsure Variable Pay Success\n\nTraditional merit-based pay systems often reward mediocre performance, whereas\na variable pay strategy rewards those employees who add the most value to the\norganization, said John A. Rubino, SHRM-SCP, founder and president of Rubino\nConsulting Services, a global human resources consulting company, during a\nJune 24 concurrent session at the conference.\n\nMost annual base pay increases in the U.S. have been in the 2.8 percent to 3.1\npercent range, \"which is no way to reward your best and brightest employees,\"\nRubino said.\n\n\"Stop pretending that you're paying for performance with base pay\nadjustments,\" he advised. The alternative is a variable pay program, with lump\nsums based on performance. Variable pay increases make it easy to see the link\nbetween results and rewards, but \"putting in place broad-based variable pay\nrequires a culture change within organizations. Some are ready for variable\npay, some are not,\" Rubino said.  \n\n\"Base pay provides a compensation baseline, for expected and predictable\nperformance improvement,\" he added. Salaries, however, grow exponentially, so\nthat each increase raises the base on which future increases are pegged.\n\"Slowing down base pay growth can at least partially fund variable pay\nprogram,\" Rubino said.\n\n\"Salary increases should be based on market value of jobs, determined by\ncomparative position analysis,\" he noted. Salary increases then become market\nadjustments.  \n\n\"Don't go down the road of variable pay until you can ensure that your\nperformance management system works,\" Rubino advised. That's because variable\npay draws on performance management metrics to determine targeted plan\npayouts.  \n\nAll employees can be included in a broad-based variable pay program, with\n[performance payouts often weighted by employee level](/hr-today/news/hr-\nnews/conference-today/Pages/2017/Evolving-Company-Culture-from-Base-Pay-to-\nComprehensive-Variable-Rewards.aspx#variable-pay). For most organizations,\nvariable payouts can range from 8 percent to 19 percent of base pay,\ndetermined by meeting individual, team and organization goals, but often these\nare paid only if the company achieves or overachieves its goals.  \n\n\"Specify what behaviors you want from employees, and structure the program\naround them,\" he said. \"Articulate what outstanding behavior is, and build it\ninto your metrics.\"\n\nInvite employees to write their own goals, aligned to business unit and\norganizational goals, Rubino recommended. Whether metrics are quantifiable\nhard measures or not, the criteria must be valid and discernable.\n\nTo avoid manager subjectivity or biases, use a rating system that solicits\nfeedback from multiple vantage points.  \n\nLike Spake, Rubino noted that employees are motivated by payouts timed close\nto the performance being rewarded. \"Consider paying semiannually or quarterly\nif all performance measures can be accurately evaluated within those time\nframes,\" he advised.  \n\n\"Top performers love variable pay. Your mediocre employees will not. Variable\npay will result in [an increase in] voluntary departures by mediocre employees\nwho just get by and who don't want to play by these rules.\"\n\nHe added, \"Be prepared for turnover when you change the culture.\"\n\nRubino warned, \"You can't change the culture of compensation from the HR\ndepartment.\" Adopting a variable pay approach \"must be supported by top\nleaders on down.\" HR, however, \"can catch the ear of senior executives\" and\nencourage them to get behind a variable pay strategy.  \n  \n\n**Related SHRM Articles :**\n\n[Employers Try Better Ways to Measure and Reward\nPerformance](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/compensation/Pages/better-ways-\nmeasure-reward-performance.aspx), _SHRM Online_ , August 2017  \n\n[Evolving Company Culture from Base Pay to Variable Rewards](/hr-\ntoday/news/hr-news/conference-today/pages/2017/evolving-company-culture-from-\nbase-pay-to-comprehensive-variable-rewards.aspx), _SHRM Online_ , June 2017  \n\n[Compensation Strategy and\nPlanning](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Compensation Strategy and Planning)\n[Critical Evaluation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Critical Evaluation)\n[Variable Pay](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Variable Pay)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Continuous+Evaluation+and+Variable+Pay+Are+Transforming+Company+Cultures&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/compensation/Pages/continuous-evaluation-and-variable-pay-transform-\ncompany-cultures.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

The key, however, is to use them\nwell.\n\nEmployee experience journey mapping borrows directly from [customer journey\nmaps](https://searchcustomerexperience.techtarget.com/tip/5-tips-for-creating-\ncustomer-journey-maps-from-buyer-personas) \\-- only, in the former case,\nemployees are the \"customers\" and their touchpoints include everything from\nprehire and onboarding through to their exit from the company. As in the\ncustomer realm, HR should segment employees and build personas to understand\nimportant touchpoints and how well those touchpoints are meeting needs or if\nthey need improvement.\n\nUnfortunately, many companies don't seem to be using employee mapping well.\n\n[According to APQC research](https://www.apqc.org/resource-library/resource-\nlisting/engagement-employee-experience-survey-report), fewer than half of\nemployers are reporting being very or extremely effective at using employee\nexperience journey mapping to engage employees, said Elissa Tucker, principal\nresearch lead for human capital management at the nonprofit, independent\nresearch organization.\n\nMost of these employers and their HR teams are in the early stages of\nidentifying touchpoints or [moments that\nmatter](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/HR-response-to-\nCOVID-19-can-kill-or-boost-employee-experience) to their employees, she said.\nFewer employers are piloting improved or redesigned touchpoints. Given the\npotential gains in retaining talent and maximizing human capital investment,\nthe quest to perfect the employee experience journey map isn't likely to lose\nsteam anytime soon.\n\nHere are some guidelines HR teams can follow to create an employee experience\njourney map designed to boost morale, bridge silos and improve employee\nretention rates.\n\n### __1\\. Use empathy to understand touchpoints\n\nOne of the primary purposes of a journey map is discovering how well a company\nis meeting employees' needs and wants.\n\nCorrectly identifying touchpoints that matter to employees is an essential\nstep, Tucker said. It entails looking at the [employee\nexperience](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/employee-\nexperience) through the eyes of employees.\n\nAdopting employees' varying viewpoints can be challenging, however, and HR\nteams may fall into the trap of old habits, yesterday's methods or confusion\nover the purpose of an employee experience map, too, she said.\n\nIt's easy to fall into the trap of valuing employee experience journey mapping\nas a useful business process rather than valuing the people the process\nilluminates. However, keeping the focus on individuals is the only way HR\nteams can ensure the process succeeds.\n\n\"A people-centric approach helps tailor experiences to the unique\ncharacteristics of an individual throughout their employment journey, from\nhiring to exiting, encouraging employee engagement and retention as a result,\"\nsaid Justin Black, head of people science at Glint Inc., an employee\nengagement platform.\n\n\"For each part of the journey, ask yourself two questions: What's the employee\ntrying to achieve, and what potential roadblocks [are] they most likely to\nface?\" said Pete Sosnowski, head of HR and co-founder at Zety, an online\nresume builder.\n\nIn other words, use a journey map to understand what employees experienced\nduring important touchpoints. Was a touchpoint successful, or did it leave the\nemployee unsatisfied -- and, if so, why? These are the types of questions HR\nshould be asking.\n\n### __2\\. Understand when to gather feedback\n\nWhile personalizing the experience means understanding what matters to each\nindividual employee, HR teams must be careful about how much involvement from\nthe employee they need in order to do the mapping.\n\n \"The crucial thing is not to ask for any information [about the journey]\nduring the application process because you don't want to overwhelm the\ncandidates as they are applying,\" said Dmytro Okunyev, founder of Chanty, an\nAI-powered team chat. \"Only ask for the crucial information which is necessary\nto get the candidate to apply.\"\n\nOnce candidates have accepted the job offer, that's when HR teams can [start\ngathering feedback](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/15-essential-\nemployee-engagement-survey-questions).\n\n\"Ask them to fill out a brief survey once per month, detailing their most\nimportant highlights in their role during the month,\" he said. \"You will be\nable to identify those crucial moments for each department, role and employee\nso that you can create better employee experiences when you hire again.\"\n\n### __3\\. Take a holistic view of the employee journey\n\nTo create an accurate employee experience journey map, HR should see the\njourney from a holistic perspective.\n\n\"The goal in creating an employee journey map is to [break down the\nsilos](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/feature/Breaking-down-data-\nsilos-with-strong-data-governance) that might be standing in the way of an\nintegrated experience,\" said Kelly Ann Doherty, chief people and\ncommunications officer at Mr. Cooper Group, an online home mortgage company.\n\"Your employees don't think about every interaction they have with the company\nin those silos, so it's critical to think about the entire journey and how\neach group plays a role in the overall experience.\"\n\nFor example, IT can have a big impact on a new employee's first day, and the\nonboarding and training experience HR offers can influence someone's sense of\nbelonging. From employees' perspective, their workplace journeys are not only\ntheir specific jobs. Instead, companies need to include programs and\ninitiatives, such as benefits programs, workplace technology, corporate\ncommunications, development and recognition programs, and team celebrations.\n\n\"Each individual piece feeds a greater singular experience,\" Doherty said.\n\nAs part of this, it's important to look for the moments that matter most.\n\n\"As you build your journey map, look for opportunities to create peak\nmoments,\" Doherty said. \"It could be a program, perk, giveaway or experience\nthat's memorable and unique to your company, and those peak moments\ndifferentiate you as an employer and delight your teams.\"\n\n### __4\\. Reevaluate touchpoints over time\n\nAn effective employee experience journey map flows from employees' first\nencounter with a job opening through to their alumni status.\n\n\"For us, the employee journey provides a framework for viewing the employee\nexperience through a [long-term\nlens](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/10-ingredients-in-a-\nkiller-employee-experience-strategy),\" said Julie Meyer, director of talent\nmanagement at West Monroe Partners, a management consulting firm. \"Instead of\nthinking about an individual employee's experience as a 12-month sprint from\none annual review to the next, the employee journey reframes it as a\ncontinuous journey.\"\n\nTouchpoints will change, rise and wane in importance throughout the span of\nthe journey. They can rarely be captured in a frozen snapshot.\n\n\"To create an effective experience map, business owners and entrepreneurs\nshould realize that an annual or biannual engagement survey is nowhere near\neffective, and they should transition into a by experience- or lifecycle-style\ninstead,\" said Liz Brown, founder of Sleeping Lucid, a sleeping product review\nand testing service.\n\nFocusing on moments that matter helps ensure that results are accurate, up to\ndate and personalized according to roles, she said.\n\n\"Simply put, an employee journey mapping can only be effective if it's\nspecific, personalized and up to date,\" Brown said.\n\n### __5\\. Understand the employee experience extends beyond work hours\n\nToday's employees see their work experiences as part of their overall life\nexperience. By viewing the totality of a seamless experience, HR teams can\ngain important insights into what employees truly want and what might motivate\nthem to stay with the company.\n\n\"In today's tight labor market, employees, especially millennials, want a\nworkplace with a strong culture, one that values and supports them and is an\nextension of their social lives,\" said Jagoda Wieczorek, HR manager at\nResumeLab, an online resume creation tool. \"Experience is what matters to them\nmost, while compensation and benefits are just table stakes in attracting and\nretaining the best employees.\"\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on Employee engagement and recognition software\n\n  * [\n\n##### How to create an employee journey map\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/meltzer_rachel.jpg) By: Rachel\nMeltzer ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/How-to-create-an-\nemployee-journey-map)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Clarity key to Southwest Airlines smooth candidate experience\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/daniel_diann.jpg) By: Diann\nDaniel ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Clarity-key-to-\nSouthwest-Airlines-smooth-candidate-experience)\n\n  * [\n\n##### 8 HR technology trends CHROs should investigate in 2020\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/marson_luke.jpg) By: Luke\nMarson ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/8-HR-technology-trends-\nCHROs-should-investigate-in-2020)\n\n  * [\n\n##### 6 candidate journey mapping secrets savvy recruiters know\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/baker_pam.jpg) By: Pam Baker\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/6-candidate-journey-mapping-\nsecrets-savvy-recruiters-HR-pros-know)\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [How IT and HR can Partner to Deliver a Better Employee Experience](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/How-IT-and-HR-can-Partner-to-Deliver-a-Better-Employee-Experience) -Citrix\n  * [The Next-Generation Workspace: Removing Barriers and Frustration](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/The-Next-Generation-Workspace-Removing-Barriers-and-Frustration) -Citrix\n  * [Want Engaged and Inspired Employees?

Bersin](https://hrexecutive.com/author/josh-bersin/ \"Posts by Josh\nBersin\") | January 29, 2020 \u2022 3 min read\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/themes/riskandinsurance/avatars/468.png)\n\nJosh Bersin writes _HRE_ \u2019s HR in the Flow of Work column. Bersin is an\nanalyst, author, educator and thought leader focusing on the global talent\nmarket and the challenges and trends impacting business workforces around the\nworld. He recently spoke at the [HR Technology Conference in Las\nVegas](https://www.hrtechnologyconference.com/). He can be emailed at\nhreletters@lrp.com.\n\nTopics: [Benefits and\nCompensation](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/) |\n[Career Development](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/career-\ndevelopment-talentmanagement/) |\n[Columnists](https://hrexecutive.com/category/columnists/) |\n[Compensation](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/compensation-\nbenefitsandcompensation/) | [Employee\nRecognition](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/employee-\nrecognition/) | [HR\nLeadership](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrleadership/) | [HR\nTechnology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [HR Technology\nConference News](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-technology-\nconference/) | [Talent\nManagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/)\n\nToday\u2019s organizations are very interconnected. People work in a more agile\nfashion (though not necessarily in the [agile](https://hrexecutive.com/agile-\norganizations-need-leadership-not-management/) methodology), they lend a hand\nto other projects and teams, and their managers are less involved in their\nday-to- day activities.\n\n[Edgar Schein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Schein), former professor\nfor the MIT Sloan School of Management, once told me that the most valuable\ncultural asset for any company is the desire of employees to help each other.\nTherefore, we should be thinking about how we motivate and recognize people\nwho demonstrate this behavior.\n\nThe [traditional performance process](https://joshbersin.com/2018/11/we-\nwasted-ten-years-talking-about-performance-ratings-the-seven-things-weve-\nlearned/) is based on _individual_ achievements. However, research now shows\nthat the highest-performing companies reward people for team goals, not just\nindividual goals. Yet, fewer than one-third of companies do this.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n**See also:[How to bring out the best in teams](https://hrexecutive.com/how-\nto-bring-out-the-best-in-your-teams/)**\n\nMost performance-management processes are also riddled with other problems.\n[Mercer\u2019s 2019 Global Performance Management Study\n](https://www.mercer.us/our-thinking/career/global-performance-management-\nstudy-2019.html) found that only 2% of leaders believe their performance\nprocess delivers high value, only a half have goals at the business-unit level\nand fewer than 3% believe they have excellent feedback practices. The study\nalso found that only 30% of companies rate managers on their people-leadership\ncapabilities, and only 9% reward managers based on their ability to lead\npeople.\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Performance-\nManagement.1.28.20-700x394.png)\n\nAs I learned during my seven years at Deloitte, the success of the\norganization is based on alignment, continuous feedback, trust and\naccountability. The Mercer study clearly points out that pay-for-performance\nis on the rise, and the top driver of success is a sense of fairness and\ntransparency in pay.\n\nI\u2019m seeing performance management again taking center stage, but this time\nit\u2019s all about sound goal setting, clear expectations, focus, feedback, growth\nand a fair, equitable and well-designed way of rewarding people. Additionally,\nthe HR-driven employee-performance process must be directly linked to business\ngoals.\n\nWhat do we do about pay? It\u2019s still very important, but in today\u2019s world, we\nhave to review it more often, adjust it based on market changes, and create\ntotal transparency in the process. I recently talked with an executive whose\ncompany does quarterly pay reviews for all major roles, and employees receive\ncost-of-living adjustments at least once per year. Patagonia aligns raises in\nbase pay for an individual\u2019s in-the-job performance and then pays high bonuses\nfor beyond-the-job contributions. Pay is an area with many opportunities to\ninnovate.\n\n**[CLICK HERE](https://hrexecutive.com/author/josh-bersin/) for more columns\nfrom Josh Bersin**\n\nFinally, the research points out that career growth is key to performance and\nrewards. The best reward for any ambitious person is a promotion. That may not\nmean a higher-level job, but it does mean a new, exciting, expanded role.\nCreating a talent network for career growth is key to the future of work.\n\nAs you think about your priorities for the year ahead, I strongly advise you\nto revisit the performance and pay practices in your company. I\u2019m just\nfinishing up a report on the management of technology workers. Our research\nfound that empowerment, clear goals, pay-for-performance and transparency are\nall key to high performance. In a sense, tech workers are the \u201ccanaries in the\ncoal mine,\u201d teaching us what everyone needs to perform better in this new\nworld.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nLet me conclude with an interesting observation from the Mercer research. The\nauthors claim, \u201cManagers, as we know them, will cease to exist and AI will\nplay a bigger their role.\u201d While I think this prediction is a bit over the\ntop, there is some truth to the statement. One of the biggest challenges I run\ninto as I visit HR teams around the world is the realignment and development\nof leaders to meet the management requirements of today. In this new world,\nleadership is not about setting goals and holding people accountable. I\u2019d\nargue that\u2019s the simplest part of the job. The primary responsibilities are\nlistening, coaching, advising, connecting and serving as the career stewards\nfor the people around you.\n\nTake a good look at your leadership model in the year ahead, and don\u2019t be in\nthe 91% of companies who don\u2019t reward leaders for the real role they play.\nEveryone is a leader in the future of work, and it is important in the year\nahead that we redefine what leaders do.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fperformance-\nand-rewards-in-the-future-of-work%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Josh+Bersin%3A+Performance+and+rewards+in+the+future+of+work&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fperformance-\nand-rewards-in-the-future-of-work%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fperformance-\nand-rewards-in-the-future-of-work%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Recognizing the impact of \u201cleaking tap\u201d HR issues, Curo\nand QCG have combined forces to help U.K. mid-sized companies across\nindustries to identify the root of the problem and eliminate them.  \n\nWhile the size and scope of challenges vary from organization to organization,\ntogether, Curo and QCG will cover everything from an inefficient, time-\nconsuming compensation review process to a lack of HR resources needed to\nexecute a successful compensation strategy. Curo and QCG will also account for\nunresolved pain points such as the absence of a proper employee value\nproposition contributing to high employee turnover as well as an inability to\nenforce governance over the company as a whole.\n\nRogerio Albelo, Head of Alliances for Curo, commented, \u201cWith \u2018leaking tap\u2019\nissues, the problems often go unnoticed, costing the organizations significant\namounts of money in the process. Over time, the severity increases,\ninfluencing HR\u2019s ability to function and putting the organization at risk.\nWith QCG Consulting, Curo is helping to find the source of the \u2018leak,\u2019 prevent\nadditional fallout and shore up the organization\u2019s foundation.\u201d\n\nDelivering a combined offering, Curo and QCG will work to automate the reward\nprocess and implement the tools needed to facilitate governance; ensure reward\nbudget spend is under control and correctly allocated; mitigate the amount of\nrisk in reward by managing compliance; and communicate to employees about the\nfair, equitable and transparent reward strategy in place.\n\nAlan Hurst, Managing Director for QCG Consulting, shared, \u201cFor nearly 20\nyears, QCG has taken a pragmatic approach to HR, with a strong track record of\nhelping clients align their strategies and systems and improve overall\neffectiveness. Partnering with Curo, we\u2019ll continue that mission, focusing on\nstrengthening compensation and reward programs and ensuring organizations\nclose up any existing gaps and maximize their efforts.\u201d\n\nFor more information about Curo and the company\u2019s global partners, visit\n[_https://www.curocomp.com/global-partners_](https://www.curocomp.com/global-\npartners).\n\n**About Curo Compensation Limited |[\n_www.curocomp.com_](http://www.curocomp.com/)**  \nCuro is a market leading provider of compensation management software.

The projection for 2020 is holding steady at 2.2 percent.  \n\n  * For employees receiving promotional increases, the size of the average base pay increase rose to 8.9 percent, up from 8.7 percent a year earlier.\n\n\"Companies need to recognize that while the salary budget increases are\nrelatively modest, in the current work landscape salaries are just one\ncomponent in a compensation package,\" said Alison Avalos, director at\nWorldatWork. \"Other [recent research](https://www.worldatwork.org/press-\nroom/the-current-state-of-pto-and-paid-parental-leave-programs-in-the-u-s)\nindicates that beyond salary, total rewards benefits that provide a great work\nexperience and a great life experience are valued highly by employees, and\ncompanies are addressing these needs to remain competitive.\"  \n\nSalary.com, which provides compensation data and analytics, similarly projects\nthat salary-increase budgets [will again see median growth of 3 percent in\n2020](https://www.salary.com/news-and-events/2019-2020-national-salary-budget-\nsurvey-three-percent-ninth-straight-year/) in all employee categories.

Some employers are also recognizing the contributions of these\nemployees with better annual incentives and discretionary bonuses.\"  \n\nIn its survey, Mercer found that:  \n\n  * A small portion of employers, 14 percent in 2019, do not use performance ratings. Of those, the majority distribute merit pay based on manager discretion with oversight/review by business leader or HR/compensation group.  \n\n  * **Organizations continue to differentiate base pay by performance.** The majority (90 percent) still use individual performance to drive base salary adjustments, up from 2018 (88 percent). In 2019, high performers received 1.6 times **** the salary increase of average performers.  \n\n##  Focus on Variable Pay\n\nAs annual budgets for salary increases have not significantly increased year\nover year, organizations are directing more of their compensation budgets to\nvariable pay programs. \"In looking to reward and retain top talent,\norganizations that leverage performance-based variable pay programs hold a\ncompetitive advantage,\" Fusco said.  \n\nSalary.com's survey had the following results:  \n\n______________  \n\n**Variable Pay in the U.S. as a Percentage of Base Pay**\n\n**Employee Category**|  **Planned 2020 Mean**|  **Planned 2020 Median**|\n**Actual 2019 Mean**|  **Actual 2019 Median**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nExecutives| 39.0%| 35.0%| 39.4%| 34.0%  \nOther managers| 17.9%| 15.0%| 16.8%| 15.0%  \nExempt employees| 12.5%| 10.0%| 11.9%| 9.0%  \nNonexempt employees| 7.9%| 5.0%|  6.9%|  5.0%  \n  \nSource: Salary.com 2019-2020 U.S. and Canada National Salary Budget Survey.\n\nWillis Towers Watson's survey found the following:  \n\n______________  \n\n**Short-Term Incentive/Bonus as a Percentage of Base Pay  \n**\n\n**Employee Category**|  **Projected 2020 Mean**|  **Projected 2020 Median**|\n**Budgeted 2019 Mean**|  **Budgeted 2019 Median**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nExecutives| 48.8%| 45.0%| 48.4%| 45.0%  \nManagement, excluding executives  \n| 20.4%| 18.0%| 21.0%| 18.0%  \nExempt, nonmanagement  \n| 10.8%| 10.0%| 11.0%| 10.0%  \nNonexempt salaried  \n| 6.3%| 5.0%|  6.4%|  5.2%  \nNonexempt hourly  \n| 5.7%| 5.0%|  5.8%|  5.0%  \nSource: Willis Towers Watson, 2019 General Industry Salary Budget Survey\u2014U.S.\n\nA base pay increase in the 2.8 percent to 3.1 percent range \"[is no way to\nreward your best and brightest employees](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/compensation/pages/continuous-evaluation-and-variable-pay-transform-\ncompany-cultures.aspx),\" said pay consultant John Rubino, SHRM-SCP, founder\nand president of Rubino Consulting Services, at the Society for Human Resource\nManagement 2019 Annual Conference & Exposition in June.\n\nWorldatWork found that 84 percent of surveyed organizations used variable pay\nas part of their compensation program in 2019.

In San Francisco, for instance, compensation grew by 4.5\npercent year over year, and in Milwaukee by 3.5 percent, the index showed. But\nin Pittsburgh and Cleveland the increases were just 0.8 percent and 0.7\npercent, respectively.  \n  \n\n**Ninth Year in a Row that Salary Growth Has Stayed Consistent**\n\nPay consultancy Korn Ferry also weighed in with a 2020 salary increase\nforecast in mid-September, striking many of the same chords as other 2020 pay\nprojections.\n\nFor the ninth year in a row [U.S. employees can expect to see a 3.0 percent\nmedian base salary increase in 2020](https://www.kornferry.com/press/same-ol-\nsame-ol), based on data from Korn Ferry's U.S. pay database, collected from\nMarch through June 2019.\n\nWhile the 3.0 percent anticipated median growth in base salaries is consistent\nacross employee groups from clerical support to executives, there are\nvariations in pay increase practices across organizations. Companies in the\ntop 10th percentile of surveyed organizations estimate a 3.5 percent increase\nacross employee groups in 2020, while the organizations that pay in the bottom\n10th percentile predict a 2.5 percent increase, according to the firm's\nanalysis.\n\n\"Even though the U.S. economy remains strong and we are experiencing very low\nunemployment levels, there are mixed views on anticipated economic growth,\nwhich has an impact on wage growth,\" said Korn Ferry Senior Client Partner Tom\nMcMullen. \"One factor may be that feelings of uncertainty about the future are\nkeeping employers cautious in terms of offering higher growth in fixed costs\nand base wages,\" he noted.  \n\n\"While the 3.0 percent median salary increase number has become typical over\nthe years, that doesn't mean that top performers aren't being rewarded,\" added\nMcMullen. \"Companies are relying more on short and long-term incentive plans\nand pay-for-performance programs to provide meaningful pay differentiation for\ntop talent.

Often enough, the phrase human\nresource management system (HRMS) is thrown into the alphabet soup as well.\nThis is a classic case of oversimplification leading to complications. These\nare not exactly the same things, though they deal with the cornerstone of\nevery organization \u2013 people. HRIS and HCM are both systematic approaches to\nmanage people better and to leverage the human potential of every\norganization. That said, their internal systems and processes have certain\ncardinal differences that cannot be overlooked._**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834b324a1a1.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n  * **What Is an HRIS?**\n  * **What Is HCM?**\n  * **HRIS vs. HCM: What's the Difference?**\n\n## **What Is an HRIS?**\n\n[Human resource information system\n(HRIS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/) can be defined as a software or online solution that is\nused for data entry, data tracking, and the data management of all human\nresources operations of an organization. An HRIS thus deals with all things\ndata and helps translate that to on-demand information and insights.\n\nThe six key HRIS systems and working components that most solutions offer are\nas follows:\n\n  * Database management\n  * Time and labor management\n  * Payroll functions\n  * Benefits management\n  * Employee interface\n  * Talent acquisition and retention\n\n  \n**Learn More:[What Is HRIS? System, Model, and\nApplication](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)**\n\n## **What Is HCM?**\n\nHuman capital management (HCM) is defined as a set of practices for human\nresource management with the goal of achieving organizational competency by\nfocusing on workforce acquisition, management, and optimization.\n\nToday, there are multiple HCM point and suite solutions available in a rather\ncrowded market. For example, multi-feature suite offerings by Workday, SAP,\nOracle, PeopleSoft, BambooHR, Zoho People and many other players offer a wide\nvariety of solutions.\n\nThe three pillars of human capital management are:\n\n### **1\\. Talent acquisition**\n\n  * Recruitment / eRecruitment\n  * ATS (application tracking system)\n  * Onboarding\n\n### **2\\. Talent management**\n\n  * Time and attendance\n  * Payroll\n  * Performance management\n  * Culture-building\n\n### **3\\.

Definition, Process and\nStrategy](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-human-capital-management/)**\n\n## **HRIS vs. HCM: What\u2019s the Difference?**\n\nThe primary difference between and HRIS and HCM suite solutions is that the\nHCM suite usually includes all the HRIS processes and systems under its\numbrella.\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 1. Comparing HRIS, HCM, and HRMS_**\n\n### **Does HCM have a wider scope?**\n\n  \nAs the figure below depicts, an HCM suite not only takes care of all HRIS sub-\nprocesses but also manages onboarding functions, **[performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)** , position mapping, and succession\nplanning, salary/compensation benchmarking, global connectivity, compliance\n(for geographically spread out organizations), and HR analytics.\n\nTo provide you with a holistic picture, we\u2019ve also included a depiction of\nwhere HRMS fits into the picture, or rather how HCM and HRIS both fit under\nthe broader umbrella of HRMS.\n\nMost HCM suites today are trying to incorporate payroll and labor management\nwithin their functionality and thus expanding their span of control to include\nHRMS offerings.\n\nWhat needs to be kept in mind while navigating this HR solutions market,\nespecially in an age of digital and data dependency, is that there are quite a\nfew talent management (TM) point solution vendors who often dub themselves HCM\nvendors to elevate their brand and to expand their clientele.\n\nWhether you choose an HRIS or an HCM suite depends on the talent management\ncapabilities you require and the extra functionalities that your people\nfunctions will benefit from. Moreover, time- and labor-centric point solutions\noften market their offerings as workforce management, but that is not the same\nas talent management.\n\n![HRIS Vs. HCM Vs. HRMS](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **Core features and capabilities**\n\n  \nThe core capabilities of HRIS and HCM solutions differ significantly. While an\nHRIS helps with recruiting, leave management, workflows, training, and\ndevelopment, benefits administration, self-service portals, compensation\nmanagement, and personnel tracking, there are often organizational needs that\ngo beyond the acquisition and management of data.\n\nCore HCM offerings, on the other hand, include all HRIS features along with\ntracking employee performance, [onboarding\nprocesses](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/), analytics (from all HRIS data)\nand workforce planning with regard to mapping the talent path ahead.\n\n**Learn More:[What is People Management?

That, followed by\nanalyzing your unique organizational needs, takes you closer to making the\nright choice. While choosing any HR software solution, keeping the following\nquestions in mind always help:\n\n  * What is my current and projected employee strength?\n  * What are the issues we face with our present HR processes or HR software?\n  * Where are the process gaps?\n  * How well are my employees equipped to adapt to a new or upgraded system?\n  * What are the limitations with regard to hosting all our existing data on the new system?\n  * How flexible is it and how easily can we upgrade or migrate to something different in the future?\n  * What are the potential challenges that we could face?\n  * What are the must-have, good-to-have, and great-to-have features based on our needs?\n\n  \n**Learn More:** **[Talent Acquisition Specialist: 10 Key Skill Requirements\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-specialist-key-skill-requirements/)**\n\nChoosing the right HR software is an important decision since every piece of\ndata helps you solve the larger people puzzle. Whether you go ahead with an\nHRIS or an HCM, your decision should be based on careful scrutiny of the\npresent scenario and your growth plans.\n\n_Do you use an HRIS or an HCM suite?

_Senior leaders and HR managers at Amazon choose PayScale\u2019s compensation\nmanagement solution to determine the right pay for the company\u2019s employees in\nminutes_\n\nSEATTLE, Feb. 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [_PayScale,\nInc_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GD9rLKb_YhR603Ojz-\nRzW5_IzY1KasR5VDRKZTfpuSP4E3oOFYCg5nbAgVayjzFVFIq0o-bik1fQ9YyQeqA7jg==)., the\nleader in modern compensation data and software, today announced that Amazon\nselected [_PayScale\u2019s\nMarketPay_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GD9rLKb_YhR603Ojz-\nRzW_9etuC5L_J7a7QZ2_QtX4Kvw0Ds3-RcNkJ_sg8cBXG5N9eVwFSnkyyHIbcnW3tHupmP2zBDjwZutQ3eG9sSvblbCjRv6rShdlIvY6ARimhD)\ncompensation survey management solution to determine the right pay in less\ntime for the company\u2019s massive workforce. Managing compensation at Amazon is\nan incredible undertaking, as the company often hires hundreds of employees\neach day across an exceptionally diverse set of positions ranging from data\nscientists to movie directors and warehouse managers. Amazon selected\nPayScale\u2019s automated compensation analytics to dramatically reduce the time\nrequired to set pay for positions across thousands of jobs in Amazon\u2019s various\ngeographies.\n\n\u201cAs the definitive market leader across a number of industries, Amazon\nunderstands that its people are the company\u2019s most important competitive\ndifferentiator. However, getting pay right at this immense and continually\nexpanding company is extraordinarily complex,\u201d said Scott Torrey, PayScale\nCEO. \u201cAmazon hired tens of thousands of people over the past two years and the\ncompany is poised to continue this growth into the future. We are excited to\nwork with Amazon to support their recruitment and retention efforts and,\nultimately, to ensure the company gets the most return from its compensation\ninvestments.\u201d\n\nAmazon will use PayScale\u2019s MarketPay solution to analyze data from 125\ncompensation surveys and benchmark pay for positions across the company in a\nmatter of minutes rather than months. MarketPay\u2019s powerful data analytics\nautomates the time-consuming process of pricing talent associated with\ntraditional compensation surveys, allowing HR managers and other senior\nleaders to set the right pay quickly and easily. In addition, HR managers have\nincreased confidence in their pay decisions using MarketPay\u2019s highly visual\nreporting tools which show the right pay more clearly than interpreting data\nin a spreadsheet. Amazon\u2019s managers can also use PayScale\u2019s new Differentials\nEngine, a set of analytics designed to simplify the process of applying\nspecific skills or geographic data which is essential for accurately pricing\ntalent. Using PayScale, Amazon can more easily determine pay to recruit more\ngreat employees and ensure they keep the exceptional employees they already\nhave in their workforce.\n\nFor more information about PayScale and the MarketPay compensation survey\nmanagement solution, please visit:\n[_https://www.payscale.com/hr/marketpay_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bjjYlYHdMARpfLu6M6lx5WkpvsyQt64ucOjOqqKBiYwfJGlYEINaB4kFM2gdtNHkPipbjYEy7WZ3zmhUM3B7C2GoTKx5xf4Lvi0X6xlFk46ulgmh8kn-\nYZIHqGGS4Hp-)\n\n **About PayScale:**  \nPayScale offers modern compensation software and the most precise, real-time,\ndata-driven insights for employees and employers alike.

Employees who perceive bias in their\nworkplace are three times as likely to leave their current job, according to a\n2017 Center for Talent Innovation study.\n\nUsing AI can be the key to eliminating bias and recruiting talent, says Tanya\nJansen, chief marketing officer and co-founder of beqom, a cloud-based\ncompensation provider. But companies struggle with not having a centralized,\nautomated way to manage compensation.\n\n\u201cAs a result, compensation decisions are being made without any kind of\nlogical approach, which leads to bias and potential unfairness in how\ndifferent employees are treated,\u201d she says. \u201cThe more companies can leverage\ntechnology to automate that process, the more they can remove any bias that\u2019s\ngoing to creep in because of other aspects that are uncontrolled.\n\nJensen spoke with _Employee Benefit News_ about the steps that can be taken to\nprevent these biases.\n\n **What issues do you see in the workplace today in terms of bias?**  \nWhen things [like compensation] are not being automated and when you're not\nbringing in enough data to make the right decision, you're by default leaving\nroom for error. You're giving the manager decision-making capabilities that\nare not necessarily controlled and as a result, you're going to have unfair\npractices, whether they realize it or not.\n\n[When employers are] not making decisions based on data, they're making\ndecisions based on how they feel, and that's what we're trying to remove.\nWhether they know it or not, there's still some type of a bias that's going\ninto the decision making process as long as you leave it completely\nsubjective.\n\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2d9753f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/512x512+0+0/resize/840x840!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2F37%2F69%2F2d68b7d14f7f8df9af5897453317%2Ftanya-\njansen-beqom.jpg)\n\nTanya Jansen, co-founder of cloud-based compensation provider beqom.\n\n**How can employers use technology like AI for compensation practices?**  \nThere's a lot of assets and data \u2014 years with the company, level of education\nand performance etc. \u2014 that goes into deciding why [employees] should get a\ncertain amount of [pay]. If you put all these factors together, [it makes it\neasier for] the human brain to comprehend all that information, so that's\nwhere technology comes into play. AI is using the data to make proposals for\nthings like how compensation structures should evolve in the future, and is\nremoving any type of bias that may [have] resulted in unfair or unequal pay.\n\nIn a highly competitive industry where [companies] have very highly paid\nindividuals that are highly performing, there's a big risk they could lose\n[employees] to their competitors, which is a high cost on them. [Employers]\ncan use AI in order to predict that and understand what areas where they might\nhave retention risks. So anywhere they see that employees could potentially be\na flight risk, [technology can help them] understand how to leverage\ncompensation in order to better keep those individuals from leaving their firm\nand going to the competitor.\n\n**Why is it important for employers to address bias?**  \nBecause their employees care. Employees are [increasingly] putting pressure on\ntheir organizations to prove that [employers are] taking measures to treat\nthem fairly \u2014 related to compensation, promotion or other various different\naspects \u2014 in the workforce.\n\nThere's always going to be bias unless you're providing your employees with\nfull transparency on why a decision was made, why they're being paid this, how\nit's linked to performance, how it relates to their overall total reward\npackage. The more awareness that's being put on the topic of pay equality and\nremoving decision-making bias, the more employers are going to have to prove\nthat they're taking the right steps to address that in order to better retain\ntheir people.\n\nBy looking at areas where there's been high turnover in the past, and\npredicting where there might be manager bias, [employers] can prevent [it from\nhappening] in the future. That can allow them to take preventative action on\nthings like turnover, low performance and any other things that might\nnegatively impact the organization.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f758882/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2701x2701+0+214/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2Fb0%2Fe2%2Fab2bfa424c60847d81a86ca802c2%2Fimage-\nfrom-ios-1.jpg)

workers ranks as the toughest challenge HR\nfaces in the coming year, according to a new survey.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | December

leaders, sourcing and landing\nhigh-quality applicants, along with managing future healthcare (especially the\nAffordable Care Act) and diversity, are predicted to be HR\u2019s toughest\nchallenges during the coming year, according to a survey of more than 700 HR\nprofessionals.\n\nThe [survey](https://www.xperthr.com/forms/top-HR-trends-\nfor-2020-strategic/?DMDcode=HUXXC&fcid=%7b5f331420-ea59-4cab-a989-1f0b8bfeb5a8%7d_FC0218_XHR_201912_Top_HR_Trends_for_2020&fcfileext=pdf&title=Top%20HR%20Trends%20for%202020&cmpid=PRL|USAG|HUGMN-2019-2019-Press_Releases&sfid=7014J000000Q0Aw),\nXpertHR\u2019s fourth annual, reports that nearly 30% of respondents named\nrecruiting and hiring as their most critical challenge. Most of all, of those\nwho reported recruiting and hiring needs, 51% are \u201cextremely challenged\u201d in\nfinding high-quality candidates\u2014more than twice the number (22%) from just two\nyears ago.\n\n\u201cFinding skilled, qualified applicants is a struggle for many,\u201d says Beth\nZoller, JD, legal editor at XpertHR. She adds that building a culture where\nemployees want to work; seeking out untapped job markets such as [older\nemployees](https://hrexecutive.com/why-older-workers-are-now-in-demand/),\n[veterans](https://hrexecutive.com/partnership-aims-to-help-vets-succeed-in-\ntheir-next-mission/) and[ those with criminal\nconvictions](https://hrexecutive.com/how-companies-are-putting-ex-offenders-\nback-to-work/); and taking advantage of non-traditional candidates (for\ninstance, gig workers, remote workers and job shares) might be a few\nsolutions.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n\u201cThese are all tactics that employers can implement in order to meet their\ntalent-acquisition needs,\u201d Zoller says.\n\nAs for healthcare, 50% of respondents are feeling [\u201cextremely challenged\u201d by\ncosts](https://hrexecutive.com/study-americans-are-agonizing-over-healthcare-\ncosts/), while 27% are extremely challenged when it comes to preparing for the\nfuture of healthcare and the ACA. In fact, compared with prior years, concern\nover the future of healthcare and the ACA has grown considerably\u2014only 17%\nfound this a top concern in 2017.\n\n**Related:[These were the top 5 benefits trends of\n2019](https://hrexecutive.com/kathryn-mayer-top-5-benefit-trends-of-2019/)**\n\n\u201cIn addition to the rising cost of benefits, employers must address the needs\nof different generations and provide benefits that each group finds useful,\u201d\nZoller explains. For example, she says,[ older\nworkers](https://hrexecutive.com/how-to-keep-baby-boomer-workers-happy/) may\nbe more interested in long-term disability, while younger workers may want\nbenefits such as [daycare](https://hrexecutive.com/bring-your-baby-to-work-no-\nreally/) and gym memberships.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s employers need to strike a balance and determine which benefits are\nmost valuable and attractive to their workforce,\u201d Zoller says.\n\nNext up on the difficulty scale is diversity and inclusion. Zoller says this\nissue today goes beyond race, sex, ethnicity, age, national origin and\nreligion, and includes differing work experiences, sexual orientation,\neducational status, marital status, socioeconomic status, physical\ncharacteristics, life experiences, background and upbringing. XpertHR\u2019s survey\nfound that 38% of respondents reported managing diversity to be extremely\nchallenging.\n\n**See also:[How the world's most admired companies drive diversity and\ninclusion](https://hrexecutive.com/how-the-worlds-most-admired-companies-\ndrive-diversity-and-inclusion/)**\n\nZoller believes it's incumbent upon HR to lead the way and incorporate\ndiversity into the organization, with the goal of creating an inclusive and\ntolerant workplace.\n\n\u201cDiversity efforts start at the top with the buy-in of key stakeholders and\nupper management who can see the value diversity can bring,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\nmust be tied to business goals and aligned with corporate strategies.\u201d\n\nOther strategic HR concerns survey respondents characterized as \u201cextremely\nchallenging\u201d include employee engagement, morale and satisfaction (34%),\nemployee retention (31%) and managing work/life balance (20%).\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

going to be a different game in 2020 and beyond.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | December 24, 2019 \u2022 5 min read\n\nTopics: [HR

updated technology products can\nbe mind-boggling for HR decision-makers.\n\nYet, among the potential confusion, one thing is clear, according to experts:\nPurchasing HR-tech software today requires a fresh perspective, as the old\nways no longer work\u2014for a variety of reasons.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem we see in the market is people just are just going in and\nsaying, \u2018Let\u2019s find a new HR system,\u2019 but things have changed so much,\u201d says\nVinnie Mirchandani, founder of Deal Architect and a longtime thought leader on\ntrends in software, outsourcing and offshoring, who\u2014along with industry expert\nBrian Sommer\u2014will deliver the closing keynote address at [Select HR\nTech](http://www.selecthrtech.com), set for June 9-11 in Las Vegas. \u201cIt\u2019s much\nbetter for HR decision-makers to look at something like recruiting, for\ninstance, as a stream, as a process.\u201d\n\nNext, he says, take a hard look at the tools available today that can help\ncompletely reimagine the recruiting process.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the art of what\u2019s possible; don\u2019t just jump in and do what you\ndid the last time,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhen it comes to reimagining HR processes\u2014not\njust recruiting, but all of them\u2014you, of course, have to factor in human\nskills, but you have to factor in machine skills, too.\u201d\n\n**Cloud Delivery has Changed the Game**\n\nAccording to Karen Piercy, a partner at Mercer in the HR Effectiveness segment\nwithin the Talent business, as basic functionality becomes much more common\nacross technologies, the focus during software selection and purchasing is\nprimarily on user experience and the ability to meet specific business\nchallenges. As a result, vendor demonstrations are becoming longer, with\nscripted agendas and scenarios.\n\n\u201cEmployers are including more people in the decision-making process, and\nparticularly in the vendor demonstrations,\u201d Piercy says. \u201cReferences are\nimportant for companies to validate what they hear from vendors but also to\nmake connections with other organizations they can continue to contact during\nimplementation and beyond.\u201d\n\nPlus, she adds, it\u2019s no surprise that cloud technology has changed the entire\nlandscape. Mercer, in fact, comes across practically no organizations looking\nto purchase non-cloud solutions, and it\u2019s likely that very few vendors are\neven selling them at this point.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n\u201cThe drive to replace on-premise solutions continues full-\nthrottle\u2014particularly as organizations are seeing investments by vendors go to\ntheir new cloud products, rather than the on-premise versions,\u201d Piercy says.\n\nAbove it all, the emergence of artificial intelligence/machine learning is the\nmost exciting trend, she says, noting that Mercer has seen a spike in the past\nyear in AI-powered HR solutions, especially in the area of career development.\n\n\u201cThese new technologies can really help organizations provide targeted career\nsupport to employees through technology,\u201d she says. Such technologies can act\nas career coaches by sourcing feedback on competencies, recommending training\nprograms, identifying internal job opportunities, and showing career paths and\npotential next jobs to employees.\n\n\u201cThis is an area where HR can say they heard the request from employees and do\nit in a way that is affordable and scaleable,\u201d she says.\n\nMercer\u2019s Craig Johnson, a partner in the firm\u2019s Career Workforce Communication\nand Change group, adds that today\u2019s greater focus on employee experience means\ndecisions can\u2019t be made in a silo\u2014that is, without thinking about how\ndecisions impact the employee experience, something that had not been part of\nthe buying decision-making in the past.\n\n\u201cOnce you have an HR-technology strategy and roadmap, sharing that with the\nappropriate stakeholders at the appropriate time and in the appropriate way\nwill help you align leaders and eventually help you communicate the correct\nmessaging to all end users,\u201d Johnson says, adding that leadership alignment\nalso can help HR leaders each step of the way on their technology journey\u2014from\napproving budgets to championing messaging.\n\nLastly, training and education on using new technology helps with adoption,\nbut he warns that HR leaders must be sure to have a plan/approach for this.\nFor example, don\u2019t wait until a few weeks before the technology is going live\nfor communication and training.\n\n\u201cThink about your stakeholders and their specific needs and adjust/deliver\ncommunication and train in ways that align to those stakeholders,\u201d Johnson\nsays.\n\nChris Pinc, managing director of HR Software Product Management in the Talent\nand Rewards Business at Willis Towers Watson, says several shifts have changed\nfocus for software and HR technology. The first is the aforementioned move\nfrom on-premise to cloud-based software.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re buying is what you see today, plus all of the likely enhancements\nthat\u2019ll come over the coming years,\u201d he says. Pinc says truly understanding\nthe roadmap for a product and release cycle is critical, including g what\nenhancements will be forced upon HR buyers versus what kinds they can\nselect\u2014and versus what kinds they are going to have to pay extra to use.\n\n\u201cAll of that needs to be taken into consideration when buying today,\u201d he says.\n\nPinc says another new focus is the shift away from solely relying on desktop\ncapabilities to mobile, particularly for employee-facing platforms.\n\n\u201cPeople are much more on the go,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are growing up doing things\non mobile devices, and that trend has just been accelerating.\u201d\n\nPinc says he also sees a shift away from thinking about HR as the primary user\nto thinking about employees as the primary user, which means HR buyers have to\nkeep employee experience at the forefront, and consider how software will\nimpact it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really key in buying new technology is to think about areas of the HR\nspace where it makes more sense for employees to be doing things on their own\nversus where it still makes sense for HR to play a role,\u201d he says, noting the\nbroader impact of disintermediation happening today across the economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called taking out the middle man, and HR is not immune to that,\u201d he\nsays, comparing this trend to people who book their own travel or make a\ndinner reservation using technology, without having to ask someone else to do\nit.\n\n**Move Back to Best-of-Breed?**\n\nPinc predicts that the trend for the next five years, at least, is a move back\nto a system for core HR capabilities, with more of a focus on best-of-breed\ncapabilities for strategic pieces. He notes many core HR-system vendors are\ntrying to do too much, expanding very broadly. Integrated talent-management/HR\nsuites have consistently wrestled with how much to expand in recent years, in\nterms of how much ground to cover. At some point, Pinc says, they start to get\nperhaps too big, rendering their offerings not robust enough and prompting HR\nto pull back and refocus on best-of-breed choices.\n\n\u201cIt has been a real big movement in the past couple of years towards best-of-\nbreed capabilities to supplement core HR systems,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still really the early days, honestly,\u201d Pinc adds. He still sees many\norganizations trying to consolidate down to a single core HR system and then\nmove to the cloud, or move off of outdated performance- and compensation-\nmanagement processes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work that\u2019s still happening in Excel spreadsheets that\nreally should be done through compensation planning or compensation-analysis\nfunctionality,\u201d Pinc says. \u201cThat\u2019s going to change, but it will take time.\u201d\n\n**Getting the Most Value for the Dollar**\n\nMirchandani says that, while HR should be leading on the topic of HR\ntechnology, too often many HR decision-makers aren\u2019t dealing with future tech\nchallenges, especially when it comes to return on investment.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think HR would be all over it saying, \u2018OK, how is every one of my\nemployees\u2019 jobs going to change?\u2019 But many of them are not thinking about it,\nhonestly,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re reacting to things more than proactively managing\nthings.\u201d\n\nMirchandani cites the HR-tech procurement process as an area that will\ncontinue to change, and notes HR leaders have a great chance to step up and\nensure they are getting the most for their investments. For example, the\nsystems integrator process has changed quite a bit due to the software as a\nservice world. As such, HR buyers are not so much concerned about software\nhosting or application management; rather, they are mainly looking at the\nimplementation aspect of buying new software.\n\n\u201cWith that, rethinking the procurement process must be factored into buying\ndecisions,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are now websites that are scoring systems\nintegrators, something that wasn\u2019t available in the last go-around.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nThat tougher scrutiny is forcing every systems integrator to certify its\nconsultants and costs. HR leaders must take advantage and make smarter, more\nefficient decisions, he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different set of checks and balances on the systems integrators that\nwe didn\u2019t have the last time major buying decisions were being made,\u201d he says.\n\u201cNow, the buying audience needs to know, \u2018Hey, the market is completely\ndifferent now.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWith the continuing trend to SaaS delivery, he explains, buyers should\nhopefully pay less with higher project-success rates. After all, HR buyers no\nlonger need to worry about disruptive upgrade hassles every couple of years\nbecause the SaaS process can more easily and smoothly do two to three\nreleases/upgrades annually.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to plan for those and decide what features to adopt in each\nrelease,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a new type of burden, but it\u2019s nothing\ncompared to how difficult the upgrades used to be.\u201d Mirchandani, in fact, once\ncalled the old HR-software upgrade process as risky as \u201crefueling in mid-air\u201d\nbecause shutting down a business for upgrades could go seriously wrong.\n\nHR-tech buyers today, he says, should look at what they spent on their\ninternal staff and integrators on the last wave and see how they can maximize\ntheir ROI.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t see too many companies asking, \u2018Why am I paying the\nsame amount again?\u2019 Or, \u2018Why am I paying even more now?\u2019 \u201d he says, adding\nthat HR should dictate the terms and expect to see some efficiencies over the\ncourse of a five-year contract.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think HR buyers have been demanding enough in terms of the payback\nfrom SaaS. Clearly, they benefited from it, but I don\u2019t see the dollar value\nshowing up yet,\u201d Mirchandani says. \u201cThat needs to change as we move into this\nnew world of HR-technology shopping.\u201d\n\n**(Note: Vinnie Mirchandani will team with HR-tech industry expert Brian\nSommer, founder and president of TechVentive, to deliver the closing keynote\naddress, \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Past Dictate Your HR Tech Future,\u201d at**[ **Select HR\nTech**](https://www.selecthrtech.com) **.

In this article, the authors draw from interviews\nwith directors of family businesses to offer advice on navigating these sticky\nsubjects with grace and sensitivity.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/01/Jan20_23_159998602.jpg) Doug\nArmand/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/01/managing-the-trickiest-parts-of-a-family-\nbusinesses?language=es)\n\nServing on any board of directors is hard, but in a family-owned business,\nit\u2019s even harder. Unlike their public-company counterparts, which focus mainly\non increasing shareholder value, family-business boards must act on behalf of\nstakeholders with multiple and potentially conflicting agendas \u2013 for example,\nco-owners with equal power and completely opposing financial timelines. And\nbecause interpersonal dynamics in family businesses are much more complicated,\ndiscussions of critical issues like leadership succession, compensation, and\nthe performance of management often become uncomfortable, messy, and\nemotionally fraught. It\u2019s not unusual for family directors to shy away from\nthem and, when they do, for the independent directors to follow their lead.\n\nYet accepting the notion that it\u2019s OK to have taboos \u2013 areas of conflict that\nboards hesitate to tackle \u2013 is bad for business. In our decades of working\nwith family-owned firms, one thing we have seen is that avoidance doesn\u2019t\nwork. It can seriously undermine the board\u2019s effectiveness, as it did at one\nglobal infrastructure company where a frustrated director told us: \u201cThe board\nis almost evaluating situations on a case-by-case basis rather than forming\nprocesses, procedures, and rules.\u201d\n\n#### Insight Center\n\n  * ###### [Leading a Family Business](/insight-center/leading-a-family-business)\n\nSponsored by Northern Trust\n\nBest practices for long-term success.\n\nLearning to move through these uncomfortable issues constructively is one of\nthe biggest challenges that boards of family businesses face. That came across\nclearly in a series of interviews we conducted with 19 external and family\nmember directors of major businesses in six countries in early 2019. Those\ndiscussions surfaced the most common taboos, as well as approaches for\naddressing them. They also highlighted, as one director described it, \u201cthe\nadditional interpersonal skills and courage to deal with the issues that the\nboard has to have.\u201d\n\n**CEO Succession**\n\nChoosing a successor to the CEO can be an extremely sensitive topic in a\nfamily business. The relative currently at the top may even be deeply\nresistant to the notion of being replaced \u2013 and vocal about it. Says one CEO\nof a listed company in South Asia: \u201cAs long as I\u2019m holding a large percentage\nof the company, I will ensure that the board will always remain \u2018my board\u2019\nthat stands by me in times of conflict\u2026This is a company that I have built\nwith my own sweat and hard work, and as long as I\u2019m active even my sons will\nbe subservient and do what I want.\u201d\n\nYet if a board abdicates its responsibility to address succession, it can lead\nto inappropriate leadership choices that threaten the business. The people we\nspoke with had some advice about how to encourage open and honest discussions\non the subject:\n\n**Build trust.** It\u2019s critical for directors to develop trust with one\nanother; the company\u2019s leadership, including both family and nonfamily\nmembers; and the broader shareholder group. But doing so is likely to take a\nlot longer than it would in a regular company because a direct approach\nfrequently doesn\u2019t work. Directors must learn to listen patiently and be\nempathetic about the family\u2019s dynamics, egos, and fears. \u201cOn a family board I\nneed to be thoughtful about how I put things across,\u201d says one India-based\ndirector. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I say that is important \u2013 it\u2019s how each family member\nwill perceive what I\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\nIn one U.S. business the directors, both family representatives and\nindependents, agreed that an outsider should succeed the CEO. But they had to\nmanage the expectations of multiple stakeholders, including family owners, a\nyoung and capable next-generation family member in management, and more-\nseasoned nonfamily executives. An outside CEO would be a first for the\ncompany, and the owners needed to feel confident it was the right choice. To\nensure their comfort, some directors suggested a completely external and\nunbiased evaluation of potential candidates, including the young family\nmember; others suggested that the family member be given special\nconsideration; others simply wanted her to feel included and valued; and still\nothers just wanted the best decision for the company. The board nodded to all\nthese viewpoints in designing a succession process, which ended up being\nlengthier and less efficient, but helped deepen trust.\n\nDirectors at another company came up with a unique but effective trust-\nbuilding tactic: They organized a retreat at a vacation spot where much of the\nfamily owned homes \u2013 which allowed them to get to know other directors better\n_and_ to develop ties with family members beyond the boardroom. When trouble\nlater emerged at the company, the directors already were at ease with one\nanother and were able to communicate clearly with the family.\n\n**Assess independently.** It\u2019s crucial to avoid any hint of bias in the\nselection process; otherwise, firms may not get the best person for the job\nand the new CEO may be seen as a weak leader chosen out of favoritism. Yet\nit\u2019s difficult for people inside the company to be completely objective; even\nHR managers may be viewed as being swayed by the family, especially if they\nreport to a family executive.\n\nTo get an unbiased perspective and a view of comparable external market\ntalent, some firms task a subset of directors to manage succession, recusing\nthose who have close family relationships with potential candidates. Other\nbusinesses lay the groundwork by having formal evaluations of all family\nexecutives conducted by an outside firm that reports to an independent\ndirector, rather than by the internal HR department.\n\n**Be transparent.**  Perhaps what differs most from nonfamily businesses is\nthe level of communication required. Every step in the succession process must\nbe carefully explained to make all feel that their needs have been considered.\n\n**Next-Generation Talent Development\n**\n\nFiguring out how to bring the next cohort of potential leaders in early enough\nto learn the business and gain the skills needed to run it is another major\nchallenge.\n\nIf directors don\u2019t tackle this, a lot can go wrong. Consider the quandary that\none South American company found itself in. The problem there was not that the\nnext generation wanted in \u2013 but that they wanted out. When two third-\ngeneration family members were offered executive roles, they declined, leaving\nthe business with no successors. \u201cThey see the business more as a source of\nwealth than a family legacy to develop,\u201d a director told us.\n\nHere are some suggestions for preparing young family members for roles in the\nbusiness:\n\n**Agree on the rules _before_ they\u2019re needed.** Next-generation talent\ndiscussions are much easier when they\u2019re theoretical, broad conversations\nrather than focused on elevating some relatives to leadership roles. In our\nexperience, it\u2019s best to set up norms for when and how the next generation\nwill enter the business, making sure that they emphasize capabilities and\neliminate biases and that young relatives understand them long before they\u2019re\nold enough to join the company.\n\nOne Italian firm we spoke with worked with the board on a formal family\ntalent-development plan when the founders were in their forties and fifties\nand the next generation were still young children; that discussion was\npurposely general, deemed  \u201cabout the future.\u201d The firm also created a family\ncouncil whose objectives were to keep a regular stream of information flowing\nbetween the board and the family and to help the next generation learn\norganically about the company as they matured. Other companies start to\ninclude family members in meetings when they enter high school or college to\nexpose them to the business.\n\nFamilies often take responsibility for developing guidelines around family\nemployment in the business, such as requiring a certain number of years of\nwork outside the company and demonstrated success at it, or prohibiting jobs\nfrom being created just for family members. But the directors should ensure\nthat these policies are actually followed and weigh in on rules they don\u2019t\nthink serve the business or the family well.\n\n**Codify the rules.** Many businesses document next-generation talent-\ndevelopment processes in formal family constitutions or protocols, which also\ndetail agreements made about the business\u2019s vision, values, and decision-\nmaking approach. These might include such things as whether spouses have a\nformal say in decisions or who inherits the shares if a family member with no\ndirect heirs dies.\n\nDeveloping a constitution is hard work and often creates tension. If it feels\ntoo daunting, a good alternative is to set up a committee of outside and\nfamily directors and executives to oversee family member development, as one\nLatin American firm did. The committee designed a formal program in which\nrelatives under 40 were made directors of subsidiary boards for up to two\nyears, which helped them figure out whether they were interested in continuing\nin the business and allowed the directors to see their capabilities in action.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nDirectors often struggle with questions about pay for family members. How much\nshould they make relative to outside executives? Is it clear that outsiders\nmay need to be paid at the scale of large or public companies? Are there\nguardrails in place to avoid allegations of favoritism?\n\nIn one multibillion-dollar U.S.-based enterprise, brothers in different roles\nwere paid the same amount to keep the peace. The situation came to a head as\nnext-generation members began to seek employment and expected similar pay.\nWhile families often equate fair with equal, it isn\u2019t always, especially as\nlater generations join the business. It\u2019s important to break this paradigm,\nboth to manage expectations and to attract nonfamily talent. Often it makes\nsense for a board to create a compensation committee of independent directors\nand have them hire an outside consultant who can help craft a pay philosophy\nand support it with objective data.\n\n** ** **Underperforming Family Executives**\n\nThis is one of the thorniest problems deal with, but there are ways to nip it\nin the bud. Ideally, family members in the business should report to nonfamily\nbosses, who get the reinforcement they need to provide honest assessments.\nNonfamily supervisors of family employees are in a sensitive position, so\nshould be given clear direction on how to support and evaluate them. As family\nmanagers rise through the ranks, however, reporting to a nonfamily member may\nbecome unfeasible, and at that point, additional oversight by a committee of\nboard members can be useful. In addition, every family executive should be\nassigned a coach or a mentor. Often the senior independent director makes an\nexcellent coach for the senior family managers, and it helps to include other\nboard members in their performance reviews.\n\nLike other underperforming executives, struggling family members should be put\non an improvement plan, given an opportunity to do better, and if they can\u2019t,\nbe offered other opportunities in the business where they can succeed or a\npath to an exit. If it\u2019s clear to everyone they can\u2019t do their jobs, it harms\nthe culture of the company to keep them around. But it\u2019s extremely important\nto handle their exits delicately and allow them to save face with the family.\nIf they\u2019re put on a performance plan, that information should be kept\nconfidential, not shared with the broader family.\n\nAddressing an underperforming family CEO is especially tricky. Businesses can\nget themselves into this predicament if they don\u2019t do a thorough job of\nevaluating family CEOs and fail to give them clear performance metrics. Then\nwhen the CEO needs to be removed, family directors feel uncomfortable\nconfronting their relative. One thing we\u2019ve seen help in such situations is to\nhave the lead independent director introduce a \u201clong-term\u201d succession process\nthat starts with designing the ideal _future_ CEO profile and clearly defining\nthe performance expectations. Then the board can suggest comparing current CEO\nperformance with the ideal to identify gaps and areas for development, and\nquantify the opportunity cost of keeping the current CEO. This approach\ndepersonalizes the discussion of the current CEO and helps directors better\nunderstand the downsides of not making a change. The family may ultimately\ndecide to keep the CEO, which is their prerogative, but the board will have\nfulfilled its duty to generate options for them.\n\n**Asking Questions**\n\nCreating a board culture where asking questions is not only encouraged but\nexpected will help directors of family companies navigate all sticky issues.\nEven if independent directors can\u2019t always act, their probing questions can\ncatalyze the family to do the right thing.\n\nIt\u2019s good to suss out what the hot buttons are. In one U.S. company, the board\nsent an independent director to the annual family council meeting specifically\nto gather insights on this. The director asked the family: \u201cWhat are the\nsacred cows? What topics are fair for consideration and what should we avoid\nbringing up?\u201d\n\nSuch information helps directors understand what to move more slowly on (not\nwhat to avoid forever). Equally important, one director told us, is to listen\nto \u201cwhat\u2019s _not_ being said. You have to get comfortable triangulating a\nconversation \u2013 you really have to take the time. The family isn\u2019t one voice,\nit\u2019s multiple voices.\u201d\n\nUltimately, serving on a family business board requires more appreciation for\nmultiple points of view than serving on other boards, as well as much more\nfinesse and patience. It\u2019s a challenge \u2013 but a deeply rewarding one.

For a typical\ncompany, workforce costs total up to 70% of the cost of doing business. In\nfact, several studies performed a few years ago told a convincing story:\n\n  * EY found a [strong link](https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-Partnering-for-performance-the-CFO-and-HR/$FILE/EY-Partnering-for-performance-the-CFO-and-HR.pdf) between CFOs\u2019 level of involvement in strategic workforce planning and broader business performance.\n  * Bersin by Deloitte found that the share prices of companies with \u201cmature\u201d talent analytics [exceeded](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/human-capital/us-cons-people-analytics-maturity.pdf) those of their competitors by 30% over a three-year period.\n  * A survey by CEB (now Gartner) found that organizations could [increase gross profit margin](https://www.cebglobal.com/content/dam/cebglobal/us/EN/best-practices-decision-support/human-resources/pdfs/from-workforce-reporting-to-impactful-talent-analytics.pdf) by an average of 4%, and save roughly $12 million for every $1 billion in revenue, by taking a leadership position in workforce analytics.\n\n#### **Strategic Insight**\n\nEarly adopters of workforce analytics aimed their effort at simply managing\nthe total cost of workforce (TCOW). Today, CFOs working closely with HR can\nuse market and industry trends to identify workforce patterns and talent\nrisks, forecast productivity, uncover recruitment and retention challenges,\nproject ROI from HR initiatives, and pinpoint leadership opportunities that\ncould otherwise be missed.\n\nCFOs can use talent data to bring strategic insight to talent acquisition and\ndeployment by:\n\n  * Identifying ways to lower the cost of hiring, assigning, and engaging a productive workforce\n  * Ensuring compensation, benefits, and other rewards are aligned with business performance\n  * Targeting better ways of capturing ROI from HR development and well-being programs\n  * Determining and addressing signs of faltering performance\n  * Isolating mismatches in areas like benefits utilization\n  * Detecting and implementing process improvements across the workforce\n\nData and people analytics remove much of the guesswork behind key management\nand operational issues, helping companies make smarter talent decisions, boost\nperformance, and even challenge conventional wisdom that can blind\norganizations over time.\n\n#### **Linking Performance and HR Programs**\n\nData analytics also creates new opportunities for insight into the return on\nHR programs. For example, a company can look at population health and absentee\ndata alongside plan participation and rewards data, and then compare the\nfindings to productivity data in order to identify compelling corollaries\nbetween well-being and business impact.\n\nFinding out a particular demographic poorly utilizes health care screenings\nallows a company to design responsive and more effective wellness campaigns.\n\nPeople analytics can identify cost anomalies, especially in multinational\noperations where jurisdictional regulations vary widely. For example, staffing\ncosts can vary significantly by geography due to variations in salary ranges,\nbenefits costs, and employment laws. Modeling allows decision-makers to\nanalyze these costs and determine the best geographies for specific roles.\n\n[Predictive analytics](https://www.cfo.com/analytics/2016/10/special-report-\npromise-predictive-analytics/) can reveal other management decision-making\nblind spots. Suppose a company is contemplating a hiring freeze as an answer\nto declining profit. That\u2019s a common-enough scenario, but by applying\npredictive analytics it may become clear that a reduced workforce and greater\nworkload would not meet production demands.\n\nFurther analysis may reveal that hiring contingent staff, along with paying\novertime, could cost more than the savings reaped through a hiring freeze.\n\n#### **The Right Information**\n\nManaging unstructured data is a growing challenge as employers try to extract\n\u201csignals\u201d from diverse data sources, data management packages, and integration\nand forecasting tools and methodologies.\n\nThe question is what specific data and analytics CFOs and CHROs should\nprioritize to manage financial risk and ensure adequate return on labor costs.\n\nHow should companies break down workforce analytics to provide strategic\ninsight? We think there are four main areas to tap into:\n\n_Healthcare analytics_ : The combination of population health, absentee, plan\nparticipation, wellness, and related financial data can help better influence\nthe physical health of a population and help people effectively manage their\nhealth.\n\n_Financial analytics_ : Defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans,\nequity, compensation, and other personal financial data, coupled with business\ndata, helps assess the ROI on reward spend and helps employees better manage\ntheir short- and long-term financial goals.\n\n_Diversity analytics_ : Talent management, learning and development,\nsuccession planning, and related metrics can help to build work environments\nand reward structures that meet the needs of a multi-generational workforce\nand support diversity and inclusion goals. Predictive analytics can also help\nto improve recruitment and retention strategies.\n\n_Engagement analytics_ : Similar to external marketing efforts, internally\nfocused employee engagement analytics allow organizations to measure and\npredict how people react to program design, communication outreach, and market\nforces.\n\nThis combination of health, wealth, career, and engagement analytics provides\nthe insight needed to make the most effective investments in people and gives\nthem the tools they need to remain healthy and productive at work and in life.\n\nWithout that clear connection between employee performance and the\norganization\u2019s performance, managers can\u2019t properly evaluate and reward\nindividuals. Employees lose sight of where they fit into the big picture and\nbecome less engaged in the work. The company\u2019s overall performance suffers.\n\n#### **Analytics at the Right Time, in the Right Format**\n\nWhat leaders should be looking for is a single, intuitive, and responsive\nreporting system that eliminates the task of data validation and gives the CFO\nthe tools to start driving business performance.\n\nOne-off reports from disparate talent data sources \u2014 accomplished through\nspreadsheets, manual processes, IT coding, and the like \u2014 won\u2019t provide the\nstrategic insights needed to understand, predict, and monitor business risks.\n\nFind a workforce analytics platform that:\n\n  * Consolidates both financial and people data\n  * Doesn\u2019t solely rely on HRIS analytics for the evaluation of people data\n  * Gathers full people data across performance, talent, population health, engagement, and rewards inputs\n  * Establishes current-state baseline as a control measure\n  * Assesses and predicts true \u201creturn on people\u201d analysis with total cost of labor along with perceived and actual value derived from that labor, with the ability to segment to any business function\n  * Benchmarks this data against peers and ideal state\n  * Allows both HR and finance to model business and people scenarios for informed workforce decisions\n\n**Looking at Performance Through the Right Lens**\n\nToday\u2019s CFOs are not just on point to guide company financial performance.\nThey need to touch everything in the company\u2019s value chain, most definitely\nincluding the workforce. Talent analytics must become a strategic priority.\n\n_Jack Freker is CEO of_ _[Buck](https://buck.com/)_ _, an integrated HR and\nbenefits consulting, technology, and administration services provider._\n\n###### [Buck](https://www.cfo.com/tag/buck/), [Financial\nData](https://www.cfo.com/tag/financial-data/), [heath care\nanalytics](https://www.cfo.com/tag/heath-care-analytics/), [Jack\nFreker](https://www.cfo.com/tag/jack-freker/), [people\nanalytics](https://www.cfo.com/tag/people-analytics/), [predictive\nanalytics](https://www.cfo.com/tag/predictive-analytics/), [unstructured\ndata](https://www.cfo.com/tag/unstructured-data/), [workforce\nanalytics](https://www.cfo.com/tag/workforce-analytics/), [workforce\ndata](https://www.cfo.com/tag/workforce-data/)  \n\n[ ![](https://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/edd/2019/03/CFO_XCM_3-229x300.png)\n\n######\n\n### Big Data; Big Opportunities\n\n#### CFOs and their companies are becoming inundated with data.

And with more\nboards recognising HR as a strategic partner, how can HR leaders play a part?\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | February 18, 2020\n\nTopics: [Asia-Pacific](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/apac/) |\n[Leadership](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/leadership/) | [Learning and\nDevelopment](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/learning-development/) |\n[News](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/news/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/31225872_m.jpg)\n\n**_By Sunil Puri, APAC Director \u2013 Research, Innovation, and Product\nDevelopment, Center for Creative Leadership (CCL)._**\n\nHeads of HR, often considered custodians of talent, have traditionally shied\naway from active roles on boards. The feelings are mutual from the board\nstandpoint \u2013 while chief finance officers (CFOs) are routinely called upon to\ninform and even advise boards on financial matters, chief human resources\nofficers (CHROs) often play on the sidelines.\n\nBut that was back then. Things are changing rapidly in progressive Asian\ncompanies. People and talent issues, at the center of key governance issues\nand corporate failures in the last decade, have triggered this change in\nmindset.\n\nThe last few years have witnessed boards in Asia appreciating that talent or\npeople are the \u2018new currency\u2019 to future-proof organizations. Center for\nCreative Leadership\u2019s (CCL) latest research study _BOLD 3.0: Future Fluent\nBoard Leadership in Asia_ notes that one of the key emerging leadership roles\nof Asian boards is to help develop top-notch talent in the organization, not\nonly ensuring CEO succession, but also ensuring adequate focus on talent\ndevelopment across the enterprise. And therefore, CHROs are finding themselves\nspending more time with boards and board leaders.\n\nExemplar boards view the CHRO role no less than a CFO role since they both are\naccountable for two of the most critical resources in any enterprise. CHROs\nare expected to report critical human resource issues, and advise boards on\ntalent and related themes, basis their expertise in compensation, succession,\ntalent, performance management, and leadership development, etc. CHROs may\nalso play a key role in the remuneration or human capital committees in\nscrutinizing executive compensation, examining linkages of talent and\nperformance, focusing especially on CEO succession, and also on the broad\ntalent agenda.\n\nHere are five roles the HR function in general and CHROs in particular must\nplay directly and indirectly in order to help boards future proof\norganizations:\n\n**People Metric Reporter:** Boards rely on people metrics and data to gauge\norganizational health and make sound judgements on future strategy, often\nleaning on HR as trusted _people metric reporter_. Board members in fact may\nexpect HR to not only share people metrics, but also speak their mind on\nrelated talent issues. For instance, while engagement surveys are valuable as\na dip-stick evaluation of people engagement, HR can provide much more color on\nmotivation levels, and the level of connectedness people feel with the\norganization\u2019s mission, vision and values.\n\n**Strategy Influencer:** Strategy is often a shared responsibility of the\nmanagement and the board. While management drives strategy formulation and\nrollout, boards often bring in the outside-in perspective and act as trusted\nand dependable sounding boards. Boards also often expect management to produce\npeople strategy that supports the business strategy. This responsibility sits\nwith the HR, and HR functions in progressive organizations often play a\n_strategy influencer_ role. An important piece in there is HR\u2019s role in\ndriving the diversity and inclusion (D&I) agenda. While D&I initiatives do not\nand should not squarely be HR\u2019s responsibility, the HR department (in\npartnership with the CEO) is often the mouth-piece for communicating the D&I\nagenda.\n\n**Critical Committee Resource:** HR also plays advisor to various committees\nat the board level. HR usually is linked with compensation committees, but\nthere are opportunities with other committees as well, including governance,\nnominations, and even audit committees. As a _critical committee resource_ ,\nthe CHRO has the twin responsibility of representing people in the\norganization, irrespective of their level, and the management, accountable for\norganization performance.\n\n**Enterprise Culture Champion:** While culture is too critical an area to\nleave it to one function, HR does play a key role in implementing culture and\nrelated initiatives. As the _organization_ _culture champion_ , the CHRO (and\nhis/her team) defines, co-creates, and drives (almost always in partnership\nwith the CEO) the appropriate values and behaviors. The executive leadership\nteam (including the CHRO) have a shared responsibility in creating and driving\na culture that is linked strongly with business strategy. While it is crucial\nfor boards to define cultural changes needed to successfully pursue and\naccelerate any shift in strategy, HR plays an important role in measuring,\nanalyzing and communicating culture in the wider business. For instance, HR\ncan provide the data that allows the board to see not only how the existing\nculture aligns with strategy but also what progress is being made in building\nthe strategy that the organization aspires to.\n\n**Board Culture Advisor:** Finally, HR also wears the _board culture advisor_\nhat, in case the board needs help with its own culture! Board culture often\npivots around five key elements: collaboration, commitment, candor, challenge,\nand trust. Being people experts, HR leaders can advise the board on how to\ndrive the right behaviors to help the board lead as a cohesive team.\n\nWhile HR undoubtedly is a critical resource for boards as they shape future-\nfluent organizations, it stays an underutilized resource in most instances.\nThere is an opportunity on the table for boards to use HR as a key lever to\nfuture-proof enterprises, and for HR to think \u2018beyond the C-suite\u2019 as it\naspires and prepares to be a trusted consigliere to boards in Asia.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fthinking-\nbeyond-the-c-suite-hrs-role-in-board-leadership%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Thinking+Beyond+the+C-Suite%3A+HR%E2%80%99s+Role+in+Board+Leadership&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fthinking-\nbeyond-the-c-suite-hrs-role-in-board-leadership%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fthinking-\nbeyond-the-c-suite-hrs-role-in-board-leadership%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

The reason that matters is because those\ninvestments increase productivity by giving employees more to work with, they\ndrive overall economic growth and they help ensure the long-term\ncompetitiveness of the businesses by developing new products and perfecting\nthe ones we have. Companies that are not investing move toward obsolescence,\nespecially against competitors elsewhere who are.\n\nIn 2018, one estimate indicated that the 3,000 largest U.S. companies were\nsitting on $2.7 trillion, and they could have used a lot of that to invest.\nThat figure dropped to about $1.7 trillion this year, primarily because of\nstock buybacks, not investment. This does not count the amount of cash held\nabroad, which may be as much as $1 trillion. Capital investment grew 22% from\n2008 to 2017, while corporate profits grew by 33%. Investment jumped with the\ntax cut by 11%in 2018 but then fell back to roughly 3% this year. The lack of\nrobust investment is especially concerning given that we have been in a period\nof long-term economic growth; if we don\u2019t invest now, then when?\n\n**See also:[ _HRE_ survey: What's keeping you up at night?\n](https://hrexecutive.com/whats-keeping-you-up-at-night/)**\n\nSo, what could be done to enhance investment? The 2017 tax cut was a bit of a\ndud on that front, as the bump in investment that appeared to come with it did\nnot last more than a year.\n\nHere\u2019s a story based on a [highly credible\nstudy](https://www.nber.org/papers/w26519) of an intervention that did just\nthat: It raised capital investment and, in the process, the ratio of capital\nto labor. It also reduced outsourcing, and it shifted jobs somewhat toward\nhigher-skilled positions. Perhaps unfortunately for employees but not for\nshareholders, wages rose no faster with the intervention than without. That\nall sounds pretty good for the business, for investors and for the economy,\nright?\n\nSo, what was the intervention? It happened in Germany, and the \u201cexperiment\u201d\nthat made the analysis possible happened because some businesses were covered\nby it, while other, similar firms were not.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nThe intervention was having workers sit on the board of directors. One-third\nof the directors in the period since WWII had been employees, but a 1994 law\nexempted new companies from the requirement, which made the comparison between\nemployee directors and non-directors possible.\n\nDid we just feel the air go out of the balloon? I think so. The question is,\nwhy? Why is thinking about employee governance such a non-starter in the U.S.\ncontext?\n\nThe assumption is strong here that letting employees serve on boards is like\n\u201cletting the inmates run the prison,\u201d as an aphorism commonly used in this\ncontext puts it. They will be selfish, drive up wages, make jobs easier and so\nforth. Yet, there is no evidence of any of that in this context. Wages with\nemployee directors were not higher, financial and other measures of\nperformance were no worse. This was a test of the \u201cIf we just got rid of those\nworkers who were getting in the way, the companies would really take off\u201d\nhypothesis, and it failed miserably.\n\n**Related:[Does the presence of employees on corporate boards help\ncompanies?](https://hrexecutive.com/does-the-presence-of-employees-on-\ncorporate-boards-help-companies/)**\n\nWe don\u2019t know for certain what was so different in the companies that had\nemployee directors, but the best indication is that they were advocating for\nshop floor-level improvements to address work problems, hence the higher\ninvestment. It is easy to not recognize that employees typically have a much\nlonger and deeper attachment to a company and interest in its success than do\ninvestors, who can easily do the \u201cWall Street Walk\u201d and move on if there are\nproblems. It is typically easier for executives than regular employees to move\non if things go poorly.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nYes, we had some employee representatives on the boards of U.S. companies as\nwell, mainly in the 1980s, when the companies needed union concessions to\nsurvive. The quid pro quo was to put union reps on the boards, typically one\ndirector. We did not have neat experiments to assess the effect, but I never\nheard any evidence that those reps were messing up business success. A lot of\nthose companies failed, but the union reps were on them _because_ they were\nalready failing.\n\nI\u2019m not expecting this evidence to persuade a U.S. audience, given our prior\nassumptions. What is worth considering, though, is why there was and remains\nsuch widespread support for a tax cut that didn\u2019t work as a way to improve\ncapital spending, while an approach for which there is good evidence it did\nwork is a non-starter? It suggests something about the power of ideas, or more\naccurately, ideology, in how we think about business.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fthe-\npower-of-ideology-in-business%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Cappelli%3A+The+power+of+ideology+in+business&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fthe-\npower-of-ideology-in-business%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fthe-\npower-of-ideology-in-business%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Expenses, group benefits, and employee compensation may\nall be a big part of the conversation as you look for areas to control costs\nor trim spending.\n\nIf your health insurance renewal is at year end, then Open Enrollment is in\nfull swing, which means your employees are reviewing their expenses and\nthinking about which benefits are most important for their needs. Inevitably,\nmany of them will think about their current compensation as they make these\ndecisions. As an employer, this is an opportunity to learn about the things\nthat are important to your employees to help you determine the right mix of\nbenefits and compensation for your team.\n\n[There are several ways to create an effective and competitive benefits\nprogram at your small to mid-sized business. Here are a few ideas to\nconsider.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Frobertcerone%2F2019%2F11%2F14%2Fhow-\nto-determine-the-right-mix-of-benefits-and-compensation-for-your-\nstaff%2F&text=There%20are%20several%20ways%20to%20create%20an%20effective%20and%20competitive%20benefits%20program.%20Here%20are%20a%20few%20ideas%20to%20consider.)\n\n## Review Your Employees\u2019 \u201cTotal Compensation\u201d Package\n\nA \u201ctotal compensation\u201d approach to benefits and compensation promotes the idea\nthat your employees\u2019 compensation is more than their paycheck \u2013 it\u2019s the total\nof what\u2019s available to them. This includes\u2026\n\n  * **Monetary Compensation**. At its most basic, this is their salary.\n  * **Benefits**. This may include health insurance, short- and long-term disability insurance, employer contributions (match) to a retirement account, as well as health, wellness, and educational stipends.\n\n  * **Work-life effectiveness**. Includes things like schedule flexibility, office perks, and PTO.\n  * **Performance management**. This may look like tools or a plan to help the organization and individuals meet specific goals.\n  * **Talent development**. This may include an open door to professional development opportunities or a defined career ladder to help employees advance.\n  * **Recognition**. Are there bonuses associated with meeting certain targets or achievements?\n  * **Equity and profit-sharing.**\n  * **Employer-paid taxes**. Your employees should be aware that you pay Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, and workers\u2019 compensation on their behalf.\n\nCreating the right total compensation package depends on your organization\u2019s\nvalues, goals, and strategy for growth. It\u2019s important that the compensation\nand benefits offered support the culture and brand you\u2019re trying to build.\nOnce you know the types of employees you\u2019re looking to attract and retain, you\nshould build your total compensation plan with them in mind and budget\naccordingly.\n\n## Determining What Your Employees Need and Want\n\n A good way to make sure that you offer your employees benefits that they\nactually value is to ask them and evaluate their usage.\n\n  1. **Survey your employees directly**. Ask questions about which benefits they want and the ones they value the most. You may even ask for suggestions. \n  2. **Conduct an annual analysis of how benefits are being used**. Reviewing utilization will show whether your employees are actually using the benefits they say they want. If you make changes year over year, this is important to monitor.\n\nFor example, if your employees tell you that continued education is important,\nthe solution may be as simple as providing a modest stipend for professional\ndevelopment events each year. This may not be compensation in the traditional\nsense, but it can make a big difference in your employees\u2019 experience at your\ncompany.\n\nOther benefits you may want to consider include\u2026\n\n  * **An Employee Assistance Program (EAP)**. These programs typically include phone and email support for employees to get advice on issues they face in and out of the office. If employees are feeling distracted by financial troubles at home, health issues, or a conflict in their lives, these confidential advisors can guide employees to resources that will help them navigate their problems.\n  * **Stipends for wellness**. Encourage employees to care about their health and wellness by offering a stipend \u2013 maybe $100 per month \u2013 to subsidize a gym membership or massage therapy. \n  * **Financial planning workshops:** A simple lunch-and-learn series with a financial planner can help empower employees to take an active role in saving for their future. Guidance on investing in a retirement savings plan and leveraging an HSA or FSA is also a great way to help employees understand the value of such benefits.  \n\nWhatever direction you choose, pay attention to feedback from your people to\nuncover needs and offer benefits that are truly appreciated.\n\n## Assess Your Offerings: Are They Competitive?\n\nTo access the competitiveness of your plan and compensation with other\norganizations, turn to databases and benchmarking tools.\n\nFirms like [Mercer](https://www.imercer.com/ecommerce/products/us-mercer-\nbenchmark-database) offer annual reports that provide employee benefits and\ncompensation [benchmarks](https://www.mercer.us/our-thinking/healthcare/its-\nall-relative-why-benefits-benchmarking-is-important.html) based on industry,\nmarket, and business size. If you happen to work for a venture-backed startup\nthat meets certain criteria, you may be able to get access to useful\ncompensation data through [Option Impact](https://www.advanced-\nhr.com/products-overview) from Advanced-HR. These resources are not always\nfree, but if offering competitive benefits without overspending is important\nto your company, you may consider the investment.\n\nOf course, if you don\u2019t want to purchase data or evaluate on your own, you can\nreach out to a handful of peers in your industry to share data and insights.\nYou can also turn to an HR service provider like a\n[PEO](https://www.cognoshr.com/knowledge/what-is-a-peo), a benefits broker, or\nan HR consultant who specializes in this area.\n\n## Create a Communications Plan to Help Your Employees Make the Most of Their\nBenefits\n\nWhatever benefits your decide to offer, a communication plan will help\nincrease participation and appreciation among your employees.\n\nThis may look like a newsletter or a \u201cbenefits\u201d channel in Slack or other\ninternal communication platforms. Whatever format you choose, regular\ncommunications help remind employees of the benefits and resources available\nto them.\n\nCommunication around benefits and compensation shouldn\u2019t just happen during\nopen enrollment or new-hire orientation. Make sure you work on raising\nawareness year round.\n\n## Evaluating Impact and Success for Your Organization\n\nFinding the right compensation and benefits package for your employees is an\nongoing process and one that can change as your organization\u2019s goals and\nstrategy evolve.\n\nMake sure leadership is aligned with your benefits strategy, research your\noptions thoroughly, and regularly evaluate your efforts to make sure they are\neffective. Both your company and your employees will benefit.\n\n[![Robert\nCerone](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b9b5522f1a5fbe9eb30b3267f9404edc?s=400&d=mm&r=g)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertcerone/\n\"Photo of Robert Cerone\")\n\n[Robert Cerone](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertcerone/)\n\nI am the founder and CEO of Cognos HR, a Chicago-based PEO and HR consulting\nfirm that specializes in serving small and mid-sized businesses.

can positively impact diversity and inclusion efforts, but\nmay also lead to disappointment for others.\n\nBy: [Michael J. O'Brien](https://hrexecutive.com/author/mike-obrien/ \"Posts by\nMichael J. O'Brien\") | September 24, 2019 \u2022 2 min read\n\nTopics: [Talent\nAcquisition](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/talent-\nacquisition/) | [Talent\nManagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hpb/hpb-top-stories/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/salary-700x446.jpg)\n\nWhile many organizations often cite a \"competitive salary\" in their job\npostings, the lack of an _actual_ salary range can often leave qualified job\nseekers looking elsewhere.\n\nIndeed, according to [recent LinkedIn\nresearch](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/job-\ndescriptions/2018/job-description-heatmap), the networking site showed 450 of\nits members an example of a job description and asked them to highlight parts\nthey found helpful, appealing or would make them more likely to apply. The\nclear majority (61%) said that salary range and benefits are the most helpful\npieces of information on the entire job posting.\n\nBut a quick look at the job boards will demonstrate that most organizations\nhave yet to embrace the idea of sharing compensation ranges in job postings.\nAnd that may help to explain the recent [_Fast Company_ post by Lars\nSchmidt](https://www.fastcompany.com/90394268/why-its-time-to-include-\ncompensation-ranges-in-job-postings), who argues that \"the time has come\" for\nmore organizations to share such ranges.\n\nLiberty Mutual, Buffer, Publix, Enterprise Holdings and Basecamp, all include\ncompensation ranges in their postings, Schmidt writes, adding that Buffer even\nprovides a [transparent salary calculator](https://buffer.com/salary/senior-\nengineering-manager/average/) to help candidates understand how their\ncompensation compares to the cost of living.\n\nBut Alan Johnson, managing director at Johnson Associates, a New York-based\ncompensation-consulting firm, says he's \"leery\" of including a salary range in\njob postings. He's more open to the idea of companies publishing a data\npoint\u2014like a minimum salary\u2014instead of a range because it's all about managing\nexpectations.\n\n\"If you hire someone but their salary is not at the top of the range,\" he\nsays, \"then they are going to be disappointed, and that's not a great place to\nstart working.\"\n\nThe comp-range approach could also prove beneficial for some companies,\nJohnson adds.\n\n\"If the range for a job is $60,000 to $90,000,\" he says, \"there may be a few\npeople who would have been turned off at 60k, but you might get a few more\ncandidates at 90k. You may get a few more people into the funnel because they\nare turned on by the top part of the range.\"\n\nJohnson says he expects to see more companies adopting the comp-range approach\nin the coming years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\"I think, with all the work on income equality and diversity, it's going to\nincrease in usage,\" he says. \"The perception is that adding comp ranges will\nhelp us treat groups more fairly. Whether that's a good idea or not, we can\ndebate. But it's certainly a trend that's going to increase.\"\n\nCatherine Hartmann, the North America Rewards leader at Willis Towers Watson,\nagrees. \"If you are looking to be [more inclusive and\ndiverse](https://hrexecutive.com/inequity-in-the-workplace-is-increasingly-on-\nemployees-minds/) in your hiring pool,\" she says, \"more openness regarding the\ncompensation ranges in your job postings may be the way to go.\"\n\nGiven that, statistically, women and some minorities are less likely to\nnegotiate their salary, she says, the [move to be more\ntransparent](https://hrexecutive.com/uncovering-a-disconnect-on-pay-\ntransparency/) can support efforts for a broader set of potential new hires by\ntaking this negotiation off the table. \"Organizations still need to put\nmechanisms in place that focus on D&I to attract a broad spectrum of\nemployees,\" Hartmann notes.\n\nAs [salary-history questions](https://hrexecutive.com/saying-goodbye-to-\nsalary-history-questions/) continue to slide out of favor (and legality) in\nmany areas, Hartmann says, employers are looking for new ways to talk with\ncandidates about compensation.\n\n\"The latest data from Willis Towers Watson's _U.S. Compensation Planning\nSurvey_ indicated that, while only 26.2% of companies are currently fully\ntransparent with employees regarding the range of compensation for their\ncurrent salary band/pay grade, this number jumps to 59.8% when you ask these\nsame companies what they are considering implementing in the future,\" she\nsays. \"The movement towards greater pay transparency is today\u2019s new reality.\"\n\nHartmann advises HR leaders at organizations implementing a comp-range policy\nto have a communication strategy in place \"that is mindful of both the\nadvantages and disadvantages\" of being more transparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\"Before making the change, be sure to do your homework and have a solid\nunderstanding of what is market prevalent and where market trends are headed,\"\nshe says. \"Know what your talent competitors are doing, ensure that the change\naligns with what is best for your attraction and recruitment strategy, and\nhave a strong administrative process and tools in place for managing questions\nregarding going more transparent.\"\n\nUltimately, Hartmann says, the trend toward transparency could render current\nefforts at transparency moot, citing a recent Glassdoor list of the highest-\npaying organizations and top-paying jobs on its platform for 2019 that\nincludes the median total salary for each of the top organizations.\n\n\"So, whether a company decides to publish their compensation ranges themselves\nthoughtfully or have its information displayed online for them by outside\nparties,\" she says, \"this question may not be relevant in the distant future,\nas compensation-range data becomes more readily available and accessible to\ncandidates.\"\n\nMichael J.

Sumser](https://hrexecutive.com/author/john-sumser/ \"Posts by John\nSumser\") | November 7, 2019 \u2022 3 min read\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/themes/riskandinsurance/avatars/426.png)\n\nEmerging Intelligence columnist John Sumser is the principal analyst at\n_HRExaminer_. He researches the impact of data, analytics, AI and associated\nethical issues on the workplace. John works with vendors and HR departments to\nidentify problems, define solutions and clarify the narrative. He can be\nemailed at hreletters@lrp.com.\n\nTopics: [Benefits and\nCompensation](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/) |\n[Columnists](https://hrexecutive.com/category/columnists/) |\n[Compensation](https://hrexecutive.com/category/compensation/) |\n[Compensation](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/compensation-\nbenefitsandcompensation/) | [HR\nTechnology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [HR Technology\nConference News](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-technology-\nconference/) | [Talent\nManagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/)\n\nJust about a decade ago, I left the board of directors at Salary.com after we\ntook the company through an IPO then sold it a couple of years later. During\nthe time I was on the board, I learned more about salary data and its\nmanagement than I imagined possible. Back then, Salary.com was pioneering\ntechniques that would come to be called artificial intelligence. They took\n[massive quantities of data](https://hrexecutive.com/companies-shifting-hr-\ntech-focus-to-data/) and used it to predict the value of a job.\n\nThere\u2019s also a wonderful story to be told about the founder, Kent Plunkett,\nfiguring out how to buy the company back five years later. But that's another\nlong article.\n\nSince leaving the board, I haven\u2019t followed the company\u2019s evolution closely.\nSo, I was surprised when the company showed me the most interesting technology\nI saw at this year\u2019s [HR Technology\nConference](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-technology-\nconference/). I have the good fortune of getting to see the latest and\ngreatest as it heads into the market, and this product floored me.\n\nThe power of a great innovation is never in the product itself. The automotive\nrevolution was never one person driving a car, it was the transformation of\nthe culture that evolved from the invention. While Google makes search\nseamless and easy, the value stems from the way that search became a part of\neveryday life.  \n  \n  \n  \n\nThis year, Salary.com introduced a tool that delivers a specific market price\nfor a specific job in 15,000 different occupations. It sounds so completely\nmundane that you are hereby forgiven for not instantly seeing its importance.\n\nTransformation trails innovation. The two things rarely happen concurrently.\nNo one imagined the aerospace industry when the newspapers reported that the\nWright Brothers\u2019 plane stayed aloft. The power of Salary.com\u2019s new offering is\nthe array of things that it makes possible.\n\n[HR's compensation function](https://hrexecutive.com/whats-at-the-heart-of-\nthis-compensation-conundrum/) is where economics is practiced in its most\nmystical form. Historically, the process to determine the price of a given job\nwas a combination of generalized survey data, a bit of company policy,\nparametric estimations, and the analysis of job descriptions. There was always\na big dose of art melded with the science.\n\nWith the Salary.com market pricing tool, a compensation analyst (or anyone,\nfor that matter) can adjust the value of a job by adjusting factors that\ninclude skills, competencies, experience, education, location, company size,\nindustry, certifications, licenses, working conditions, levels and shift\ndifferentials. The rapidly growing library of jobs contains market-pricing\ndata for each of the subcategories suggested by those top-level groups.  \n  \n  \n  \n\nThe tool is a homerun for pay equity. By deeply quantifying all of the skills\nand variables that comprise the value of a specific job, the Market Pay Tool\nmakes it possible to rationally compare one worker with another based on\nqualifications, experience, depth of responsibility and so on. It turns a\ndifficult conversation into a straightforward reconciling of the elements of\ncompensation.\n\nThere\u2019s an even more powerful possibility.\n\nHR systems are plagued by a difficult problem. Only about 20% of employees\never fill out their profiles in the HR system, and most of these are \u201chigh-\npos.\u201d When a company wants to understand how to [evolve the workforce for the\nfuture](https://hrexecutive.com/looking-ahead-to-the-future-of-work/), the\ncurrent baseline is nowhere to be found. The problem stems from the fact that\nthe introspection required to complete the profile is challenging, and there\nis no real incentive for taking the time to do the work.\n\nSalary.com\u2019s Market Pricing Tool makes it possible to imagine a project that\nsimultaneously solves the [pay-equity problem](https://hrexecutive.com/equal-\npay-act-and-pay-equity/) while thoroughly inventorying the skills and\nexperience assets of the company\u2019s talent. If each boss met with each employee\nto determine that their job was paying the proper market rate\u2014including\nadjusting for the personalized skills, knowledges and capabilities that\nparticular employee brings to the position\u2014both goals could be achieved\nsimultaneously.\n\nIt\u2019s that possibility that makes this the most interesting thing I saw this\nyear at HR Tech. The Market Pricing Tool opens the door to organizational\nimprovements not imagined by its creators.\n\n[Click HERE for our full coverage of HR Tech.\n](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-technology-conference/)\n\n\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fjohn-\nsumser-how-to-drive-salary-transparency-with-intelligent-tools%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=John+Sumser%3A+Driving+salary+transparency+with+intelligent+tools&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fjohn-\nsumser-how-to-drive-salary-transparency-with-intelligent-\ntools%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fjohn-\nsumser-how-to-drive-salary-transparency-with-intelligent-tools%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Each city or province has followed this up with detailed\nimplementation rules for their specific regions.\n\nShanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and other cities / provinces have\nformally required enterprises (except those organizations involved in\nproviding basic services for residents and those involved in combating the\nspread of the virus) to not resume work prior to the February 10.\n\n#### [Related services](https://www.dezshira.com/services/payroll-human-\nresource-administration)\n\n  * [![](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Professional-Service_CB-icons-2017.jpg)Our HR and payroll services help foreign employers stay competitive](https://www.dezshira.com/services/payroll-human-resource-administration)\n\nThis is only the second time that the Chinese Central Government has extended\na holiday period (the first was for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of\nthe end of World War 2 in 2015). The current situation is a reaction to\npreventing the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nHowever, many China HR professionals are facing awkward legal questions from\nemployees related to this holiday extension.\n\nFor example, should the extended days be treated as statutory public holidays\nor rest days, or should annual leave be deducted, or should deferred working\ndays be arranged at weekends? Can enterprises arrange employees to work at\nhome before resuming work? Should overtime payments should be made if\nenterprises ask employees to work during the extended days? These types of\nquestion have quickly become hot topics for businesses operating in China.\n\nWe will address these issues in this article.\n\nShanghai's Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau answered these\nquestions at a press conference on January 28, 2020.\n\nThe State Council and Shanghai Municipal Human Resources and Social Security\nBureau\u2019s regulations are summarized as below. We also add our own\ninterpretations based on our best understanding at the current time:\n\nAccording to the \"Notice on Extension of 2020 Chinese New Year Holiday\" issued\nby the China State Council on January 26, 2020, this Chinese New Year Holiday\nwill be extended to February 2, 2020 (this coming Sunday). If employees are\nunable to rest during this period due to prevention / control of the epidemic,\nrest in lieu should be arranged or remuneration should be paid in accordance\nwith the related policies.\n\nIn practice, should the extended days of holiday be treated as statutory\npublic holidays or rest days, and how should overtime payments be calculated?\n\nIn 2015, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, the PRC\ncentral government decided to add one day of holiday on September 3, 2015. At\nthat time the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China stipulated that if the employer asked employees to work on\nthe special holiday, rest in lieu should be arranged or remuneration should be\npaid at 200 percent of the employee\u2019s standard salary. Therefore, in our\nopinion, the same calculation standard should apply to this 2020 holiday\nextension unless otherwise advised.\n\nMeanwhile, the Shanghai Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau\nhas also explained that the extended days should be treated as rest days.\nEnterprises should pay salary to staff not working during this period; and\narrange rest in lieu or pay double salary to those staff having to work.\n\n#### [Related News](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/employee-retention-\nstrategy-china-best-practices/)\n\n  * #### [How to Develop an Effective Employee Retention Strategy in China](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/employee-retention-strategy-china-best-practices/)\n\nThe Shanghai Municipality has advocated enterprises to arrange work-at-home\nduring the extended days. Working at home as required by the enterprise should\nbe treated as overtime work on a rest day. Rest in lieu should be arranged or\novertime payment should be made.\n\nHowever, this still poses questions. Are there differences between the Chinese\nNew Year holiday extension (from January 31, 2020 to February 2, 2020)\nannounced by the State Council and the delay of work resumption (from February\n3, 2020 to February 9, 2020) announced by the Shanghai Municipality and other\nregional / municipal governments?\n\nIf those persons involved in providing basic services to residents and those\ninvolved in combating the spread of the virus need to work from February 3,\n2020 (Monday) to February 7, 2020 (Friday), no rest in lieu or overtime\npayment should be arranged.\n\nOn the contrary, if those persons worked during the period from January 31,\n2020 to February 2, 2020, either rest in lieu should be arranged, or overtime\npayment should be made.\n\nThe purpose for the Shanghai Municipality to require enterprises not to resume\nwork earlier than February 10, 2020 is to reduce the risk of crowd gathering,\nrather than to increase the length of the Chinese New Year holiday.\n\nChina HR professionals may further ask whether it is possible to arrange and\ndeduct annual leave for the period from February 3 to 7, 2020, considering\nthat the enterprises are not allowed to resume work. This has not been\nspecified in any announcement or explanation yet.\n\nHowever, we may refer to Article 5 of the \"Announcement of the State Council\non the Regulations of Paid Annual Leave of Employees\" in which it is stated:\n_\u201cEnterprises shall coordinate and arrange for the annual leave of employees\non the basis of the specific conditions of production and work, and the\nindividual preference of employees. \"_\n\n#### [Related services](https://www.dezshira.com/services/payroll-human-\nresource-administration)\n\n  * [![](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Professional-Service_CB-icons-2017.jpg)Do you need help paying your local employees? ](https://www.dezshira.com/services/payroll-human-resource-administration)\n\nIt means that enterprises have autonomy to arrange the annual leave.\nMeanwhile, the employees\u2019 individual preference should be taken into\nconsideration.\n\nTherefore, if enterprises internally arrange annual leave during this period\n(because the business is interrupted by the coronavirus issue) in our view, it\ndoes not break the Shanghai government\u2019s rules from the legal perspective.\n\nIn practice, it is recommended to obtain a consensus with your employees on\nthe annual leave arrangement. Of course, if the enterprises are willing to\ntake more social responsibility in this difficult time, this will have knock\non effects concerning future staff retention and reputation enhancement.\nEmployees want to know their employer is acting responsibly and will look\nafter and protect them.\n\nApart from the Shanghai government, the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and\nSocial Security Bureau also issued the \"Notice on Maintenance of Stable Labor\nRelationship During Epidemic Prevention and Control Period\" on January 23,\n2020. The salaries to be paid in the treatment period, quarantine period, and\nwork resumption period are specified in this Notice:\n\n  1. Employees suffering from coronavirus should be granted a treatment period. Enterprises should pay for sick leave according to the labor contract or collective contract. The sick leave payment should not be lower than 80 percent of the minimum salary standard of Beijing Municipality;\n  2. Employees in the quarantine period and / or medical observation period should be paid by their employers as normal; and\n  3. For any employees failing to return to Beijing and therefore unable to resume work on time due to the epidemic situation, the employer can treat the absence as annual leave. In case of failing to resume work for a long time, the staff can be arranged to be furloughed by consensus. During the furlough period, the enterprises should pay a basic allowance of not lower than 70 percent of the Beijing minimum salary standard.\n\n#### [Related services](https://www.dezshira.com/services/information-\ntechnology-solutions)\n\n  * [![](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Professional-Service_CB-icons-2017.jpg)Which area of Technology does your business need help with?](https://www.dezshira.com/services/information-technology-solutions)\n\nFor those staff currently on business travel who fail to return to Beijing due\nto the epidemic, the enterprises should pay salary as normal.\n\nNote we have provided guidance on the technical aspect of having staff working\nfrom home in the article \"How to Operate Your China Business Remotely during\nthe Coronavirus Outbreak\" (see [here](https://www.china-briefing.com/news/how-\nto-operate-your-china-business-remotely-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/)).\n\nIt is important to note that the advisories given have thus far been issued by\nBeijing and Shanghai.

concerns about employee health and wellbeing are not\nenough for employers, the fast-changing coronavirus scenario unfolding\nglobally has become the type of nightmare that requires nothing less than a\nmultifaceted approach.\n\n\"Now is the time\" for businesses and other entities to begin preparing for\npossible spread of COVID-19, also known as coronavirus, said Nancy Messonnier,\ndirector of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center\nfor Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a conference call on Feb. 25.\n\nMore specifically, Messonnier suggested that \"businesses can replace in-person\nmeetings with video or telephone conferences and increase teleworking\noptions,\u201d among other precautions. She added that the \u201cpotential public-health\nthreat posed by COVID-19 is high, both globally and to the United States.\u201d\n\nAs of Tuesday, the _[New York\nTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/world/coronavirus-news.html)\n_reports more than 100 cases in the U.S. across 15 states, with six deaths.\nGlobally, more than 90,000 have contracted the illness.\n\nAround the world, employers are scrambling to decide just how to help ensure\nemployees\u2014no matter where they work or travel for business\u2014are as safe as\npossible with fears of a pandemic growing.\n\n**Related:[ 'Handshake-free' meetings and other coronavirus\nprecautions](https://hrexecutive.com/handshake-free-meetings-and-other-\ncoronavirus-precautions/)**\n\n\u201cCompanies have a moral and legal obligation to look after employees\u2014whether\nit\u2019s mitigating travel risk or looking after their general health and\nwellbeing,\u201d says Mark McSpadden, vice president of global product strategy and\nexperience at American Express Global Business Travel, which manages more than\n$35 billion of the world\u2019s business travel each year.\n\n\u201cTravel plans and business meetings are disrupted by health issues,\ngeopolitical unrest, bad weather and aircraft technical issues around the\nworld every day,\u201d he says, adding that, with fast-moving, fluid disruptors\nlike coronavirus, employers are revisiting their business-travel policies and\nplanned meetings and events schedules in real time to keep pace with travel\nadvisories and restrictions.\n\n\u201cWhen business trips and meetings are being postponed or cancelled, providing\ntimely and accurate communication with travelers and event attendees is\ncrucial,\u201d McSpadden says.\n\nOn the information front, a new survey commissioned by Prudential of more than\n2,000 adults found that Americans see employers as having a dual role to play\nin addressing risks associated with the virus, both in protecting their health\nand wellbeing and as trusted providers of information, including resources to\nhelp manage its financial impact.\n\nThe research found that 43% of Americans say they are concerned they will\npersonally contract coronavirus, while 45% are concerned about an outbreak\nthat requires quarantines and limits their ability to work for several weeks.  \n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus.Quarantine.3.3.20.png)  \nThe survey also revealed that, despite a low incidence of the virus in the\nU.S. to this point, many Americans have already begun to change their day-to-\nday habits and behaviors. For example, one in five American adults say they\nare avoiding public spaces with large crowds, such as movie theaters,\nrestaurants and shopping malls. Fifteen percent are avoiding public\ntransportation, and 12% report staying home from work if they are feeling\nsick.\n\n**See also:[Coronavirus: HR's role](https://hrexecutive.com/coronavirus-hrs-\nrole/)**\n\nMore than half of those surveyed (54%) believe that employers are responsible\nfor protecting the public during this kind of potential health crisis. What\u2019s\nalso striking is that Americans say they trust their employers (45%) slightly\nmore than they trust the news media (44%) for information about crises, such\nas the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\u201cCommunication is key,\u201d says Sharon Smith, Prudential\u2019s chief medical officer,\nnoting that there are three key steps employers can take to help support\nemployees: prepare for needs and questions; communicate regularly and often;\nand ensure consistent and accurate messages.\n\n**See also:[Steve Boese: Navigating mergers, acquisitions and\ncoronavirus](https://hrexecutive.com/steve-boese-navigating-mergers-\nacquisitions-and-coronavirus/)**\n\n\u201cParamount to success is a health-emergency team that has representation\nacross the company,\u201d Smith adds. \u201cThe goal is to provide a safe environment\nthat supports both employees and the business.\u201d\n\nAccording to a recent pulse survey from the Institute for Corporate\nProductivity (i4cp), a member-based nonprofit research firm that explores\n\u201cnext practices\u201d in human capital, 30% of employers polled report having a\n\u201cvery high\u201d concern about the coronavirus in their organization when it comes\nto considering employee travel decisions, while another 21% fell into the\n\u201chigh\u201d category. Also, 71% said they have communicated with their workforce\nregarding coronavirus.\n\nLorrie Lykins, vice president of research at i4cp, explains that, as a\nresearcher, her natural default is to lead with data, but she warns that\ndoesn\u2019t mean that a steady drumbeat of updates in \"Twitter-time reporting\" on\nthe latest number of victims is helpful.\n\n> **Related**\n>\n>   * [Coronavirus: HR\u2019s role](https://hrexecutive.com/coronavirus-hrs-role/)\n>   * [How HR can get ahead of a potential\n> recession](https://hrexecutive.com/could-coronavirus-fast-track-the-u-s-\n> toward-recession/)\n>   * ['Handshake-free' meetings and other coronavirus\n> precautions](https://hrexecutive.com/handshake-free-meetings-and-other-\n> coronavirus-precautions/)\n>\n\n\u201cBeing mindful of employee wellbeing means taking a holistic approach that\nincludes communication that shares facts as needed about prevention from\nsources including the CDC, the [World Health Organization] and the [National\nInstitutes of Health],\u201d she says, adding that it\u2019s also important to keep\nemployees informed of corporate decisions, especially because some are being\nmade in real-time.\n\nTreating employees as adults and offering them the flexibility to make\ndecisions about commuting/traveling\u2014or not\u2014whenever possible, sends the right\nmessage, Lykins says.\n\n\u201cThere is a fine balance between being proactive in sharing helpful\ninformation with employees and generating anxiety,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s possible\nto over-communicate in situations like the one we are now in, which can\nunintentionally add to stress and even panic.\u201d\n\nLykins will get no argument from Corey Stowell, vice president of human\nresources at Webasto Roof Systems Americas, a global Tier 1 supplier of\nroofing and heating systems to the automotive industry.\n\nWebasto, which has operations throughout China (including in Wuhan, the\noriginal source city), directly handled coronavirus cases within the company\u2019s\nGermany office in January. Stowell says it\u2019s an experience that lends\ncredibility to the organization as a whole, as both offices were able to come\ntogether and devise a number of \u201ckey things learned\u201d to serve as models for\nother employers seeking preventative measures.\n\n\u201cLarge, global or even regional organizations should maintain continuous\ninternal contact to align on new developments, and knowledge share on employee\nfeedback and how to best communicate new incidents as situations unfold,\u201d\nStowell says. \u201cThis has to be a joint effort, as a single person can\u2019t lead an\norganization through this alone.\u201d\n\nStowell advises the following in managing this quickly evolving virus and any\npotential employee impact:\n\n  * Focus: Address infected areas/regions and not the nationality of those involved.\n  * Educate: Explaining how the virus is contracted, what colleagues can do to prevent contracting and/or spreading the virus and where to go for more information are critical elements.\n  * Communicate: Knowledge is power, and communicating often will help put fears to rest. Be transparent so colleagues aren\u2019t concerned that there is any concealment of key information, while also being careful to maintain and respect the privacy of any (possibly) infected colleagues.\n  * Build: Identify outside organizations that can comprise a network of experts with up-to-date resources for referencing and sharing. This will help address concerns from colleagues and allow for organizations to leverage the expertise of those on the frontlines to help compile accurate and credible information from key experts (CDC, WHO, local health department, hospital systems, etc.).\n  * Suspend: Call off global travel to infected areas as much as possible and bring home those who may be on the road. If someone traveling has experienced \u201cCategory 1\u201d form of contact while in an infected area (per German research organization [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Kontaktperson/Management.html)), ask those colleagues to work remote for 14 days, which is the estimated incubation period for the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cHR\u2019s role becomes notably more active and sensitive in this situation,\u201d\nStowell says. \u201cListen and let people address their concerns while displaying\nempathy and understanding, [and] help assess each case with care for the good\nof the whole organization.\u201d\n\nStowell says the Webasto HR, communications and legal departments collaborated\non direct, transparent and timely messages both internally and externally for\nglobal alignment. Also, a task force established in Germany, where the parent\ncompany is headquartered, sent aligned internal updates to all colleagues; the\nAmericas region followed up with additional information tailored for the\nregion.

It\nwill stay this way too, as organisations need to become agile, continually\nmorphing and transforming in line with more sophisticated data management as\nwell as frequent regulatory updates and iterations.\n\nIn terms of operations and, more specifically, HR, banks can analyse data on\nemployees to optimise business functions, better attract and engage top\nperformers, and improve productivity in the same way that they leverage\ncustomer behavioural analytics to improve products and services.\n\nHolistic capturing of data can inform and fuel all manner of cultural\ntransformation. With a greater view and better management of staff\ncompensation across an organisation, a light can be shone on any pay\ninequalities, for example. Thus, diversity issues can be addressed and\neradicated.\n\nManual processes, heavily reliant on spreadsheets, are overdue for\ntransformation, and greater understanding of rewards strategy and history\nalongside a better understanding of employees can strengthen and promote a\nstronger business ethos and brand and help attract the best talent. In this\nway, data-fuelled technology to improve compensation management can yield\nwider benefits to the business, and with a simplified and agile data\nmanagement system, schemes of equal and greater complexity can be supported.\n\nDownload the full paper to find out more.\n\n* * *\n\n### Get the report\n\nEmail address*\n\nTitle (Mr/Ms/Mx etc)*\n\nFirst name*\n\nLast name*\n\nJob title*\n\nOrganisation*\n\nCity*\n\nCountry*\n\nBy clicking on the submit button, I consent to Beqom keeping me informed about\nthe latest news on technology and trends shaping the future of Financial\nServices, I can unsubscribe at any time.*\n\nPlease tick this box if you would like Finextra Research to keep you informed\nabout our events and services (such as relevant industry events) by e-mail,\nyou can unsubscribe at any time\n\nBy submitting this form, you are confirming you are an adult 18 years or older\nand you agree to Beqom contacting you with marketing-related emails and phone\ncalls.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nGenine Wilson\n\nGenine Wilson is [Kelly Services'](https://www.kellyservices.us/us) Vice\nPresident of the Pacific region.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nMuch has been written about creating training programs that improve business\nperformance, but the impact of training on the employee deserves just as much\nattention. In fact, one could argue that when it comes to attracting and\nretaining talent, a sustained commitment to learning and development\nthroughout an employee\u2019s tenure is better than any salary increase.\n\nAt a time when employee mobility is at a record high, employers must rethink\ntheir training programs so employees feel valued and are motivated to stay and\nadvance in the organization because they can see the internal growth\nopportunities. While a pay bump can serve as a temporary fix, investing in an\nemployee\u2019s development through training offers long-term value for both the\nemployer and the employee. Let\u2019s unpack the myths and counter the arguments\naround training.\n\n**Myth: Money talks, and the best employees are going to leave for better-\npaying jobs regardless of the training you offer them.**\n\nThere\u2019s a misperception that training is a wasted investment because it is\nexpensive and there is no guaranteed return for the employer. A company could\ninvest in an employee\u2019s development only to see them improve their skills and\nleave.\n\nThe counter to this argument is to train employees well and communicate what\nopportunities for career advancement exist at your company so they\u2019ll want to\nstay. Training programs demonstrate a company\u2019s commitment to employees and\ntheir personal development. When employees understand the investment a company\nis making in them and how development can help them do the best job possible\nand ultimately take on a bigger role, it can have a very powerful effect on\nteam members because it reinforces the value you place on them.\n\nA survey by LinkedIn found that\n\"[94%](https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report-2018)\nof employees would stay at a company longer if it invested in their career\"\nand [87%](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236438/millennials-jobs-\ndevelopment-opportunities.aspx) of millennials believe the availability of\ndevelopment opportunities is important in a job.\n\nLack of career growth and development opportunities is the No. 1 reason\nemployees quit their jobs, with more than\n[22%](https://info.workinstitute.com/hubfs/2019%20Retention%20Report/Work%20Institute%202019%20Retention%20Report%20final-1.pdf)\nof workers citing it as the cause for their leaving. The good news is, the\nfindings indicate that those who are very satisfied with their career\ndevelopment are more likely to stay, meaning employers have the capability to\nkeep those workers from departing if they address the issue proactively.\n\n**Myth: The investment won\u2019t pay off.**\n\nCompanies must think carefully about how they invest in talent. Will it be via\ncompensation, benefit changes, perks or helping employees advance their\ncareers?\n\nPayScale asked employers which HR line item would be their biggest this year,\nand nearly one-fourth (23%) said employee training and development \u2014 more than\nany other area. By comparison, 15% said recruiting, 15% said compensation\nchanges, 11% said HR software, 10% said benefits, 8% said retention, 8% said\nengagement of employees and 6% said managing performance.\n\nAn investment in employee development is more than compensation; it is a high-\ntouch responsibility and speaks more convincingly to the value of the employee\nthan a one\u2011time salary increase.\n\nLearning and development pays off in other ways:\n\n  * It can help close the gap in skills when an employee is struggling with an aspect of their job.\n  * It not only improves an employee\u2019s technical skills, but it also optimizes efficiency and therefore profitability.\n  * Managers become leaders in a much shorter amount of time, acquiring the skills to advance their careers.\n\n**Myth: No one has time for training.**\n\nThe need for effective training has never been greater. The emergence of\ntechnology and digitization requires new skill sets that will likely force\nsome companies to divert budgets away from compensation to training. Employers\nmust make time for employee training and ensure it is easily digestible and\ncan be measured, allowing them to build up their future workforce.\n\nAn industry expert on corporate training, the Game Agency\u2019s Stephen\n[Baer](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/04/04/four-\nelements-of-effective-employee-training/#3bf29ded1818), recommends that\neffective training satisfies the Four M\u2019s: it\u2019s micro, mobile, memorable and\nmeasurable.\n\n  * Micro: Make it easily digestible, using short videos or daily quizzes.\n  * Mobile: Make it portable so employees can take the course with them and complete it on any device.\n  * Memorable: Use gaming technology to create an immersive experience.\n  * Measurable: Analyze the data to not only confirm compliance, but to continually improve content.\n\nThese tips are by no means exhaustive, but they align with the digital world\nwe live in, where it\u2019s easy to become overwhelmed. Learning must be laser-\nfocused, interactive and informed by data.\n\nAt a time when employee retention is the biggest concern of employers, money\nalone won\u2019t motivate employees or win their loyalty. Learning and development\nare rapidly eclipsing salary as the most effective way to ensure growth and\nengagement, giving employees the skills they need to perform, upskilling them\nto support innovation and keeping the best of them on board to successfully\nprepare your company for the future.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Genine Wilson](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2018/12/Genine-\nWilson_avatar_1543870657-400x400.jpeg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/geninewilson/\n\"Photo of Genine Wilson\")\n\n[Genine\nWilson](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/geninewilson/)\n\nGenine Wilson is [Kelly Services'](https://www.kellyservices.us/us) Vice\nPresident of the Pacific region.\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Genine Wilson&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: What Workers Value: Training Gains On Compensation In Importance %0A Author: Genine Wilson %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2019/11/27/what-workers-value-training-gains-on-compensation-in-importance/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

highlights employers on four criteria including innovation and\npeople management.\n\nBy: [Michael J. O'Brien](https://hrexecutive.com/author/mike-obrien/ \"Posts by\nMichael J. O'Brien\") | December 10, 2019 \u2022 3 min read\n\nTopics: [Awards](https://hrexecutive.com/category/awards/) | [Benefits and\nCompensation](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/) |\n[Diversity](https://hrexecutive.com/category/diversity/) | [Diversity and\nInclusion](https://hrexecutive.com/category/diversity-and-inclusion/) | [HR\nLeadership](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrleadership/) | [Learning and\nDevelopment](https://hrexecutive.com/category/learninganddevelopment/) | [Most\nAdmired for HR](https://hrexecutive.com/category/awards/most-admired-for-hr/)\n| [Talent Management](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/) |\n[Top Stories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hpb/hpb-top-stories/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Apple-\nImage-700x472.jpg)\n\nFor the second year in a row, Apple tops the list of _HRE_ \u2019s \u201cMost Admired\nfor HR\u201d companies. The Cupertino, Calif.-based electronics maker is followed\non this year\u2019s list by Netflix, Walt Disney Co., Target and Nordstrom.\n\nApple, with its HR Attributes Average score of 8.51, is no stranger to the top\nof this list, now in its 15th year. It attained the No. 1 ranking in 2016 and\nNo. 3 in 2015.\n\nThis year\u2019s list reflects a few changes from previous years. In 2018,\nattribute scores were not generated for the general-merchandisers and food-\nservices industries due to low response. As a result, only the aggregate\nindustry scores and ranks are published in food services, general\nmerchandisers, construction and farm machinery, and network and other\ncommunications equipment.\n\nWith scores available for these industries in 2019, several companies have\ncracked the top 50, including the aforementioned Target, Nordstrom (general\nmerchandisers), Starbucks (food services), Costco Wholesale (general\nmerchandisers) and Walmart Inc. (general merchandisers).\n\n**Related**[50 of the most admired for HR](https://hrexecutive.com/50-of-the-\nmost-admired-hr-leaders/)\n\nLikewise, several companies fell off last year\u2019s top 50 list due to attribute\nscores that were not generated in 2019. Because of the weak distribution of\nresponses, only the aggregate industry scores and ranks are published in\nconstruction and farm machinery; internet services and retailing; network and\nother communications equipment; metals, packaging and containers; and\ntelecommunications.\n\nAmong these casualties is Alphabet (internet services and retailing), which\nranked No. 2 on last year\u2019s list; Amazon.com (internet services and\nretailing), which ranked No. 5; Facebook (internet services and retailing) at\n10; Nucor (metals) at 37; and AT&T (telecommunications), which was 42 on last\nyear\u2019s list.\n\nThe companies that made this year\u2019s list show that it is possible to overcome\nthe many challenges inherent in today\u2019s business world while still retaining\nthe admiration of competitors, says Mark Royal, senior director at Korn Ferry.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s HR leaders face pressures to attract and retain talent amid tight\nlabor markets and shifting workforce expectations\u2014and to develop leadership\nand organizational capabilities to respond in agile ways to increasingly\ndynamic and competitive business environments,\u201d Royal says. \u201cThe companies on\nthis year\u2019s Most Admired for HR list are exemplary in navigating these\nchallenges across industries and geographies.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s list includes a number of new entries, including: Bosch Group,\nRaytheon, Toyota Industries, 3M, CVS Health, The Estee Lauder Cos., Activision\nBlizzard, BMW, Procter & Gamble, Taiwan Semiconductor, Michelin, Siemens,\nHilton Worldwide Holdings and Samsung Electronics.\n\nThe process of developing this definitive report card on corporate reputations\nbegins when Los Angeles-based management-consulting firm Korn Ferry teams up\nwith _Fortune_ to determine the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Admired Companies,\u201d which\nthey\u2019ve done since 1997. They started with the Fortune 1000\u2014the 1,000 largest\nU.S. companies ranked by revenue\u2014and non-U.S. companies in _Fortune_ \u2019s Global\n500 database with revenues of $10 billion or more. They then selected the\nhighest-revenue companies in each industry, surveying a total of 680 companies\nfrom 30 countries.\n\n**Related** [How the world\u2019s most admired companies drive diversity and\ninclusion](https://hrexecutive.com/how-the-worlds-most-admired-companies-\ndrive-diversity-and-inclusion/)\n\nTo create the 52 industry lists, Korn Ferry asked executives, directors and\nanalysts to rate companies in their own industries on nine criteria, from\ninvestment value to social responsibility. To arrive at _HRE_ \u2019s \u201cMost Admired\nfor HR\u201d rankings, Korn Ferry recalibrated the _Fortune_ attribute scores,\nisolating four criteria that have a bearing on HR\u2014management quality,\nproduct/service quality, innovation and people management.\n\nOf the companies in the Top 50 in 2018 and 2019, the biggest upward moves come\nfrom: Adobe Systems, Johnson & Johnson, Nvidia, BlackRock, Boeing, W.W.\nGrainger, Charles Schwab and Merck.\n\nThe HR organization at global pharmaceutical maker Merck, which rose 11 spots\nfrom 44 on last year\u2019s list to 33 this year, is made up of professionals with\nstrong business acumen who are seen as effective and trusted business\npartners, says Steven C. Mizell, executive vice president and chief human\nresources officer.\n\n\u201cAlignment between our talent strategy and business strategy is what ensures\nthat we have the right programs, policies and processes in place to best serve\nour people and our company,\u201d he says.\n\nTo that end, Mizell says, Merck is continuing to increase its use of data and\nanalytics, as well as talent-development initiatives and is also \u201cremaining\nunrelentless in our pursuit of a diverse and inclusive work environment.\u201d\n\nMizell has some simple advice for companies looking to make next year\u2019s list.\n\n\u201cHaving deep knowledge and understanding of your company\u2019s core business is\ncritical to the success of any HR team looking to improve their ability to\ndeliver on business objectives, and [it\u2019s] our critical mission.\u201d\n\nMichael J.

These are the key findings in the\nSalary Survey 2020 released by Robert Walters, a global recruitment specialist\ngroup headquartered in England and with regional offices in Southeast Asia.\n\nAccording to the survey, professionals looking to stay in their current roles\ncan expect salary increments of up to 10 percent while those moving jobs can\nexpect to receive a 20 percent to 40 percent salary increase depending on\ntheir seniority level and skill set.\n\n**** The continued shift to digitalisation will also boost demand for risk and\ncompliance professionals, who will play an essential role in helping companies\nand organisations address the evolving regulatory requirements and guidelines\nacross the region brought by the growth of digital banking, fintech and online\npayment solutions.\n\n\u2018Glocal\u2019 talent, or professionals with expertise in both local and\ninternational culture, mindset and market, will also be in greater demand as\nmore companies embrace internationalisation.\n\nHiring for potential instead of deciding based on experience will influence\nthe decision-making process of more hiring managers as demand for\nprofessionals with strong expertise in their own field, technological\nknowledge, and commercial mindset surpasses supply. Remuneration or salary is\nno longer the sole key motivator for professionals to stay in a job, with an\nincreasing number of employees looking for career progression and learning and\ndevelopment opportunities.\n\n**A data-driven Philippines**\n\nBusinesses in 2020 will emphasise more on a data-driven approach,\nstrengthening the demand for technologically and digitally savvy professionals\nacross all functions and ensuring an organisation-wide transformation.\nProfessionals with a commercial mindset who can leverage their industry\nexpertise with available data and new technology platforms to make effective\nbusiness decisions will be in greater demand.\n\nAlthough competitive remuneration and benefits remain a top driver of employee\nsatisfaction, 29 percent of those surveyed say they will change jobs for\ncareer progression. This highlights that in order for companies to retain\ntalent, they will also need to show their commitment to the learning and\ndevelopment of their employees.\n\nRobert Walters Philippines director Monty Sujanani emphasises the importance\nof companies moving with the times. \u201cWe encourage hiring managers in the\nPhilippines to listen and understand the shift in the hiring trends and what\nthis shift means for the company and its employees. The Robert Walters 2020\nSalary Survey will help employers satisfy the changing needs and preferences\nof their highly skilled employees and achieve a high retention rate.\u201d\n\nThe takeaways from the Robert Walters Salary Survey 2020 in different\nindustries include the following:\n\n  * **Accounting and Finance:** The top areas seeing demand are finance business partnering, transformation in shared services and tax. Career progression and opportunity to work internationally motivate employees to move jobs while competitive remuneration and benefits, good working culture and environment, and work-life balance are the top drivers of satisfaction at current jobs.

The top reasons employees move jobs are better compensation and benefits, and career progression, at 28 percent and 24 percent, respectively.\n  * **Human Resources:** Shared services and BPO, start-ups, pharmaceutical and consumer goods are the areas with strong demand.

Since\nevery organization has unique talent needs that evolve in tandem with business\nstrategies, the ways to manage these talent requirements need to be tailored\nas well.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the 4 steps in choosing the best-fit solution for your business.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze your needs for today and tomorrow**\n\n  \nTo judge whether an HCM software vendor is the right fit for your business\nneeds, you must first analyze what your needs are \u2013 at present and for the\nfuture. Furthermore, it helps to have a need-map of your must-have, good-to-\nhave, and great-to-have needs. Then, match this wishlist of sorts with the\nfeatures and functionalities that any solution offers.\n\n### **Step 2: Assess integration capabilities**\n\n  \nOnce you know what it is that you are looking for in an HCM software, it is\ntime to zone in on your SaaS options. Integrating all HR functions into a\nsingle HCM platform comes with assured cost benefits.\n\nThe task here is to understand which software components need to interact and\nshare data. For example, does your applicant tracking system (ATS) link into\nyour onboarding processes? The right HCM software offering will grow with your\nbusiness, and finding a solution that has the capabilities to integrate myriad\nfunctionalities and to grow is half the battle won.\n\n### **Step 3: Ascertain compliance risks**\n\n  \nWith local and federal regulations in a constant state of flux to incorporate\nand address the evolution of the business ecosystem, it is imperative to\nensure that your processes to manage your human capital are compliant. It\nhelps to stay updated on new laws and amendments, and thus, working with a\nvendor who is ready to evolve with these changes makes a big difference.\n\n### **Step 4: Appraise data security options**\n\n  \nA vendor that ensures data protection and cybersecurity and has a proven\nrecord of being able to manage both areas is a good bet. Since HCM software\nare basically powerhouses of data, strong security procedures need to be\napplied. These procedures also need to evolve with changes in data processes,\ntrends, and privacy policies.\n\nChoosing the right HCM software for your unique business needs is thus\ndependant on how well you understand these needs, the level of market research\nyou conduct to map out the pros and cons of viable options and the goals that\nyou have set for the future.\n\n**_What key features do you look for in your HCM solution?

out a significant shift for HR, as the function strives to\nredefine its mandate.\n\nBy: [Julie Cook Ramirez](https://hrexecutive.com/author/julie-cook-ramirez/\n\"Posts by Julie Cook Ramirez\") | January 10, 2020 \u2022 3 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) |\n[Learning and\nDevelopment](https://hrexecutive.com/category/learninganddevelopment/)

[Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/The-Human-Potential-of-\nAI-700x450.jpg)\n\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution has arrived, and it\u2019s blurring the lines\nbetween people and technology, fusing the physical, digital and biological\nworlds. That\u2019s the primary finding of a new study, _HR 4.0: Shaping People\nStrategies in the Fourth Industrial Revolution_ , conducted by the World\nEconomic Forum in collaboration with Saudi Aramco, Unilever and Willis Towers\nWatson. According to the study, the 4IR\u2019s impact will span all industries,\neconomies and societies, redefining work and the way businesses produce value.\nThe implications for HR are significant, according to Ravin Jesuthasan,\nmanaging director of talent and rewards in the Chicago office of Willis Towers\nWatson.\n\n\u201cMany of the constructs that we\u2019ve gotten used to, the idea of a person being\nin a job, are rapidly changing,\u201d says Jesuthasan. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty dramatic\npivot from where HR has been since its inception to what\u2019s going to be asked\nof it now.\u201d\n\n**Also see:** [John Sumser: Throw away your easy button\u2014it\u2019s the 21st\ncentury](https://hrexecutive.com/john-sumser-throw-away-your-easy-button-its-\nthe-21st-century/)\n\nSpecifically, HR is shifting from being a \u201csteward of employment\u201d\u2014recruiting,\nhiring, onboarding, training, and administering pay and benefits\u2014to being a\n\u201csteward of work,\u201d helping the business orchestrate how work is done, whether\nit\u2019s being done by a person in a job, a person augmented by a machine, a gig\nworker or an employee of an outsourcer, explains Jesuthasan.\n\nWhile HR might feel overwhelmed by this significant of a shift, Jesuthasan\nlooks upon the 4IR as a unique opportunity for HR to redefine its mandate and\nfurther advance the function.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n\u201cAs the Fourth Industrial Revolution plays out across companies, it\u2019s creating\nthis space for us to express our true humanity, empathy, creativity and\nability to communicate with emotional intelligence,\u201d says Jesuthasan. \u201cThere\nis a truly unique opportunity for HR to help companies make so much more of\ntheir human talent than might have ever been possible.\u201d\n\nThe report lays out six imperatives that HR must work alongside business\nleaders to implement for the organization to successfully meet the challenges\nof the 4IR. These include developing new\n[leadership](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrleadership/) capabilities;\nmanaging the integration of technology in the workplace; enhancing the\n[employee experience](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/);\nbuilding an [agile](https://hrexecutive.com/agile-organizations-need-\nleadership-not-management/) and personalized learning culture; establishing\nmetrics for valuing human capital; and embedding inclusion and diversity.\n\nFor HR to execute on these six imperatives, Jesuthasan says, the function will\nneed to develop a \u201cmuch better\u201d decision-making framework. Increasingly, that\nwill require HR to develop new data and analytic skills, as they assume new\nroles within the function.\n\n\u201cTheir own understanding of technology is critical, as they look out across\nthe changing world of technology to figure out what are the new technologies,\nhow are they applicable to both the work of HR and the work of the\norganization, and what does it mean for the human work that is currently being\ndone or that might be done in the future,\u201d says Jesuthasan.\n\nJulie Cook Ramirez is a Rockford, Ill.-based journalist and copywriter\ncovering all aspects of human resources.

Payroll management is an integral part of the company\nand it needs to remain in the best shape. A lot of companies believe in\noutsourcing their payroll to achieve the best results.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834a727bc9a.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nPayroll management is more than just scheduling out paychecks. With modern\ntechnologies shaping the human resources department, here is a look at how the\npayroll trends are evolving in 2020 and how you can effectively adapt to them.\n\n### **Automate Your Payroll**\n\nThis era of digital industrialization emphasizes the importance of automation.\nIt\u2019s not just the product lineup that you should be automating. Everything\nfrom sending out newsletters to sending out paychecks is also under a dire\nneed of automation.\n\nManual payroll has almost come to a halt and there are hardly any companies\nout there where someone is personally moving out to hand the employees their\nmonthly compensation. Automation has several advantages over traditional\nmethods, which are:\n\n  * Automated payroll is less prone to errors when compared to manual payroll. The calculations involved can be intense when it has to be done manually.   \n\n  * Automation makes the payroll process extremely fast and efficient. It is known to reduce payroll time significantly.   \n\n  * Timekeeping can be done efficiently which includes the calculation of compensation given to each employee depending on the hours they have dedicated. This will include overtime payment and deduction in the case of time shortage. With automated timekeeping systems like biometric or RFID, the chances of errors are reduced to almost nil.   \n\n  * Automation can also be cost-effective in many cases. If the number of employees of a company involved with payroll management is plenty, an automation [system](https://paybooks.in/payroll-management-system-features/) can definitely prove to be cheaper and faster.   \n\n  * Automation will also avoid any kind of delays. No delays will ensure the employees are always happy and don\u2019t have to go through any extra trouble because of something that\u2019s not their fault. \n\n###  \n**Keep a Track of Your Employees and Improvise**\n\n  \nIdentifying the top talent in a company and retaining them is the key to\nkeeping the company ranking high up the charts in all indices. Continuous\nmonitoring of data is the best way to analyze the performance metrics of each\nemployee and compensating them appropriately.\n\nThere are many **SaaS** agencies that help with people\u2019s analytics and data-\ndriven decisions to make the best of the available resources.\n\n  * Data Analytics is a growing field and can be used in payroll management as well. The data such as target completion and leaves taken can be collected through automated systems  \n\n  * Tracking Key Performance Indicators has been identified as one of the most important things to better understand your employees and compute various data related components like processing time per cycle, incomplete payments and the possible errors that might occur.   \n\n  * While tracking is the key, constant improvement is needed to make the best of it. The best thing to do is to merge similar processes to give the best to your employees. For example, HR and payroll need to be unified, otherwise, each process going on in one corner is going to make things very inefficient.   \n\n  * **Outsourcing** the analytics needs can be one of the best possible solutions to overcome the problem because hiring in house analytics team can sometimes be costlier and not be feasible for some small companies. \n\n  \n**Learn More:[How Faster Payments Are Impacting the Future of\nWork](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-administration/how-\nfaster-payments-are-impacting-the-future-of-work/)**\n\n### **Step up the Security**\n\nUndoubtedly, security and safety is the most important parameter in the age\nwhere cybercrimes have become so common. Luckily, this year\u2019s focus is going\nto be on the safety of the payroll data and this is being commonly employed in\nvarious companies.\n\n  * The payroll software and tools available are fairly secure as they are password protected and have various levels of encryption to ensure nobody can breach it. \n  * Automated security also means there are no papers that can be left lying around and the risk of it getting into the hands of the wrong person is completely eliminated. \n  * Since the system will make sure that no double entry is present, the account of the company is safe and any losses in terms of duplicate transactions cannot take place. \n  * **SaaS** makes sure that any payroll software provided to a company is void of defects and cannot be broken into. \n\n  \nWhile these trends are what is expected in the upcoming year, nobody can be\n100% sure about the future and that\u2019s why adaptability is very important. All\nsystems and tools that are being used should be interoperable and flexible to\nadapt to upcoming technology.\n\nStaying close to these trends is going to be one of the best things for the\npayroll management of your company and you can enter the new year prepared\nwith the best of knowledge.\n\n**Learn More:[Rewarding Human Capital Management (HCM) with

management, integrity improves, along with\nstandardization, transparency and ultimately, process design.\n\nBy: [Paul Bartlett](https://hrexecutive.com/author/paul-bartlett/ \"Posts by\nPaul

looking for continuous process improvements\nand new ways to enhance organizational effectiveness. It\u2019s an evergreen topic\nand one that deserves ongoing consideration and attention. Markets fluctuate,\ncompetitive pressures necessitate constant change and business goals evolve.\nPerhaps nowhere is this more apparent than within human resources, a critical\ncorporate function constantly challenged with demonstrating its value and\nmeasuring what matters. Factor in global presence and the imperative grows\neven taller, as HR teams seek to orchestrate their activities across time\nzones, language barriers and local labor laws. All the while, payroll tackles\nsimilar challenges, working diligently to satisfy country-specific\nrequirements and ensure employees get paid accurately and on-time. Two\nseemingly separate needs, both handling workforce information day in and day\nout, maintaining and updating records, managing requests, and ultimately,\npromoting a positive employee experience across the board.\n\nDepending on the project, HR and payroll spend an excessive number of hours\ncoordinating data collection and verification, making adjustments,\ncalculations and transferring information as needed. Even organizations in the\nU.S. with enterprise solutions in place, struggle to automate across global\nlocations, relying instead on manual updates and spreadsheets and resulting in\nmore mistakes and higher costs back to the employer. Historically, it seemed\nimpossible to share workflows, and as a result, the HR and payroll landscape\nbecame increasingly fractured and decentralized, unable to bridge the divide \u2013\nuntil recently.\n\n**Revisiting product**\n\nToday, advanced technologies allow for the movement of data around the globe\nthrough automation across the cloud. With the shift towards digital\ntransformation, comes the opportunity to simplify and streamline systems\nthrough integration \u2013 but change happens slowly, as evidenced by last year\u2019s\n[Payroll Operations Survey from\nDeloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/human-\ncapital/articles/payroll-operations-survey.html), which showed only 6% of\ncompanies use robotics as part of their processing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nThere remains an amazing amount of information available that no one ever\nthought to get from the other, and a unified, automated approach between HR\nand payroll makes it possible to review and refresh what already exists while\ngathering anything missing. At the same time, recent regulations, such as\nGDPR, put new guidelines and restrictions in place, reinforcing the need for a\nfresh look. From a data security perspective, integrations enable teams to\nmonitor the access to and movement of data from a single source, as opposed to\nmany. In the case of one multinational financial services company, integration\nand automated workflows reduced reliance on manual interventions, improved\nreporting, and maintained compliance that meets regional standards while\nproviding significant process improvements.\n\nWith a global, unified platform, people and processes work collectively,\nmanaging both the day-to-day and unexpected tasks in real-time. Shared\nworkflows open up collaboration and communication, regardless of location,\nremoving the guesswork for scheduling and using built-in functionality for\nreporting and validations. Once the current workload becomes integrated and\nautomated, incremental activities get built on top of that base, contributing\nto improved efficiency and outcomes.\n\n**Unifying people**\n\nThere is no doubt that technology serves as the core of any integration, in\nthis instance, with the tools and automation embedded on a global basis,\nrather than country by country. But there is another critical factor to\nconsider in achieving these workflows because beyond the immediate\nstakeholders is the impact of HR and payroll have on the employee experience.\nFreeing up the tedium associated with disparate systems, HR and payroll\nprofessionals offload the process-heavy tasks and focus more on meaningful\ninitiatives \u2013 reinvigorating their roles and responsibilities and bringing\ninspiration and innovation to the organization.\n\nFor the multinational mentioned above, integration worked to centralize\npayroll data across jurisdictions, adding authorization and validation online\nwhile eliminating the need for different providers, forms, and documentation.\nAs a result of simplification and automation, the teams introduced online\npayslips and offered employees the opportunity to use self-service tools to\nmaintain personal data.\n\nWithout the stress of each country\u2019s run deadlines and the looming threat of\nerrors, payroll can build out and introduce new options like payroll cash\nadvances to help employees in between paychecks. On the HR side, having access\nto [global payroll](https://www.cloudpay.net/) data boosts visibility across\nthe workforce and supports internal recruitment and talent mobility programs \u2013\nat a time when [PwC sees a 50% increase in international\nassignments](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/managing-tomorrows-people/future-of-\nwork/pdf/talent-mobility-2020.pdf) on the horizon. Through integration, the\ncapabilities of HR and payroll expand, linking the two with employer brand\nmanagement while workers benefit as well, signaling a win-win for the\norganization.\n\n**Harmonizing process**\n\nOf course, as executives know all too well, there is always new and more work\nto do. What serves the organization today may not tomorrow, and HR and payroll\nneed to remain agile. [Deloitte refers to this mindset as\n\u201charmonizing\u201d](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/mergers-\nacqisitions/us-ma-using-integration-to-catalyze-hr-transformation.pdf) rather\nthan the more frequently used \u201coptimizing,\u201d noting that \u201cA transformative\nintegration \u2026 may identify opportunities to more efficiently deliver HR\nservices, including technology-enabled improvements and process redesign.\u201d\nHaving already touched upon improvements to service delivery, the focus shifts\nto process, which underpins the success of the product and the people involved\nwith HR and payroll.\n\nOften, through a series of workflows engines or mapping, metadata about the\nprocess gets captured, indicating where inefficiencies take place and offering\na clear line of sight into potential improvements. An instance of this\nhappening might involve first-time approval rates and the effectiveness of\nmoving HR data into the payroll process. By analyzing the success of the task,\nHR and payroll learn about the accuracy of existing data as well as anything\nmissing that would be required for future runs. No surprise that same\nmultinational now sees a payroll accuracy rate of 99.99% while bringing cost\nsavings across functions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nAs this practice progresses, with HR and payroll updating and automating as\nneeded, the organization gains more profound insights into the overall\nefficiency of its integrations and shared workflows. Through better data\nmanagement, integrity improves, along with standardization, transparency and\nultimately, process design, leading HR and payroll teams to harmonious,\nproductive co-habitation.\n\nThe HR and payroll markets continue to innovate and enhance all aspects of\nworkforce management, and with that, so must global employers. The rapid\nadvancement of automation, integration and workflows correspond directly with\nan organization\u2019s capacity to adapt and adopt quickly in the future. Like the\nemployee experience, digital transformation never stops, and the ability to\nintegrate HR and payroll offers global organizations the chance to evolve with\nworkforce needs in near real-time, positively impacting their product, process\nand people.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fshaping-\nhr-effectiveness-through-shared-workflows%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Shaping+HR+effectiveness+through+shared+workflows&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fshaping-\nhr-effectiveness-through-shared-workflows%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fshaping-\nhr-effectiveness-through-shared-workflows%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Essentially, gathering and assessing people analytics\nleads to better decision-making through the application of statistics and\nother data interpretation techniques.\n\nSmarter, more strategic, and data-backed talent decisions are thus closer at\nhand, and this is applicable throughout the employee lifecycle \u2013 from making\nbetter hiring decisions and more effective performance management to better\nretention.\n\nPeople analytics has evolved considerably from when it was first used in\norganizations in the mid-1900s. There has been a clear transition from\nprescriptive analytics to predictive analytics, with which organizations can\nnow be better prepared to face the dynamism of their operational environment\nand be proactive rather than reactive. For example, sophisticated data\nscience, interactive data visualization, and machine learning \u2013 all integral\nparts of people analytics today \u2013 were nowhere a part of the process until a\nfew decades ago.\n\n## **The Process of People Analytics**\n\nPeople analytics today is a lot more intuitive and predictive. With that\nexpectation to live up to, the process involves the following steps.\n\n![The Process of People Analytics](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **Step 1: Dig data that matters**\n\n  \nThe core question to ask here is, \u201cWhat data is relevant to our business\ngoals?\u201d\n\nand to set the key performance indicators (KPIs) accordingly. This allows you\nto save major resources by only investigating areas that need direct\nmonitoring, such as operational tasks within the people management spectrum,\nand can lead to tangible business success.\n\nIf it does not add strategic value, digging that data could be a waste of\ntime. Knowing what to focus on also helps in applying the right statistics,\ndata mining, machine learning, survey management, and strategic workforce\nmanagement tools.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n### **Step 2: Experiment, explore, enrich**\n\n  \nIn a crowded and visibly fragmented market, it is imperative to choose a\npeople analytics tool by exploring the market, experimenting with different\noptions, and analyzing which option would enrich the organization the most.\nMultiple offerings include data mining, data transformation, and data\nvisualization techniques, all merged into a user-friendly self-service\ninterface.\n\nPlatforms that offer a wide range of features often require a lot of manual\nmanipulation to access important data, and these aspects can be tested only\nthrough systematic experimentation.\n\n### **Step 3: Have an action plan ready**\n\n  \nOnce you know what your end goal is, which data is relevant, and what the\navailable options are (based on clear pros vs. cons analysis), create an\naction plan. Applying big data and predictive analytics to **[talent\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/)** , leadership development, and organizational capabilities often\nhelps in fine-tuning the action plan.\n\nMoreover, having a well-defined plan of action enables a better understanding\nof why certain changes may be taking place and where the organization is\nheaded and can thus help garner more stakeholder support.\n\n### **Step 4: Avoid legal loopholes**\n\n  \nEnsuring that legal compliance is maintained in the collection of all data is\ncrucial. Before you start on the analytics project, have a legal team validate\nthe data sourcing techniques and processes. It does not end here.\n\nOnce the raw data has been gathered and treated, the results gleaned need to\nbe approved as well before they can be applied or published. In our digital\necosystem, with data protection and privacy laws still evolving, it is prudent\nto keep abreast of the changes and double-check on legal compliance.\n\n### **Step 5: Create leaner systems**\n\n  \nIrrespective of the complexity of the project at hand, the broader strategy\nthat the processes must adhere to needs to be simple and lean. The basic\nprocess of data analysis and interpretation should allow for easy application,\nupdating, and readability.\n\nFor example, create the basic outline simplified as intake and design (data\ncollection and the design of the analysis), data cleaning (removing irrelevant\nor unreliable data), data analysis (quantitative and qualitative exploration),\nand sharing insights (interpretation and presentation of the data). This can\nhelp avoid unnecessary complications such as confusion about the flow of steps\ninvolved, time wastage, or repetition of sub-processes that occur with\nunstandardized process structures, while still allowing room for tweaks where\nnecessary.\n\nThe idea is to find the right balance between the limited moving parts (people\nand the dynamism of the environment) and fluid, customizable systems and\nprocesses of people analytics. When you have the right team with the relevant\nskillset in place, it is easier to streamline the whole process and apply\nquality controls.\n\n### **Step 6: Build a fact-based, measurable HR business strategy**\n\n  \nA realistic HR business strategy avoids functional silos and can align talent\nto business seamlessly. Having clear KPIs and ROI expectations from people\nanalytics endeavors ensures that the impact is measured often and with\ntransparency. A winning strategy needs to be backed by data and an effective\nplan of action.\n\n### **Step 7: Take tech support**\n\n  \nTechnology is interspersed with every aspect of life today and more so with\nprocesses like people analytics, where often a bulk of analytical data is to\nbe treated with little or no room for error. New-age HR tech tools make real-\ntime data easily accessible. And this is an opportunity that needs to be\nmilked because today, agility and real-time intelligence can truly set you\napart from the competition.\n\n## **Four Key People Analytics Trends**\n\nSince people analytics relies heavily on evolving data-mining technologies and\ndata-interpretation strategies, the trends around people analytics develop in\ntime to the same. Here are the top 4 trends that are shaping people analytics\nin itself and how it interacts with the business. Some trends work in a dual\nloop \u2013 they affect people analytics and in turn, all other aspects of HR.\n\n![Four Key People Analytics Trends](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **1\\. Transforming what HR is and does**\n\n  \nBersin research points out that a meager 2% of HR organizations have mature\npeople analytics competence to bank on. There is thus quite a heavy first-\nmover advantage for innovative, intelligent organizations that are trying to\ntap into this space.\n\nWith people analytics changing how recruitment is conducted, how performance\nis measured, how compensation is planned or growth is mapped, and how learning\nand retention can be managed better, people analytics is quickly changing how\nHR operates.\n\nAccording to recent studies by Deloitte, increasing job offer acceptance\nrates, reducing HR help tickets, and optimizing compensation are just a few\nways in which people analytics is quickly becoming the new currency of HR.\nMoreover, with HR processes evolving to keep pace with business needs, people\nanalytics is moving from being a one-time initiative to becoming a real-time,\neasily modifiable tool that HR has immense benefits to draw from.\n\n### **2\\. Transforming HR business interactions**\n\n  \nWith recent trends in the work ecosystem, the interaction between HR and\nbusiness stakeholders (both internal and external) has been undergoing a\ntransformation as well. People analytics needs to change in keeping with the\nlatest trends in leadership. More transparency is a key trend emerging here,\nand intelligent insight is the need of the hour.\n\nBusinesses today need to be able to make sense of seemingly unrelated data\nstreams and find meaning, correlation, and maybe even interdependence between\none or more factors to predict and manage work better. People analytics has\nthe potential to provide actionable recommendations to enable strategic\nplanning and execution processes.\n\n### **3\\. Transforming the HR-employee relationship**\n\n  \nEmployee expectations today are consumer-grade. People analytics is providing\norganizations with the ramp to upgrade the **[employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience/)**. Every interaction that a candidate or an employee\nhas with an organization is a data point and could be utilized to glean\ninteresting insights. The idea is the need to transform the relationship that\nthe HR has with employees \u2013 to help HR become and be perceived as more than\njust a support function.\n\n### **4\\. Transforming the quality of insights**\n\n  \nThe quality of insights that are expected on a daily basis has changed over\nthe course of the last couple of years. People analytics can live up to these\nexpectations if you focus on two key aspects: analytics literacy and data\nsecurity.\n\nMore employees will need to become analytics literate to decrease dependence\non technical staff and to allow more perspectives to flourish. As people\nanalytics becomes a staple at organizations, data integrity and data security\nwill need to be upgraded and maintained for all listening channels and pulse\nchecks.\n\nWe discussed legal compliance, but data security should ideally go deeper than\nthat and become a cultural trait within the organization rather than being\nsuperficial check just for the sake of being compliant.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Talent Acquisition Specialist: 10 Key Skill Requirements\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-specialist-key-skill-requirements/)**\n\n## **Three Key Level-based Checks to Choose the Right People Analytics Tools**\n\nWith a vast array of available vendors, options, and subscription plans,\nchoosing the right people analytics tools can often seem like a rather\ndaunting task. Here\u2019s a three-level need-based check to make the right\ndecision.\n\n### **Level 1: A working HR dashboard**\n\n  \nTo get started with people analytics, use a basic dashboard that allows you to\ncapture, aggregate, and visualize data.\n\nTools like Power BI, Tableau, and Qlik allow ease of use and ease of data\naccess. With a level 1 requirement, your priority should be to keep your\npeople analytics system as simple as possible.\n\n### **Level 2: An insightful HR dashboard**\n\n  \nYou may have a steady dose of relevant data and need basic insights to analyze\nbetter and make stronger decisions. Statistical tools like Excel or SPSS are\neffective as well, though they may not come with quirky visual aids and\nsocial-media style interfaces. Tools like Visier, while taking some time to be\nset up, come with holistic analytics solutions.\n\n### **Level 3: A predictive HR dashboard**\n\n  \nYour organization is at the third requirement level when you seek not only to\nanalyze data but also to make intuitive predictions based on upcoming trends.\nThese tools help you study behavior in a way that you can predict the next\ncourse of action.\n\nFor example, there might be some correlation between your employees updating\ntheir LinkedIn page, taking frequent leaves, and with them not being very\ncontent at work. While this is a very simplistic situation, predictive tools\ncould help you make connections with behavior and decision patterns that you\nmight have missed otherwise.\n\nPython or RStudio can help with advanced analyses for large quantities of\ndata, though they might require you to hire data scientists specialized in the\nfield.\n\n## **Update, Upgrade, and Upskill for Smarter People Analytics**\n\nWith the latest people analytics and workforce analytics solutions, you can\ndelve deeper into the behavioral aspects of work, understand the cause-effect\nrelationship between different human and non-human aspects at work, and make\nbetter decisions.\n\nThe three points to remember are to know what data you need to quantify and\nqualify, to understand what the latest trends are, and to know what your end\ngoals are. Enabling your HR to update, upgrade, and upskill their knowledge\nand capabilities will ensure that your organization optimizes the latest\npeople analytics offers and can ride the latest trend waves towards a smarter,\nhappier workforce.\n\n_What people analytics trends do you predict for 2020?

Priya\nSunil\")\n\n## 3 reasons why your employees in Singapore might consider a new job\n\nHuman Resources magazine and the HR Bulletin daily email newsletter:  \nAsia's only regional HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\nSalary and compensation, work-life balance, and job security - these are the\ntop three factors candidates in Singapore consider when looking to join a\ncompany today.\n\nIn particular, [_JobStreet.com 's_ just-released _Laws of Attraction_\nrecruitment survey](https://www.jobstreet.com.sg/en/cms/employer/laws-of-\nattraction/), of more than 7,000 job seekers across 20 industries, found that\n16.6% of respondents valued salary and compensation, while 13.7% valued work-\nlife balance and 11.4% sought job security.\n\nWith this new direction, job seekers are placing lesser emphasis on what were\nonce considered the most important deciding factors of a job - future\nprospects, employee benefits, as well as the management and culture of the\norganisation.\n\n### Industries with the highest expectations for salary increments\n\nIn terms of salary and compensation, employees still consider attractive\nsalary packages as an important criterion when accepting a job offer. In fact,\na significant number of candidates expected to receive higher salaries when\nswitching job roles.\n\nIn line with that, candidates in the following industries had \"even higher\"\nexpectations towards salary increments:\n\n  * **Retail and merchandise** - 26.6%\n  * **Food & beverage/catering/restaurant **- 26.1%\n  * **Advertising/media/public relations** - 25.7%\n\nInterestingly, while this is so, Generation Z candidates (aged 18 to 23) have\nrevealed a different view - they would favour exciting career development\nopportunities, modern working environments, and socially responsible companies\nover salary and compensation.\n\n### Senior management expects to be compensated for overtime work\n\nAccording to the survey, work-life balance was considered a \"relatively\nimportant\" factor for respondents who held key roles in their organisations.\n\nAdditionally, about three in 10 (31%) \"firmly believe\" in getting compensation\nfor any overtime work, be it in overtime pay or off-in-lieu.\n\n**Chew Siew Mee, Country Manager, JobStreet.com Singapore** , explains:\n\"Senior management members are the ones who shoulder heavy job\nresponsibilities and work around the clock, but this group of employees is\nusually exempted from overtime compensation.\n\n\"What this survey has revealed is that companies must make sure to reward\nemployees \u2013 no matter their job positions \u2013 for work done out of official\nhours. An occasional time-off or flexibility to work from home can go a long\nway in showing the companies' appreciation.\"\n\nApart from this, the survey also found that job seekers in the education and\ntraining, as well as healthcare/medical sectors - two sectors that are set to\ngrow, were more concerned about work-life balance.\n\nIn view of these results, what then constitutes work-life balance to these\ncandidates?\n\nA five-day work week and an entitlement to a sufficient number of paid\nholidays, according to half (50%) of those surveyed. In fact, some respondents\nwished to have more control over their leave entitlements, and would most\ndesire 18 to 19 days of annual leave.\n\nAt the same time, slightly more than four in 10 (44%) said they would not\nconsider a job offer if it required irregular hours or shift work.\n\n### Job security is growing in importance among older job seekers\n\nIn terms of job security, this factor was common across all generations,\nthough more prevalent among Generation X (12.6%) and the Baby Boomers (12%).\nGeneration Y and Generation Z, on the other hand, were slightly less concerned\nwith this factor (9.9% and 10.2% respectively).\n\nWhile this is so, 44% of respondents across generations would prefer to be\nemployed by an established and financially-secure company.\n\nLastly, across job levels, mid-level management holders were most concerned\nwith job securities while, on the contrary, those in their first jobs were\nleast concerned, preferring to prioritise their breadth of work experience.\n\n_Photo /[iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/sg)_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

Employers that\ngather and submit this data have an opportunity to address pay equity issues\nand to ensure their pay practices are operating as intended.\n\nAddressing Inequity  \n\n\"People think they are being fair,\" said Jamie Press, senior vice president of\nhuman resources for payroll provider Prime Pay in West Chester, Pa. \"But the\nfirst step toward pay equity requires taking a look at actual numbers and the\neffects of an organization's pay practices.\"  \n\nSuch a review is not just a step toward greater fairness; it could also help\nemployers avoid uncomfortable disclosures about their pay practices.\n\n\"Employers should expect that [EEO-1] data will become public,\" said Denise\nVisconti, a shareholder with law firm Littler Mendelson in San Diego. \"This is\nnot just about the EEOC and public getting the data. Individual states could\naccess the data to enforce pay equity requirements and laws now or in the\nfuture.\"\n\nAlthough the first round of EEO-1 reporting focused on older data from 2017\nand 2018, employers can still analyze that data and learn from it. For pay\ndifferences in gender, race and ethnicity, ask, \" 'Do these differences still\nexist in 2019 data, and, if so, can you explain them?' \" Visconti advised. \"If\nyou can't, it's time to address them.\"\n\nShe also urged employers to prepare for any questions the EEOC may ask about\nthe data. This is the time to identify legitimate business reasons for any\noddities or potential problem areas, using footnotes to provide context.\n\nIf a review reveals unequal pay, that's another challenge for employers, and\nexecutives will need to consider the potential risks of being sued.\n\nPay equity problems can exist in any part of an organization. That is why it's\nimportant to evaluate pay practices and outcomes at all levels of the\ncompany\u2014from each manager's group to the organization as a whole. This\nincludes \"making sure performance evaluations are free of unconscious bias,\"\nsaid Press.\n\nHR has a key role to play by providing facts about existing pay and\nperformance-evaluation practices, setting up training for managers who are\nfalling short when it comes to fairly assessing employee performance, and\nmaking sure the entire system operates consistently and fairly.\n\n_[SHRM members-only toolkit : _ [ _Managing Pay\nEquity_](/TemplatesTools/Toolkits/Pages/ManagingPayEquity.aspx) _]_\n\nFind the Root Causes\n\nWhen examining pay data, look for pay differences among various groups or\nindividual employees with the same or similar jobs, then identify what drives\nthose differences. In some cases, problems could arise when those making pay\ndecisions are out of step with the organization's stated compensation\nphilosophy.\n\nFor instance, one employer was strongly against raising starting salaries for\nnew hires, fearing pay compression, which results when newer employees make\nmore than longer-tenured employees in the same position. \"However, a pay\nequity analysis showed that managers were still giving new hires [pay]\npremiums to join the organization,\" which, as feared, led to different pay\nlevels for new employees compared to the existing workforce, said Casey North,\na San Francisco-based principal with the workforce strategy and analytics\npractice at Mercer, an HR consultancy. Once pay becomes arbitrary, it can be\nharder to combat pay inequalities.\n\nIn another case, an organization's compensation philosophy was to have\nperformance weigh most heavily in pay decisions, with little to no\nconsideration for an employee's potential. In reality, however, managers were\nletting employee potential significantly affect their pay decisions.\n\nTo correct these types of issues, employers can conduct a thorough audit of\ncompensation practices to uncover problems and identify ways to address them.\n\"It is important to get your house in order,\" said Visconti. These audits can\nfocus on answering several key questions, such as:\n\n  * Is available data clean and robust enough to support a comprehensive compensation audit?  \n\n  * Do pay decisions reflect the company's pay philosophy?  \n\n  * How do median pay levels differ when compared to specific groups\u2014for example, median pay for men compared to that of women?  \n\n  * Are some employees earning bonuses for unexplained or inadequately documented reasons?  \n\n  * Is the compensation philosophy encouraging discrepancies in pay levels, or are discrepancies happening because managers are not adhering to the compensation philosophy?  \n\n  * If the goal is to pay for performance, is the organization actually paying for performance?\n\nWhen conducting a pay analysis, \"dig deeper to find out why any discrepancies\nare happening,\" North said. In the process, employers may find other issues\nnot based on compensation that need to be addressed to support pay equity. For\nexample, an analysis may show that men are more likely to hold jobs at a\nhigher level in some parts of the organization, which may indicate gender bias\nin promotions.\n\n_Joanne Sammer is a New Jersey-based business and financial writer._\n\n**Related SHRM Articles :**\n\n[Closing the Gender Pay Gap](/hr-today/news/hr-\nmagazine/summer2019/Pages/closing-the-gender-pay-gap.aspx), _HR Magazine_ ,\nJune 2019\n\n[U.S. Companies Are Working to Fix Pay-Equity Issues](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/compensation/pages/companies-are-working-to-fix-pay-equity-\nissues.aspx), _SHRM Online_ , May 2019  \n\n_Visit SHRM's resource page on _[_pay equity_](/ResourcesAndTools/Pages/Pay-\nEquity.aspx) _. _  \n\n[Pay Equity](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Pay Equity) [Critical\nEvaluation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Critical Evaluation)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Pay+Equity+Shines+Spotlight+on+Compensation+Alignment&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/compensation/Pages/pay-equity-shines-spotlight-on-compensation-\nalignment.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

This was followed by directors\nof compensation & benefits (a role with the potential to earn S$240,000 or\nmore per annum) and talent management experts (where professionals are able to\ntake home S$150,000 to S$240,000 per year).\n\nWhen it comes to contract roles, HR directors remain the highest earning, with\na monthly salary of S$18,000 to S$25,000; followed by directors of\nrecruitment/talent acquisition, with an earning potential of S$15,000 to\nS$20,000 a month. While directors of compensation & benefits came in third\nwith an expected monthly salary of S$15,000.\n\nThe survey also revealed that in the HR sector, professionals who are HR\nbusiness partners, able to acquire talent in tech, and work in the areas of\ntalent management and development, are expected be in strong demand in 2020.\n\nWith 73% of HR professionals having stayed more than two years in a role, the\nsurvey found that the top three drivers of job satisfaction were good working\nculture and environment; training and learning opportunities; as well as\nfeedback and encouragement from management.\n\nThat said, staying in a role comes with certain salary expectations. Almost\ntwo thirds expected a 0-6% annual salary increment, while 32% expected a 7-15%\nannual salary increment, and 4% expected a more than 15% annual salary\nincrement.\n\nHence, it comes as no surprise that better compensation & benefits (27%) was\namong the top four motivators to move jobs. Other motivators were: better\ncompany culture (36%), career progression (12%), improved work-life balance\n(12%).\n\nOn average, candidates moving jobs expected salary increments of 8-12%.\n\n###### Note: Open image in new tab to view full resolution.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/21110129/Robert-Walters-Salary-Survey-Singapore-\nHR.jpg)\n\n\n\nOverall, professionals staying in their jobs can expect 1-7% salary increments\nin 2020. While job movers can expect a 5-15% salary increase. Larger\nincrements are expected for candidates with niche skillsets, such as in\ntechnology & transformation, banking and financial services, legal, sales &\nmarketing, supply chain, procurement and logistics.\n\nSteady hiring activity is expected in Singapore, despite the economic slowdown\nduring 2019. Top skillsets in demand for the tech and transformation sector\nare change and digital transformation, agile and devops, and business acumen.\n\nThe survey also revealed that contracting roles are expected to rise as\nperceptions around contract and interim roles change, and job seekers are more\nopen to non-permanent roles that offer good learning opportunities and\nexposure.\n\n_Infographic / Robert Walters_  \n_Lead image /[iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/sg)_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

An HRIS is often referred to an\nHRMS (human resources management system) since it aids in effective human\nresource management and planning.\n\nAn HRIS includes under its umbrella a wide range of systems. For example, it\nincludes all aspects of managing the employee database and directory,\napplicant tracking, benefits administration, payroll processes, work\nscheduling, time and attendance, leaves tracking, electronic signatures,\ncompliance protocols, customizable insight reports, employee self-service,\n**[performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)** , and HR processes taken care of on\nmobile apps.\n\nThis list, long as it may be, is not written in stone. It differs within both\nclient and vendor organizations based on the needs of the human capital that\nrequires to be managed, employee strength, the geographical spread of an\norganization, the basic protocols of functioning that it adheres to, and its\nmap for the future.\n\n**Learn More:[What is Human Capital Management (HCM)? Definition, Process,\nPlatforms (tools) with\nExamples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-human-capital-management/)**\n\n## **HRIS Processes and Working Components**\n\nAt present, all human resource functions are dealing with quite a data dump\nsince every interaction that a candidate or an employee has with the\norganization is captured and stored as data. A human resource information\nsystem thus becomes crucial in making sense of all this data \u2013 to not only\ncollect and store data effectively but to gather the information that would\nenable effective workflow and improve efficiency.\n\nMost HRIS solutions today offer customized systems based on the unique needs\nand growth plans of the organization. Let\u2019s take a peek into the six key HRIS\nprocesses and working components that most organizations require in some\ncombination.\n\n### **1\\. Database management**\n\n  \nThe core offering of most human resource information system solutions is a\nready-access database where all employee information can be stored and managed\neffectively. The HR team (or anyone managing the portal) can easily input all\npersonnel data into the system. The point is to be able to access all this\ndata and relevant metric from it on demand from anywhere across the globe.\n\nThe kind of data stored on the system ranges from compensation information,\nemergency contact details, and education history to present contact\ninformation, learning metrics, and performance review scores. The database\nforms the heart of all HR functions and could prove to be an effective online\nor cloud-hosted backup for a largely paperless office.\n\n### **2\\. Time and labor management**\n\n  \nMonitoring the clocking hours of every single employee is a time-intensive\ntask. With a majority of offices today allowing employees to either punch in\nbiometrically or log on to input their own hours, this daily dose of data\nneeds effective management.\n\nManagers can now approve leave requests, and the data can be directly linked\nto payroll. A non-intrusive but efficient human resource information system\ncan thus keep a close tab on punctuality and attendance.\n\n**Learn More:[What is People Management? Complete Process with Best\nPractices](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-people-management/)**\n\n### **3\\. Payroll functions**\n\n  \nPayroll is one of the most important functions of HR. With a lean human\nresource information system allowing easy download or upload of employee hours\nand attendance data, the number crunch can be made a lot simpler, and deposits\nto employees made more seamless. This also leads to fewer errors by reducing\nhuman intervention. Moreover, most HRIS payroll software lead to an\nimprovement in tax compliance, especially for organizations that deal with\nmultiple tax levels.\n\n### **4\\. Benefits management**\n\n  \nBenefits management does not pertain only to medical benefits and retirement\ninvestments, but all queries, feedback, data, and communication related to\nbenefits. Such applications provide a one-stop platform experience for all\nemployers and employees alike, add transparency, and enable smoother\noperations.\n\nEvery employee is affected by the benefits regulations and strategy, and how\nthat is managed affects the total experience that the employee has at work.\n\n### **5\\. Employee interface**\n\n  \nMost human resource information system software allows limited user access to\nemployees, but even that moderate level of employee self-service is a step\nforward in creating a culture where employees have more operational freedom.\nThe interface that allows employees to update their personal information,\nreview pay scales, change retirement benefit programs, update direct deposit\ninformation or download benefit election documents needs to provide a user\nexperience that is easy, integrated, and time-saving.\n\n### **6\\. Talent acquisition and retention**\n\n  \nAcquiring and retaining the right talent is how an organization can hope to\ngrow. With that context in mind, recruitment and retention are crucial\ncomponents of any HRIS and are ranked by most organizations as must-have\nfeatures.\n\nGetting the right talent onboard is just the first step to the talent puzzle.\nEmployees also need to be provided with the right training, career pathing,\nand reward plans to enable growth, boost morale, and create job happiness.\nHRIS tools can improve the candidate experience while also making it easier\nfor recruiters to source, track, and engage with the right talent.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Talent Acquisition Specialist: 10 Key Skill Requirements\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-specialist-key-skill-requirements/)**\n\n## **HRIS Models**\n\nNow that we have had a glance at the systems and working components that move\nthe human resource information system machinery, let\u2019s dig into the HRIS\nmodels that guide the functioning of its processes.\n\n### **1\\. Input and output model of a basic HRIS**\n\n  \nThis model enumerates the basic functioning of an HRIS \u2013 from input to output.\nBoth environmental and internal sources provide data for the input subsystems,\nwhich are then interpreted into information and used in recruiting, workforce\nplanning, workforce/[talent\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/), compensation, benefits, and for various parts of the reporting\nchannel.\n\n![Input and output model of a basic HRIS](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 1. Input and output model of a basic HRIS_**\n\n### **2.** **Model for HRIS adoption**\n\n  \nWith a plethora of options available in the market (to the point where the\nmarket seems overcrowded), choosing the right HRIS is a big decision. But once\nthat is done, to ensure that the organization has invested in a winning\nsystem, the right adoption of the HRIS is necessary. Here\u2019s a model that\nenumerates the different aspects of adopting the right HRIS and adapting to\nnew processes.\n\n![HRIS adoption model](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 2.

HRIS success model**\n\n  \nThe following figure is the integrated HRIS model for success. This is to\nreiterate how the users\u2019 perception of the system is affected by the quality\nof system processes, information access and application, ease of use, and\nusefulness.\n\nThe perceived utility of the HRIS is an interesting factor since it is quite\nsubjective and must make sense to the employee. All these factors together\ncontribute to the level of user satisfaction and ultimately to the success of\nthe HRIS.\n\n![HRIS success model](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 3.

to just-published findings, the most in-demand HR roles for 2020 in\nHong Kong will be in business partnering, learning & development, employee\nengagement and compensation & benefits.\n\nA total of 45% of HR professionals in Hong Kong will be looking to change jobs\nin 2020 \u2013 while 64% expect to remain in a role for 3-5 years.\n\nThese are the key takeaways from a comprehensive report by Robert Walters that\nanalyses salaries across all sectors, while taking the pulse of all countries\nacross the region.\n\nScroll down for the full 2020 salary guide for Hong Kong HR professionals.\n\nThe report also revealed that the top four motivating factors for HR\nprofessionals are better C&B (73%), better company culture (48%), career\nprogression (45%) and improved work-life balance (38%).\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/03122406/HR-salary-guide_HK.png)\n\n\u201cHR business partners with previous transformation experience and employer\nbranding expertise are expected to be in high demand for talent attraction and\nretention,\u201d said Ricky Mui, managing director for Robert Walters, Hong Kong.\n\nOffering advice on recruitment trends for next year, Mui added: \u201cWith niche\nskills in short supply and candidates cautious about moving roles in 2020,\nhiring managers need to be decisive about the attributes they are looking for,\nensuring an efficient and well-communicated hiring process.\n\n\u201cIn a period where salary budgets are tight, companies need to demonstrate to\ncandidates, the presence of a positive workplace culture where flexible\nworking, workspace design and digital technology all play an important role.\u201d\n\nIn terms of Hong Kong\u2019s top HR earners for 2020, HR directors in a permanent\nrole in the finance sector boasted the biggest annual salary, with an expected\nrange of HK$1.2\u20131.8 million \u2013 this is up from 2019\u2019s top end figure of HK$1.6\nmillion.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/03122507/HR-key-findings_HK-700x410.png)\n\n\n\n**Also read: [HR

somewhat different. A total of 81% of HR\nprofessionals expect to stay in a role for 3-5 years (higher than Hong Kong),\nwhile 38% of mainland HR professionals did not feel optimistic about job\nopportunities in the sector.\n\nThe most in-demand roles in China in 2020 are tipped to be business\npartnering, change management, talent acquisition and retention & development.\n\nIn terms of the biggest earners, mainland China has gazumped Hong Kong with a\nHR director in Shanghai predicted to earn an annual salary of up to 1.8\nmillion RMB, while a HR director in Beijing will be able to earn up to an\nenviable 3.0 million RMB annually.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/03122537/HR-salary-guide_Shanghai.png)\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/03122606/HR-salary-guide_Beijing-700x406.png)\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

HR Needs to Succeed \\(But Most Don't Have\nYet\\)](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/vmemkwn3huih8gp58eflaw.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * Your people are more of a competitive advantage than your tangible assets\n  * Leaders often blame HR for problems, but need to focus on lending better support\n  * Free up HR to focus on the employee experience, then hold them accountable\n\nThink about what these businesses have achieved:\n\n  * Uber >> the new taxi\n  * Airbnb >> the new hotel\n  * Google >> replacing encyclopedias, maps and more\n  * Amazon >> replacing brick-and-mortar stores\n\nWhat do they have in common?\n\nThey've succeeded without the traditional business assets of their industry.\n\nTheir use of technology and AI tore down historical barriers to entry --\nshowing that tangible business assets are becoming less and less of a\ncompetitive advantage. In fact, tangible assets have dropped in [S&P market\nvalue](http://www.oceantomo.com/blog/2015/03-05-ocean-tomo-2015-intangible-\nasset-market-\nvalue/?utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_259520&utm_medium=copy) from\n68% in 1985 to an average of 13% today.\n\nWhat does this mean for businesses? It means that focusing on your\n_intangible_ assets is your best chance for achieving organic growth and\nhigher market value today. And HR leads the one intangible asset that's under-\nutilized more than any other: your people.\n\nGallup's recent research on [the employee\nexperience](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/242252/employee-experience.aspx)\nreveals that organizations rarely meet people's _basic needs_ at any stage of\nthe employee life cycle. Leaving only 15% of employees worldwide and 33% in\nthe U.S. engaged at work.\n\nIt might be hard to believe those numbers if you feel like your organization\nhas plenty of human resources systems in place, but organizations are still\nmissing the mark.\n\nMany leaders turn their gaze to HR when they notice that their people aren't\nproductive or when good employees quit -- but [a strong company culture -- the\ntype that keeps top employees](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/234893/groups-\nbreak-company-culture.aspx) \\-- starts with _leaders_.\n\nIn other words, your HR department might not be set up for success -- and they\ncan't be -- without your leadership support.\n\n**Here are the four things leaders can do to help HR get the best out of your\npeople:**\n\n### **1\\. Raise the expectations for results (so you can justify the\ninvestment).**\n\nIf [people are your company's biggest asset and you plan to invest in\nthem](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/258044/treat-people-assets-not-\nexpenses-invest.aspx), your organizational strategy and people strategy can't\nbe considered as two separate things.\n\nHR should bring their voice to your company's decision-making process -- _and_\nbe accountable for helping your organization get results.\n\nOften leaders budget HR as an expense, rather than an asset to invest in. But\ninstead of cutting costs, you can invest in your people strategies and then\nask HR for a clear connection on the return by tracking the right metrics.\n\nHR should bring their voice to your company's decision-making process -- and\nbe accountable for helping your organization get results.\n\nWhen held accountable, HR is liberated to find the right solutions to get\nbusiness outcomes.\n\n### **2\\. Empower them to make data-driven decisions in a realistic way.**\n\nTechnology that helps HR collect employee feedback and performance data is\nfinally becoming more readily available. But it's creating a new problem.\n\nHR has quickly gotten bogged down with too much data (often surface-level data\nat that) and without enough, or the right, guidance.\n\nIt's hard to make data-driven decisions based on numbers if you're not sure\nwhat the numbers mean. It's a mistake to invest in data collection technology\nif leaders aren't devising a strategy to go with it and empowering HR to use\nthe data correctly.\n\nIt's hard to make data-driven decisions based on numbers if you're not sure\nwhat the numbers mean.\n\nThis is why Gallup developed a new workplace platform. [Gallup\nAccess](https://www.gallup.com/access/) helps HR collect insights about\nemployees -- and it also highlights and teaches managers what to do next,\nafter the survey, to improve their team engagement and performance -- based on\ndecades of research.\n\nGallup paired research and surveys that help you measure your culture with\n[learning insights](https://www.gallup.com/access/239216/management-\nlearning.aspx) that allow you to understand the implications of the results\nand make decisions that achieve business outcomes.\n\n### **3\\. Free them from primarily focusing on tactical, compliance and\ncompensation issues.**\n\nIf you work in a matrixed organization, you know that cultivating the right\nemployee experience across cross-functional teams will take time and talent.\n\n_You must work proactively._\n\nInstead, what do a lot of HR teams say they spend their time on? Reacting to\nproblems that would diminish if they could only get ahead on their\ninitiatives.\n\nThey spend time helping others resolve interpersonal problems and navigating\noffice politics, and many ethical, legal, compliance, benefit and compensation\nissues, too.\n\nWhile HR should support or lead these issues on some level, figuring out which\nissues could be delegated to your legal and financial teams -- or even your\nteam managers -- and investing in technology that expedites tactical work\n(background checks, getting a corporate ID card, issuing computers, etc.) --\nwill free them up to focus on the big picture.\n\n### **4\\. Develop and invest in your people managers (because HR initiatives\nare limited without them).**\n\nYour managers, from the very top to the first-level manager, can create\nsuccess or disaster for an HR team working to optimize a company's most\nvaluable assets.\n\n**From[Gallup's recent research on\nmanagers](https://www.gallup.com/itsthemanager/):**\n\n> \"Nearly every problem and achievement in your organization can be tied back\n> to the quality of your managers.\n>\n> Why? Gallup has found that the role of the manager is a dominant factor in\n> the employee experience -- from onboarding and performance to development\n> and retention. _Managers account for an astounding 70% of the variance in\n> team engagement,_ and their efforts substantially impact the bottom line of\n> entire organizations.\n>\n> How your managers feel about your organization greatly influences how\n> everyone else feels about it. In other words, your _manager experience_\n> largely defines your employee experience.\"\n\nHR can provide all sorts of education, communication, data and analytics --\nbut they can't achieve anything without [developing and investing in the\nmanagers](https://www.gallup.com/learning/248357/leaders-managers.aspx) who\nare responsible for the daily engagement of every employee.\n\n### **HR 's success is the organization's success. But they can't do it\nalone.**\n\nGetting the best of your people and your business has always been a team\nsport. Perhaps the responsibilities have not been clear, though.\n\nOrganizations who set clear expectations and remove roadblocks for HR are the\nones who [achieve the kind of culture great employees want to be a part\nof](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/232682/culture-paper-2018.aspx).\n\nIn doing so, leaders are able to successfully manage the intangible assets of\ntheir business, directly influencing the majority of their market value.\n\n### **Learn more about how HR and leaders can work together to get business\nresults:**\n\n  * Explore Gallup's learning programs for [HR

But when\nyou distill it down to its essentials and understand how you need to pivot as\nan HR department to make it a priority, good things will happen, writes Brian\nWestfall, principal HR and talent management analyst at Capterra.**_\n\nDespite being part of the HR conversation for over 20 years, \u201ctalent\nmanagement\u201d\u2014like love and sandwiches\u2014remains frustratingly difficult to\ndefine. In 2020, every CEO and HR leader knows that talent management needs to\nbe a priority in order to run a successful business. But only those that truly\nunderstand the concept can turn it into a tangible strategy and technology\nstack.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nSo, what is talent management, really? How does it differ from what we\nunderstand as traditional HR? And what are the implications of these\ndifferences? Read on to find out.\n\n## **Talent Management Is Building a Workforce to Achieve Organizational\nGoals**\n\nBoiled down to its essence, talent management is your organization\u2019s strategy\nfor attracting, recruiting, retaining, and developing people. Seriously,\nthat\u2019s it.\n\nOf course, what sounds really simple on the surface is actually incredibly\ncomplex. Everything from recruiting and onboarding, to compensation,\nperformance, and employee training is part of talent management. Making\nmatters worse, there is no blueprint for talent management success. The talent\nmanagement strategy that works for a local diner won\u2019t work for a global IT\nfirm.\n\nNonetheless, the concept is always the same: Create a strategy for the success\nof the organization, then find and keep the best people to execute on that\nstrategy. That\u2019s talent management.\n\n## **Talent Management Is Not an Alternative to HR**\n\nPerhaps the biggest misconception I see about talent management is that it is\nan evolution of HR or an alternative approach to HR for modern times, like a\nfad diet or a new workout program. That\u2019s not the case.\n\nTalent management is just one increasingly important category of HR, but one\nthat has always been there, existing alongside three other categories: HR\nadministration, HR service delivery, and workforce management. Here\u2019s how they\nbreak down:\n\n  * **HR administration covers your traditional, back-office HR responsibilities.** This includes things like payroll and benefits administration, but also compliance, safety, and grievance tracking.  \n\n  * **HR service delivery is how you deliver information to workers.** Alongside ongoing case, document, and knowledgebase management, this category of responsibilities also includes maintaining HR channels, like the HRIS or the company intranet.  \n\n  * **Talent management is how you grow and maintain a competitive workforce.** It touches on any process pertaining to the attraction, recruitment, retention, or development of people.  \n\n  * **Workforce management is the optimization of talent resources.** Budgeting and forecasting fall here, but so does anything pertaining to scheduling and time and attendance.  \n\nAs it has become harder and harder to find and keep top talent, and as more\nbusinesses have prioritized their people as their most important competitive\nasset, it was inevitable that talent management would eventually garner the\nmost attention and focus on these categories.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say those other categories aren\u2019t important. But if your HR\ndepartment is still operating in a largely back-office role and struggling\nwith talent management (looking at you, small businesses), it\u2019s time to\nrethink your approach.\n\n**Learn More:[What Is Candidate Management? Definition, Relationship\nManagement, and Best\nPractices](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-management-definition-best-practices/)**\n\n## **3 Ways Talent Management Requires a Different Approach**\n\nTransitioning from a back-office role based on compliance to a seat at the\nleadership table-based around strategy isn\u2019t easy for an HR department. But\nwith [83% of HR\nleaders](https://content.randstadsourceright.com/hubfs/Global%20campaign/TTR/2019/report/Randstad-\nSourceright-2019-Talent-Trends-Report-190118.pdf) aiming to make a measurable\nimpact on business performance through their talent management strategy, it\u2019s\nnever been more important to make this shift if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nHere are three ways talent management requires a different approach:\n\n  1. **It takes a village**. Traditional HR is a largely siloed endeavor, but talent management is the opposite. Your CEO, your various department heads, and your IT team all play a role in talent management, which may require you to flatten your org structure or hire a chief people officer dedicated to talent management to close the distance between all of the stakeholders.  \n\n  2. **It requires thinking long-term**. Talent management requires asking big questions that don\u2019t have easy answers. How are you going to attract the best job seekers? How are you going to train people and help them grow? You won\u2019t be able to answer these questions in a week or even a month. Determine metrics for success, test different approaches, and, most importantly, be patient.  \n\n  3. **It needs updated technology.** Your core HR system can handle those day-to-day compliance needs, but what about your talent management needs? A talent management system provides more robust functionality to track data for everything from recruiting to performance management, employee engagement, succession planning, and more\u2014data that is vital to testing and making talent management decisions. These systems also automate a lot of rote tasks, like onboarding, so you can focus more time on that all-important strategy.\n\n  \nYour strategy should inform your technology needs, not the other way around.\nIf your current stack doesn\u2019t support your vision, it\u2019s time for an upgrade.\n\n## **Talent Management Is Here to Stay**\n\nIn HR, we\u2019re used to trends crashing down on us as the \u201cnext big thing,\u201d only\nto be replaced by the next \u201cnext big thing\u201d a few years later. For example,\nall the hype over employee productivity was overtaken by employee engagement,\nthen the employee experience. And remember all the fuss about blockchain?\n\nTalent management, on the other hand, is not fading away. It\u2019s the holistic\npeople strategy that will dictate the success of your business forever, and\nwill only make its impact more felt during the difficult times. If you\u2019ve yet\nto sit down with your stakeholders and map out a combination of structure,\nprocess, strategy, and technology to succeed at talent management, 2020 is the\nyear to start.\n\n**Learn More:[5 Best Talent Management Strategies for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/5-best-\ntalent-management-strategies-for-2020/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fdetermining-the-difference-between-talent-management-and-\nhr%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Determining+the+Difference+Between+Talent+Management+and+HR\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Determining+the+Difference+Between+Talent+Management+and+HR&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fdetermining-the-difference-between-talent-management-and-\nhr%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fdetermining-the-difference-between-talent-management-and-\nhr%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fdetermining-the-difference-between-talent-management-and-\nhr%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Determining the Difference Between Talent\nManagement and\nHR&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fdetermining-the-difference-between-talent-management-and-\nhr%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

satisfaction both deserve equal attention if\nyou are to maximize your workforce\u2019s potential and enable the growth of your\norganization. Read our primer to know about the difference between employee\nengagement and job satisfaction, as well as how they are intrinsically\nrelated._**\n\nDid you know that a staggering 41.4 million people in the U.S. left their jobs\nvoluntarily in 2018? This is 8.3% more than the previous year and 88% more\nthan at the start of this decade, according to the [2019 Retention Report by\nWork Institute](http://info.workinstitute.com/retentionreport2019).\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834cadce393.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nThis rate of voluntary turnover costs companies billions in lost productivity,\nrehiring, and retraining expenses every year.\n\nOne way to retain at least some number of employees is by addressing the\nissues of employee engagement and job satisfaction. The two are different, and\nlearning how they differ can help you keep your employees happy, motivated,\nand less likely to quit.\n\nAnd this has a massive impact: even a 10% reduction in voluntary turnover can\nsave U.S. companies $475 billion, says the Work Institute report mentioned\nabove.\n\nSo, how do employee engagement and **[job\nsatisfaction](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/job-\nsatisfaction-definition-factors-importance-statistics-examples/)** differ? Is\nyour assessment of these two metrics accurate? Let\u2019s find out.\n\n## **Table of Contents**\n\n  * **Employee Engagement and Job Satisfaction: Are They the Same?**\n  * **Factors Affecting Job Satisfaction**\n  * **Factors Affecting Employee Engagement**\n  * **How Do Employee Engagement Metrics Differ From Job Satisfaction Metrics?**\n  * **Employee Engagement and Job Satisfaction on Maslow\u2019s Pyramid**\n  * **Key Takeaways**\n\n##  \n**Employee Engagement and Job Satisfaction: Are They the Same?**\n\nTo identify the difference between these two areas, let\u2019s consider two types\nof employees.\n\nImagine a manufacturing employee, Nathan, who starts his shift at 9 AM every\nday and works until 5 PM with a one-hour lunch break in-between. He receives a\ncompetitive pay package, better than other manufacturing plants located in his\ncounty. It takes Nathan only 20 minutes to reach the plant, and he has been\nworking there for the last seven years. In this period, he has been promoted\ntwice. He also receives full medical coverage for himself and his family,\nwhich makes him worry less about the future.\n\nThese indicators suggest that Nathan is satisfied with his job. The job\nprovides everything he needs, and he has no complaints from it.\n\nNow consider Amanda, a software developer at a startup. The company is in the\nearly stages of growth, and Amanda has been offered equity benefits instead of\nstandard compensation elements until the first round of funding comes in.\nAmanda often spends over 10 hours in the office, trying to meet deadlines and\ngetting the product off the ground. She is passionate about her work and is\ncontinually learning new things in her domain, which makes her a highly\nskilled professional.\n\nAmanda\u2019s passion for her job and her desire to learn more about her work are\nindicators that she is highly engaged in her job, even though some of the\ntraditional satisfaction components are missing.\n\nWhat is important to note here, however, is that job satisfaction and employee\nengagement are both equally important. While satisfaction may be enough to\nsustain an employee in a job for seven years, it is engagement in the job that\nwill help employees reach their full potential and subsequently enable the\ngrowth of the organization. Only when your workforce is satisfied and engaged,\nyou can sustain productivity levels in the long run.\n\n### **Job Satisfaction**\n\n  \nJob satisfaction can be defined as the sense of contentment one feels as a\ndirect result of being employed in a particular role. It isn\u2019t only when the\nemployee is content while in the office/workplace \u2014 their job makes them feel\ncontent in life, impacting areas such as security and confidence. Job\nsatisfaction is a must-have if you want your employees to have a long tenure\nwith your company.\n\nConsidering Amanda\u2019s example above, she may be engaged. Still, unless the\ncompany receives funding and starts providing her with the pay commensurate\nwith her efforts, she is likely to start looking for a new job because the\nsatisfaction element may be missing.\n\n### **Employee Engagement**\n\n  \n**[Employee engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-engagement/)** can be defined as the level of\ninvolvement and connection one feels in their job. Various forces shape\nengagement, including the nature of leadership and the sense of community in\nthe workplace. There\u2019s also an individual factor in employee engagement \u2013 if\nyou placed Nathan in Amanda\u2019s role, he might not have experienced the same\nlevel of engagement. Motivation, interest, passion, purpose, and personal\ninvestment all make up how engaged an employee is.\n\nEngagement is what ensures that employees are part of a company\u2019s growth\ncurve. For example, if Nathan isn\u2019t engaged in his role at the manufacturing\nplant, he will feel there is no direct link between his job and the company\u2019s\nsuccess. Over time, this feeling could intensify, causing him to look for a\nmore meaningful employment option.\n\nThis is where you should note that engagement is also associated with\nemployees' personality type. Nathan's seven years at the job can be an\nindicator that for him, the security that comes with a job and the ensuing\nsatisfaction is a higher priority than being engaged on the job at the cost of\nweaker job security.\n\nSo, there\u2019s a subtle but definite difference between employee engagement and\njob satisfaction. Let\u2019s look at the top factors influencing these parameters.\n\n## **Factors Affecting Job Satisfaction**\n\nTypically, it is the monetary and associated factors that determine how\n_satisfied_ employees are with their job. The top four elements include:\n\n### **1\\. Compensation**\n\n  \nThe first (and probably the biggest) driver of job satisfaction is\ncompensation. Remember two things here. One, the pay scale must be positioned\ncompetitively against similar companies in your region. Two, employees should\nbe able to maintain an above-average quality of life with the compensation\nprovided.\n\n### **2\\. Benefits**\n\n  \nSupporting the advantages of good pay, you can offer a comprehensive benefits\npackage that takes care of physical and mental well-being, financial wellness,\nchildcare, and family coverage. You may not need innovative perks like\nunlimited paid time off or an in-house gym. And this is a key difference\nbetween employee engagement and job satisfaction. People want stronger basics\nthan perks they can do without.\n\n### **3\\. Work-life balance**\n\n  \n62% of workers feel the work-life balance is most important for a company\nculture that fosters success.\n\nShorter commutes, the freedom to work from home, paid leaves, and mandatory\nvacation days, among other things, can ensure a positive work-life balance for\nyour workforce. They will have more time to spend with family or in personal\npursuits, thereby improving the quality of life. This is one of those factors\nthat not only ensures satisfaction but can also contribute to a certain level\nof employee engagement.\n\n### **4\\. Recognition**\n\n  \nEvery employee, no matter their personality, professional goals, or level of\nengagement/satisfaction, wants to be appreciated for their contribution. You\ncan adopt a formal structure of recognition, with annual reviews and\nappraisals, or an informal one, where achievements are acknowledged in the\nmoment. We recommend both. Note, again, that this is a factor that can enable\nboth satisfaction and engagement at work.\n\n## **Factors Affecting Employee Engagement**\n\nThe drivers of _employee engagement_ are slightly different. You\u2019ll notice\nthat they are focused more on employee development and future needs. Here are\nthe top four factors for this parameter.:\n\n### **1\\. Inspiring leadership**\n\n  \nEmployee engagement starts at the top. Company leaders must be collaborative,\nregularly interacting with their workforce, sharing ideas with them, and\nsoliciting their contributions before making a significant decision. This\nmakes employees feel like they are involved in the company's growth and keeps\nthem engaged.\n\n### **2\\. Career development**\n\n  \nIn many ways, career development can be better than employee benefits, and\nthis applies particularly to millennials/Gen Zers. [LinkedIn\u2019s 2019 Workforce\nLearning Report](https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-\nreport) found that the No. 1 reason this segment quits is the lack of learning\nand career development opportunities.\n\n### **3\\. Internal communication**\n\n  \nCommunication plays a significant role in how engaged your employees are,\nespecially if you have a large distributed workforce. The ability to connect\nin real-time, receive regular updates from the company, and quickly resolve\nissues (no matter how trivial) is critical to enabling an engagement-friendly\nworkplace.\n\n### **4\\. A culture of diversity**\n\n  \nTo ensure maximum engagement for all individuals, diverse work culture is\nessential. This means that the company is open to new ideas from every\nemployee, proactively prevents bias, and ensures equal opportunity for all.\nDiversity must be embedded within the company values, covering every minority\ngroup as well as the generational divide.\n\n**Learn More:** **[20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-\nemployee-engagement-ideas/)**\n\n## **How Do Employee Engagement Metrics Differ From Job Satisfaction\nMetrics?**\n\nTo demonstrate the difference between employee engagement and job\nsatisfaction, let\u2019s look at the findings of a 2017 survey by the Society for\nHuman Resource Management (SHRM).\n\n[SHRM\u2019s 2017 Employee Job Satisfaction and Engagement\nReport](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-\nsurveys/pages/2017-job-satisfaction-and-engagement-doors-of-opportunity-are-\nopen.aspx) found that employees are now more satisfied with work than ever\nbefore. Companies are treating their workers with respect, compensation is\nmostly attractive, and job security is now almost commonplace. In contrast,\nthe report said that engagement levels were only \"moderate,\" and there was\n\"room for organizations to improve employee engagement.\"\n\nTake a look at these job satisfaction findings in the report:\n\n  * Over half of the U.S. employees surveyed said they were satisfied with their jobs; another 38% said they were very satisfied.\n  * The top three contributors to job satisfaction were respectful treatment, total compensation, and the trust between employees and senior management.\n  * 58% of employees mentioned that job security was \u201cvery important,\u201d but only 36% were happy with the current state of job security. This is consistent across genders, generations, and job levels.\n\n  \nNow take a look at these findings on employee engagement in the report:\n\n  * The U.S. workforce, as represented by survey respondents, indicates that they are moderately engaged, with an index of 3.9 out of 5. \n  * This is a marginal improvement over previous years \u2013 employee engagement stood at 3.7 in 2014 and 3.8 in 2015.\n  * Employees are more engaged with their work on an individual level, reporting a 4.0 out of 5 engagement indices in this parameter. In contrast, they rate their colleagues' engagement with the job at a far lower 3.7 out of 5.\n\n  \nAs you can see from these metrics, it is essential to measure both\nsatisfaction and engagement separately and carefully to arrive at an accurate\npicture of organizational health. Let\u2019s look at how you can effectively\nmeasure them.\n\n### **Measure these metrics to assess job satisfaction**\n\n  \nTo pinpoint the exact level of job satisfaction among your workforce, look at\nthe more tangible aspects of your company. For example, compensation,\nbenefits, and workplace amenities are factors that require careful evaluation.\nMeasure the following three metrics to get a clear picture of job\nsatisfaction:\n\n**1\\. Absenteeism and unpaid leaves**\n\nAbsenteeism is a clear sign that employees aren\u2019t motivated enough to turn up\nfor work as per schedule. This doesn\u2019t include paid leaves \u2013 after all, if\nemployees choose to use their paid leaves to explore their personal\ngoals/targets, it suggests a positive work-life balance. But if employees are\nwilling to forego part of their compensation for unpaid leave, you may need to\nrevisit your job satisfaction measures.\n\n**2\\. Referral volumes**\n\nSomeone satisfied with their job is likely to recommend others to join as\nwell. They would like their friends and family to enjoy the same benefits that\nthey receive in your company. However, a dip in referrals could indicate\nemployees aren\u2019t satisfied.\n\nThey might still be engaged \u2013 in other words, they value their work but feel\nthat workplace benefits aren't adequate to compensate for their efforts.\nThat's why this metric needs careful observation.\n\n**3\\. Social media reviews**\n\nEmployee reviews on social networks like Glassdoor or Indeed can reveal\nvaluable data on job satisfaction. Often, the information they might not share\ndirectly with their employer is expressed via social media. Turn reviews into\naction points and monitor the impact on your job satisfaction scores.\n\n### **Measure these metrics to gauge employee engagement**\n\n  \nEmployee engagement has a broader purview than satisfaction. This is why the\nmetrics for measurement are slightly more complex \u2013 they capture a variety of\nvariables. Track the following three parameters to ascertain how engaged\nemployees are at your company:\n\n**1\\. Employee net promoter score (eNPS)**\n\neNPS indicates an employee\u2019s willingness to recommend others (note that the\nactual volume of referrals isn\u2019t part of eNPS calculations). Employees assign\nyour company a score of 0 to 10, depending on which they are categorized as\npromoters, detractors, or passives. A large number of promoters than\ndetractors is a good sign of engagement. Read more about this on our detailed\nguide to eNPS.\n\n**2\\. Offer acceptance rates**\n\nOffer acceptance rates reflect the candidate engagement factor at your\ncompany. Let\u2019s say a company is scheduled to onboard 10 recruits in a month \u2013\nbut only five of them turn up. There is a clear gap in engaging these\ncandidates. This could be a reflection of the overall engagement at your\ncompany \u2013 if the engagement efforts cannot bring in candidates, they may be\nless successful in retaining current employees.\n\n**3\\. Total health index (THI)**\n\nThis is a relatively new concept that aims to capture three traits of employee\nengagement. First, it measures attendance, a basic criterion that shows\ninterest. Second, it factors in unhealthy presenteeism: when employees turn up\nto work despite feeling unwell or facing other pressures. Finally, it\nevaluates willingness for discretionary effort, where employees are resilient\nenough to go the extra mile for the company. Providing a picture of overall\nengagement, this metric helps organizations streamline efforts in multiple\nareas to ensure total engagement during the employee lifecycle.\n\n## **Employee Engagement and Job Satisfaction on Maslow\u2019s Pyramid**\n\nOne way to understand the difference between employee engagement and job\nsatisfaction \u2013 as well as how the two are related \u2013 is by placing them on\nMaslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs pyramid.\n\nMaslow\u2019s pyramid is widely applied to study the different factors influencing\nworkplace engagement. Interestingly, if you look at the bottom three layers,\nthey deal primarily with job satisfaction drivers. As you progress up the\npyramid, factors contributing to employee engagement come into play. The\npyramid also suggests that job satisfaction and employee engagement belong on\nthe same spectrum, and you cannot have one without the other.\n\n![. Job satisfaction and employee engagement represented on Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy\nof Needs](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. Job satisfaction and employee engagement represented on Maslow\u2019s\nHierarchy of Needs**\n\nJob satisfaction is the foundation without which employee engagement cannot be\nsustained. And employee engagement differentiates the job role from the many\nothers available to the professional. It gives the work meaning and a sense of\npurpose, enabling pride and self-development \u2013 factors necessary to achieve\none\u2019s full potential.\n\nSo, the progress would look like this: companies begin by regularly measuring\njob satisfaction among employees. They implement the necessary measures to\nimprove satisfaction. They then follow them up with **[employee engagement\nsurveys](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nan-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-examples/)** ,\nunderstanding the areas where the company isn\u2019t performing so well.\nAccordingly, engagement initiatives can be deployed \u2013 this could include\ncareer pathing programs, out-of-the-box perks, personalized learning,\ncustomized rewards, and so on.\n\nGoing back to our original example, imagine if Amanda's company had to wait\nfor over two years before launching their product. On the surface, it may seem\nthat Amanda is extraordinarily engaged and invested in the company's future.\nBut biannual surveys could reveal that she is not experiencing any\nsatisfaction in her job, making her a prime candidate for voluntary\n**[attrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-attrition-complete-guide/)**.\n\nFor outcome-focused companies, there's always a risk of prioritizing\nengagement over satisfaction. And the reverse might be true in process-based\nverticals. That's why it is so important to use a framework like Maslow's\nhierarchy of needs to understand precisely where you are on the spectrum. To\nbecome an employer of choice, start at the bottom and offer support to your\nemployees as they make their way to the top of the pyramid.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **15 Essential Employee Satisfaction Survey Questions for\nYour 2020 Questionnaire**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-satisfaction-survey-questions/)\n\n## **Key Takeaways**\n\nEmployee engagement and job satisfaction might be different, but they both\nplay a vital role for companies looking to improve **[employee\nretention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/)** and maximize\nproductivity. That\u2019s why you should keep the following points of difference in\nmind:\n\n**Job satisfaction**\n\n|\n\n**Employee engagement**  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nIt is the sense of contentment in life that one experiences as a direct result\nof being employed at their current job.\n\n|\n\nIt is the level of interest and connectedness one feels with the work\nenvironment and the company during everyday professional interactions.  \n  \nCompensation, benefits, work-life balance, and recognition \u2013 the traditional\ncomponents of a total rewards package \u2013 drive job satisfaction.\n\n|\n\nLeadership, career development, communication, and diversity \u2013 the components\nof the employee value proposition[\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-\nemployee-value-proposition-and-how-to-create-a-successful-evp-model/)\u2013 drive\nengagement.  \n  \nAs per Maslow\u2019s pyramid, job satisfaction is a basic necessity for any\nemployee.\n\n|\n\nEmployee engagement should be something that every organization aspires to,\nculminating in self-fulfillment for employees.  \n  \nBy regularly measuring both facets, you can ensure that your company is on the\nright track. It will help to reduce voluntary attrition, strengthen your\nemployer brand, and accelerate growth, unhindered by workforce-related\nroadblocks.\n\n_What is your assessment of the difference between employee engagement and job\nsatisfaction?
