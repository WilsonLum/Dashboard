In order to secure a foothold in the changing economic\nlandscape, companies must seek new resourcing strategies, more specifically,\nversatile and cost-effective solutions to provide flexibility and build\nresilience in their businesses.\n\nAn increasing number of companies have, thus, turned their attention towards\noutsourcing to address their operational and resourcing needs. However, the\ngap between a company\u2019s strategic development needs and routine processes has\nbeen insufficiently bridged.\n\nIt is here HR outsourcing service providers play an important role in yielding\nthe essential resource of allocating professional HR assistance without the\nclient having to invest expenses into hiring a full in-house HR team.

This change in residency of customers\u2019 data was unexpected - customers\nwere told of this in late February - and it will see data jurisdiction move\nfrom within the EU (Ireland) to the US.\n\nWhile consumers may not read the updated terms of service, professionals have\nbeen more cautious. Reaction among CISOs and Data Protection Officers has been\nvaried as they try to discern the impact of the move on their rights as data\nowners.\n\n**US Cloud Act**\n\nFor enterprises that are concerned by the US Cloud Act, remember that the Act\nrequires confirmation that the data subject at the centre of an order is a US\ncitizen.  Further assessments take place as part of the order, such as;\nwhether the request to the cloud provider breaches local law; whether there is\nan executive agreement in place; whether there are defeating arguments in\nplace against the order; and whether there is a need for a comity analysis by\na US court. These steps easily debunk myths that the US Cloud Act simply\nallows the US to demand access to any information.\n\n**GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018**\n\nFor organisations with employees that remain in the EU post-Brexit, existing\nGDPR regulations allow you to store and process data in a jurisdiction as long\nas that data is processed in compliance with the GDPR. There is a 12 month\nnegotiation period during which all EU protections are still afforded to UK\ncitizens, but by the time the clock runs down we will be hoping to see the UK\ngovernment review and ratify the Data Protection Act 2018 as part of its\ncomprehensive review of all legislation that is impacted by the country\u2019s exit\nfrom the EU. This Act was finalised as the UK enactment of the EU GDPR\nlegislation, so should provide a lot of reassurances about the protection of\nUK data, but it will still also need to go to the EU for ratification of\n\u2018adequacy approval\u2019 to confirm its equivalency to GDPR to allow for UK-EU and\nEU-UK data transfers.\n\n**Privacy Shield**\n\nAnother important data protection mechanism to watch in the coming year will\nbe the status of a UK - US Privacy Shield framework agreement. Privacy Shield\nreplaced the US Safe Harbor agreement and promises that \u2018HR and non-HR\u2019 data\ntransferred to the US has the same protection as if it is held in an EU\njurisdiction. Until now, UK organisations were able to sign up for EU-US\nPrivacy Shield, but as the UK has left the EU this protection will need\nclarifying over the next few months. Switzerland has its own Privacy Shield\nagreement with the US and the most obvious model would be for the UK to do\nlikewise.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

A review of existing GSuite contracts to determine which\ninternational data transfer agreement is in place is recommended. This is\nsomething that should be done for all cloud services in use by an organisation\n- both sanctioned and shadow - to ensure that organisational data is being\nkept in compliance with the necessary global regulations.\n\nIn the face of these new Terms of Service, we will not see an exodus of\nenterprise Google customers looking to replace their infrastructure with local\nservice providers. The complex web of international data protection laws means\nthere is no clear need. However, we may see very large enterprise GSuite\ncustomers in a good position to make demands about where their own data is\nheld, for their stakeholders\u2019 reassurance, even if these demands fall outside\nof the normal Google operational model. There are significant flagship GSuite\ncustomers in the UK and it may be that they can attain exceptions for their\nown data residency.\n\nFor GSuite customers who are not so powerful, but are still uncomfortable with\ntheir data potentially sitting within the US jurisdiction, the EUUG is a\nfascinating model to consider.  EUUG is the European User Group for Enterprise\nand Cloud Data Protection, and it was formed to give some of Europe\u2019s\nfinancial institutions unionised empowerment in negotiations with Microsoft.\nUK CISOs can perhaps take heart from the naming of this group and the fact\nthat they are still in Europe even if they are no longer in the EU.\n\nPerhaps complexity around international data protection will see more\norganisational coalitions formed in the future, with cloud customers creating\ngroups of organisations that can resist unilateral decisions around data\nresidency and jurisdiction. With global political alliances and trading\nagreements shifting, we are likely to continue to see national and multi-\nnational data protection case law being tested. On the surface however, there\nis currently no immediate need for panic around Google\u2019s new terms of service\nfor UK customers.\n\n**Read the latest from the Data Economy Newsroom:**\n\n  * [Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and beyond](https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-remote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/)\n  * [Vantage Data Centers acquires Next Generation Data for undisclosed sum](https://data-economy.com/vantage-data-centers-acquires-next-generation-data-for-undisclosed-sum/)\n  * [IXcellerate appoints John Souter to its Advisory Board](https://data-economy.com/ixcellerate-appoints-john-souter-to-its-advisory-board/)\n  * [Brookfield Infrastructure set to issue $400m of Medium-Term Notes](https://data-economy.com/brookfield-infrastructure-set-to-issue-400m-of-medium-term-notes/)\n\n  * More On:\n  * [Netskope](https://data-economy.com/tag/netskope/)\n  * [Data](https://data-economy.com/tag/data/)\n  * [google](https://data-economy.com/tag/google/)\n\n  * [__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?url=https://data-economy.com/uk-google-data-moving-to-the-us-what-does-this-mean-for-uk-organisations/)\n  * [__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://data-economy.com/uk-google-data-moving-to-the-us-what-does-this-mean-for-uk-organisations/&text=UK Google data moving to the US \u2013 what does this mean for UK organisations? via @dataeconomy)\n  * [__LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://data-economy.com/uk-google-data-moving-to-the-us-what-does-this-mean-for-uk-organisations/&mini=true&title=UK Google data moving to the US \u2013 what does this mean for UK organisations?)\n  * [__Email](mailto:?subject=Take%20a%20look%20at%20this%20article%20on%20Data%20Economy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fdata-economy.com%2Fuk-google-data-moving-to-the-us-what-does-this-mean-for-uk-organisations%2F)\n  * __Other\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/728x89-media-\ngraphic.jpg?x13542)](https://edition.pagesuite-\nprofessional.co.uk/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=643864ce-d840-49b4-ac33-7ec2b1e552f3)\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/720x90_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2ICmmo5)\n\n# More News\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/intel-2018-manufacturing-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [High-Performance Computing Is Facing an Energy-Efficiency\nCrisis](https://data-economy.com/high-performance-computing-is-facing-an-\nenergy-efficiency-crisis/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ezat-Dayeh-Senior-\nSystems-Engineer-UKI-Cohesity-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [5G means rethinking data management\u2026 even before you deploy](https://data-\neconomy.com/5g-means-rethinking-data-management-even-before-you-deploy/)\n\n![Bimal Khandelwal, CFO \u2013 STT Global Data Centres](https://data-\neconomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bimal-Khandelwal-CFO-\u2013-STT-Global-Data-\nCentres-India-Private-Limited-2-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [The benefits of an increasing rise in Edge Data Centres](https://data-\neconomy.com/the-benefits-of-an-increasing-rise-in-edge-data-centres/)\n\n* * *\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Share\n\n  * [Thought Leadership](https://data-economy.com/tag/thought-leadership/)\n\n# High-Performance Computing Is Facing an Energy-Efficiency Crisis\n\n* * *\n\nBy [Sponsored Content](https://data-economy.com/author/sponsored-content/)\nPublished: 09:30, 7 April, 2020  Updated: 19:32, 5 April, 2020\n\n* * *\n\n  * [__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?url=https://data-economy.com/high-performance-computing-is-facing-an-energy-efficiency-crisis/)\n  * [__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://data-economy.com/high-performance-computing-is-facing-an-energy-efficiency-crisis/&text=High-Performance Computing Is Facing an Energy-Efficiency Crisis via @dataeconomy)\n  * [__LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://data-economy.com/high-performance-computing-is-facing-an-energy-efficiency-crisis/&mini=true&title=High-Performance Computing Is Facing an Energy-Efficiency Crisis)\n  * [__Email](mailto:?subject=Take%20a%20look%20at%20this%20article%20on%20Data%20Economy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fdata-economy.com%2Fhigh-performance-computing-is-facing-an-energy-efficiency-crisis%2F)\n  * __Other\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/intel-2018-manufacturing-682x395.jpg?x13542) Margaret\nHenschel, one of the more than 50,000 Intel employees in the United States,\nmoves through Fab 32, a high-volume manufacturing facility in Chandler,\nArizona.

Yes, HPC holds the promise of solving the most difficult\nbusiness, industrial, societal, medical and even existential quandaries\ntroubling humanity. But the energy-efficiency crisis facing this wondrous,\nnext-gen technology must first be addressed to unlock its full potential.\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/intel.jpg?x13542)_Rami\nRadi, Software Application Engineer of Intel Data Center Management Solutions_\n\nWhile no widely agreed-upon definition has yet to emerge, generally speaking,\nHPC describes the ability to process data and perform highly complex\ncalculations at amazingly high speeds, by which we mean not billions, but\nquadrillions of calculations per second.\n\nAnother element that distinguishes HPC is its architecture. Instead of a\nmonolithic, single-box design, compute servers are networked together into a\ncluster, and software programs and algorithms run simultaneously on the\nservers in the cluster, which is then networked to data storage. An HPC\ncluster can comprise hundreds or even thousands of compute servers.\n\nHPC solutions can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or at the edge. Used\nacross a wide range of industries, including financial services, healthcare,\nmanufacturing, oil and gas, and research and educational institutions,\naccording to a study by Grand View Research, the global HPC market is expected\nto reach $59.65 billion by 2025, expanding at a compound annual growth rate\n(CAGR) of 7.2%, from $34.62 billion in 2017.\n\nOften integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning\ntechnologies, HPC is already helping to detect credit card fraud, track stock\ntrends in real-time, and automate trading. Enabling faster, and more accurate\npatient diagnosis, and assisting in the development of cures for cancer and\ndiabetes. And assisting scientists to find sources of renewable energy and\nunderstand the evolution of our universe.\n\nHowever, as companies build data science applications, recommendation engines,\nlarge-scale analytics, and other new applications driven by HPC, they are\nfinding that legacy data centers, traditional computing platforms and network\narchitectures are not equipped to handle these new demands.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

Among the most\nsignificant data center challenges associated with HPC are power requirements,\nwhich translate to major energy costs. Because HPC aggregates computing power\nin a way not typically associated with standard server infrastructure, it also\nrequires denser banks of computer resources to increase capacity and reduce\nlatency, while minimizing floorspace. To avoid the potential for unplanned\ndowntime, careful consideration must therefore be given to future-proofing as\nit relates to power availability. Running a high power density HPC deployment\ngenerates significant heat as well, which brings to the fore the problem of\nineffective or insufficient cooling capacity.\n\nThe cooling systems used in many older data centers date back to an era of\nsignificantly lower power densities. As a result, legacy facilities often\nstruggle to accommodate the intense heat generated by HPC deployments, or do\nhave sufficient cooling capacity but are unable to distribute it where needed.\nFrequently, a facility may not be operating at the capacity for which it was\noriginally designed. The unfortunate response is to resort to overcooling,\nwasting electrical energy and expanding the data center\u2019s carbon footprint in\nthe process. Cooling alone can account for 30 to 40 percent of the power costs\nfor the data center.\n\nFaced with these and other challenges, data center management solutions can\nassist IT managers to gain a better understanding of the power consumption and\nthermal status of servers in HPC deployments. These tools provide real-time\nand historical thermal maps and cooling analysis, monitoring not only servers\nand racks, but also storage, networks and equipment.\n\nMost significantly, in an HPC environment where servers can run approximately\n30 percent hotter due to the size of the compute workloads and density, data\ncenter management solutions enable IT staff to detect hotspots and cooling\nanomalies before they cause critical incidents. Moreover, these tools empower\nIT administrators to reduce cooling costs and improve Power Usage\nEffectiveness (PUE) by safely raising the temperature of the server room while\ncontinuously monitoring data center devices for thermal issues.\n\nArmed with accurate real-time power and thermal consumption data provided by\nsoftware solutions such as [Intel\u00ae Data Center\nManager](http://www.intel.com/dcm) (Intel\u00ae DCM), IT staff gain the insight\nneeded to manage, plan and forecast power usage, increase rack density, and\nprolong operation during outages. In fact, monitoring the temperature and\npower consumption of each server in an HPC test environment was found to\nreduce power consumption by up to 5 to 8 percent through allocation to nodes\nwith high power efficiency. Intel\u00ae DCM also monitors granular sub-component\nfailure analysis and out of band real-time utilization data, including CPU,\ndisk, and memory. These capabilities provide predictive component-level health\nmanagement, reduce mean time to repair (MTTR), and ultimately increase uptime.\n\nAdditionally, data center management solutions enable IT staff to quickly\ndetect and analyze underutilized systems by monitoring their CPU utilization\nand power consumption over time, which provides the needed power statistics\nfor every rack and server model with no additional hardware or software\nneeded. It is essential to understand how a workload is utilizing the\nresources of all the systems in the HPC clusters it is running on, and this\ncan be accomplished using a data center management solution. Armed with this\nknowledge, data center administrators can better plan and manage capacity and\nutilization in racks, increase their rack densities, and delay adding new\nracks.\n\nMake no mistake, the challenges of large-scale HPC environments are hardly\nunsolvable. Rather, data center management solutions can help ensure that the\n[powerful computational\ncapabilities](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/helping-solve-\nmysteries-universe-case-study.html) and insights these deployments provide\nwill continue unencumbered and at a rapid pace, whether on-prem, in the cloud,\nor at the edge.\n\n**Read the latest from the Data Economy Newsroom:**\n\n  * [Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and

*\n\n**As the latest cellular generation comes under consideration, CIOs will need\nto tackle data fragmentation, writes Ezat Dayeh, Senior Systems Engineer UK\n&I, Cohesity.**\n\nToday, 5G stands at that iciest of pinnacles, Gartner\u2019s Peak of Inflated\nExpectations. This is the analyst firm\u2019s famously stratospheric zenith, after\nwhich lies the inevitable Trough of Disillusionment when, after having\nexamined all the options, CIOs decide that, no, we really can live with 4G and\nWiFi a little longer.\n\nThe benefits of 5G might be compelling for consumers pursuing every bit and\nbyte of performance to plays games and stream high-def movies, but for\nbusinesses the real adoption cycle is a little way away. However, the benefits\nof 5G lie beyond performance, with power efficiency, security and virtualised\nresource allocation meaning its eventual corporate deployment is inevitable\nfor remote locations, the Internet of Things, driverless vehicles, factory\nautomation and much else. Best to plan now to accommodate what may turn out to\nbe very significant IT impacts.  \n\nSpecifically, the impacts on data management need to be factored in now to\navoid both \u2018bill shock\u2019 and, more important, a potential crisis in how data is\nprocessed and stored. As ever, there will be elements that may come as a\nsurprise but if we start today with some planning assumptions, we will have a\nstrong platform to manage 5G\u2019s entry into mainstream corporate computing.\n\n**You need to move fast.** Not to deploy 5G today that is, but to manage the\nreal-time environments that come with the technology. 5G provides speed, high\navailability and reliability for potentially mission-critical environments. We\ncan\u2019t wait until the end of the month to check how the brakes on driverless\ncars are working or until the end of the quarter to analyse whether our\nsensor-equipped factories had enough fuel. Data will need to be processed,\ntransferred and stored instantly and speed, data consistency and reliability\nwill be the critical triumvirate of needs.\n\n**Legacy will be impacted.** 5G will take software defined infrastructure to\nplaces that fixed networks and even WiFi can\u2019t reach today. Its capacity and\nreach will make it a boon for remote locations and its high availability and\nuptime features will make it a potential replacement for WiFi.\n\n**Industry 4.0 will be realised.** So far, the fourth age of industry has been\nmore media meme than reality but with the low latency and raw speed of 5G,\ncompanies seeking intelligent, sensor-connected ecosystems of partner networks\nhave a new communications backbone that will underpin broader change in how we\nthink about, design, manufacture, sell and service products and services.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

Expect telecoms businesses\nto begin to look a lot like cloud service providers and managed service\nproviders, offering a one-stop-shop for enterprises and a way out of\ncommoditisation for themselves.\n\n**Data fragmentation is only going to get worse unless you act.** A recent\nVanson Bourne survey showed that over 90 per cent of businesses believed that\nthe promise of public cloud hadn\u2019t been realised because their organisations\nare weighed down by mass data fragmentation issues where data is stored and\nreplicated in backups, file shares, clouds, object stores, test/dev sites and\nanalytics sites. That can lead to data compliance challenges, increased\nstorage costs, huge expense and admin burn-out. Getting to grips with managing\ndistributed data will be key as more endpoints become mobile and devices\ncapture more critical, sensitive information that they send back to the\ncorporate datacentre.\n\nThis last point is huge. Veterans of previous cellular generations will be\nfamiliar with the adoption cadence but they may have neglected the creep of\ndata fragmentation and the issues it leads to. So, subscribe to the \u2018less is\nmore\u2019 philosophy:\n\n  * Reduce the amount of data your enterprise stores and collects now. \n  * Review whether the grounds for which the personal data is being processed is lawful, and whether it is entirely necessary to store it all. \n  * Run a thorough Data Protection Impact Assessment to see where personal and non-personal data is stored, who has access to it, and how many copies exist.\n\n  * Update your data governance framework. You may have made changes over the past few years or may plan to make more as you bring on new services, applications and technologies. \n  * Implement new compliance systems. 5G empowers users but at what cost? Control and focus are required before you consider how to implement.

At the micro-level,\nit\u2019s being propelled by digital technology\u2019s new applications that are\ntransforming every aspect of how we work, live and travel. The cascading\nvolumes of digital data and mobile services are triggering immense growth in\nthe aggregate data demand.\n\nAt the macro level, the nation\u2019s [Digital India and Smart Cities\u2019\nmissions](https://data-economy.com/india-is-open/), to name just two, are\ndriving an unprecedented increase in annual growth for data services. Against\nthis backdrop, the data centre industry needs to keep providing increasing\ndata capacity as well as greater computing speeds simply to keep pace with the\ngargantuan demand. But centralized data centres and cloud computing support\ncannot overcome the challenge of latency for end-users in tier 2 and tier 3\ncities.\n\n**Why Localization Wins**\n\nTo overcome the latency barrier, localization of data centres is\nindispensable. EDCs overcome the latency hurdle by supporting computing and\ndata storage needs as close to the end-users as possible. Although latency\ncannot be eliminated totally, it is majorly minimized. EDCs function on the\nprinciple of many smaller but well-distributed data centres providing a more\nviable solution as near the home location of consumers as possible.\n\nIn other words, burgeoning customer needs are driving the demand for EDCs. In\nfact, EDC locations are driven by diverse business imperatives, including\napplication latency plus network capacity and costs. In India, working closely\nwith the Centre and State Governments can benefit EDCs, given the concurrent\nand developing demand from Smart Cities and other institutional users. In\nthese cases, EDC services can be delivered faster and seamlessly due to their\ngeographical proximity. In such scenarios, one EDC could be connected to\nmultiple EDCs.\n\nThereby, storing, processing and caching data and, thereafter, delivering the\nrequisite information at the appropriate moment and the right place could be\ndone speedily when needed. With EDCs, centralized data centres can then be\nsidelined because cloud features are available right at the site of\noperations, at cost-effective rates.\n\nOf course, whereas EDCs can provide a series of services independently, they\ncould use centralized data centres in supporting them for cloud services and\nanalytics. But EDCs would still hold the edge in this symbiotic relationship\nsince they function as co-located data setups where the data is processed and\nanalysed closer to the client\u2019s location. Thereby, cloud computing facilities\ncould be offered to multiple companies.\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

Whereas centralized\ndata centres could be more than 100,000 square feet, EDCs can operate from\nrelatively smaller areas via new designs and operating systems requiring lower\ninvestments. These co-located data centres benefit startups and traditional\ncompanies wherein proximity and cost containment are dominant elements in\nservicing demand. A major benefit of proximity lies in enabling almost real-\ntime data analysis.\n\nThere is another way whereby edge computing lowers connectivity costs \u2013\neliminating the constant need for lightning-quick connectivity between\nconventional data centres and devices. Rather, super-quick connectivity is\nreserved for data that requires urgent processing. Meanwhile, data without\nurgency is serviced through alternate connectivity arrangements.\n\n**Demand and Distribution Dividends**\n\nIt needs to be clarified, however, that conventional data centres will\ncontinue serving their purpose of processing all the core data where long-term\nretention is crucial. Of course, in all the arrangements, transparency is\nessential so that the customer clearly comprehends the cost differential and\nroles of EDCs and conventional DCs. Transparency can make it clear to\ncustomers why centralised cloud computing is not necessarily the best option\nfor geographically-distributed applications.\n\nA Gartner study reveals that the next generation of business innovation would\nbe powered by the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and 5G. All of\nthese will propel a data production power surge where more than 7.5 billion\nconnected devices will be used by enterprises in 2020 itself. Naturally, all\nthese connected devices will not be located in metropolitan cities only. As a\nresult, their diverse spread is incentivizing data centre infrastructure to be\nmore distributed to reap the dividends of increasing demand.\n\nFurthermore, the above conditions are creating a virtuous cycle and inducing\nchanges in data centre infrastructure, which are gradually becoming more\ndistributed, as stated earlier. As a consequence, more storage hubs are likely\nto emerge in smaller cities and other regional markets. In addition, micro\ndata centres can be attached to sections of already-existing communications\ninfrastructure, which includes telecom towers.\n\nMuch of these changes are already underway across India as the digital\necosystem keeps growing and influencing overall sectoral growth. But as EDCs\nare more widespread, it will call for a concomitant, widely-distributed surge\nin storage and security systems. Be they institutional or non-institutional\nusers, they will demand similar levels of performance and security earlier\noffered by conventional data centres. Therefore, deliverables and efficacy\noffered by the centralised data centres would need to be replicated by EDCs\nfor their lower-latency services model to enjoy the same success as the\nformer.\n\nFinally, for both customers and EDCs, such storage and security solutions will\nhave to be determined at the beginning of the planning processes before the\nnew models are poised for rollout. Thanks to the nationwide drive towards a\nsmart digital future, sooner or later, India\u2019s ICT industry will witness the\nmass emergence of EDCs across its landscape, benefitting both end-users and\ndeployers.\n\n_Author: Bimal Khandelwal, CFO,_ [_STT GDC\nIndia_](https://www.sttelemediagdc.in/)\n\n**Read the latest from the Data Economy Newsroom:**\n\n  * [Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and beyond](https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-remote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/)\n  * [Vantage Data Centers acquires Next Generation Data for undisclosed sum](https://data-economy.com/vantage-data-centers-acquires-next-generation-data-for-undisclosed-sum/)\n  * [IXcellerate appoints John Souter to its Advisory Board](https://data-economy.com/ixcellerate-appoints-john-souter-to-its-advisory-board/)\n  * [Brookfield Infrastructure set to issue $400m of Medium-Term Notes](https://data-economy.com/brookfield-infrastructure-set-to-issue-400m-of-medium-term-notes/)\n\n  * More On:\n  * [STT Telemedia](https://data-economy.com/tag/stt-telemedia/)\n  * [India](https://data-economy.com/tag/india/)\n  * [Data Centres](https://data-economy.com/tag/data-centres/)\n\n  * [__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?url=https://data-economy.com/the-benefits-of-an-increasing-rise-in-edge-data-centres/)\n  * [__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://data-economy.com/the-benefits-of-an-increasing-rise-in-edge-data-centres/&text=The benefits of an increasing rise in Edge Data Centres via @dataeconomy)\n  * [__LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://data-economy.com/the-benefits-of-an-increasing-rise-in-edge-data-centres/&mini=true&title=The benefits of an increasing rise in Edge Data Centres)\n  * [__Email](mailto:?subject=Take%20a%20look%20at%20this%20article%20on%20Data%20Economy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fdata-economy.com%2Fthe-benefits-of-an-increasing-rise-in-edge-data-centres%2F)\n  * __Other\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/720x90_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2ICmmo5)\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/728x89-media-\ngraphic.jpg?x13542)](https://edition.pagesuite-\nprofessional.co.uk/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=643864ce-d840-49b4-ac33-7ec2b1e552f3)\n\n# More News\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/intel-2018-manufacturing-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [High-Performance Computing Is Facing an Energy-Efficiency\nCrisis](https://data-economy.com/high-performance-computing-is-facing-an-\nenergy-efficiency-crisis/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ezat-Dayeh-Senior-\nSystems-Engineer-UKI-Cohesity-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [5G means rethinking data management\u2026 even before you deploy](https://data-\neconomy.com/5g-means-rethinking-data-management-even-before-you-deploy/)\n\n![Bimal Khandelwal, CFO \u2013 STT Global Data Centres](https://data-\neconomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bimal-Khandelwal-CFO-\u2013-STT-Global-Data-\nCentres-India-Private-Limited-2-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [The benefits of an increasing rise in Edge Data Centres](https://data-\neconomy.com/the-benefits-of-an-increasing-rise-in-edge-data-centres/)\n\n* * *\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Share\n\n  * [Thought Leadership](https://data-economy.com/tag/thought-leadership/)\n\n# The sharper edge of computing, powered by micro-modular data centres and 5G\nnetworks\n\n* * *\n\nBy [Guest Contributor](https://data-economy.com/author/guestcontributor/)\nPublished: 13:55, 2 April, 2020  Updated: 13:56, 2 April, 2020\n\n* * *\n\n  * [__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?url=https://data-economy.com/the-sharper-edge-of-computing-powered-by-micro-modular-data-centres-and-5g-networks/)\n  * [__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://data-economy.com/the-sharper-edge-of-computing-powered-by-micro-modular-data-centres-and-5g-networks/&text=The sharper edge of computing, powered by micro-modular data centres and 5G networks via @dataeconomy)\n  * [__LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://data-economy.com/the-sharper-edge-of-computing-powered-by-micro-modular-data-centres-and-5g-networks/&mini=true&title=The sharper edge of computing, powered by micro-modular data centres and 5G networks)\n  * [__Email](mailto:?subject=Take%20a%20look%20at%20this%20article%20on%20Data%20Economy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fdata-economy.com%2Fthe-sharper-edge-of-computing-powered-by-micro-modular-data-centres-and-5g-networks%2F)\n  * __Other\n\n![Stephen Jones, Business Development Lead & Strategic Accounts - EMEA,\nSeagate Technology](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/0-1.jpg?x13542) by Stephen Jones, Business Development\nLead & Strategic Accounts - EMEA, Seagate Technology\n\n* * *\n\nHere\u2019s a simple question. Can today\u2019s networks handle tomorrow\u2019s massive data?\nRight now, the answer is \u2018probably not\u2019. But with the introduction of 5G\ncellular connectivity in the UK and beyond, and the emergence of specialised\ndata centres at the edge, new possibilities are emerging in how data can be\nturned into the information advantage. And enable the answer to that question\ninto a \u2018yes\u2019.\n\nWith the growing prevalence of bandwidth-hungry applications and technologies,\nlike the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence in its many forms, and\nsimple reliance on connectivity for everyone, it becomes clear why a sharper\nfocus on the edge is inevitable.\n\n**The challenge, laid bare**\n\nAs devices perform actions at the endpoint, signals travel over the network to\nthe data centre, where processing happens, with the results sent back to where\nrequired. The problem rapidly arising is directly linked to the explosion of\ndata generated by all the devices.\n\nWe are not just talking about the smartphones and tablets the seven billion\npeople on the planet own that constantly generate data. It\u2019s also vehicle\ntelemetry, signals from environmental monitoring devices, businesses with\nhundreds or thousands of workers, gadgets and IoT sensors of every conceivable\nkind.\n\nNow, people and devices are one thing. The quantity of data they generate is\nquite another. It\u2019s almost as if we\u2019re running out of suitably impactful\nmeasures of just how much data we\u2019re talking about. By 2025, it will be an\nestimated 175 zettabytes.\n\nWhat all those devices and data mean, in the simplest of terms which lays bare\nthe implications for cloud computing, is that the pipes are just not big\nenough to transport it from the point of origin, to a data centre, and back\nagain. As Cole Crawford, CEO of Texas-headquartered solutions provider Vapor\nIO puts it, \u201cThere simply is not enough fibre in the ground.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n**Newsletter**\n\nTime is precious, but news has no time.

Data is not the same thing as\ninformation. In fact, those 175 zettabytes of raw data are in some ways akin\nto bare land: it\u2019s not an asset until you do something with it. With advanced\napplications like AI, speed absolutely counts. Timing is everything \u2013 you only\nneed imagine a navigational decision by a self-driving car to appreciate this\nfact. Or consider how deteriorating performance from a key application can\nimpact profitability.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why a new concept in data centres is emerging, providing\norganisations with the ability to put the processing where it\u2019s needed.\n\nWhere many cloud data centres are centralised \u2018hyperscale\u2019 facilities, the\nedge is powered by micro-modular data centres.\n\nThis is what they look like: a small self-contained \u2018block\u2019 of data processing\ncompute and storage capabilities co-located with existing infrastructure.\nCellular towers, for example, are ideal locations not only because they\ntypically can accommodate a micro-modular data centre, but also because they\nare the literal \u2018infrastructure edge\u2019 and therefore the very definition of the\n\u2018last mile\u2019 in connectivity.\n\nImagine, every time there is a \u2018hop\u2019 from one network to another (and there\nmight be hundreds of hops between you and a hyperscale data centre), delays\noccur. This round trip creates latency.\n\nBut not when the computing is right there at the edge.\n\n**The edge in context**\n\nIt\u2019s never wise to predict the demise of anything in the technology space, as\nmany production mainframes attest and the hyperscale data centre isn\u2019t going\nanywhere. However, it is increasingly being complemented by edge micro-modular\ndata centres and the processing these facilities put into the field.\n\nAs has always been the case for enterprise storage, the information generated\nby the edge devices and data centres will be tiered. It starts at the edge and\nwill eventually offload to the \u2018mother ship\u2019 of the hyperscale data centre,\nwhere as its value decays it will be stored on assets of the appropriate\nperformance and cost.\n\nSo here\u2019s the crux of developments at the edge: Companies today need to\nexamine how and where edge computing can add value in their businesses,\nunderstanding how they can tie in some of the more recent developments in\ntechnology, including automation and AI. It\u2019s all about understanding how the\nedge can work for you.\n\n**Read the latest from the Data Economy Newsroom:**\n\n  * [Linxdatacenter introduces IT tools for remote work during pandemic and beyond](https://data-economy.com/linxdatacenter-introduces-it-tools-for-remote-work-during-pandemic-and-beyond/)\n  * [Vantage Data Centers acquires Next Generation Data for undisclosed sum](https://data-economy.com/vantage-data-centers-acquires-next-generation-data-for-undisclosed-sum/)\n  * [IXcellerate appoints John Souter to its Advisory Board](https://data-economy.com/ixcellerate-appoints-john-souter-to-its-advisory-board/)\n  * [Brookfield Infrastructure set to issue $400m of Medium-Term Notes](https://data-economy.com/brookfield-infrastructure-set-to-issue-400m-of-medium-term-notes/)\n\n  * More On:\n  * [Seagate](https://data-economy.com/tag/seagate/)\n  * [5g](https://data-economy.com/tag/5g/)\n  * [Edge Computing](https://data-economy.com/tag/edge-computing/)\n  * [telecommunications](https://data-economy.com/tag/telecommunications/)\n  * [Data Centres](https://data-economy.com/tag/data-centres/)\n\n  * [__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?url=https://data-economy.com/the-sharper-edge-of-computing-powered-by-micro-modular-data-centres-and-5g-networks/)\n  * [__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://data-economy.com/the-sharper-edge-of-computing-powered-by-micro-modular-data-centres-and-5g-networks/&text=The sharper edge of computing, powered by micro-modular data centres and 5G networks via @dataeconomy)\n  * [__LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://data-economy.com/the-sharper-edge-of-computing-powered-by-micro-modular-data-centres-and-5g-networks/&mini=true&title=The sharper edge of computing, powered by micro-modular data centres and 5G networks)\n  * [__Email](mailto:?subject=Take%20a%20look%20at%20this%20article%20on%20Data%20Economy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fdata-economy.com%2Fthe-sharper-edge-of-computing-powered-by-micro-modular-data-centres-and-5g-networks%2F)\n  * __Other\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/720x90_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2ICmmo5)\n\n[ ![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/728x89-media-\ngraphic.jpg?x13542)](https://edition.pagesuite-\nprofessional.co.uk/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=643864ce-d840-49b4-ac33-7ec2b1e552f3)\n\n# More News\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/intel-2018-manufacturing-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [High-Performance Computing Is Facing an Energy-Efficiency\nCrisis](https://data-economy.com/high-performance-computing-is-facing-an-\nenergy-efficiency-crisis/)\n\n![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ezat-Dayeh-Senior-\nSystems-Engineer-UKI-Cohesity-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [5G means rethinking data management\u2026 even before you deploy](https://data-\neconomy.com/5g-means-rethinking-data-management-even-before-you-deploy/)\n\n![Bimal Khandelwal, CFO \u2013 STT Global Data Centres](https://data-\neconomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bimal-Khandelwal-CFO-\u2013-STT-Global-Data-\nCentres-India-Private-Limited-2-200x120.jpg?x13542)\n\n# [The benefits of an increasing rise in Edge Data Centres](https://data-\neconomy.com/the-benefits-of-an-increasing-rise-in-edge-data-centres/)\n\n* * *\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Share\n\n[![](https://data-economy.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/deinvest.jpg?x13542)](https://data-\neconomy.com/subscribe/)\n\n[![](https://data-economy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/240x480_Advertise-\nWith-Us-01.jpg?x13542)](http://bit.ly/2wMUmeU)\n\n# Most Popular Articles\n\n  1.

CoE Director on the biggest talent challenge Thailand is\nfacing\n\n[HR

you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement. [Find out more about the webinars\n\u00bb](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\n\n### _Thailand has moved beyond 'talent shortage' and 'talent war, to really\nmeasure impact in terms of business results, affirms Adipat Chaichanasakul, HR\nCentre of Excellence Director, True Corporation, in this interview with Nadya\nOenara. _\n\n### Q In your experience, what is the biggest talent challenge Thailand is\nfacing, and how are you tackling that?\n\nI think we are now going beyond 'talent shortage' and 'talent war', which are\nthe trends we faced in the past few years.\n\nTo solve the talent shortage, we went to 'war' in order to win over talent.\nFor example, we adjusted salary structures, increased benefits, renovated\noffices, improved employer brands, utilised more recruitment agencies, etc.\n\nIt all seems well and good, but we need to realise that we are creating\nanother problem of its own as the aforementioned activities do cost lots and\nlots of money.\n\nAs a result, cost of hiring, average salary, and overall personnel expenses\nhave increased tremendously over the years, which eventually impacted our\nEBITDA and the bottom line of our businesses. Businesses then increased prices\nof their products, impacting our cost-of-living, which ultimately would create\na need to increase the salary of our talent. This vicious cycle will\ndefinitely impact us in the long run, especially if we face with economic\ndownturn.\n\nTo attack this problem, at True Corporation, we have done all those activities\n(also guilty); but at the same time, we focused heavily on supporting our\ntalent to produce more productivity.\n\nWe are making sure that we do more with less talent. This is done through the\ndigitalisation of our company along with embedding a 'start-up like' structure\nwithin our traditional hierarchical structure. Learning & development\nactivities also aim to develop additional skills for employees, so they can be\nmore productive as well as create more value for themselves.\n\nEven within our HR team, our talent is expected to be able to be a great HR\nperson; but at the same time, join the sales force to generate revenue,\nresearch and develop new products that can be commercialised, or join\nstrategic projects to help digitalise our organisation.\n\nBy doing so, not only are we helping to generate more revenue to help\ncompensate for higher personnel experiences, but we are also adding more\nvalues for our talent, which means that their chances of being unemployed\nduring challenging times, is minimised.\n\n### Q Share with us how you ensure employees are constantly motivated,\nespecially during the current challenging economy.\n\nSimply put, we question every HR policies and practice throughout our\norganisation, from why we are paying annual variable bonuses to why our\npayroll needs to transfer money to the bank for salary payment; from why we\nneed to pay insurance company for health and life insurance to why we need to\nhave so many job titles, job families or job levels; from why we need to come\nand work at the office to why we need to use e-mail, etc.\n\nAfter asking enough questions, we discovered many opportunities to do more\nwith less, while improving employee experiences to ensure that they will\ncontinuously engaged to our company.\n\nWe also ask questions directly to our talent in term of needs and wants. What\nwe later realised is that every talent, despite coming from the same\ngeneration, same year of service, and/or same job level, has different wants\nand needs.\n\nThus, benefits, privileges, activities and programmes for our employees need\nto be able to reflect that. They need to be truly flexible and customisable\nfor each employee, on-demand, and right on time, and not just giving three-\nfour options for our talent to choose from and being able to only change once\nor twice a year like it used to be.\n\n> ##### Remember the time when Napster disrupted the music industry? I believe\n> it's time for HR professionals to openly share best practices and even some\n> of the data that can help improve all HR practices in every company.\n\n### Q If there was one crazy HR practice you could implement, with no budget\nor time constraints, what would it be?\n\nOpen-source HR!\n\nRemember the time when Napster disrupted the music industry? (Yes, I am that\nold) Look at where we are today. I believe it's time for HR professionals to\nopenly share best practices and even some of the data that can help improve\nall HR practices in every company.\n\nImagine a world where all the companies are able to effectively manage and\ndevelop talent. Our economy will be strong, unemployment rate will drop,\ninnovation will happen everywhere, and the society will be stronger. It's\ngoing to be very different.\n\nRight now, HR typically tries to improve its practices in a vacuum. We read\nabout best practices somewhere, attend site visits, go to conferences, or hire\nHR consultants to tell us what to improve and how to improve them. What we end\nup with are half-baked HR practices, policies and systems that may not yield\nthe best results.\n\nTake the hype of OKR as an example. Without a full understanding of how OKR\nworks, how it should relate to other HR practices, policies and systems, as\nwell as challenges and pitfalls of OKR, we may end up falling into the trap of\ncreating change (with the best intentions) that actually would create chaos in\na company.\n\nLet's take another extreme example: competencies model and proficiency levels.\nLet's think about this. In the process of a developing competencies model and\ncoming up with proficiency levels, we commonly hire HR consultants, where\nactually we need to provide most of the inputs, and the end result is that we\nget competencies that are so very similar to other companies!\n\n### Q Reveal to us the one thing you will look for in a winning entry\nsubmission by participants at [Thailand's debut HR Excellence\nAwards](http://bit.ly/39mKEhy).\n\nI am looking for HR practices and professionals that can actually make a\ndifference, not only in their company, but to the society, country, or perhaps\neven at the global level.\n\nCall me a dreamer, but I sincerely believe that HR holds that much power to\ncreate positive change in our society, strengthen competitiveness of each\ncountry through the company, as well as solve global issues. That is why I\nbelieve all HR professionals should fully support the 17 sustainable\ndevelopment goals (SDGs).\n\nYes, HR can help end poverty, create gender equality, become a platform for\ngood health and wellbeing, reduce hunger, improve quality of education, revive\nlife below water and life on land, and much more. That is what I am looking\nfor in a winning entry submission.

Arrays)\n\nCredit: Rolling Arrays\n\nRolling Arrays is prioritising strategic growth in Australia, New Zealand and\nwider Asian markets as the [Singapore-based HR\nspecialist](https://sg.channelasia.tech/article/647169/how-can-asian-channel-\ncapitalise-cloud/) expands through SAP SuccessFactors.\n\nWith strong presence already in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the United\nArab Emirates, plans are now in place for the implementation service provider\nto deepen capabilities within the HR technology space at a regional level,\nsince launching in 2009.\n\n\u201cOur key priority for 2020 is to expand into new markets,\u201d confirmed Manu\nKhetan, founder and CEO of Rolling Arrays, when speaking to _Channel Asia_.\n\u201cWith expanding and entering new markets, we intend to continue establishing\nthat we are the de facto leader in HR transformation being a true\nSuccessFactors implementation provider.\n\n\u201cWith years of great expertise, experience and a good installed base of happy\ncustomers, we aim to capitalise on the fact that we are the early movers into\nthe industry and have an upper hand in HR tech transformation space.\u201d\n\nPart of SAP since 2012 - [following a $3.4 billion\nacquisition](https://venturebeat.com/2011/12/03/sap-acquires-successfactors-\nfor-3-4-billion/) \\- SuccessFactors operates as a provider of human capital\nmanagement (HCM) software with a user base in excess of 120 million, serving\nover 7000 customers in the process.\n\n\u201cSuccessFactors as a product is going places and customers are adopting it,\u201d\nKhetan added. \u201cWe want to ensure our existing and new customers get the\nmaximum value out of it. Businesses are changing every day and all customers\nacross the globe need instant solutions to their business requirements.\u201d\n\nConsequently, Khetan said software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions are replacing\n\u201cbespoke and on-premises software\u201d across the world, as customer behaviour\npatterns change.\n\n\u201cAs a HR SaaS expert, all our consultants must possess equal expertise in\nlatest technology, HR best practices and consulting skills to understand,\nrecommend and implement the right solution for our customers,\u201d Khetan\nexplained. \u201cGone are the times where there are different teams for functional,\ntechnical and infrastructure streams.\u201d\n\nThe business - which has delivered more than 150 HR transformation projects\nfor over 75 blue-chip customers across Asia - first partnered with SAP in\n2010, kick-starting a decade of providing specialised consulting and\nimplementation services specific to HR.\n\n[![](https://d2bs8hqp6qvsw6.cloudfront.net/dimg/120x120/dimg/dreamstime_s_160047389.jpg)](https://sg.channelasia.tech/article/670477/pwc-\njoins-partner-ecosystem-sap-owned-qualtrics/) **Read more** [PwC joins partner\necosystem of SAP-owned\nQualtrics](https://sg.channelasia.tech/article/670477/pwc-joins-partner-\necosystem-sap-owned-qualtrics/)\n\n\u201cThe approach that has distinguished us among our competitors is that we live\nand breathe the ideology that every business is unique and so are our\nsolutions to it,\u201d Khetan said. \u201cWe take a project, big or small, with utmost\nsincerity to solve the problem the company or department faced before they\ndecide to embark on an RFP or RFI process.\n\n\u201cWe get to the heart of the business needs, understand their unique\nrequirements to achieve HR transformation, and thus empower a business to\nrespond intuitively to evolving market dynamics.\n\n\u201cHence, it\u2019s a game-changing spree with us from suggesting a solution,\nimplementing it right and helping customers to derive maximum value post\nimplementation.\u201d\n\n **Evolving tech**\n\n[![](https://d2bs8hqp6qvsw6.cloudfront.net/dimg/120x120/dimg/sutas_kongdumrongkiat_ntt_thailand_1.jpg)](https://sg.channelasia.tech/article/670472/ntt-\nrolls-sap-thai-manufacturing-transformation-project/) **Read more** [NTT rolls\nout SAP in Thai manufacturing transformation\nproject](https://sg.channelasia.tech/article/670472/ntt-rolls-sap-thai-\nmanufacturing-transformation-project/)\n\nWhen searching through Gartner analyst reports assessing future trends, the\ndirection of travel for HR technology becomes clear; this is a\n[\u201cthriving\u201d](https://www.sagepeople.com/about-us/news-hub/hcm-market-guide-\ngartner/#) market.

As such, HR teams across Asia are continuing to\ninvest in HR transformation projects that are aimed at digitalising and\nstreamlining their HR functions and ultimately improving employee experience.\nIncreasing numbers of HR teams are rolling out global or regional human\ncapital management systems and exploring ways in which robotic process\nautomation and HR technology can be used to automate their administrative\ntasks and elevate the impact the HR team has in the organisation.\n\n**2\\. Strong IT job market to continue**  \nIT projects across Asia continue to see stable investment and as such IT\ncandidates remain in hot demand. While the IT job market is one of the only\njob markets not significantly affected by the US/China trade war and other\neconomic uncertainty, IT candidates are showing a decreasing appetite to\nchange roles which means companies are having to fight harder to attract IT\ncandidates.\n\n**3\\. HR leaders focused on cost optimisation**  \nRecent research shows that 92% of HR leaders are now prioritising budgeting\nand cost optimisation initiatives in light of the uncertain economic\nenvironment. However, the same research shows only 20% of these HR leaders are\nreported to be considering the impact of these initiatives on the\norganisation\u2019s overall efforts.\n\nWhile larger corporations have been decentralising HR in recent years to more\nspecialised functions, some have shifted back to more centralised hubs as a\nmeans to gain more control and reduce costs. The rise of start-ups has also\nincreased the demand for HR generalists who can act as a business partner and\nlook after office setup, talent acquisition, compensation and benefits and\npossess knowledge of the employment ordinance.  \n**4.Senior roles being moved out of Hong Kong  \n**To mitigate risks and continue to attract foreign talent, increasing numbers\nof companies with a regional presence are shifting the headcount for senior\nroles out of Hong Kong and China and into other business hubs like Singapore.  \n**5\\. Taiwan and South East Asia win big**  \nWhile the US/China trade war and economic uncertainty significantly impacted\ntraditional powerhouse economies like Singapore, China and Hong Kong,\norganisations with businesses in countries like Vietnam and Taiwan have been\nbig winners, with increased trade and investment and business growth off the\nback of the trade war. In addition, some local firms in China are reporting\nstronger growth from decreased competition as MNC\u2019s in China redirect their\ninvestment elsewhere.\n\n**Best HR response during uncertain economic times:  \n****1\\. Cost cutting while keeping long-term goals in sight  \n**- Re-examination and prioritisation of current services across functions  \n- Reallocation of current resources  \n- Implementation of dedicated activities to drive immediate cost savings  \n- Build infrastructures that allow for cost savings in the long run (such as AI & automation technology, outsourcing)  \n**2\\. Honest and open communications to boost loyalty and retention when cost\ncutting  \n****3\\. Protect your long-term employer brand when cutting costs**\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\n### _Whether mid-career or moving towards retirement, anyone in HR should look\nahead to what could be a very satisfying next chapter working on a board,\naffirms Jenny Dearborn._\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a coincidence.\n\nTwo surprising things happened after I left the corporate world earlier this\nyear, launching a consulting practice after 20+ years as a human capital\nmanagement executive.\n\nFirst, corporate boards began to realise that [their workforce is the real key\nto sustainable long-term growth](https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-\nroundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-\nserves-all-americans) (something those of us in HR have known all along).\nSecond, I began to realise that it is directly from the board room that\npractical change flows (something I wish I\u2019d understood much better when I was\nan executive).\n\nThe third thing \u2013 not so much a surprise as a welcome breath of fresh air \u2013 is\nthe mandate now sweeping countries to include more women on corporate boards.\n\nAll of this positions HR executives, especially women, to start preparing\nright now for a future board role. Whether mid-career or moving towards\nretirement, anyone in HR should look ahead to what could be a very satisfying\nnext chapter.\n\n### **Boards need us**\n\nWhat makes me think corporate boards will be actively recruiting HR execs at\nan accelerating rate?\n\nInstitutional investors are sending loud messages. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink,\nwho heads the world\u2019s largest asset management company, called HCM \u201ca\ncompetitive advantage\u201d and urged CEOs in [his 2018\nletter](https://www.blackrock.com/hk/en/insights/larry-fink-ceo-letter) to\nbetter support their employees, including through retraining in the face of\nautomation. BlackRock\u2019s [guidance on HCM\npractices](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/publication/blk-\ncommentary-engagement-on-human-capital.pdf) emphasises boards are just as\nresponsible as management for carrying them out.\n\n> ##### It takes time to get board-ready, and deliberate effort to switch your\n> mindset from being a functional expert to an advisor/coach.\n\n### **A leg-up for women**\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that most HR professionals are women \u2013 so it\u2019s encouraging that\nas HCM becomes a corporate priority, concrete progress toward increasing\nfemale board representation is also underway.\n\nLast year, my home state broke new ground, requiring every California-\nheadquartered company to include at least one woman on its board by year-end\n2019, with larger boards requiring greater representation by 2021. Although\n[Senate Bill\n826](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB826)\nfaces legal challenges, [other states are following\nsuit](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=acb88592-7f88-4b7e-9684-158702e10663).\n\nAnd it benefits the bottom line. Research shows organisations with gender-\ndiverse leadership are [more likely to have sustainable\ngrowth](https://www.ddiworld.com/glf2018/diversity-leaders), [higher average\nrevenue](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236543/business-benefits-gender-\ndiversity.aspx) and profits, and [report higher earnings per\nshare](https://www.msci.com/www/blog-posts/the-tipping-point-women-\non/0538249725) than businesses without female board directors.\n\nMore encouragement: This proxy season, BlackRock [voted against\ndirectors](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackrock-stewardship/blackrock-\ntakes-aim-at-ceos-serving-on-other-companies-boards-idUSKCN1VH16M) at 52\ncompanies because their boards lacked diversity, including gender, ethnicity\nand age, reporting that diverse groups make better decisions.\n\n### **Getting started**\n\nIt takes time to get board-ready, and deliberate effort to switch your mindset\nfrom being a functional expert to an advisor/coach. Start now, first\ninvestigating what a board role requires, so you can decide if you\u2019d enjoy and\nexcel at it. Key initial steps:\n\n  1. **Study up.** Consume books, blogs, videos, board documents, annual reports, and more. I found these especially valuable: \n    * Books: _[The Future of Boards](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-future-of-boards): Meeting the Governance Challenges of the Twenty-First Century_, and _[Boards That Lead](http://www.ram-charan.com/books/boards-lead/): When to Take Charge, When to Partner and When to Stay out of the Way_.\n    * Videos: Stanford Rock Center for Corporate Governance [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAED8EE8EB2560ECA) and National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/NACDVideos1)\n    * Email newsletters: From sources like the organisations below\n    * Articles like [this series](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2018/01/16/want-to-join-a-corporate-board-heres-how-part-one/#1a44e4722dd4)\n  2. **Join associations.** Take advantage of all they have to offer. A few suggestions: \n    * [Athena Alliance](https://www.youtube.com/user/NACDVideos1) can help you think through the best role, industry and board for you (private, private equity-backed, venture capital-backed, public or non-profit).\n    * [NACD](https://www.nacdonline.org/) offers great classes and certifications.\n    * Local board networking groups via your alma mater and/or nearby business or law schools. I attend the [Silicon Valley Directors\u2019 Exchange](https://www.svdx.org/), near me.\n  3. **Attend** **training** : \n    * Seek out development sessions sponsored by professional search firms, consulting firms and venture capital firms.\n    * Once you\u2019ve laid a solid foundation, consider an intensive, multi-day corporate board preparation course like those offered by top business and law schools.\n  4. **Women, seek out specialised opportunities:**\n    * Dive into books on [thriving as a woman in a board position](https://www.amazon.com/Women-Board-Insider-Succeeding-Director/dp/0692262946).\n    * Take advantage of [educational resources](http://broadrooms.com/director-education/) for women leaders.\n    * Seek out nonprofits that prepare exceptional women for board service and/or help match women with board openings, including [Alliance of Women Directors](https://www.allianceofwomendirectors.org/), [the Boardlist](https://theboardlist.com/), [The Boston Club](http://www.thebostonclub.com/), [Catalyst Women on Board](https://www.catalyst.org/solution/catalyst-women-on-board/), [DirectWomen](http://www.directwomen.org/), [How Women Lead](https://www.howwomenlead.com), [onBoarding Women](https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/onboarding-women.html), [Women2Boards](https://women2boards.com/), and [Women in the Boardroom](https://womenintheboardroom.com).\n\nThe more I study boards, the more I wish I had realised their importance when\nI was an executive. Boards need you, and if you have the passion, insights and\ndrive to succeed in leadership roles, you\u2019ll want more challenges after you\nleave corporate employment.\n\nAnd remember: any insights you gain, whether or not you aim to become a board\ndirector, will help you become more strategic and valuable to your\norganisation throughout your tenure. You\u2019ll become even more effective at what\nyou and I have known all along is essential to business performance:\nthoughtful, planful and effective human capital management.\n\n* * *\n\n_The author, Jenny Dearborn is the CEO of Actionable Analytics Group, and has\nbeen recognised as one of the Top 50 Most Powerful Women in Tech.

bounds,\nand students are trying to stay above the tide in a competitive business\nlandscape.\n\nOverflowing access to data insights and information enables global\ninstitutions to outsmart their competitors, to prepare for upcoming industry\ntrends and to make informed decisions that drive organisational success.\n\nWith an influx of business analytics opportunities surrounding this valuable\ndata, many are seeking Master\u2019s programmes that will equip them with both\ntechnical skills and business strategies needed to make effective strategic\nrecommendations for companies.\n\nGlobal data analytics and advisory firm,\n[Quantzig](https://www.quantzig.com/blog/importance-business-\nanalytics?utm_source=Bv1.3W45&utm_medium=BWQ4Bv1.3&utm_campaign=BWQ4Bv1.3&utm_term=business%20analytics&utm_content=top%20reasons%20behind%20the%20growing%20importance%20of%20business%20analytics%20that%20you%20must%20know),\ndelivers actionable analytics solutions to resolve complex business problems\nand recently released the top reasons behind the growing importance of\nbusiness analytics they believe everyone should know.\n\n\u201cIt helps in understanding the available primary and secondary data more\ncomprehensively, which, in turn, affects the operational efficiency of several\ndepartments in the organisation. It helps in having a competitive edge, and it\nincorporates the data available with several thought models to enhance\nbusiness decisions.\n\n![4156f1ac-25e8-11e7-8525-012b618af2d3\n](https://cdn.studyinternational.com/news/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/4156f1ac-25e8-11e7-8525-012b618af2d3.jpg)\n\nSource: Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies,\nUniversity of Chicago\n\n\u201cIn addition, it converts available data into valuable information and helps\nin attaining the desired outcome and positive results for the organisation,\u201d\nthey note.\n\nNoting that the subject area is extremely important for the economy,\nespecially for those who want to take part in shaping some of the most popular\nproducts in today\u2019s business landscape, Quantzig knows that interest in\nbusiness analytics is booming, and the field is ideal for aspiring industry\ninnovators.\n\nBringing out the best skills, technologies and practices for continuous\niterative exploration, business analytics not only allow companies to develop\ntheir outreach and scope, but it also expands learners\u2019 professional outlook\nand personal development.\n\nThe bridge that connects business to insight, business analytics provide\nvaluable knowledge from data through decision-making techniques, machine\nlearning, algorithms for big data and natural language techniques for social\nmedia analytics.\n\n_Here are four universities that bring practical business analytics courses to\naspiring data professionals\u2026_\n\n### **[ORFALEA COLLEGE OF BUSINESS, CALIFORNIA POLYTECHNIC STATE UNIVERSITY\n(CAL POLY)](https://gradbusiness.calpoly.edu/) **\n\nThe [Orfalea College of

with business strategy to transform students into\ndata-savvy leaders for in-demand analytics careers.\n\n![4156f1ac-25e8-11e7-8525-012b618af2d3

State University\n\nIn keeping with the university\u2019s [Learn by Doing](https://giving.calpoly.edu/)\nphilosophy, MSBA students engage in the analysis of real-world problems and\ndata provided by the college\u2019s industry partners.\n\nThree projects provide students with valuable teamwork experience, client\nexposure and proven business successes to add to their professional portfolio.\n\nIn a recent discussion of the employment prospects of an MBSA on the [Oracle\nAnalytics Advantage Podcast](https://blogs.oracle.com/analyticscloud/how-\nuniversities-can-shape-the-future-of-business-analytics), Director of Business\nAnalytics Graduate Programs at the Cal Poly Orfalea College of Business, Kyle\nHofer-Mora explains how rewarding it has been to see graduates advance in a\nvariety of careers.\n\n\"A great thing about the analytics skillset is the applications of analytics\nacross every industry, which allows students with these specialised skills to\nfind an industry they are passionate about, or a functional domain in which\nthey have an interest such as marketing analytics, or HR/people analytics,\"\nHofer-Mora says.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in 2017, the university was ranked the [14th most recruited school\nby Silicon Valley](https://qz.com/967985/silicon-valley-companies-like-apple-\naapl-hires-the-most-alumni-of-these-10-universities-and-none-of-them-are-in-\nthe-ivy-league/) tech firms and why 75 percent of the companies that have\nsponsored projects at Cal Poly over the past three years have hired at least\none student from the MBSA.\n\nThe proximity of, and connections to, the Silicon Valley, with curricula\nshaped by industry professionals, makes Orfalea\u2019s MSBA an ideal choice for\naspiring business leaders.\n\n### **[GRAHAM SCHOOL OF CONTINUING LIBERAL AND PROFESSIONAL

This dilutes the efforts of\nHR which could be put to more valuable use if allocated to more strategic HR\nmanagement issues. To take this administrative burden off HR practitioners\u2019\nhands, many organisations are turning to recruitment process outsourcing (RPO)\npartners.\n\nHence, why, research by Technavio shows the RPO market in Asia Pacific is\nexpected to grow at a CAGR of over 21% between 2018-2022, driven by a need to\nimprove the HR value chain and compliance. Among the key RPO target sectors,\nBFSI held the largest market, accounting for nearly 30% of the share. However,\nby 2022, the manufacturing segment is expected to surpass the BFSI segment to\nbecome the leading segment, accounting for a share of 30%.\n\nThe winners and finalist of the **Best Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO)\nPartner** category at the [HR Vendors of the Year\n2019](https://awards.humanresourcesonline.net/voty-2019/),\n[Malaysia](https://awards.humanresourcesonline.net/voty-my-2019/) and\n[Singapore](https://awards.humanresourcesonline.net/voty-sg-2019/), are\norganisations which clearly take the administrative recruitment work off their\nclients, while performing the required job with top quality. If your RPO\npartner is among the firms on this list, you can be assured you\u2019re in safe\nhands.\n\n### [**Best Recruitment Process Outsourcing Partners \u2013\nMalaysia**](https://awards.humanresourcesonline.net/voty-my-2019/)\n\n**Winners:** **  \nGold:** KellyOCG  \n**Silver:** Cielo  \n**Bronze:** Alchemy Resources\n\n######  \n_Screengrab of interview with Andy Liu, General Manager, Alchemy Resources_\n\n### [**Best Recruitment Process Outsourcing Partners \u2013\nSingapore**](https://awards.humanresourcesonline.net/voty-sg-2019/)\n\n**Winners:** **  \nGold:** KellyOCG Singapore  \n**Silver:** Cielo  \n**Bronze:** Allegis Global Solutions\n\n**Finalist:**  \nSMS24/7\n\n* * *\n\n_**Want to know more about HR Vendors of the Year awards?**_\n\n  * _View all winners across[Malaysia](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/events/winners-and-photos-hr-vendors-of-the-year-2019-malaysia/) and [Singapore](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/events/winners-and-photos-hr-vendors-of-the-year-2019-singapore/)_\n  * _Photo gallery of the awards dinners held in[Malaysia](https://awards.humanresourcesonline.net/voty-my-2019/post-event-gallery) and [Singapore](https://awards.humanresourcesonline.net/voty-sg-2019/post-event-gallery)_\n  * _To participate in the 2020 awards or find out more, email:[event.info@humanresourcesonline.net](mailto:event.info@humanresourcesonline.net)_\n\n_Lead photo / Screengrab of interview with Andy Liu, General Manager, Alchemy\nResources_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

analytics,\nincluding Datalicious Korea._\n\nMartin Sorrell's digital marketing venture S4 Capital has added two new\nanalytics companies, to be merged with digital media consultancy MightyHive.\nBased out of London, ConversionWorks is described as a digital analytics,\nbiddable media and data science consultancy, while the second new acquisition,\nDatalicious Korea, is a South Korean firm specialised in data and analytics in\nthe marketing domain.\n\n\"One of the most substantial developments of the past couple decades has been\nAsia's integration into global trade, talent, and innovation. In the coming\ndecades, Asia's economies will go from participating in these flows to\ndetermining their shape and direction,\" the firm stated, [mimicking (almost\nverbatim](/news/2405/asia-to-account-for-half-of-all-global-gdp-in-under-a-\ngeneration)) a recent McKinsey report. [McKinsey](/firms/mckinsey-company\n\"McKinsey\"), incidentally, has its own digital marketing wing.\n\nBut as ad-land's push-back against [encroaching consultancies](/news/977/ad-\nagencies-tbwa-and-ogilvy-roll-out-consulting-arms-to-counter-encroachment)\nsuch as [Deloitte](/firms/deloitte \"Deloitte\") and\n[Accenture](/firms/accenture) continues, MightyHive - which was picked up by\nS4 Capital for $150 million at the end of last year and now operates in 15\ncountries, including through branches in Singapore, Tokyo, Jakarta, and Hong\nKong - stated that it was excited to accelerate its analytics capabilities\nwith the addition of the two 'respected' firms.\n\n![MightyHive adds analytics bolt-ons, including Datalicious\nKorea](/illustrations/news/detail/2019-10-28-141646252-MightyHive-adds-\nanalytics-bolt-ons_-including-Datalicious-Korea.jpg)\n\n\"Their stellar reputations in the respective regions naturally complement\nMightyHive's global consulting services as we continue to expand and prosper\nworldwide,\" said MightlyHive CEO and co-founder Peter Kim, who added;  \"First-\nparty data is part of the S4 Capital 'holy trinity' and these mergers support\nour strategic vision of creating the leading digital-only, new era marketing\nservices firm.\"\n\nTo be rebranded under the MightyHive banner, Datalicious Korea was established\nin Seoul in 2016 by local market 'analytics, social media ROI measurement, and\nsocial CRM' expert Sun-Young Kim, who will continue on as MightyHive's Korean\ncountry head. \"The Asia-Pacific is the world's fastest-growing economic region\nand we are thrilled to join the MightyHive operations locally,\" she stated.\n\n\"Almost 50 percent of MightyHive's offices are in Asia, and it's fitting that\nour first acquisition in the APAC region is in the critical market of South\nKorea,\" the marketing consultancy added in a press release, before getting\nstraight to the pitch; \"Some of the largest, most innovative marketers in the\nworld - Samsung, LG, and Hyundai - live here, and need help with their digital\ntransformation efforts.\"\n\n  * [ __](mailto:?&subject=MightyHive adds analytics bolt-ons, including Datalicious Korea&body=https://www.consultancy.asia/news/2656/mightyhive-adds-analytics-bolt-ons-including-datalicious-korea)\n  * [ __  \n](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.consultancy.asia/news/2656/mightyhive-\nadds-analytics-bolt-ons-including-datalicious-\nkorea&title=MightyHive+adds+analytics+bolt-\nons%2C+including+Datalicious+Korea&source=https://www.consultancy.asia/news/2656/mightyhive-\nadds-analytics-bolt-ons-including-datalicious-korea)\n\n  * [ __  \n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=MightyHive+adds+analytics+bolt-\nons%2C+including+Datalicious+Korea&url=https://www.consultancy.asia/news/2656/mightyhive-\nadds-analytics-bolt-ons-including-datalicious-korea&via=ConsultancyAsia)\n\n  * [ __  \n](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.consultancy.asia/news/2656/mightyhive-\nadds-analytics-bolt-ons-including-datalicious-korea)\n\n  * [ __  \n](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://www.consultancy.asia/news/2656/mightyhive-\nadds-analytics-bolt-ons-including-datalicious-korea)\n\n  \n\n## Latest news\n\n  * [Arthur D.

The talk addressed in depth, aspects of\nmanagement of a complex aircraft development program and its technologies.\n\nThere were about 90 delegates from industry, IISc and IMechE members. All the\nspeakers having extensive experience in Aerospace design, production and the\ntechnologies, it provided the delegates an insight to trends in aircraft\ndesign and  critical technologies.\n\n### IMechE AeD India Centre Learned Society Event 8 Feb 2020\n\n\n\nThe fifth learned society lecture series, on the theme of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), was held IMechE's Aerospace Division India Centre was held\nwith the support of IISc's Aerospace Engineering Department and the Society\nfor Shock Wave Research.\n\nThe first lecture was by Prof. Asim Tewari of IIT Mumbai.\n\nProf Tewari talk was on Artificial which is impacting all walks of human\nactivity, from employment to social relations, from wars to healthcare, from\nsecurity to privacy and personal freedom. He provided an overview of the\nadvancements and future of AI and need for an international consensus policy\non its development and use.\n\nHis talk covered cyber physical systems and data analytics, IOT devices and\nnetwork architecture, video analytics, RF data analysis for border\nsurveillance, deep learning algorithms for detecting cancer, third wave of AI,\nnatural language processing, and artificial super intelligence.  \n\nThe next talk was by Prof SN Omkar Chief Research Scientist at the IISc. He is\nthe head of Computational Intelligence, the Unmanned Aerial vehicles and the\nBiomechanics laboratories at the IISc.\n\nProf Omkar spoke about variety and types of drones in diverse applications and\nrole of AI in management of data collected by drones.\n\nThe third lecture was by Dr Suresh Sundaram an associate professor in\nDepartment of Aerospace Engineering, Indian Institute of Science. His current\nresearch interests include flight control, unmanned aerial vehicle design,\nmachine learning, and optimization and computer vision.\n\nThe talk addressed cognitive team theoretic approach to handle the dynamic\nairspace management (CDAM) under sudden weather development.\n\nFirst, CDAM determines optimal sector shape in 3-dimensions such that the air-\ntraffic controller conflicting workloads are balanced and changes in sector\nshape over time horizon is marginal.\n\nCDAM comprises of two major components namely, a cognitive engine and a\nmetacognitive decision maker. The cognitive engine consists of an airspace\nsectorisation model and multi-objective optimization solver. The metacognitive\ndecision maker utilises the Pareto optimal front obtained from the cognitive\nengine along ATC requirements and forecasted traffic pattern, It identifies\nthe best solution that can be implemented and also develop a rule to decide\nwhen-to-do re-sectorisation.\n\nThe lecture addressed simultaneous dynamic airspace sectorisation and dynamic\nrouting problem to handle the sudden changes in weather conditions.\n\nThe performance of CDAM was evaluated using traffic data over Singapore flight\ninformation region and provided suggestions for better sector shape and\nmanagement.\n\nThe talk was technically intensive and rather interesting in content.\n\nThere were about 70 delegates from Industry, IISc and IMechE members.\n\nThe lecture series are providing a good exposure to IMechE members in diverse\nareas of aerospace design, engineering and technologies. The speakers are all\nexperts in their fields with rich experience.\n\nShare:\n\n## Read more related articles\n\n  * [Aerospace](/news?topic=aerospace)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n## Professional Engineering magazine\n\n### [](/news?pe-magazine=pe-articles,readers-letters,comment-\nanalysis)[](https://www.imeche.org/news?pe-magazine=pe-articles,readers-\nletters,comment-analysis)[](/news?pe-magazine=pe-articles,readers-\nletters,comment-analysis)[](http://www.imeche.org/news?pe-magazine=pe-\narticles,readers-letters,comment-analysis)[](/news?pe-magazine=pe-\narticles,readers-letters,comment-analysis)Current Issue:\n[Issue](http://www.imeche.org/news?pe-magazine=pe-articles,readers-\nletters,comment-analysis) 2, 2020\n\n[![Issue 2 cover online](/images/default-source/default-album/issue-2-cover-\nonline.tmb-thumbnail.png?sfvrsn=1)](/news?pe-magazine=pe-articles,readers-\nletters,comment-analysis)\n\n  * [](https://www.imeche.org/news/news-article/soaring-twenties-drones-pick-up-tools-but-electric-flight-a-long-way-off)Rocket Man takes off\n  * How gauge studies get it wrong\n  * A heart pump out of space\n  * The last land speed record? \n  * Automotive sector seeks sustainability   \n\n**[View all](http://www.imeche.org/news?pe-magazine=pe-articles,readers-\nletters,comment-analysis) **\n\n### [Professional Engineering app](/news/peapp)\n\n![](/images/default-source/agenda-images/pe-app-on-a-tablet.jpg)\n\n  * Industry features and content\n  * Engineering and Institution news\n  * News and features exclusive to app users\n\n[**Download the Professional Engineering app**](/news/peapp)\n\n### [Professional Engineering\nnewsletter](http://imeche.msgfocus.com/k/Wanderlust/pe_signup)\n\nA weekly round-up of the most popular and topical stories featured on our\nwebsite, so you won't miss anything\n\n[**Subscribe to the Professional Engineering\nnewsletter**](http://imeche.msgfocus.com/k/Wanderlust/pe_signup)\n\n**[Opt into your industry sector newsletter](/my-account/my-\nprofile/ProfileMailingPref)**\n\n**Javascript Disabled**\n\nPlease enable Javascript on your browser to view our news.\n\n## Related articles\n\n  * \n\n[\n\n## Exclusive member offers\n\nServices for home and work\n\n](/exclusive-member-offers)\n\n[\n\n## Heritage awards\n\nRecognising engineering excellence\n\n](/engineering-heritage-awards)\n\n[\n\n## Support Network\n\nFinancial help and personal support\n\n](/support-network/)\n\nImproving the world through engineering\n\n  * [About us](/about-us)\n  * [Contact us](/contact-us)\n\n## Follow us\n\n  * [ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/imeche)\n  * [ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/imeche)\n  * [ YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/user/imecheuk)\n\n## Also available:\n\n[\n\n### Venue and room hire\n\nFlexible spaces at our head office in Westminster, London\n\n](//www.onebirdcagewalk.com/)\n\n[\n\n### IMechE Argyll Ruane\n\nHelping NDT professionals obtain, renew or upgrade their qualifications\n\n](//argyllruane.imeche.org )\n\n[\n\n### Sonaspection\n\nInternationally recognised manufacturer of flawed specimens in the NDT and NDE\nindustries\n\n](//sonaspection.com)\n\n(C) 2020 Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

Is HR\nready to meet the industry's needs?\n\n![Malaysia's top employment trends 2020](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637121995088596299.jpg)\n\nBY [Nurhuda Syed](/asia/authors/nurhuda-syed) 18 Dec 2019\n\nShare\n\nMalaysia's efforts to digitalise the nation will likely have the greatest\nimpact on employment trends in 2020, according to a new study.\n\nTech-savvy professionals can even look forward to a 10% to 22% salary jump\nwhen switching jobs within similar industries.\n\nBesides digital skills, greater tech understanding will help professionals go\nfurther in the new year.\n\n**Digital talent to support fintech 's exponential growth**  \nMalaysia will continue to push towards becoming a cashless society, and all\nthe industry sectors and employment skills will be required to support this.\n\nFor one fintech is set to grow at an accelerated rate, according to Michael\nPage's research. Therefore, demand for tech-savvy professionals with\nexperience in e-money and blockchain technologies will continue to be strong.\n\nBringing financial services and technology together requires a hybrid of\nspecialised skills, said Nic Chambers, regional director at Michael Page\nMalaysia.\n\nTo optimise operations, he added that professionals need to have strong\ndecision-making as well as risk management skills. Workers would also need to\nbe able to handle tasks and technology to do with credit scoring, anti-money\nlaundering and predictive analytics.\n\n[READ MORE: Myopic hiring worsening tech

[COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n**Increasing need for cybersecurity experts**  \nWith the exponential growth of fintech, cashless payments and availability of\nonline data, digital ethics and privacy will become a larger concern for\nconsumers, organisations and government bodies.\n\nTherefore, job opportunities in digital banking and cybersecurity will rise as\nmore experts are required.\n\n**Boom in analytics and AI**  \nAs more companies in Malaysia move into predictive marketing, organisations\nwill utilise new tech platforms to stay ahead in the fast-changing consumer\nlandscape.\n\nProfessionals skilled in augmented analytics, AI-driven development and\nmachine learning will thus be in strong demand.\n\n### Related stories\n\n  * [Malaysia leads Asia in this key HR issue](/asia/news/general/malaysia-leads-asia-in-this-key-hr-issue/173790)\n  *

Flexible working is no longer the novelty, it's the norm.\n\nThe number of people working from home in China is set to explode. Currently,\nmost employees in China are still on holiday for the Lunar New Year. However\nas companies on the mainland resume operations, it\u2019s likely to trigger the\nglobe\u2019s biggest-ever work-from-home experiment.\n\nThat means organisations will need to get creative to ensure their employees\ncan stay in touch with clients and colleagues, and that businesses can still\ntick over.\n\nOrganising client meetings and group discussions via videochat apps, or\ntalking business strategy on software platforms such as WeChat Work will\nbecome _de rigueur_ \u2013 at least until the coronavirus outbreak subsides.\n\nWhile shops, hotels and restaurants in China are concerned about a plunge in\ncustomer traffic, and factories remain closed, businesses across the country\nare trying to come to grips with how to stay functional and competitive in a\nvirtual world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity for us to test working from home at scale. Obviously,\nnot easy for a creative ad agency that brainstorms a lot in person. It\u2019s going\nto mean a lot of video chats and phone calls,\u201d Alvin Foo, managing director of\nReprise Digital, a Shanghai ad agency with a headcount of 400, told the\n_SCMP_.\n\nMeanwhile in Hong Kong \u2013 where the Lunar New Year break concluded a week ago \u2013\ncompanies are also embracing a work-from-home approach for employees.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s 170,000-plus army of civil servants were among the first to be\ndirected to work remotely, while many private organisations have since\nfollowed suit, giving employees the option to work from home \u2013 as the city\nstrives to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

What's worse, is there is an ever-present risk that\nsmall errors here can lead to big (and even more time-consuming) disputes and\nissues later down the track.\n\nThat's why specialised software can be such an important tool for HR\nprofessionals of all levels. Taking that difficult and risk-heavy task out of\nthe in-tray through an automated system gives HR leaders much greater\nopportunity to concentrate on building effective and productive cultures\nacross their workforce.

There is a significant trend\nof HR Technologies (HRTech) moving away from being just compliance-driven\nsystems to tools that provide actionable insights for better talent\nengagement.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834c096babe.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n**HR Tech News:** [ASU/GSV Education Summit Announces Andrew Temte as\nPanelist](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/learning-development/asugsv-\neducation-summit-announces-andrew-temte-as-panelist/)\n\nIt might be noted that Singapore has traditionally been seen as a laggard in\nHRTech adoption, but the scenario seems to be fast changing. These HRTech\ntools are now helping enterprises hire, train, engage and retain employees\nbetter.\n\nThe details of all these providers have been published in the recently\nreleased Singapore HRTech Market Map (2019). The market map which is\ncomprehensive in terms of its coverage is a collaborative research product of\nAdrian Tan, renowned HRTech blogger, and hrtech.sg, a Singapore-based boutique\nHRTech advisory and analyst firm.\n\nThe market map has categorized the service providers across seven major Talent\nsegments: Talent Acquisition (Employer Branding, Recruitment), Talent\nEngagement (Employer Onboarding, Performance Management), Talent Rewards\n(Compensation & Benefits), Talent Development (Training), Talent Analytics,\nTalent Operations (Automation & Shared Services), and finally, Human Resource\nManagement Systems (HRMS).\n\n\u201cThere are two key factors for the rapid growth of HRTech players servicing\nthe Singapore talent marketplace. Firstly, the productivity focus of the\nSingapore government is nudging enterprises to adopt digital HR systems faster\nand better.

for HR pros to get their business claws into. By Jeffrey Towson,\na Professor of Investment at Peking University Guanghua School of\nManagement**_\n\nI really like cheetahs. I\u2019m not totally sure why. But I have watched every\ndocumentary I can find about them. I have studied their biology. I frequently\ngo to see them in the wild in Kenya and South Africa. I just think they are\nreally cool.\n\nAnd I also recall Berkshire Hathaway Vice-Chairman Charlie Munger talking\nabout how business is an ecosystem like nature. And in both, hyper-\nspecialisation seems to be key for long-term survival and success. For\nexample, giraffes have their long necks to reach the high leaves. Turtles have\ntheir protective shells. Birds are singularly evolved for flight. And cheetahs\nare built for speed and acceleration.\n\nIt\u2019s about hyper-specialisation. You don\u2019t evolve to do three or four things\nwell. You don\u2019t have both wings, a long neck and a shell. You evolve to do one\nthing really, really well. And you give up the other things.\n\nA cool cheetah factoid: They can go from zero to 60 mph in three strides (and\nin about three seconds). A couple thoughts on cheetahs and how hyper-\nspecialisation benefits businesses.\n\n**Organisations that prosper long-term are hyper-specialised in one or two\nactivities. Know what one or two skills you will survive and thrive based\non.**\n\nWhat I find fascinating is how most every part of a cheetah\u2019s anatomy is\nadapted for speed and acceleration. Its claws don\u2019t retract like the other big\ncats, so they can be used like cleats. Its tail is a counter-weight for sharp\nturns. And its collarbones don\u2019t attach to the spine, so its stride is longer.\n\nHow many businesses can you think of where almost every aspect is specialised\ntoward just one or two key activities? For me, one company that comes to mind\nis Costco, which is specialised for low costs. They operate as a warehouse \u2013\nand have basically eliminated the retail step in the supply chain. In their\nwarehouse / store, they load the goods on the shelves while still on palettes\n(and with forklifts). They even use skylights so they can save money on\nlights. From top to bottom, the business is hyper-specialised to cheap.\n\n**Hyper-specialisation means giving up other activities. Be able to say no\nquickly.**\n\nCheetahs gave up a lot for their acceleration. They are the lightest of the\ncats and have limited jaw and body strength. So they are too small to go after\nzebras (well, not alone anyway). They can only really run for about 17 seconds\nbefore they over-heat. They can\u2019t even really roar like the other big cats.\nThey kind of chirp.\n\nI think you have the same trade-offs in business. If you want to be a discount\nairline, you have to get rid of the expensive hub-and-spoke operations and\nmultiple aircraft types. You have to give up lots of routes. You have to give\nup certain types of customers. Starbucks resists the idea of selling most\nanything but coffee. No real sandwiches. No kitchen. A management consultant\nused to always tell me that you could tell who had a clear strategy by how\nquickly they could say \u201cno\u201d to something.\n\n**Hyper-specialisation is only an advantage in certain situations. Know your\nniche.**\n\nYou\u2019ll note that cheetahs focus on gazelles, the one prey that the other big\ncats can\u2019t catch. Being hyper-specialised is usually only of value if it gives\nyou an advantage over your competitors and against a specific customer or\nmarket niche. Being a super-fast cat isn\u2019t really an advantage against\nrabbits. You can catch them but so can lots of other animals (plus they go\ninto holes). You have to know where your niche gives you an advantage over\nothers.\n\n**Even with a clear competitor and market niche, hyper-specialisation still\nonly works in specific circumstances.**\n\nThe cheetah can only run fast for about 17 seconds. And the gazelle can run\nfast for much longer. So the cheetah only catches the gazelle if it can sneak\nin close enough before it makes its charge. Cheetahs succeed in this about 3\nout of 4 times, which is pretty high (note: when tigers charge, they only win\nabout 1 in 20 times.).\n\nSo the specific conditions matter. For example, cheetahs struggle in the dry\nseason because the grass dies and they can\u2019t sneak in close enough without\nbeing spotted. It\u2019s the same in business. You have your specialisation, but\nyou still need a couple specific scenarios to win.\n\nFor example, a Costco store needs a certain customer volume before its \u201cunit\ncost per transaction\u201d drops below its competitors. So it doesn\u2019t work in areas\nwithout enough urban density. You have to know your winning situation.\n\n_**Jeffrey Towson, Professor of Investment,**_  \n_**Peking University Guanghua School of Management**_  \n[_**jefftowson.com**_](http://jefftowson.com)\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

Jerene\nAng\")\n\n## Suite Talk: Why managers shouldn't be afraid to say \"I don\u2019t know\", affirms\nPMI's regional President\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/). Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\n### While it takes a healthy dose of humility, saying \"I don\u2019t know\" is an\nopportunity to turn to others for answers, insights, knowledge and wisdom,\naffirms Stacey Kennedy _, President, South & Southeast Asia Region, Philip\nMorris International._\n\n### Q How would you describe your journey with Philip Morris International so\nfar? What has been your most memorable moment with the organisation?\n\nIt\u2019s been an extremely challenging and gratifying 24 years with the company.\nFrom day one, I\u2019ve loved the people and the company. I began as a territory\nsales manager, thinking that I would do this for a year or two. Cut to 24\nyears\u2014and many roles\u2014later, I\u2019m still here.\n\nThere have been many, many big moments for me within this company, but the\nmost memorable would have to be the pride I felt when making our announcement\nthat we are transitioning PMI to smoke-free products and leading the charge to\ndesign a smoke-free future for our world. There are millions of legal age\nsmokers who would otherwise continue to smoke who deserve information about\nand access to better alternatives. My job is to get smokers in South and\nSoutheast Asia this information and access. This is quite a change from my job\ndescription a couple of decades ago, and I welcome it.\n\n### Q I understand that you believe a powerful sentence in the workplace is \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know.\u201d Why?\n\nYes, I do, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re taught when we\u2019re in school, and later in\nthe workplace, that we have to have an answer for every question. Especially\nif you\u2019re a manager. A stigma has developed around saying \"I don\u2019t know,\" and\nit\u2019s time to change that and to start to see \"I don\u2019t know\" as an opportunity\nfor us to turn to others for answers, insights, knowledge and wisdom. It takes\na healthy dose of humility, but that\u2019s how we make ourselves, our colleagues\nand our companies smarter and stronger \u2014 what we don\u2019t know is what we need to\nlearn.\n\n### Q Having worked across the US, Europe, and Asia, what differences do you\nobserve in each region - in terms of talent as well as the pace of change and\ntransformation?\n\nThe entrepreneurial spirit and rate and pace of change in Indonesia, India,\nVietnam and many of the markets where I work today, and particularly in\ndigital and tech economies, is pretty phenomenal. It\u2019s much more obvious than\neven in Europe or more developed countries because, there, it\u2019s in the\nbackground. We know the rate of change the world over, but it\u2019s not so in your\nface every day. That\u2019s really unique to Asia. The other thing I\u2019ve noticed\nabout Asia is that the speed to market is amazing. It shows the absolute\nhunger of entrepreneurs in Asia to be able to bring new products to market.\n\n### Q You were appointed to a VP role when you were just 32, making you the\nyoungest VP ever appointed at Philip Morris. What was your secret to success?\n\nI think my \u201csecret\u201d is my natural tendency to be a searcher and to push\nboundaries outwards, as opposed to retreating inwards. I have a natural\ncuriosity that drives me to engage in conversations with others around this\nbusiness, rather than retreating into my own bunker. That\u2019s been a\ndifferentiator.\n\nI would also say I\u2019ve benefited from thinking in what I call \u201cstrategy mode.\u201d\nOften human nature is to think very incrementally. We\u2019re always trying to get\nat what is the smartest way to get to from point A to point B. But what I\u2019m\nalways looking for is a quantum leap. Is there a completely different way\u2014not\nto hop from letter to letter to letter to get from A to Z, but to make one\nmassive leap forward?\n\n### Q Being the first-ever female President of Asia Pacific operations for\nPhilip Morris International, and a mother of twin daughters, what career\nadvice do you have for young women looking to climb the career ladder?\n\nI think women, and all people, can upskill themselves tremendously by just\nengaging in conversation. Lessons can come from anywhere and anyone. There are\nalways new people to meet and new cultures to understand\u2014and that\u2019s\ninformation you can take with you and allow to inform your path in life.\n\nAs for balancing a career and motherhood, what I\u2019ve found most helpful is to\ntake down the walls between the two. I try to take my daughters along with me\non as many business trips as I can, and I often talk to them about work. If\nthey know I have a big presentation the next day, for instance, we\u2019ll even\nrole play where they\u2019re firing questions at me. They like to get in my\nbusiness and understand what it is I\u2019m trying to accomplish, and I love that.\nI think it\u2019s important for our kids to know what their parents do and what\ncontributions we\u2019re making. Most adults need to work to earn an income, and\nkids can understand this. But more importantly, positioning work as fulfilment\nis key to role model for children. \u201cIf you do what you love, you\u2019ll always\nlove what you do.\u201d\n\n### Q What do you think organisations can do to empower more women leaders\nlike yourself?\n\nIt\u2019s the responsibility of an organisation to consider how to create an\nenvironment that is conducive for each member of the team to bring his or her\nbest self to work. For too long, women in leadership have felt the need to\nblend in with what can often be a very homogenous group of male peers and\nsuperiors. I tried to play it that way at first myself, to pretend I was one\nof the gang, but that was absolutely the wrong mentality. That was a huge\nlearning insight for me because by trying to fit in, the company didn\u2019t derive\nthe full value of my differences.\n\nI take accountability for part of that myself because I think that each and\nevery one of us has to ask ourselves, \u201cAm I being my best authentic self? How\nam I bringing my best self to this team and to my work?\u201d But it also goes both\nways; organisations should be inviting and encouraging their female employees\nto be authentically themselves and to be in conversation about their different\nperspectives.\n\nThe more that a company can turn those insights from conversation into\nactions, the better off they are because then they can actually change and\nderive more value from their employees\u2019 differences. And that\u2019s true of gender\ndifferences, background differences, even different strengths of intellectual\nand emotional capability.\n\nI also think organisations need to know the business case for diversity \u2014 to\nsee that focusing on gender diversity and inclusion creates a more sustainable\nbusiness and allows companies to derive their employees\u2019 full value, and is\nworth investing in. For example, we put in a lot of work to ensure PMI\u2019s\nrecent global EQUAL-SALARY certification\u2014we are the first multinational to\nearn the certification. It's been a very exciting time of growth and\ndevelopment for us, and it\u2019s signaled all our commitment to all of our\nemployees.\n\n### Q What is your view of human resources as a business function? How closely\ndo you work with your HR head and on what kind of issues?\n\nThe partnership between HR and general management is critical. The pace of\nchange within the HR function is tremendous as it is in business, and today\nmore than ever, the critical skill sets in modern HR are very specialised, and\nwe need specialisation more than generalists.\n\nI have always believed that line management should be ultimately accountable\nfor the caliber and performance of the organisation, and that can only happen\nwith increasing effectiveness and efficiency of specialised skills in talent\nacquisition, retention, organisation design, OGSM (objectives, goals,\nstrategies and measures) performance management systems, leadership and skill\ndevelopment, increasing digitalisation of our HR systems and learning\nprograms, and much more.\n\n### Q Describe your ideal CHRO.\n\nI think one of the things that is desperately needed from all leaders, but\nperhaps for a CHRO in particular, is the ability to truly listen and to engage\nmore in the business. HR exists to support building the highest performance\nemployee team the business can afford, and those employees will serve\nconsumers \u2013 so the ideal CHRO knows what our consumer needs and journey are\nand how employees can best serve them.\n\n### Q If not this career, what alternative career path might you have chosen?\n\nI have no idea how realistic it would be, but on my short list of \"alternative\ncareers\" would be: international food critic and columnist, National\nGeographic photographer, and non-fiction author.\n\n_Photo / provided_\n\nHuman Resources magazine and the HR

Bulletin daily email newsletter:  \nAsia's only regional HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now

expectations on the roles of HR practitioners are\nshifting, as they are seeking a transitional position between HR and\nadministration, according to Robert Walters' recent research.\n\nThe top four skills in demand in the sector are: Business partnering, employee\nengagement, compensation and benefits, and learning and development.\n\nMore specifically, HR business partners with transformation experience or\ntalents who can offer strategic value and advice to the business are highly\nsought after \u2013 to engage in the trend of digital transformation and the\nrapidly changing business environment.\n\nStrong capability managers with branding expertise are also going to be in\nhigh demand, as there is a growing awareness of the importance and value of\nemployer branding in a highly competitive job market. They will be responsible\nfor leading organisations to meet the evolving expectations of both employees\nor potential candidates, as well retain and engage existing employees.\n\nAbout two thirds of respondents working in the HR field have been staying in\ntheir current roles for three to five years, and almost half (45%) of the\nrespondents are looking to change jobs in 2020 for better compensation and\nbenefits (73%), company culture (48%), career progression (45%), and improved\nwork-life balance (38%).\n\nMore than half of those who decide to stay expect between a 1-6% annual salary\nincrement, while 35% expect a 7-15% increase.\n\n**Salary Guide**\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/27120206/SKM_C25819112711510-page-001-220x180.jpg)\n\n**Other key findings in the report:**\n\n  * The expected salary increment when changing jobs next year in Hong Kong has dropped to 10-15% from 10-20% in 2019.\n  * In the current environment, both employers and candidates are more conservative, while talented professionals are less willing to jump between roles than in previous years.\n  * Recruitment remains highly active in financial services, particularly in the fintech sector. Despite a slowdown in hiring for trading and equity-related financial services positions, recruitment remained active for roles in virtual banking, insurtech, private banking, wealth management, distressed debt and special situations funds.\n  * High-tech companies and start-ups are continuously looking for the placement of strategic positions for innovation research in Hong Kong, which drives demand for talent specialised in data, innovation, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and software development.\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\nYesterday (15 October), United Overseas Bank (UOB) announced the launch of a\nholistic learning and development programme to help its more than 26,000\nemployees across the group build successful careers in the digital age.\n\nTitled 'Better U', the programme is a reaffirmation of UOB's long-term\ncommitment to provide its people with meaningful careers and to support them\nin their development journey, the bank [stated in a press\nrelease](https://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/uobgroup/pdf/newsroom/2019/UOB-\nbetteru.pdf).\n\nIt also identifies five core competencies, which form the bases for future\nlearning and employability, that will enable the employees to decide with\ngreater certainty which routes of continued learning and technical\nspecialisation they would like to take.\n\nIn line with that, all UOB employees will undergo a 12-week foundation course\nwith modules targeted at honing these competencies - encouraging a growth\nmindset, developing complex problem-solving skills, as well as acquiring\nskills in the fields of digital innovation, human-centered design and data.\n\nThe course was designed based on behavioural science and training best-\npractices, for instance, with modules designed as games or interactive team-\nbased formats for a more engaging learning experience. Further, almost all the\nmodules are conducted digitally to ensure employees can learn \"at their own\nconvenience.\"\n\nThe Better U programme is the first such training initiative that covers soft\nskills as well as digital and data skills to receive accreditation by the\nInstitute of Banking and Finance Singapore (IBF). Upon completion of the\nfoundation course, employees will be awarded a UOB-IBF Certificate of\nAchievement.\n\nCommenting on this initiative, **Dean Tong, Head of Group Human Resources,\nUOB** , said: \"To help our people find their place in an environment where\nwork is being transformed by technology and customer expectations, we designed\nthe Better U programme to nurture a mindset that is curious and open to new\navenues of personal and professional growth.\n\n\"By designing an holistic development programme that covers both soft and\ntechnical skills, we are sowing the seeds of learning to prepare our people\nfor successful careers in an industry that is undergoing significant change.\"\n\nHe added that the programme is part of the bank's long-term approach to\nnurture its talent and empower them to take control of their future.\n\n\"Through it, we hope our people will be able to discover their full potential\nand for some, possibly chart a new course in their career.\"\n\n**Looking beyond 12 weeks**\n\nMoving forward, once the foundation course has been completed, employees can\nchoose to pursue specialised learning tracks or educational opportunities that\nare aligned with their capabilities and interests.\n\nThey can also apply for financial support to advance their education up to a\nMaster's degree should they meet the bank's selection and sponsorship\ncriteria. Further, the Better U programme suggests learning tracks to guide\nemployees who may not know the area in which they wish to specialise.\n\nApart from that, the bank has introduced two progression pathways in the areas\nof data management and project management, and will expand the range of\nspecialised learning tracks over the next three years.\n\n_Photo /[UOB](https://www.uob.com.sg/)_\n\n[Hong Kong HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-resilience-and-\nwellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\n**27th March** Strengthening the mental resilience and wellbeing of employees\n-  \nimproving employee engagement, talent retention and organisational\nproductivity.  \n[Register now here](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-\nresilience-and-wellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\nBack to Top\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/16104224/65863799_s-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Previous Article:\n\n[Pandora\u8207\u5e1d\u9038\u9152\u5e97\u5c0b\u627e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u8077\u5834\u5b78\u7fd2\u6a21\u5f0f](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/pandora%e8%88%87%e5%b8%9d%e9%80%b8%e9%85%92%e5%ba%97%e5%b0%8b%e6%89%be%e5%ae%8c%e7%be%8e%e8%81%b7%e5%a0%b4%e5%ad%b8%e7%bf%92%e6%a8%a1%e5%bc%8f/)\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/16112256/Aditi-Oct-2019-salary-increases-wtw-\nprovided-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Next Article:\n\n[Salary increases in 2019 and 2020: Asia Pacific\noutlook](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/salary-increases-\nin-2019-and-2020-asia-pacific-outlook/)\n\n# Read More News\n\n04/25/2015 Sat 21:08 PM in All markets by\n[Contributor](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/contributor/ \"Posts\nby Contributor\")\n\n## [How to perform a skills\naudit](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/perform-skills-audit/ \"How to\nperform a skills audit\")\n\nCynthia Stuckey, Asia Pacific MD, The Forum Corporation, lists out how HR\nleaders can take advantage of the SkillsFuture programme..\n\n10/29/2019 Tue 12:12 PM in All markets by [Priya\nSunil](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/priyas/ \"Posts by Priya\nSunil\")\n\n## [Millennials in these industries find their work most\nmeaningful](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/millennials-in-these-\nindustries-find-their-work-most-meaningful/ \"Millennials in these industries\nfind their work most meaningful\")\n\nA recent study found that those whose work involved keeping people healthy or\nsafe, found the most meaning in their roles...\n\n02/04/2013 Mon 15:26 PM in New Zealand by [Sabrina\nZolkifi](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/sabrinaz/ \"Posts by\nSabrina Zolkifi\")\n\n## [Be wary of NZ employment scam](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/wary-\nnz-employment-scam/ \"Be wary of NZ employment scam\")\n\nSingaporeans are paying more than $4,000 to work in New Zealand under a scam\npromising fake employment offers. ..\n\n01/30/2019 Wed 11:15 AM in All markets by [Jerene\nAng](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/jerenea/ \"Posts by Jerene\nAng\")\n\n## [Photos: Singapore Airlines launches digital innovation lab for\nstaff](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/photos-singapore-airlines-\nlaunches-digital-innovation-lab-for-staff/ \"Photos: Singapore Airlines\nlaunches digital innovation lab for staff\")\n\nKrisLab will serve as a collaborative workspace for SIA Group staff to develop\ninnovative ideas and co-innovate with external part..\n\n08/24/2017 Thu 10:32 AM in All markets by\n[Contributor](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/contributor/ \"Posts\nby Contributor\")\n\n## [Money is not enough: The importance of intrinsic\nmotivation](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/money-is-not-enough-the-\nimportance-of-intrinsic-motivation/ \"Money is not enough: The importance of\nintrinsic motivation\")\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all approach to motivation.

in the healthcare industry has the drawback of having to deal with\nirregular and extremely long working hours despite the benefit of a high\nincome. This is especially during times of a new virus or disease such as the\nrecent Wuhan pneumonia outbreak, leaving medical professionals prone to stress\nand burn-out **\u2013** and impacting employee retention in the healthcare sector.\n\nDr Frank Yau, who has more than 10 years of experience working in both private\nand public hospitals, is now the medical director of insurance company Bowtie.\nHere he shares the challenges the medical industry in Hong Kong is facing and\nadvises the possible future direction for human resources.\n\n**What is the biggest HR challenge in the medical industry?**\n\nThe problem of a talent shortage in the medical industry is severe in Hong\nKong, and the reasons mainly falls into two areas. One is in the increasing\ndemand for talents due to medical advancement and medical tourism.\n\nMany critical illnesses are now becoming more treatable, yet the training\nnowadays is highly specialised and more time is required. Growing patient\ndemand from the increasing population and new immigrants , as well as the\nimpact of an ageing population, also contribute to the talent demand.\n\nThe second area is the difficulty in maintaining employee satisfaction in the\nnew generation of medical professionals. Flexible working hours is becoming\nmore popular but its balance with job satisfaction is never easy, especially\nin the highly stressed medical industry.\n\n**What can be done and what are the future recruitment trends in the\nindustry?**\n\nThat would certainly be making changes to enhance employee satisfaction, which\nis lagging behind compared to other industries. This is key to success for\nhealthcare organisations in finding their way to improve the level of care and\npatient satisfaction. Achieving a lower turnover rate, it would be easier to\nbuild a patient-centred care with continuity.\n\nAnother way would be to tackle the fundamental problem in the medical\nindustry, which is the overburdened public healthcare services.\n\nOver the past few years, Hong Kong people have reluctantly suffered from\nlengthy waiting times at public hospitals. According to a recent report\npublished by the Consumer Council, it noted that although 43% of hospitalised\npatients were covered by personal health insurance, they still opted to be\ntreated in public hospitals because they are uncertain about their insurance\npolicy terms and conditions and lack certainty as to whether the exorbitant\nprivate medical costs are eligible for insurance claims. We believe that Hong\nKong people deserve more comprehensive medical protection.\n\n**How could healthcare workers such as nurses, pharmacists and doctors fit\ninto the future landscape of flexible working?**\n\nFlexible work arrangements are starting to take off in many private healthcare\norganisations. It helps to ease pressure during peak demand periods, _e.g._\nduring the influenza season, and makes recruitment and retention of talents\nmuch easier. It would be foreseeable that the working arrangement for doctors,\nnurses and pharmacists will be more responsive to service demand rather than a\nconventional rigid structure.\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

only regional HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\n### Lim Teck Yong, _Shopee 's Head of Regional Operations and People Team,\nspeaks to Priya Sunil on the online marketplace's competency-based, systematic\nand holistic approach towards leadership development for both new and\nexperienced leaders._\n\nWith Southeast Asia becoming the hotspot for many eCommerce and tech ventures,\none of the most pressing challenges for most companies is the talent gap, says\nLim Teck Yong, Head of Regional Operations and People Team at Shopee.\n\nHence, the online shopping platform believes in grooming its leaders from\nwithin. According to Lim, while many of Shopee's young leaders are\n\"exceptional in their own domain\", they are also first-time managers who have\nfaced steep learning curves.\n\nHe says: \"Even for experienced managers who have led teams before, our rapid\ngrowth means that they have had to adapt and manage bigger teams.\"\n\nThe solution? A competency-based, systematic and holistic approach towards\nleadership development, shares Lim. This approach integrates programmes for\nnew and aspiring managers to align on practices of developing high-performing\nteams, as well as tailored programmes for five levels of leadership\nexperience.\n\nAdditional programmes and resources are also available, which include coaching\nand mentoring programmes; organisation-wide feedback tools to identify\nleadership development needs; regular sharing sessions by senior leaders; and\ndedicated in-house leadership trainers and training partners.\n\n\"Our approach necessitates heavy involvement from top management.\"\n\n> ##### Together, with the dedication of our talented professionals within the\n> learning and development team, we are able to build a learning culture.\n\nTo facilitate this culture, the company's Shopee Academy provides foundational\nmodules that introduce first-time leaders to leadership, as well as more\nadvanced modules for experienced leaders.\n\nThe first step into Shopee's learning and development modules takes place\nthrough an intensive regional onboarding programme for managers, where\nexperiential activities highlight the importance of the leadership culture and\ncompetencies. These managers also attend deep-dive sessions to improve their\nunderstanding of Shopee's key business functions. Over 350 leaders have been\ninvolved in this programme since its inception in 2018.\n\nSecond, the academy offers five tiers of leadership development programmes\ndesigned to meet the needs of Shopee's leaders at different stages. Every\nleader in the organisation is invited to participate in the tailored, two-day\ntraining programmes each year.\n\nThe range of programmes include leadership masterclasses (conducted\nexternally); two-hour training courses; brown-bag sessions by senior leaders;\npanel discussions; learning networking sessions; and subsidies for online or\nexternal training.\n\nWithin the first quarter of 2019, more than 450 leaders across the region have\nparticipated in these programmes.\n\nIn addition to the above, Shopee also chose to integrate its current coaching\nprogramme with its leadership programme so as to ensure continuity in its\nstaff learning while emphasising on the application of learning.\n\nLike in every implementation, the team at Shopee has faced some challenges\nalong the way in implementing this gamut of programmes. Lim explains: \"One of\nour challenges in implementing our coaching and mentoring programmes was the\nlimited numbers of coaches and mentors we had, in relation to the number of\nemployees interested in the programmes.\"\n\nIn fact, he admits that the mentoring programme is widely popular, with more\nthan 100 mentors and 300 mentees benefitting from the programme.\n\nTo address this, he shares: \"We learned that senior management support, role-\nmodelling from senior leaders, sharing of success stories, and proper training\nby Shopee's learning and development team, helped to motivate coaches and\nmentors in investing their time and effort.\"\n\n\"Many have commented that they have learnt a lot through the programmes\nthemselves!\"\n\n### Looking towards 2020: What\u2019s on the agenda?\n\nCurrently, Lim believes there is a shortage of talent, especially leaders with\nspecialised tech experience and skills suitable for the eCommerce industry.\n\nFurther, he says: \"Transitioning from tech professionals to leadership\npositions can be rather challenging.\n\n\"Therefore, a formalised, progressive development programme for tech leaders\ncould focus on building critical tech leadership skills, based on the specific\nchallenges faced within tech teams.\"![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/22105026/Screenshot-2019-08-22-at-10.49.17-700x446.png)\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n_This case study was part of a feature on leadership development, which\nappeared in the June-July edition of[Human Resources magazine\n(Singapore)](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/).

A perfect storm of\nrapidly-changing HR technology and a historically-strong job market led to one\nof the most difficult hiring landscapes in a generation in 2019. What\u2019s next\nfor talent acquisition leaders as we enter a new decade in 2020?\n\nUsing company reviews, real-time job listings, salaries, and more from around\nthe world, Glassdoor has curated a list of three HR and recruiting trends\nanticipated for 2020.\n\n### **Trend 1: 2020 will begin a culture-first decade for employers**\n\nIn August 2019, a watershed decision regarding corporate priorities signaled a\nparadigm shift among some of the world\u2019s most influential business leaders\ntoday, including from Apple, Pepsi and Walmart. The [Business\nRoundtable](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/business/business-roundtable-\nceos-corporations.html), a prominent group of nearly 200 CEOs from the world\u2019s\nbiggest brands, declared that shareholders were no longer the chief concern of\ntoday\u2019s companies.\n\nThe new mission statement \u2014 revised for the first time ever \u2014 now states that\n_employees_ are the focus of the modern corporation, along with customers,\nsuppliers, and the broader communities in which companies operate.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of this shift. This formal recognition\nof workplace culture in business today is one that executives can\u2019t afford to\nignore. In 2020, we expect this changing tide of CEO opinion to usher in a new\nwave of culture-first thinking among business leaders, elevating employee\nengagement to the status of core business focus for a growing number of\ncompanies.\n\nThree fundamental trends trends have led to this renewed focus on culture\namong executives:\n\n  * First, **online workplace transparency** has become an accepted norm among job seekers. Candidates are investing more time and energy researching company culture before accepting jobs, creating a dynamic in which employers with strong cultures enjoy a powerful hiring advantage;\n  * Second, jobs in every industry have continued to shift toward **knowledge-based work** \u2014 jobs where workers are highly differentiated, and where the creativity and knowledge of one individual worker can have a huge impact on a business. This shift is happening even in non-tech fields like healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing, making employee culture a non-negotiable core business issue; and\n  * Finally, an expansive collection of research has revealed the real-world business impact of **strong workplace culture**. Workplace culture has been demonstrably linked to better [financial performance](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/satisfied-employees-drive-business-results/), [innovation](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/how-cultural-agreement-affects-business-performance/), [talent attraction](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/studies/why-online-reviews-matter-for-employer-brand-evidence-from-glassdoor/), [ethical workplace behaviour](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/corporate-fraud-linked-to-poor-glassdoor-reviews/), [customer satisfaction](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/studies/employee-customer-satisfaction/) and more. This overwhelming intellectual shift that has changed the minds of CEOs about the deep impact of company culture on businesses. \n\n**What drives culture**\n\nA common misperception is that focusing on employee culture means offering\nexpensive workplace perks like onsite gyms, free meals, and unlimited time\noff. But Glassdoor research shows otherwise: being a culture-first\norganisation isn\u2019t about perks.\n\nIn our five-country\n[study](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/studies/employee-satisfaction-\ndrivers/) of what drives employee satisfaction, we consistently found three\nthings matter most for long-term employee satisfaction on Glassdoor:\n\n  * A workplace with a clear mission connecting employees\u2019 daily work to a broader social purpose and positive change in the world around them;\n  * High-quality senior leaders who are inspiring, empathetic, and competent; and\n  * A set of clearly-defined pathways upward for workers, so that jobs become a journey to the next rung of employees\u2019 career ladder.\n\n> ##### **Companies are doubling down financially on efforts to recruit, hire\n> and retain top talent to deliver on their D &I programmes.**\n\n* * *\n\n### **Trend 2: Employers will further prioritise diversity and inclusion**\n\nIn the last few years, the conversation around workplace diversity and\ninclusion has been fueled by a variety of factors, including the #MeToo\nmovement, expansion of gender pay gap [disclosure](https://gender-pay-\ngap.service.gov.uk/) [policies](https://www.wsj.com/articles/deadline-looms-\nfor-u-s-employers-to-report-pay-for-women-minorities-11566213788) in the UK,\nand rising concern about a lack of diversity in tech and C-suites.\n\nMore companies in 2019 finally got serious about cultivating more diverse and\ninclusive workplaces. In a recent [Glassdoor\nsurvey](https://www.glassdoor.com/about-us/diversity-inclusion-2019/), 64% of\nworkers said their company is investing more in diversity and inclusion than\nin prior years.\n\nIn 2020 and beyond, as companies continue to build action-oriented diversity\nand inclusion teams, we expect to see a wave of hiring for leaders and\nmanagers that will help carry forward the mission of building a more diverse\nand inclusive workforce.\n\nTo do that, companies need expert help to lead these initiatives. As such,\ncompanies are doubling down financially on efforts to recruit, hire and retain\ntop talent to deliver on their D&I programmes.\n\n**What are the types of D &I talent employers need to hire?**\n\nAs of August 2019, the most common D&I roles hiring on Glassdoor included: D&I\nDirector; D&I Programme Manager; D&I Manager; D&I Specialist; D&I Coordinator;\nChief Diversity Officer; Diversity Recruiter; D&I Consultant; Dean of D&I; and\nDiversity Sourcer.\n\n**Big companies lead, for now**\n\nUntil now, most investments in hiring for D&I-related roles have come from\nvery large companies. Our research found that two-thirds of job openings in\ndiversity and inclusion today are at employers with more than 1,000 employees.\n\nThe reason is simple: larger employers are subject to more public and\nregulatory scrutiny, and also have more specialised workforces, allowing them\nto invest in dedicated diversity and inclusion teams.\n\nIn 2020 and beyond, however, we expect more mid-sized employers to begin\nmaking investments in diversity and inclusion teams. This will be fueled by\nthe need to compete for candidates who increasingly seek out companies with\nthese programmes.\n\n* * *\n\n### **Trend 3: Recruiters will adapt as 65+ Baby Boomers become the fastest-\ngrowing workforce**\n\nThe fastest-growing segment of the labour force in the coming decade isn\u2019t\nMillennials or the newest band of Gen Z workers. It\u2019s aging Baby Boomers. This\ndemographic of age 65+ workers are working\n[longer](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/24/baby-boomers-us-\nlabor-force/) than past generations and, estimates show, aren\u2019t going\nanywhere.\n\nThey are healthier, work in physically less-demanding jobs, and are more in\nneed of retirement income than previous generations \u2014 all forces which are\nkeeping older people in the workforce, longer.\n\nHowever, few employers today are well-positioned to make the most of this\n\u201cgray wave\u201d of senior citizens. In 2020 and beyond, we expect to see a\ndramatic shift in recruiting focus, with more strategies aimed at\n[attracting](https://hbr.org/cover-story/2018/11/when-no-one-retires) the\nbooming 65+ workforce and using it to companies\u2019 strategic advantage.\n\nHowever, this historic surge of 65+ workers is also likely to surface new\nchallenges \u2014 most importantly, rising ageism in the workplace \u2014 that employers\nwill be under increasing pressure to combat. Although employers have tackled\nimportant issues of gender identity and ethnic diversity in the workplace, the\nissue of age bias has gotten much less attention \u2014 something we expect to\nchange in 2020 and beyond.\n\nA common myth that fuels ageism in many workplaces is that by delaying\nretirement, older workers may be hurting the career advancement of younger\nworkers, blocking their path to promotion. For example, a recent Associated\nPress [survey](https://workinglongerstudy.org/poll-some-younger-workers-not-\nhappy-with-graying-workforce/) showed that younger workers have a much more\nnegative view than older workers of employees extending their time in the\nworkforce; 50% of older employees viewed seniors working longer as positive\nfor workers, while just 30% of younger workers agreed.\n\nIn reality, research shows that young workers have little to fear from older\nworkers staying in the workforce longer. Using data from 1977 to 2011, a\n[study](https://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Do.older_.workers.squeeze.out_.younger.workers_2.pdf)\nfrom Stanford\u2019s Institute for Economic Policy Research shows no evidence that\nyounger workers\u2019 opportunities were diminished by older workers staying in the\nworkforce longer.\n\nIn particular, the data show that extended senior citizen employment had no\nimpact on youth job opportunities or wages. \u201cIf anything,\u201d the researchers\nsummarised, \u201cthe opposite is true.\u201d That\u2019s an important message for HR teams\nto communicate to younger workers in the coming decade.\n\nAs employers brace for the coming grey wave, we expect to see more HR leaders\nrethinking what the \u201cworker of today\u201d looks like. Talent pools in the coming\ndecade will be more diverse than ever \u2014 not just in terms of gender and\nethnicity, but also age and experience.\n\nEmployers who broaden their definition of inclusivity to welcome older\nworkers, and develop the learning programmes to make the most of the 65+\ntalent pool, will enjoy a strategic hiring advantage in 2020 and beyond.\n\nAll of these developments make 2020 an opportune time for employers to\nposition themselves to benefit from the hiring and job trends presented here \u2014\nand to invest in workplace culture today while the economic times are good.\n\n_Photo /[123RF](https://www.123rf.com/)_\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

a\nNetherlands-based HR Tech company specialised in people analytics and\nworkforce planning. The deal enables the scale-up to accelerate its ambitions\n- Mercer is active in more than 40 countries, while for Mercer, the alliance\nbolsters its data science services to its clients._\n\nCrunchr was founded in 2014 and has since grown to a team of around 20\nprofessionals. The company provides software that analyses human capital data\nand translates insights into strategic information for executives and HR\nleaders. \"Crunchr collects and validates 'people data' to come to important\ninsights. The analyses are presented in multidimensional reports, and a built-\nin function helps users with translating these insights into actions,\"\nexplained Dirk Jonker, founder of Crunchr.\n\nOne of the areas for which Crunchr can be used is finding inconsistencies in\nemployee data. For example, if someone is overpaid for his or her position, a\nsituation that can easily arise in large companies that have operations across\nall parts of the world. \"Insights can be uncovered that can't be seen with the\nnaked eye,\" said Jonker. We can delve into over 40,000 records in seven\nseconds. And leveraging information from outliers, we can re-calibrate the\nalgorithms.\"\n\nAnother are the software supports is strategic workforce planning. For\ncritical positions in a company, such as senior management, HR functions draft\nsuccession plans. These plans lay out which employees could potentially\nreplace a colleague when his/her position becomes vacant. The process to craft\nsuch plans is however challenging - the effort is labour-intensive and plans\nhave a limited shelf life. Crunchr uses the many succession plans in a\ncorporate - large international companies make a few thousand of such plans at\na decentralized level - as input for a workforce planning algorithm. By\nrunning the algorithm when needed, companies are no longer dependent on\noutdated plans, while data can also be updated to reflect the most actual\nsituation.\n\n![Mercer partners with HR Tech firm Crunchr for workforce\nanalytics](/illustrations/news/detail/2019-02-20-165546611-Mercer-partners-\nwith-HR-Tech-firm-Crunchr-for-workforce-analytics-.jpg)\n\nThe approach can also be used for other objectives that form a wider part of\nstrategic workforce planning, including improving the number of women in the\ntop echelons of management, or achieving a better diversity mix across ranks.\n\n## Data's endless opportunities\n\nThe list of how smart data science can benefit human resources is however much\nlonger, said David Sanderse, the CEO of [Mercer](/firms/mercer \"Mercer\") in\nthe Netherlands. \"Using data analysis, organisations can better understand the\nneeds of their employees and which employment conditions they value the most.\nThis enables companies to offer their employees a more distinctive employee\nvalue proposition.\" Against a background of the growing talent crunch and the\nchanging demands of the millennial and Gen Z workforce, building an attractive\nemployee value proposition is increasingly a differentiating factor for\ncompanies, highlighted Sanderse.\n\nBy collaborating with Crunch, Mercer's CEO said that the HR [consulting\nfirm](/firms \"consulting firm\") will enhance its ability to provide clients\nwith a fact-based approach to measuring human capital return on investment.\n\"Allowing for clear HR policies and priorities that can be set.\"\n\nConsultants from Mercer will help clients with adopting and implementing\nCrunchr. Sanderse: \"Organisations believe in the added value of workforce\nanalytics, but are slow with integration. By combining Mercer's workforce data\nwith Crunchr's technology, we can help our clients translate their HR\nobjectives into concrete actions.\"\n\nJonker: \"While there is a clear business case for workforce analytics, we see\nin practice that it requires time and effort to use effectively. Mercer's\nconsultants can help our customers make this integration fast and smooth. We\nare pleased that we have found a strategic partner that can realise this at an\ninternational level.\"\n\nFor Crunchr, the partnership also means that the scale-up will be able to tap\ninto the global network of Mercer, which is expected to provide a range of\ncommercial opportunities. Mercer employs more than 23,000 people across all\nfive continents, and further works closely with sister organisation [Oliver\nWyman](/firms/oliver-wyman \"Oliver Wyman\"), one of the largest strategic\nconsulting firms in the world.\n\nThanks to its head start in its field, Crunchr today belongs to one of the\nfrontrunners in HR data science. The software of the company is entrusted by\nleading names such as AkzoNobel, GrandVision, Naspers, Rabobank, Randstad and\nVolvo. Following a series A financing round which recently closed, the company\nis backed by staffing giant Randstad, insurance company NN Group and HR\nconsultancy firm Focus Orange.\n\n  * [

Want an innovative organisation? Here's how Porsche does it\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\nWhen it comes to innovation, diversity is key, says Anja Hendel, Director of\nInnovation Management and Digital Transformation at Porsche AG.\n\nTo push forward the digital transformation process, Porsche has been operating\nits own innovation laboratory: the Porsche Digital Lab. The lab gathers a team\nof technology and software experts, as well as scientists, and focuses on how\nPorsche can take innovations from upcoming technologies and turn them into\npractical solutions. Since 2017, Hendel has worked alongside Dr. Mahdi\nDerakhshanmanesh to head up the Porsche Digital Lab in Berlin.\n\nAn exclusive media workshop held by Porsche Asia Pacific, in line with\nInnovfest Unbound (27-28 June), gave insight into how the Porsche Digital Lab\nincorporates new technologies - such as artificial intelligence (AI) and\nblockchain - into solutions to help staff do their work more efficiently and\nimprove the security of the cars.\n\nThis include a wearable device that uses sound sensors and AI to help staff\nensure the electronic plug connections in its cars are well connected. Another\ndevelopment is an application that makes use of blockchain to unlock its cars\neven without WiFi connections as well as properly documents when someone\nopened a car and for how long.\n\n### _Human Resources_ spoke to Hendel to uncover the key to creating\ninnovative ideas, as well as how upcoming technological developments can\nchange the way we live and work.\n\n**Q In the Porsche Digital Lab, many interesting things are being developed.\nWhat is a key aspect to creating such innovative ideas?**\n\nIn the end it all comes down to diversity. We try to have real diverse teams\nwhich means from cultural backgrounds, but also educational backgrounds so we\nhave all types of people there. When you have a diverse group of people, it is\nfun because they can learn from each other.\n\nIf we are all the same, it is good because everyone knows what you are talking\nabout. But if you get attacked from the back, no one will see it. With a\ndiverse team, we are all standing in a circle, back to back. While I won't be\nable to see what the person directly behind me is seeing, no one can attack\nus.\n\nWe ensure this by hiring specific people as well as hiring teams and training\nthem to know and value their diversity and work together. No one person can\ncreate innovation by themselves, but a diverse team can do it together because\nthey see things which the others do not see.\n\nAlso, we don't build anything without someone from Porsche in the lab. We call\nthe person a product owner and this is usually the person who knows the\nproblem best. He or she needs to be there because we don't want to just be\ndoing something on our own, we want to work closely with Porsche.\n\n**Q Part of your work involves going around looking at different technologies.\nWhat is the one most innovative thing you've seen so far and how do you think\nit can change the way we work? **\n\nI think they are all innovative and there is so much going on. Among others,\nAI and blockchain.\n\nRight now, AI is not truly AI. We have a specific kind of AI at the moment\nwhich is basically just statistics, it's far from being an AI where a machine\ncan do a lot of things. It is very narrow and rule based. It learns faster and\nmore, and it can work with more data. But, in the end it's pure statistics. If\nwe go to the next level, then let's see how far it gets us. This will an\ninteresting part and it can potentially can offload a lot of work from us with\nautomation.\n\nI also like blockchain. If it comes to its full potential, it can really break\nup the way we organise the world. The platform system can be totally\ndecentralised and it brings a whole new organisational mindset.\n\nTechnology can have a very big impact. But, I think the most important thing\nto remember is that technology is a tool and tools can be used for good and\nalso as a weapon. We have to always keep this in mind and make sure that we\nsolve meaningful problems and not just use technology because it is there. We\nhave to ensure it is always humans first, really have a diverse view on what\ncan be done with technology and try to take responsibility on every use of\ntechnology.\n\n**Q At Innovfest Unbound, you received some pitches about autonomous cars. Do\nyou foresee incorporating that into Porsche?**\n\nThere are many use cases that really makes sense. Every year, 1.2mn people die\nbecause of car accidents and 90% of that happens because of human error -\nbecause the drivers are tired, drunk or not concentrating. I think part of\nautonomous driving can support us to drive better. If you are tired, you can\nswitch it on for a certain time. This is just one part of it.\n\nEven as someone who is not a car girl, having driven in a Porsche on a race\ntrack, I fell in love with it because it is very fun. Imagine if you are\nsitting behind the wheel of a car on a race track and it shows you the perfect\nline, then you take over and try it on your own. These are just some of the\nmany ways to use this.\n\n_Photo / Porsche_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

insights and drive better web performance is an essential way of\nenhancing a company 's online footprint. Consultancy.eu sat down with Anton\nBies, a data analytics consultant at Digital Power, to understand more about\nthe challenges in the space, and how companies can best tackle them._\n\nTracking online performance is important if any company is to stand out among\nthe millions of other websites around. There are a number of tools designed to\nhelp with this, like Google Analytics or Adobe Analytics. However, despite\nthis, consultancy Digital Power finds that in practice the web analytics\nstatistics of businesses are often inaccurate.\n\nDigital Power consists of a team of experts who are passionate about data,\nhelping to enable both small organisations and multinationals to work\neffectively with data. The firm specialises in data analytics, customer\nexperience, data science and data engineering, and is the strategic partner of\nDutch companies in the field of data driven digital\ntransformation.![Challenges in web analytics and tips for\nimplementation](/illustrations/news/detail/2019-10-24-075952257-Challenges-in-\nweb-analytics-and-tips-for-implementation.jpg)Since joining the firm in 2017,\nTechnical Web Analyst Anton Bies has seen first-hand the problems companies\nface when it comes to analysing their data. According to Bies, there are often\nserious issues with the implementation of tools clients use, leading to\nimportant actions on the website not being tracked, or not tracked correctly.\nThey often therefore do not know how their customers use their website,\nsometimes even when they think they know.\n\n\"In our experience,\" Bies explained, \"it is often not the type of site that\ndetermines the quality of their web analytics, but the level of digital\nmaturity of the company. Companies that are more mature are more often focused\non analysing important behaviour on their website with the goal to improve the\ncustomers' experience... With that comes more knowledge of digital analytics\nand therefore the realisation that a useful web analytics implementation\nrequires serious attention. That is why a higher level of digital maturity\nleads to more accurate analytics statistics.\"\n\nThe simplicity of web analytics may strangely be behind the failure of many\nfirms to adequately use them. According to Bies, because it seems so easy to\njust add a \"single line of code\" to a website and have a web analytics tool on\na website, many online teams never learn how to get real value out of the\ntool,\" and fail to invest enough specialised knowledge as a result. Just\nbecause Google Analytics has a lot of standard information it collects, which\ngives a company many data points without any customisation, it does not mean\neverything automatically works the way it is needed to.\n\nOne example Bies pointed to was how a very popular set of reports in Google\nAnalytics relates to traffic sources of visitors. He stated that to ensure\nsessions end up in the right traffic source bucket, firms needed a decent\napproach to campaign tagging, but this was \"rarely done well, even though it\nhas a huge impact on the data.\"\n\n## **Balancing act**\n\nJust how should companies go about balancing accuracy versus usability and\nactual usage, then? Bies suggested that, first and foremost, they should bear\nin mind that they will \"never work with 100% accurate data,\" and build systems\nto compensate for this. Technology limitations, for example, or cross device\nvisitors that do not log in, or even the use of ad blockers can prevent web\nanalytics from being completely accurate.\n\n\"Companies should, first of all, only use web statistics as a way to gain\ninsight in their way of working, not to provide accurate and specific\nnumbers,\" Bies warned. \"And then a company should control what they can\ncontrol as well as possible. And accept what they cannot control as\nunavoidable error rate\u2026 Then, firms must address the need to be successful in\ntranslating analytical data into real action. Many website owners only use a\nfraction of the possibilities they are offered by web analytics data, which is\na missed opportunity.\"\n\n![Digital Power Buildingblocks\n2019](/illustrations/news/detail/2019-10-23-094957622-Digital-Power-\nBuildingblocks-2019.jpg)\n\nWhen asked what companies can do to more effectively gain strategic insights\nthrough web analytics, Bies commented that they should begin by defining a\ncore mission, vision or strategic goal. From that basis, define website Key\nPerformance Indicators (KPIs) and ensure the most important visitor actions\nand KPIs are tracked first.\n\nHe expanded; \"With that fundament available, you can get a first view on how\nthe site is performing and start looking for things that have high improvement\npotential. When you start thinking about how that could be achieved, more\nquestions will come up that will require additional analysis and therefore\nmore advanced analytics tracking.\"\n\n## **Implementing web analytics**\n\nAs with all strategies, however, it is ultimately worthless if it cannot be\nimplemented properly. It is standard procedure for consultants to recommend\nstarting a change project with quick wins - they bring benefits and can be\nreaped relatively easy - and the implementation of a new web analytics regime\nis no different.\n\nOne example Bies pointed to is the potential to perform a quick review lasting\na maximum of two days, which can uncover many issues that can directly be\nfixed, such as broken tracking, or missing tagging on things that are clearly\nimportant to measure. In the end, the biggest wins will come from setting up a\nclear structure. In the context of web analytics, this could mean documenting\nan analytics framework which is used as a foundation for the implementation.\n\n> \"It is often not the type of site that determines the quality of their web\n> analytics, but the level of digital maturity of the company.\"  \n> - Anton Bies, Digital Power\n\n\"Many companies want to do 'really cool data science things' while the basics\nare not in place,\" Bies cautioned. \"In a situation like that, you might end up\nspending a lot of time and money on a product recommendation engine, while the\ncheckout flow is broken on some browsers. Actually, many data science\napplications use web analytics data as input, which means data quality issues\nstrongly influence what can be achieved with data science. Garbage in is\nalways garbage out.\"\n\nOn top of this, he stated it would be wise to implement web analytics step by\nstep. This would mean, when implementing ecommerce tracking, for example,\nfirms should start with the most important part of the implementation - in\nthat case transactions - and work back from there. To help clients put all\nthis into practice Digital Power has developed its Building Blocks Model.\n\n\"To coach clients through the steps required to go from business goals to\nactionable data, while we continuously spend time on accuracy,\" Bies said.\n\"Moving step-by-step, and teaching a company to continuously consider\nactionability of data they collect and analyse, is what really helps them grow\nin digital maturity.\"\n\n  * [ __](mailto:?&subject=Challenges in web analytics and tips for

Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n### _In this exclusive,_ Keith Tan _, Founder of Crown Digital, explains how\nhumans and advanced technology can co-exist, what to focus on when upskilling\nworkers who are displaced by robots, and more._\n\n### Q How feasible is it to establish a landscape where robots and humans co-\nlive and complement each other?\n\nIt's completely feasible to imagine and establish a landscape where humans and\nadvanced technology can co-exist and work together.\n\nFirst and foremost, a healthy ecosystem needs to be created. The ecosystem\nneeds to be created and built with the right amount of foresight, so as to\naccount for and accommodate the inevitable knock-on effects brought about by\nautomation. In essence, a holistic ecosystem needs to be created for such a\nlandscape to work. There can be no short term solutions, or efforts to address\nimmediate changes, because while they may work for awhile, its not going to\nwork in the long term.\n\nExpectations must also be managed by all members within the ecosystem. Not\nevery task is going to be automated. Technology isn\u2019t going to become a magic\nsolution to everything either. Some tasks will not be able to accomplished by\nrobots, things that are service oriented, complex tasks and requests, etc.\n\n### Q What happens to the workers displaced by robots and automation?\n\nIts unavoidable that jobs will be taken over and 'displaced' by robots. But we\nmust also remember that humans are adaptable beings. We\u2019ll always be able to\nfind different tasks to do and areas of specialisation where robots have not\nbeen able to cover yet.\n\nAs cliched as it may sound, this quality of adaptability will be something\nthat humans will always have an edge over robots and technology, no matter how\nsmart technology can get.\n\n### Q Key areas to focus on when upskilling workers who are displaced by\nrobots? (i.e. what are the skills workers need for the future?)\n\nIt will be heavily automated tasks that stand to be automated as technology\nprogresses. Therefore, to stay relevant, workers should try to focus and\nspecialise in areas and roles where empathy is needed. Areas where decision\nmaking is less clear cut will also be unfillable by robots. As such, workers\nshould be working on and brushing up on jobs where the areas of empathy and\ndecision making are indispensable.\n\n### Q What is one pitfall to avoid when implementing such technology?\n\nAs mentioned above, one common pitfall is that people constantly view\ntechnology and automation as a sort of deus ex machina. That\u2019s not the case.\nTechnology is introduced to solve specific problems, rather than 'problems' in\ngeneral.\n\nBusiness owners who are looking to implement technology need to truly\nunderstand what is the problem that they are facing or are trying to solve.\nTechnology should not be implemented for the sake of implementation. Users\nneed to be far-sighted, nimble, and not just think in terms of six months or\none year.\n\nThe worst thing someone can do when implementing technology is to do it just\nfor the gimmicks, and bragging rights of claiming that they\u2019ve implemented\nautomation as part of their business model.\n\n[![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/10123711/Keith-Tan-\nProfile-330x198.jpg)](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/10123711/Keith-Tan-Profile.jpg)\n\n     Keith Tan, Founder of Crown Digital \n\n[![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/10123706/Ella-330x198.png)](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/10123706/Ella.png)\n\n     Ella, Singapore's first robotic barista is a fully automated 6-axis robot, providing customers with consistently high quality coffee at an affordable price. \n\n[![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/10123717/Crown-Coffee-1-330x198.png)](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/10123717/Crown-Coffee-1.png)\n\n     No chance of the barista getting spelling your name wrong on the cup this time \n  \n\n_Photos / Crown Digital_  \n_Lead image /[iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/)_\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

The classic example of **innovation on the fly** was executed by local\nteam members inspired by memes on social media.\n\n  \n\nFounded by **Bhavish Aggarwal** and **Ankit Bhati** , ride-hailing company\nOla, which is now in its eighth year of operation, is clear that one thing\nwill help it clear every roadblock: **igniting the fire of innovation within\nevery employee**.\n\n  \n\n> In an interaction with _YourStory_ , **Srinivas Chunduru, Chief Human\n> Resources Officer (CHRO) at Ola** , says, \"The need for constant development\n> of skill sets is an area of focus with our extensive expansion. We are\n> investing significantly through various first-of-their-kind learning\n> initiatives.\"\n\n  \n\nOla employs more than 7,000 people today, and the majority of them are below\nthe age of 30 years. These employees, the management believes, are \"more\nhungry and passionate to learn\".\n\n  \n\n![Ola\nemployees](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/22035640-2d6d-11e9-aa97-9329348d4c3e/ola-\nemployees21564405000304.png?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)\n\nAn overwhelming majority of Ola employees are below the age of 30 with a\ndesire to learn new things\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/a9efa9c0-2dd9-11e9-adc5-2d913c55075e/Ola_UK_launch1553833622601.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop&blur=500)Also\nRead\n\n### Ola expands services to three new cities in UK, but not with electric\nautos\n\n](https://yourstory.com/2019/03/ola-expanding-three-cities-uk-snm8rx4jbt)\n\n* * *\n\n  \n\nOla introduced two **employee-centric learning programmes, Elevate and Uday**\n, to ensure that their staff keeps evolving. The focused, structured, and\noutput-oriented initiatives aim to **train new joinees and upskill existing\nemployees.**\n\n  \n\n> \"These [programmes] are designed to not only help expand employees' existing\n> skill sets but also to develop a deeper perspective about business. This\n> training will be instrumental in helping them grow as leaders and\n> entrepreneurs,\" Srinivas says. ****\n\n  \n\n## **Diversifying skill sets**\n\n  \n\n **Uday** aims to **drive capability building** through the creation of\nspecialised academies for functions such as finance, HR, business analysis,\nand more. Employees are encouraged to **acquire specialised training** like\nspeaking at public forums, cracking business problems, and attending other\ntraining programmes, **to acquire a deeper understanding and align their\noutput to business goals.**\n\n  \n\nThis initiative includes a fun element: **credits can be earned and redeemed\nfor higher learning programmes,** including a short-term management\ndevelopment programme at an **IIM**.\n\n  \n\nThe training also helps employees gain a **macro view and understanding of the\nbusiness** and the industry. This allows the freedom to take on more\nchallenges from time to time, offering **valuable cross-functional\nexperience**.\n\n  \n\n> Srinivas says, \"As an organisation that runs various businesses, ranging\n> from mobility to financial services and food to fleet management, we are now\n> able to offer our employees **the opportunity to take up new roles across\n> functions** **or business units**.\"\n\n  \n\nOla, which has been built on a foundation of entrepreneurial zeal, is keen to\ninculcate this spirit within the organisation. \" **Being entrepreneurial is a\ncore value and part of our DNA**. That means it also becomes an important\nconsideration during hiring, evaluating performance, and investing in, at all\ntimes,\" Srinivas says.\n\n  \n\n##  **Focusing on freshers**\n\n  \n\nThe company is now eyeing large-scale expansion. On one hand, it is going\nbeyond top metros and **entering Tier II and III locations in India** , and,\non the other, it has made **an international foray** by venturing into\n**Australia, New Zealand** , and the **United Kingdom**.\n\n  \n\nGiven the differing dynamics of the two markets, the ride-hailing firm startup\nneeds to constantly reskill existing employees and provide the right training\nto new joinees. (Ola is very focussed on campus hires who inducted from\nvarious engineering and business schools).\n\n  \n\nThe Elevate programme, **focused on freshers** which is spread across 12\nmonths, is designed to make **a smooth transition from academic life to the\nworkplace**. It includes **interaction with the leadership** of various\nbusiness verticals, **visiting different cities** to understand local business\ncommitments and goals, and spending time on-boarding driver partners, and at\ncall centres, dark kitchens, etc. Activities such as **product days and\nhackathons** are also part of this experience.\n\n  \n\n> \"The goal is to impart **hands-on experience and deeper insight** into\n> various business verticals, procedures, and objectives,\" Srinivas says. \"At\n> Ola, **fresh campus hires are often involved in crucial projects** that\n> enable them to inculcate an appetite for risk at an early stage of their\n> career. These also allow a senior experienced leader to pivot to a new role\n> altogether,\" he adds.\n\n  \n\nAs a technology startup, Ola knows that it is evolving faster than ever and\nneeds employees to invest in themselves. \"Through various initiatives like\nmonetary allowances for learning and periodicals, we also encourage employees\nto invest in themselves,\" Srinivas says.\n\n  \n\n![Ola\nemployees](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/22035640-2d6d-11e9-aa97-9329348d4c3e/Ola-\nemployees11564405334035.png?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)\n\nParticipants in Ola's employee engagement programme - Elevate\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/a182c7e0-1407-11e9-87e2-f7248b252f46/Bhavish_Sachin1550671158833.png?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop&blur=500)Also\nRead\n\n### Exclusive: Sachin Bansal and Bhavish Aggarwal talk about the biggest\ndomestic investment in a d...\n\n](https://yourstory.com/2019/02/exclusive-sachin-bansal-bhavish-aggarwal-ola-\nfunding)\n\n* * *\n\n  \n\nTo recognise intrapreneurs, Ola has instituted a first-of-its-kind **Founders\nAward for entrepreneurial employees**. This grant of ESOPs and Rs 20 lakh can\ngo towards a social cause or initiative they relate to. Additionally, Ola\noffers monthly, quarterly, and annual recognition awards (by peers) in various\ncategories to employees.\n\n  \n\nUday and Elevate have started showing **tangible business outcomes for Ola\nwhen employees are part of these programmes**. \"Their understanding of\nbusiness and challenges helps them build solutions that are sharper,\" Srinivas\nsays.\n\n  \n\nAs Ola goes about achieving new milestones, its culture remains old: every\nemployee, irrespective of their designation or time spent in the company, is\nstrongly encouraged to **share ideas, suggestions, and solutions**.\n\n  \n\nOne of its most popular products, **Ola Auto** , is an example. The auto\nrickshaw service was \"suggested\" by an intern.\n\n  \n\n> \"From a path-breaking innovation, this has now evolved into **a key business\n> unit and a significant revenue stream for Ola**. It has a very deep social\n> impact and a mobility use case that millions of customers love,\" Srinivas\n> says.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n ** _(Edited by Teja Lele Desai)_**\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/wordpress/2018/09/Employee-\nHappiness.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop&blur=500)\nAlso Read\n\n### Why employee happiness is the key to success - and how to achieve it\n\n](https://yourstory.com/2018/09/employee-happiness-key-to-success)\n\n **How has the coronavirus outbreak disrupted your life?

Masterclass\nSeries](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-resilience-and-\nwellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\n**27th

Singapore may tighten their salary budgets this year, only\npossibly offering new hires a 5% to 10% salary increment.\n\nAt the same time, despite a more optimistic labour outlook for Asian markets\nas compared to the European and American markets, **candidates in Singapore\nare expected to have a much lower risk appetite** this year.\n\nAccording to [Randstad's 2020 Market Outlook -\nSingapore](https://www.randstad.com.sg/workforce-insights/workforce-\ntrends/singapore-labour-market-outlook-2020/?utm_medium=post-non-\npaid&utm_source=content&utm_campaign=2020-outlook-), while employees are still\ninterested in factors such as growth opportunities and better compensation\npackages, they are likely to be more concerned about job security and an\norganisation's financial stability, given current economic uncertainties.\n\nApart from the above, any **hiring of replacement headcount due to attrition\nis likely to slow down** this year, with certain roles and functions being\nabsorbed into existing teams. This would help keep manpower costs low, while\ndriving higher efficiencies.\n\nThat said, **companies will reserve any large-scale investments for critical\nroles and digital transformation initiatives** , particularly for projects\nthat can account for immediate costs savings and revenue generation.\n\nOverall, the report presented the most in-demand skills and job roles across\nthree major industries - fintech, manufacturing & supply chain, and FMCG &\nretail.\n\n## **Most in-demand skills and job roles in fintech**\n\nIn 2020, mid-level professionals in banking are more likely to switch over to\nfintech, especially those who do not see any lateral opportunities or career\ngrowth in the next 12 months.\n\nWhen hiring such talent, fintech firms are seen to prefer those with **at\nleast five years of working experience** , as they would have a deeper\nunderstanding of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)'s regulations and\nfail-proof workflows, which can help firms drive commercial expansion.\n\nMore importantly, with rising competition in the areas of payments, deposits,\ninvestments, e-wallets and SME lending, **fintech firms will increasingly look\nfor talent in product sales and relationship management**. As firms expand\ntheir operations to other ASEAN markets, **candidates who** **have experience\nworking in a regional remit will be highly sought-after**.\n\nGiven the above, there is still a lack of talent with the skills to work in an\nindustry such as fintech - and as such, firms are now assessing talent more on\ntheir transferable skills and culture fit, instead of focusing solely on past\nworking experience.\n\nFurther down the journey, fintech firms are encouraged to meet this shortfall\nof skills and high talent demand with a solid onboarding plan, and training &\ndevelopment programmes to help their new hires better integrate into the new\nenvironment.\n\n**[ALSO READ:[Top 20 most attractive employers in Singapore: Exclusive\nranking](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/top-20-most-attractive-\nemployers-in-singapore-exclusive-ranking/)]**\n\n### **A more \"progressive\" approach to compensation packages in fintechs**\n\nFintechs are gradually moving away from the traditional method of remuneration\n- which is typically a pay hike that is calculated based on a percentage from\ntheir last drawn salary. Instead, they are taking on a more progressive\napproach when designing their compensation packages, the report found.\n\nFor instance, larger and more established players are able to offer benefits\nthat match market standards, while start-ups, on the other hand, might take a\nmore radical approach - by offering unlimited leave, for example.\n\nThis, however, does not mean a less competitive pay package in the industry.\nEmployers are still willing to pay the perceived value they feel the tech\ncandidate can bring to the company.\n\nOn the banking and financial services front, there is still a traditional take\non salaries. While it is highly dependent on the responsibilities of the role,\nthe **salary increase usually ranges between 10% and 20%** - consistent with\nwhat banks are offering. This would typically be split between the commission\nand base salary for revenue-generating roles.\n\nSome senior-level professionals may also receive equity as part of their\nremuneration packages, especially if they are highly pursued by young start-\nups.\n\n## Most in-demand skills and job roles in manufacturing & supply chain\n\nAs a result of a relatively muted supply and demand market observed in 2019,\ncompanies are likely to be risk-averse in 2020.\n\nFollowing this, hiring activities have slowed down in 2019, and is expected to\ncontinue through to the end of 2020 if the market does not pick up. Further,\n**there will be fewer newly-created roles within the industry** , with\ncompanies only hiring for replacement or contract roles, instead of new\nheadcounts.\n\nIn line with this, **companies are likely to place more focus on R &D** this\nyear, either to enhance their existing products or create new developments in\nthe next year. Industries which will see more R&D attention are medical and\naerospace, while it will remain low in semiconductor and electronic\nmanufacturing.\n\nLooking at roles - those that will be in **high demand this year will be\nmainly manufacturing engineers and process development engineers** within the\nR&D departments. These roles require talent to have relevant experience in\nsimilar background and specialised skills, as they are usually the ones\ndriving innovation in the company.\n\nSimilar to the fintech industry, the manufacturing & supply chain also faces a\nlack of skilled talent, with a widening skills gap. To address this, companies\nin Singapore are increasingly looking to technology and advanced\nmanufacturing, and to prepare themselves for expansion when the market picks\nup. As such, companies should be creating new jobs in the digital economy,\nwith a talent pool equipped with experience in these disciplines.\n\nWith that, as part of Industry 4.0, **roles related to next-generation\nmanufacturing and involving 5G, data collection and analytics, machine\nlearning and artificial intelligence will be created** - likely improving the\nquality of the labour pool.\n\n**Salary expectations of job candidates in manufacturing & supply chain**\n\nAn organisation's financial remuneration package has been highlighted as [a\nkey factor in a candidate's job\nconsideration](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/top-20-most-attractive-\nemployers-in-singapore-exclusive-ranking/), and this includes the base salary,\nincentives, allowances, and employee benefits. In 2020, employees who are\nswitching companies can expect an average salary increase of between 5% to\n10%.\n\n## Most in-demand skills and job roles in FMCG & retail\n\nAccording to the report, firms in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG)\nservice are actively trying to build an internal talent pipeline that consists\nof professionals who are skilled in both new digital media and traditional\nmarketing.\n\nIn fact, as consumers' behaviours and purchasing patterns constantly evolve,\nsales and marketing professionals need to be able to accurately anticipate\nupcoming market trends and build sales strategies and workflows around them.\nAs a result, many **employers are increasingly particular about who they\nhire**.\n\nIn light of that, **job applicants can expect the interview process to be\nslightly longer in 2020** , as employers may want candidates to meet with more\npeople from the company before they make a decision. **Companies also tend to\nhire professionals for the role that the employers want to groom them into**.\nFor example, when a company opens a job position for a brand manager today,\nthey are actually looking for someone who they can promote to become a brand\nmarketing director in the next few years.\n\nAdditionally, candidates who demonstrate learning potential and professional\nmaturity, as well as **strong leadership qualities such as people management\nand effective communication skills** , will be highly sought-after.\n\n**Employees ' salary and job-switch expectations**\n\nAs compared to other sectors, the **tendency of employees to change employers\nin 2020 is not as high in the FMCG space** , with many holding back on\nchanging jobs. Instead, there will be a higher focus on job security until the\nmarket recovers.\n\nOn the job search front, candidates will more likely apply to employers that\nare seen to have a more promising product pipeline or stable sales teams.\n\nWhen changing employers, **candidates can expect an average 15% salary\nincrease in 2020**.\n\n_Photo /[iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/sg)_\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

Sparkstudio/Shutterstock\n\n**Analysts have discovered \u201ca powerful link between a business\u2019s performance\nand the extent to which its HR and finance leaders collaborate\u201d. This HR-\nfinance partnership is hugely valuable to organisations if only they can get\nit right. But new research has revealed that collaboration is proving\ndifficult to instigate and challenging to navigate, writes Concentra Analytics\n' Rupert Morrison.**\n\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising that HR and finance aren\u2019t exactly clicking. These\ndepartments have never been closely aligned, so why the necessity for\ncollaboration now? In short, so what?\n\nThere\u2019s one crucial reason: business performance.\n\nHR is beginning to realise the potential of people data and workforce\nanalytics. And as it becomes even more mainstream a healthy relationship with\nfinance will mean both teams can be more effective and deliver true\norganisational value.\n\n### HR metrics 2019\n\n**[Which HR metrics will matter in\n2019?](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/which-hr-metrics-will-matter-\nin-2019/)**\n\n**[Labour turnover (voluntary resignation rate)](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/hr-\nbenchmarking/question/221470/.aspx?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n**[Absence rate](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/hr-\nbenchmarking/question/219244/.aspx?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n**[Number of employees per HR staff member](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/hr-\nbenchmarking/question/217739/.aspx?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\nSo, what are the challenges holding back better cooperation? And what can be\ndone about it? We commissioned research with over 400 HR and finance decision-\nmakers to find out.\n\n## Where are we now?\n\nFor HR and finance to collaborate effectively there needs to be recognition of\nthe issue, a willingness to change, and effective processes in place to\nsupport it. So how close are we to achieving that?\n\nThe research shows that less than half (40%) of HR and finance decision-makers\nin the UK and US believe they have a collaborative relationship. The results\nalso revealed a difference in how each side views the relationship. Of HR\nrespondents, 45% believe there\u2019s good collaboration between departments, but\nonly one in four (25%) finance decision-makers agreed with them.\n\nWith low collaboration scores from both sides, we asked about the barriers to\nsuccess and the challenges were clear.\n\nHR reported a lack of confidence when it comes to working with people data. In\nfact, 62% admitted that acquiring the right skills was the single biggest\nbarrier to better people analytics and the most difficult to overcome. And the\ndata showed that there was not enough insight into people data and that shared\nreporting structures were virtually non-existent; only 28% of respondents said\nthey had common reporting systems.\n\nSo, what are the few problems standing in the way of collaboration around\npeople planning and analytics?\n\nFirstly, and somewhat ironically for HR, there\u2019s clear confusion around roles\nand responsibilities.\n\nOur survey found that HR and finance are split on who should take the lead on\nstrategic workforce planning. HR decision-makers feel strongly they should own\nit (76%), while more than half of finance respondents (55%) say they should be\nin charge. Meanwhile, 88% of finance leaders believe they should control\nworkforce costs, while 63% of HR respondents say their department should take\nthe lead.\n\nSecondly, technology is holding back progress with the majority (55%) of\nrespondents believing that their current technology stands in the way.\n\nJust 10% have extensively adopted specialised workforce analytics software.\nWhile others are testing or piloting such solutions, or using them just in\nsome areas, many continue to rely on spreadsheets (48%) or PowerPoint (41%)\nfor activity analysis and organisation planning. And only 21% of HR\nprofessionals report being comfortable with data-modelling tools.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s a distinct lack of insight and forward-planning capabilities;\nsomething recognised as important by both finance and HR. Predictive analytics\nis starting to become central to discussions about people, but more work needs\nto be done to improve data literacy so that it is interpreted accurately and\nused to support strategic workforce planning. The vast majority (92%) of those\nsurveyed agreed that HR should have a forward-looking capability for\norganisational planning.\n\n## Creating a shared mindset\n\nA [2018 CIPD study](https://www.cipd.co.uk/Images/people-analytics-\nreport_tcm18-43755.pdf) noted that updating technology alone is not enough:\n\u201cWhile technology suites offer the opportunity to bring people analytics (and\nevidence) to more HR professionals, in reality the receiving system (the\norganisation, the function and the team) for the technology must be both\nprepared and willing to adopt new practice.\u201d For this to happen, HR needs to\nembrace a more analytical mindset.\n\nOur survey highlights the need for HR to add planning capabilities that are\nmore data-driven and forward-thinking. Here, HR directors can take inspiration\nfrom finance. While much of finance\u2019s responsibility, like HR\u2019s, lies with\nday-to-day matters, the finance department also has specialists who focus on\nlonger-term financial planning and analysis (FP&A). It\u2019s in their DNA.\n\nAs analyst Conner Forrest, who works for US-based 451 Research, notes:\n\u201cExecutives and managers must think more strategically about their workforce\nas a framework for driving innovation and improving the bottom line.\u201d\n\n## HR Director opportunities on Personnel Today\n\n  \n[**Browse more HR director jobs**](https://jobs.personneltoday.com/jobs/hr-\ndirector/)\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is to elevate organisational planning and analysis (OP&A) to the\nsame level as FP&A in the organisational lexicon. With its own title and\nworking group that includes HR and finance, both can build a better\nrelationship around shared goals.\n\n## Breaking barriers and building bridges\n\nPlanning for an organisation\u2019s future involves asking many questions: how\nshould the business be designed to deliver on strategy? Are people doing the\nwork they should be doing? What skills do we need now and in the years to\ncome? How are employee costs likely to change in order to meet our goals?\n\nTo answer those questions, HR and finance need to break out of their\nindividual silos. And it\u2019s not just about getting them to talk more, it\u2019s a\nwholesale change in the way the two functions communicate, collaborate and\nplan.\n\nIf an engaged, agile and productive workforce is the goal, then OP&A is the\nplaybook. OP&A is a natural partner for established FP&A functions. It creates\na common language and clear data points enabling finance and HR to have a\nmeaningful, fact-based, dialogue about how they can meet collective\nobjectives.\n\nBut someone needs to take the first step.\n\n![Rupert Morrison](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/05/Rupert-again-1.jpg)\n\n#### About Rupert Morrison\n\nRupert is the CEO and co-founder of

Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\nUnited Overseas Bank (Malaysia) (UOB Malaysia) has launched a holistic\nlearning and development programme, to help its more than 3,000 employees\nbuild successful careers in the digital age. The programme, titled 'Better U',\nwas [first launched in Singapore in October\n2019](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/uob-launches-better-u-ld-programme-\nto-hone-employees-future-ready-skills/).\n\nIn a [press release](https://www.uob.com.my/about/news/2020/press-release-\nmar02-2020.page), the bank called this programme a reaffirmation of its long-\nterm commitment to provide employees with meaningful careers and to support\nthem in their development journey.\n\nIt is also part of the bank's long-term approach to nurturing talent and to\nempowering its people through learning and development, **Lai Tak Ming,\nExecutive Director and Country Head of Human Resources, UOB Malaysia** ,\nadded.\n\n\"New technologies will continue to impact the way in which banking solutions\nare designed, developed and delivered. As such, we want to prepare our people\nnot only for the industry's needs today but for the future as well. Through\nthe Better U holistic development programme, our people will be equipped with\nboth the skills needed to navigate the future demands of work and be empowered\nto build successful, long-term careers.\"\n\n### **A programme that hones a growth mindset, complex problem-solving skills,\nand more**\n\nUOB's Better U programme is a training initiative that covers soft skills as\nwell as digital and data skills. Through a 12-week foundation course, all UOB\nMalaysia employees will complete modules aimed at honing five core\ncompetencies - a growth mindset, complex problem-solving skills, and skills in\nthe fields of digital innovation, human-centred design, and data story-\ntelling.\n\nThese five core competencies, which form the bases for future learning and\nemployability, will enable employees to decide with greater certainty which\nroutes of continued learning and technical specialisation they would like to\ntake.\n\nTo cultivate a habit of continual learning among its employees, the 12-week\ncourse is designed using behavioural science insights and training best\npractices. For example, many modules have been designed as games or\ninteractive team-based formats for a more engaging learning experience. Almost\nall the modules are digital so that employees can embark on their learning\njourneys at their own convenience.\n\nThe programme is accredited by the Institute of Banking and Finance Singapore\n(IBF), an industry association that fosters and develops the professional\ncompetencies of the financial industry. UOB Malaysia employees will be awarded\na UOB-IBF Certificate of Achievement upon completion of the foundation course,\nand will be able to pursue specialised learning tracks or educational\nopportunities that align with their capabilities and interests.\n\nEmployees will also be able to apply for sponsorship from the bank to advance\ntheir education up to a Master's degree.\n\nFor employees who may be unsure of which area to specialise in, they can opt\nfor one of two progression pathways - in the areas of data management, and\nproject management; the bank will continue to expand the range of specialised\nlearning tracks over the next three years.\n\n_Photo /[123RF](https://www.123rf.com/)_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

[Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\nThis article is brought to you by [Infocomm Media Development Authority\n(IMDA)](https://www2.imda.gov.sg/).\n\n### _With IMDA predicting a projected demand of over 28,500 infocomm\nprofessionals from 2018 to 2020, let\u2019s find out how[the TechSkills Accelerator\n(TeSA)](https://www.imda.gov.sg/imtalent/about-us/National-Talent-Development-\nInitiatives/techskills-accelerator--tesa) presents a range of opportunities\nfor employers like Aviva to address this demand._\n\nBack in 2017, **Anuradha Purbey, Aviva\u2019s People Director, South East Asia** ,\nand her leadership team were seeking ways to future-proof Aviva\u2019s employees.\n\nThe team started out by prioritising the development of key change-enabling\ncompetencies that the business needed most, and identified one key technology\n\u2015 cloud \u2015 as a core pillar of its strategy. Purbey adds: \u201cCultivating digital\n\u2015 specifically cloud-ready talent was made our top priority.\u201d\n\nWith the inevitable transformation brought about by digitalisation, they knew\nthey would need a programme that would not only enable employees to take on\nhigher-value work, but also find greater meaning in their roles. This, in\nturn, would help employees thrive in the digital age, and allow the company to\nretain its talent and strengthen its internal capability.\n\nThis vision was strengthened by the fact that skills training has become more\nthan a buzzword \u2015 [a 2018 survey](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/what-\nceos-need-to-do-attract-and-retain-tech-talent/), commissioned by Weber\nShandwick in partnership with KRC Research, revealed job skills/training as\namongst the top three issues employees in both non-tech sectors (70%) and tech\nsectors (80%) would want their CEOs to address.\n\nThrough multiple conversations on the various initiatives available, the team\ndecided the most relevant choice would be the Infocomm Media Development\nAuthority (IMDA)\u2019s [TechSkills Accelerator\n(TeSA)](http://www.imtalent.sg/tesa) initiative.\n\n### Developing a future-ready ICT workforce\n\nTeSA is a tripartite initiative by the government, industry and the National\nTrades Union Congress, to develop a skilled ICT workforce for Singapore, and\nto enhance employability for individuals.\n\n[Launched in 2016](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/insights-from-\nparliament-singapores-plan-to-develop-digital-ready-talent/) and driven by\nIMDA, TeSA comprises three priority thrusts. First, there is the Skills\nFramework for ICT which can be used by hirers to develop career maps and\narticulate job requirements.\n\nThe second is a broad-based as well as targeted approach to skills acquisition\nand validation, with programmes such as Company-Led Training (CLT) and Tech\nImmersion and Placement Programme (TIPP).\n\nThe third is a holistic career support ecosystem inclusive of job matching,\ngroup mentoring and leadership programmes, aimed at enhancing the chances of\nemployability of individuals.\n\nAs such, Aviva opted for a targeted approach that gave them the confidence to\nmeet the challenges brought on by digitalisation through a 12-month,\nstructured CLT programme to develop new cloud capabilities.\n\nEligible Aviva employees went through a combination of on-the-job training,\njob rotations, as well as in-depth training, conducted both internally and\nexternally. Purbey adds: \u201cStriking a balance between actual work and learning\ncan be tricky. The CLT programme enables Aviva to adopt a co-learning model to\nbuild cloud capabilities.\n\n\"For example, it frees up our current employees' capacity by recruiting new\nhires fresh from academia. In turn, new hires are paired to a mentor which\nfacilitates mutual exchange of ideas.\"\n\nPurbey knew she had made the right decision in upskilling her workforce. She\nexplains: \u201cAfter undergoing the programme, our employees are equipped with\ntechnical cloud expertise to drive our organisational strategy and growth. We\nalso observed cross-generational learning taking place between our current\nemployees and new hires.\u201d\n\n**Enterprise Architect Lee Ann** , an employee who has undergone the\nprogramme, affirms the training has also brought her new insights in two key\nareas. \"Firstly, network and infrastructure, where it no longer means the hard\nwiring and data centres, but instead can be switched on or off easily as a\nservice (Infrastructure as a Service, or IaaS).\n\n\"Secondly, automated deployment, whereby with better means of automating IT\noperational tasks, we have to consider up-front what the end-users want, how\nIT security controls can be embedded and automated, shortening deployment\nprocesses to roll out new functionalities to customers more quickly.\"\n\nAviva has partnered with IMDA under TeSA\u2019s CLT programme to train 60 employees\nin cloud capabilities over the next three years. With the company having\nembarked on its second cohort, this will bring the number of employees trained\nto close to 40.\n\nSince TeSA\u2019s launch, more than 81,000 training places have been taken up or\ncommitted.\n\n### Offering a selection of opportunities\n\nApart from the CLT, employers can also benefit from the TIPP programme, which\naims to convert non-ICT professionals into industry-ready ICT professionals\nthrough intensive, immersive courses. Interested employers can also become a\nTIPP partner and take in trainees at their company.\n\nEmployers can also upskill their existing workforce with the Critical Infocomm\nTechnology Resource Programme Plus (CITREP+), which focuses on building\nspecialised ICT skillsets through courses and certifications in areas such as\ncybersecurity, blockchain, digital leadership, and more.\n\n### Keeping pace with changing times\n\nWith such options available, organisations such as Aviva can tap on a wide\nrange of programmes that fit their needs. At the same time, individuals are\nalso given the opportunity to upskill and reskill to be ready for Industry\n4.0.\n\nIn fact, as shared by Singapore\u2019s Minister for Communications and Information\nS Iswaran [in a speech](https://www.mci.gov.sg/pressroom/news-and-\nstories/pressroom/2019/7/opening-address-by-mr-s-iswaran-at-the-singapore-\ncomputing-society-tech3-forum-on-19-july-2019) earlier this year: \"Companies\nhave a key role to play in developing talent that not only adds value to their\norganisation but also uplifts the larger ICT community.\"\n\nThus, through TeSA, employers either looking to get support in developing\ntheir employees\u2019 tech skills, or to keep up with ICT talent development would\nbe able to seize the exciting opportunities ahead.\n\nPurbey concludes: \"I believe that growth begets growth. It not only\naccelerates our digital progress as an industry but deepening digital\ncapabilities across the board also enhances the sector\u2019s appeal, attracting\neven more promising digital talents.\"\n\n_For more information on TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA) and its programmes (and\nhow it can add value to your organisation),\nvisit[www.imtalent.sg/TeSA](http://www.imtalent.sg/TeSA)._\n\n_Photo / provided_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

alone, this FMCG major has a diverse talent pool of 800\nemployees representing 10 nationalities. Take a bite out of the secrets shared\nby Charlene Phang, Human Resources Lead, Mondel\u0113z International (Malaysia), in\nthis conversation with Jerene Ang._\n\nSome of the world\u2019s most loved snack brands such as Cadbury, Twisties, Oreo,\nand others are managed by snacking powerhouse, Mondel\u0113z International. To\nreinforce and build upon this image, the company has embarked on the 'snacking\nmade right campaign' by empowering consumers to snack right, with the right\nsnack, at right moment, and made the right way.\n\nIn the midst of this change journey, Charlene Phang, Human Resources Lead,\nMondel\u0113z International (Malaysia), shares how the organisation is shifting\ntowards a winning growth mindset and successfully attracting and retaining\nMillennials and women leaders.\n\n### Q How does HR play an important role in supporting the purpose of\n'snacking made right'?\n\n'Snacking made right' is our promise to place consumers at the focal point of\nour initiatives, by offering the right snack, for the right moment, made the\nright way.\n\nOur key strategy to achieve this philosophy is to build a winning growth\nculture internally by investing in the development of key growth skills and\ncapabilities that allow our teams to succeed in what they do, make quick\ndecisions, and be agile in responding to market conditions.\n\n### Q What does a winning growth culture look like, when it flows down the\nhierarchy to the various levels?\n\nWinning growth culture is about each employee having a growth mindset, feeling\nempowered and being agile. To achieve this, we have developed a leadership\nframework focusing on three values: love our consumers & brands, grow every\nday, and do what\u2019s right. Each value has corresponding commitments and\nbehaviours needed to support this culture, which in turn helps us lead the\nfuture of snacking and sets us apart from our competition.\n\n### Q How does this culture contribute towards creating future talent within\nMondel\u0113z?\n\nWe believe our purpose and culture resonates strongly with talents and\ncontributes to our success in many ways. Under one of our key values of \u2018grow\nevery day\u2019, we have a number of initiatives to support talent development,\nencourage performance and enhance careers.\n\nWe are committed to growing our people by investing and developing their\ncapabilities and ensuring each person has the right skills to thrive, even in\nthe most challenging environment. Through the use of the 70-20-10 learning\nprinciple, we help employees achieve their progression goals by providing\nopportunities, coaching and structured assistance.\n\nOn top of that, we are also committed towards helping the next generation\nbuild a fulfilling career with us. We are firm believers in creating an\nenvironment where our colleagues are able to achieve greater things through\ncollaborative working, bold actions and individual ownership.\n\nWe believe in having fun at work, by celebrating everyday joys and\nachievements with each other.\n\n> ##### As an organisation, we have a Diversity & Inclusion Committee that is\n> sponsored by the global leadership team which is actively promoting this\n> agenda.\n\n### Q What is your strategy for attracting Millennials and grooming them to be\nfuture leaders?\n\nWe have been particularly successful in attracting Millennials and nurturing\nthem to be future leaders by empowering them to take control of their\nexperience.\n\nThrough our employer branding proposition, \u2018Make it\u2019, we emphasise on the\nquality of experience at Mondelez and bring this to life in different ways\nfrom \u2018Make it with pride\u2019, \u2018Make it possible\u2019 to \u2018Make it matter\u2019 and \u2018Make it\nuniquely yours\u2019.\n\nTo be effective in communicating this to the talent across all generations and\ncareer stages, we engage with them where they are spending most of their time,\nlearning about employers, and consuming content.\n\nFurthermore, we have specialised programmes, like our Graduate Trainee\nProgramme, that are tailored towards helping young graduates accelerate their\nlearning and progression in the FMCG industry.\n\n### Q How does the company celebrate diversity and give equal opportunity to\nits people?\n\nWe place great emphasis on diversity and inclusion and are committed to\ncreating a level playing field where everyone can grow and be at their best.\nIn Malaysia alone, we have a fairly diverse pool of employees consisting of\n800 employees representing 10 nationalities.\n\nAs an organisation, we have a Diversity & Inclusion Committee that is\nsponsored by the global leadership team which is actively promoting this\nagenda.\n\nOver the last few years, we have introduced several policy changes that allows\nfor greater flexibility, including flexible working arrangement, working from\nhome, and extended parental leave (primary care giver and secondary care\ngiver).\n\nThese initiatives have supported our organisation dynamic that comprises about\n50% of female employees, regional roles supporting different time zones, and\nmulti-generation employees.\n\nAdditionally, we enjoy great success in gender equality, with up to 45% of our\nfemale employees holding leadership positions.\n\n### Q We understand that women make up 45% of the leadership positions; can\nyou explain how Mondel\u0113z has been able to achieve this?\n\nGender equality is really important to us. To achieve this, we introduced\nseveral initiatives to professionals that offer greater flexibility, such as a\nrevised parental leave to 90 days (30 days more than the government standard\nof 60 days), with an additional 90 days of \u2018work from home\u2019 (WFH) option for\nnew mothers after the maternity leave ends.\n\nEmployees who choose to work from home may also define their own set of\nworking hours if needed, as we have technology that allows team members to\nstay connected regardless of location.\n\nThis helped us improve retention, job satisfaction, productivity, and\nengagement by helping women employees to balance work and family commitments.\n\n_Photo / Provided_\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

skills continue to grow in\nimportance'](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/038/0223_637153100753821198.jpg)\n\nBY [John Hilton](/nz/authors/john-hilton) 23 Jan 2020\n\nShare\n\nWe're seeing vacancy activity across many sectors for skilled professionals,\nincluding finance, IT, marketing, HR, construction, office support and\ninsurance, according to Adam Shapley, Managing Director of Hays in New\nZealand.\n\n\"But there are wider macro issues at play that will dictate the success of a\njobseeker this year,\" he added.\n\nIndeed, DevOps Engineers, Analytics Managers and Revit Technicians make the\nlist of the top skill shortfalls for the first half of 2020, according to\nHays.\n\nHowever, Hays warns jobseekers that technical skills aren't all that employers\nexpect in job applicants this year.\n\nThe latest Hays Jobs Report, covering the January to June 2020 half, includes\nthe skills that are in greatest demand in 14 sectors and industries across New\nZealand.\n\nThe Report, which is updated twice a year to reflect changing market\nconditions, also earmarks Civil Engineers, HR Business Partners, Project\nCoordinators and Plumbers as core areas of demand until June 2020.\n\nThe key trends are for skilled professionals who, regardless of their role or\nindustry, possess strong interpersonal and creative skills.\n\nEmployers also want people who can make data-based decisions, adapt well to\nchange and are continuous learners.\n\n### Most

Treading uncharted territory: Tools for today's L&D practitioners\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/). Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\n### _\u201cToto, I\u2019ve a feeling we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore,\u201d gasped Dorothy in the\niconic movie, The Wizard of Oz. The same is true for HR and L &D experts who,\nfaced with an ever-changing business terrain, are unearthing new ways to\nengage, reskill and upskill employees. Aditi Sharma Kalra reports._\n\nBack in the day, most organisations had a dedicated training executive whose\njob was to pull data from the training needs analysis, input it into an annual\ntraining calendar, book vendors to fill those slots, reserve the conference\nroom, and of course, make sure there was a water bottle and stationery ready\nfor every participant on the day of the event.\n\nFast-forward to today and training executives have given way to comprehensive\nlearning frameworks that pull data from every aspect of the talent life cycle\nto create custom learning paths; they feature a whole menu of training\nprogrammes to choose from; and are likely held outside the confines of the\nconference room (typically during the commute or simply on-the-job).\n\nOh, and T&D is now called L&D \u2013 the former having typically represented the\ninstilling of specific and specialised skills, while the latter takes on a\nmore well-rounded persona of all types of learning experiences.\n\nIn this feature, let\u2019s take stock of the top trends in learning and\ndevelopment through the eyes of interviews from DBS Bank, Essence, MoEngage,\nMcCann Worldgroup Singapore, Societe Generale, and Vinda Group.\n\n### Trend 1: Learning is social\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a noticeable trend that 'going to HR and enrolling in a training or\nconference' could soon be something of the past. We learn from our social\nnetworks more than our books or classroom today,\u201d says Malaysia-based Clayton\nJ.C Tan, HR Director, Southeast Asia, at hygiene company, Vinda Group.\n\nHence, for HR and learning professionals, the role is to build a conducive\necosystem to promote self-motivated social learning for employees.\n\nThe answer, thus, lies in simple, searchable, just-in-time and bite-sized\ncontent for employees to learn while developing solutions on the job.\n\nIn line with this philosophy, banking giant DBS is out to become a learning\norganisation, that is, one which \u201cstands the test of time and makes a\nsustainable impact in the lives of our customers, employees and communities we\nlive in\u201d, as Ying Yuan Ng, Chief Learning Officer at DBS Bank, puts it.\n\nThis journey began in 2009, with a strong foundation comprising intellectual\nassets (learning road maps); physical assets (DBS Academy \u2013 learning campus);\nand technological assets (DBS Learning Hub, an AI-powered online learning\nplatform). In 2018, it started to focus on driving social and community\nlearning in a sustainable way.\n\nIn February this year, the #Learn.Share.Teach campaign was launched to create\na social learning movement. It started out by enlisting employees who were\nsubject matter experts from across the organisation and at all levels.\n\nThey created bite-sized videos using their smartphones on technical topics\nsuch as machine learning to practical tips on presentation skills and fun\nfacts such as best angles for selfies. These were uploaded onto the intranet\nand employees were encouraged to \u201clike\u201d and comment on these videos, knowing\nthat recognition motivates people to go above and beyond and reinforces\npositive behaviours.\n\n\u201cWe also created two special badges (dare to share/teach back) and e-cards on\nour peer-to-peer online recognition platform where people can recognise\ncolleagues who share and teach others,\u201d Ng says.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/08100906/Aditi-Aug-2019-mukta-ramani-yingyuan-\nprovided.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Trend 2: Learning is on-demand\n\nAs a data and measurement-driven agency, it is imperative Essence supports its\npeople in learning the science of distilling the salient points from vast\namounts of data, and the art of storytelling to bring insights powerfully to\nlife for clients.\n\nThus, at the start of this year, Essence stepped away from a white-labelled\noff-the-shelf learning management system and launched a custom-built platform\ntailored to its needs.\n\nIn tandem, it stepped up its e-learning game by investing in powerful, best-\nin-class authoring software for its in-house materials, and also offering the\nfull range of Lynda.com courses to the entire workforce.\n\nSo, while in-person workshops will continue to be a key delivery mechanism,\nthe team has recognised the need for greater availability and accessibility to\nlearning interventions, as close as possible to the point of use of the skills\nor knowledge taught.\n\n\u201cWith that in mind, we\u2019ve invested time and resources into building our\ndigitally accessed training curricula. That means our people can get the\ntraining they need when they need it, even if that\u2019s on the way to work in the\nmorning,\u201d says Veli Aghdiran, Global Vice President, Professional Development,\nEssence.\n\nReiterating the impact of on-demand learning is California-headquartered\ncustomer engagement platform MoEngage. As a product-centric company that is\ngrowing in size, from a business perspective, the goal is to develop and\nretain the right talent to manage the transformation from a small team to a\nlarge organisation.\n\nThus, the approach involves anticipating future skills benchmarks and\nproactively planning programmes to ensure the team can take on current and\nfuture challenges.\n\nJitender Panihar, Chief People Officer at MoEngage, explains the importance of\nthe leadership pipeline: \u201cMany great ideas die because they are not presented\nwell and nobody owns up to execute them. To take an idea to the next level,\nyou have to sell it to your team first, empower your team to overcome the\ndifficulties and see through its execution.\u201d\n\nTo this end, the team at MoEngage designs learner-centric, bite-size\nprogrammes that allow teams to learn quickly and be actively engaged during\nthe process. While the full-day workshops are conducted at the office, the\nsessions are recorded as well as broadcast live for remote teams.\n\nOn the horizon, MoEngage is in the process of setting up mechanisms and mobile\napps to make it easy for its employees to access training materials. \u201cWe are\nbuilding more training programmes that can be taken up on-demand so that\nemployees can take up these programmes whenever they find the time and learn\nat their own pace.\u201d\n\n> ##### Our leaders are crucial to championing change and development, so we\n> invest in programmes like My Lead and TASL (The Art and Science of\n> Leadership) to prepare them for the agile, ever-evolving, integrated and\n> digital environment.\n\n##### - Ramani Amar, Talent Director at McCann Worldgroup Singapore.\n\n### Trend 3: Learning is personalised\n\nAt marketing services group, McCann, employees are constantly reskilling and\nupskilling \u2013 so much so that it starts from the top.\n\n\u201cOur leaders are crucial to championing change and development, so we invest\nin programmes like My Lead and TASL (The Art and Science of Leadership) to\nprepare them for the agile, ever-evolving, integrated and digital\nenvironment,\u201d shares Ramani Amar, Talent Director at McCann Worldgroup\nSingapore.\n\nL&D at McCann is at the core of the overall talent management strategy, with\nthe objective of equipping employees with the knowledge and skills they need\nto excel in their roles to make a real and measurable impact on business\nperformance. This is achieved by creating personalised digital learning paths\nfor employees and it is an ongoing process of continuous coaching and\nmentoring support. \u201cIn the APAC region alone, we have seen a significant\nincrease of 200% in employee training hours,\u201d she reveals.\n\nSo, not only is personalisation imperative, but so is digitalisation.\n\n\u201cThe most successful fast-growing companies are differentiated by one thing:\ndigital enablement. Being flexible, on-demand, engaging and scalable, this new\ntype of training has transformed the way individuals and organisations learn.\u201d\n\nPutting its money where its mouth is, McCann\u2019s in-house digital programme has\nbeen honoured with two gold Brandon Hall Group Excellence awards in 2017. In\naddition, the team has clocked 3319 hours of Facebook Blueprint training.\n\n### Trend 4: Learning is business-driven\n\nIn line with the launch of its 2020 strategic plan, financial services group\nSociete Generale is focused on generating profitable and sustainable growth,\nbased on a diversified and integrated banking model.  \n\u201cWith the aim to grow, transform, deliver on costs, refocus and foster\nresponsibility, learning and development plays a very important role as the\nnew environment means enhancing knowledge, reskilling the workforce and\nshifting mindsets,\u201d says Mukta Arya, Head of Human Resources for Southeast\nAsia at Societe Generale Asia Pacific.\n\nAs such, the group\u2019s training policy has three main aims: establish a culture\nof responsibility through the deployment of a culture and conduct programme;\nintroduce new and more digital ways of learning; and give employees a more\nproactive role in their development and employability by offering a broad\nrange of training programmes and guidance, as a supplement to existing HR and\nmanagerial support.\n\nWhat helps keep this focus laser-sharp is the fact that learning and\ndevelopment sits at the centre of Societe Generale\u2019s talent management chain.\nL&D needs originate from the performance management process, with managers and\nemployees mutually agreeing on them. These then feed into the strategic talent\nidentification process, promotion process and succession planning.\n\n\u201cWe are fully aware of the challenges of employment and of global digitisation\n(new skills, new business lines, new working methods, and so on) so this needs\nanalysis helps us to be focused and invest in relevant topics for our\nworkforce,\u201d Arya explains. \u201cWe are committed to making this investment for all\nemployees across the group, and for specific needs and to develop potential\nleaders, we do invest more.\u201d\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/08101052/Aditi-Aug-2019-clayton-veli-jitender-\nprovided.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Trend 5: Learning is gamified\n\nHeading back to Vinda Group\u2019s Tan, who is passionate about social learning, he\nsays it should be driven by providing employees simple, searchable, just-in-\ntime and bite-sized content.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the organisation can then build in gamified incentives to\nmotivate learners to pick up new skills, share what they have learnt or even\ncontribute to the growing knowledge-base,\u201d he says, pointing to another key\ntrend.\n\nVinda Group is experimenting with such incentive schemes to encourage\nproduction operators to learn new skills themselves in little modules, as well\nas offer themselves as coaches to those who are keen to learn.\n\nTan also foresees a further blurring of the line between L&D and talent\nmanagement, with such regularity of just-in-time on-the-job social learning\nsurpassing the need for classroom training. \u201cThis is coming true with the\ndesign and execution of a gamified employee career pathing plan,\u201d he says.\n\nIn his view, the idea behind this is to have an employee visualise their\ncareer in the organisation mimicking that of a role-playing game character.\n\nThe employee should be able to clearly understand the competencies involved in\ntheir chosen career paths (or alternative paths); the gaps they are required\nto close to reach the next level; and where they can gain the competencies or\nexperiences needed to close these gaps.\n\nAmong all of these varied trends we unearthed, what was common to all\ninterviewees was their belief in softer skills becoming an imperative for all\nus to stay relevant and thrive in the future.\n\nDBS Bank\u2019s Ng summed up the three must-have soft skills aptly: The first is\nthe ability to \u2018anticipate\u2019. When things are happening so quickly, we have to\nthink ahead and be prepared for multiple possibilities.\n\n\u201cSecond, the willingness to \u2018self-educate\u2019 and take ownership for learning.\nLearning truly happens when we want to learn rather than when we are forced to\nlearn. Third, the capacity to \u2018adapt\u2019. In times of certainty as well as\nambiguity, we have to embrace the situation as it comes and be able to adjust\nquickly to be effective.\u201d\n\n_Lead photo / Clockwise: Interviewees Veli Aghdiran, Mukta Arya, Clayton J.C\nTan, Ying Yuan Ng, Jitender Panihar, Ramani Amar_\n\n* * *\n\nThis feature appeared in the June-July (Singapore) and Q2 (Malaysia) edition\nof _Human Resources_ magazine.

2:05 PM\n\n[Vivien Shiao](/authors/vivien-\nshiao)[vshiao@sph.com.sg](mailto:vshiao@sph.com.sg)[@VivienShiaoBT](https://www.twitter.com/@VivienShiaoBT)\n\nSINGAPORE hiring is likely to see stable growth in 2019, with top jobs in\ndemand to be analytical and data-driven in nature, according to the latest\nannual salary survey by recruitment firm Robert Walters.\n\nThese include data scientists, product management, user experience (UX)\ndesigners, and digital roles, with cybersecurity to remain a major focus, in\nthe wake of recent high-profile cyberattacks in Singapore.\n\nThe report also found that job movers in Singapore can expect pay increments\nof 5 -15 per cent in 2019, and larger hikes can be expected for candidates\nwith specialised skill sets in IT, digital and financial services.\n\nAmong employers, HR professionals with strong experience in HR technologies,\nas well as talent acquisition professionals for the technology sector will be\nsought after.\n\nHiring levels for jobs in financial services will also remain positive, with a\ncontinued focus on technical and commercial skill sets. Demand will be high\nfor skilled contracting professionals, trade finance professionals in\ncorporate banking, investment and research analysts, and IT professionals in\nthe financial services sector, said Robert Walters.\n\nIn addition, sales and marketing professionals with big data, digital,\ne-commerce and transformation experience will be in increasing demand as\ncompanies continue their digitalisation efforts.\n\nWith a limited talent pool, competition will intensify for specialists such as\nSingaporeans qualified with international and cross-border experience and\nknowledge in areas such as product management, technology law and blockchain,\nas well as supply chain and procurement professionals with niche skill sets.\n\nAccording to Robert Walters, the accounting and finance sector will see a\ndemand for professionals with tax compliance and change management expertise,\nwith skillsets in demand including a strong technical understanding and\nfamiliarity of regulatory rules, stakeholder engagement and management skills.\n\nIn the engineering sector, more jobs are expected to emerge as oil and gas\nprices recover, said Robert Walters. Strong demand is anticipated for\nprofessionals in the semiconductor, medical devices, consumer electronics and\nmanufacturing industries, especially in the research & development\ndepartments.\n\n\u201cThe best candidates look for roles they can grow into. Employers who can\ndemonstrate that they have the right teams and systems in place to support a\ncandidate\u2019s success in a role are better positioned to secure top talent,\u201d\nsaid Rob Bryson, Robert Walters managing director for Singapore.\n\n[![](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/article-\ntelegram.png)](https://t.me/BizTimes)\n\n  * [Singapore

[__](https://flipboard.com)\n    * __\n\n_This is a guest blogpost by Michael Corcoran, senior vice president at\nInformation Builders\n([www.informationbuilders.com](http://www.informationbuilders.com))._\n\nSpeaking at our [Information\nBuilders](https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/feature/New-\nInformation-Builders-CEO-targets-modern-CX-development)\u2018 Summit, IDC Group\nvice president, Dan Vesset estimated that knowledge workers spend less than\n20% of their time on data analysis. The rest of their time is taken up with\nfinding, preparing and managing data, \u201cAn organisation plagued by the lack of\nrelevant data, technology and processes, employing 1000 knowledge workers,\nwastes over $5.7 million annually searching for, but not finding information,\u201d\nwarned Vesset.\n\nVesset\u2019s comments underline the fact that data must be business-ready before\nit can generate value through advanced analytics, predictive analytics, IoT,\nor artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen from numerous enterprise case studies, co-ordination of data and\nanalytics strategies and resources is the key to generating return on\nanalytics investments.\n\n**Building the case for aligning data and analytics strategies**\n\nAs data sources become more abundant, it\u2019s important for organisations to\ndevelop a clear data strategy, which lays out how data will be acquired,\nstored, cleansed, managed, secured, used and analysed, and the business impact\nof each stage in the [data\nlifecycle](https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/tip/IoT-data-\nlifecycle-adapts-to-AI-at-the-edge).\n\nEqually, organisations need a clear analytics strategy which clarifies the\ndesired business outcomes.\n\nAnalytics strategy often follows four clear stages: starting with descriptive\nanalytics; moving to diagnostic analytics; advancing to predictive analytics\nand ultimately to [prescriptive\nanalytics](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/Prescriptive-\nanalytics).\n\nThese two strategies must be aligned because the type of analytics required by\nthe organisation will have a direct impact on data management aspects such as\nstorage and latency requirements. For example, operational analytics and\ndecision support will place a different load on the infrastructure to customer\nportal analytics, which must be able to scale to meet sudden spikes in demand.\n\nIf operational analytics and IoT are central to your analytics strategy, then\nintegration of new data formats and real-time streaming and integration will\nneed to be covered in your data strategy.\n\nSimilarly, if your organisation\u2019s analytics strategy is to deliver insights\ndirectly to customers, then data quality will be a critical factor in your\ndata strategy.\n\nWhen the analytics workload is considered, the impact on the data strategy\nbecomes clear. While a data lake project will serve your data scientists and\nback office analysts, your customers and supply chain managers may be left in\nthe dark.\n\n**Putting business outcomes first**\n\nOver the past four decades, we have seen the majority of enterprise efforts\ndevoted to back-office analytics and data science in order to deliver data-\nbased insights to management teams.\n\nHowever, the most effective analytics strategy is to deliver insights to the\npeople who can use them to generate the biggest business benefits.\n\nWe typically observe faster time to value where the analytics strategy focuses\non delivering insights directly to operational workers to support their\ndecision-making; or to add value to the services provided to partners and\ncustomers.\n\nHow to align data and analytics strategies One proven approach is to look at\nbusiness use cases for each stage in the analytics strategy. This might\ninclude descriptive management scorecards and dashboards; diagnostic back-\noffice analytics and data science; operational analytics and decision support;\nM2M and IoT; AI; or portal analytics created to enhance the customer\nexperience.\n\nIdentify all the goals and policies that must be included in your strategies.\nCreate a framework to avoid gaps in data management so that the right data\nwill be captured, harmonised and stored to allow it to be used effectively\nwithin the analytics strategy.\n\nLook at how your organisation enables access to and integration of diverse\ndata sources. Consider how it uses software, batch or real-time processing and\ndata streams from all internal systems.\n\nBy looking at goals and policies, the organisation can accommodate any changes\nto support a strong combined data and analytics strategy.\n\n**Focus on data quality**\n\nOnce you have defined your data and analytics strategies, it\u2019s critical to\naddress data quality. Mastering data ensures that your people can trust the\nanalytic insights derived from it. Taking this first step will greatly\nsimplify your organisation\u2019s subsequent analytics initiatives.\n\nAs data is the fuel of the analytics engine, performance will depend on data\nrefinement.\n\nThe reality for many data professionals is that they struggle to gain\norganisation-wide support for a data strategy. Business managers are more\ninclined  to invest in tangibles, such as dashboards Identifying the financial\nbenefits of investing in a data quality programme, or a master data management\ninitiative is a challenge, unless something has previously gone wrong which\nhas convinced the management team that valuable analytics outputs are directly\ntied to quality data inputs.\n\nTo gain their support for a data strategy consider involving line of business\nmanagers by asking them what the overall goals and outputs are for their\nanalytics initiatives. An understanding the desired outputs of data will then\nguide the design of the data infrastructure.\n\n**Pulling together**\n\nOften we see data management, analytics and business intelligence being\nhandled by different teams, using different approaches, within the same\norganisation. This can create a disconnection between what the business wants\nto achieve from data assets and what is possible. Data and analytics\nstrategies need to be aligned so that there is a clear link between the way\nthe organisation manages its data and how it gains business insights.\n\n  * Include people from different departments who possess a cross section of skills: business, finance, marketing, customer service, IT, business intelligence, data science and statistics. Understand how these colleagues interact and what is important to them in terms of data outputs.\n  * Take into account how data interconnects with your organisation\u2019s daily business processes. This will help answer questions about the required data sources, connections, latency and inputs to your analytics strategy. Ensuring that they work together connects data to business value.\n  * Finally, consider the technology components that are required. This entails looking at different platforms that deliver the required data access, data integration, data cleansing, storage and latency, to support your required business outcomes.\n\n**Measuring the benefits**\n\nThe following organisations aligned their data and analytics strategies to\ndeliver clear business outcomes:\n\n  * [Food for the Poor](https://www.foodforthepoor.org/) used high quality data and analytics to reach its fund raising target more quickly: reducing the time taken to raise $10 million from six months to six days, so that it could more quickly help people in dire need.\n  * [Lipari Foods](https://liparifoods.com/) integrated IoT, logistics and geo location data, enabling it to analyse supply chain operations so that it uses warehouse space more efficiently, allowing it to run an agile operation with a small team of people.\n  * [St Luke\u2019s University Health Network](https://www.slhn.org/) mastered its data as part of its strategy to target specific households to make them aware of specialised medications, reaching 98 per cent uptake in one of its campaigns focused on thirty households. \u201cRather than getting mired in lengthy data integration and master data management (MDM) processes without any short-term benefits, stakeholders decided to focus on time-to-value by letting business priorities drive program deliverables,\u201d explains Dan Foltz, program manager for the EDW and analytics implementation at St. Luke\u2019s. \u201cWe simultaneously proceeded with data integration, data governance, and BI development to achieve our business objectives as part of a continuous flow. The business had new BI assets to meet their needs in a timely fashion, while the MDM initiative improved those assets and enabled progressively better analysis,\u201d he adds. This approach allowed the St. Luke\u2019s team to deliver value throughout the implementation.\n\nThese are just a few examples of organisations having a cohesive data strategy\nand analytics strategy which has enabled them to generate better value from\ndiverse and complex data sets.\n\n**Gaining better value from data**\n\nWhile analytics initiatives often begin with one or two clear business cases,\nit\u2019s important to ensure that the overall data analytics strategy is bigger\nthan any single initiative. Organisations that focus on individual projects\nmay find that they have overlooked key data infrastructure requirements once\nthey try to scale.\n\nAs Grace Auh, Business Intelligence and Decision Support manager at Markham\nStouffville Hospital, observed during Information Builders\u2019 Summit, \u201cAre you\nconnecting the dots? Or are you just collecting them?\u201d\n\nCapturing data in silos to serve tactical requirements diminishes the\nvisibility and value that it can deliver to the whole organisation. The\nultimate path to creating value is to align your data and analytic strategies\nto each other and most importantly to the overall strategy and execution of\nyour organisation.\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/ux/responsive/img/reg_wrapper_curl.png)\n\nDownload this free guide\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/downloadOffers/images/COVID-19_in_APAC_Tech_industry_lessons_and_innovations_DLO.png)\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/ux/responsive/img/reg_cover_curl.png)\n\n## COVID-19 in APAC: Tech industry lessons & innovations\n\nWhile the ongoing pandemic is taking its toll on many businesses, it also\npresents new opportunities for organisations to improve productivity and\ncustomer engagement through better use of technology.

Kota Menara Ufuk 's HR team ideated and executed strategic\ninterventions that led to 28 new and revamped HR policies._\n\n**Vital stats:** Dr Loo Leap Han has about 18 years of HR industry experience\nin manufacturing, healthcare and infrastructure construction, across themes\nsuch as talent management, employee competency gap analysis, HR financial and\ncosting, workplace bullying, and more. He earned his doctor of philosophy from\nUniversity of Malaya, with strategic HR management, organisational culture and\nfirm performance being his areas of expertise.\n\n* * *\n\nKota Menara Ufuk (KMU) was established in 1999 by Founder and MD, Ng Chor\nHuat, with just 10 employees and a one-ton lorry.\n\nToday, the group is considered a classic case study of a successful family-\nowned business with a vision to be a top-ofmind market specialist in sewerage\ntunnelling infrastructure, locally and in Asia. It is backed by other\ncompanies under the KMU Group such as Eiscon Construction, Eiscon Engineering,\nGreat Tunnel, and more.\n\nGroup Head of HR, Dr Loo Leap Han, joined the firm in mid-2017 to lead HR and\nAdministration at the group and site level, with a team of nine under him.\n\nThis team leads strategic HR interventions for the approximately 1,000-strong\nworkforce, comprising 74% of non-skilled workers, 15% of subject matter\nexperts (also called SMEs, with professional degrees/masters and\nqualifications), 9% of semi-skilled workers (with diplomas and professional\nqualifications), and 2% of corporate office staff.\n\n### Q Developing such specialised construction and sewerage projects takes\npersistent innovation and intense research. How would you describe the company\nculture at KMU?\n\nWe embrace innovation and drive continuous improvement in our working culture.\nWe constantly strive for new ideas to enhance our performance on process,\nperson, team or organisation. The founder instilled the philosophy of, \"our\npeople are extremely important and we must take care of them\", which drives\nself-belonging, caring and openness. As a result, our culture tends to be\nfamily-oriented and our employees stay with us for a long time. Employees'\nbonding through the workplace enhances and motivates them to perform at their\nbest and have a healthy mindset.\n\nIn 2017, KMU introduced the \"We Culture\" campaign, with the tag line \"can-do\nand right-do mindset\" to show our commitment to the delivery of success. We\nhad storytelling sessions from pioneers to share about the challenges and\nsuccesses of the company and how \"we\" have survived and sustained to this\ndate. This was legacy sharing for the younger workforce to inculcate KMU's\nculture into their working system. No fancy or expensive programme involved.\nIn fact, the idea was not derived from the management team, but from the blue-\ncollar employees. Subsequently, we changed the tag line to a \"can-do, right-do\nand feel-do mindset\". The outcome of the campaign was positive and engaging.\n\n> ##### We constantly strive for new ideas to enhance our performance on\n> process, person, team or organisation.\n\n### Q 2016 was pivotal to KMU's growth story as the decision was taken to\ncorporatise the organisation and bring synergy among the three pillars \u2013 HR,\noperations and finance. What changes were planned as a result of this policy?\n\nIn late 2016, the Board of Directors (BOD) decided to reform the company\nstructure to corporate management. KMU Eiscon Holding was formed and Ng Chor\nHuat was the Group MD along with two business partners.\n\nMy first question to the BOD was: \"This is a family-owned business, and now we\nare moving to a corporate management. Should you bring in outsiders for\nleadership positions?\" The answer was \"yes\". Evidently, the management was\nopen to welcome new talent who will give different perspectives to better\ndevelop the company to the next level and amplify the leadership in the\norganisation. As for the changes to the three pillars, under Operations we\nlooked at importing expertise from Germany and Hong Kong, and the rethinking\nof cost-effective methods, among much else. For Finance, we aimed for\ntransparency of P&L announcements to all key personnel, introducing a case\nflow mobility facility, and more.\n\nUnder HR, which is where my team and I came in, we looked at about 10 key\ninitiatives: develop a nomination and remuneration committee; introduce a\npanel of moderators committee for a bonus, increment and promotion exercise;\nenrich the employee compensation and reward scheme; form an HR core\nspecialisation unit; activate a \"HR Ways of Work\" concept and champion HR lean\nmanagement; an HR roadshow series across corporate and sites for HR town hall\ndiscussions; enhance employer branding for talent attraction and acquisition;\ndevelop succession planning for business continuity; use HR analytics for\nbusiness decision making; and revamp HR policies and processes, and remove HR\nred tape.\n\n### Q What did the first 100 days of this project look like?\n\nLots of coaching and briefing sessions were conducted in English, Malay and\nChinese for all the managers and persons in- charge for each business unit on\nthe new implementation. Based on everyone\u2019s feedback, we made improvements to\nthe new initiatives. We also stressed that all managers were \u201cHR managers\u201d\nwhen it came to the implementation. Everyone needed to learn the basic HR\nmanagement and principles.\n\n### Q I understand the first task was to undertake a talent segmentation\nexercise, that is, to better segment the subject matter experts into\nspecialised areas as opposed to multitasking which created a number of issues.\nTell us what the employee turnover rate looked like in 2017 to warrant this\ninitiative.\n\nUpon conducting an analysis of attrition for the previous three years, we\nfound the average attrition rate was between 2%-4% among the semi-skilled up\nto the professional group. Exit interview findings pointed to a mismatch of\nskill sets to carry out assigned tasks that were not within their expertise,\nleading to job dissatisfaction. Career-specific reasons were also cited \u2013 for\nexample, career focus changed, offered a new position from another company or\nlack of growth opportunities at KMU.\n\nIn summary, the push factors were very much linked to intrinsic motivation\n(knowing that KMU pay structures and reward systems are at par with market\npractice, or even better). We were lacking talent to uphold and execute huge,\nnew projects, for example, the current RM500 million value project in Ipoh and\nthe RM100 million project in Kuantan. As for the ongoing projects, we are yet\nto fill up certain key vacant positions.\n\n> ##### We removed the concept of \u201csameness\u201d in reward distribution to\n> differentiated reward allocation to deserving employees.\n\n### Q How did you execute this plan, and more importantly, how did you change\nthe mindsets around the importance of segmenting multi-skilled versus multi-\ntasking to retain staff?\n\nThe practice of talent management and development kickstarted when I came on\nboard in mid 2017 (after analysing the attrition and push-factor records). We\nencountered the mismatch of job profiling, mainly in the operations team.\nThus, the initiative was for HR and functional managers to collaborate to\nconduct job profiling exercises to identify the skill sets of our employees.\n\nHow we executed this was, first, HR presented the KMU talent competency gap\nanalysis findings to the BOD and all business unit heads. The key action items\nwere to identify important skills, assess current skills and build action\nplans to either train or hire for skill gaps. The BOD saw the seriousness of\nthe findings in relation to the quality of work, delivery of the end product,\nand costs of repair works caused by poor technical decision making.\n\nWe then designed and developed the KMU talent management framework, which\nfocused on talent segmentation into three groups: **(a) Talent that drives the\ncompany goals** \u2013 strategic roles with specialised skills or knowledge (need\nto strengthen and sustain to driving the company\u2019s longterm plans and\nstrategies). **(b) Talent that supports the company goals** \u2013 subject matter\nexperts with unique core skills (need to protect and develop to delivering the\ntasks). **(c) Talent that is impacted by the company goals** \u2013 talent whose\nskills sets no longer align with the company\u2019s direction (need to redeploy and\nretrain).\n\nThis was followed by charting career growth plans, with a special focus on the\ntarget group (b), preparing them as future KMU leaders to lead upcoming\nprojects at different regions. This included sponsorship for education and\nprofessional upgrading, and multiple training and learning opportunities.\n\nFinally, we reformed the performance management practices whereby the reward\nand incentive schemes are based on individual and team-based accomplishments.\nWe removed the concept of \u201csameness\u201d in reward distribution to differentiated\nreward allocation to deserving employees.\n\n### Q The second priority was around lean management, abolishing unnecessary\nbureaucratic systems and simplifying decision making. How was this undertaken?\n\nHR introduced the \"Ways of Work\" methodology focusing on creating a culture of\ndelivering value to our clients and eliminating inefficient processes or\nprocedures. Employees were trained to identify wasted time and effort in their\nown job and to come up with the best solution to simply the process. This\nencouraged better working relationships among colleagues as the processes were\nlinked to other department/business units.\n\nSimilarly, the management decentralised the organisational structure at\nproject operations to achieve efficient operations. Project managers were\ngiven greater autonomy to make their own decisions and to allow them to make\nbetter use of the knowledge and experience they had gained. For a growing\ncompany such as KMU, decentralisation can facilitate the process of expansion.\nFor example, when opening a new project in a different geographic area,\ndecentralisation allows the new project team unit to operate as an independent\nentity, meaning it can respond more easily to the specific needs of the area.\n\nLikewise, the reward and incentive plan was divided into two approaches:\nperiodic goals (mainly for the operations team) and year-end goals (mainly for\nthe corporate office teams). The former is to encourage the construction team\nto complete the project earlier (by stages) than the targeted timeline. The\nlatter is standard company practice. The head of the department is then\nempowered to determine the quantum and amount of reward and incentive of the\nemployee.\n\n### Q How easy or how difficult has it been to roll out this two-pronged road\nmap? More importantly, what challenges did you face, and how did you clear\nthose hurdles successfully?\n\nThe first challenge was management changes. As KMU\u2019s business grows, its\nstrategies, structures and internal processes grow along with it.\nConsolidating all the company\u2019s practices is a major task. Some senior team\nmembers have had a hard time coping with these changes. In these cases,\nmanagement and HR both communicated the benefits of the change for everyone\nthrough regular staff meetings and dialogue. When your team understands the\nwhy, how and when of the change, they\u2019ll be more likely to get on board.\n\nThe second challenge was the designing of a competitive compensation and\nrewards scheme. KMU is a SME and must compete not only with businesses of a\nsimilar size, but also with big corporations in the infrastructure industry.\nAs such, HR came up with a system to reward for excellent performance, and\noffer incentive programmes such as profit sharing, which are a winwin for both\nthe employee and company.\n\nThe third challenge was in retaining senior talent. KMU doesn\u2019t have the funds\nfor retirement plans, expensive insurance plans and other costly items that\nour larger competitors do.\n\nIn light of this, the management incorporated Employer Provident Fund\ncontributions that range from 12%-30% to employees (by category) as retirement\nplans; a group term life policy to all the employees; sponsorship for a\nmaster\u2019s programme; and individual bonus recognition in order to retain\ntalent.\n\nThe fourth challenge is leadership development, whereby HR is expected to\nprovide the structure, processes and tools to select the best and develop the\nfuture leaders of the organisation. Currently, KMU has about 2% key personnel\nand 15% subject matter experts in our workforce. Our desired number is 10% and\n35% by 2020. To hit this target, we have initiated employee competency gap\nanalysis exercises to identify the competency gaps, what skill sets are\nrequired, how to close the gaps and the best methodology predicting success at\nthe workplace. The findings will enable KMU to build the next set of leaders.\n\nThe final challenge is creating a good employee experience. It\u2019s common to\nfind staff get burned out in this industry (the job expectations, timelines,\nunforeseen geographical roadblocks such as rock and soil issues). To combat\nthis, KMU invests in employee wellness, solicits and acts on employee\nfeedback, celebrates individual and team achievements, and organises \"lunch\nand learn\" sessions to create a sense of belonging to the company.\n\n> ##### The three success factors in launching such large-scale change\n> initiatives? Transforming leadership, continuous communication and a\n> purpose-driven performance culture.\n\n### Q How do you measure progress on this journey?\n\nThis has been measured in multiple ways. The average attrition rate as at\nDecember 2018 is 1.5%, even as we\u2019ve had 11 promotions (key personnel and\nsubject matter experts) as at 2018. While 28 new and revamped HR policies were\nimplemented as at December 2018. Additionally, 15 HR roadshows were conducted;\nas well as HR town hall meetings and briefings on HR policies and programmes\nas at December 2018.\n\nWe have revamped our group performance appraisal format and applications, and\ngroup remuneration and benefits structure as at January 2018. We have also\nintroduced a better and value-added group health policy with less cost, which\nhas resulted in savings of RM200k worth of premium across the group of\ncompanies for 2018. Finally, we have organised company trips to Hong Kong (two\nbatches/two trips), Korea (two batches/two trips) and a cruise (one batch/one\ntrip). Participants were from the supervisor level up to the management level.\n\nThe three success factors in launching such large-scale change initiatives?\nTransforming leadership, continuous communication and a purpose-driven\nperformance culture.\n\n### Q What's the one myth you would change about working in the construction\nsector?\n\nThe myth is that construction is deemed to be a simple profession that is made\nup of people slinging tools and not a place for women. On the contrary,\nconstruction requires the ability to think inside and outside the box; and\nrequires detail-oriented, creative, innovative, as well as in-the-moment\nproblem-solving skills that are required like many other professions. This\nprofession, today, sees both men and women work as respected professionals\n(registered profession with Board of Engineers Malaysia) on the same\nconstruction teams and earning equal pay. You can find talented, intelligent\nand well-trained women in this industry, and employers and co-workers\nappreciate their professional skills.\n\n_Photo / provided_\n\n* * *\n\n**Read the Q1 edition of Human Resources, Malaysia:**\n\n[![hrmy_q119](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/03/05155106/hrmy_q119-135x180.jpg)](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/)\n\n\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

help to generate a pipeline of students\nwho are skilled in accounting and data analytics in Singapore.\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | November 30, 2018\n\nTopics: [Asia-Pacific](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/apac/) | [Learning\nand Development](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/learning-development/)

|\n[Singapore](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/singapore/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pic-40.jpg)\n\n\n\nUnited Overseas Bank (UOB) has forged a scholarship with Singapore Management\nUniversity (SMU) to build up Singapore\u2019s talent pipeline and equip them with\ndata skillsets.\n\nThe initiative is part of efforts to prepare for the increasingly critical\nrole data plays in driving informed business decisions and strategies for\norganisations.\n\nThe inaugural UOB-SMU's Master of Science in Accounting (MSA) scholarship has\nbeen awarded to two enterprising students in the SMU\u2019s MSA (Data and\nAnalytics) programme.\n\nSMU students David Djapri and Zhang Tongtong were selected as the first two\nrecipients of the scholarship, having achieved outstanding academic results.\n\nThey will undergo the MSA programme without worrying about funding, and will\nalso be able to deepen their skills and expertise through a 12-week internship\nprogramme at UOB.\n\n\u201cAt UOB, we are committed to developing the skillsets needed to succeed in the\ndigital economy. The UOB-SMU MSA Scholarship is one way in which we can help\nspur higher learning in the area of data and analytics \u2013 something that is\nvital in our data-driven and interconnected world,\u201d Richard Lowe, Chief Data\nOfficer, UOB, said.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to receive UOB\u2019s support for two of our best students with\nthis scholarship and for their recognition of the value of our MSA programme\nnot only to its students but, through them, to the financial sector as a\nwhole,\u201d said Cheng Qiang, the dean of SMU's School of Accountancy.\n\n\u201cThe MSA programme is the first specialised Master programme in accounting\ndata and analytics in Asia. Unlike other postgraduate analytics programmes,\nthe MSA\u2019s data and analytics track goes deep into the application of data\ntechnology in the accounting and finance domain.\"\n\n\"Armed with the knowledge of machine learning and data analytics, our\ngraduates will be better equipped to bring value to their workplaces, from\nbanks and audit firms to technology companies,\u201d he added.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fuob-\npartners-smu-data-skillsets%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=UOB+partners+with+SMU+to+build+up+data+skillsets+of+workforce&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fuob-\npartners-smu-data-skillsets%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fuob-\npartners-smu-data-skillsets%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Meanwhile, employees in digital-related roles expect an\nincrease of between 10 to 15% when switching jobs.\n\nThe report noted that there is a huge demand for IT security roles, as well as\ndigital transformation-led technical roles. \"Digital transformation is the\nongoing focus, but cybersecurity prefaces many organisations' ability to\nimprove operational technology,\" the release read.\n\nSimilarly, companies seek local talents who can fill roles related to\nspecialised ecommerce, digital marketing and data science, but face a shortage\nof supply.\n\nCompanies are also reportedly seeking leaders who can drive digital strategy\nwhile anticipating technology disruptors.\n\n\"Brands don't expect that new hires will have all the right skill sets on day\none - but they look for those willing and able to adapt and learn,\" says\nShinjika Shukla, associate director for Technology Practice at Michael Page\nSingapore. \"This means a learning-based mindset, and overarching logic-based\nand problem solving skills. In a fast-changing market, those with the passion\nand curiosity to evolve will be those who land the best roles.\"\n\nIT security leads, data scientists, digital transformation-led roles, and\nsoftware developers and lead automation experts were the most in-demand roles\nin the technology industry. Michael Page found that on average tech employees\nearn between $10,000 monthly (senior engineer, development, and architecture)\nup to $22,000 monthly (chief technological officer).\n\nIn the digital industry, the most in-demand roles include digital marketing\nmanager, performance marketing manager, digital content manager, digital\nanalytics manager, and CRM manager. On average, digital roles earn between\n$9,600 monthly (user experience web analytics) up to $23,000 monthly\n(ecommerce director).\n\nThe report also identified security, data and decision science, and cloud\nspecialists and developers were identified as \"trending\" skills amongst the\ntechnology sector; whilst digital trending and innovation, digital marketing,\nand ecommerce-related skills as \"trending\" skills in digital.  \n\n\nDo you know more about this story?

It is\nnot known how soon the technology might arrive in the UK.\n\n**[Businesses may need to compensate workers facing cancelled\nshifts](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/compensation-cancelled-shifts/\n\"Businesses may need to compensate workers facing cancelled shifts\")**\n\n**[Gig economy doubles in three years](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/gig-\neconomy-doubles-in-three-years/ \"Gig economy doubles in three years\")**\n\n**[Pimlico\u2019s Charlie Mullins: Gig economy reform needed, but don\u2019t vilify\nus](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/pimlico-plumbers-charlie-mullins-gig-\neconomy-reform/ \"Pimlico\u2019s Charlie Mullins: Gig economy reform needed, but\ndon\u2019t vilify us\")**\n\n\u201cWe believe that finding work shouldn\u2019t have to be a job in itself,\u201d reads an\nUber blog post.\n\n\u201cFor positions as diverse as being a prep cook, warehouse worker, a commercial\ncleaner or event staff, Uber Works aims to make it easier to find and claim a\nshift.\u201d\n\nThe service helps employers fill last-minute casual vacancies but can also\nassign workers for regular shifts on an ongoing basis: \u201cWhether you\u2019re looking\nfor one or 100 workers, or if it\u2019s last-minute or weeks away, we can help you\nfind the right people to fill a shift,\u201d reads the website.\n\nJust like the ride-hailing app, the Uber Works platform includes the ability\nto leave feedback. The concept is not new. Freelancing platforms like Wonolo\nand Shiftgig are comparable and other platforms like Upwork offer a similar\nservice for the professional sector.\n\nBut the widespread recognition of its brand could provide Uber with an\nadvantage.\n\n\u201cUber Works presents a real opportunity to help improve the quality and access\nof work through technology,\u201d said the company. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s clear we are just\nat the beginning of the journey. The Uber Works team is committed to the task\nahead as we learn and explore how we can be a part of the solution.\u201d\n\nSignificantly, unlike when Uber disrupted the taxi market, Uber Works says it\nis taking a \u201cpartnership approach\u201d. It says it is collaborating with staffing\nagencies, including TrueBlue, one of the largest agencies in the US, who will\n\u201cemploy, pay and handle worker benefits\u201d.\n\nThis strategy is likely to avoid some of the problems the company is facing as\nmarkets tighten regulations. The [state of California last month passed\nlegislation](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/landmark-gig-economy-bill-\nclose-to-becoming-law-in-california/) to recognise gig workers as employees,\ngiving them more rights.\n\nUber Works says it is committed to delivering services that support \u201cskill up-\nleveling\u201d and people returning to work.\n\n\u201cAs part of this effort,\u201d reads the blog, \u201cwe are working to expand our\neducational partnership with [Arizona State University] to Uber Works so\neligible workers on the platform can have access to online classes. We are\nalso engaging with local Chicago organizations that can provide skills\ntraining.\u201d\n\nPatrick Beharelle, chief executive of TrueBlue, said: \u201cTrueBlue has been\ndriving digital disruption within the staffing industry with our JobStack and\nAffinix offerings, and our relationship with Uber Works is a component of that\nstrategy.\u201d\n\nTrueBlue is the parent company of PeopleScout which last week [launched the\nAffinix platform in Europe](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/peoplescout-\nlaunches-award-winning-affinix-product-in-europe/).\n\n## HR Director

analytics\ntechnology. With the bolt-on, McKinsey significantly beefs up its digital\nprocurement practice, and launches the new 'Spend Intelligence by McKinsey'\noffering._\n\nFounded in Germany in 2005, Orpheus helps organisations optimise their\nexternal expenditure. The company's software helps procurement functions gain\ntransparency on all spend data across the enterprise. Experts from Orpheus\nthen help clients with analysing spend data, identifying value capture\npotential in product categories, creating concepts to measure success and with\nexecution.\n\nMcKinsey will now integrate Orpheus into its Operations practice, specifically\ninto its offering for procurement leaders. The strategy and management\nconsulting giant will combine Orpheus with its own expertise in the field to\nbring a new offering to clients: Spend Intelligence by McKinsey.\n\nPhilipp Radtke, a senior partner at [McKinsey & Company](/firms/mckinsey-\ncompany \"McKinsey & Company\") and global co-leader of the Operations Practice,\nsaid; \"The offering is a powerful combination of Orpheus' advanced platform\ntechnology, and McKinsey's industry expertise and content-rich services in\ndigital procurement.\"\n\n![McKinsey buys Orpheus and launches Spend Intelligence\noffering](/illustrations/news/detail/2020-02-10-084145221-McKinsey-buys-\nOrpheus-and-launches-Spend-Intelligence-offering.jpg)\n\n\"Spend Intelligence by McKinsey will offer clients deeper and more consistent\ninsights into opportunities for spend optimisation through an innovative\ncombination of data, software, category sourcing expertise, and services. It\nwill enable spend transparency, spend and cost analytics and value capture\nmanagement.\"\n\nDesigned to support CPOs, CFOs and category managers, Spend Intelligence by\nMcKinsey will be a \"core element of the digitally-enabled procurement function\nof the future\", added Radtke.\n\nThe proposition includes traditional consulting services such as strategic\nsourcing assessment and spend cubes, as well as change and program management\nand solution services such as technology licenses and spend data processing.\n\nFor Orpheus, the change of ownership marks a new journey in its fifteen year\nhistory. \"Together we can create a much richer solution and service offering,\"\nsaid Jorg Dittrich, the CEO of Orpheus. He is joined in the move to the\nconsulting firm by the full 35-strong team of Orpheus, including leaders\nMichael Lauer, Christian Ruck, Jorg Mengeler, Marco Pachovsky and Matthias\nSchumann.\n\nOrpheus was backed by among others UVC Partners, which provided the firm an\ninitial seed investment in 2012. \"Orpheus is a pioneer in the procurement\nsoftware space with its specialised spend analytics and savings management\nsolution. UVC Partners is happy with the successful acquisition by McKinsey &\nCompany,\" remarked Ingo Potthof, Managing Partner at the German financial\ninvestor.\n\n  * [ __](mailto:?&subject=McKinsey buys

financial skills in Singapore will\nintensify when five new digital banking licences are handed out.\n\nBy: [Justin Harper](https://hrmasia.com/author/justin-harper/ \"Posts by Justin\nHarper\") |

it plays catch up with\nHong Kong. Five new digital bank licences will be issued, and this time they\nare open to non-banks to apply.\n\nThe growth of digital banking will put more pressure on employers looking to\nhire top talent with technology skills. The new digital banks are then\nexpected to start their operations by the middle of 2021.\n\nThe Singapore Salary Benchmark 2020 report from recruitment firm Michael Page\nhighlights the increased efforts firms are making towards digital\ntransformation in preparation of stronger digital banking infrastructure.\n\nNilay Khandelwal, Managing Director of Michael Page Singapore, said: \u201cWith\nthese advances in digital banking, Singapore is well-placed to hone her value\nproposition as a hub for premium high-tech regional and global services.\nExpertise in different transaction platforms, digitisation, Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) and analytics will be in high demand.\u201d\n\nThe Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has also announced plans to set\nup an innovation centre in Singapore, which will create opportunities for tech\ntalent with Big Data, cloud computing and information security skills.\n\nMore firms in Singapore are investing heavily in networks and systems which\nwill drive further employment in cybersecurity. These areas of niche\ntechnology are likely to command up to 15% in salary increment when switching\njobs, according to Michael Page.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fnew-\nskills-will-be-needed-for-digital-banking-revolution%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=New+skills+will+be+needed+for+digital+banking+revolution&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fnew-\nskills-will-be-needed-for-digital-banking-revolution%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fnew-\nskills-will-be-needed-for-digital-banking-revolution%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

NeoData is the only company to have won the Oracle APAC\nspecialised partner of the year four years in a row.\n\nThe company works with customers in a range of industries such as financial\nservices, higher education, technology, media and telco and all levels of\ngovernment, with \"deep functional knowledge\" in finance, HR and procurement,\ncustomer experience and supply chain systems.\n\nNeoData's CEO Dr. Tas Osianlis and COO Robert Loughnane will join Deloitte's\nconsulting enterprise technology practice as partners, and CTO Gergo Bacskai\nas principle, along with 20 staff that will join Deloitte's offices in Sydney,\nMelbourne and Perth. Deloitte's APAC business already includes more than 3500\nOracle cloud experts.\n\n \"NeoData is Oracle's strongest and most experienced business intelligence and\nanalytics implementation partner in the ANZ region,\" said Deloitte's Oracle\nlead Peter Nikandrow.\n\n\"We've worked with Tas and his team for over a year on multiple projects; so\nwe've been courting for a while and it's great to be able to take our\nrelationship to the next level and have the team join as part of the Deloitte\nfamily.\"\n\nOsianlis added: \"We've always seen data as a valuable asset, if it's used in\nthe context of the best business practices. Planning, operational management\nand innovation are all vastly different processes with different data\nrequirements. There is great value in data, if business processes are great.\nWe see Deloitte's enormous depth in these areas to be highly complementary.\n\n\"We are all passionate about our customers, their success, and the\ntechnologies that can be applied to realise great outcomes - we are very\nexcited to be joining Deloitte.\"\n\nDeloitte last acquired an Oracle specialist in 2014 with Dataweave. Earlier\nthis year, Deloitte also acquired Sydney Splunk partner [Converging\nData.](https://www.crn.com.au/news/deloitte-acquires-sydney-splunk-partner-\nconverging-data-520512)\n\nGot a news tip for our journalists?

Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement. [Find out more about the webinars\n\u00bb](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\n\n### _Among others,_ Catherine Low, Country Manager of ING in Singapore _,\naffirms to_ Jerene Ang _that servant leadership can make a positive\ndifference, even though the contribution of such leadership is usually not\nhighly visible to others._\n\n**Q How would you describe your journey with ING so far? What has been your\nmost memorable moment with the organisation?**\n\nAfter fifteen-plus years with ING, I am still learning new things every day.\nING gives a lot of freedom and support to employees to chart their personal\ndevelopment, especially for employees who take personal responsibility for\ntheir own learning and development. For example, I have been given the\nopportunity to move from a specialised lending function in trade and commodity\nfinancing, to a general management role as the Singapore Country Manager.\n\nWhat I also appreciate about ING is its diverse and international mix of\nemployees, and the relatively flat organisation structure that recognises the\nvalue of employee contribution apart from a hierarchical role. For example, in\n2014-2017, I was appointed to the bank\u2019s global leadership council despite the\nfact that I was not the most senior employee in Asia in terms of hierarchy.\n\n**Q How would you define your leadership style?**\n\nI believe in servant leadership, and hope to keep growing as one. The needs of\nemployees \u2013 to perform, grow professionally, and find fulfilment and meaning\nin their job scope and job environment \u2013 are put ahead of quid pro quo\nconsiderations or even the leader's own self-interest. A servant leader does\nnot manage from a position of power or authority, but uses influence to\nfacilitate and serve, and to allow others to shine.\n\nMany people confuse service with servitude or subservience. Serving that is\npurely driven out of the primary desire to help others, if combined with\nleadership skills, can make a positive difference, even though the\ncontribution of such servant leadership is usually not highly visible to\nothers.\n\n**Q When you\u2019re struggling with stress or a bad day, how do you unwind and re-\nenergise yourself?**\n\nA few years ago I went through a period of illness. Having emerged from that,\nwith a much deeper appreciation for health and relationships and my personal\nfaith, work troubles no longer become mountains in my mind. I am blessed to\nhave a group of caring friends and trusted colleagues with whom I can talk\nabout the issues I am facing, or turn to for help and advice.\n\n**Q Having been in the banking sector for more than 20 years, how have you\nseen the industry evolve from a talent standpoint? Do you find the oft-cited\ngender diversity imbalance in the sector improving?**\n\nGender diversity has certainly improved in the area of corporate banking. When\nI first became a corporate banker in the \u201890s, my manager told me that the\nability to entertain clients over meals, karaoke, drinks, or to play golf were\nconsidered as strengths.\n\nAs a woman with family commitments, I challenged my manager to let me develop\nmy own client portfolio based on the ability to deliver products and services\nwell to the corporates, rather than having to entertain individuals within\nthose corporates outside of office hours.\n\nMy corporate client portfolio grew rapidly, and I believe that I was one of\nthe pioneers in the then male-dominated commodity trade financing industry who\nshowed that females can become senior bankers.\n\n**Q What do you think organisations can do to empower more women leaders like\nyourself?**\n\nMany organisations already dedicate resources to building and maintaining\ndiversity, including gender diversity. Yet gender diversity is still not at\nideal levels at very senior levels. This may require intentional intervention\nin the beginning, such as targeted sponsorship of high potential female talent\nto ensure a robust pipeline for key senior positions. I believe that once\nthere are more female role models at key positions, there will be a natural\nvirtuous snowball effect.\n\n**Q What is your view of human resources as a business function? How closely\ndo you work with your HR head and on what kind of issues?**\n\nHuman capital is key for organisations, hence the importance of human\nresources as a business function. A dollar of financial capital is the same\ndollar everywhere, and how it is deployed determines the return on that\ncapital.\n\nHowever, every employee is different, how they are enabled and developed\ndetermines how well financial capital is used to generate economic and social\nbenefits for all stakeholders. Any business leader will have to work closely\nwith HR as a business partner in the different areas of recruitment, learning\nand development, compensation and performance management.\n\n**Q Describe your ideal CHRO.**\n\nAn ideal CHRO is forward-thinking, and goes beyond running a well-oiled\nadministration function to being a business partner who can attract, retain\nand build talent according to the strategic long-term requirements of the\norganisation.\n\n**Q If not this career, what alternative career path might you have chosen?**\n\nDespite being in banking for so long, I don't feel that I am in one career\npath, because the learning experience along my personal journey has been so\nvaried, and there is so much to learn from and contribute to, every day. This\nis why I have not actively considered other careers so far.\n\n_Photo / provided_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

Meanwhile, there\ncould be a total gain of two million jobs in computer and mathematical and\narchitecture and engineering related fields.\n\nDespite the tendency for manufacturing and production roles to bottom out, the\nroles have relatively good potential for upskilling, redeployment and\nproductivity enhancements through technology.\n\nThe World Economic Forum\u2019s recently published \u201cThe Future of Jobs\u201d elaborated\nthe top 10 skills demanded in 2020.\n\n**Top 10 skills in 2020**\n\n  1. Complex problem solving.\n  2. Critical thinking.\n  3. Creativity.\n  4. People management.\n  5. Co-ordinating with others.\n  6. Emotional intelligence.\n  7. Judgment and decision making.\n  8. Service orientation.\n  9. Negotiation.\n  10. Cognitive flexibility.\n\n**Top 10 skills in 2005 (compared with 2020 statistics)**\n\n  1. Complex problem solving.\n  2.

Judgment and decision making (+1).\n  9. ~~Active listening.*~~\n  10. Creativity (+7).\n\n*drop out of Top 10 skills in 2020\n\nNegotiation and flexibility were high on the list of skills for 2015, however,\nin 2020 machines will replace the decision making process. Active listening\nwill be dropped from the top 10, and replaced by emotional intelligence.\n\n**Future workforce strategies, industries overall\uff1a Share of respondents\npursuing strategy (%)**\n\nInvest in reskilling current employees (65%).  \nSupport mobility and job rotation (39%).  \nCollaborate, educational institutions (25%).  \nTarget female talent (25%).  \nAttract foreign talent (22%).  \nOffer apprenticeships (22%).  \nCollaborate, other companies across industries (14%).  \nCollaborate, other companies in industry (12%).  \nTarget minorities\u2019 talent (12%).  \nHire more short-term workers (11%).\n\nTwo job types were perceived by respondents as critically important in 2020:\ndata analysts and specialised sales representatives.\n\nCompanies expect data analysts will help them make sense and derive insights\nfrom the data generated by technological disruptions. Specialised sales\nrepresentatives, who can effectively commercialise and explain offerings to\nbusiness or government, will fit into the 2020 business landscape.\n\nA particular need is also seen in industries as varied as energy and media,\nentertainment and information for a new type of senior manager.\n\nThe dataset that forms the basis of the report is the result of an extensive\nsurvey of CHROs and other senior talent and strategy executives from a total\nof 371 leading global employers, representing more than 13 million employees\nacross nine broad industry sectors in 15 major developed and emerging\neconomies and regional economic areas.\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

Global intellectual property\nconsultancy ClearViewIP and human resources and reward specialist Stitch\nCommunications have been picked up as the Big Four firm continues a global\nacquisition campaign on multiple fronts._\n\nGlobal professional services leader Deloitte has committed to a number of\nacquisitions across its international operations in 2019. In January, Deloitte\n[acquired CloudinIT](https://www.consultancy.com.au/news/642/deloitte-digital-\nbuys-new-zealand-based-consultancy-cloudinit), a New Zealand-based IT\nconsultancy specialised in Salesforce and Amazon cloud services, then in\nMarch, the firm boosted its cyber analytics capabilities through the\nacquisition of boutique Sydney-based risk [consultancy Converging Data\nAustralia](https://www.consultancy.asia/news/2069/deloitte-and-kpmg-make-risk-\nand-insolvency-acquisitions-in-australia). In May, the Big Four followed that\nup with the [purchase of\nPervorm](https://www.consultancy.eu/news/2703/deloitte-digital-picks-up-dutch-\nmarketing-agency-pervorm), an online marketing agency specialised in digital\nmarketing and digital transformation services in the Netherlands.\n\nNow, the firm has continued its global strengthening with the capture of two\nfirms in the UK. The two deals see ClearViewIP, a global intellectual property\n(IP) consulting and transaction advisory business, become part of the\n[Deloitte](/firms/deloitte \"Deloitte\") network alongside human capital\nspecialist Stitch Communications.\n\n![Deloitte acquisitions expand specialist IP and HR\nservices](/illustrations/news/detail/2019-06-11-140624090-Deloitte-\nacquisitions-expand-specialist-IP-and-HR-services.jpg)\n\nFounded in 2007, ClearViewIP works to help clients exploit IP more\neffectively, leveraging a team of chief IP officers, business builders,\nlicensing executives and technologists, many of whom have worked with\nmultinational FTSE 350 and Fortune 100 companies, as well as SMEs and academic\ninstitutions. Founder and CEO, Jon Calvert, now becomes a Deloitte Partner and\nwill continue to lead the team, operating under the Deloitte IP advisory\nservices division.\n\nCalvert said of the news, \"We are excited to join Deloitte as it accelerates\nour ability to support a broader client base and enhances Deloitte's mission\nof providing a wide range of value creation services.\"\n\nRemarking on the deal, Andrew Robinson, leader of Deloitte's specialist\nvaluation group, said, \"It has long been recognised that managing IP is vital\nin enabling businesses to deliver their commercial objectives and create long-\nterm value. However, the strategy and management side is rapidly growing in\nimportance. This move enables us to offer our clients enhanced ways of\nsafeguarding and commercialising their innovation and IP investment.\"\n\nStitch Communications is an internal communications agency, specialising in\ncreating pay and reward communications that help employers to better engage\ntheir staff. The company was founded in 2011, and its Bristol-based team has\nnow officially joined Deloitte to help build the firm's current offerings for\nHR programmes, such as reward and benefit strategies.\n\nMitul Shah, Partner and Reward Leader at Deloitte, said, \"Our decision to\ninvite the Stitch Communications team to join Deloitte was about enhancing the\nservices we can provide to clients by having industry leading communication\nexperts who specialise in making the complicated clear. Bringing the team on\nboard will further elevate the service we provide our clients in designing,\nimplementing, managing and communicating HR and reward programmes.\"\n\nEmma Dawson, Managing Director of Stitch Communications, added, \"This is an\nincredibly exciting moment for Stitch. We've always known a bold and engaging\ncommunications strategy is vital if businesses want to truly connect with\ntheir employees. Being part of such a recognised and trusted team as\nDeloitte's Global Employer Services will enable us to enhance our\ncommunications offering further than ever before. We can't wait to see what\nthe future holds for Stitch as a Deloitte business.\"\n\n  * [ __](mailto:?&subject=Deloitte acquisitions expand specialist IP and HR services&body=https://www.consultancy.uk/news/21587/deloitte-acquisitions-expand-specialist-ip-and-hr-services)\n  * [ __  \n](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.consultancy.uk/news/21587/deloitte-\nacquisitions-expand-specialist-ip-and-hr-\nservices&title=Deloitte+acquisitions+expand+specialist+IP+and+HR+services&source=https://www.consultancy.uk/news/21587/deloitte-\nacquisitions-expand-specialist-ip-and-hr-services)\n\n  * [ __  \n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Deloitte+acquisitions+expand+specialist+IP+and+HR+services&url=https://www.consultancy.uk/news/21587/deloitte-\nacquisitions-expand-specialist-ip-and-hr-services&via=Consultancy_uk)\n\n  * [ __  \n](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.consultancy.uk/news/21587/deloitte-\nacquisitions-expand-specialist-ip-and-hr-services)\n\n  * [ __  \n](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=https://www.consultancy.uk/news/21587/deloitte-\nacquisitions-expand-specialist-ip-and-hr-services)\n\n  \n\n## Latest news\n\n  * [Film and TV sector adds billions to UK economy](/news/24316/film-and-tv-sector-adds-billions-to-uk-economy)\n  * [M&A; in consulting: Why buying change complements digital](/news/24310/ma-in-consulting-why-buying-change-complements-digital)\n  * [Quantuma grows North West presence with Bell Advisory deal](/news/24313/quantuma-grows-north-west-presence-with-bell-advisory-deal)\n  * [Debenhams appoints administrators for second time in a year](/news/24307/debenhams-appoints-administrators-for-second-time-in-a-year)\n  * [Lancia appoints Simon Williams and Nic Norman-Smith](/news/24304/lancia-appoints-simon-williams-and-nic-norman-smith)\n\n### Subscribe to our newsletter.\n\nSubscribe\n\nSubscription successful\n\n#### Filter\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   * Research\n\n### Profile\n\n  * [Deloitte](/firms/deloitte)\n\n### More news on\n\n  * [M&A; in consulting](/news/consulting/ma-in-consulting)\n\n[\u00d7](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Close\")\n\nSelect a country\n\n[ United Kingdom ](/news/country/united-kingdom)\n\n[\u00d7](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Close\")\n\nSelect a company\n\n[ Alvarez & Marsal ](/news/firm/alvarez-marsal) [ Analysys Mason\n](/news/firm/analysys-mason) [ Arthur D.

weighs in on how the\nsuccessful startup has grown its talent base in a competitive market.\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | February 22, 2019\n\nTopics: [Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) | [Learning\nand Development](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/learning-development/) |\n[Recruitment](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/recruitment/) | [Talent\nManagement](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/talentmanagement/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Shopee_TechBoot.jpg)\n\n\n\n**About the Author**  \n---  \n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/02/LimTeckYong_Shopee.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/02/LimTeckYong_Shopee.png)Lim Teck Yong is the Head of\nRegional Operations and People Team at Shopee.  \n  \nThe shortage of talent is not a new challenge for employers in Singapore and\nthe region.\n\nIt has been an issue across industries for several years now especially in\nfilling up positions that require specialised experience and skills in\napplicants.\n\nNew technologies are fast expanding, however, they are redefining rather than\nreplacing in-demand roles.\n\nRecruiting talents like data scientists, analysts, engineers, designers,\nmarketers has also become tougher as Southeast Asia becomes a hotspot for many\ne-commerce and start-up ventures.\n\n****[Shopee](https://shopee.sg/) began as a start-up in 2015 from a team of 10\nin Singapore to around 700 this year. This growth did not come without any\nbumps on the road.\n\nOver the years, we have been able to fill the positions and scale the teams to\ndeliver what the company has to accomplish.\n\nHowever, as industries progress, the battle for talent will continue \u2013 which\nbrings to question of how we can keep our existing ones, while also attracting\nnew blood.\n\n****\n\n## **Growing our existing talent base**\n\nWe have taken an aggressive recruiting stance from the beginning as we were\ncompeting against much more established companies.\n\nStarting with a very young workforce proved to be a challenge and an\nopportunity. It was a challenge because there were not many people experienced\nwith e-commerce or m-commerce.\n\nBut it was also an opportunity because we were able to identify the necessary\ntraining the company needed to grow fast.\n\nBuilding Shopee\u2019s learning and development programme has allowed us to bring\nin a fresh talent pool and train them to become a relevant foundation of the\nbusiness.\n\nInitiatives such as detailed onboarding programmes, structured training\nroadmaps, career development, and internal and external courses, are put\ntogether based on each employee's job scope and level.\n\nThis allows them to understand the entire organisation and the relevance of\ntheir role within the ecosystem.\n\nAdditionally, employees can sign up for a 3-month mentorship program, which\nallows them to receive guidance and direction from more experienced colleagues\nin the company.\n\n****\n\n## **Creating a gateway to a career within the company**\n\nOrganisations can expand the talent pool by opening up gateways for\nprofessionals and students to join their business.\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/02/Shopee_TechBoot3.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/02/Shopee_TechBoot3.jpg)\n\n_**Students from National University of Singapore attending a lecture on Data\nAnalytics at Shopee Boot Camp, led by a Shopee employee**_\n\nThis can be done through free workshops providing advanced learning\nopportunities for existing employees or holding competitions to spark interest\nin specific roles.\n\nThese can be leveraged to identify and reward potential talents with full-time\nor internship opportunities within the company.\n\nAs part of the Singapore government\u2019s Smart Nation campaign to equip students\nwith essential technical skills and expertise to prepare them for the digital\nand data-driven economy, we see companies across various industries working\nwith educational institutions to drive this initiative.\n\nShopee, for example, will be organising the upcoming [National Data Science\nChallenge 2019](https://careers.shopee.sg/ndsc/), which is the largest data\nscience competition in Singapore.\n\nEarlier this year, we also\n[partnered](https://www.sirsdigitalcommerce.com/for-shopee-sellers.html) with\nNanyang Polytechnic\u2019s Singapore Institute of Retail Studies (SIRS) to offer\ne-commerce workshops.\n\nOur objective was to empower the participants with the essential knowledge in\nsetting up their business online.\n\nOther activities that are being explored include complimentary workshops for\nstudents with a revolving focus on data science, data engineering, and data\nanalytics through the [Shopee Tech\nBootcamp](https://careers.shopee.sg/recruitment-event/).\n\nWe have also opened our office to students from National University of\nSingapore for full-day sessions with exercises led by experienced speakers\nfrom the team.\n\nThrough these activities, students are introduced to various data platforms\nand tools during the hands-on lab session.\n\nhrmasia.com\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/02/ShopeeTechBoot2.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/02/ShopeeTechBoot2.jpg)\n\n_**Students from National University of Singapore at a hands-on lab session at\nShopee 's headquarters**_\n\nhrmasia.com\n\n## **Empowering more females to take interest and pursue a career in STEM**\n\nThe demand for talents is expected to grow as we move towards becoming a Smart\nNation, especially in the fields of science, technology, engineering and\nmathematics (STEM).\n\nHowever, while female employment rate in Singapore ranks high globally, the\nnumber of women in the science and technology sector has stagnated over the\ndecade.\n\nEstablishing initiatives to encourage women in technology is something that\nShopee is supporting. We acknowledge the importance of building a strong core\nfor this growth sector and furthering diversity in the workplace.\n\nHaving a platform for female technology leaders to come together to share\ntheir knowledge and network creates opportunities for women from all walks of\nlife to get in touch with the tech community.\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/02/Shopee_CodingGirls.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/02/Shopee_CodingGirls.jpg)\n\n_**Coding Girls: Du Juan, Product and User Behavior Analytics Lead, Shopee, at\na panel discussion to empower more girls to code and achieve their ambitions\nin the technology world**_\n\nFor example, Shopee collaborated with [Coding\nGirls](https://www.facebook.com/CodingGirls/), a locally-registered non-profit\norganization to empower more girls to code and achieve their ambitions in the\ntechnology world, and to establish an avenue for future professionals to\nconnect with women leaders and to learn from their experiences and\nperspectives.\n\nAs technology develops, industries will grow \u2013 therefore, there is no end in\nsight in the search for talent. Identifying someone who is a good fit or the\nright fit for your company is not an easy task.\n\nIt\u2019s not just pressing a buzzer after a performance showcase. The search for\ntalents is a rigorous process of sieving through potentials to recruit like-\nminded people whose values are in line with our company\u2019s.\n\nAs part of a fast-growing industry like e-commerce, our challenge will always\nbe keeping up with the demands of the industry.\n\nWith this in mind, we must ensure that our teams are armed and ready to\nsupport the business through continual reviewing and assessment to understand\nour changing needs.\n\n\n\n_**Further Reading:**_\n\n[More women needed in science, technology sectors: Josephine\nTeo](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-women-needed-in-\nscience-technology-sectors-josephine-teo-9861416)\n\n[Encouraging female perspectives in traditionally male-dominated\nfields](http://hrmasia.com/encouraging-female-perspectives-in-traditionally-\nmale-dominated-fields/)\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Ftalent-\nsearch-shopee%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Talent+search+isn%E2%80%99t+as+easy+as+pressing+a+buzzer&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Ftalent-\nsearch-shopee%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Ftalent-\nsearch-shopee%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

[Professional Services Industry Transformation\nMap](https://www.gov.sg/~/sgpcmedia/media_releases/edb/press_release/P-20180123-1/attachment/Updated-\nPress%20Release%20-%20Professional%20Svcs%20ITM-24Jan2018.pdf) (ITM _[1]_ )\nwas [launched\n](https://www.gov.sg/resources/sgpc/media_releases/edb/press_release/P-20180123-1)today,\ncharting a roadmap to develop the industry to become a global market leader in\nhigh-value, specialist services, driven by innovation and partnerships, over a\nfive- to ten-year horizon.\n\nProfessional Services firms in sectors such as Architecture and Engineering\nServices, Consulting, Accounting, Legal and Advertising. Professional\nServices, which employed more than 230,000 people, made up 6.5% of Singapore\u2019s\nGDP and contributed around $25 billion in value-add in 2016.\n\nThrough the ITM, the sector is projected to post an average growth rate of\n4.6% from 2015 to reach a value-add of S$31 billion by 2020 and generate 5,500\nnew Professional, Managers, Executives and Technicians (PMET) jobs every year\nduring the same period.\n\nThe ITM is an inter-agency effort led by the Economic Development Board\n([EDB](https://www.edb.gov.sg/)), alongside agencies including Building\nConstruction Authority ([BCA](https://www.bca.gov.sg/)), [IE\nSingapore](https://www.iesingapore.gov.sg/), Infocomm Media Development\nAuthority ([IMDA](https://www.imda.gov.sg/)), [Ministry of\nLaw](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/minlaw/en.html), Singapore Accountancy\nCommission ([SAC](https://www.sac.gov.sg/)), [SPRING\nSingapore](https://www.spring.gov.sg/Pages/Home.aspx), SkillsFuture Singapore\n(SSG) and Workforce Singapore ([WSG](http://www.wsg.gov.sg/)), as well as\nindustry partners, trade associations and professional bodies.\n\nKey initiatives in the ITM aim to drive innovation in the industry and to\nequip Singapore\u2019s workforce with specialised skillsets in high-growth areas\nsuch as data science, analytics and artificial intelligence.\n\nSimilar to the other sectoral ITMs, partnerships are viewed as critical to the\ngrowth and transformation of the services industry and hence, the Government\nwill work closely with key partners such as industry associations and\nprofessional bodies, as well as the unions.\n\nLaunching the ITM at the opening of Dentsu Aegis Network\u2019s Asia Pacific\nHeadquarters in Singapore, Ms. Indranee Rajah, Senior Minister of State,\nMinistry of Law & Ministry of Finance and Co-Chair for the Future Economy\nCouncil (FEC) Modern Services Sub-Committee, said, \u201cThe Professional Services\nsector is a growing industry with tremendous potential for job creation.\nSingapore has the right conditions for companies to innovate world-class\nbusiness solutions and forge cross-disciplinary partnerships. The ITM is an\nintegrated plan that will enable our firms to scale, innovate and increase\ntheir productivity, while preparing Singaporeans to take on exciting new jobs\nsuch as digital product developers, data modellers and risk advisory\nprofessionals.\u201d\n\n**Growth areas**\n\nCompanies in advertising, consulting and engineering services are looking to\nbuild key digital capabilities in data science, analytics and artificial\nintelligence. There are also significant opportunities for strategy and\noperations consulting as clients embark on digital transformation projects. In\naddition, the steady growth of engineering and infrastructure projects, and\nfinancial services is expected to increase demand for specialised services\nsuch as project management, risk management, business valuation and dispute\nresolution.\n\nTo harness opportunities in high-growth areas, continuous building of\ninnovation capabilities by firms and individuals is essential. Innovation in\nProfessional Services involves delivering services and solutions through\ndifferent business models to be more effective and cost-efficient, and\ncontinual investment into technology. This is accelerating in Singapore.\n\nFor example, home-grown accounting firm Precursor Group has diversified from\ntraditional audit services to also offering HR and analytics services, through\nits proprietary cloud-based services delivery platform. This has allowed them\nto scale their offerings to over 500 local and multinational clients with just\n60 staff.\n\nWongPartnership, a leading full service Singapore law practice, adopted AI\ntool, Luminance, to enhance its due diligence processes for Merger &\nAcquisition transactions. The firm is harnessing the predictive power of AI to\ndiscern patterns and detect anomalies across large volumes of contracts and\nunstructured data.\n\nInnovation is also about continuously building differentiated competencies. In\nthis regard, global firms have been establishing leading Centres of Excellence\n(COEs) in Singapore, to serve global and regional markets. Recent examples\ninclude Dentsu Aegis Network\u2019s Global Data Innovation Centre, McKinsey\u2019s\nDigital Capability Centre, Deloitte\u2019s Future of Work COE, Booz Allen\nHamilton\u2019s Singapore Cyber Security Solutions Center and Mott MacDonald\u2019s\nAdvanced Building Information Modelling Technologies COE.\n\nThe Government will also play an active role in facilitating collaborations\nthrough convening innovation platforms, bringing together companies, start-ups\nand research institutes to work on common challenges and co-create solutions.\n\nSuch innovation platforms include setting up living labs where companies can\ncollaborate to test-bed and commercialise solutions in a live environment. An\nexample is the HDB\u2019s Smart Urban Habitat Masterplan\n([SUHMP](http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/press-releases/hdb-inks-three-new-\nagreements-with-industry-partners-11072016)) which focuses on the usage of\ndigital technologies to improve liveability in public housing. The\nimplementation of SUHMP has created opportunities for NCS, Arup, AECOM and\nother engineering consultants to identify and recommend smart initiatives for\ndeployment.\n\nAnother innovation platform that will be created is a data-sharing consortium.\n\nThis will see leading firms such as Google, Grab and Adobe collaborating to\nhelp businesses with smarter data use to drive marketing innovation. According\nto the press release, more details will be made available in the coming weeks.\n\n**Skill development**\n\nThe high-growth areas in Professional Services have spawned many new jobs\nwhich did not exist until the last few years. Existing professionals and new\nentrants can expect comprehensive support from the ITM.\n\nAs part of the ITM, the Government will work with firms and industry players\nto re-design jobs, and actively upskill and reskill their workforce for high-\ngrowth areas.\n\nUnder the Adapt and Grow initiative, Workforce Singapore (WSG) has launched\nmore than 10 Professional Conversion Programmes\n([PCPs](http://www.wsg.gov.sg/programmes-and-initiatives/professional-\nconversion-programmes.html)) relevant to Professional Services. PMETs are\ntrained to take on roles ranging from global infrastructure projects, digital\nadvertising to HR management.\n\nFour new PCPs for Programmatic Advertising, Internal Audit, User Experience\n(UX) and User Interface (UI) and Building Information Modelling are under\ndevelopment.\n\nSkills Frameworks and related accreditations will be developed for relevant\nsub-sectors to support professionals in better understanding the range of\ncareer pathways, skills requirements and available training programmes. This\nfollows the Skills Framework for Accountancy launched in October 2017, which\nidentified emerging skillsets such as data analytics, valuation research and\nanalysis. The skillsets were mapped to 6 career tracks and 25 job roles.\n\nIn addition, Institutes of Higher Learning are strengthening work-learn\ncollaborations with firms in Professional Services to ensure greater industry\nrelevance of training programmes. SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programmes\n([ELPs](http://www.skillsfuture.sg/earnandlearn)) have been launched for\nAccountancy, Visual Communications, UX Design and Management, and Branding and\nDigital Marketing. To-date, SSG has enrolled over 130 ELP participants into\ncompanies such as PwC, Deloitte and BBDO. Future ELPs under development\ninclude more specialisations such as UX and Accountancy.\n\nBeyond the ELPs, advertising agencies such as DDB are also working with\nInstitutes of Higher Learning to groom next-generation talent. DDB\u2019s COE in\nTemasek Polytechnic, \u201c[Equator](http://www.tp.edu.sg/about-tp/media-\ncentre/news/ddb-equator-satellite-office-launch-)\u201d, trains 20 students per\nsemester across faculties through academic programmes and hands-on experience\nwith client projects, working together with DDB\u2019s senior leadership team.\n\n**Support for internationalisation and productivity enhancement**\n\nInitiatives will be put in place to enhance Singapore\u2019s global market position\nand grow exports of services to regional and global markets. An example is the\n[Tech Start for Law](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/minlaw/en/news/press-\nreleases/launch-of--2-8m-tech-start-programme-to-help-singapore-law-\npract.html) programme to help Singapore law firms adopt productivity tools.\n\nSPRING Singapore (SPRING) and IE Singapore _[2]_ , together with the rest of\nthe Government, will strengthen efforts to work with businesses with the\nambition and ability to scale. This aims to grow more firms such as Allen &\nGledhill, Rajah & Tann, TSLA, Surbana Jurong and Meinhardt, which have set up\nbusiness operations covering ASEAN, China, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nIn addition, more market- and sector-specific lead generation and profiling\nplatforms will be developed, such as the annual Asia-Singapore Infrastructure\nRoundtable to bring together infrastructure players in the region to discuss\nproject opportunities. SPRING and IE Singapore will continue to work with\nindustry players to promote overseas business opportunities for home-grown\nfirms via overseas business missions and events.\n\n_[1][Roadmaps](https://www.mti.gov.sg/MTIInsights/Pages/ITM.aspx) are being\ndeveloped for 23 industries to address issues within each industry and deepen\npartnerships between Government, firms, industries, trade associations and\nchambers. The ITMs are grouped into 6 broad cluster: Manufacturing, Built\nenvironment, Trade & connectivity, Essential Domestic Services, Modern\nservices and Lifestyle. Most of the ITMs have been released._\n\n_[2] SPRING Singapore and IE Singapore are

When I ask my students at the Singapore Management University (SMU)\nwhere they would like to work after graduation, few will name SMEs as their\npreferred choice.\n\nThe disparity in workforce quality between the two groups of companies\ntranslates eventually into marketplace outcome differences.\n\n**Raising productivity for SMEs**  \nGovernment bodies have long stressed the need for companies to increase their\nproductivity. This was reiterated by Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say in his May\nDay message this year when he said, \"Manpower could become a bottleneck of our\nfuture growth unless we speed up efforts to become a more manpower-lean\neconomy and a more productive workforce.\"\n\nWorkforce productivity refers to the efficiency of workers in an organisation.\nThe government had taken huge steps to spearhead productivity growth in\nSingapore.\n\nSPRING Singapore was set up for this purpose. It was formerly known as the\nProductivity and Standards Board (PSB) and was formed through a merger of the\nNational Productivity Board (NPB) and the Singapore Institute of Standards and\nIndustrial Research (SISIR). Its initiatives appear to bear fruit, with many\ncompanies today placing more emphasis on training, innovation, and other HR\ninitiatives to fuel their productivity growth.\n\nThe quest for productivity improvement has led some experts to suggest the use\nof HR analytics to better manage their workforce. They point to the weakness\nof the age-old practice of using gut-feel approaches for workforce management\nand provide support for the more objective HR analytics approach in HR\nmanagement. HR analytics optimises human capital use in the company, leading\nto better business outcomes.\n\nToday, HR analytics is regarded as the next big thing in workforce management.\nCompanies use it for recruiting, retaining, and motivating employees. However,\nthe degree of enthusiasm in its adoption among SMEs seems muted.\n\nIf SMEs do not match their MNC counterparts in enhancing the value of their\nworkforce, they risk lagging further in their competitiveness. SMEs should be\nmore open to such transformative HR practices.\n\n**The use of Human Resources analytics**  \nThe Society of Human Resources Management (SHRM) defines HR analytics as the\nprocess by which the value of an organisation's people is measured and\nimproved for the purpose of enhancing organisational performance. Companies\nhave employed its use in myriad ways.\n\nJetBlue compares employee engagement at various branches and intervenes in\nthose that are underperforming.\n\nHarrah's identifies the characteristics of high performers in various job\nfunctions and subsequently matches 'right' employees to 'right' jobs to\nimprove performance outcomes. Additionally, it also evaluates the effects of\nits health and wellness programmes on employee engagement and bottom line.\n\nStarbucks examines the impact of HR initiatives on other business outcomes\nthat include the value of its customers. The company then predicts the returns\nfrom these initiatives and implements those with the greatest impact.\n\nAT&T employs HR analytics extensively in recruitment and finds that the\nability of staff to take initiative is more important to business outcomes\nthan academic achievements.\n\nIn Singapore, Nation Employment adopts HR analytics as part of its growth\nstrategy. The SME is a leading foreign domestic worker employment agency\noffering placement services for workers.\n\nIn its quest to enhance its human capital, it identified organisational\nfactors that have significant effects on staff performance and, subsequently,\nfocused on those whose effects are the greatest. It also identified factors\nthat were important to prospective employees.\n\n**The real issue**  \nAs academics, consultants, and seminar speakers, we interact often with senior\nlevel management staff of various SMEs. We find a key reason for the slow\nadoption of HR analytics among this group lies in not knowing how they can\nleverage on this approach.\n\nMaterials on HR analytics applications are widely available. There is also no\nshortage of HR analytics programmes today. Singapore Management University\noffers a human capital analytics module through its structured human capital\nmaster programme for those interested in a more formal route and a two-day HR\nanalytics workshop through its continuing professional education arm.\n\n**Expertise for analytics**  \nSome companies perceive HR analytics to be an expensive undertaking, pointing\nto the need for a highly specialised HR analytics group to be assembled.\nHowever, there are better value options available to companies. They can work\nwith external specialised HR analytics firms.\n\nThe complexities of analytical methods vary depending on the desired insights\nto be obtained. Specialised HR analytics firms are usually staffed with\nsophisticated analytical professionals who have deep knowledge of the various\nanalytical methods and can also offer useful recommendations to their clients.\nThe availability of analytical expertise in these partner firms removes\nanalytical constraints and, hence, allow for more useful insights to be\nobtained.\n\nAnother benefit of this approach is the opportunity to learn more about the\napplications of HR analytics from these partners and, over time, extend its\nuse in the organisation. This approach was taken by the SME, Nation\nEmployment, in its foray into HR analytics.\n\n**Take the first step**  \nSMEs need to become more competitive. As a first step towards this end, they\nneed to attract good workers and maximise the value of their human capital. HR\nanalytics offers them this opportunity. They can begin with smaller HR\nanalytics projects and then move on to bigger ones as they gain more\nconfidence over time. But they must take the first step soon!\n\n**_The views expressed in this column are the author 's own and do not\nnecessarily reflect this publication's view, and this article is not edited by\nSingapore Business Review.

Business\n\n[Business\nIntelligence](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/insights/business-\nintelligence/) [Latest News](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/latest-\nnews/) [Machine Learning](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/machine-\nlearning/)\n\nby [Vivek Kumar](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/ \"Posts by\nVivek Kumar\") [September 3, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/09/)\n[0 comments](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/oyo-acquires-danamica-bolster-\nvacation-homes-business/#comments)\n\n![](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Oyo-1.jpg)\n\nOyo Hotels & Homes, a rental hotel network, acquired\n[Danamica](https://www.danamica.dk/), a Copenhagen-based data science venture,\nwith machine learning and business intelligence capabilities, specialised in\ndynamic pricing. This acquisition is in proportion to OYO\u2019s continued\ncommitment to its global vacation rentals business through strategic\ninvestments in technology products, processes, and people.\n\nFurthermore, this acquisition comes a month after OYO committed to investing\naround \u20ac300 million (US$328.94 million) in the vacation homes business in\nEurope, with focus on bolstering the relationship with homeowners and allowing\nthem with the resources, such as technology investments, required to deliver\nelegant hospitality experiences.\n\nThe acquisition of Danamica will provide OYO the opportunities to drive top-\nline growth by leveraging its dynamic pricing across all of its brands,\nincluding OYO Home, Belvilla and DanCenter, these all are already at the\nforefront of vacation rental pricing in Europe. Also, the company and its real\nestate partners worldwide will benefit by utilizing data sciences for improved\nyield. Beginning with Europe, Danamica\u2019s technology innovations will offer the\nadvantage to OYO\u2019s global vacation homes business.\n\nAccording to the reports, the deployment of machine learning-powered pricing\nand revenue management offer customers to book a vacation home at the best\nprice. OYO\u2019s pricing, inventory allocation, and revenue management are driven\nby an ML-based algorithm for prediction and dynamic pricing.\n\nThough the terms of the acquisition were not unveiled, Oyo stated in a\nstatement that the acquisition of Danamica that has machine learning and\nbusiness intelligence capabilities with specialisation in dynamic pricing will\nbe leveraged across its vacation rental brands.\n\nOn this Danamica acquisition, Global Head of OYO Vacation and Urban Homes and\nChief Strategy Officer of OYO Hotels & Homes, Maninder Gulati said, \u201cThe\nacquisition of Danamica will help us be more accurate with pricing, leading to\nhigher efficiencies and yield for our real estate owners and value for money\nfor our millions of global guests, both everyday travellers and city dwellers,\nthat choose an OYO Vacation Homes as their abode.\u201d\n\nOn the other side, Danamica founders Mads Westberg and Rune Larsen pointed out\nthat OYO and Danamica have a shared understanding of the importance and impact\nof AI and data science. Like OYO, Danamica recognises the untapped potential\nin the vacation rental industry that can be fulfilled with a data-driven\napproach.\n\nMuch similar to airlines, and ride-hailing companies, OYO now introduced\ndynamic pricing in the hospitality industry to build a level-playing ground\neven for the independent or small hoteliers or homeowners. The latest\nacquisition also comes about four months after when OYO announced its\nacquisition of Amsterdam-based vacation rental company @Leisure from German\nmedia group Axel Springer for a reported \u20ac370 million, which was later\nrebranded Oyo Vacation Homes.\n\n## Share This Article\n\nDo the sharing thingy\n\n[\n__](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/oyo-\nacquires-danamica-bolster-vacation-homes-business/) __ [\n__](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/oyo-\nacquires-danamica-bolster-vacation-homes-business/) [\n__](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/oyo-\nacquires-danamica-bolster-vacation-homes-business/&title=OYO Acquires Danamica\nto Bolster Its Vacation Homes Business) [\n__](http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/oyo-\nacquires-danamica-bolster-vacation-homes-\nbusiness/&media=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/Oyo-1.jpg&description=OYO Acquires Danamica to Bolster\nIts Vacation Homes Business)\n\n## About Author\n\nMore info about author\n\n[ ![Vivek\nKumar](//www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c59463ef7ad349924783ff338f26e9e?s=130&r=g&d=mm)\n](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/)\n\n###  [Vivek Kumar](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/)\n\n[More by Vivek Kumar __](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/)\n\n## Related Latest News Articles\n\nSimilar Posts From Latest News Category\n\n[ ![Different Ways of How Twitter Uses Artificial\nIntelligence](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/01/Twitter-AI-173x130_c.jpg)\n](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/different-ways-of-how-twitter-uses-\nartificial-intelligence/)\n\n#### [Different Ways of How Twitter Uses Artificial\nIntelligence](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/different-ways-of-how-twitter-\nuses-artificial-intelligence/)\n\n[January 29, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/01/)\n\n[ ![Israeli AI Startup Hailo Expands Series A Round to $21\nMillion](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Hailo-\nfounders.-From-left-to-right-CEO-Orr-Danon-Chief-Business-Development-Officer-\nHadar-Zeitlin-and-CTO-Avi-Baum.-Photographer-Eran-Tayree-11-173x130_c.jpg)\n](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/israeli-ai-startup-hailo-expands-series-a-\nround-to-21-million/)\n\n#### [Israeli AI Startup Hailo Expands Series A Round to $21\nMillion](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/israeli-ai-startup-hailo-expands-\nseries-a-round-to-21-million/)\n\n[January 23, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/01/)\n\n[ ![Artificial Intelligence: What Should Worry\nUs?](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/The-Fear-of-\nAI-173x130_c.jpeg) ](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/artificial-intelligence-\nwhat-should-worry-us/)\n\n#### [Artificial Intelligence: What Should Worry\nUs?](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/artificial-intelligence-what-should-\nworry-us/)\n\n[October 10, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/10/)\n\n## No Comments so far\n\nJump into a conversation\n\n### No Comments Yet!\n\nYou can be the one to start a conversation.\n\n###  [Click here to cancel reply.](/oyo-acquires-danamica-bolster-vacation-\nhomes-business/#respond)\n\n__**Your data will be safe!** Your e-mail address will not be published.

This\nincludes data science leaders, data translators, who can provide the link\nbetween the data function and the business, and domain-specialist data\nscientists.\n\nThe separation of different types of data scientists may have occurred because\ncurrent data professionals have found themselves having to cover too much\nground to manage what\u2019s being demanded of them.\n\n\u201cThis can sometimes be a case of trying to master both the technical and the\nbusiness understanding and communication aspects of their role,\u201d says Iain\nBrown, head of data science at SAS UK and Ireland.\n\nSAS carried out research that found more than half of data scientists were\n[reportedly suffering from some level of work-related\nstress](https://www.raconteur.net/business-innovation/stress-work-always-bad)\ndue to such a broad remit.\n\n\u201cThe shift towards sector-specific and less general data scientists is\nprobably one that needed to happen anyway as the role was becoming too\nstretched,\u201d Mr Brown says, adding that some organisations may need to consider\nskill-specific data scientists too.\n\n####  **How necessary is it for data scientists to know their sector?**\n\n![](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/03/FOD_p12_2-e1553530344703.jpg) However, Caroline\nCarruthers, a former data leader at Network Rail and Lowell, says that even in\nthe future, [data scientists won\u2019t necessarily only be hired if they have\ndomain knowledge.](https://www.raconteur.net/risk-management/rise-data-\nscientist-insurance)\n\n\u201cData is still data whether it sits in a retailer or a charity. It\u2019s more\nimportant for employers to find data scientists who are able to harness their\nunending curiosity coupled with a logical and creative mind, and a background\nin making a quantifiable impact on their business,\u201d she says. Mr Hoods adds:\n\u201cDomain experience is useful, but it can be learnt.\u201d\n\nMichelle Wren, human resources director at Freedom Finance, recently had a\nrequirement for a data scientist with a broad skill set encompassing data,\nanalytics and soft skills, without the need for domain expertise.\n\n\u201cA recent hire took five months to recruit, and we found many applicants could\nbe more selective with where and what they settle for,\u201d she says.\n\nThe power, therefore, is still very much with data scientists. But with new\ntechnologies on the horizon, there is a view that the data professionals could\nautomate themselves out of a job.\n\n####  **The future data scientists need to be even more specialised**\n\nMatt Cockbill, head of the IT and digital leadership practice at Berwick\nPartners, isn\u2019t convinced. \u201cIt may have some hint of truth for lower-value\ndata skills, but[ high-value, full-stack data science roles\n](https://www.raconteur.net/business-innovation/data-science-marketing-\nsales)will continue to reform and reshape the world around them, creating\ncontinued heavy demand,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cData scientist is a broad catch-all title. While we will see more specific\ncareer paths evolve, the bubble around data science and data engineering\nskills isn\u2019t set to burst.\u201d\n\nTechnology will give these professionals more capabilities, but it won\u2019t mean\ntheir roles will be made redundant in the years to come. As Ms Carruthers\nsays, it just means the overall level of data literacy will improve across the\nworkforce, with other employees gaining a better understanding of how to use\ndata more widely.\n\n\u201cThe future data scientist can therefore be even more specialised, tackling\nthe most business-critical and complex challenges that will help their\nbusinesses make revolutionary leaps forward,\u201d she concludes.\n\nAlso found in [Data Science](https://www.raconteur.net/tag/data-science)\n[Talent Gap](https://www.raconteur.net/tag/talent-gap)

Reinhart _, Member of the Executive Board, Human Relations and\nDirector of Labour Relations, Sustainability at Continental AG talks to_ Aditi\nSharma Kalra _about implementing strategic workforce planning as a roadmap to\nbusiness sustainability._\n\nWith around 244,000 employees worldwide in 61 countries and markets, Germany-\nbased Continental has specialised in automotive manufacturing since 1871.\nWithin Asia, the company is present in China, Singapore, Japan, Korea, the\nPhilippines, India, Thailand and Malaysia; with more than 1,300 employees in\nSingapore.\n\nIn an exclusive interview during her recent visit to Singapore, **Dr Ariane\nReinhart, Member of the Executive Board, Human Relations and Director of\nLabour Relations, Sustainability, Continental AG** , shares about the\norganisation\u2019s unique strategic workforce planning approach, joined by locally\nbased **Angie Chua, HR Country Head for Singapore, Continental Automotive\nSingapore**.\n\n**_(Note: All responses are by Dr Ariane Reinhart (AR), unless marked AC for\nAngie Chua\u2019s response)_**\n\n### Q What does HR mean to Continental?\n\nFor us, HR stands for human relations, not human resources, because we believe\nit is more about building and managing relationships. As HR professionals, we\nbelieve in being at eye level with the business. We are not just there as a\nsupport service, but as a support partner. We know the people, the\norganisation and how to develop them.\n\nBeing at eye level with the business also means having self-understanding to\nbe involved very early in the product process. For inventions and new\nproducts, we get involved early on and ask questions about the future skills.\nThis is like the holy grail \u2013 if you know how to identify skills that you will\nneed in the next five years, it\u2019s a real competitive advantage.\n\nIn the past few years, we have developed our two strategic pillars in HR \u2013\none, industrialised best fit; and two, enable transformation. If someone was\nto ask you, what is the biggest value-add that HR can bring to an organisation\n\u2013 industrialised best fit comes in here, that is, to have the right people at\nthe right place with the right skills at the right time and the right\nquantity. If this is not the main added-value or driver of an organisation, it\nwill not be successful.\n\nSecond, to enable transformation, you need to know what you need to do. So we\nasked ourselves four years ago, how many people we will need to recruit in the\nnext few years. For this, the quality of the HR data is the backbone. Only\nonce you have the data right, can you start with strategic workforce planning\n(SWP). If you were to ask companies, how many people they need and in which\nquality, most of them would not have the right answer. But we have been doing\nthis for two-and-a-half years.\n\nWe are running the third round of SWP this year. We have 99% of our workforce\nin all the countries involved, making us one of the few companies who have a\nGPS for our HR measures of how many people we will need. We have a heatmap for\nevery location, division and business unit, saying what kind of people we will\nneed, and even the kind of people we will not need anymore, for example,\nupskilling the workforce affected by automation and digitalisation.\n\n### Q How did you get your own HR team to develop the skills to carry out this\nexercise?\n\nThe first thing is to have good knowledge about the business. We encourage\ncross-movers, we participate in the R&D round table, we ask questions of our\nexpert colleagues on the impact the product might have. We also ensure it is\nthe employee\u2019s responsibility to secure their employability, not just of their\nmanager and of the business. It is about developing a mindset of lifelong\nlearning.\n\n**AC:** In Singapore, the HRBPs are very involved in the business because that\nis key for them to be successful. They need to know the business they are\nsupporting, and from there we talk about their involvement in strategic\nbusiness projects which could be non-HR related.\n\nBusiness acumen is the number one thing our HRBPs need to have. We cannot just\nbe running day-to-day HR operations, we need to be trusted strategic partners.\n\n**AR:** We also say we are trusted irritators. Because we ask questions which\nare, sometimes, not very comfortable. It is part of our job to get people out\nof their comfort zone in order to stretch and transform the organisation.\n\n> ##### As HR professionals, we believe in being at eye level with the\n> business.\n\n###### _- Dr Ariane Reinhart_\n\n### Q You mentioned SWP was launched two-and-a-half years ago. How did you get\nthe buy-in, time and resources from the rest of the business to embark on this\njourney?\n\nWhen you have strategic initiatives from the HR side, you need to partner up.\nI had a chat with one of my board colleagues and told him the idea of resource\nmanagement in a company had been haunting me. He agreed, saying that when we\ngo to customers, they always ask if we have the right and enough people to do\nthe project \u2013 thus, resource management is a key competitive advantage. So I\ndecided to do an experiment in one business unit (BU) regarding SWP, with the\nsupport of the BU head. From there, it was an iterative process. We kept fine-\ntuning it along the way, and getting feedback from the business on whether it\nwas really valuable.\n\n### Q How long did this experiment take?\n\nThis is the magic of Continental. We did an experiment, people were convinced,\nand then we rolled it out in half a year. After 12 months, we had the whole\ncompany worldwide signed up to this. Now that we are in the third year, it is\nnot a strategic project anymore, it is part of our operations.\n\n### Q Rolling it out across the world, what was your experience tailoring it\nto the different geographies?\n\nWhen you do something of this magnitude, you need to have a really good\ncommunication and engagement campaign. It is part of our culture to run\nbottom-up communication. We have an internal social media channel called\nConNext. It has a large number of communities while every board member has a\nblog. We use this platform a lot to involve our people.\n\nWe are a value-based company with four key values: trust, for one another,\nfreedom to act, and passion to win. And if you combine these four unique\nvalues, you really get big things done in a short time frame.\n\n### Q How do you ensure that everyone across Continental is on the same page\nwith these values?\n\nThis was an initiative started by our CEO Elmar Degenhart in 2009 when he took\nover. He is a very values-driven person with a high level of integrity. For\nhim, two or three pieces were really important. First, you have to lead by\nexample from the top, starting with the CEO and the executive board.\n\nSecond, you have to have a good communication campaign that communicates the\nmessage creatively.\n\nAnd third, every year we run a \u2018BASICS live\u2019 survey, where we ask our people\nabout their engagement and how they feel about the values. Every year, we have\ndone incredibly well on the parameters of, \u201cDo people trust each other?\u201d and\n\u201cDo they embrace the values?\u201d, getting over 80% scores even in times of\ntransformation.\n\nOn the other hand, in such a big company, not everybody is leading by example.\nSo we really have to invest more in leadership selection, training and\ncoaching. The leaders have to be aware of why this is so important. Another\nthing to improve in times of transformation is communicating better to\nemployees why we are going in one way over the other.\n\nSometimes, we also need to just celebrate our successes better. As a driven,\nengineered company, we sometimes forget to do that.\n\n### Q Angie, what was your experience in rolling out SWP for the Singapore\noperations?\n\n**AC:** I targeted the three main BUs in Singapore, as a majority of the\nhiring comes from them. For these three BUs, we needed to be farsighted, so I\nengaged them individually, together with the HRBP, rather than having a big\nroll out.\n\nTogether, we planned out the projection of manpower and used the SWP to dive\ndeep into future competencies. From the global side, I was provided the\nstructure and process, and I only had to customise to local needs.\n\n**AR:** One of the key drivers for SWP outside of Western Europe is employee\nretention. Our objective is to be much better than the market. For example, in\nSingapore the market attrition rate for engineers in high tech industries is\n12% to 13%, and we are much below that at about 7% to 8%. Similarly, in China,\nthe average is 14% while we are at 7%.\n\n### Q What are some of the ways that you attract engineers to join\nContinental?\n\nThe most important is the sense of doing \u2013 people seeing that they can make an\nimpact. We don\u2019t just make a claim that your ideas can shape the future; they\ntruly can, particularly in Singapore, with the Smart Nation initiative, low\nemissions, and the affordable connectivity. In addition to making a\ndifference, they need to have a perspective to growth.\n\nFor a company like ours, you can work across more than 50 countries, 25\nbusiness units and four divisions. We are a bit like the United Nations, in\nthat we have over 70 nationalities, while in Singapore itself we have more\nthan 20 nationalities.\n\n![Aditi-April-2019-QA-Continental-Angie-Ng-provided-edited](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/01111350/Aditi-April-2019-QA-Continental-Angie-Ng-\nprovided-edited.jpg)\n\n> ##### We are a bit like the United Nations, in that we have over 70\n> nationalities, while in Singapore itself we have more than 20 nationalities.\n\n###### _- Angie Chua_\n\n### Q This leads us to the employer branding strategy \u2013 what are some of the\ncore elements of it?\n\nSince we focus mainly on software experts, where we are competing with Silicon\nValley majors, it is about our unique selling proposition. On the one hand we\nare very innovative, and on the other, we are very traditional in that we\nprovide security and deep roots \u2013 almost like a 150-year-old start-up!\n\n### Q What helps to maintain that start-up culture?\n\nFirst, it\u2019s all about the values I shared earlier. Second, it\u2019s about the\ndiversity. We don\u2019t have a diversity officer and I do not like the idea of it\nbecause it should be the self-understanding of every leader.\n\nIn Singapore, I\u2019m particularly proud that we have more than 25% of female\nexecutives. But diversity is also about different thoughts, cultural\nbackgrounds, and more. We believe that diversity is a catalyst to innovation.\n\nTo not only attract, but retain people, it\u2019s about the future working\nenvironment, for example, flexibility. We are one of the few big companies in\nthe world to introduce mobile working, part-time working and sabbaticals for\nevery employee \u2013 not only white-collars or engineers, but also those on the\nshop floor.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to have a two-class society. So while the shop-floor employees\ncan\u2019t take a tyre home or produce a part at home, it is a question of building\nthat flexible mindset on the shop floor. For example, through different shift\nbeginnings, job sharing, longer vacations, time accounts, and so on.\n\n### Q You mentioned diversity being a catalyst to innovation, and it so\nhappens that there aren\u2019t enough women engineers and software experts out\nthere. Are you consciously doing anything about it?\n\nWe have a huge engineering hub in Bengaluru, where more than 30% of our\nengineers are women. But then we started losing them at their mid-end 20s,\nwhich is when they were getting married. With the flexibility that Continental\noffers, we were able to let them continue with their career, while carrying\nout their family duties and obligations.\n\nWhen women make up 48% or more of the world\u2019s population, it makes no economic\nsense if you don\u2019t have enough women in the workforce. Best fit means \u201cbest\u201d\nfit independent of any other details \u2013 be it gender, cultural background or\nsexual orientation.\n\nTo find this best fit, we have introduced diagnostic processes such as\npsychometric testing for the white-collar staff. Our vision is that in the\nfuture we don\u2019t look at CVs anymore \u2013 we let people apply, without knowing\ntheir gender or any such consideration \u2013 and we simply let them do the\nintelligence and personality tests. After they pass this step we will look\ninto them in greater detail. This will help ensure equal treatment and\nopportunity for everybody.\n\n### Q Do you set hard targets for the company in terms of diversity?\n\nYes, we have a target worldwide for the top executive level to get to 16% by\n2020. We have to consider that in Germany just 11% of engineering students are\nwomen, so we are very fortunate for such talent in China, India and Singapore.\n\n### Q Coming back to the flexibility policy, you rolled it out globally in\n2016 for all employees. How did you roll it out and ensure there is no misuse\naround it?\n\nWe had a worldwide engagement campaign, asking our people how they would like\nto work and what they aspired towards. Then over a couple of months, we had\nover 700,000 activities just on this topic - be it blogs, videos, and more. It\nwas the most traffic we had over such a short time frame!\n\nOf course, we had to intervene in cases of some leaders who had more of the\nold work concepts on their mind, which is always the case when you have as\nmany employees as a small city. Among the 240,000 there will always be some\nwho might misuse it, but the vast majority will not do it. So we can\u2019t punish\nthe other 99.9%. We are a very compliant organisation and invest a lot in such\ntraining and awareness.\n\n### Q Another thing that you\u2019ve focused on is flat hierarchies. How does a\n150-year-old company start to adopt lean management styles?\n\nWe have a very hands-on, down-to-earth culture. The top management and board\nare always approachable and are close to the people. People are not afraid to\ntalk to them, have a laugh together. Particularly in HR, we are known to work\nhard but also play hard.\n\nWe also have a culture of constructive failure. If you are very innovative,\nthen there are times you will fail - and we encourage people to fail fast and\nfail forward. We give them space to experiment.\n\n### Q What is the way forward on this journey for Continental?\n\nWe are the employer of choice for people who want to make a positive impact on\nsociety, those who follow the vision of a better world with no emissions,\nwhere mobility is affordable, and cities that they are proud to hand over to\ntheir children.\n\nIt might be cool to work for the companies in Silicon Valley, but if they work\nfor a company like ours, which comes with a legacy, traditions, values, no\nhire-and-fire policy, it is a family feeling that gives security to your\nchildren. And finally, we believe we are the employer of choice for women.\n\n### Q Personally, as a HR leader what is the number one skill you want to\nlearn for yourselves?\n\nContinuous learning. I think curiosity is one of the most important\ncharacteristics. Be authentic. Don\u2019t be afraid to stand up and be heard.\n\n* * *\n\n**Read the March edition of Human Resources,

Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\nMinister for Finance, Heng Swee Keat, delivered the Budget speech for the\nFinancial Year 2019 in Parliament yesterday.\n\nAfter reflecting on Singapore's Bicentennial, minister Heng pointed out four\nkey forces reshaping the global environment moving forward:\n\n  * The shift in global economic weight towards Asia.\n  * Rapid technological advancements.\n  * Changing demographic patterns.\n  * A decline in support for globalisation.\n\nIn ASEAN, economic prospects are bright. The 10 economies of ASEAN are\nprojected to become the fourth largest in the world by 2030, with the size of\nthe middle class doubling. This highlights the importance of ASEAN nations\nworking together to can maximise potential.\n\nDomestically, there is a need to address longer-term challenges, including\nageing, social mobility, inequality, economic transformation, and climate\nchange.\n\nThe changing global and domestic landscape presents both challenges and\nopportunities. Hence, to continue to chart the way forward, Budget 2019 is a\nstrategic plan to allocate resources to build a strong, united Singapore.\n\nBudget 2019 will focus on five key things:\n\n  * Keeping Singapore safe and secure.\n  * Continuing to transform the economy\n  * Building a caring and inclusive society\n  * Building Singapore as a global city and home for all, keeping it smart, sustainable, and globally connected.\n  * Achieving these goals in a responsible and fiscally sustainable way.\n\nWith that in mind, here\u2019s a look at the six things, most relevant to manpower\nand HR challenges, that you need to know about Budget 2019.\n\n### #1 Enabling people to have good jobs and opportunities\n\n  * This year, new Professional Conversion Programmes (PCPs) will be launched relating to blockchain, embedded software, and prefabrication to prepare our people to move into new growth areas.\n  * Career Support Programme will be extended by two years to provide wage support for employers to hire eligible Singaporeans who are mature and retrenched, or are in long-term unemployment.\n  * Starting from 1 Apr 2020, all transformation efforts supported by Enterprise Singapore\u2019s Enterprise Development Grant must include positive outcomes for workers, such as wage increases.\n\n### #2 Enhancing complementarities of local and foreign workers\n\n  * Workforce quota will be adjusted for the services sector.\n  * The services sector Dependency Ratio Ceiling (DRC) will be reduced in two steps, from 40% to 38% on 1 January 2020, and to 35% on 1 January 2021.\n  * The services sector S Pass Sub-DRC will also be reduced in two steps, from 15% to 13% on 1 January 2020, and to 10% on 1 January 2021.\n  * To support firms as they adjust to these changes, measures will be in place till FY2022. The 70% funding support level for the Enterprise Development Grant will be extended for three more years, up to 31 March 2023. Productivity Solutions Grant will also be extended till 31 March 2023. It will be enhanced to support up to 70% of the out-of-pocket cost for training, capped at S$10,000.\n  * On a case-by-case basis, firms can bring in foreign workers with specialised skills that are in demand globally. This is provided that they still face a shortage after having given fair consideration to Singaporeans.\n  * Increased Foreign Worker Levy rates for the Marine Shipyard and Process sectors to be deferred for another year as they have only begun showing early signs of recovery.\n\n### #3 Preparing people for Industry 4.0\n\n  * Prepare and develop people to make full use of Singapore\u2019s position as a global node of technology, innovation, and enterprise.\n  * For students who are currently in Institute of Higher Learning (IHLs), the government will combine the local and global internship programmes into a single Global Ready Talent Programme. It will have enhanced funding support for our students interning overseas with Singapore firms.\n  * The Global Ready Talent Programme will also support high-growth Singapore firms to send Singaporeans with up to three years of working experience, for postings in key markets such as Southeast Asia, China, and India.\n  * Singapore Week of Innovation & Technology and Singapore FinTech festival will be held in same week in mid November. This will bring in the global innovation community to come together in Singapore, to explore and collaborate.\n  * The government expects to spend S$4.6 billion over next three years on the new and enhanced capability-building measures in Budget 2019 and to support Singaporean workers. S$3.6 billion will go towards helping workers to thrive amid industry and technological changes. S$1 billion will go towards firms to build deep enterprise capabilities.\n\n### #4 Supporting lower-income workers\n\n  * For bottom 20% of workers, the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) scheme will be enhanced to provide better support.\n  * Qualifying income cap for WIS will be raised from S$2,000 to S$2,300 a month. Maximum annual payouts will be increased by up to S$400. Older workers will see higher increases in payouts.\n  * An estimate of S$206 million a year will be spent on these WIS enhancements.\n\n### #5 Supporting older workers\n\n  * Today, about one in four of Singapore's workforce is aged 55 and above. They continue to make important contributions to our economy and society.\n  * The government is doing more to help them earn more, save more, and have greater peace of mind in their retirement years.\n  * Tripartite Workgroup to study the concerns of older workers will present their recommendations later this year.\n  * The government will extend Special Employment Credit (SEC) and the Additional Special Employment Credit (ASEC) for another year, until 31 December 2020. To support this extension, S$366 million will be added to the SEC Fund.\n\n### #6 Supporting firms and enabling them to scale\n\n  * Enterprise Singapore will launch a Scale-up SG programme in partnership with the private and public sectors. Scale-up SG will work with aspiring, high-growth local firms to identify and build new capabilities, to innovate, grow, and internationalise.\n  * A pilot Innovation Agents programme will be launched for firms to tap on a pool of experts to advise them on opportunities to innovate and commercialise technology.\n  * An additional S$100 million will be set aside to establish SME Co-Investment Fund III.\n  * Existing financing schemes offered by Enterprise Singapore will be streamlined into a single Enterprise Financing Scheme that will cover trade, working capital, fixed assets, venture debt, mergers and acquisitions, and project financing. This will be launched in October this year.\n  * Enterprise Financing Scheme will provide stronger support for companies that have been incorporated for less than five years. The Government will take on up to 70% of the risk for bank loans to these young companies, compared to the current 50% under most existing loan schemes.\n  * To support viable SMEs in their day-to-day operations, the SME Working Capital Loan scheme will be extended for about two more years, till March 2021.

With our\nfocus on marketing at the strategic level, less attention is given to the\nspecific tactical decisions made by marketers to implement particular\nstrategies. Each session covers a topic that is of importance to marketers and\nsenior management. The first part of the course focuses on a customer-centric\napproach to marketing strategy. We examine how to identify, create, sustain,\nand leverage customer value to create value for the firm. In other words, we\nplace the organisation's capabilities at the service of customers and not the\nother way around. We then discuss the Marketing function within the broader\ncontext of the firm, particularly as it relates to globalisation and to the\ninterface with Sales. Finally, we focus on marketing analytics, emphasizing\nthe manager's role and perspective (rather than that of the analyst).\n\n##### Programmes with this elective\n\n      * [ Executive MBA Dubai ](/masters-degrees/executive-mba-dubai)\n      * [ Executive MBA London ](/masters-degrees/executive-mba-london)\n      * [ EMBA-Global Americas & Europe ](/masters-degrees/emba-global-americas-and-europe)\n      * [ EMBA-Global Asia ](/masters-degrees/emba-global-asia)\n      * [ Masters in Analytics and Management ](/masters-degrees/masters-in-analytics-and-management)\n      * [ MBA ](/masters-degrees/mba)\n      * [ Masters in Management ](/masters-degrees/masters-in-management)\n      * [ LBS Sloan Masters in Leadership and Strategy ](/masters-degrees/sloan-masters-in-leadership-and-strategy)\n\n##### Elective currently taught by\n\n      * [ ![RobWaiser113x113](/-/media/images/people/faculty/rob-waiser/rob-waiser-small.jpg?h=113&w=113&la=en&hash=CA02A82A363399CB5CE3AE5D8B1BB894A39B6207) ](/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/r/rob-waiser)\n\n[Rob Waiser](/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/r/rob-waiser)\n\n    * Behavioural Economics & Decision Making\n\nBehavioural economics is an emerging field that shows most decision makers are\nnot fully rational, and that their behaviour deviates from normative standards\nin systematic ways. Biases in judgment can lead to decision errors by managers\nand consumers alike. This also presents an opportunity, however, for managers,\nconsumers and public policy makers because it is possible to change and\nimprove decisions through behavioural interventions. The course will cover the\nmain behavioural theories and develop students' skills to test and implement\nbehavioural interventions through experimentation. Students will work on\nprojects in collaboration with an external organization. Guest speakers\napplying behavioural concepts in different settings will feature. Because\nbehavioural principles are applied in diverse settings, the course is suitable\nto a broad audience. The emphasis on biases and how decisions depart from\nrationality distinguishes this course from other courses on decision making.\n\n##### Programmes with this elective\n\n      * [ Executive MBA Dubai ](/masters-degrees/executive-mba-dubai)\n      * [ Executive MBA London ](/masters-degrees/executive-mba-london)\n      * [ Masters in Analytics and Management ](/masters-degrees/masters-in-analytics-and-management)\n      * [ MBA ](/masters-degrees/mba)\n      * [ LBS Sloan Masters in Leadership and Strategy ](/masters-degrees/sloan-masters-in-leadership-and-strategy)\n\n##### Elective currently taught by\n\n      * [ ![Ozdenoren small](/-/media/images/people/faculty/emre-ozdenoren/ozdenoren-small.jpg?h=115&w=115&la=en&hash=F1454DF7C235B3D75CA4812A51DF472063853C51) ](/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/o/ozdenoren-e)\n\n[Emre Ozdenoren](/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/o/ozdenoren-e)\n\n      * [ ![David Faro small](/-/media/images/people/faculty/david-faro/david-faro-small.jpg?h=115&w=115&la=en&hash=5C1065F47A7ED63F647CBE61FE2B4606D300A3B3) ](/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/f/faro-d)\n\n[David Faro](/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/f/faro-d)\n\n    * Brand Management\n\nBrands articulate a company's strategy, drive its execution, and are often the\nmost valuable asset on (or off) the balance sheet. This course highlights the\nstrategic implications of branding for organizations and delivers a framework\nand a set of tools for effective brand management. The course offers you the\nchance to combine theory and practice to understand the most important\nconcepts in building strong brands, maximizing the value of existing brands,\nand managing a brand portfolio. From a theoretical perspective, the course\naims to introduce you to the issues faced by brand stewards and to provide an\noverall framework and a set of more specific tools to manage these issues,\npaying special attention to emerging topics in branding. From a practical\nperspective, the course objective is to show how the principles learned in\nclass apply to real-world problems by making extensive use of examples, cases,\nand guest speakers.\n\n##### Programmes with this elective\n\n      * [ Executive MBA Dubai ](/masters-degrees/executive-mba-dubai)\n      * [ Executive MBA London ](/masters-degrees/executive-mba-london)\n      * [ EMBA-Global Americas & Europe ](/masters-degrees/emba-global-americas-and-europe)\n      * [ EMBA-Global Asia ](/masters-degrees/emba-global-asia)\n      * [ MBA ](/masters-degrees/mba)\n      * [ Masters in Management ](/masters-degrees/masters-in-management)\n      * [ LBS Sloan Masters in Leadership and Strategy ](/masters-degrees/sloan-masters-in-leadership-and-strategy)\n\n##### Elective currently taught by\n\n      * [ ![Botti small](/-/media/images/people/faculty/simona-botti/botti-small.jpg?h=115&w=115&la=en&hash=35E2A7E7183F284F39B1D005F9D9D7BD0771DD79) ](/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/b/botti-s)\n\n[Simona Botti](/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/b/botti-s)\n\n    * Causality & Field Experiments\n\nWhen is making a change to a webpage, an algorithm, prices or products\nworthwhile? Is my advertising effective? Businesses increasingly use\nexperiments to answer these questions. However, implementing experiments is\nnot always straightforward. This class teaches causal methods with a special\nfocus on field experiments, when they work and how to apply them. We will\ndiscuss how to measure impact in business situations and how to evaluate\nclaims of impact made by others. Topics include field experiments (also:\nrandomized controlled trials) and other methods that can be used when\nexperiments are not feasible. The methods can be used in a variety of business\ncontexts, but they have become especially important for digital businesses\nthat are able to easily implement experiments. Methods are illustrated with\nexamples from businesses such as Ebay and Uber and in areas such as\nadvertising, pricing, product design or distribution channel decisions.\n\n##### Programmes with this elective\n\n      * [ EMBA-Global Asia ](/masters-degrees/emba-global-asia)\n      * [ Masters in Analytics and Management ](/masters-degrees/masters-in-analytics-and-management)\n      * [ MBA ](/masters-degrees/mba)\n      * [ Masters in Management ](/masters-degrees/masters-in-management)\n\n##### Elective currently taught by\n\n      * [ ![Anja Lambrecht small](/-/media/images/people/faculty/anja-lambrecht/anja-lambrecht-small.jpg?h=115&w=115&la=en&hash=A1D58BD69B34AE983822C71CEEE8B14575341949) ](/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/l/lambrecht-a)\n\n[Anja Lambrecht](/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/l/lambrecht-a)\n\n    * Channel and Sales Force Management\n\nDigital technologies have disrupted the way firms interact with consumers and\ntheir distribution strategies. Established manufacturers and retailers are\nthreatened by firms such as Amazon that exclusively use online channels. As\nthe number of channels explodes, the need for coordination becomes vital. At\nthe same time, digital technologies facilitate new business models and\ndistribution strategies. This course focuses on how firms should manage the\nstrategic dimension of distribution channel choice and their channels and\nsales force. Students learn how to successfully design, manage and evaluate a\ncompany's channel and sales force strategy and tactics in B2C and B2B markets.\nThe course discusses the fundamental strategy choices and economics of\ndistribution channel choice, looks at challenges related to digital channels,\nintegration of broader channel strategies and the interaction of decisions\nwith other marketing variables such as branding, pricing or the product\nlifecycle.\n\n##### Programmes with this elective\n\n      * [ Executive MBA Dubai ](/masters-degrees/executive-mba-dubai)\n      * [ Executive MBA London ](/masters-degrees/executive-mba-london)\n      * [ EMBA-Global Americas & Europe ](/masters-degrees/emba-global-americas-and-europe)\n      * [ EMBA-Global Asia ](/masters-degrees/emba-global-asia)\n      * [ Masters in Analytics and Management ](/masters-degrees/masters-in-analytics-and-management)\n      * [ MBA ](/masters-degrees/mba)\n      * [ Masters in Management ](/masters-degrees/masters-in-management)\n\n##### Elective currently taught by\n\n      * [ ![Anja Lambrecht small](/-/media/images/people/faculty/anja-lambrecht/anja-lambrecht-small.jpg?h=115&w=115&la=en&hash=A1D58BD69B34AE983822C71CEEE8B14575341949) ](/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/l/lambrecht-a)\n\n[Anja Lambrecht](/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/l/lambrecht-a)\n\n    * Creativity in Business\n\nThis course addresses the biggest barrier to creativity in business - the myth\nthat being creative is the rightful preserve of the creatively gifted.

The course guides you through\nthe development and use of these tools without getting \"bogged down\" in the\ntechnical details.

Masterclass\nSeries](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-resilience-and-\nwellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\n**27th March** Strengthening the mental resilience and wellbeing of employees\n-  \nimproving employee engagement, talent retention and organisational\nproductivity.  \n[Register now here](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-\nresilience-and-wellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\nThe British Council and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development\n(CIPD) have partnered in a bid to raise the level of HR and L&D competency in\nSingapore.\n\nEffective 2018, British Council will run CIPD level three qualifications. The\nCIPD diploma in HR is a qualification offered at the British Council, which\nwill provide the latest in HR management principles to equip learners with\npractical skills and knowledge for a support-level role within the function.\n\nAnnounced on 20 November, the ceremony saw CIPD chief executive Peter Cheese\nand British Council director Roland Davis signing the partnership at the\nBritish High Commissioner's Residence.\n\n_Human Resources_ spoke exclusively to Amanda Moody, director professional\ndevelopment centre at British Council Singapore for details on the partnership\n\n**Q. How much uptake do you visualise for HR certifications in Singapore, and\nthe wider Asia region, in the coming year?**\n\nWe are hoping to be able to offer the diploma to new HR practitioners and also\nthose new to the profession - so in terms of meeting the government agenda on\nboth HR skills development and the rising workforce need for new career paths\nwe are well placed for a substantial take up to support the Singaporean\nmarket.\n\n**Q. What 's the one myth you would change about getting an HR-related\ncertification?**\n\nImage! The key to supporting organisational change to meet today's volatile\nemployment market is to have skilled HR professionals that can advise and take\ndecisions as business partners - so arguably in this global climate one of the\ncurrent most valuable fields to be qualified in is the HR profession. Its role\nas a secondary support function is a myth - as a profession it's increasingly\nviewed as having kudos and currency in the market.\n\n> ##### If you look at where the internal pain points are, increasingly\n> technology and digitalisation will become a way of life in the workplace.\n\n**Q. In your view, what is the biggest HR trend that CHROs must prepare for in\n2018?**\n\nIf you look at where the internal pain points are in organisations,\nincreasingly technology and digitalisation will become a way of life in the\nworkplace. So there is a real need here to understand and manage capability\nand talent, and for succession planning to future-proof employees.\n\nWe are also seeing a real need in global HR practice for skilled,\ninternational HR professionals who understand global context. So equipping HR\npractitioners with a recognised HR foundation and specialised skills in these\nareas will be crucial for the future.\n\n_Photo /[StockUnlimited](http://www.stockunlimited.com)_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

Issue](https://www.computerweekly.com/ezine/CW-Asia-\nPacific/CW-APAC-Expert-Advice-on-the-security-operations-centre)\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * __\n    * [__](https://flipboard.com)\n    * __\n\nIn our voyages from software conference to software conference, we technology\njournalists often find stories that are developing and worth sharing.\n\nAt [Percona Live Europe](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/Open-Source-\nInsider/Percona-details-state-of-open-source-data-management) last week, one\nsuch example came up around the open source scene that is developing in Russia\nand how one of the projects that is now starting to open up to international\nuse.\n\nThink about Russia typically\u2026 and you may not automatically think about open\nsource software. However, the country has a strong software developer\ncommunity that is looking to expand the number of projects that are used\ninternationally.\n\nAn example of this is ClickHouse, an open source data warehouse project found\non [GitHub here](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse). The technology was\noriginally developed at Yandex, the Russian equivalent of Google.\n\nAs [defined on\nTechTarget](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/data-\nwarehouse): a data warehouse is a \u2018federated repository\u2019 for all the data\ncollected by an enterprise\u2019s various operational systems \u2013 and the practice of\ndata warehousing itself puts emphasis on the \u2018capture\u2019 of data from different\nsources for access and analysis.\n\nClickHouse\u2019s performance claims to exceed that of comparable column-oriented\ndatabase management systems (DBMS) currently available. As such, it processes\nhundreds of millions (to more than a billion) of rows \u2014 and tens of gigabytes\nof data per single server, per second.\n\n## __Cluster luck\n\nAccording to its development team, ClickHouse allows users to add servers to\ntheir clusters when necessary without investing time or money into any\nadditional DBMS modification.\n\n> According to the development team notes, \u201cClickHouse processes typical\n> analytical queries two to three orders of magnitude faster than traditional\n> row-oriented systems with the same available I/O throughput. The system\u2019s\n> columnar storage format allows fitting more hot data in RAM, which leads to\n> a shorter response times. ClickHouse is CPU efficient because of its\n> vectorised query execution involving relevant processor instructions and\n> runtime code generation.\u201d\n\nThe central go-to-market proposition here is that by minimising data transfers\nfor most types of queries, ClickHouse enables companies to manage their data\nand create reports without using specialised networks that are aimed at high-\nperformance computing.\n\n## __Speedy OLAP\n\nThe technology, which is essentially aligned for Online Analytical Processing\n(OLAP), uses all available hardware to process each query as fast as possible,\nwhich amounts to a speed of more than 2-terabytes per second.\n\nThe project is starting to expand and get more adopters. As part of its\nmonitoring product launch at the event, database monitoring and management\ncompany [Percona](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/Open-Source-\nInsider/Percona-details-state-of-open-source-data-management) announced that\nit will use ClickHouse for load testing and to monitor accessibility and other\nperformance KPIs. Percona\u2019s leadership team originally hails from Russia, so\nthere are a lot of relationships there as well.\n\nAlongside Percona, [Altinity](https://www.altinity.com/) is also looking to\nexpand use of ClickHouse over time. Robert Hodges, CEO at Altinity describes\nthe company as a provider of the highest ClickHouse expertise on the market to\ndeploy and run demanding analytic applications. The company also provides\nsoftware to manage ClickHouse in Kubernetes, cloud and bare-metal\nenvironments.\n\nExplaining how his firm has developed alongside the core ClickHouse technology\nproposition, Hodges says that the enterprise version of ClickHouse can run on\nlaptop, yet be ready to scale up for significant enterprise workloads.\n\n> \u201cClickHouse is very efficient at processing and handling time-series data\u2026.\n> and it has SQL features which are great at monitoring specific cloud issues\n> such as \u2018last point query\u2019 [a way of looking at the last thing that happened\n> in a cloud application]. Say for example you had a bunch of Virtual Machines\n> (VMs) running in the cloud and you wanted to know the CPU load on them,\n> ClickHouse is good at that getting that measure to you. It\u2019s good to know to\n> the \u2018current state\u2019 of VMs, because from that point you can then drill-in a\n> look at the load over (for example) the last two weeks and so get a sharper\n> idea of performance status,\u201d said Altinity\u2019s Hodges.\n\nHodges also explains that Percona is interested in ClickHouse because it is so\nsimilar to MySQL \u2013 it has \u2018surface similarities\u2019 and has good abilities to\nload data into it and pull data down from it.\n\nThis project is an example of how open source communities can expand with new\napproaches to existing problems.\n\n< class=\"wp-caption-text\">Altinity is a service and software provider for\nClickHouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/ux/responsive/img/reg_wrapper_curl.png)\n\nDownload this free guide\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/IT_Priorities_2020_APAC.jpg)\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/ux/responsive/img/reg_cover_curl.png)\n\n## Why digital transformation is needed now more than ever\n\nAmid all the uncertainty of COVID-19, one thing that has become clear is that\norganisations must digitise to survive. According to Computer Weekly's 2020 IT\nPriorities survey, APAC organisations were focused on digital transformation\ninitiatives that improve employee experience and productivity, automation and\ncloud services - areas that have become crucial as businesses navigate their\nway through the next few months.\n\nStart Download\n\n  * Corporate E-mail Address:\n\nYou forgot to provide an Email Address.\n\nThis email address doesn\u2019t appear to be valid.\n\nThis email address is already registered.

Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\nThe Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) [Job Vacancies 2018\nreport](https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Job-Vacancies-2018.aspx) released\nyesterday (19 March) highlighted that employers are increasingly looking\nbeyond academic qualifications, when hiring PMETs.\n\nIn fact, the proportion of PMET vacancies not focusing mainly on academic\nqualifications rose from 42% in 2017 to 52% last year. Instead, employers\nhiring for these positions placed more importance on relevant skills, work\nexperience, soft skills and the right attitude than on qualifications. For\ninstance, in hiring systems analysts and commercial and marketing sales\nexecutives.\n\n\n\n![Priya-MOM-Job-Vacancies-Report-2018-job-qualifications](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/03/20103415/Priya-MOM-Job-Vacancies-Report-2018-job-\nqualifications-700x418.jpg)\n\n\n\n### 42% of job vacancies were for new roles\n\nApart from the above, Singapore's employment landscape saw a total of 63,300\njob vacancies last year, with newly-created positions comprising 42%.\n\nThese positions were commonly in the social and personal services,\nmanufacturing, information and communications, and community sectors.\n\n![Priya-MOM-Job-Vacancies-Report-2018-screengrab](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/03/20102856/Priya-MOM-Job-Vacancies-\nReport-2018-screengrab-700x475.jpg)\n\n\n\nThere was also an increase in the professionals, managers, executives and\ntechnicians (PMET) share of job vacancies, reaching 53% in 2018.\n\nThis was a result of the increase in openings from PMET-dominated industries\nincluding professional services, information and communications, and financial\nand insurance services.\n\nAt the same time, the share for clerical, sales and service workers declined\n(23%), while that for production and transport operators, cleaners and\nlabourers remained unchanged (24%).\n\n\n\n![Priya-MOM-Job-Vacancies-Report-2018-shares-total-screengrab](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/03/20102821/Priya-MOM-Job-Vacancies-Report-2018-shares-\ntotal-screengrab-700x429.jpg)\n\n\n\n### 1 in 3 job vacancies remained unfilled for at least 6 months\n\nOn a more mellow front, one in three job vacancies were unfilled for six\nmonths or more in 2018 (34%), a 1% increase from 2017.\n\nIn these openings, a trend was seen whereby non-PMET roles were tougher to\nfill than that for PMETs. Based on employer feedback, this was because of a\nmismatch in the pay and working conditions offered, with what job seekers were\nlooking for.

It will be headed by Demis Bhojoo,\nformerly of Amazon, who has been working in Deliveroo\u2019s London HQ performance\nanalytics team.\n\nThe BIU will recruit for specialised talent in data analytics, although\nspecific numbers aren't available yet on the recruitment targets. Deliveroo\nmay expand to build a team in Hong Kong as well, per the statement provided to\n_Human Resources_.\n\n**Deliveroo GM, Singapore, Sid Shanker** , said: \"APAC is a vital market for\nDeliveroo. By increasing our expertise in the region we will be able to offer\nthe best possible service to riders, restaurants and customers.\"\n\n**Demis Bhojoo** added: \"This new unit will be hiring the brightest and the\nbest in the region, while also looking for new partnerships with local\nbusinesses. In time we will have a footprint in multiple markets and we are\nvery excited about Deliveroo\u2019s continued expansion.\"\n\nThe unit, operating out of Deliveroo Singapore\u2019s corporate office in Tanjong\nPagar, will be tasked with the following functions:\n\n  * To deepen understanding of the region - local food trends, tastes and restaurant markets\n  * To enhance performance for riders, restaurants and customers\n  * To look for expansion opportunities in existing countries and new markets\n\nTo take an example, riders' earnings are expected to get a boost, as the unit\nwill optimise the size of the rider fleet by predicting how many riders will\nbe required in any location for a given week.\n\nIn cases where riders plan to ride in certain areas in advance, Deliveroo can\nmake sure there are the right number of riders on the road to match consumer\ndemand, or Deliveroo will tell riders where work is available. This ensures\nriders know that work will be available.\n\n**ALSO READ:** [Avaloq launches regional HQ and service facilities in\nSingapore](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/avaloq-launches-regional-hq-\nand-service-facilities-in-singapore/ \"Avaloq launches regional HQ and service\nfacilities in Singapore\")\n\nA similar unit has previously been set up by Deliveroo in the UK, credited\nwith 80% of all customers' calls and chats being picked up in 15 seconds or\nless per hour of day.\n\nOn why Singapore was chosen for the second such BIU, Shanker spoke exclusively\nto _Human Resources_ : \"We chose Singapore as our APAC headquarters as it\nserves as the ideal testbed to trial data-based solutions. Due to the smaller\nmarket size and diverse audience who consist of early adopters of trends\nwilling to provide insightful feedback, the process of implementing and\nrefining new models is more seamless.\"\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

Data](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/insights/big-data/)\n[Latest News](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/latest-news/)\n\nby [Sandra Sommerville](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/sandra/ \"Posts\nby Sandra Sommerville\") [October 2,\n2018](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2018/10/) [0\ncomments](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/leveraging-the-benefits-of-big-\ndata-in-payroll/#comments)\n\n![Big Data](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Big-\nData-in-Payroll-1024x683.jpg)\n\n_**The big data revolution is transforming the business landscape - not least\nin the form of the benefits, it can deliver for payroll departments.**_\n\nThe modern business landscape thrives on information - not least in payroll\ndepartments, where employees must handle a variety of specialised information\nto carry out the pay process each month. But data is only as useful as your\nbusiness\u2019 ability to exploit and handle it - which is why the big data\nrevolution is such an interesting proposition for payroll.\n\nThe application of big data in business is growing. Recent research revealed\nthat, in 2017, the adoption of big data reached 53% - a dramatic rise from 17%\nin 2015. Big data applications promise to transform payroll, adding efficiency\nand insight to the process, and helping employers achieve a greater degree of\ncompliance - but, if you\u2019re considering ways to integrate big data into your\npayroll deployment, it\u2019s worth understanding the benefits before you make the\nleap.\n\n\n\n###### **Finding Talent**\n\nPayroll is a process which succeeds on the _[talent and\nabilities](https://www.recruiter.com/i/how-to-start-a-career-in-payroll/)_ of\nits employees - but finding those recruits represents a formidable challenge\nfor employers. One of the most interesting applications of big data is to help\nemployers build a multi-skilled payroll workforce by scrutinising factors such\nas employee feedback, customer surveys, sales data and industry trends - and\nusing that information to formulate hiring strategies. Similarly, big data\ncould help recruiters identify the kinds of employee they need to be hiring -\nand where to find them.\n\n\n\n###### **Record Keeping**\n\nPayroll involves the management and storage of varying amounts of data on a\ndaily basis. One of the more practical applications of big data tools,\nincluding _[cloud computing platforms](https://magazine.startus.cc/how-cloud-\nsolutions-help-improve-payroll-process/)_ , is to provide a space for the\nstorage and access of that data - which includes work hours, overtime,\nsickness and pension benefits, tax codes and so on. The ability to navigate\nthat data efficiently during the pay process represents a valuable benefit for\npayroll administrators.\n\n\n\n###### **Addressing Mistakes**\n\nBig data offers employers a new perspective on the finer details of their\npayroll process - and the various small errors and problems which might be\nholding it back. From compliance challenges to missed deadlines, the analytic\ncapability of big data can reveal where those errors are occurring, and how\noften - helping to establish trends over time, and revealing ways employers\ncan enhance payroll infrastructure. Similarly, analytics tools can be used to\ntweak payroll performance with increased precision - delivering productivity\nboosts over the long and short-term, during a weekly or monthly pay process.\n\n\n\n###### **Career Development Options**\n\nPayroll employees are amongst the most specialised members of your workforce,\nso it\u2019s vital they have the opportunity to develop and direct their careers -\nrather than risking stagnation and brain-drain. Big data analytics can help\nemployers examine the details of the employee experience at both a local and\nindustry-level. That insight can be used to help direct career development -\nfrom which training opportunities would work best for members of your\nworkforce, to the salaries which might be offered to help retain talent.\n\n\n\n###### **Global Solutions**\n\nBusinesses with a global footprint have vastly increased payroll data concerns\n- but must contend with uneven and unpredictable compliance environments. Big\ndata tools help businesses with international interests manage and harmonise\nthe data they generate across their international territories - and use it to\ndevelop and implement a _[global payroll\nsolution](https://www.activpayroll.com/what-we-do/global-payroll)_. Big data\noffers a way to contend with fluctuations in exchange rates, complicated\ncompliance regulations, and even the administrative challenges of distance and\ntime zones.\n\n\n\n###### **Decision Making**\n\nWhile big data tools have plenty of practical, immediate applications, they\ncan also contribute significantly to a business\u2019 decision making strategy.\nGoing beyond the imitations of the human perspective, Big data analysis can\nreveal trends and patterns which might have been otherwise impossible to\npredict. With this in mind, big data might be used to challenge conventional\napproaches to payroll administration, preparing a business for upcoming\nchallenges or changes in legislation, and for making _[important\ndecisions](http://www.bytestart.co.uk/outsource-payroll-benefits-when-to-\ndo.html)_ about its future - like whether to transition to monthly or weekly\npay, or whether to outsource aspects of the payroll process to a service\nprovider.\n\n\n\n###### **Thinking Outside the Box**\n\nThe true power of big data lies in its potential to change the way businesses\nthink about payroll and how it should be delivered by their organisation. The\ninnovation inherent in big data technology continues to gather pace, meaning\nthat employers can explore for themselves the ways in which they can use it to\nmake positive changes in their organisations. As payroll software and digital\ntax tools are integrated further into the business landscape, the data\ngenerated by payroll departments will continue to expand and evolve - to\ncontinue to enjoy the benefits of big data, employers must learn to evolve\nwith it.\n\n[Big Data](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/tag/big-data/)\n[Payroll](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/tag/payroll/)\n\n## Share This Article\n\nDo the sharing thingy\n\n[\n__](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/leveraging-\nthe-benefits-of-big-data-in-payroll/) __ [\n__](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/leveraging-\nthe-benefits-of-big-data-in-payroll/) [\n__](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/leveraging-\nthe-benefits-of-big-data-in-payroll/&title=Leveraging the Benefits of Big Data\nin Payroll) [\n__](http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/leveraging-\nthe-benefits-of-big-data-in-\npayroll/&media=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/10/Big-Data-in-Payroll.jpg&description=Leveraging the\nBenefits of Big Data in Payroll)\n\n## About Author\n\nMore info about author\n\n[ ![Sandra\nSommerville](//www.gravatar.com/avatar/75617dbe93885976a305b3d5c132782f?s=130&r=g&d=mm)\n](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/sandra/)\n\n###  [Sandra Sommerville](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/sandra/)\n\nAs [activpayroll\u2019s](https://www.activpayroll.com/what-we-do/what-we-do/) Group\nHuman Resources Manager, Sandra Sommerville works to drive business growth by\ndeveloping professional talent.

In retail, well see AI\nmaximise cross-selling by providing hyper personalising content through\nintelligent recommendations, while manufacturers will increase margins through\npredictive maintenance, which maximises the usable life of equipment and\nreduce costly downtime,\" he says.\n\n\"AI will be utilised in real estate to analyse massive amounts of data on past\nhome sales, school districts, transportation and traffic patterns, and much\nmore to accurately project future value of homes and cost per square foot.\n\n\"In HR and recruiting, AI will accelerate the talent sourcing process by\nscreening resumes 15 times faster than a human to identify the best\ncandidates. And, in healthcare, AI will assist in medical, legal, and\nregulatory review for pharmaceutical companies to verify the development and\nmarketing of new medication that complies with all legal requirements.\"\nJarvinen says.\n\n\"As these industries rely on more data from users, AI will continue to\nadvance, learn and innovate the enterprise.\"  \n\n**Cross-functional teams will drive excellence in AI practices**\n\nCross-functional teams, sometimes referred to as Centres of Excellence (CoEs)\nwill empower organisations to create impactful AI projects in 2020, according\nto Jarvinen.\n\n\"These teams will represent the entire organisation and will include\nindividuals with business knowledge, IT experience, and specialised AI skills,\nsuch as data engineers, data scientists, subject matter experts, and project\nmanagers. The role of these teams will be to identify use cases and manage a\ndigital platform that supports collaboration on key business initiatives,\" he\nsays.\n\n\"They must also partner with the right vendor who has the tools and expertise\nneeded to help the organisation kickstart a successful AI journey. Combining\ninternal and external resources will be imperative to building and executing\npowerful AI projects that see the light of day and provide real business\nvalue, instead of getting locked in some corner of the office.\"\n\n**Organisations will build in processes and policies to prevent and address\npotential biases in AI**\n\nAccording to Jarvinen, in both the private and public sectors, organisations\nare recognising the need to develop strategies to mitigate bias in AI.\n\n\"With issues such as amplified prejudices in predictive crime mapping,\norganisations must build in checks in both AI technology itself and their\npeople processes. One of the most effective ways to do this is to ensure data\nsamples are robust enough to minimise subjectivity and yield trustworthy\ninsights,\" he says.\n\n\"Data collection cannot be too selective and should be reflective of reality,\nnot historical biases. In addition, teams responsible for identifying business\ncases and creating and deploying machine learning models should represent a\nrich blend of backgrounds, views, and characteristics.\"\n\nJarvinen says organisations should also test machines for biases, train AI\nmodels to identify bias, and consider appointing an HR or ethics specialist to\ncollaborate with data scientists, thereby ensuring cultural values are being\nreflected in AI projects.\n\n**The rise of augmented analytics and smart data**\n\n\"With a massive amount of information becoming more available to\norganisations, augmented analytics will become the next generation and\nfavoured choice for processing data and running business intelligence\noperations in the year to come,\" says Jarvinen.\n\n\"Through advancements in embedding AI and ML techniques, augmented analytics\nwill continue to pave new ways to lower the barrier on how we approach\ndeveloping and optimising analytics through new smart data discovery\nexperiences,\" he says.\n\n\"By 2020, we'll start to see major adjustments in the business intelligence\nmarket, with an upward trend of enterprise buyers purchasing more of these\naugmented tools and applications and incorporating into their data practices,\"\nJarvinen explains.\n\n\"As a result, the roles of computer programmers and software developers in the\nspace will shift to support building related features and the roles of data\nscientists and data engineers in the enterprise will shift, alleviating more\ntime higher order work on complex models and data projects.\"\n\n**AI will advance the development of smart cities**\n\n\"In 2019, we saw smart cities truly began to come of age. The next phase in\nthis evolution will be a significant roll out of smart city AI\nimplementation,\" states Jarvinen.\n\n\"Large organisations have long utilised AI and analytics to turn unstructured\ndata into more actionable insights. Now, artificial intelligence is opening\nthe door for applications and networks outside of the workplace to harness big\ndata more intelligently and engage in new ways with citizens and, as a result,\nmake our cities more efficient and sustainable,\" he explains.\n\n\"For example, AI can transform a citys infrastructure and power utilisation,\nand can also make strides in public safety, healthcare, and even make public\nparking more efficient. Increasingly, cities are utilising smart technology to\nfind innovative solutions to some of their most pressing urban challenges. In\n2020, AI will usher in even greater opportunities to make the smart city dream\nmore of a reality.\"\n\n**2020 will be the year of intelligent text mining**\n\nJarvinen says organisations will increasingly use sophisticated AI solutions\nto derive meaning from and contextually classify all types of content,\nincluding structured, semi-, and unstructured content.\n\n\"Gartner has estimated as much as 80% of enterprise content is unstructured,\nwhich leaves a vast pool of information for companies to leverage. Within\nthese emails, customer service transcripts, and other textual documents is\ndata that can provide real business value, as well as insights on which key\nbusiness decisions can be made,\" he says.\n\n\"Through intelligent text mining, AI solutions quickly read and understand\nhuge stores of content for accurate synopses and sentiment analyses, thereby\nallowing organisations to rapidly access the insights which demand the\ngreatest level of attention.\"\n\n**AI will become integrated in more enterprise areas and domains**\n\n\"As a logical next step of digital transformation, AI will penetrate more\nareas of the enterprise. AI is being increasingly leveraged across many\ncustomer-facing functions, including chatbots for improving customer service,\"\nsays Jarvinen.\n\n\"AI solutions are also widely used for categorising, classifying, and routing\nenterprise data and content. Yet, as organisations continue to embrace the\nbenefits of AI, we will continue to see even further applications of the\ntechnology across more areas of the enterprise,\" he says.\n\n\"This might include using AI and machine learning to respond to evolving\ncybersecurity threats, managing compliance by leveraging predictive analytics\nand specific algorithms to detect abnormalities that could lead to risks, and\nincorporating AI into marketing activities such as analysing customer\nsentiment and triggering offers to the right segments at the right time.\"\n\nRelated stories:\n\n[ __74% of

It's the adoption of tech to address the whole system and\nprocess approach that counts.\n\nI is critical as it stands for integration - we cannot transform without\ngetting the whole company transformed. Technology alone won't work. We need\nthe alignment of tech, talent and trust, believing that change is needed to\nbuild a more sustainable company, industry and ecosystem.\n\nG is for growth which cannot happen if individuals and companies do not\ncollaborate to innovate. The worst of times is the best of times to dig in -\nmarry your domain expertise with other tech partners or startups and develop\nyour people with real projects to be implemented. Almost like a live lab -\nexperiment and learn. Time to DIG in together.\n\n* * *\n\n**Victor Mills  \nChief Executive  \nSingapore International Chamber of Commerce **\n\nEvery Singapore government annual budget is designed to sustain Singapore's\nsuccess. Among the critical, long-term issues are Singapore's further plans to\nmitigate the effects of climate change and the incentivisation of businesses\nand consumers to be less wasteful. Behaviour must change, and the best way is\nby financial carrots and sticks. Businesses should be rewarded for using less\nof the earth's resources and recycling more of what they use. Consumers should\nbe rewarded for using less plastic and recycling with care. Another longterm\nissue is how our society will end ageism in the workforce to maximise citizen\npotential.\n\n* * *\n\n**Cheung Pui Yuen  \nChief Executive Officer  \nDeloitte Singapore **\n\nWhile it is crucial that this year's Budget address the immediate concerns of\nSingaporeans during this time of increasing volatility, the long-term planning\nto prepare our economy for the future should not be derailed. Businesses need\nsupport, not only to tide through potentially trying times as they adapt to\nglobal changes, but also in their quest to succeed, expand and innovate in\nline with Singapore's ongoing economic transformation.\n\nPolicy support to develop and deepen workers' capabilities should continue to\nremain high priority to assure the workforce of their jobs, and to make\navailable quality human capital for businesses. Tackling climate change and\nencouraging sustainability efforts are other areas that require attention.\n\nCitizen welfare in terms of health care and social support is also\nfundamental, given Singapore's ageing population. The changes in recent years\nwarrant measures that better reflect our economic, environmental and social\nneeds.\n\n* * *\n\n**Jayajyoti Sengupta  \nHead of Asia-Pacific, Japan, India and Middle East  \nCognizant **\n\nUnlike past technology shifts, today's digital era is about the coming\ntogether of multiple technologies such as automation, artificial intelligence,\nmachine learning and augmented reality. We are therefore less likely to see\nlong periods of stability.\n\nThis has made it imperative for all key stakeholders such as the government,\nindustry and academia to continually collaborate in conceiving and driving new\nskilling approaches to facilitate greater innovation and build deeper, more\ndiverse cross-functional competencies that the digital era mandates.\n\nThe 2020 Budget should focus on creating the necessary frameworks and\nplatforms for Singapore to expand this collaboration, enabling society,\nbusiness and governance to better embrace and benefit from the transformative\npotential of digital technologies.\n\n* * *\n\n**John Lombard  \nAsia Pacific CEO  \nNTT Ltd **\n\nToday's digital economy has created large-scale demand for automation,\nartificial intelligence and analytics skills, as we increasingly deploy these\ndigital technologies to improve the way we work, live and play.\n\nThis year, concerns over the global economic slowdown are driving businesses\nto focus on increasing productivity and efficiency through the use of smart\ntechnologies as a key business priority. Budget 2020 can play a pivotal role\nin enabling their digital transformation journey. It should offer fiscally\nsustainable measures and incentives that can help businesses stay relevant and\ncompetitive to encourage innovation and digitalisation as Singapore pushes\nahead to achieve its vision of becoming a leading AI hub.\n\n* * *\n\n**Max Loh  \nEY Managing Partner, Brunei and Singapore  \nErnst & Young LLP **\n\nBudget 2020 must invariably strike a balance between addressing the urgent -\nand the important. The novel coronavirus outbreak exacerbates business\nuncertainties and pressures caused by existing geopolitical and trade tensions\nand macroeconomic concerns. Short-term reliefs will be important to help\nbusinesses and people cope with the impact.\n\nYet, the Budget should press on with the economic transformation agenda that\nhas been set in motion at the industry and workforce levels as a longer-term\nimperative. Continuing to elevate enterprise and workforce capabilities and\naddressing the gaps between current skills and future opportunities in the\nworkforce is vital. Any periods of business slowdown during these uncertain\ntimes may optimistically be seen as availing companies and people of time,\nwhich can be reinvested into transformation, training and upskilling to ready\nthemselves for growth going forward.\n\n* * *\n\n**Yeoh Oon Jin  \nExecutive Chairman  \nPwC Singapore **\n\nWhile in the short term we must help those impacted by the coronavirus\noutbreak, we must not lose sight of the need to continue transforming our\neconomy to be fit for the long run.\n\nOur tax system must remain competitive. Tax incentives that are now less\nattractive due to global developments should be adjusted, and tax rules and\nadministration should be tweaked to provide greater transparency and certainty\nto investors. This would help Singapore differentiate itself as a hub location\nfor international business, being in the centre of a fast-growing Asian\neconomy.\n\nIt is by building for the future that Singapore will be well placed to\nwithstand external shocks from time to time.\n\n* * *\n\n**Lee Fook Chiew  \nChief Executive Officer  \nInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants **\n\nWe hope that Singapore's 2020 Budget will address the issue of educating and\ntraining students to be ready for the digital economy. The digitalisation of\neconomies is now the new normal.\n\nTo thrive in the digital economy, Singapore's workforce of tomorrow must\nintegrate technologies into their daily lives. This requires Singaporeans'\nmindsets to be changed from young. The education process should start before\nthe tertiary level. Early exposure to digital technologies, coupled with\neducation curriculum that focuses on building digital skills and fostering a\nmindset of resilience, adaptability and lifelong learning, will contribute\ntowards building a digital-ready workforce for Singapore.\n\nThis was also shared by panellists at the recent ISCA Pre-Budget Roundtable\n2020, where business and industry leaders shared insights on how Singapore's\nBudget can be shaped to advance the nation's future.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ho Nyok Yong  \nPresident  \nSingapore Green Building Council **\n\nClimate change is not going anywhere. Increasingly extreme and erratic weather\nphenomena will continue to affect billions of people all around the globe. As\na small low-lying coastal nation with an open economy, Singapore is\nparticularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\n\nClimate action on a national level must be kicked into high gear, encompassing\nproven measures such as green building to effect affirmative climate action.\nWe hope that a holistic, fiscally feasible and long-term climate action plan\ncan be put forward by the government in this year's Budget, alongside its\npriorities in social spending and business restructuring. This will provide\nindustry stakeholders with a clearer direction and greater impetus to take\nconcrete climate action for a more sustainable and liveable Singapore.\n\n* * *\n\n**Dileep Nair  \nIndependent Director  \nThakral Corporation Limited **\n\nOne secret of Singapore's success is to keep preparing for the future. This is\nunderwritten by the Budget - our long-term financial plan. Investment in\ninfrastructure is critical, including renewal of public housing especially as\nthe older estates age; extension of the road and rail network to keep\ntransport efficient; upgrading of the port and airport for maintaining our\ntop-class links with the world; and expanding our healthcare facilities,\nparticularly to cater for our ageing population.\n\nWe must continue to invest in economic restructuring to produce new economic\nengines that will propel growth in the future. Likewise, there must be\ninvestment in education so that our tertiary institutions both equip their\nstudents with the knowledge and skills that the new economy demands, as well\nas provide lifelong learning for adult workers. Only by addressing such\nlonger-term issues will we realise SG100.\n\n* * *\n\n**Tony Lombardo  \nChief Executive Officer, Asia  \nChairman, Lendlease Global Commercial Trust Management Pte Ltd **\n\nThe Budget should not lose sight of the Industry 4.0 revolution to continue to\nfuture-proof the economy. Our position as the regional hub for innovation\npresents the opportunity for us to continue to be a driving force for the\nIndustrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The Budget must support the country's\ntransformation into a data-driven powerhouse. Industry 4.0 increases the\nproductivity and competitiveness of our various sectors and will create the\njobs of the future. Looking ahead to the next year and decade, the right focus\non R&D and training investment would be key.\n\n* * *\n\n**Thomas Holenia  \nPresident  \nHenkel Singapore **\n\nRecent events have reinforced the VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity\nand ambiguity) environment we live in today. With people talent as Singapore's\ncritical asset and competitive advantage, it is imperative that incentives and\nmeasures for upskilling our workforce extend across technical competences,\nleadership abilities and instilling an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nIn this aspect, Henkel Singapore actively supports our employees in continuous\nlearning and leadership skills development while promoting a diverse and\ninclusive work culture. Sustainability is another key topic where we welcome a\ngreater push for industry collaboration.\n\nFor example, we see benefits from our strong engagement in the Together for\nSustainability initiative, where collectively with other leading companies, we\nare making progress on the sustainability agenda along the entire value chain\nof the chemical industry, globally and in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n* * *\n\n**Jayaprakash Jagateesan  \nChief Executive Officer  \nRHT Fintech Holdings **\n\nThe digital economy is set to play a larger role in Singapore's growth over\nthe long term. Financial technology and new solutions powered by blockchain\nwill become more prevalent and open new possibilities, transforming the way we\ndo business. Education and employment are two key areas that demand additional\nattention in the upcoming Budget to build a pipeline of future-ready local\ntalent.\n\nThe digital economy has no geographic limitations; it can thrive anywhere with\naccess to talent and connectivity. With the right steps in education and\nemployment, Singapore can become a leading global hub for fintech.\n\n* * *\n\n**Marjet Andriesse  \nManaging Director, Asia Pacific  \nTelstra **\n\nMuch has been done in recent years to encourage digital transformation,\ncreating a wave of digitally-mature businesses in Singapore. With the digital\neconomy of South-east Asia expected to triple by 2025, there is a clear growth\nopportunity for businesses that can engage in digital trade and take advantage\nof increased cross-border data flows.\n\nThere is value in investing in facilitating digital trade between Singapore\nand other countries. This includes practical improvements like the removal of\nbarriers to cross-border payments and the creation of common standards for\nartificial intelligence. This will ultimately lower costs for businesses, as\nwell as increase their overall efficiency over time. These digital rules and\nstandards will help create trust and confidence for businesses and facilitate\nthe growth of Singapore's digital economy.\n\n* * *\n\n**Peh Kim Choo  \nChief Executive Officer  \nTsao Foundation **\n\nIn just 10 years' time, a quarter of Singapore's population will be aged 65\nyears and above. To prepare for this, the healthcare system is being\ntransformed and continuous learning and volunteering encouraged among older\npersons. Yet ageism remains prevalent, causing many cultural, social-economic\nand structural barriers that prevented older people and society to reap the\ndividends of longevity.\n\nBudget 2020 can work with all levels of societies to bring about a mindset\nchange - to do a re-vision on the capacity and role of older people by current\nevidence, not prejudice, and to make removing ageism a part of the practice\nand mainstream policy.\n\n* * *\n\n**Peter Seow  \nCEO  \niPlus Living **\n\nDespite the government reaffirming plans to spend S$2.4 billion to drive the\ncountry's smart nation efforts and digital transformations, I believe more can\nbe done in this aspect. 2020 will witness an increase in the automation of\ndaily life, through machine learning, smart technologies, 5G\ntelecommunications and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nI would like to see in the upcoming Budget more long-term initiatives in place\nto enable traditional businesses to adapt to the new digital economy. Smart\nproducts and services must be made available for all homes and businesses to\nhelp with future-proofing our society. Paying attention to and prioritising\nthe needs of Singaporeans will also play a significant role in driving our\nnation's overall transformation success.\n\n* * *\n\n**Hari V Krishnan  \nCEO  \nPropertyGuru Group **\n\nIn Singapore's 2020 Budget, I hope to see a greater commitment to\nsustainability and urban development. Singapore has the opportunity to take a\nleadership position on urban living in Asia by evolving our current policies\nto better encourage and reward developers that champion sustainable practices\nacross all elements of their projects. These initiatives and grants should\nalso benefit those purchasing, and investing in green developments.\n\nIncentivising sustainable practices, not only at a large organisational level\nbut also a local community level, needs to be more aggressively addressed. For\nexample, how can we reward the community for being sustainability advocates\nand taking simple actions like eliminating the use of single-use plastics.\n\nI also hope to see ongoing commitment and investment towards technology that\nwill foster widespread sustainable practices (ie urban development processes,\nsustainable water usage, recycling infrastructure, etc), which in turn results\nin significant action against climate change.\n\n* * *\n\n**Turochas 'T' Fuad  \nMD, Southeast Asia and Korea  \nWeWork **\n\nToday's business climate is no longer influenced by just economic factors.\nUnpredictable and diverse factors have led to increased vulnerability for\nSingapore's economy. This has highlighted the importance and urgency for\ncompanies to be empowered with agility and flexibility to address the\nchallenges.\n\nAs South-east Asia continues to be in a positive growth trajectory,\nSingapore's position in advancing this growth will become critical. For this\nyear's Budget, I would like to see a greater emphasis given to supporting\ncompanies and their future-proofing strategies. From talent to infrastructure\nand operations, companies need to have the right support to drive efficiency\nduring challenging times and scale readily when opportunities arise.\n\n* * *\n\n**Sandie Overtveld  \nVP APAC  \nZendesk **\n\nHistorically, Singapore has consistently and successfully adjusted its sails\nto maximise global tailwinds or when faced with economic headwinds. As our\ngeopolitical climate shifts, there are a number of long (and near) term issues\nit should focus on in order to maintain its position as one of the world's\nmost competitive economies, according to the World Economic Forum.\n\nThese include: continuing to build its reputation globally for being pro-\nbusiness; accelerating its evolution towards being a leading digital economy\nwith an emphasis on advancing its artificial intelligence capabilities;\nchampioning cultural diversity and inclusion; boosting investment into talent\ndevelopment across its entire workforce; and continuing to pledge its support\nfor policies that seek to mitigate the effects of climate change. Ultimately,\nI believe Singapore will be able to weather any uncertainties as long as we\ncontinue to work together to build on its success.\n\n* * *\n\n**Martin Lim  \nCEO  \nElectrify Pte Ltd **\n\nThe present levels of greenhouse emissions are no longer tenable, having led\nto extreme weather events that threaten survival and business continuity. I\nhope that the Budget can place an emphasis on greener business practices,\nestablishing the necessary foundation for long-term sustainable growth.\n\nOne viable strategy is to encourage the adoption of renewable energy among our\nenterprises, leveraging technologies such as peer-to-peer energy trading. This\ncreates an avenue for private energy producers to provide additional renewable\nenergy options for consumers while allowing them to monetise on this surplus\nenergy, potentially accelerating solar panel ownership and renewable energy\nuptake in Singapore.\n\n* * *\n\n**David Kirubi  \nCountry GM, Singapore & GM, Transformation, Asia-Pacific  \nJohnson Controls **\n\nThere is clear urgency to address the impact of systemic and material changes\ncaused by climate change and global health-related concerns. The private\nsector cannot afford to ignore critical parameters beyond the financials.\nSingapore's Budget 2020 should look to better shepherding corporates to adopt\nthe triple bottom line, which includes social and environmental\nconsiderations.\n\nWe see real opportunities with the strides we are making in technology. For\nthe built environment, we now have unprecedented visibility into the total\noperational costs over a facility's entire life cycle. We can identify gaps in\nhuman and equipment productivity, physical and cyber security, as well as\nasset utilisation; hence significantly optimising resources and improving\nhuman experience while achieving business goals. The adoption of such\ntechnology can be accelerated with more bespoke policy by the government and\nprogrammes by the public sector.\n\n* * *\n\n**Tomas O'Farrell  \nCo-Founder  \nWorkana **\n\nWith the global economic climate becoming challenging, a Budget that addresses\nre-skilling and providing opportunities for the digital economy workers of\nSingapore's future would be progressive and strategic. As the status quo\nchanges and Singaporeans need the digital skills, programmes, that prepare\nthem for the shared economy would be critical for the on-going development of\nthe country.\n\nKey to this is the collaboration between the government, private sector and\npublic to understand and embrace new ways of working including flexible and\nfreelance working careers. Only by re-thinking how we work, can Singaporeans\nand businesses increase productivity and remain competitive in a rapidly\nchanging environment.\n\n* * *\n\n**Yu Tat Ming  \nChief Executive Officer  \nPacificLight Power **\n\nWhile it is important to provide temporary relief to mitigate economic\nslowdown brought about by the novel coronavirus to the affected sectors,\nsustainability remains of strategic importance in the long term. The Singapore\n2020 Budget should be geared towards preparing the nation for the future, with\ninitiatives such as schemes that support the adoption of best efficiency\npractices and improvements across different industries.\n\nFor example, grants incentivising businesses to adopt sustainable practices\nwill bring about significant reductions in carbon emissions and at the same\ntime create economic spinoffs in the form of new technologies. The overall\ncost savings and improvement in productivity will strengthen Singapore's\neconomy and make it more robust.\n\n* * *\n\n**Veronica Shim  \nFounder and CEO  \nEnvysion Wealth Management **\n\nOver the years, the Budget focused primarily on restructuring the economy by\nencouraging automation, risk-taking, innovation, developing test-beds for\nstartups, business transformation and support for lower income groups. This\nyear, the Singapore government should pay close attention to the underlying\nforces that will affect Singapore in the medium and long term. These include\nfactors such as climate change and rising sea levels, the pathway at the\nArctic that will affect the strategic importance of Singapore's port and\ngateway to the other parts of the world to skills sets that Singaporeans will\nrequire to manage the benefits and issues that 5G will bring. It will also be\nimportant to address demographic changes and the structural changes around the\nworld.\n\n* * *\n\n**Mario Singh  \nChief Executive Officer  \nFullerton Markets **\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Singapore's success is its commitment to plan for the\nfuture. Against this backdrop, there are three areas which Budget 2020 should\naddress with a long-term perspective:\n\n1) Better urban planning - As the population increases, the government needs\nto look into areas such as housing, pollution, traffic congestion and\ninfrastructure. One praiseworthy initiative is that Singapore has set a target\nto have 80 per cent of its buildings with the BCA Green Mark certification by\n2030.\n\n2) Stronger global competitiveness - In October 2019, Singapore was ranked the\nworld's most competitive nation by the World Economic Forum's Global\nCompetitiveness Report. it is important that Singapore maintains this edge by\nintroducing policies that are pro-business and innovation-centric.\n\n3) Deeper Asean Integration - With a combined population of 640 million\npeople, Asean holds tremendous economic opportunities for the world. By\nintegrating deeper with our Asean neighbours in areas such as connectivity,\nfintech and sectoral cooperation, we would unlock even more potential for our\ncountry and Singaporeans as a whole.\n\n* * *\n\n**Isabel Chong  \nCountry Manager (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore) Electrical Sector  \nEaton East Asia **\n\nAmid rising energy appetites, greater support for the adoption of low-carbon,\nenergy-efficient technologies will be paramount to meeting Singapore's long-\nterm sustainability goals. Singapore's demand for power is only set to grow,\nand the Budget must go towards programmes and initiatives that encourage\nbusinesses here to invest in technologies that not only aid more efficient\npower management, but also improve power quality as well. As we move towards\nan era of smart grids guided by intelligent energy planning and consumption to\nhelp us in our transition towards renewables, companies will need to invest\nheavily into modernising and retrofitting their energy infrastructure.\n\n* * *\n\n**Alex Teo  \nMD and VP, South East Asia  \nSiemens Digital Industries Software **\n\nManufacturing accounts for a significant portion of Singapore's gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), and contributes hundreds of thousands of jobs to the local\neconomy. While the sector appears to be in recovery after a challenging year\nmarked by uncertainty, it is an important reminder that the industry needs to\nbecome more resilient against unpredictable factors such as global economic\nheadwinds and digital disruption.\n\nBesides encouraging digitalisation, professional upskilling is also crucial to\nempower talents to direct and control this technology, which will help realise\nSingapore's vision of Industry 4.0. This allows firms to be more adaptable and\nscalable, allowing them access to opportunities across a wider range of\nemerging industries such as biomedical and aerospace engineering, turning\ncrisis into opportunity.\n\n* * *\n\n**Kent Nash  \nGM, Asia Pacific & Japan  \nSolace Corporation **\n\nDespite the short-term market fluctuations, Singapore should not veer off from\nits long-term goal of building a resilient economy through continued\ncommitment towards supporting businesses' digital transformations. Businesses\nthat thrive in today's digital economy are ones that are ''always on'' -\nresponding to the events that matter, and anticipating the events, so they can\navoid problems and take full advantage of opportunities.\n\nHowever, this has been challenging as consumers have raised the bar on what\n''timely'' means and now expect real-time responsiveness. Technology is\nsupposed to help, but a lot of the legacy technology systems are not designed\nfor a real-time world. Having the resources to enhance the necessary\ntechnological infrastructure to achieve real-time responsiveness will be\nimperative for businesses to stay competitive.\n\n* * *\n\n**John Chen  \nVP, Global Forwarding, Asia  \nCH Robinson **\n\nDespite a challenging economic environment, a unified and efficient global\nsupply chain remains a major driver of competitiveness and market leadership\nfor export-reliant economies such as Singapore.\n\nThe 2020 Singapore Budget should look at continuing to reinforce our position\nas a global logistics hub. Initiatives focusing on grooming talent and\ninnovating technologies in wholesale trade and logistic sectors not only\nsupport our push towards becoming a Smart Nation, but will further reinforce\nour commitment towards helping businesses innovate and globalise. Open\ninnovation platforms such as Networked Trade Platform, launched in 2018,\nshould remain an ongoing priority development for Singapore in order to allow\nlong-term economic growth and value creation to take place.\n\n* * *\n\n**Munenori Ando  \nRegional Managing Director  \nEpson Singapore **\n\nIn the future, Singapore will continue to face environmental challenges that\nwe must be prepared for. While the government is already taking proactive\nsteps to address many of these issues, businesses need to do their part to\nhelp Singapore reduce its collective burden on the environment. Sustainable\nbusiness practices create long-term value, not just by strengthening the\nresilience of an organisation against change, but also positively contributing\nto the economy and broader society. As such, companies like Epson aim to\ncreate synergies through open innovation with partners and customers based on\ninnovative technologies, products and services, so that everyone plays a\npositive role in creating a better world.\n\n* * *\n\n**Joanne Wong  \nVice President, APJ  \nLogRhythm **\n\nIn preparing our economy for the future, Singapore has been pushing businesses\nand organisations to adopt digital technologies. Yet, a sound digital strategy\nneeds to go hand-in-hand with a strong cyber security posture, where\nidentifying and detection of network behavioural anomalies is early,\nresponding to and remediating threats is swift.\n\nHowever, achieving this requires more than beefing up on cyber security\nspending, but also investing effort and resources to build a strong technology\ntalent pool. This includes encouraging the current workforce to expand\nskillsets and getting our next generations interested in STEM (science,\ntechnology, engineering and mathematics). After all, Singapore's race to\nbecome a smart, digital nation is not a destination, but a journey.\n\n* * *\n\n**Axel Berkling  \nExecutive Vice President  \nKONE Asia Pacific **\n\nBudget 2020 has to address both short and long-term issues facing Singapore's\nbusinesses today. I hope that measures will be introduced to help incentivise\ncompanies to embrace sustainable business practices and support Singapore's\ngoal of becoming a sustainability hub. At KONE, we believe sustainability\nhelps businesses and communities to remain innovative and competitive.\n\nFrom an environmental standpoint, the Budget should introduce fiscal measures\nsuch as tax incentives and grants that will help promote investment and focus\non more green, energy-efficient buildings. Also, the government should\nencourage sustainable financing by offering tax rebates and exemptions for\ninvestors who invest in green bonds, social bonds and other sustainable\nfinancing facilities.\n\n* * *\n\n**Frankie Chia  \nManaging Partner  \nBDO LLP **\n\nA good balance between meeting immediate needs and building sustainability\nremains key to Singapore's future.\n\nWe must continue to push the boundaries and set the standards for a Smart\nNation. More incentives such as the investment allowance and enhanced\ndeduction should be given to companies which embark on digitalisation.\n\nAs companies in Singapore are climbing onto the green bandwagon, the\ngovernment may incentivise companies which actively go green - with perhaps\ntax rebates for reducing printing, using equipment with low carbon emission,\netc.\n\nIn the face of an ageing population in Singapore, the government can continue\nto raise efforts in shaping the future of health care in Singapore and\nactively promote healthy living and preventive health programmes. This\nincludes partnering with overseas academies to create opportunities for\nmeaningful collaborations where our researchers and scientists can tap on\nglobal networks to accelerate research and innovation.\n\n* * *\n\n**Abhishek Chatterjee  \nFounder and CEO  \nTookitaki Holding Pte Ltd **\n\nThe call for applications for digital banking licences heralds a new age in\nSingapore's journey to liberalise its financial sector, one that will deliver\nspeed, convenience and choice for both wholesale and retail bank consumers.\nThe rapid digitisation of the financial sector will inevitably present its own\nset of challenges.\n\nRecent events globally - such as a rise in fraud, money-laundering scandals,\nas well as cases around corporate corruption and the financing of terrorism -\npose very real threats to the financial sector. The industry sees a marked\nneed for greater efficiency around tracking illegal financial activity. Prior\nto ushering in the banking revolution, perhaps Budget 2020 could address\ninvestment into the revisiting and updating of the regulatory framework\nsurrounding financial institutions.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ivy Lai  \nCountry Manager  \nPhilips Singapore **\n\nThe healthcare industry is facing unprecedented challenges to improve\nhealthcare standards and manage rising costs due to an aging population,\nrising rates of chronic diseases and healthcare resource constraints. We need\nto invest in the use of technology to resolve these issues and challenges in\norder to improve patient outcomes across the health continuum - from healthy\nliving and prevention, to diagnosis, treatment and home care. For example,\nartificial intelligence can help people make sense of large amounts of data,\nwhile also having the potential to adapt to the needs of healthcare\nprofessionals and people, extend their abilities, and help them achieve better\nhealth outcomes.\n\n* * *\n\n**Stu Garrow  \nSVP & General Manager, APAC  \nTalend **\n\nAccording to an IDC study in the Asean region, Singapore is the third place\nwhen it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) adoption rates. Government\nannouncements on the implementation of a National AI Strategy last year and a\nnew AI Governance Framework a few weeks ago position the nation on its way to\nbecoming a leader in the AI market.\n\nThe government can further encourage this development by equipping the\ncountry's workforce and businesses with AI tools, training and grants to\nensure faster adoption of AI in this technology-driven economy. AI has the\npotential to reinvigorate the country's economy and boost its industrial\nprofits. According to a recent report by Accenture, AI could add up to US$215\nbillion in gross value across 11 industries by 2035.\n\n* * *\n\n**Vikas Nahata  \nCo-Founder and Executive Chairman  \nValidus Capital **\n\nIn the anticipation of a tough year ahead for the Singapore economy, business\nmeasures should be in place to address relevant business needs, especially\nthose of SMEs, to help them stay afloat and catapult. We hope that Budget 2020\nwill be able to better support strategies like growth financing for\ninvestments in technology that could help in technology adoption for SMEs to\nstay sustainable and grow, unlocking long-term socio-economic impact. There is\na need for increased liquidity through new schemes and greater access to\nfinancial solutions to help businesses better position themselves for the\nglobal economy's next upswing.\n\n* * *\n\n**Edward Senju  \nRegional CEO  \nSansan Global Pte Ltd **\n\nWith the changing market conditions and rapid fluctuations in the modern\neconomy, it has become incumbent upon businesses to continue to create new\nopportunities for growth - this is where a massive government push is needed.\nThe Budget must power up high-growth local firms to build new capabilities,\ninnovate and internationalise in the long run.\n\nWhile digitisation will be key to the government's business transformation\nagenda, offering help and expertise to overcome the challenges that accompany\nthis change is also a must. Moreover, automation support, if directed towards\nenhancing the productivity of businesses, will help the economy prosper in the\nlong term.\n\nPeople will always be a major driving force behind innovation and national\nprogress, therefore support measures offered must positively impact present to\nfuture generations. Empowering the workforce to upskill and engage in higher-\nvalue work will improve their future prospects.\n\n* * *\n\n**Matthieu Imbert-Bouchard  \nManaging Director  \nRobert Half Singapore: **\n\nIn order for Singapore to remain competitive on the global stage, the city-\nstate would benefit from continued support to accelerate the digitisation of\nservices and operations, which in turn is expected to drive many emerging job\nopportunities. Simultaneously, many companies currently struggle to find the\ntalent to support such initiatives. So with the skills gap hindering\ncompanies' ability to grow, plans and resources to help the Singaporean\nworkforce to upskill so they prepare it for a future of technological\ndisruption, greater competition, and economic changes is key for business\ngrowth.\n\n* * *\n\n**Dolly Goh  \nCEO  \nSingapore National Co-operative Federation (SNCF) **\n\nHealthcare expenditure, already the third highest area of Singapore's spending\nafter defence and education, should continue to be in the spotlight given the\ncountry's ageing demographics. Currently, there are subsidies on selected\nmedical services with additional benefits for Pioneer and Merdeka generations.\n\nBut in planning ahead, we need to factor in expenditures beyond basic\nhealthcare provisions. This is because not only is the number of older\nSingaporeans likely to double by 2030, recent official statistics show that\nthe proportion of elderly persons living alone is growing. With these trends,\nthe approach to healthcare needs to be holistic, covering geriatrics.\n\nSocial entities such as co-operatives can step in to address some areas of\nhealthcare needs such as long-term affordable and holistic healthcare services\nlike senior homes and eldercare centres. Together, co-operating with other\nhealthcare providers and the government, the aggregation of purchase of drugs\nand medical supplies could bring down costs for the end-users.\n\n* * *\n\n**Edmund Lee  \nManaging Director Singapore  \nTMF Group **\n\nWhile the Budget is likely to be dominated by immediate support and relief\nmeasures as a result of the novel coronavirus situation, we do believe it will\nstill contain longer term initiatives reflecting the government's policy for\nthe years to come.\n\nWe hope to see a continued focus on Singapore's Smart Nation initiative; more\nrobust measures to encourage and support firms to deepen enterprise\ncapabilities in areas such as digitisation, artificial intelligence and robot\nprocess automation (RPA), will position them well for the future economy.\n\nIn addition, with climate change's rising ubiquity, we are hoping the Budget\nwill reinforce Singapore's commitment to reduce its emissions intensity. This\ncould be through the provision of green incentives such as grants to increase\nthe adoption of electric vehicles, and public education on recycling.\n\n* * *\n\n**Laletha Nithiyanandan  \nManaging Director  \nBehavioural Consulting Group **\n\nSingapore needs to move away from focussing only on economic growth to\nadopting a more balanced Budget like New Zealand.\n\nGDP cannot be the only measure of success for any government; it needs to\nserve all of its citizens. The Budget should pave the way for purposeful\ncapitalism, innovation and needs to ensure we move beyond campaigns to action.\nGovernment and quasi-government bodies need to stop competing within the\nbusiness sector. They need to focus on core services and not be so caught up\nin making money. This will enable the business sector to create employment and\nboost the economy.\n\n* * *\n\n**Charlie Foo  \nVP and GM, Asia Pacific  \nMellanox Technologies **\n\nInnovation is the building block for sustainable competitive advantage in the\n21st century. National prosperity is created, not inherited. Innovation was\nthe secret sauce that propelled Singapore from Third World to First in the\nlast century. The incessant drive for continuous improvement and upgrade,\nassisted by technologies and strategies, helps produce a business-first\nmindset, world-class infrastructure and financial and political stability that\nSingapore is best known for today.\n\nI am hopeful the 2020 Budget will continue to put in measures to sharpen\nSingapore's competitive edge and the roles it plays on the global stage in the\nlong run, while inspiring new ideas and creating opportunities across\nexpanding industries in a sustainable way.\n\n* * *\n\n**Suganthi Shivkumar  \nMD for ASEAN, India and Korea  \nQlik **\n\nSingapore's 2020 Budget should address the importance of data literacy and\nrecognise its impact on the workforce. The data literacy gap is costing\nbusinesses across the globe billions of dollars in lost productivity annually.\nGiven that the data economy is in full swing, being data literate is no longer\nan option, and business leaders must do everything they can to ensure that\ntheir workforce is fully equipped with this skillset. With a foundation of\ndata literacy set in place, businesses can then enhance decision-making\nthrough the power of Augmented Intelligence, an approach which brings together\nthe best of machine intelligence and human intuition so smarter, bolder\ndiscoveries happen every day.\n\n* * *\n\n**Christina Teo  \nExecutive Director  \nSingapore Association of Pharmaceutical Industries (SAPI) **\n\nSingapore has made great strides in public health, with one of the highest\nlife expectancies in the world at 83 years at a remarkably efficient\nexpenditure of 5 per cent of GDP. However, on average, 10 of these years are\nspent in ill health, undermining Singaporeans' ability to live comfortably and\ncontribute further to the economy.\n\nTo address this, SAPI anticipates that Budget 2020 would invest further in\npreventive health care, such as providing further significant funding for\nvaccination subsidy and public awareness programmes; and increased funding for\ndiagnostics, including genetic testing, to detect conditions earlier resulting\nin better treatment outcomes.\n\nFor patients already living with illnesses such as cancer, rare diseases and\nchronic diseases, Singapore is a hub in South-east Asia for research,\ndevelopment and production of novel treatments that can extend and improve\nquality of life. Our 3M framework that encourages shared responsibility for\nfunding health care is unique and world-class. For instance, Medishield Life\nprovides immediate access to life-changing cancer treatment once approved in\nSingapore - faster than most countries.\n\nWe can further strengthen this framework by expanding coverage to include the\nfirst month of life, providing subsidies for all rare disease types beyond the\nselect identified ones, increasing claims limits for serious illnesses, and\nimproving flexibility of claims for outpatient treatments. While we can\nfurther enhance funding and subsidy, co-payment remains important to safeguard\nagainst the ''buffet syndrome''.\n\n* * *\n\n**Amit Anand  \nCo-Founder & Managing Partner  \nJungle Ventures **\n\nWhile Singapore is well on the path to become the country of choice for\nstartups in Asia, more measures can be taken to cement the attractiveness of\nthe country. For instance, it will be great to make Employee Stock Options\nPlan (ESOP)/Employee Share Ownership (ESOW) non-taxable for a couple of\ndecades to grow the ecosystem and attract higher quality global talent to\nSingapore - a critical element of building a leading startup ecosystem. While\na disruptive move, it will truly demonstrate Singapore's intent to support the\nrapidly growing wave of entrepreneurship globally.\n\n* * *\n\n**Naveen Menon  \nPresident ASEAN  \nCisco **\n\nOne of the key areas Budget 2020 should consider is how to encourage\nbusinesses to adopt flexible working arrangements especially in the burgeoning\ndigital economy. The success of flexible work arrangements, as evidenced by\nCisco's own experience, is a combination of several factors - good\ninfrastructure, suitable technology, and people's mindsets. Singapore already\nhas a head start in deploying world-class ICT infrastructure. As the country\nnow moves into the next wave of connectivity such as 5G and Wi-Fi6, there is a\nneed to ensure that such infrastructure is deployed with both scalability and\nsecurity in mind. On suitable technology, although leading-edge collaboration\ntechnologies are available today, full deployment and use of such technology\nstill only exists in pockets in Singapore. Budget 2020 can provide incentives\nfor companies to put in place and encourage the use of such technologies.\nLastly, one of the biggest challenges to enabling remote work is people's\nmindsets. It takes a shift in culture and an environment of trust for\nemployers and employees to telework effectively together. Budget 2020 can help\nby providing rebates for Singaporeans and businesses to adapt by training and\nretraining - both employers and employees - to equip us with the skills and\nmindset to fully leverage the advantages and capabilities of the ''workspace\nof the future.\n\n* * *\n\n**Maren Schweizer  \nDirector  \nSchweizer World Pte Ltd **\n\nA)Pave the way to a circular economy, by building trust and taking direct\nactions to manage climate change efficiently. Corporates and government should\nsteer outcomes jointly at a system level.\n\nB) Establish a landscape for technologies that don't exist.\n\nBased on emerging technologies, it's essential to evaluate what might come\nnext as the rate of change is speeding up. Innovation can offer solutions to\nthe challenges presented by our aging population, and the next ten years will\nbe critical for our preparations.\n\nC) Prepare for the makeup of the future workforce:\n\nIdentifying future roles, deciding on the skill sets needed to fill them, and\ndeveloping teaching strategies and educational organisations.\n\nNavigating the complexities of the transformative decade ahead requires trust.\nTherefore I see the need to review our governance models to harness the power\nof technology for good.\n\n* * *\n\n**David Baey  \nCo-Founder and CEO  \nMortgage Master **\n\nSingapore has done exceptionally well to nurture a thriving startup ecosystem\n- one that currently attracts 70 per cent of Southeast Asia's venture capital\nfunding, and boasts many emerging companies offering new services to improve\nour lives. As these startups scale, internationalise and export their\nservices, they create jobs and boost Singapore's economic competitiveness in\nthe long run.\n\nThe challenge for startups is competing with unicorns - with significantly\nlarger war chests - for the talent we need to scale. The local pool of\nsoftware developers and digital marketers is limited but demand continues to\nrise. We will therefore benefit greatly from the Budget offering rebates to\nlower the cost of hiring skilled labour and helping more accredited\ninstitutions provide reskilling programmes at a subsidised rate.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ng Yi Ming  \nManaging Partner  \nTribe Accelerator **\n\nNurturing entrepreneurship will help shape Singapore's future, and is thereby\na key area to address in Singapore's 2020 Budget. Removing the barriers to\nprogress like knowledge and collaboration gaps for businesses in the emerging\nfields like blockchain, AI and IoT will fuel their progress. The government\nhas already been showing immense support to drive the development of deep\ntechnologies and elevating these efforts will go a long way in securing\nSingapore's position as a smart, innovative and financially strong nation.\n\n* * *\n\n**Malina Platon  \nManaging Director, ASEAN  \nUiPath **\n\nSingapore needs to look ahead to become a Smart Nation and prepare for a\nfuture where our colleagues will come in both robot and human form. Automation\ntechnologies such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA) promise to drive greater\nproductivity and economic growth for many countries, especially Singapore\nwhich has made considerable investments in automation and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI).\n\nIn order for Singapore to thrive in the Automation First era, we need to\ninvest in ensuring the local workforce has the skills and abilities to be able\nto realise the potential of automation. Students - from primary school onwards\n- should be introduced to and taught automation and low coding programmes. Our\nuniversities should work with the private sector to incorporate automation\ntechnologies into their curriculums and companies should reskill and upskill\nexisting employees. The government should play a role in promoting these\nefforts and helping to fund where needed.\n\n* * *\n\n**Derek Wang  \nGeneral Manager, Singapore  \nAlibaba Cloud **\n\nSingapore's longstanding emphasis on the development of human capital has\ncontributed to its stellar economy and highly skilled workforce. As we chart a\nnew path forward in the new digital decade, Singapore must continue to upskill\nits workforce with the relevant knowledge and experience to excel in emerging\ntechnological trends such as AI and automation. As a member of Singapore's\nsociety, Alibaba Cloud is proud to be a part of the country's journey to\ntransform its digital natives into digital talents. We hope that our work with\nhigher and secondary/post-secondary institutions will help next-generation\ntalents hone their digital skillsets so Singapore's economy continues to punch\nabove its weight internationally in the long run.\n\n* * *\n\n**Nick Lim  \nGM, Asia Pacific and Japan  \nTIBCO **\n\nSingapore has always been supportive of the business sector, especially in\nhelping local businesses to gain a competitive edge. The government has also\nbeen committed to developing the skills and capabilities of local talent. The\nnext critical step will be to ensure continuous support for lifelong learning,\nthat will allow Singaporean companies to operate at a world-class level and be\nprepared for the digital economy.\n\nWe hope to see a continued emphasis on developing educational courses on new\ntechnologies, particularly in the field of data science, which will allow\norganisations to benefit and realise the value of data-driven business\ndecisions. Employers, educational institutions, and businesses must also play\na role in the ecosystem of educating the youth and upscaling the skills of\nSingaporean workers through committed partnerships and initiatives.\n\n* * *\n\n**Andie Rees  \nManaging Partner, South East Asia  \nOdgers Berndtson **\n\nWhile much has been said about reskilling workers so that they stay relevant,\nequally important is the need for business leaders to augment their\ncapabilities to lead their organisations forward. From our studies, successful\ncompanies are helmed by leaders who are agile, willing to embrace changes and\nare collaborative, which leads to greater staff confidence and commitment to\norganisational transformation process. Business leaders can be supported\nthrough continual and re-learning of leadership practices, and building of\ncommunities of practice. As a Chinese saying goes, while a fence is supported\nby three stakes, a capable man needs the support of three people. To this end,\nthere is value in building a robust ecosystem matching businesses, industry\nassociations and leadership institutions for learning, mentoring, greater\nnetworking and collaboration that may help leaders be better equipped to\nmanage through disruptions in whatever form that be.\n\n* * *\n\n**Lim Soon Hock  \nManaging Director  \nPLAN-B ICAG **\n\nSingapore should continue to be concerned with the lack of a critical mass of\nlarge local companies with global footprints. The Budget should address this,\nwhile there is still time, before it is too late, should foreign investments\nhollow out in the future to larger economies such as China, compelled by the\nneed to compete with the likes of Alibaba, Tencent or Huawei. There is the\ncritical need to ensure that the status quo - where Singaporeans have access\nto good and high paying jobs, as well as a high quality of life - can at least\nbe sustained.\n\nEnterprise Singapore's initiative to groom promising SMEs to become large\nlocal companies through Scale-up SG should be expanded to benefit more\ndeserving SMEs that need help to accelerate up the growth curve. The Budget\nshould seek to enhance quality over quantity in our large SMEs pool. It is not\nenough for SMEs to provide much of the employment in Singapore. There is an\nuntapped role for SMEs to offer high quality and rewarding jobs when some of\nthem evolve to be global players.\n\n* * *\n\n**Jessie Xia  \nMD, Southeast Asia  \nThoughtWorks **\n\nDigitally-ready talent will continue to be critical to Singapore's future, as\nthe country's robust Internet economy seeks to scale greater heights amidst an\nuncertain global climate.\n\nWith technological disruption already pervasive in all industries, the 2020\nBudget should aim to help companies raise their employees' digital\ncapabilities and soft skills - setting up internal initiatives and providing\ngrowth opportunities - to alleviate Singapore's ongoing job-skills mismatch\nand put companies in stronger positions to become truly modern digital\nbusinesses.\n\nThe Budget should also promote further collaboration between the tech industry\nand government, to foster deeper expertise in technologies including data,\ncloud, and platforms across the local talent pool.\n\n* * *\n\n**Toby Koh  \nGroup MD  \nAdemco Security Group **\n\nThe Singapore government has a reputation of planning for the long term. Hence\nmore targeted funding and effort have been invested in building longer-term\ncapabilities in our SMEs, the latest being Enterprise Singapore (ESG)'s Scale-\nup SG programme which Ademco Security Group is participating in. We are\nworking closely with McKinsey to sharpen our strategy across our Group,\nfocussing primarily on our overseas markets that have shown great potential\nand real traction, such as Vietnam, Philippines, India and Indonesia.\n\nI urge the government to continue to invest in promising Singapore firms that\ncan go out and grow regionally or even globally. Invest more resources in\nhelping committed companies build market access. This calls for more ESG boots\non the ground and other go-to-market resources. Getting a foothold in these\npromising markets is a priority and is certainly time-sensitive.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ronak Shah  \nChief Executive Officer  \nQBE Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd **\n\nComing into 2020, we see that issues such as technological disruption and\nclimate change that were major subjects of debate last year have continued to\nsee sustained attention on a national level. Considering our current volatile\nglobal economy, implementing training and continued skills upgrading\nprogrammes proactively is important and highly necessary in easing the steep\nlearning curve.\n\nWhile it is uncertain how far-reaching their effects can be on businesses\nhere, anticipating future needs and arming ourselves with the right tools and\nresources to mitigate these issues is how we can achieve long-term stability.\nBusinesses can also help to highlight the dialogue on key issues through\nactive participation and discussion at the grassroots level and as\nintermediaries for the public and government.\n\n* * *\n\n**Sng Khai Lin  \nCo-founder and CFO  \nFundnel Ltd **\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, support packages only provide temporary relief.\nAllowing people to fish the proverbial fish on their own would help a nation\nbetter navigate challenging climates. Today, private equity \u2014 a component of\ngrowing importance in a well-balanced investment portfolio \u2014 remains exclusive\nto the affluent because of an assumption that these accredited investors are\nmore financially-savvy. With proper education and regulatory support, retail\ninvestors can benefit from the private capital markets and, in turn, through\ninvestments, contribute to the economy.\n\n* * *\n\n**Bharath Vellore  \nManaging Director, Asia Pacific  \nAccuity **\n\nRising digitisation and automation is the reality of the world in today's\nworkplace, so the workforce must be prepared for this development. With\ninitiatives like SkillsFuture, the Singapore government has been upskilling\nworkers and we see sustained efforts continuing through Budget 2020 and a\nfocus on digital technologies.\n\nIn Singapore, the financial services and maritime industries are also a part\nof the digital transformation agenda, evident in initiatives like new digital\nbanking licences and the Networked Trade Platform (NTP). It is therefore\nimportant that the Budget reinforces these, as well as ancillary sectors, to\nhelp them keep up with regulatory requirements and the disruption around new\ntechnologies.\n\n* * *\n\n**Helen Ng  \nCEO  \nLock+Store **\n\nThe Singapore Budget 2020 should address the persistent challenges that SMEs\nface, namely, rising labour and other business costs. The implementation of\nthe Progressive Wage Model (PWM) amid a gloomy economic climate (which would\nlikely worsen due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus) has increased the\nfinancial burden on small businesses at a time when they are already\nstruggling to compete in the broader market. The Budget should also address\nthe administrative obstacles that small businesses face when applying for\ngrants and other subsidies. The application process is onerous and unlike\nlarge corporations, we do not necessarily have the resources to put together\nproposals that are ''ready for approval''.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ravindran Shanmugam  \nCountry Head, Singapore  \nLivspace **\n\nLocal firms need to build a culture of innovation, especially through\ntechnology, to remain globally competitive - and I hope this will be addressed\nin this year's Budget.\n\nThe interior design industry is a great example. Technology is transforming\nthe way homes are designed, visualised for customers, and built. A technology\nplatform brings together everyone involved in renovating a home (designers,\ncontractors, suppliers, customers) to deliver a transparent, high-quality,\nhassle-free experience.\n\nI would like to see the Budget increase funding for businesses looking to\ndevelop their technology platforms, so that this kind of experience is\navailable across more and more industries.\n\n* * *\n\n**Edwin Koh  \nDirector, Southeast Asia  \nLimelight Networks **\n\nAs Singapore gears up for 5G rollout in 2020, government and businesses should\nassess their 5G readiness to cope with growing levels of web traffic and\nInternet data. All these data must be processed quickly and reliably, and edge\ncomputing, with its capabilities to process data closer to each user, presents\ntransformative opportunities to improve latencies and reliability of services\nin the long run. However, to get there, the economy must take stock of\ninfrastructure requirements for enhanced mobile broadband, IoT, and mission-\ncritical applications, and put in place the necessary investments to realise\nthe performance potential of a 5G nation.\n\n* * *\n\n**Serkan Cetin  \nTechnical Director, APJ  \nOne Identity **\n\nCybersecurity was on top of the agenda in the 2019 Budget and the matter has\nsince gained significance. With 5G rolling out this year, new aspects of\ninterconnectivity will create unprecedented growth opportunities. However,\ntechnological advancements across industries may increase the risk exposure if\ncomprehensive internal and external cybersecurity measures are not\nimplemented. For instance, in 2019, 100 per cent of IT security professionals\nin Singapore who've experienced Pass the Hash attacks reported a direct impact\non their business, where most breaches involved compromised credentials within\norganisations' own systems.\n\nTherefore, the 2020 Budget should encourage enterprises to invest in building\ncyber resilience and emphasise the importance of digital security as a pillar\nof Singapore's digital defence framework.\n\n* * *\n\n**Leslie Ong  \nCountry Manager, Southeast Asia  \nTableau Software **\n\nBuilding a highly skilled, competent workforce and ensuring the employability\nof Singaporeans should remain a central economic goal and focus in this year's\nBudget. Jobs are evolving very quickly and there's a greater requirement not\nonly for specialised skills but also for the entire workforce to adopt and\nwork with new technologies. Working with data is one of the most imperative\nskills going into the future as the nation and businesses look to truly\ncapitalise on this valuable resource. The challenge is then to ensure that\nboth the current and the next generation of workers are equipped with the data\nskills they need to succeed in the future of work. The government has in place\nmany initiatives in upskilling the current workforce, but this needs to be\naccelerated if we want to propel the economy forward. From a longer-term\nperspective, we need to anticipate and skill-up the workforce of tomorrow. The\nBudget should address how education institutions can better anticipate and\nrespond to the skills needed to make today's students employable.\n\n* * *\n\n**Jean Thomas  \nChief Marketing Officer  \nPomelo Fashion **\n\nWith e-commerce growing at an unprecedented rate, e-commerce sales are\nprojected to top US$3.9 trillion this year. Whilst businesses realise that\nit's critical to shift towards digitisation to succeed and adapt to the new\nmarket reality, costs remain one of the largest roadblocks in their journey to\nscale up. To ensure differentiation from competitors as well as continued\nbusiness growth, there is a need to invest in cutting-edge technology, which\nmany successful brands have leveraged on to design great customer experiences.\nTo support high-growth companies to scale up and transform digitally, the\ngovernment can look at funding programmes as well as providing tax incentives.\n\n* * *\n\n**Praveen Kumar  \nGeneral Manager, Asia Pacific  \nASG Technologies **\n\nAs Singapore progresses towards becoming a Smart Nation, the government should\ncontinue to address enhancements in digital defence. Cyberattacks, data\nbreaches and system failures are some of the growing threats that demand the\ncountry's continuing vigilance. It is a key priority not only for businesses\nbut also for the government to heighten cyber defence capabilities, enhance\nprivacy controls and review existing policies, in order to achieve a greater\nlevel of collective cybersecurity. Digital technology is now an integral part\nof the Singapore infrastructure. Providing the right framework and policies,\nincluding enforcement of the same by the government, will ensure a safe and\nsecure technology environment.\n\n* * *\n\n**Sudhir Agarwal  \nCEO  \nEverise **\n\nSingapore has had consistency with its investments in education, healthcare,\nsecurity and infrastructure, allowing Singaporeans to enjoy one of the highest\nstandards of living in Asia. While Singapore's core challenges are of the\naging population and limited natural resources, Singapore's greatest strength\nhas always been its ability to think differently and think long-term. As 5G\nnetworks are set to connect the next generation of people, services and smart\nhomes, the 2020 Budget should address how it can seize the opportunity to\nbuild a transformational and sustainable ecosystem. To thrive longterm,\nSingapore needs to continue to invest in Artificial Intelligence, Internet of\nThings (IoT) and green-tech talent and IP. In times of uncertainty and rapid\ntechnological advances, we need to be innovative.\n\n* * *\n\n**April Tayson  \nDirector, Southeast Asia  \nAdjust **\n\nWith the rise of the digital economy, businesses in Singapore are embracing\nthe mobile economy with key technologies leading transformation in the nation.\nAdoption of emerging technology, such as artificial intelligence, robotics and\nthe Internet of Things is increasing as companies get ready to capitalise on\nfifth-generation (5G) mobile technology. In view of that, it would be\nexcellent if the government continues to provide grants and incentives in the\nmobile technology space to further encourage adoption such as the Startup SG\nTech initiative that supports local firms, ensuring that Singapore enterprises\nremain competitive in the global marketplace.\n\n* * *\n\n**Clara Lim  \nManaging Director, Asia Pacific  \ncommercetools **\n\nWith Southeast Asia's Internet economy continuing its rapid growth, the Budget\nshould look to help companies better integrate digital innovation, such as\necommerce tools and cloud-native services, which will become even more\npervasive at workplaces and in everyday lives.\n\nThe recent outbreak situation has also encouraged a surge in online\ntransactions and home deliveries as people opt to avoid public or crowded\nplaces. With brick-and-mortar sectors already affected - particularly in\nretail, F&B and hospitality - the Budget can minimise impact to the wider\neconomy, by helping ecommerce and delivery players shift towards more\ndigitally-integrated models. This might be done by encouraging adoption of\nheadless eCommerce solutions that enable real-time, on-the-fly adjustments to\nenable more individualised consumer experiences for business platforms.\n\n* * *\n\n**Andrew Chan  \nFounder and CEO  \nACI HR Solutions **\n\nWhilst I'm sure the 2020 Budget will contain some short-term assistance in\nlight of the coronavirus outbreak, ultimately for businesses to not only\nsurvive but to thrive in the future, it will rest on their effective\nutilisation of manpower and balancing that with how they integrate some form\nof digitalisation into their operation. This is where some companies may\nperhaps struggle as they're stuck in doing things the traditional way and are\nnot as prepared for the changing landscape; any government initiative that can\nassist in this transformation would be beneficial. No doubt our manpower is\nbetter qualified academically and technically today but efforts and\ninitiatives must continue to ensure it remains productive and future-ready.\n\n* * *\n\n**Sujith Sivaram  \nManaging Director  \nESCO Pte Ltd **\n\nTwo important long-term priorities would be\n\na) Enabling population growth by education and motivation. The social\nresponsibility of marrying, having and raising children should be taught and\ndrilled into young Singaporeans. Those who choose not to should have to pay a\nhigher price to remain in this society be it in terms of higher tax rates or\nhigher contributions to their long-terms savings.\n\nb) Enabling long-term learning and skills upgrading, by making it mandatory\nfor Singaporeans to upgrade their skills every 10 years until their\nretirement. Aiding employers to promote skills upgrading by allowing employees\npaid leave, allowing funding of these learning initiatives from long- term\nsavings, etc, are some measures that could boost lifelong learning.\n\n* * *\n\n**Andrew Tan  \nManaging Director, Singapore  \nHKBN JOS **\n\nWith global uncertainties and a tepid economic outlook, we are looking forward\nto seeing how the Singapore government will continue to help businesses,\nespecially SMEs, in Budget 2020.\n\nLabour shortage remains an issue in this manpower-lean economy. Instead of\ntapping foreign labour, it will be ideal for the Budget to address how\nbusinesses can leverage pro-business policies and strengthen digital\ncapabilities to achieve operational efficiency and stay sustainable.\n\nTo promote long-term business continuity planning, even before any\nunanticipated eventualities like the novel coronavirus outbreak, the Budget\ncan also include initiatives such as incentivising companies who adopt\nflexible working mechanism or digital investments subsidy which enables\nbusiness continuity. With soft consumer sentiments expected, businesses will\nalso need greater support to cope with rising business costs.\n\n* * *\n\n**Aaron Tan  \nCEO and Founder  \nCarro **\n\nThe economic impact of the ongoing novel Coronovirus has shown how vulnerable\nour economies are today. Being cognizant of this, the Budget should address\nboth short- and long-term concerns of businesses as they grapple with an\nincreasingly uncertain business environment. There needs to be continued\ninvestment in companies and technology that allows Singapore to grow beyond\njust being a strategic hub or a good spot for talent. As a country we should\nsupport local efforts to address important daily issues such as traffic\nmanagement, energy sustainability and financial empowerment. Introducing\npolicies and grants that support faster-scale and regionalisation of Singapore\ncompanies is crucial to creating stronger and sustainable local company\nsuccesses.\n\n* * *\n\n**Leonard Cheong  \nManaging Director  \nAdNovum Singapore Pte Ltd **\n\nSingapore's Budget needs to prepare the nation, people and businesses to\ninnovate, scale up, internationalise and adapt quickly to future challenges\nand an ever-changing economic landscape. The Budget should address:\n\n(1) Upskilling of elderly workers and women with digital skills coupled with a\nflexible work programme that will fit the needs of the digital economy - to\nencourage re-entry back to the workforce and ease the current resource\nconstraints\n\n(2) Deepening of businesses' enterprise capabilities and facilitating them to\nbecome a key ecosystem enabler in ASEAN, which will enhance Singapore's status\nas a business hub\n\n(3) Increased focus by the government to maintain a resilient environment and\ninfrastructure for the nation, people and businesses.\n\n* * *\n\n**Kelvin Chen  \nCEO & Co-Founder  \nKent Ridge Health **\n\nHealthcare spending will continue to rise as the population ages, and the\ngovernment will strive to ensure continued access to quality and affordable\nhealthcare. At the same time, any increase must be sustainable, with an eye on\ncosts, which are ultimately borne by all Singaporeans.\n\nAbout 70-80% of Singaporeans obtain their medical care within the public\nhealth system, yet the polyclinics and institutions are still overcrowded, and\npatients have to queue or are assigned an appointment date a couple of months\nlater when they might need immediate treatment. There are some private clinics\nthat might be less crowded. It would be great if the current system of\ndecanting patients will be able to automatically assign patients to those\nclinics. This could be a win-win for both public and private practices as the\npatients would not have to wait and the private clinics which have less\ntraffic would be able to help with these subsidised patients.\n\nAt KRH, through AI technology, myEUDA app is able to assign patients to our\npartner clinics with real traffic flow minimising wait time. It would be great\nif the government works more with private healthcare companies to leverage on\ntechnology to deliver better care for our patients\n\n* * *\n\n**Liz Kim  \nGeneral Manager  \nPhilip Morris, Singapore **\n\nThe 2020 Budget should continue to encourage businesses, big and small, to\ninnovate and transform their operating models by embracing new technology.\n\nWith transformation comes risk and uncertainty, but also the power to gain\nefficiencies and better outcomes for Singapore. The key to success will be\ncollaboration, and trust, between businesses, policy makers and society at\nlarge to ensure regulation keeps pace with innovation and societal demand.\n\n* * *\n\n**Dora Hoan  \nCEO  \nBest World International Ltd **\n\nBesides providing support measures for sectors hard-hit by the 2019-nCov\ncoronavirus outbreak, Singapore's 2020 Budget may focus on preparing the\neconomy to thrive in a rapidly changing global environment and to meet longer-\nterm domestic challenges, in particular, economic transformation. Allocations\nfor defence, infrastructure, education, and healthcare take priority.\n\nIn order to enhance the connectivity of our country as a global node, it is\ncritical to improve the capabilities of infrastructure facilities, such as 5G\nnetworks, MRT lines, airports, seaports. Infrastructure development allows\nagility to tackle innovation challenges. Meanwhile, digital defence is a new\naspect that also needs to be strengthened, to ensure a secure environment to\nsafeguard our critical interests. The education, skills upgrading, and\nhealthcare of Singapore residents have always been a continuing focus, to\nbuild a highly-skilled, digital-ready and diverse workforce to embrace the age\nof digital transformation.\n\n* * *\n\n**David Leong  \nManaging Director  \nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd **\n\nThis Budget is significant because it probably defines the collective\ndecisions of the 4G leadership and the future that it envisages for Singapore.\nWhile the Budget will set aside provisions for interim help for businesses, it\nalso has to prime the economy for future growth. Singapore's economy has to\ngrow on the back of intense regional and global competition while at the same\ntime dealing with stymied manpower growth. A Transformational Budget will be\ngood to set the tone and thrust of the government's focus in helping\nbusinesses shift from manpower-dependent production and service delivery to\none enabled by technology, robots and artificial intelligence.\n\nA reconfiguration for service and production deliveries will let Singapore\nplug into the global economy by becoming a central marketplace or hub with\nmanpower-light long-term strategies.\n\n* * *\n\n**Zaheer K Merchant  \nRegional Director (Singapore & Europe)  \nQI Group of Companies **\n\nOur Budget typically attempts to address various needs and priorities, often\nas equitably as possible. In current swirling times however, I am of the view\nthe Budget needs to address accelerated economic growth, provide businesses\nwith specific directions, evaluate disparities and ensure a ''one nation''\ninclusivity. This means that we do need specific tax rebates for businesses to\ngrow, a hold on any GST increase, and if we need to extend tax holidays to\nensure employment and manufacturing attractiveness, then this must be provided\nfor. My critical point is inclusivity however - as much as possible, no one\nshould be left behind. We have typified a neat capitalist economy. Perhaps\nwith difficult times comes the need for more social policies (though they\nneedn't be termed as such). But households need help, as do the needy,\nelderly, unemployed or under-employed. This can be in various forms of\nsubsidies or outright grants even if subject to some form of means test. But\nno one should be left behind.\n\n* * *\n\n**Henry Tan  \nGroup CEO  \nNexia TS Group **\n\nAs Singapore face the immediate challenges, there are also longer-term\nconcerns that will impact Singapore's future. Firstly, keeping Singapore\nrelevant in a world of technology changes by staying on top of the\ndevelopments and making Singapore an ideal place for innovation. Secondly,\nkeeping the cost of doing business in Singapore in pace with economic growth\nand not ahead of it by helping with wage credits. Thirdly, demonstrating\nSingapore's relevance in a highly connected world beyond being a major port or\nair travel hub. This entails demonstrating the value of the talent and\ncultural knowledge needed to navigate between the West and the East through\ncontinuous development of Singapore as a major education hub and think tank.\n\n* * *\n\n**Annie Yap  \nCEO  \nAYP HR Group **\n\nThere should be a greater emphasis and bigger budget to help Singapore\ncompanies globalise. The Enterprise Development grant introduced in Budget\n2018 was a great move to help firms internationalise and build capabilities,\nbut the set-up effort is taxing. Singapore's 2020 Budget could look into\nproviding grants or a one-time voucher for physical expenses like purchasing\nor renting office space and equipment in foreign countries. A list of trusted\nlocal organisations' contact details could also be shared so as to help\nSingapore firms get speedy assistance. Alternatively, the advantages and\nbenefits of expanding business in particular foreign countries should be\npromoted widely among Singapore firms. I believe that, with more help in\npaving the way to enter foreign markets, more SMEs will work towards the goal\nof globalisation.\n\n* * *\n\n**Teong Eng Guan  \nVice President, ASEAN  \nPalo Alto Networks **\n\nSingapore's resilience in weathering the challenges that lie ahead will\nlargely be determined by the government's continued investments in strong\ncyber defences to guard against ever-evolving cyber threats. Afterall, the\ntrue impact of a cyber attack in an era of IoT cannot be overestimated.\n\nHowever this is a shared responsibility, and future Budgets will need to\nensure that everyone is amply supported with the necessary education,\nawareness and resources to protect the digital infrastructure powering our\nopen and connected economy.\n\nRecent reports of hackers exploiting coronavirus virus fears to spread malware\nis a prime example of how cyber criminals will not hesitate to take advantage\nof every opportunity to cause damage, further underscoring the need for\ncybersecurity to be regarded as an important national priority.\n\n* * *\n\n**Matthew Bennett  \nVP and MD, Asia Pacific & Japan  \nVMware Carbon Black **\n\nIncreasing geopolitical tension has amplified the risk of state-sponsored\ncyberattacks that target critical infrastructures and compromise national\nsecurity. Also, cloud technology has created opportunities for governments to\nbuild robust cybersecurity programmes comprising prevention, detection,\nresponse and prediction. However, deploying new Internet-connected services\nwithout proper security will increase attack surfaces.\n\nThe Singapore government may want to invest in bolstering cybersecurity and\ncultivating expertise in this area. The Budget can also be allocated to\nencouraging public-private sector collaboration to address cybersecurity\nchallenges that no doubt will intensify in the long run. We all face a common\nadversary in cyber attackers and need to harness a united front to overcome\nvulnerabilities.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ong Pang Thye  \nManaging Partner  \nKPMG in Singapore **\n\nAs smarter technology becomes more pervasive in our everyday lives, along with\nthe compounding effects of natural crises, there is a fundamental need for\nenterprises to transform, particularly in the areas of digital and\nsustainability.\n\nSuch a need presents a timely opportunity for Singapore to establish herself\nas the Transformation Capital of Asia for the future, and when we further\nmaster and export this expertise of transformation as a business, it would\nultimately help to increase the tax revenue base and, in turn, lift the income\nof people.\n\n* * *\n\n**Chia Ngiang Hong  \nPresident  \nReal Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS) **\n\nPrioritising efforts to enable enterprises and workers build deep capabilities\nto enable the successful transformation of our economy remains crucial. So\ndoes preparing and grooming our children early in life through continuous\nlearning to be leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs of the future. In view of\nprevailing growing anti-globalisation sentiments and our small domestic\nmarket, it is imperative that our government, institutions, enterprises and\npeople double-up efforts to build strong partnerships, both within and outside\nSingapore, and making the region and the world our stage and our market.\nClimate change is another important longer term issue and this can take the\nform of enhancing infrastructure and other pre-emptive measures to combat\nrising sea levels, urban heat and carbon footprint to ensure a more liveable\nenvironment. Fostering a caring and inclusive society, strengthening our\nsocial fabric and mitigating growing unease over social inequality and divide\nis also important.\n\n* * *\n\n**Patrick Lee  \nCEO  \nStandard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Ltd **\n\nChanging demographics, digital disruption, trade protectionism and climate\nchange are longer-term issues that businesses must continue to keep a close\nwatch on. The Budget needs to address these through continued efforts to\nupskill Singapore's workforce, accelerate digital transformation and\ninnovation, deepen global trade linkages and create a blueprint for\nsustainable growth.\n\nSingapore's continued success will depend on whether it can sustain its role\nas a catalytic node in the global economy. As digital transformation continues\napace, Singapore must seize the opportunity and reinvent itself as a hub for\nglobal trade and financial flows. Efforts to promote trade digitalisation and\ndigital banking must be prioritised. They are certainly at the forefront of\nStandard Chartered's strategy in Singapore.\n\nWe are proud to be part of a global agreement to accelerate the adoption of\ndigital technologies in trade and commerce. We will continue to invest in new\ncapabilities in Singapore, eg we launched an FX e-trading and pricing engine,\nand help our people stay relevant through our SkillsFuture@sc programme.\n\n**READ

\u201cNervana\u201d\n\n[Artificial\nIntelligence](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/artificial-\nintelligence/) [Latest News](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/category/latest-\nnews/)\n\nby [Vivek Kumar](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/ \"Posts by\nVivek Kumar\") [August 22, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/08/) [0\ncomments](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/intel-brings-first-artificial-\nintelligence-powered-processor-nervana/#comments)\n\n![](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Nervana.jpg)\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing company Intel introduced its first high\nperformance artificial intelligence-powered neural network processor, named\nNervana. Showcased at the \"Hot Chips 2019\" conference at Stanford University\nin California, the processor is bifurcated into Intel Nervana NNP-T for\ntraining and Intel Nervana NNP-I for inference.\n\nThe purpose of this AI-driven NNP chip is to meet the rising high-speed\ncomputing and robotics demand. According to Intel, the Intel Nervana NNP-T is\ndesigned from the ground up to train deep learning models at scale that will\npush the boundaries of deep learning training. The processor is also built to\nprioritise two key real-world considerations \u2013 training a network as fast as\npossible and performing it within a given power budget. Social network giant\nFacebook has already started using its first AI chip, the company claims.\n\nNervana is built with flexibility in mind, striking a balance among computing,\ncommunication, and memory, the company said. Intel Nervana NNP-I (code-named\nSpringhill) is purpose-built for inference, intended to expedite deep learning\ndeployment at scale, and introducing specialised deep learning acceleration\nwhile leveraging Intel's 10nm process technology with Ice Lake processors to\nprovide industry-leading performance and communicate with the motherboard\nusing M.2, a slot that is typically used for solid-state storage.\n\nIntended for large computing centers, the Nervana NNP-I is developed at\nIntel's development facility in Haifa, Israel. It derived from the company\u2019s\n$120 million investment in three Israeli AI startups, including NeuroBlade and\nHabana Labs, Intel mentioned. It also comes with highly capable SW stack able\nto support all major DL frameworks. The main features Nervana NNP-I comes with\n\u2013 12x Inference Compute Engines; Intel IA cores with AVX and VNNI; 4\u00d732, 2\u00d764\nLPDDR4x; Dynamic power management and FIVR technology; 24MB LLC for fast Inter\nICE and IA data sharing; Hardware-based sync for ICE to ICE communication;\nTotal SRAM (75 MB); DRAM BW (68 GB/s); and, Next two generations in\nplanning/design.\n\nGeneral Manager of Intel's Artificial Intelligence products group, Naveen Rao\nsaid \"In order to reach a future situation of 'AI everywhere', we have to deal\nwith huge amounts of data generated and make sure organisations are equipped\nwith what they need to make effective use of the data and process them where\nthey are collected.\"\n\nIntel also expects the AI chip to run alongside its Xeon-based servers in\nlarge companies as the need for compound computations in the AI field will\nincrease in years to come.\n\n[Intel](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/tag/intel/)\n\n## Share This Article\n\nDo the sharing thingy\n\n[\n__](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/intel-\nbrings-first-artificial-intelligence-powered-processor-nervana/) __ [\n__](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/intel-\nbrings-first-artificial-intelligence-powered-processor-nervana/) [\n__](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/intel-\nbrings-first-artificial-intelligence-powered-processor-nervana/&title=Intel\nBrings Its First Artificial Intelligence-Powered Processor \u201cNervana\u201d) [\n__](http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/intel-\nbrings-first-artificial-intelligence-powered-processor-\nnervana/&media=https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/Nervana.jpg&description=Intel Brings Its First\nArtificial Intelligence-Powered Processor \u201cNervana\u201d)\n\n## About Author\n\nMore info about author\n\n[ ![Vivek\nKumar](//www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c59463ef7ad349924783ff338f26e9e?s=130&r=g&d=mm)\n](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/)\n\n###  [Vivek Kumar](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/)\n\n[More by Vivek Kumar __](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/author/vivekkumar/)\n\n## Related Artificial Intelligence Articles\n\nSimilar Posts From Artificial Intelligence Category\n\n[ ![WorkFusion Helps a Leading Bank Automate Account Opening with Intelligent\nAutomation](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Work-\nFusion-Case-study-173x130_c.png)\n](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/workfusion-helps-a-leading-bank-automate-\naccount-opening-with-intelligent-automation/)\n\n#### [WorkFusion Helps a Leading Bank Automate Account Opening with\nIntelligent Automation](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/workfusion-helps-a-\nleading-bank-automate-account-opening-with-intelligent-automation/)\n\n[August 9, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/08/)\n\n[ ![Significant Implications of Google CEO Sundar Pichai Heading\nAlphabet](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sundar-\nPichai-Google-173x130_c.jpg) ](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/significant-\nimplications-sundar-pichai-heading-alphabet/)\n\n#### [Significant Implications of Google CEO Sundar Pichai Heading\nAlphabet](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/significant-implications-sundar-\npichai-heading-alphabet/)\n\n[December 6, 2019](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2019/12/)\n\n[ ![Use of Robots for Combating\nCoronavirus](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/coronavirus-173x130_c.jpg)\n](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/use-of-robots-for-combating-coronavirus/)\n\n#### [Use of Robots for Combating\nCoronavirus](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/use-of-robots-for-combating-\ncoronavirus/)\n\n[February 29, 2020](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/2020/02/)\n\n## No Comments so far\n\nJump into a conversation\n\n### No Comments Yet!\n\nYou can be the one to start a conversation.\n\n###  [Click here to cancel reply.](/intel-brings-first-artificial-\nintelligence-powered-processor-nervana/#respond)\n\n__**Your data will be safe!** Your e-mail address will not be published.

This is what an employee\nexperience specialist strives to do.\n\n## What does an employee experience specialist do?\n\nEmployee experience (otherwise known as employee engagement) is the result of\nall the interactions an employee has with their employer. It\u2019s a specialised\nfield which focuses on creating a great working environment for organisations\nto get the most out of their people. This, in turn, is likely to drive\nproductivity, improve products and services, innovate, aid retention, and\ncreate a great employer brand to attract new talent.\n\nAs an employee experience specialist, you also need to understand the\nmanager/work relationship, proactively address the well-being agenda, and\ncreate a culture of trust within the organisation. Employee experience\nspecialists can transform the way people feel about their work; it's in their\ngift to reposition the organisation into a culture of trust through active\nlistening and action.\n\n[ ](/careers/career-options/employee-experience-roles/day-in-employee-\nexperience)\n\n###  [A day in the life of an employee experience specialist](/careers/career-\noptions/employee-experience-roles/day-in-employee-experience)\n\nA day in the life of Donna-Marie Gill, Employee Experience Consultant at\nDanske Bank\n\n[Read Donna-Marie's story](/careers/career-options/employee-experience-\nroles/day-in-employee-experience)\n\n[ ](https://peopleprofession.cipd.org/case-studies/nie-networks)\n\n###  [Employee experience case study: Power to the\npeople](https://peopleprofession.cipd.org/case-studies/nie-networks)\n\nHow a framework for listening and responding to every voice has given the\nchange-weary employees of Nien their spark back.\n\n[Read NIE Network's story](https://peopleprofession.cipd.org/case-studies/nie-\nnetworks)\n\n### Your typical activities\n\nHere are some of the activities you can expect to be involved in as an\nemployee experience specialist:\n\n  * Designing employee experience frameworks\n  * Creating ways to measure and assess engagement (for example, surveys)\n  * Designing approaches to communications which provide an employee voice\n  * Reviewing management practices and their impact on the employee experience\n  * Creating proactive approaches to well-being in the organisation in order to drive physical and mental well-being\n  * Reviewing and enhancing the employer brand\n  * Building a culture of trust\n  * Assessing the impact that people practices and policies have on the employee experience.\n\n### Why people deserve the best\n\nEmployees who put themselves on the line need to know their well-being is\ncared about, says the RAF\u2019s HR leader \u2013 and that\u2019s why the organisation is\ninvesting in its people function.\n\nPlay Video\n\n![](/Images/employee-experience-roles-video-\nstill-844x475_tcm18-58176_w794_n.png)\n\n### Types of roles in employee experience\n\nHere is a shortlist of the types of job titles you might find in employee\nexperience.

Based on our Survey _[1]_ , nine out of 10\norganisations across all regions have issues attracting and retaining digital\ntalent. With the current scarcity of digital skills, the rising demand for\ntalent and the prevalence in the workforce of digital natives who grew up with\nnew technology, organisations need to take a different approach in terms of\ncompensation and rewards strategy for digital roles and skills.\n\n\u201cAs skills become the make-or-break factor in sourcing digital talent, the\ncompetitive pay data delivered through traditional means need to be revised to\ninclude a hassle-free, skill-aware benchmarking experience that can be\nrepeated year after year. SkillsVue equips organisations with key information\nneeded to make skill-related compensation decisions efficiently and\neffectively,\u201d said Sambhav Rakyan, Global Business Leader, Data Services and\nCompensation Software, Willis Towers Watson.\n\n\u201cToday, digital professionals who have skills in blockchain, artificial\nintelligence and mobile are receiving the highest salary premiums, with a\nmedian of around 15% of base salary. Digital talent, especially those with\nspecialised skills, can have a significant impact on the organisation\u2019s\ntransformation journey. Having a differentiated reward offering will send a\nsignal to the digital talent that the employer recognises their potential and\ndoes not subscribe to a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 philosophy,\u201d added Paul Richards,\nGlobal Data Services Business Leader, Great Britain, Willis Towers Watson.\n\nUsing predictive intelligence, SkillsVue assesses the strength of market\ndemand for individual skills which in-turn determine premiums for the digital\nskills that matter most. This innovative approach helps HR professionals make\ninformed talent acquisition and rewards decisions for digital talent.\n\nThe solution will be introduced to clients in Hong Kong, Singapore, United\nKingdom and United States this year, with expansion to additional countries\nglobally in 2020.\n\nKeep up to date with industry news\n\nReceive our daily news straight to your inbox\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n  * [News](/news/all)\n  * [Directory](/directory/overview)\n  * [Pricing plans](/directory/price-plan)\n  * [Advertise](/advertise)\n  * [The Onrec Awards](/awards-categories)\n\n## Stay in touch\n\n  * [Twitter __](https://twitter.com/onrec)\n  * [Onrec LinkedIn Forum __](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=78676)\n  * [Contact us](/contact-us)\n\nOnrec\n\nOnrec is for HR Directors, Personnel Managers, Job Boards and Recruiters\nproviding them with information on the Internet recruitment industry such as\nindustry news, directory and events.\n\nE-mail:\n\n[info@onrec.com](mailto:info@onrec.com)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 ONREC.

The\nrace to improve operational efficiency and cut costs is forcing banks to adopt\nautomation whole-heartedly. Digitization could render some traditional job\nprofiles in the sector redundant, however, it could simultaneously fuel demand\nfor employees armed with new skill sets.\n\nAccording to a joint report by FICCI and NASSCOM, around 25 percent of the\nexisting jobs in the BFSI sector may face an existential crisis in the next\nthree years. However, another report by a human resources company paints a\nstarkly different picture. As per a report by TeamLease Services, the BFSI\nsector is expected to create 9 lakh new jobs by 2022.\n\nWhile the report seems to be contradictory, it is not, as the new jobs will be\ntechnology-focused, and the jobs facing an existential crisis are the legacy\njobs.\n\n### Technology Adoption\n\nThe peculiar situation of skills mismatch in the sector has risen after\nfinancial institutions chose to automate several core operations like risk\nmodelling, debt management, trade financing and equity analysis. Artificial\nIntelligence is being widely used for risk assessment and debt management. The\ntechnology has completely eliminated human interference and is able to predict\nthe risk profile of a customer within minutes. It has drastically cut down the\nadministrative and processing costs, along with the time taken for loan\ndisbursals. Similarly, digitization has transformed trade finance. Exporting\ncompanies, the primary recipients of trade finance, used to wait for days for\nthe process to be completed as it involved a lot of paperwork between\ndifferent countries. With the emergence of innovative financial technology\ncompanies, the process has been truncated, resulting in shorter turnaround\ntimes and lower costs.\n\n### New-Age Jobs\n\nRisk assessment and trade finance are just the tip of the iceberg, entire\ndepartments in banks are becoming redundant due to digitization. The\ntechnological advancement has spawned a new set of job profiles. Rapid\ntechnological adoption has led to a shortage of process modeller experts, data\nscientists, enterprise architect, client engagement managers, cybersecurity\nexperts and blockchain architects in the BFSI sector. Blockchain is another\ntechnology that holds immense promise for the sector. It is being used by the\nleading players to speed up settlements and secure transactions, boosting the\ndemand for blockchain experts.\n\n### The Rise of the Gig Economy\n\nThe gap in demand and supply for BFSI-focused jobs has coincided with another\nsignificant shift in the job market. The demand for independent freelance\nprofessionals with domain expertise has boomed in the country. In 2018-19,\nnearly 72 percent of all gig projects in the country were given by large\ncorporates as compared to 50 percent two years ago. Large companies in the\norganized sector are showing a preference for freelance professionals to fill\nup the gap in technical skills. Independent talent is being hired largely in\nthe marketing, finance and strategy verticals.\n\nCompanies in the BFSI sector, especially financial technology startups, are\nutilising independent professionals in roles such as data analytics, designing\ngrowth strategy, and financial modelling, and cybersecurity. However, the\nrequirements of the banking and finance sector are unique and cannot be\nfulfilled entirely by the gig economy.\n\nIf the internal movement within the sector is taken into consideration, the\nBFSI sector is likely to hire 4-5 lakh people every year for the next five\nyears, with the highest demand expected to be for sales and distribution\nroles. However, a variety of factors has constrained the supply of suitable\nemployees. Even though a large supply pool of employees is available, a lack\nof awareness, low interest in the BFSI sector and inadequate skills are the\nmajor factors that are inhibiting the hiring process. The skill gap is more\napparent in niche roles like data analytics, data scientist, risk management\nand industrial relations. The technology-fueled uncertainty and the resultant\nskill gap is deterring probable employees from entering the sector.\n\nRapidly rising demand for specialised job roles coupled with an equally short\nsupply of employees with the relevant skills is going to expand the demand-\nsupply gap. To avoid the impending crisis, financial institutions, employees\nand leading education service providers will have to collaborate on a large\nscale. A seamless collaboration can produce an adequate number of\nprofessionals with the relevant skill sets to drive the Indian BFSI sector\ninto the future.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Talent

New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\nDespite the finance function already being highly competitive and stressful,\n78% of Singaporean CFOs expect stress levels to go up over the next 3 years,\nfound a new research by [Robert\nHalf](https://www.roberthalf.com.sg/?utm_source=roberthalf&utm_medium=pressrelease&utm_campaign=rh-\nall-nonspecific-ongoing).\n\nIn a press statement to _Human Resources_ , the specialised recruitment firm\nrevealed the main causes of growing stress levels - increased workloads (56%),\nincreased business expectations (54%), shorter deadlines (40%) and a\ncompetitive marketplace (38%).\n\n**ALSO READ:** [59% would leave their jobs for a less stressful\none](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/59-leave-jobs-less-stressful-one/)\n\nThankfully, the overwhelming majority (94%) of Singaporean CFOs revealed that\nthey are taking measures to reduce stress in the workspace. These include\nencouraging staff to give feedback to management and offering flexible working\nhours or remote work opportunities (55%), and redesigning the office space to\nfacilitate better productivity and promote a more efficient working\nenvironment (51%).\n\nIn line with the research findings, Robert Half put together 8 ways to help\nemployers reduce or prevent workplace stress.\n\n**1\\. Motivate and reward employees  \n**Don\u2019t hold back on praise for a job well done. Feeling appreciated in the\nworkplace can further motivate staff which in turn can reduce workload\npressure.\n\n**2\\. Listen to employees**  \nMake sure there are open lines of communication for staff to discuss what is\ncausing them stress, then deliberate on how to reduce workplace stress and\nimplement action plans for improvement so that stressful situations can be\nmanaged better.\n\n**3\\. Address issues while they\u2019re fresh**  \nWorkplace conflicts and stressful situations rarely go away on their own.\nReach out to co-workers who may be demonstrating signs of stress and tension,\nand work through the issues together.\n\n**4\\. Be proactive with planning**  \nMap out day-to-day operations and new initiatives to let employees anticipate\nchallenges and organise their workflow more efficiently so potential stressful\nsituations can be avoided.\n\n**5\\. Assess training and technology needs**  \nLook for changes that could make internal processes more efficient, such as\nautomating manual procedures or upgrading computers. Spending less time on\nmanual processes and more time on value-adding projects can make the job more\nrewarding.\n\n**6\\. Revisit your corporate culture**  \nEmployees should feel respected and rewarded for their work. Consider if your\ncorporate culture focuses on commitment to success and employee wellbeing, or\nif it promotes a culture of embedded pressure and stress.\n\n**7\\. Take a break**  \nConsider thanking your team with a few stress-reducing perks, like a\nprofessional neck massage at the desk.\n\n**8\\. Demonstrate a commitment to work-life balance**  \nCreate work-life balance opportunities by embracing a variety of options such\nas flexible work hours and remote work opportunities.\n\n**READ MORE:** [Stress interviews: How far is too\nfar?](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/stress-interviews-how-far-is-too-\nfar/)\n\n**Matthieu Imbert-Bouchard, managing director of Robert Half Singapore** said:\n\u201cSingapore has a global reputation for business excellence, with finance\nprofessionals working in a highly competitive marketplace. Yet long working\nhours, higher workloads combined with shorter deadlines and increased business\nexpectations can cause stress levels to rise among Singapore\u2019s workforce. It\u2019s\nvital for the citystate\u2019s bosses to not only recognise growing stress levels\nwithin their workspaces, but to actively address it.\u201d\n\n\u201cStress is a drain not only on an employee\u2019s wellbeing but also on the\norganisation. Employees who are burned out or chronically frustrated and\nstressed are more prone to illness and absenteeism, and generally show signs\nof decreased morale which all negatively impact business productivity \u2013 hence\ncompany success.\u201d\n\n_Photo /[123RF](http://www.123rf.com/)_[ ](http://www.123rf.com/)\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

Tech and design skills are two of the\nfocus areas in terms of hiring.  \n\nAccording to a report in The Economic Times, Kotak Mahindra said that it would\nhire 2,600 freshers this year. Sukhjit Singh Pasricha, Kotak Mahindra Bank's\nchief human resource officer told the daily that they generally hire 2,500\nfresh graduates every year that account for a quarter of its total hiring. He\nsaid that around 60 per cent of fresh graduates are generally absorbed in\nfrontline acquisition roles, while 20 per cent are hired in service roles, 15\nper cent are hired in their in-house contact centre and the rest by operations\nand miscellaneous roles across segments.\n\nAxis Bank said that it would hire more than 2,300 fresh graduates. Out of\nthat, 2,000 would be for entry-level roles, around 200 from B-schools and a\nhundred from IITs and NITs. Rajkamal Vempati, HR head in Axis Bank said that\nthey are focussing on hiring in risk, compliance and cybersecurity roles. IT\nand analytics are also two of the key areas.\n\nThere has also been an increase in the demand for highly specialised talent in\nmultiple fields including analytics, digital banking, artificial intelligence\nand information security. There has also been a surge in demand for core\nbanking roles such as acquisition, relationship and service.\n\nPasricha also said that while availability is not a problem, mobility of the\nworkforce is extremely limited. He said that the millennial workforce also\nexpects to get into a strategic role right at the beginning of their career\nwithout any exposure to the ground realities of the industry.\n\n_**Also

But, on the ground, the story is different with a marked gap in\nthe supply and demand of skilled people.\n\n[![gif](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/2d86ed30-b282-11e8-b2e7-114aea10c711/800_4001568014076454.gif?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)](https://www.greatlearning.in/gl-\nacademy/enterprise?utm_source=yourstory&utm_medium=article-or-\nbanners&utm_campaign=b2b-lnd)\n\nCompanies are finding it hard to find talent with the [right tech\nskills](https://www.greatlearning.in/blog). This is true for India, as much as\nit is for the rest of the world. According to a recent study by online edtech\ncompany Great Learning, today there are 97,000 data science and analytics\npositions currently vacant across India due to dearth of qualified talent.\nThat number is estimated to grow in a couple of years. In fact, NITI Aayog's\nNational Strategy for Artificial Intelligence concurs that the country will\nhave a demand-supply gap of almost 200,000 data analysts in the next few\nyears.\n\n  \n\nAnd this has led to a dilemma for companies - should they look at skill\nacquisition or talent acquisition?\n\n###  **A tech talent war that is costing companies dearly**\n\nHR recruiters share that the race to find tech talent is so competitive that\nmost companies have no choice but to pay a premium to hire candidates. In\naddition, the hiring process itself involves costs - recruitment, advertising\nand other intermediary costs. And, once a hire is finalised, then there's the\ncost of induction and administrative training to help the new hire align with\nthe company's work practices and culture. In fact, according to WorkplaceInfo,\ncompanies are bearing recruitment expenses amounting to nearly 50 percent of a\nperson's first-year salary.\n\n  \n\nThe dearth of skills extends beyond the company to the existing talent pool in\nthe market. This means that there's a long gestation period to find and hire\ntalent with the right skill sets, leading to loss of productivity and\nestimated revenue.\n\n  \n\nThe other two key disadvantages of hiring as a solution to plug the skill gap\nis the possibility of making a wrong hire, leading to early resignations or\ndismissals and new hires becoming obsolete over time.\n\n  \n\nThis is not to dismiss the fact that hiring people with the latest technology\nskills in some cases might be inevitable. But it isn't sustainable in the long\nrun. At best, hiring is a short-term solution to enable companies to address\nthe immediate skill gap.\n\n  \n\nThis is why, many say, the answer lies in reskilling.\n\n###  **Why companies prioritise reskilling of home-grown talent**\n\nIt would be safe to say that reskilling is the best way to bolster the\nworkforce sustainably, irrespective of the hiring pipeline or requirement.\n\n  \n\nToday, a company's workforce is its biggest differentiator. This workforce\nshould be capable of constantly adapting to changes in the market so that the\ncompany can execute digital strategies that are in tune with advancements. The\nreality, however, is that unless it is championed by the organisation or a top\nleader, most employees hardly keep pace with the rapidly transforming digital\nadvancements. That's why businesses must reshape their talent strategy by\nleveraging skilling to improve employees' performance and technology.\n\n  \n\nThat said, upskilling and reskilling a company's internal talent pool is not\nonly a need but also the most practical talent strategy for businesses,\nconsidering the skill gap in the talent pool outside the organisation. For\none, employees are already in tune with the company culture, its vision and\ngoals, there is absolutely zero onboarding time and zero recruitment and\ninduction training costs. Second, it helps to build a skilled workforce at\nscale, who are ready for deployment in a short period of time.\n\n  \n\nA case in point is a leading Operations Management and Analytics company\noffering insurance, banking, financial services, utilities, healthcare,\ntravel, transportation and logistics services. In 2019, the company realised\nthat they needed over 400 qualified members in their workforce who could take\nthe company towards the next phase of growth. They also realised that they\nneeded to hire people who could hit the ground running immediately after they\njoined, otherwise they would not be able to hit their targets within agreed\ntimelines. The company saw reskilling and upskilling its current talent pool\nas the most practical and viable option.\n\n  \n\nThe company teamed up with Great Learning, and its employees underwent a\npersonalised learning experience that helped them learn concepts customised to\nthe company's needs and build skills that were holistic and relevant to their\nprofiles. At the end of the training period of nine weeks, the company not\nonly cut down on three months of job-training time, but also saved\napproximately Rs 12 crore which would have otherwise been spent on traditional\ntraining. The company also observed that the employees who underwent training\nwere much better skilled, enabling the company to command higher billing rates\nfor their services and thereby increase potential revenues by 2X.\n\n  \n\nThis is just one example that shows why organisations are seeing reskilling as\na smart and cost-effective strategy to plug the skill gap and as a growth\ndriver.\n\n###  **A multi-fold advantage**\n\nLet's talk about some of the other significant benefits of upskilling and\nreskilling the workforce - employee retention, employee engagement, a robust\ninternal talent pipeline, enhanced employee productivity and efficiency.\n\n  \n\nEmployees share that when organisations provide opportunities for upskilling,\nthey feel there's an increased level of job satisfaction, a sense of job\nsecurity and a clear career progression in the company. In fact, it is said\nthat training is one of the most effective ways of employee retention after\nsalary and incentives.\n\n  \n\nBut, employee retention is not only about saving costs. Happy employees are\nalso more confident and inclined towards taking on new projects that can bring\nvalue to the organisation. In fact, introducing new technical concepts and\nskills helps them embrace innovative thinking, master data-driven decision-\nmaking and do their jobs better and faster, regardless of their role or\nfunction in the company.\n\n  \n\nOrganisations that have reskilled their workforce have observed that the\nreskilled employees received promotions, while also reduced product\ndevelopment life cycle, accelerated time to revenue and significantly brought\ndown the time for development and project roll-out.\n\n  \n\nAlso, given that technology is ingrained in every aspect of the business\ntoday, tech literacy is no longer just for the tech workforce. When the non-\ntech workforce also gets tech skills, it paves the way for effective\ncommunication and stronger teamwork, leading to a more competitive and\nproductive organisation.\n\n###  **How to future-proof your workforce**\n\nToday, everyone understands that the traditional training doesn't cut it nor\ndo courses that are solely video-based. They focus too much on theory and do\nnot provide a clear pathway to learners on to how to leverage the new skills\nthat they have acquired.\n\n  \n\nThat's why companies are opting for a mix of rigorous training with learning\naids that reinforce what the employees have learnt. They are looking at\nspecialised skilling and online ed-tech partners who can tailor programmes\nthat help to build skills which are both holistic and at the same time\nrelevant to the employees' job profiles. For instance, one of the reasons why\na platform like Great Learning is sought after by global companies is that its\nlearning content is not only comprehensive but is also customised to the\ncompany's needs. In addition, the learning experience consists of self-paced\ncontent along with mentored learning sessions. For instance, in the case of an\nOperations Management and Analytics company, Great Learning included quizzes,\nassignments, projects, and hackathons to encourage a company's employees to\ncome up with novel solutions through the application of the concepts that\nthey've learnt.\n\n  \n\nIn another instance, a subsidiary of a global insurance and reinsurance\ncompany was looking to upskill its analytics and quality team to enable them\nto make accurate predictions of policy renewals and ensure that the revenue\nstream remained unaffected. The challenge was that the group was a mix of\ntechnical and non-technical professionals spread across different locations.\nGreat Learning teamed up with the company to design and execute a programme\nthat was customised to the unique needs of the company. The programme included\ncontemporary analytics trends that were being used by top companies, and was\nalso modified so that employees without technical experience were able to\nfollow the curriculum, while still being engaging and valuable to the\ntechnical professionals. In addition, a blended approach of an immersive\nclassroom-based methodology, along with live-streamed online programme\ndelivery for different locations was adopted. Participating in the programme\nenabled the employees to predict future insurance policy renewals with greater\naccuracy, and in turn the possibility of increasing the revenues\nsubstantially, while also reducing the human resource cost of having to hire\nspecialists.\n\n  \n\nIn short, today ed-tech startups like Great Learning make it possible to not\njust personalise skilling programmes, but also execute them at scale, making\nit easy for organisations to become digitally skilled.\n\n###  **It 's time**\n\nAccording to a recent NASSCOM report, nearly 40 percent of the estimated four\nmillion workforce in India across every major industry will need reskilling\nover the next five years to keep up with technology trends like automation,\ncloud computing, Big Data, analytics, and Machine Learning.\n\n  \n\nTo put it simply, if you are a business, it's time to upgrade your workforce.\n\n[![gif2](https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/2d86ed30-b282-11e8-b2e7-114aea10c711/Webp1568014302998.net-\ngifmaker_728_90?fm=png&auto=format&blur=500)](https://www.greatlearning.in/gl-\nacademy/enterprise?utm_source=yourstory&utm_medium=article-or-\nbanners&utm_campaign=b2b-lnd)\n\n  \n\n  \n\n**How has the coronavirus outbreak disrupted your life?

Indiantelevision.com hosted the first-ever Media HR Summit in\npartnership with ZEE in Mumbai on 26 June at The Westin. The day-long\nconference concluded with some insightful discussions around how corporate and\nHR leaders are steering media companies into the future on the back of good\nteams, HR analytics, diversity and inclusivity at the workplace.\n\nThe conference was divided into four sessions, three fireside chats and three\npresentations related to work culture, emerging trends in HR, employee\nengagement models, future-focused people strategies, changing nature of\nemployment amid the rapid changes in the media and entertainment industry.\n\nIndiantelevision.com founder, CEO and editor-in-chief Anil Wanvari set the\ntone for the day with his welcome note. He argued that the media and\nentertainment industry has never been full of so many opportunities. At the\nsame time, he added that it is facing challenges in terms of talent\nacquisition and retention. Wanvari pointed out that the human resources\ndepartment has never been given the due it deserves, highlighting the key\nreason behind the summit.\n\nFollowing the welcome address, Indiantelevision.com CEO moderated a session\ntitled \u201cResponding to megatrends\u201d.

All the panellists agreed that\ncompanies need personalised communication for millennial employees. However,\nas older generations also work at these companies, making a value proposition\nfor all the age groups was deduced as a challenge. Moreover, speakers stated\nthat. with the rapid change, HR has moved beyond a soft skill or a backend\nprocess. On the other hand, digital transformation is also affecting the\nsector and data is becoming more important day by day.\n\nThe next item on the agenda was a fireside between Shemaroo Entertainment Ltd\ndirector Jai Maroo and Wanvari. Shemaroo has been an excellent example of\nevolving over the years with new entrepreneurial ideas. While the company is\ngoing through a rigorous change, Maroo mentioned key winning traits every\ncompany needs to follow \u2013 putting people first including employee, vendor,\nclients; the ability to reinvent when needed; seeing where the company is\nstanding at the ecosystem, value chain. While it has unleashed a 5x\ntransformation plan, getting the HR team aligned with that is a key challenge.\n\n![](/sites/default/files/2_21.jpg)\n\nThat was followed by another interesting fireside chat between Discovery\nCommunications India South Asia managing director Megha Tata and Wanvari. Tata\nwho has been one of the few women leaders in the media and entertainment\nindustry outlined the reasons as to why women find it hard to shatter the\nglass ceiling. She noted that the ecosystem may not have been supportive of\nwomen who are rising through the ranks. The veteran media executive added that\nwomen also give up halfway through their journey due to various reasons.\n\n![](/sites/default/files/3_11.jpg)\n\nModerated by KPMG India people and change associate director Ajay Venkatesh,\nthe next session revolved around a very compelling topic \u2013 building a great\nteam. ABC Consultants FMCG, Internet, Media, and Development Sector director\nDeepika Ramani, Balaji Telefilms Ltd group head HR Ashish Pinto, Jagran Group\nhead HR Sagorika Kantharia, VATS Consulting founder Vikas Vats, and Saregama\nIndia Ltd general manager HR Sonalika Johri took part in the discussion.\n\n![](/sites/default/files/5_5.jpg)\n\nThe speakers articulated how different strokes should be used for different\nfolks while hiring. All the experts also agreed that agility and an analytical\nbent are having a big impact on business. However, companies also need to look\nat how they use the analytics, the panel said. While digital transformation is\nalready happening, cross-scaling talent is also important, concluded by the\nspeakers.\n\nThe conference further continued with a presentation by Publicis head HR\nNikhil Natekar on \u201cFuture focused people strategies\u201d. He spoke about cultural\nevolution, diversity inclusion, skill-based hiring and growth path for Gen Y\nwho are going to be future leaders. He then sat down for a chat with She means\nBusiness content creator and workshop facilitator Dipika Singh.\n\nVATS Consulting\u2019s Vikas Vats presented his thoughts on 'Future of Indian HR in\nthe Digital Age'. He highlighted that there are times when HRs need to work\nlike CEOs. He also added that while using technology is important, focusing on\npeople is more important.\n\nThe events of the day progressed with the session \u201cTackling the tech leap\u201d\nmoderated by HR Sampark founder and national president Ashish Banka.

The panelists agreed that adopting and\nadapting technologies is very important. While HR was late to join the party\nof analytics, now both AI and ML have emerged as key requirements for the HR\nindustry too. AI is now taking an active role in both hiring and firing.\nBelhekar and Save then gave a presentation on Artificial Intelligence in Human\nResources.\n\n![](/sites/default/files/4_7.jpg)\n\nThe day ended with a compelling session on \u201cDiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d.\nPart of the panel were Voices of Inclusion author Deepa Shankar, Mondelez\nInternational diversity and inclusion lead (independent consultant)\nPriyadarshini Gupta, NeoSeven Solutions global HR expert Monika Navandar, with\nD&I evangelist and founder and MD--Vividhataa, diversity hiring consultants\nRatanprabha Sable moderating the session. While diversity is not a big issue\nin the media industry, inclusion is a big piece that is being worked around,\nthe speakers said. The experts agreed that the media industry needs to be\ninclusive at little things. Moreover, the industry should also look at\ncreating job opportunities for disabled people, acid attack victims, and\nmental health patients was an important point that was voiced during the\nsession that kept the audience hooked on till the very end.\n\ntags\n\n[Media HR Summit](/keyword/media-hr-\nsummit)[Zee](/keyword/zee-3)[indiantelevision.com](/keyword/indiantelevisioncom-0)[work\nculture](/keyword/work-culture)[HR trends](/keyword/hr-\ntrends)[AI](/keyword/ai)[ML](/keyword/ml)[analytics](/keyword/analytics-0)\n\n#### Trending\n\n[![https://www.indiantelevision.com/sites/default/files/styles/230x230/public/images/tv-\nimages/2020/04/06/alt.jpg?itok=mToP0tQ3](https://www.indiantelevision.com/sites/default/files/styles/230x230/public/images/tv-\nimages/2020/04/06/alt.jpg?itok=mToP0tQ3)](/iworld/over-the-top-\nservices/altbalaji-partners-with-paypal-200406)\n\n##### [ALTBalaji partners with PayPal](/iworld/over-the-top-\nservices/altbalaji-partners-with-paypal-200406)\n\n###### [Admitad India comes forward to support daily wagers amid COVID-19\nlockdown](/mam/marketing/mam/admitad-india-comes-forward-to-support-daily-\nwagers-amid-covid-19-lockdown-200406)\n\n###### [Momspresso.com and Fevicreate launch #IndiaCraftingMemories\ninitiative](/mam/marketing/mam/momspressocom-and-fevicreate-launch-\nindiacraftingmemories-initiative-200406)\n\n###### [Crowdfunding platform Milaap launches campaign to fight\nCovid-19](/mam/marketing/mam/crowdfunding-platform-milaap-launches-campaign-\nto-fight-covid-19-200406)\n\n###### [Panasonic India's digital campaign crosses 100 million views on\nYouTube](/mam/marketing/mam/panasonic-indias-digital-campaign-\ncrosses-100-million-views-on-youtube-200406)\n\n\u0000\n\n#### Latest Reads\n\n[![https://www.indiantelevision.com/sites/default/files/styles/340x340/public/images/tv-\nimages/2020/04/07/the-ad-club-\nbangalore.jpg?itok=DVUMBEcL](https://www.indiantelevision.com/sites/default/files/styles/340x340/public/images/tv-\nimages/2020/04/07/the-ad-club-\nbangalore.jpg?itok=DVUMBEcL)](/mam/marketing/mam/advertising-world-should-re-\nstrategise-business-now-to-sustain-the-impending-economic-blow-200407)\n\n##### [Advertising world should re-strategise business now to sustain the\nimpending economic blow](/mam/marketing/mam/advertising-world-should-re-\nstrategise-business-now-to-sustain-the-impending-economic-blow-200407)\n\nNEW DELHI: The ongoing global lockdown prompted by the deadly COVID-19 has\npushed the world economy off a cliff, with even the most developed nations\nstaring into an impending dark phase of recession.
