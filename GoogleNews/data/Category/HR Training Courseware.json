Priya\nSunil\")\n\n## Why company-led training is a handy tool in the upskilling big picture\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/). Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\nThis article is brought to you by [Infocomm Media Development Authority\n(IMDA)](https://www.imda.gov.sg/).\n\n### _With tech talent in demand today, here 's how programmes such as\nTechSkills Accelerator (TeSA)'s Company-Led Training (CLT) help employers like\nTunity Technologies upskill their employees to build their tech pipelines._\n\nAccording to a [Michael Page report released in\n2019](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/hiring-and-salary-trends-for-\ntechnology-and-digital-talent-in-singapore-2019/), more employers in Singapore\nare seeking to hire roles such as data scientists, digital marketing managers,\nIT security leads, and marketing managers, placing these roles in greater\ndemand today.\n\nWith this trend set to only get more important, employers are putting greater\nemphasis on the professional development of their tech talent than ever\nbefore. A greater number of companies are thus taking steps to upskill and\nreskill their existing talent to meet these demands \u2014 in the form of\nleadership training, certifications, technical skills training, and more. [To\nfacilitate this training need](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/the-\nemployers-guide-to-unearthing-ict-talent-in-singapore/), several forward-\nthinking employers are stepping up to the challenge to build learning\necosystems.\n\nFor such employers, help is readily available - in the form of the [Company-\nLed Training (CLT)\nprogramme](https://www.imda.gov.sg/imtalent/programmes/clt), under the\n[TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA)\ninitiative](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/the-employers-guide-to-\nunearthing-ict-talent-in-singapore/). The CLT helps firms accelerate the tech\nskills of fresh to mid-level employees. It does so by providing support for\ntech talent to acquire competencies for in-demand tech jobs, especially for\nindustries that are undergoing digital transformation.\n\n### The ins and outs of company-led training\n\nTeSA is driven by Singapore\u2019s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA),\nwith the help of government agencies like Workforce Singapore (WSG) and\nSkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), in collaboration with the industry and the\nNational Trades Union Congress (NTUC). The initiative works to develop a\nskilled ICT workforce for Singapore and to enhance employability for\nindividuals.\n\nThe CLT programme enables employers to provide structured training to\nemployees, in line with [Singapore's ICT Skills\nFramework](https://www.imda.gov.sg/cwp/assets/imtalent/skills-framework-for-\nict/index.html). This includes the development of tech skills in new areas\nlike Artificial Intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT),\ndata analytics, blockchain, and more.\n\nCompanies can sign up to become training partners, providing training lasting\nup to 12 months through a combination of on-the-job training, job rotations,\nlocal and/or overseas attachment by industry partners, as well as in-depth\ntraining through internal and/or external courses. As partners, they will\nreceive funding support for qualified items such as monthly stipends for\ntrainees and fees for training or courseware development.\n\nAt the end of the training, trainees will be equipped with competencies for\ntech job roles in demand, aligned to the Skills Framework for ICT. Since its\nlaunch, the CLT programme has also been expanded to support digital leadership\ncapabilities development, which fulfils a demand for talent in one of the most\nup-and-coming sectors in Singapore.\n\nOne company that has benefitted from the CLT programme is [Tunity\nTechnologies](https://www.tunitytech.com/), a radio-frequency identification\n(RFID) solutions provider based in Singapore.\n\nOn the reason why the firm opted in for CLT, Lim Peck Hui, Managing Director,\nTunity Technologies _(pictured above, right)_ , says: \"\u201cTunity decided to\nundergo this programme because it not only supports our movement and passion\nto provide on-the-job RFID and IoT training (especially to employees who are\nnew to this industry), it also funds part of the hiring cost.\"\n\nOne of Tunity's staff who has undergone the programme is Zack Tan _(pictured\nabove, left)_ , who was hired by Tunity Technologies as a trainee of the CLT\nprogramme in May 2018.\n\nDuring the year-long programme, Zack benefited from on-the-job training and\nexposure while working on real-life cases. He was thus able to build up his\nknowledge and capabilities in programming, RFID and IoT technologies, and\nmore.\n\nIn fact, from someone who had no computer programming experience, Zack\nsuccessfully became an IoT software specialist at the end of the programme,\nwith the close guidance of the software team lead.\n\nLim affirms: \"\u201cFor a fresh graduate, his progress was certainly above average.\nHe was willing to work on numerous software-programming activities, starting\nfrom maintaining existing products to development of new projects.\n\n\"We guided him and provided him with the necessary support across the various\nteams, from software, sales to projects. We are happy to have been able to\nprovide Zack with the learning platform and opportunities during this one-year\nCLT programme. We are also grateful for the CLT grant support,\" she adds.\n\nFollowing this success, Lim urges other employers to consider enrolling in the\nprogramme as well, as she believes it opens up channels of candidates to\nfirms, allowing them to access a larger pool of talent.\n\n> ##### Besides, the programme is designed in a way that is a win-win\n> situation for both the employee and the employer. It provides employers with\n> the confidence to hire and try out candidates from different industries.\n\nIt also gives employees the chance to test out working at the particular\ncompany or industry they\u2019ve joined, to see if it is a good fit for them, she\nadds. \"Most practically, it pays companies to try out new candidates and see\nif they fit the organisation,\" she concludes, building a case for employers to\nopt in for company-led training as a viable path to upskilling new employees.\n\n_Photo / from L-R: Tunity Technologies ' team, Zack Tan and Lim Peck Hui_\n\n[Hong Kong HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-resilience-and-\nwellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\n**27th March** Strengthening the mental resilience and wellbeing of employees\n-  \nimproving employee engagement, talent retention and organisational\nproductivity.  \n[Register now here](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-\nresilience-and-wellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\nBack to Top\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/10115912/Aditi-Jan-2020-lgbtiq-medical-benefits-\ndiversity-123rf-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Previous Article:\n\n[Indian startup Acko extends medical benefits to partners of LGBTIQ\nemployees](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/indian-startup-acko-extends-\nmedical-benefits-to-partners-of-lgbtiq-employees/)\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/13095251/rubik_this_one-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Next Article:\n\n[3 AI tips that are crucial to talent\nacquisition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/3-ai-tips-that-are-crucial-\nto-talent-acquisition/)\n\n# Read More News\n\n06/05/2014 Thu 11:46 AM in China by [Sabrina\nZolkifi](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/sabrinaz/ \"Posts by\nSabrina Zolkifi\")\n\n## [Survey: 20% of women report sexual harassment at\nwork](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/office-sexual-harassment-reporting/\n\"Survey: 20% of women report sexual harassment at work\")\n\nYet one third of employees who claim to have experienced sexual harassment in\nHong Kong have not reported it. ..\n\n07/11/2019 Thu 10:07 AM in China by [Robert\nBlain](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/robertb/ \"Posts by Robert\nBlain\")\n\n##\n[\u61f7\u67d4\u653f\u7b56\uff1a\u5177\u91dd\u5c0d\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u50f1\u54e1\u798f\u5229\u5f85\u9047](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/%e6%87%b7%e6%9f%94%e6%94%bf%e7%ad%96%ef%bc%9a%e5%85%b7%e9%87%9d%e5%b0%8d%e6%80%a7%e7%9a%84%e6%9c%89%e6%95%88%e5%83%b1%e5%93%a1%e7%a6%8f%e5%88%a9%e5%be%85%e9%81%87/\n\"\u61f7\u67d4\u653f\u7b56\uff1a\u5177\u91dd\u5c0d\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u50f1\u54e1\u798f\u5229\u5f85\u9047\")\n\n\u4eba\u529b\u8cc7\u6e90\u4eba\u54e1\u5982\u4f55\u5584\u7528\u85aa\u916c\u798f\u5229\u4f5c\u70ba\u52dd\u51fa\u4eba\u624d\u6230\u7684\u6b66\u5668..\n\n09/23/2016 Fri 11:21 AM in All markets by [Jerene\nAng](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/jerenea/ \"Posts by Jerene\nAng\")\n\n## [Former branch manager of Cisco (M) jailed and fined for false\nclaims](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/former-branch-manager-cisco-m-\njailed-fined-false-claims/ \"Former branch manager of Cisco \\(M\\) jailed and\nfined for false claims\")\n\nAgu Salim Saibi, 55, was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and fined about\nRM200,000 for making false claims totaling RM40,021.2..\n\n10/30/2015 Fri 13:05 PM in Africa by [Jerene\nAng](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/jerenea/ \"Posts by Jerene\nAng\")\n\n## [Up the ranks: Gaurav Hirey is Millward Brown's new regional\nCHRO](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/ranks-millward-browns-new-chro-\nafrica-middle-east-asia-pacific/ \"Up the ranks: Gaurav Hirey is Millward\nBrown\u2019s new regional CHRO\")\n\nGaurav Hirey brings with him more than 20 years of HR leadership experience,\nwill be based in Singapore in his new role...\n\n04/17/2013 Wed 17:08 PM in Singapore by\n[Contributor](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/contributor/ \"Posts\nby Contributor\")\n\n## [The changing landscape of\nlearning](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/changing-landscape-learning/\n\"The changing landscape of learning\")\n\nLike the rest of HR, the L&D; function is rapidly evolving.

Thu 10:07 in All markets by [Heather\nAng](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/heathera/ \"Posts by Heather\nAng\")\n\n## Why design thinking is so important for HR leaders today\n\nHuman Resources magazine and the HR Bulletin daily email newsletter:  \nAsia's only regional HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\n### _Developed in the 1950s,[design thinking is an action-oriented and human-\ncentric framework](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/everything-you-need-\nto-know-about-design-thinking/) for problem solving. Implemented effectively,\nit has been credited to lower risks and costs, gain employee buy-in, drive\ngrowth, and gain market share._\n\n### _In this interview with_ Rohit Manucha _, international OD and C &B\nexpert, we find out why this innovative way of problem solving is coming to\nthe forefront, in a world where the line between external and internal\n(employees) customers is blurring._\n\n### Q Why is design thinking becoming so important for HR today, when it\nwasn't as popular previously?\n\nDesign thinking has been in a way, a part of the organisation behaviour\ncourseware since the late 1950s century, coming into the fore around 1969-73\nas an innovative way of problem solving, hence it\u2019s not a new concept. Its\nroots reach across individual, team, intergroup and organisation (i.e.\norganisational behaviour ecosystem) covering elements of:\n\n  * Organisation design, which is the framework on which all the structure, processes and systems are built aligned with the strategy, and;\n  * Organisation development, which is the increment rectification in efficacy of the design aspects within an organisation, through the talent.\n\nDesign thinking within HR has been brought into predominance of late, with\norganisations realising that the line between their customers and employees is\nblurring, resulting in a seamless talent-customer pool. Thereby, employees are\nnow rightly expecting the same \u2018experience\u2019 as an employee, as what they\nreceived as a customer, and organisations need to cater to this new reality.\n\nFurthermore, design thinking (i.e. empathise-define-ideate-prototype-test) has\nan increased relevance in the VUCA world organisations operate in, as it\ncomplements the project-based structure of organisations and enables them to\ninnovate, take calculated risks, and undertake quick implementation.\n\n### Q What does OD essentially entail for the modern organisation?\n\nOrganisation design & development for an organisation entails a constant\njourney of self-discovery. The usually flow ranges from understanding the\norganisation\u2019s present (as-is); identifying the future state (to-be); listing\nthe gaps to be addressed and opportunities to be leveraged; and freezing/un-\nfreezing/re-freezing structures, systems, policies and processes in order to\nallow the key talent to attain that future state for the organisation.\n\nNow when an organisation begins to do this from the perspective of an employee\n(being in their shoes), it then begins to empathetically link people\nexperience to design thinking.\n\n> ##### The usual belief surrounding OD interventions is that they are hard to\n> do, costly, involve multiple man-hours, and require continuous\n> communication.\n\n### Q Why is it so hard to lead OD interventions, or is that more of a myth?\n\nThe usual belief surrounding OD interventions is that they are hard to do,\ncostly, involve multiple man-hours, require continuous communication, and are\nfollowed by a long-drawn change management intervention post implementation.\n\nAlso the valid fear that plagues everyone\u2019s mind is that should an\norganisation get its OD intervention wrong, this would send it down a very\nslippery slope which in most cases can be hard to recover from.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that an effective OD intervention delivered by a\nseasoned OD practitioner gives back to an organisation many times over and\nthere are plenty of examples proving that.\n\n### Q What skills does an effective OD practitioner require?\n\nJust as a healthcare professionals know how to isolate the symptoms from the\nproblem and then treat the root cause with accurate prescription; an OD\npractitioner needs to know which tools and techniques to use to diagnose,\npropose, test and implement the OD interventions.\n\nWithout proper management buy-in and stakeholder alignment this journey\nbecomes hard.\n\nAs Abraham Lincoln once said \u201cGive me six hours to chop down a tree and I will\nspend the first four sharpening the axe\u201d, an OD practitioner needs to ensure\nadequate pre-work/research is done prior to implementation and adequate post\nimplementation support is provided.\n\nFor any OD intervention to be successful one must consider the\ninterdependencies amongst various sub-elements of\nculture/structure/system/policy/ process/ people. My favourite analogy to\nexplain this is to consider yourself throwing a pebble in a lake; no matter\nhow small, it will always create ripples.\n\nMy upcoming masterclass is designed to not only equip participants with\nadequate skills pertaining to the use of OD tools and techniques but also to\nrun them through case studies, role plays which simulate working conditions\nacross teams/ functions.\n\nIt would also help participants explore their \u2018self-awareness\u2019 and \u2018blind\nspots\u2019 to help them in identifying their strengths and weaknesses better so\nthat they can accordingly enhance their behavioural competencies and become a\nholistic, truly effective OD practitioner.\n\n* * *\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/26100041/TrainerPhoto_RohitManucha-180x180.jpg)\n\n\n\n_The author, Rohit Manucha, is an international OD and C &B expert based in\nDubai.

The home improvement giant wasn't finding [the right\ncandidates](https://searchaws.techtarget.com/tip/IT-skills-shortage-leads-to-\nAWS-certification-demand) \\-- or at least not enough of them -- to fill its\nopen IT positions. The company tried several approaches to attract the right\ntalent.\n\n\"We tried traditional means, working with external campuses and offering\nweeklong curricula in our offices,\" said Anthony Gregorio, director of\ntechnology enablement and enterprise architecture at Home Depot, based in\nAtlanta. \"That got us some short-term, incremental changes in skills, but we\nreally needed continuous learning to move forward.\"\n\nOne approach that had some success was hiring people who had recently\ncompleted an intensive tech boot camp by a private company that Gregorio said\ncovered the full stack of software Home Depot uses.\n\nBut those tech boot camps [don't necessarily graduate enough qualified\ncandidates](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/news/252469463/IT-\ntraining-programs-stall-amid-search-for-best-practices). While programming,\ndata analysis and other relevant skills are taught, they aren't necessarily\nteaching how to use the software and techniques in the way Home Depot wants it\nto be taught.\n\nAccording to Gregorio, CIO Matt Carey came up with the idea of bringing the\ntech boot camp in-house. Gregorio and two other Home Depot managers spoke at\nthe [2019 Pluralsight Live\nconference](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/news/live-2019-ultimate-recap),\nwhich was hosted by Pluralsight, a provider of IT training, courseware and\ncertification programs used by many enterprises, including Home Depot.\n\n### __A separate organization\n\nTo make the tech boot camp a unique entity, with its own goals and reporting\nstructure, Home Depot created OrangeMethod, a training program that offers IT\ntraining for current employees looking to up their skills, as well as training\nfor [new employees](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/7-steps-to-\nimprove-the-onboarding-process-for-new-hires).\n\nThe idea was to make sure new employees had resources from day one. At the\nconference, a number of hands in the audience went up when Gregorio asked how\nmany times a new employee started at their company only to find there was no\nlaptop or computer ready for them. With OrangeMethod now a part of the\nemployee onboarding process, they can ensure all necessary tools and resources\nare readily available.\n\nThere are also no tuition charges for the courses. \"In fact, we paid them,\"\nGregorio said. \"Their salaries and roles at the company are never impacted by\ntheir participation. We've made a full commitment to learning that is\ndramatically different for a brick-and-mortar retailer.\"\n\nOrangeMethod started with a focus on software engineering, but has since\nbranched out into other areas, including [training on\nUX](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/tip/How-to-develop-a-UX-\nworkflow) and product management. There are currently 40 full-time associates\nat OrangeMethod, whose job is to train current and new employees participating\nin the program. With Atlanta established, Home Depot has added a second\nOrangeMethod center in Austin, Texas.\n\n### __From cashier to HR manager\n\nParticipation is not automatic -- there's an application process, followed by\ninterviews facilitated [by the HR\ndepartment](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/feature/HR-and-IT-better-\ntogether).\n\n\"We have many amazing stories. In fact, I started as a cashier,\" said\nChristina Mehr, senior manager of HR for technology at Home Depot. \"As the\nprogram got started and word spread, we've been getting cool emails from\nleaders in finance and other departments who wanted to learn more.\"\n\nMehr said working with Pluralsight has also helped Home Depot offer a range of\nlearning options, from classroom to self-paced instruction guides.\n\n\"If, say, you want to become a super pro at Java, not everyone learns the same\nway. So, we're able to offer workshops or a way for self-starters to learn on\ntheir own.  We're constantly figuring out ways to support the workforce,\" she\nsaid.\n\n### __Making digital transformation work\n\nGeorge Boone, senior manager at OrangeMethod, said the company's first tech\nboot camp in 2017 was a 12-week course for tech-oriented employees who\nupgraded their skills.\n\n\"Over time, we realized, hey, we have over 400,000 people at this company, and\na lot of them may want to be software engineers, but they're hidden behind\ntitles that won't allow it,\" Boone said. \"[Digital\ntransformation](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/feature/Build-a-digital-\ntransformation-strategy-with-software-at-its-core) discounts the human element\nof humans driving change. You have to keep up with technology, but you also\nhave to move people along with it.\"\n\n> Digital transformation discounts the human element of humans driving change.\n> You have to keep up with technology, but you also have to move people along\n> with it.  **George Boone** Senior manager at OrangeMethod  __\n\nFor Home Depot, the program has been the proverbial win-win.\n\n\"They are bringing us more value than we are to them, because they are in the\nstores, they know the customer pain points and they know our systems,\" Boone\nsaid. \"When you add someone like that to a product team, it's an immediate\nwin.\"\n\nThe latest iteration of the tech boot camp is a 16-week course that employees\ncan use to become UX managers or software engineers. There are also follow-up\nrecaps and courses on more specific topics.\n\nLastly, one of the key factors to the program's success has been the\ninvolvement of the HR department.\n\n\"We are changing people's lives, but we wouldn't have been successful without\nthe [partnership with HR](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/news/450403725/HR-\npartnership-key-to-combatting-IT-talent-shortage),\" Boone said.  \n\n####  __Dig Deeper on Leadership and strategic planning\n\n  * [\n\n##### Pluralsight Skills & Flow: product lines now feature GitPrime developer\nproductivity\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/Adrian-Bridgwater-60px.jpg)\nBy: Adrian Bridgwater ](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/CW-Developer-\nNetwork/Pluralsight-Skills-Flow-product-lines-now-feature-GitPrime-developer-\nproductivity)\n\n  * [\n\n##### The \u2018opportunity divide\u2019 in the tech job disconnect\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/Adrian-Bridgwater-60px.jpg)\nBy: Adrian Bridgwater ](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/CW-Developer-\nNetwork/The-opportunity-divide-in-the-tech-job-disconnect)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Pluralsight LIVE 2019: keynote notes, quotes & anecdotes\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/Adrian-Bridgwater-60px.jpg)\nBy: Adrian Bridgwater ](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/CW-Developer-\nNetwork/Pluralsight-LIVE-2019-keynote-notes-quotes-anecdotes)\n\n  * [\n\n##### What to expect from Pluralsight LIVE 2019\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/Adrian-Bridgwater-60px.jpg)\nBy: Adrian Bridgwater ](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/CW-Developer-\nNetwork/What-to-expect-from-Pluralsight-LIVE-2019)\n\n  * [![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/needle_david.jpg)](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/David-Needle)\n\n[David Needle](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/David-Needle) asks:\n\n## What type of process has your company implemented for hiring and training\nIT professionals?\n\n__\n\nJoin the Discussion\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [A New Security Strategy that Protects the Organization When Work Is Happening ...](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/A-New-Security-Strategy-that-Protects-the-Organization-When-Work-Is-Happening-from-Anywhere) -Citrix\n  * [Why IT Must Break Down Silos as Part of its Digital Transformation Initiative](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/Why-IT-Must-Break-Down-Silos-as-Part-of-its-Digital-Transformation-Initiative) -Citrix\n  * [How IT and HR can Partner to Deliver a Better Employee Experience](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/How-IT-and-HR-can-Partner-to-Deliver-a-Better-Employee-Experience) -Citrix\n  * [See More](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/sponsored_communities)\n\n__Related Content\n\n  * [Boot Camp](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Boot-Camp) - WhatIs.com\n  * [Is a hard-driving developer boot camp right for you?](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/news/4500277448/Is-a-hard-driving-developer-boot-camp-right-for-you) - SearchSoftwareQuality\n  * [Image Builder makes it easy to manage vSphere Auto ...](https://searchvmware.techtarget.com/tip/Image-Builder-makes-it-easy-to-manage-vSphere-Auto-Deploy-images) - SearchVMware\n\n####  __Join the conversation\n\n###  __ 2 comments\n\nSend me notifications when other members comment.

Naturally, organizations and\nemployees that have a higher level of digital dexterity are more likely to\nmake the most of new ways of working. Several factors, like organizational\nagility, workplace culture, leadership priorities, long-term vision, and a\nwillingness to experiment, contribute to an organization\u2019s digital dexterity.\n\nHowever, despite the importance of being ready for the future and being\ndigitally dexterous, research suggests that organizations are struggling to\nbuild digital capacities. For example, one\n[study](https://www.capgemini.com/fi-en/news/organizations-struggle-to-make-\nprogress-with-their-digital-transformation-investments/) found the overall\nreadiness for digital transformation in companies has declined from 2012 to\n2018. Similarly, [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/executive-\nguidance/digital-dexterity) found that 83 percent of leaders struggle to make\nmeaningful progress on digital transformation, and merely [7 to 18\npercent](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-\nreleases/2018-06-20-gartner-says-too-few-organizations-have-the-digital-\ndexterity-to-adopt-new-ways-of-work-solutions) of organizations around the\nworld possess digital dexterity.\n\n### The role of talent in building digital dexterity\n\nOne of the primary reasons why organizations are lagging behind is because of\nlack of leadership vision aligned to a digital future. Even in organizations\nwhere leaders are well-acquainted with digital trends, they fail to make the\nmost of them owing to a dearth in the talent needed to help organizations\nexcel in the digital age. This widening talent gap has disrupted the talent\npipeline and induced a never-ending war for quality talent.\n\nFaced with a limited talent supply, organizations will have to nurture\ndigitally dexterous employees internally. These employees must be chosen\ncarefully. In addition to bringing their domain expertise to the table, they\nwill also have to be well-versed with the knowledge and skills needed to\ntransform disciplines across the organizations. Organizations need to empower\nemployees to have conversations around choosing the right digital tools and\nhow to use them effectively to drive growth. Employees, on the other hand,\nneed to learn how to design new business and workplace models with digital\nbeing an integral part of the process, alongside innovating existing\noperations and offerings.\n\n### How to develop digital dexterity?\n\nDeveloping digital dexterity in an organization requires reimagining how we\nhave been undertaking skilling and training so far. We need a tremendous\namount of collaboration and coordination throughout the organization to\ndevelop mission-driven teams that are goal-oriented and follow the values and\nbeliefs of the organization. A few factors include having clear goals and\nprojects, incentives-based on skills and abilities, minimal hierarchies, free\nflow of information and feedback, and high levels of trust and transparency.\nHere are a few other vital strategies to successfully develop digital\ndexterity in your organization:\n\n**Digital basics and strategy:** Begin by training teams and leaders about the\ntechnologies that already exist and how they are relevant to the organization,\nemployees, and customers. Help them identify and understand new digital tools\nand technologies that could deliver maximum value; this will help in\nredesigning and reinventing traditional business models to include a stronger\ndigital dimension.\n\n**Focus on key elements of digital transformation:** Train your employees on\nall critical aspects of digital transformation along with a combination of\ntechnical and behavior-based topics. These include, but are not limited to\ndisruptive technologies, like automation and AI; data sciences, like data\nvisualization and big data; agile methodologies and culture; social media\nmarketing; computational thinking; cross-functional collaboration and\ncontinuous learning.\n\n**Learner-centered training:** Ensure that the training builds relevant\nessential capabilities for today and tomorrow so that learners can experience\nan immediate impact on their work and jobs. Such training should ideally\nleverage personalized learning tools, use consumer-grade UX to keep learners\nengaged, support micro-learning, offer learning flexibility, and provide the\nlearner with the best-in-class collection of assets and knowledge sources.\n\n**Invest in leadership development:** The importance of making leaders\ndigitally dexterous cannot be emphasized upon enough. Leaders and managers\nneed more support and assistance in the form readily accessible training,\nresources, programs and tools that not only help them develop traditional\nleadership skills (like how to lead teams through a challenge) but also more\ncontemporary skills (like how to build agile leadership). Furthermore, the\ndefinition of what constitutes leadership must expand to include shared\nleadership, wherein anyone who makes the best use of the training provided can\nbe a leader.\n\n**Measure and evaluate:** Finally, make sure that there ares data and\nanalytics to keep track of the progress made from all the interventions.\nDevelop robust feedback mechanisms and enable learners to interact with others\nand collaborate in their learning journey.\n\nHistory has shown that organizations that have failed to transform digitally\nhave lost out on the advantages and even gone out of business. The future\nbelongs to those who are creating new offerings and models as per the need to\nnot just survive but thrive in a disruptive world. Digital dexterity is a\ncrucial part of this equation, and employers, leaders, and managers cannot\nafford to fall behind.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [HR Technology](/category/hr-technology/hr-\ntechnology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hr-technology \"Browse more in:\nHR Technology\"), [#GetSetLearn](/tag/get-set-\nlearn?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=get-set-learn \"Browse more in:\nGetSetLearn\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Manav Seth](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1452578431/authors/manav-\nseth.jpg)](/author/manav-seth)\n\n#### [Manav Seth](/author/manav-seth)\n\nManav Seth is a freelance writer at People Matters.\n\n[NEXT STORY: How JSW Steel leveraged e-learning to accelerate women careers\n](https://www.peoplematters.in/blog/training-development/how-jsw-steel-\nleveraged-e-learning-to-accelerate-women-careers-21416?page=2 \"Blog: How JSW\nSteel leveraged e-learning to accelerate women careers &ndash; People\nMatters\")\n\n### TRENDING STORIES\n\n[ ![L&D\u2019s role in supporting digital\ntransformation](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_220,h_124,c_thumb,q_auto,f_auto/v1578434342/1578434341.jpg)\n](/article/training-development/lds-role-in-supporting-digital-\ntransformation-24242 \"L&D\u2019s role in supporting digital transformation\")\n\n##  [L&D\u2019s role in supporting digital transformation](/article/training-\ndevelopment/lds-role-in-supporting-digital-transformation-24242)\n\n[ ![These are the top learning consumption trends in\ntechnology](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_220,h_124,c_thumb,q_auto,f_auto/v1578911831/1578911829.jpg)\n](/article/training-development/these-are-the-top-learning-consumption-trends-\nin-technology-24244 \"These are the top learning consumption trends in\ntechnology\")\n\n##  [These are the top learning consumption trends in\ntechnology](/article/training-development/these-are-the-top-learning-\nconsumption-trends-in-technology-24244)\n\n[ ![Skills development priorities for the digital\nage](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_220,h_124,c_thumb,q_auto,f_auto/v1578435360/1578435358.jpg)\n](/article/skilling/skills-development-priorities-for-the-digital-age-24245\n\"Skills development priorities for the digital age\")\n\n##  [Skills development priorities for the digital\nage](/article/skilling/skills-development-priorities-for-the-digital-\nage-24245)\n\n[ ![Here\u2019s how to secure your employees against new-age digital\nthreats](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_220,h_124,c_thumb,q_auto,f_auto/v1578434911/1578434909.jpg)\n](/article/employee-relations/heres-how-to-secure-your-employees-against-new-\nage-digital-threats-24243 \"Here\u2019s how to secure your employees against new-age\ndigital threats\")\n\n##  [Here\u2019s how to secure your employees against new-age digital\nthreats](/article/employee-relations/heres-how-to-secure-your-employees-\nagainst-new-age-digital-threats-24243)\n\n[ ![People Matters Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/h_88,w_188,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/Logo-2.0-b.png) ](/)\n\n#### Categories\n\n  * __[Strategy](/category/leadership-strategy)\n  * __[Recruitment](/category/recruitment)\n  * __[Performance](/category/compensation-performance)\n  * __[Culture](/category/organizational-culture)\n  * __[Tech](/category/technology-outsourcing)\n  * __[Life](/category/watercooler-sports-entrepreneurship)\n  * __[L&D](/category/training-and-development)\n  * __[HR Technology](/category/hr-technology)\n  * __[HRO](/category/hr-outsourcing)\n  * __[HR Consulting](/category/consulting)\n  * __[Rewards](/category/benefits-and-rewards)\n  * __[Leadership](/category/leadership)\n  * __[Assessment](/category/assessment)\n\n#### Company\n\n  * __[About Us](/about-us)\n  * __[Privacy Policy](/privacy-and-policy)\n  * __[Terms of Use](/terms-and-conditions)\n  * __[Careers](/careers)\n  * __[Advertise with Us](/advertise)\n  * __[Become a Sponsor](/sponsor)\n\n#### Contact\n\n  * __[Contact Us](/about-us?section=contact)\n  * __[Feedback](/about-us?section=feedback)\n  * __[Submission Guidelines](/submission-guidelines)\n\n#### Follow Us:\n\n  * [ ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDH4bXLnQ5_-HasjJsP2Dew \"Subscribe to Youtube for latest videos\")\n  * [ ](https://www.facebook.com/PeopleMatters \"Subscribe on Facebook for latest stories\")\n  * [ ](https://www.twitter.com/PeopleMatters2 \"Follow on Twitter for latest activities\")\n  * [ ](https://www.linkedin.com/company/people-matters \"Connect on LinkedIn for latest offerings and carriers\")\n  * [ ](https://plus.google.com/b/111891526232191870519/ \"Follow on Google+ for latest stories and events updates\")\n  * [ ](https://www.instagram.com/peoplematters/ \"Follow on Instagram for latest gallery of events\")\n\nCopyright 2020 People Matters Media Pvt.

Specifically in the Asia Pacific region, businesses are adopting\nadvanced AI faster than their counterparts in the rest of the world. According\nto a recent study, 22% of companies in APAC are at advanced stages of machine\nlearning deployments against just 7% in Europe and 11% in North America.\nClearly, companies in Asia Pacific are ahead in driving business improvements\nby integrating AI technology in their functions.\n\nAI-generated innovation is fostering optimism across the region. In the\nworkplace and across departments, it has matured into a catalyst that has\nhelped improve employee efficiency and wellbeing. It\u2019s establishing a new work\natmosphere where human capital resources co-exist with robots or digital\nassistants and where the primary benefits encompass improved productivity,\nefficiency and profitability.\n\n **Growing positivity for AI in the workplace**\n\nFor decades AI has aroused both fear and excitement. Mostly, there has been\nwidespread fear of the possibilities of increased unemployment on account of\nworkplace automation. However, in reality, APAC perception towards AI in the\nworkplace has shifted more positively as more and more people developed a\nbetter understanding of AI and its applicability in the workplace to manage\nproductivity.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by Oracle and human-resources advisory and\nresearch firm, Future Workplace, 80% of APAC countries surveyed said more than\n50% of their workers are currently using some form of AI in the workplace.\nMore specifically, 77% of workers in China and 78% of workers in India have\nadopted AI, which are more than double the 32% in France and 38% in the United\nKingdom.\n\nMoreover, 64% of people surveyed said they trust robots more than their\nmanagers, with geographic findings ranging from as high as 90% in India, 88%\nin China and 84% in Singapore. The study also revealed that APAC markets are\napproaching the future of AI in the workplace with readiness and excitement,\nranking these attributes higher than feelings of concern, fear, uncertainty or\nindifference.\n\n **Delivering smart, intuitive, informed HR to support the business directly**  \nThe rising affinity toward AI has increased its adoption in specialized\nbusiness functions \u2013 take HR for example. As businesses become more complex\nand the need to hire resources with sophisticated, modern skills grows, the\nwar for talent is mounting. HR departments have begun to use AI to optimize\nboth their recruitment functions and back-end processes, thereby boosting\nhigher levels of efficiency and performance.\n\nIn APAC specifically, 76% of talent acquisition professionals cite they are\nalready using AI as a sourcing tool since it generates higher-quality\ncandidates in order to stop unconscious biases and ensure an equitable hiring\nprocess. For example, HR departments are now starting to deploy AI in their\nrecruitment processes, to help them, screen candidates, by assessing copious\ndata points objectively while even being programmed to ignore candidates\u2019\ndemographic information. In fact, the Oracle and Future Workplace study found\nthat in APAC, up to 53% of people think robots can provide unbiased\ninformation and feedback \u2013 better than managers.\n\nFurthermore, automation of more manual tasks through AI allows HR managers to\nfocus their time on more strategic assignments such as attracting, developing\nand retaining top talent. By employing AI-powered human capital management\ntechnologies, HR managers can harness valuable data-driven insights on\nemployees and their training and career development needs. This enables HR\npractitioners to execute faster, smarter business decisions and keep up with\nfast-paced market demands and changes.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some examples. Save The Children, one of India\u2019s leading\nindependent children rights non-profit organizations, is using Oracle HCM\nCloud to maintain a database of global resources, which can be used to enable\nSave The Children to deploy the right resources for projects and to support\nchildren beneficiaries. This capability is most critical during emergencies\nwhen there is an urgent need for a resource, like being able to identify a\nhealth specialist in a city plagued by floods using the AI-enabled database.\n\nThen there is Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation (MFTBC) that\ndeployed Oracle HCM Cloud to address their struggling inefficiencies in HR\noperations. Today, the company is able to successfully manage the employee\ngoals, assessments and incentives of over 10,000 employees. They have been\nable to standardize and streamline HR processes better, such as managing\npersonnel information, career development, manpower planning, and ultimately\nimproving employee performance and productivity.\n\n **Preparing the workforce for the future AI world**  \nGiven AI\u2019s multifarious benefits to the workforce and HR managers, AI is here\nto stay. However, according to the study by Oracle and Future Workplace, 76%\nof employees and 81% of HR leaders find it challenging to keep up with the\npace of technological changes in the workforce. These numbers are higher in\nChina (96%) and India (93%). One way to bridge the gap of the rapid\nadvancement in technology with employee preparedness is to support the\nupskilling and re-skilling of employees. It\u2019s important for organizations to\nacknowledge the need to invest in new skills development so they remain\nrelevant in the workforce.\n\nAs AI continue to change the role of employees and managers at work, one of\nthe most critical ways that managers can upskill to remain relevant is by\nfostering stronger relationships with their staff and excelling in areas where\ntechnology falls short. By embracing aspects of emotional intelligence, such\nas personalizing the experience to reflect their reports individually,\nproviding coaching for employees and creating a conducive work culture, while\nsimultaneously striving for objectivity, human managers can work in tandem\nwith their AI counterparts, without becoming \u201cobsolete\u201d.\n\n**Fully embracing AI as a job augmenter**  \nIn today\u2019s digital economy, AI is becoming so prevalent that the MIT\nTechnology Review predicts it will impact one in five jobs in APAC by 2024,\neliminating one in eight, but more importantly, enhancing many as well.\n\nDenying the impact of the AI revolution in the workplace is no longer an\noption. Everyone across an organization \u2013 be it entry-level associates or\nmanagers and senior executives, and HR professionals \u2013 should welcome AI as a\nvital tool that will enhance business productivity, employee wellbeing, and\nrecruitment processes.\n\nDisclaimer: _The views expressed in the article above are those of the\nauthors' and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of this\npublishing house_\n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n[workplaces](/tags/workplaces-7694/) [artificial\nintelligence](/tags/artificial-intelligence-520/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

While the latter two may be done solely\nthrough on-the-job learning and mentoring; to introduce new knowledge, the\ndesign typically starts with formal training and uses mentoring and informal\nlearning to support and enable new behaviours.\n\nShould introducing new knowledge be your goal, the type of programme is\ncrucial. Here are some tips to get you started.\n\n### Start by identifying the employee\u2019s needs\n\nFirst things first: know what your employee wants (and needs). This can be\ndone either through formal development conversations with staff or through\ninformal catch-up meetings. During these conversations, ask questions such as,\n\u201cwhat do you want to accomplish?\u201d, \u201cwhat are you interested in?\u201d and \u201chow do\nyou think you learn best?\u201d to uncover their aspirations and interests, and\nmatch their needs to the right certification or training programme.\n\nThese conversations are a good time to lay out any expectations to ensure\neveryone is on the same page. This will also help the employee understand what\nthey should look out for during the programme.\n\n> ##### Apart from looking at the type of course and the institution, don\u2019t\n> forget to thoroughly examine the course outline, look for reviews, as well\n> as ask about the approach that will be taken.\n\n### Do your homework\n\nAfter identifying the employee\u2019s needs and the type of certification or\ntraining programme, it\u2019s important for you to do your homework. Apart from\nlooking at the type of course and the institution, don\u2019t forget to thoroughly\nexamine the course outline, look for reviews, as well as ask about the\napproach that will be taken \u2013 theoretical or practical.\n\nWhy is this important? Let\u2019s say you have two courses covering the same\nsubject \u2013 course A and B. The only difference being, A takes a theoretical\napproach, while B takes a practical approach. Through the conversations above,\nhaving identified your employee learns best with a practical approach, you\nwill know course B is the way to go and vice versa.\n\n### Don\u2019t fall into the brand-name trap\n\nThrough it all, remember not to fall into the brand-name trap. It is not\nnecessary to send staff to a course just because it\u2019s from big names such as\nHarvard \u2013 what\u2019s more important is whether the courseware meets your business\nneeds. That is likely the optimum way to ensure a substantial ROI on your\nlearning intervention.\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

And we realize that perhaps it's time to change; for which\nwe did a series of focus group discussions and surveys across the office\nlocations who came up with flexibility as the biggest things as a value add to\ntheir benefits. This transpired the entire context of how \u2018My benefits\u2019 came\nin.\u201d\n\n**Employee Engagement**\n\nPhilips tied up with the right partners and gave its employees the flexibility\nto choose the benefits for themselves, however, kept a certain amount fixed in\nmedical insurance for people might miss that out in enthusiasm.\n\nThere are a fixed amount of points that everyone gets, but the spending habit\nis entirely upon the employee. The organization has seen much enthusiasm about\nactually taking these benefits because the organisation brings them at a much\nbetter rate and has now given a provision of investing part of the salary\nalso, because of being cost-effective through Philips \u2018My Benefits\u2019.\n\n **Technology in HR**\n\nTechnology has been helpful to the HR, especially in making data-based\ndecisions, however, Armaan believes the human connection between HR and the\nemployee base is still very much there and he doesn't see that changing at\nleast for the next ten years as well.\n\nHe added, \u201cYou could have any number of chatbots, but it will still not have\nthat human touch which happens during a face-to-face interaction with a person\nand we notice here in Phillips that employees prefer human interaction.\u201d\n\nTechnology has helped in coming up with flexible initiatives like \u2018My\nBenefits\u2019, but Philips is very much focused on partnering and ensuring the\nemployee connect is very strong which reflects in its engagement scores as\nwell.\n\n **Benefits**\n\nPhilips is planning to add learning benefits next year, which will allow\nemployees to use their points in learning a new skill. Armaan Seth opines the\norganisation has already been quite progressive, but of course, can always\nkeep getting better.\n\n **Work Culture**\n\nOrganisations need to keep pace with the changing expectations of employees\nand constantly innovate. Everything starts with having the right concept and\nPhilips came with the new paternity leave policy last year, but the\ndifferentiator here is the employees need not take it within the first six\nmonths.\n\nThe organization allows employees the flexibility to take it after their\nspouse joins back because that is when the mothers actually need their spouses\nmost during the transitioning back into the workplace and the husband can chip\nin right and Philips allows that kind of flexibility as well.\n\nArmaan says we literally talk to employees and keep getting those ideas\nquarter after quarter from employees who also keep rating us. This is one way\nwe are actually making ourselves accountable to ensure that we are keeping up\nwith the changing expectations of our employees.\n\n **Speed and flexibility**\n\nHe adds, \u201cThe HR function is very flexible and we actually asking them for a\nscore every quarter. So if you think we are just taking feedback for the heck\nof it, you can always give a lower score next quarter and enquire about the\nimplementation of idea. We also keep ourselves very accountable of how HR is\ndoing, whether HR is flexible enough and coming up with inspiring benefits to\nkeep up with the time.\u201d\n\nArmaan however adds that implementing an initiative which has a huge cost\nimplication will take much more time, which entirely depends on approvals but\nPhilips tries to be as quick as possible to make that change wherever there is\na much wider impact of a benefit in terms of other departments coming in which\nobviously takes more time.\n\n **Hiring and Skillset**\n\nThe skill sets Philips focuses are around digital, which essentially has to do\nwith the digital space. The second is solutions; so having that end-to-end\nview of conceptualizations to sell solutions is a difficult skill as well.\n\nAnd the third one Philips actually looks for very closely is a continuous\nimprovement which helps the businesses get more operational efficiency and has\nnot gone out of fashion.\n\nArmaan said, \u201cLooking at the software side of things we are talking about\nmachine learning, AI and data analytics. While hiring a candidate, we would\nfocus first on the cultural fit for Phillips followed by the harder skills.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cHiring and retaining is a continuous journey because we are not\ntrying to hit a number for the heck of it. We are trying to get women in the\nright rules and continue creating a platform to hire women and retain them by\ngiving the right opportunities to grow. We are trying to get more women\nparticipation in succession planning talent management, which is mandatory for\nevery role in Phillips at the middle and senior management.\u201d\n\nOther activities like learning leadership program training follow suit and\nensure people are actually getting ready. So it's a journey and Philips is\ntrying to change almost 200 years of culture in two years right where women\nhave not been.\n\nArmaan vocalizes about some functions like sales, operations, and customer\nservice have a smaller talent pool in the market and it's important to both\nbuild and buy talent.\n\n **Work flexibility**\n\nWhat Philips does is being quite flexible with the working arrangements even\nafter the six months of maternity break, allowing work from home where\nemployees are allowed five days a month work from home. At the same time the\nmanagement still misses out on a large pool of talent outside Phillips, who\nwould want to return taking a longer break, and have a program called \u2018Back in\nthe game\u2019, where Philips actually reaches out to women who have had to take a\ncareer break because of maternity or other family matters and want to\ntransition back into the workforce.\n\nWomen actually decide whether working in Phillips is something that they would\ncontinue doing again. It all goes back to the culture that we have created.\n\nThe last thing we want employees to worry about is if the company has my back\nor not, which allows employees to give their best. We are focusing on\ninclusion and diversity to really bring about a change in the way we work and\nmake it sustainable.\n\n **Corporate Wellness**\n\nArmaan believes an ideal corporate wellness program has to be holistic, and\nnot just physical because he sees a lot of organizations get caught in just\ngiving a gym membership and saying it's done and is very holistic. He feels\nthe whole mental part of it is as important as physical because of the fast-\npaced lives, having very little mental space for different things.\n\nSo it needs to be a mix of emotional physical and financial aspects, hitting\nmilestones in each of these three areas. And again it comes down to\nflexibility again, without the assumption of \u2018one size fits all\u2019.\n\n\u201cThere are only a handful of companies who are fully flexible and we have to\nbe one of them and we are very proud of it as well.\n\n**Strategic HR**\n\nArmaan believes the HR has changed not into a more strategic role but in the\nbusiness decisions for people. The business leaders have also evolved over\ntime to understand the importance of HR and what HR can contribute and how\nthey can contribute.\n\nHR doesn\u2019t need to be confined to just operational things like payroll and\nsurveys but has moved to the very next level creating positive employee\nexperience across the life cycle of an employee and coming up with ideas to\nalign with the vision in terms of capabilities in terms of skill-building. HR\nis one of the most strategic functions in any organization now and there are\npeople who are actually contributing and making it happen across sectors.\n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n[philips](/tags/philips-6075/) [philips india](/tags/philips-india-16872/)\n[work culture](/tags/work-culture-16475/) [hiring](/tags/hiring-1749/)\n[Flexibility](/tags/Flexibility-79880/) [jobs](/tags/jobs-1747/) [skill\nset](/tags/skill-set-23031/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

Waddill, Ed. D._\n\n **Part 1 : Mobile Learning**\n\nPart 2:[ Information Systems](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/technology/Pages/Kick-start-Your-Digital-HR-Strategy-Information-\nSystems.aspx)  \n\nPart 3: [Social Networking](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/technology/Pages/Kick-Start-Your-Digital-HR-Strategy-Social-\nNetworking.aspx)  \n\nHR has a new role in the twenty-first century. The good news is that\norganizations finally realize that the human resources management function is\nvital to their overall success and profitability. Since employees are every\norganization's biggest asset and since HR interfaces with employees from pre-\nhire to separation, HR is involved from beginning to end with an employee's\nexperience within an organization. That is a lot of responsibility. As a\nresult, the roles of twenty-first-century HR professionals have changed to\ninclude new competencies including business acumen, ethical practices,\nleadership and navigation (with political finesse), HR expertise, relationship\nmanagement, consultation, global and cultural effectiveness, communication,\nand critical evaluation. Communication and critical evaluation pertain\ndirectly to technology skills, and both of these skills can be supported and\nenhanced by mobile technology.  \n\nMobile computing impacts the field of learning. Executives, small business\nowners, and those with HR responsibilities find themselves needing to use new\nmethods to consistently incorporate formal learning, informal learning, and\nleadership development methods in the workplace. (Mobile learning, or\nm-learning, may be the answer to address all three.) In order to be effective,\nHR leaders must be aware of and use theories of learning and instruction that\nfit mobile technology.  \n\nWe know that those without access to high-speed connections are increasingly\nat a disadvantage. This disparity has been labeled \"the digital divide,\"\nreferring to the gap in opportunities between those who have access to high-\nspeed, high-quality connections and those who do not. This opportunity gap can\nbe said to stem from the fact that most recent technologies are focused on\nnetwork-enabled tools that are often reliant on broadband Internet. However,\nin many ways, mobile technology bridges the gap by making learning platforms\naccessible from mobile devices like cell phones. Now the leading-edge goal in\nbusiness is to be mobile friendly. Top-quality learning and development\nproducts can be delivered to mobile devices, thereby reaching a broader\naudience than the desktop-based online audience and overcoming the divide.  \n\nM-learning refers to the use of a mobile device (smartphone, cell phone, or\ntablet) for learning purposes and provides learning beyond the boundaries of\ndeveloped nations to many developing nations and people around the globe. This\nis no small achievement and it is one that you need to know about, especially\nwith regard to the impact on employee learning and development. We address\nm-learning design guidelines, explaining what they are and how they differ\nfrom standard principles of instructional design. Additionally, we explain how\naugmented and virtual reality can be used effectively as mobile learning.  \n\nIn 2016, an estimated 62.9 percent of the global population already owned a\nmobile phone, and it is forecasted to continue to grow, rounding to 67 percent\nby 2019. Given the exponential increase in the number of mobile phones and the\nincreased hours of usage, forward-thinking HR professionals must realize the\nadvantages of using mobile devices for work purposes, specifically for\ntraining or training support. If most people in the workplace are using mobile\ndevices, why not incorporate mobility into learning activities? Or, better\nyet, why not deliver training to the mobile device?  \n\nFor the last decade, instructional designers have been developing an approach\nto deliver training on mobile devices. One of these design approaches,\nUniversal Instructional Design or UID, is impacting the design of all online\ninstruction, not just m-learning. UID has many associated principles. UID\nprinciples provide an effective approach to the design of learning based on\nthe technology, audience, context, content, and pedagogy. These design\nconsiderations can be further specified as follows:\n\n  *  **Technology category.** This requires a review of the technology for compatibility of the devices the intended audience uses, the access method, organizational policies to support the technology, and metrics for measuring the impact and results of the technology. \n  * **Audience.** Requires knowing and being able to describe the intended audience, what their learning needs are, what interests them, and the technologies that they use for their workplace priorities. \n  * **Context.** Requires examination and identification of the environmental conditions for learning, formal or informal learning opportunities, possible distractions, corporate norms for technology usage, and cultural norms regarding the technology.\n  *  **Content.** Addresses the match of the instructional design to the content, incorporating active, problem-based, or project-based learning that is both challenging to the learner and suited to the content.\n  *  **Pedagogy.** Requires determination of the role of the instructor and student and what must be accomplished. Otherwise known as the instructional goal. Ideally this approach assumes the instructor's role as guide-by-the-side rather than sage-on-the-stage, giving the learners more control by allowing them to analyze, synthesize, and construct their own, new learnings. \n\nUID impacts the structure of the course and the curriculum. M-Learners need to\nknow how each learning courselet fits into a whole course or curriculum. You\ncan help them identify this by making the structure of the course clear with a\ncontent plan of the whole course at the beginning of each courselet.\nSimilarly, it is important to make the objectives for each courselet clear at\nthe start so that learners have an overall indication of what will be covered.\nContent that is applicable to mobile learning includes short, two- to three-\nminute videos, a few frames of content, and simple interactions such as polls\nor short quizzes.  \n\nHR professionals can use their power and influence to help others see the\npossibilities and think outside the box, especially in regard to mobile\nlearning. The first step is to examine the technology options\u2014including\nsmartphones, cell phones, tablets, and hand-held computers\u2014that provide\nalternatives to PC-based access to learning.  \n\nM-learning delivered to mobile devices allows students to learn from a variety\nof locations where online, PC-based courseware may not be accessible. Often,\nareas that have no broadband Internet will still have telecommunications\ncapabilities. The availability of learning courses and courselets on mobile\ndevices in situations where there is no broadband Internet extends learning.\nPeople can obtain information and learning materials on mobile devices almost\nanywhere and at any time.  \n\n____Deborah D.

The Human Resources department in an organization is in\ncharge of finding the right talent and conducting training programs for\nemployees and are strategically positioned to push the learning curve for\nemployees.\n\nA study conducted by PwC showed that 62 per cent of businesses believe that HR\nplays an important role in the organization. Here a few ways the HR department\ncan improve the workplace culture:\n\n  \n\n  1. Mentorship programs\n\nMentorship and guidance and powerful tool that can really foster a sense of\nbelonging among employees and increase their confidence. It can give employees\nbetter direction in their career path and strengthen their learning curve.\n\n  \n\n2\\. Increasing employee satisfaction\n\nThe HR department should strive to provide job satisfaction for their\nemployees in order to increase motivation. This can be done with flexible work\noptions and staff get-togethers.\n\n  \n\n3\\. Increase commitment to goals\n\nThe HR department can encourage workers to perform well at their jobs and\ncommit to their goals. This ensures that there is a proper flow of\ncommunication and information which can increase employee commitment and\nenable a smooth learning curve.\n\n  \n\n4\\. More development opportunities\n\nWhen employees are overwhelmed with their jobs, it leave little time to focus\non person development. The HR department can provide workers with resources to\nmaintain healthy relationships and develop their personal skills.\n\n  \n\n5\\. Flexible work opportunities\n\nEmployees will be more motivated to work and learn if they have liberty over\nhow and when they work. HR can provide flexible work opportunities and diverse\nways to learn and improve on the job through seminars and team building\nactivities.\n\n  \n\n6\\. Training programs\n\nOne of the best ways to facilitate the learning curve is through training\nprograms that will teach employees new skills and increase their productivity.\nThis will improve their learning curve as they become better at their job.\n\n  \n\n7\\. HR should be a business partner\n\nInstead of overseeing employees, HR should become a strategic partner to\nbetter align the needs of the organization and achieve the collective goals of\nthe company. This will encourage companies to constantly improve on their\nexisting business practices.\n\n  \n\nThe role of HR has become more versatile in recent years as they have taken on\nthe role of not just hiring and training employees but also facilitating\nconstant learning and improvement.\n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

Yet, we are\nlearner experts because we can comment from a user\u2019s perspective regarding the\nlearning experience itself. So, I spent several hours browsing the platform\nand taking numerous courses.\n\nMy reaction was complicated and multi-faceted, and my response to the client\u2019s\nrequest was not so simply apparent. I realized everyone\u2019s definition of good\ninstructional quality varies according to:  \n\n  * exactly what the expected outcomes are\n  * what the targeted audience expects\n  * what guarantees are offered\n  * how critical the content is to the performance of the roles held by the audience. \n\nAs it turns out, job performance is especially critical to my client\u2019s user\naudience because the content spans numerous topics around public safety\u2014from\nlaw enforcement, to fire protection, to custodial and corrections services.\nAnd, in some cases, performance criteria for these roles has been legislated\nby local, state, and federal governments.\n\nThis reminded me of the much bigger question related to the subject of this\nblog series for the last five years: What business are you in? In this case,\nthe I asked them if this was a technology or a content company?\n\nWhile certainly technology is needed to deliver content, and content fuels the\ntechnology, many organizations in our industry haven\u2019t quite figured out the\nanswer to that question. They end up ineffectively splitting their resources\nbetween the two, sub-optimizing the organizations\u2019 performances. If your\nbusiness is focused on the continuous curation of your content expertise that\njust so happens to be delivered on an LMS platform, that\u2019s where your focus\nshould be. If, on the other hand, you are more interested in providing the\nmost engaging learning experiences via technological delivery, you need to\nfocus on continually updating and adding appropriate features to your platform\nto enhance those learning experiences.\n\nEssentially, only when you know what business you are in will questions about\nplatform and course quality become apparent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps, the first questions you should ask are these:  \n\n  * What are you trying to achieve? \n  * What are the learners\u2019 characteristics? \n  * What are the expectations of the buying organization? \n  * How will you deliver your solutions? \n  * Is your pricing aligned with the learners\u2019 and their organizations\u2019 capacities?\n\nOnce I understood the answers to those questions, it became clearer to me that\nwhile I felt the courseware and platform could have been significantly\nimproved, it was good enough for what it was trying to accomplish. Most\nimportantly, I realized that its learning outcomes were focused more on\n_education_ than on _training_. By this, I mean that more information and\nknowledge acquisition than pure behavior change was required. Or, as some\npundits have characterized it, the \u201cknowing versus doing\u201d dichotomy, wherein\nknowing is about _acquisition_ of knowledge and doing is about the\n_application_ of knowledge. The degree of instructional soundness required for\nboth ends of this continuum are quite different. Issues around responsive\ndesign and the use of tile panels, badges, gamification, microlearning,\nlearner control, and the like are more important the closer you get to the\nbehavior change end of the desired outcome continuum.\n\nAs it turns out, this particular firm largely provides information about the\ndos and don\u2019ts of interacting appropriately in a variety of public service\nsituations, some of which are compliance-mandated and others of which are\nbased on loose legal policy, general guidance, and even common sense. In many\ncases, there isn\u2019t much need for high-end interactivity with learning bells\nand whistles. Video demos of right versus wrong ways with follow-up discussion\nby experts and then some knowledge testing might be enough; however, when\nbehavior change is required to become compliant\u2014that is, more on the \u201cdoing\u201d\nside\u2014 deeper immersive learning experiences with high interactivity, and even\nsimulations, would be most appropriate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeware, however, of the curse of overengineering your product or program\nsolution, which can be detrimental to the growth of your business. You must\ndetermine whether your learner audience needs knowledge acquisition or\nbehavior change, or perhaps a little of both, in which case your instructional\ndesign should be appropriately reflected.\n\nAs you build your business, have you thoroughly considered what business you\nare in? Do you have a good understanding of your target customers? Do you\nfully understand what your customers and their audiences really need in a\nlearning solution? And, does your instructional format accurately optimize\nthese learning outcomes?\n\n**For more insight, check out my book[ _The Complete Guide to Building and\nGrowing a Talent Development Firm_](https://www.td.org/books/the-complete-\nguide-to-building-and-growing-a-talent-development-firm)**.  \n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [Change Management](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Change%20Management)\n  * [Consulting Competencies](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Consulting%20Competencies)\n  * [Managing the Learning Function](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Managing%20the%20Learning%20Function)\n  * [Organizational Development](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Organizational%20Development)\n  * [Performance Consulting](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Performance%20Consulting)\n  * [Project Management](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Project%20Management)\n  * [Strategic Planning](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Strategic%20Planning)\n\n[ ](https://www.td.org/user/about/SteveCohen)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[Steve Cohen](https://www.td.org/user/about/SteveCohen)\n\nCohen is founder and principal of the Strategic Leadership Collaborative, a\nprivate consulting practice focused on business strategy and development.

It presents a comparison of\nfindings from 2003, 2009, and 2017._\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that it has been roughly 14 years since Dr. Karl Kapp\nfirst tried to address the question: How long does it take to develop one hour\nof employee training?\n\nIn 2009, as innovations in authoring tools and simulated learning started to\npermeate the market, it became clear that L&D professionals needed new answers\nto this fundamental question. Karl and I gladly took to that request and\nexpanded the understanding of developmental hours and common challenges\npractitioners face when producing training. ([See the 2009\narticle](https://www.td.org/newsletters/learning-circuits/time-to-develop-one-\nhour-of-training-2009).)\n\nClearly, this is a compelling line of inquiry that remains a constant in our\nindustry. What\u2019s more, maybe it\u2019s our field\u2019s propensity to create order from\nchaos that we continue to pose the question. No matter the reason, I was\nexcited to reprise this research with the help of ATD to present the most\ncurrent findings based on levels of engagement.\n\nIn this article, we will explore the results from a 2017 survey, compare that\ndata to the previous two studies, and discuss a few trends that have emerged\nover the years. If you are unfamiliar with the research, the data helps to\nsquelch the desire to say, \u201cIt depends\u2026\u201d when a client asks how long it will\ntake to develop employee training. These numbers provide another way for\nproject planners to budget time, money, and resources, and they can be used in\nplace of or in conjunction with estimates based on old projects with similar\nneeds. At a minimum, it provides a method for making estimates, comparisons,\nor both.  \n\n## **The 2017 Study**\n\nTo conduct the current study, the questions from the last two studies were\nexamined, as well as trends in how industry professionals are discussing the\ndevelopment of employee training. For instance, learner engagement or level of\ndesigned interaction appears to be framing the current discourse.\nConsequently, the 2017 survey only covers levels of interaction, whereas the\nprevious survey asked about development tools and levels of interaction based\non the ADDIE model. The new survey also did not reprise the line of inquiry on\ntemplate use within development.\n\nRespondents to the 2017 study were presented two questions. The first question\nidentified what types of training respondents were involved with, from a\ndesign and development aspect. The second question asked respondent to share\nhow long it typically takes them or their teams to design and develop one hour\nof instruction. The term[ _e-learning_](https://www.td.org/talent-development-\nglossary-terms/what-is-e-learning) was defined as asynchronous and self-paced\nfor purposes of this study.\n\nWith the survey updated, ATD reached out to L&D practitioners to gather data\nover a few weeks during the summer of 2017. Three-quarters of respondents (76\npercent) indicated they are involved in designing and developing traditional\nlive in-person classroom training. Almost half of respondents (49 percent)\nstated they are involved with live instructor-led synchronous training\ndelivered virtually.\n\nSome additional data includes:  \n\nAdvertisement\n\n  * 49 percent design and develop Level 1 E-Learning. This is passive e-learning where the learner acts simply as a receiver of information.\n  * 49 percent are involved with Level 2 E-learning. This is defined as limited interactivity, with the learner offering simple responses to instructional cues.\n  * 29 percent say that they or their team design and develop Level 3 E-Learning. This level has complex interactions that requests the learner to make multiple and varied responses to cues.\n  * 12 percent of respondents or their teams are involved with Level 4 E-learning. These real-time interactions create life-like sets of complex cues and responses. \n\nTable 1 details the 2017 findings.\n\nIn 2009, we acknowledged an increase in training and development hours\ncompared to 2003 data. For the 2009 study, we expanded the set of questions in\nan attempt to create a profile of respondents. In addition, the development\ntime was discussed in conjunction to the ADDIE model, but also to the type of\ndevelopment tool being used. Finally, the study also considered whether\ntraining was being developed with the aid of a template.\n\nTable 2 summarizes the averages from the 2017 study in comparison to 2009\naverages (Levels 1-3 only).\n\nTable 3 compares 2017 and 2003 data. Again, the averages used from 2003 were\nbased on development estimates that used a template (Levels 1 \u2013 3 only).\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that many responses to the 2017 study still cite the\nprevalence of traditional, face-to-face learning. Additionally, a majority of\nrespondents reported a preference for live, virtual training. This tells me\nthat even though we are reducing the overall time to develop training,\nrespondents are still catering to clients who seek training solutions that\noffer potentially \u201climited interactions\u201d that are seen in Level 2 E-Learning.\nMy reason for stating \u201cpotentially\u201d is that both the traditional, face-to-face\ntraining and live, virtual training may have elements that are considered\ncomplex or real-time; for example, a team-based exercise resolving conflict or\nsimulating an emergency, and so forth. No doubt, this requires further study.  \n\n## **Unknown Factors Impact Development Time**\n\nSo why did hours over the years go up and then down as we look at data from\n2003 through 2017?\n\nA likely influencing factor is that we broke up the survey differently in 2009\nand asked for more information from respondents. For example, in 2009, we\ndiscovered that subject matter experts and project scope appeared to have the\nlargest effect on the estimates provided by respondents. In 2017, the purpose\nof the study was to update such estimates.\n\nHowever, to better approximate development times in the future, it would be\nimportant to gain insight into how individual respondents determined their\ntime estimates. For example, it would be useful to know how many years of\nexperience respondents have and whether they have specialized skills (UX\ndesign) or are more general practitioners (project manager, instructional\ndesigner, and developer). Further, what type of domains (cognitive or\naffective, for instance) have they developed learning products for in their\norganizations?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also would be helpful to know the environment of the developers. Do they\nwork for a vendor or are they part of an internal team that develops learning\nproducts in-house? In addition, do they specialize in certain types of\ninteraction? For example, a respondent who works for a vendor that focuses on\nthe development of Level 3 and 4 training products may report lower\ndevelopment times because the company has more than likely created efficient\nprocesses for design and development.\n\nOf course, we cannot forget about the importance of the actual technology.\nWhat type of authoring tool is being used to develop? Is it up-to-date or\nantiquated? Does the training solution involve some sort of technology that\nrequires implementation and partnership with IT?\n\nFinally, it may be important to know who the client is. What is the client\u2019s\ninfluence and input? Do they understand their role in the development process?\nIf not, their involvement can lead to project scope creep and an increase in\ndevelopment hours.  \n\n## **Bottom Line**\n\nI conclude, as will many L&D professionals, that \u201cone hour of employee\ntraining\u201d is not the sole answer to our needs. But it can provide a useful\ntool for guiding how we manage learning development. Although the 2017 data\ndenote a trend for e-learning with limited interactions, such options may not\nbe optimal as the demand for training on soft skill topics increases\u2014probably\nin response to the growing cross-generational workforce. In fact, such topics\nas team collaboration, business communication, and active listening are\nbecoming principal needs for organizations. These are ideal opportunities for\nnot only in-person or virtual training, but also Level 4 e-learning\ninteractions.\n\nIn truth, the data we do have is helpful as a gauge for estimating training\nand development times. But until further research is done to correlate the\nrespondent\u2019s professional profile, a general summary of the development\nprocess, and the type of learning content being developed, we are a going to\ncontinue to have this discussion about how long it takes to develop\ne-learning! (Although, I think many of us actually enjoy the discourse!

In an internal survey, when women\nemployees at JSW were asked about the most important aspects of their work,\nthey unanimously ranked \u201cCareer and learning opportunities\u201d as pivotal for\ntheir Career Growth. This feedback was the starting point to design\n_#Girlswannalearn_ , Digital Learning program for Women @ JSW.\n\nLow representation of women in Mid-Top management levels was the data point\nwhich created a strong business case for a program of this scale. The program\nwas introduced by merging learning and development to culture change. The\nwomen\u2019s development program using technology was designed to build managerial\ncapabilities and nurture leadership skills to equip women navigate through\ncorporate maze and advance their career.\n\n\u201cOne of our endeavors in JSW is to build multifaceted capability and\ncompetency for our employees through blended learning methods. And e-learning\nhas been one of our success mantra to bring the blended learning method alive\nfor our employees. #Girlswannalearn is a live example of this method and\nembodies our Group\u2019s philosophy to be #BetterEveryday.\u201d Ajanta Chatterjee-\nGroup Head Talent and OD.\n\n**#Girlswannalearn**\n\nUsing the internal survey and insights from the Development Center, a list of\ncompetencies and skills were identified for the women to advance their career\nat JSW. A 21-day learning pathway was designed to master 8 habits of Highly\nSuccessful Women.\n\n  * Habit-1 Learning Agility\n  * Habit-2 Adaptability\n  * Habit-3 Resilience\n  * Habit-4 Organizing Performance\n  * Habit-5 Diversity of Thought\n  * Habit-6 Choosing the Best Solution\n  * Habit-7 Leading Teams\n  * Habit-8 Relationship Management\n\nEach habit\u2019s courseware modules were designed using Skillsoft client\ncommunity, leadership videos bundled up to provide mastery and enhance the\nproficiency of the skill.\n\n**Learner Engagement**\n\nRecognition systems helped entice participation. As learners completed each\nlearning habit, \u201cActive learner\u201d badges were handed out. The first 10\nemployees to complete all courses were recognized. A list of top 10 employees\nwho displayed an effort to learn and develop were recognized through mailers,\nannouncements on the intranet & wall of fame.\n\nReal-time updates on location participation and close runner ups were also\nshared after each habit concluded to generate buzz and delight learners.\n\nCourses aligned to JSW\u2019s potential indicator framework were bundled and mapped\nto facilitate all-round development. The participants were awarded with\ncertificates on completion of the courses.\n\nThe four core phases of a high-performance learning journey\n\n  * Commit to the journey\n  * Building the knowledge foundation\n  * Develop and practice Skills\n  * Strengthen results\n\nThe entire journey required participants to continuously practice what they\nlearned. And through post-intervention survey, the L&D team was able to\nsupport the learning process using constructive feedback from peers,\nsupervisors, and customers, the behavior and skills were further strengthened.\n\nDeveloping a sense of involvement among teams and an inspiring ecosystem\nhelped succeed. It motivated women employees to actively learn and transfer\nthe learnings on the job. This realization is seen as the biggest factor in\nthe learning process, it's intrinsic and impactful. The \u2018Sense of Involvement\u2019\nin creating learning pathways plays a prime role in engaging learners\nthroughout the development journey.\n\n**Impact of #Girlswannalearn initiative**\n\n  * 92% Unique users accessed e-learning resources\n  * 100% Modules were accessed\n  * 95% of participants said it was easy to access the courses.\n  * Top modules that were accessed or completed by women were Preparing for your performance appraisal, planning an effective performance appraisal, Unleashing personal and team creativity, Innovation, Strategic thinking.\n  * In a survey conducted by JSW Learning Academy, 95% of the respondents said they liked the initiative #Girlswannalearn and 98% respondents said they have recommended e-learning courses to a fellow colleague, 87% of the respondents could effectively transfer learning on the job.\n\n**Benefits of e-Learning in supporting Women\u2019s growth and development**\n\n_Wider outreach:_\n\nLearning was made available without any budget constraint. Women at any\nlocation and in any grade had access to high quality and relevant learning\nmodules.\n\n_Solution for training penalty:_\n\nLong-ingrained gender stereotypes. Work cultures that value face time over\nresults. A leaky pipeline that does little to retain women in the jobs\nnecessary to get the top roles. Women are not preferred for Job Specific,\nCareer Development training programs. #Girlswannalearn was specifically\ncurated for women by aligning learning goals of women and also by benchmarking\ncutting edge topics relevant to help women advance their career. Specialized\nknowledge & skill building programs were aligned to their career trajectory.\n\n_Work-life balance_\n\nWomen want to keep their skills up to date, but when a course involves long\nduration, it can be difficult to juggle career and family commitments. Using\ndigital and blended learning opportunities, it is now possible for women to\ntackle this challenge and support their career aspirations.\n\n_Enhanced engagement of women employees: -_\n\nAs people take on greater responsibility and have more direct interaction with\nthe C-suite, they tend to become more engaged. To address the concerns and\nenhance employee engagement of women, the company is providing role-specific\nbehavioral, leadership skills & technical skills training to women employees.\nThe idea is to empower and equip them with right skills to take up larger\nresponsibilities & move cross-functionally. This has led to increased\nengagement of women employees at JSW.\n\n**A Journey, not a Milestone**\n\nOffering high quality and meaningful content will keep learners fully engaged\nand motivated to learn. On the other hand, including information that is\ngeneral and not specific won't bring any added value to the eLearning course,\nand may even make the learner question the value of the eLearning course as a\nwhole. So, stay on-topic and always ensure that you offer information that\nwill help them to improve their knowledge base and learn or improve upon the\ndesired skill set. The key to finding what's relevant for online courses is to\nalign it with what the learner may find valuable. If one is able to find a\nmiddle ground, you will be able to develop an eLearning strategy that provides\nthe most benefit for everyone involved.\n\nIt's essential that learners are given the opportunity to explore the\neLearning course if we want it to be fully interactive. We are including links\nin our communication that learners can just click in order to learn more about\nthe topic. This is a key element that has enabled us to create interactive\neLearning courses that enhance learners\u2019 engagement and keep them coming back\nfor more knowledge and information.

brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\n### **Wani Azahar** _ **involved experts from Infineon Technologies, Cotton On\nGroup, and Singapore Airlines to unearth the 3Cs behind a great corporate\nwellness programme - contextualisation, control and comprehensiveness.**_\n\nWhen _Human Resources_ spoke to **Butch Clas, HR director for SEA and ANZ\nat**[ **Dow Chemical** ,](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-dow-\nchemical-helped-staff-reduce-stress-7/ \"Case study: How Dow Chemical helped\nstaff reduce stress by 7%\") we found out how healthcare and wellness\ninitiatives help to improve employee satisfaction in various dimensions.\n\n\u201cWe believe that a healthy body and mind will lead to improved productivity,\nand hence, it is important to us to focus on initiatives that will make\nemployees happy at work,\u201d he said.\n\nIn fact, Dow Chemical\u2019s yearly internal employee attitude survey has shown an\nimprovement in the stress reduction by 7% \u2013 supporting why having a corporate\nwellness programme is important. Not only does it benefit the employees, it\nalso significantly benefits the business.\n\nHowever, one of the biggest problems HR faces on employee wellness programmes\nis the lack of participation. In fact, 52% of employers surveyed by Limeade\nadmitted it was the biggest challenge, with 49% citing difficulty in\nmaintaining interest and activation with 36% of respondents feeling like it\u2019s\na battle to help employees develop long-term healthy habits.\n\nWith that, _Human Resources_ took it to the experts and spoke to Cotton On\nGroup, Infineon Technologies and Singapore Airlines to find out the 3C\u2019s\nbehind a great corporate wellness programme \u2013 contextualisation, control and\ncomprehensiveness.\n\n# #1 Contextualised to the markets\n\nAs Millennials take over the workforce, it provides HR a different set of\nexpectations to meet when it comes to wellness. This change in the talent\nlandscape makes it all the more crucial for HR policies, strategies and\npractices to evolve and address the current and upcoming needs, as well as,\nmain interests of the workforce.\n\nFor example, a look at how 41.29% of Millennials admitted to spending more on\ncoffee than they invested in their retirement might be an indication of what\ntruly matters to a younger workforce.\n\nSimilarly, HR should also look into what actually appeals to different markets\ndue to a diverse workforce.\n\nAccording to [American\nExpress](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/content/GiftCards-\nMySiteProject/page-level-components/corporate-programs/corporate-programs-\nhub/The_Business_Benefits_of_Wellness_Programs.pdf), it is critical for\nsuccess that \u201ceach company has its own customised wellness philosophy and\ndesign, because there is no one design that will work for everyone. Successful\nwellness programmes are aligned with individual company cultures and employee\nneeds.\u201d\n\n### **Case Study 1: Cotton On listens to what each market really needs**\n\nAustralian retail chain [Cotton On\nGroup](http://www.cottonongroupcareers.com/dashboard) is an Australian-born\nfashion retailer with a suite of seven brands; Cotton On, Cotton On Kids,\nCotton On Body, Factorie, Rubi, Typo and Supr\u00e9. These brands cover categories\nincluding men\u2019s and women\u2019s apparel, childrenswear, footwear, stationery,\ngiftware, sleepwear, activewear, teen and youth fashion in addition to its\nphilanthropic arm, the Cotton On Foundation.\n\nWith over 1,500 stores, the company is present in 19 countries and a global\nteam of more than 22,000, including Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.\n\n![The Cotton On Group team gets ready together for Run World, a fun run\ninitiative to raise money for children\u2019s\nhealthcare](http://images.humanresourcesonline.net.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2017/04/Three-Employees-4-e1492401639724.jpg)\n\nThe Cotton On Group team gets ready together for Run World, a fun run\ninitiative to raise money for children\u2019s healthcare\n\nLaunched in Australia in 2009, Cotton On Group\u2019s health and wellness programme\nrolled out to global markets the following year \u2013 and landed on Singapore\nshores in 2013.\n\nThe programme is led by **Luke McLean, the health and wellbeing manager** who\nis based in its global head office in Geelong, Australia. The health and\nwellbeing department sits within its people and performance function, and is\nfocused on ensuring its team is happy, engaged, motivated and healthy.\n\nAlthough the programme hailed from Australia, the firm\u2019s health and wellbeing\nambassadors in each region work with McLean to roll out a regionally and\nfunctionally specific programme to tailor to the local markets.\n\nFor example, its operations in Asia span four different countries, all with\ndiverse needs. For this reason, it has arranged celebrations for different\ncultural events such as Deepavali or Hari Raya (and given it is Aussie born\nand bred, Australia Day!), as well as tailored offerings such as country-\nspecific medical plans and counselling.\n\nWith a great understanding of how each team member has different interests and\nneeds, the firm finds it is paramount to deliver tailored programmes to its\nemployees.\n\n**ALSO READ:** [Top corporate wellness consultants of\n2016](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/events/top-corporate-wellness-\nconsultants-2016/ \"Top corporate wellness consultants of 2016\")\n\nSome of these are designed for individuals such as personal training sessions\nat in-house gyms or one-on-one health and well being coaching across its hubs.\n\nOther programmes are rolled out for its employees worldwide, but tailored\naccording to location, including initiatives such as digital health education\nor well being events organised in-country.\n\nRecently, the organisation rolled out minigolf tournaments and boot camps on\nthe beach \u2013 all of which received excellent participation rates.\n\nSimilarly, the country hub office in Asia is no different. Meditation and\nZumba classes, team hikes, mindfulness education, fruit drops to stores and\nthe distribution centre and the Run World fun run for charity have all been\nvery popular programmes.\n\nIn fact, the team recently held yoga sessions and provided massages for team\nmembers, as they geared up to take on Lunar New Year trade. Catering to\neverybody\u2019s wellness journey, the organisation has found that a one-version-\nfits-all approach doesn\u2019t work.\n\nWhile the programmes are all optional, the group found a vast majority of its\nstaff globally are focused on health and wellbeing \u2013 across body, mind and\nspirit \u2013 and therefore want to engage with the different initiatives it has\noffered. When the organisation first began to design the programmes, employees\nwere very much involved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a retail business, so we think of our people like our customers \u2013 we\nask them what they expect and then deliver this. We gathered this information\nthrough surveys, focus groups and general observations, and we are constantly\nre-evaluating our programmes so they remain relevant,\u201d McLean said.\n\nDepending on the programme delivered, the firm receives up to a 65%\nparticipation rate from its employees. According to the group, team-based\ngames, challenges or sessions seem to be particularly successful as they\nprovide an opportunity for people to engage with others in a positive and\nenergetic way.\n\n> ##### We\u2019re a retail business, so we think of our people like our customers\n> \u2013 we ask them what they expect and then deliver this.\n\n###### - Luke McLean, health and wellbeing manager, Cotton On Group\n\nThis further builds healthy and productive relationships both inside and\noutside of work. McLean noted how maintaining your team members\u2019 health and\nwellbeing has many benefits. It helps team members to build a connection with\ntheir peers and increases teamwork and productivity as a result.\n\nIt helps retention rates, instils a greater sense of optimism around the\ndifferent workplaces, and helps to attract world-class talent to join the\nteam.\n\n\u201cSince day one, our people have been our biggest priority \u2013 we want to make\nsure we create experiences and work environments they love. Our health and\nwell being programme is an extension of this; it\u2019s a way to support our team\nmembers and set them up to perform at their personal best every day.\n\nOur overall goal was simply to energise our teams by providing engaging,\ninspiring and accessible wellbeing tools,\u201d he said.\n\n# #2 Control provided to employees\n\nWith [Singapore\u2019s medical inflation rate reported to be at 15% last\nyear](https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/singapore-medical-inflation-\nrate-15-040039060.html), healthcare costs are on the rise and a worrying\nfactor for many. Other than the high costs of insurance and staying healthy,\nmany professionals require different types of healthcare because of lifestyle\nchoices, habits and behaviours.\n\nWhile [Medisave](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/1-54m-singaporeans-get-\ngst-vouchers-medisave-top-ups/ \"1.54m Singaporeans to get GST vouchers and\nMedisave top-ups\") can primarily be used for hospitalisation bills, screenings\nand procedures, some may require more assistance than others \u2013 and this is why\nit\u2019s important for employees to be given the control to choose the type of\nhealthcare they require.\n\n### **CASE STUDY 2: Infineon Technologies allows control over employees\u2019\nhealth**\n\nFor the semiconductor and system solutions provider [Infineon Technologies\nAsia Pacific](http://www.infineon.com/cms/en/careers/why-us/our-\nlocations/singapore/), it believes the three important goals of a great\ncorporate wellness programme is to protect, create and sustain towards\nindividual health literacy, health-oriented leadership and healthy living.\n\nUnderstanding the importance of taking ownership over your own health, the\norganisation involves its employees in surveys and focus groups, as well as\nform cross-functional teams to develop the activities and programmes and to\nintroduce its wellness programme \u2013 Healthy Active People Programme for You\n(HAPPY).\n\nLaunched in 2014, HAPPY is a holistic programme which integrates flexible\nbenefits, medical and wellness activities that benefit all employees as part\nof the organisation\u2019s overall health and care management programme.\n\nOn a company-wide level, employees can enjoy free basic health screening\nannually. On a more personal level, staff are given the option to top-up to\nreceive different tiers of more comprehensive coverage. Employees can\ncustomise various components of their HAPPY programme according to their\npersonal and family health needs.\n\nOn top of being given a wide range of activities to participate in, employees\nare also able to choose the way they want to utilise their flexible benefits.\n\nSome of its wellness activities include social events such as nature walks,\nhealth talks and competitive sports tournaments for employees seeking a\nhealthy and active lifestyle.\n\nAs for employees with specific needs, the organisation offers targeted\nintervention programmes addressing chronic illnesses, weight management and\nsmoking. With the implementation of HAPPY, the firm is seeing increasingly\nmore self-organised activities such as running groups and badminton teams\nbeing formed.\n\nThe company also shared there is keen participation in company organised\nsports tournaments at both inter-department and inter-company levels. When\nasked about what sparked the idea behind HAPPY, an **Infineon Technologies\nAsia Pacific spokesperson** explained how the firm aims to incentivise good\nhealth rather than insure for bad health. The firm wanted to employees to be\nresponsible for their own health and wellbeing.\n\nAdding on, he said that the company's leaders are acting as role models of\nhealthy living for its employees - with the introduction of a comprehensive\nhealth-oriented leadership training programme focusing on sustainable mental\nand physical fitness.\n\n**ALSO READ:** [Wellness programmes can\u2019t work without senior leaders getting\ninvolved](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/much-activity-trackers-help-\nimprove-employee-health/ \"How much do activity trackers help to improve\nemployee health?\")\n\nNoting on how HAPPY has yield positive results, the spokesperson shared how\nthe annual health report from its medical provider has shown an improvement in\norganisational health and wellbeing. With feedback being paramount to measure\nthe effectiveness of the programme, he said the organisation monitors take-up\nrates, conducts post-programme surveys, and reviews health reports and\nstatistics from its medical provider to understand the programme better.\n\nIn addition, employees will give feedback through the \u201cGreat Place to Work\u201d\nsurvey every two years; or more instantaneously via its in-house social\nplatform. Moving forward, the company plans to look into the use of technology\nand an integrated IT solution to achieve higher rates of participation.\n\nFor example, it may implement kiosks with simple UI for shop-floor employees\nto access easily, and a point-of-sale system in the canteen to collect dietary\ndata.\n\nIt will also continue to gamify its reward programmes and activities to\nincrease the fun factor \u2013 and, of course, never forgetting to seek employees\u2019\ninput for better insights when it designs activities which are in line with\nstaff\u2019s interests and needs.\n\nOther than that, events which successfully integrate work and family life are\na favourite among employees with children. One example is its \u201cLittle Ones at\nWork\u201d programme which sees both employees and their children enjoying fun\nactivities while the kids are given the opportunity to learn more about their\nparents\u2019 workplace.\n\n# #3 Comprehensive offerings are key\n\nWith only one-tenth of your workforce equating success at work with high\nperformance and productivity, this reveals a disconnect between the\nexpectations of employees and their employers.\n\nSimilarly, each employee comes with different interests, lifestyles, health\nand wellness needs \u2013 and for a corporate wellness programme to work, it needs\nto appeal to the majority of the workforce. ** ******\n\n### **CASE STUDY 3: Singapore Airlines ensures programmes appeal to all\nstaff**\n\nAs the flag carrier of Singapore, and named the best airline in Asia last\nyear, [Singapore Airlines](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/singapore-\nairlines-opens-recruitment-nationalities/ \"Singapore Airlines opens\nrecruitment up to more nationalities\") puts great emphasis on staff wellness\nand has always encouraged its staff to participate in sporting and\nrecreational activities, and wellness programmes to keep the mind and body\nfit.\n\nWith the airline sector being a dynamic industry, its employees are always\nseen as working in a fast-moving environment. Front line staff have to\ninteract with various customers and deal with issues, and with more than half\nof its staff working on the front line, Singapore Airlines is dedicated to\nensuring staff are mentally and physically fit to tackle the challenges at\nwork.\n\nThis is why Singapore Airlines believes in providing a comprehensive wellness\nprogramme that goes beyond health scans.\n\nLaunched in early 2012, the SIA wellness and health programme (WHP) aims to\npromote healthy lifestyles and employee wellbeing. Over the years, many\nactivities under the WHP have been offered to employees.\n\nRanging from relevant talks to sports activities as well as even a helpline\nservice, the programme serves to care for the total wellbeing of its\nemployees.\n\n**ALSO READ:** [[Infographic] How to boost participation in wellness\nprogrammes](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/infographic-boost-\nparticipation-wellness-programmes/ \"Infographic: How to boost participation in\nwellness programmes\")\n\nNot only that, the organisation received a $23,068.77 workplace health\npromotion grant from the Health Promotion Board to propel its WHP.\n\nFor the past two years, SIA employees have seen a range of programmes that\nwere organised to promote healthier lifestyles.\n\nThese included talks and workshops on general health, healthy eating, sports\nsuch as aerobics or picking the right running shoes and healthy cooking.\n\nSports activities undertaken by the company included the SIA Group athletics\nmeet, SIA Group road run, the training for runners activity and the SIA open\nbadminton tournament, among others.\n\nOther workplace health initiatives rolled out for employees include free\nannual basic health screenings, a counselling helpline service, colorectal\ncancer screening and the launch of SIA\u2019s wellness and health online community\nfor staff to share health and wellness tips.\n\nOther than in-house activities, SIA also encourages staff in setting up and\njoining sports and activities clubs outside their working hours.\n\nSome of the more prominent initiatives include its Air Runners\u2019 Club, Cabin\nCrew Performing Arts Circle and the Community Service Club. Staff from various\ndepartments also organise special events such as healthy eating talks. In\naddition, Singapore Airlines has also invested in the building of recreational\nfacilities for staff to enjoy sporting activities and games.\n\nIn 2006, the airline opened the SIA Group Sports and Recreational Club next to\nthe SIA Training Centre. Staff and their families are able to play sports and\ngames and indulge in recreational activities at an affordable membership fee.\nFacilities in the clubhouse include a gymnasium, badminton halls, table\ntennis, swimming pool, video game room, karaoke rooms and a members\u2019 lounge.\n\n**Nicholas Ionides, divisional vice-president of public affairs for Singapore\nAirlines** , said: \u201cOur success would not have been possible without the\nefforts of our people. We recruit dynamic individuals from diverse backgrounds\nand we are committed to providing our employees with equal opportunities to\nachieve their full potential.\u201d\n\nBeing part of the airline industry, SIA finds it extremely important for its\npilots and cabin crew to be given sufficient rest during layovers and after\nflights to achieve their full potential. According to its [_Sustainability\nReport FY2015/16_](https://www.singaporeair.com/saar5/pdf/Investor-\nRelations/Annual-Report/sustainabilityreport1516.pdf) , cabin crews are given\nin-flight rest where mandated, according to the Fatigue Risk Management System\nguidelines stipulated by the [Civil Aviation Authority of\nSingapore](http://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/index.html).\n\nNot only that, the national carrier constantly shares information on fatigue\nand the management of it with its cabin crew to ensure they have sufficient\nrest before each duty. This is done through channels such as online\ne-courseware for employee training.\n\n> ##### We recruit dynamic individuals from diverse backgrounds and we are\n> committed to providing our employees with equal opportunities to achieve\n> their full potential.\n\n###### **- Nicholas Ionides, divisional vice-president of public affairs for\nSingapore Airlines**\n\nAdopting a holistic approach to the staff\u2019s work experience, cabin crews are\nencouraged to participate in extracurricular activities (ECA).\n\nCovering a wide range of popular interests, crew members are able to choose\nfrom a comprehensive list of activities. For those looking to find balance\nbetween work and their artistic talent, they may favour creative activities\nsuch as the music society or the cabin crew performing arts circle.\n\nOn the other hand, those who enjoy spending time outdoors can join various\nactivities such as the cabin crew tennis circle or basketball club or Golf\nCircle to maintain their active lifestyles.\n\nThe ECAs boast a total membership of more than 8,000 cabin crew and ground\nstaff in the cabin crew division, and provide excellent platforms for SIA\u2019s\ncrew to achieve work-life balance.\n\n_Lead photo /[123RF](http://www.123rf.com)_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

Glossary Terms\n\nThis easy-to use quick reference guide provides essential trainer's terms,\nalong with many need-to-know expressions for learning professionals.\n\n**A**\n\n**ADDIE** is an instructional systems design model. It is composed of five\nphases:  \n\u2022 _Analysis_ is the process of gathering data to identify specific needs\u2014the\nwho, what, where, when, and why of the design process.  \n\u2022 _Design_ is the planning stage.  \n\u2022 _Development_ is the phase in which training materials and content are\nselected and developed based on learning objectives.  \n\u2022 _Implementation_ occurs when the course is delivered, whether in person or\nelectronically.  \n\u2022 _Evaluation_ is the ongoing process of developing and improving\ninstructional materials based on feedback received during and after\nimplementation.\n\n**Adult Learning Theory** is a term that encompasses the collective theories\nand fdn principles of how adults learn and acquireknowledge. Popularized by\nMalcolm Knowles,adult learning theory provides the foundation that training\nand development professionals need to meet workplace learning needs.\n\n**Affective Learning** is the acquisition of knowledge based on Benjamin\nBloom\u2019s taxonomy in which he identified three learning domains: cognitive\n(knowledge), affective (attitude), and psychomotor (skills).

It is the driver of an\nimportant shift in information technology, one that will affect everyone who\nuses computing and telecommunications technology.\n\n**Conflict Management Theory** shapes processes designed to resolve\ndisagreement between two or more individuals. Two strategies in line with the\nconflict management theory are settlement driven and relationship-focused.\nBoth assume that the individuals involved in the conflict are the people best\npositioned to resolve the situation. If an agreement cannot be reached, an\noutside party, or _mediator,_ may be called in to facilitate a resolution.\n\n**Corporate University** is a learning organization with a governance system\nthat aligns all learning with the corporate or agency mission, strategy, and\ngoals. The governance system typically includes a governing board consisting\nof the CEO and other senior executives, as well as a chief learning officer\n(CLO) who has overall  \nresponsibility for managing the organization\u2019s investment in learning.

HR Bulletin daily email newsletter:  \nAsia's only regional HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\n## The formula for great leaders\n\n_Vital stats: Goh Chor Lim joined Roche Diagnostics in May 2013 as HR head of\nAsia Pacific. Before this, she led HR in Asia Pacific and in emerging markets\n(BRIC) with multinational corporations such as Prudential, Philips\nElectronics, and Enron. As part of her career and personal growth, she has\nlived and worked in Japan, the US, and most recently, in Hong Kong._\n\n**Q Having worked across non-pharma firms such as Prudential and Philips\nElectronics, what made you join Roche in 2013?**\n\nOne reason I joined Roche was through a referral. At that time, my predecessor\nwas moving into her new role in the business \u2013 which she is currently in \u2013 and\nI was referred by an HR person in the organisation as part of the employee\nreferral programme. I decided to join Roche because of the nature of the\nbusiness \u2013 saving lives \u2013 which is very meaningful. Even though I\u2019m not on the\nfront line, I know I can contribute to the organisation, and save lives, in an\nindirect way through the people I bring in.\n\nAdditionally, when I came for the interview, I liked the atmosphere which\nseemed very positive. The overall feeling was that this is a really nice\norganisation and I think the culture and atmosphere is still the same today.\n\n**Q That\u2019s interesting, does moving from HR into the business happen very\noften?**\n\nMy predecessor started out from the business before moving into HR. It\u2019s part\nof how we develop people \u2013 by moving them through functions or through\ngeographies. It\u2019s also how we retain people \u2013 by giving them different\nexposure and allowing them to grow professionally and personally.\n\nWe have many cases of people who have moved into different jobs within the\norganisation, not necessarily in the same country. It\u2019s not uncommon to see\npeople in Roche being developed in this way, and for employees who are not so\nmobile, we also have other ways of developing them.\n\n**Q I understand that you have about 4,600 employees across APAC and about 230\nemployees in Singapore. What are your HR priorities for the next 12 months?**\n\nI have a 1,000-day plan which can be summarised into three key areas. The\nfirst is that we want to make Roche a great place to work, which is around\nengaging people. At the end of the day, a product is a product; what makes a\ndifference is the people, so it\u2019s about engaging people and making this a\nspecial place to work.\n\nThe second is about developing people. We have lots of programmes, global\nleadership programmes as well as programmes we do here regionally and locally.\nThe third is in terms of the leadership pipeline and how to ensure that when\nsomeone moves to the next job, the next person can step up. We might focus on\na different thing each year, but it\u2019s always on these three themes.\n\n**Q One of Roche\u2019s beliefs is that \u201cevery employee deserves a great leader\u201d\nand in fact, I found that in 2014, around 80% of Roche\u2019s key roles were filled\ninternally. How does Roche achieve this?**\n\nIf you look at it as a value chain, it\u2019s about hiring the right people to\nbegin with \u2013 people who share the same values (integrity, courage and passion)\nto do what is important for the patient and also demonstrate the right values\nwe have here as an organisation. It\u2019s also about having role models as well as\nthe training programmes that we put in place.\n\n> ##### Even though I\u2019m not on the front line, I know I can contribute to the\n> organisation, and save lives, in an indirect way through the people I bring\n> in.\n\nThere are different programmes that we put in place to make sure everybody\nbecomes a better leader. Roche, as an organisation, also talks about our\nleadership commitments. We specifically articulate what good leaders look like\nand we kind of put it in behavioural terms. It\u2019s not rocket science, but we\nwant to articulate it so that people are aware.\n\nWe have a number of leadership programmes that we run globally, regionally and\nlocally. One programme is run twice a year and is for someone who is\nrelatively new in their careers based on where they are in the organisation.\nWhen we feel they have shown potential and are about to become people\nmanagers, we put them through the assessment centre.\n\nUnder the assessment centre programme, they go through a two-and-a- half-day\nworkshop where they are put through simulated exercises such as having\ndifficult employee conversations just so they understand where their strengths\nand weaknesses lie. The leadership team observes them in these exercises and\ngives them feedback and coaching. Thereafter, the employees come up with their\nown individual development plan.\n\nThis is one way we show our commitment to our employees by developing them\neven before they become people managers. Some of the participants are already\npeople managers, but it\u2019s always good for them to re-evaluate themselves, see\nwhat they are good at and where they can improve.\n\nWe also run a programme where INSEAD customises the courseware for our general\nmanagers (GM) minus one level, as well as successors to our GM positions. This\nis a two-week programme that we\u2019ve held twice so far. It has two modules with\na fourmonth break in between. During the break, they have an action learning\nproject where they work on a project that is important for the business.\n\nLast year, we spent $100,000 on customisation fees on top of individual course\nfees and had the whole leadership team present to listen to the participants\u2019\naction learning outcomes. Those who were overseas join in if they happen to be\nin Singapore, and if not they dial in.\n\n**Q What are the metrics you go by when selecting employees for these\nprogrammes?**\n\nIt\u2019s more about who we feel will be a good leader. We put some of them in\nbecause we feel they have the potential to be GMs. We also put in those we\nfeel will benefit from the programme because they are strong performers and\nhave a large team. We come together during the leadership team meeting to make\nthese decisions, it\u2019s not just based on the decision of a single person.\n\n> ##### Last year, we spent $100,000 on customisation fees on top of\n> individual course fees and had the whole leadership team present to listen\n> to the participants\u2019 action learning outcomes.\n\nIn fact, at our recent meeting in Bangkok, we talked about our people for half\na day to share views about individuals. It\u2019s a shared view about how, who and\nwhere we want to invest and develop our people and there is a commitment from\nthe whole leadership team talking about employees and I think that it\ntranslates into our 80% internal fill rates. In fact, in Asia Pacific, six out\nof our last eight leadership roles over the past two years were filled\ninternally.\n\n**Q What is the business need for Roche to develop people into leadership\nroles and build succession pipelines?**\n\nFor the diagnostics industry, it\u2019s not like an FMCG product where it\u2019s easy\nfor everyone to pick up. Our business is very medically inclined and science-\ndriven so training our people takes time. So it\u2019s important for us to ensure\nthat when they become contributing members of the Roche organisation they have\nthe skills needed for people management because at the end of the day, they\nwill lead a large part of the organisation. We started the programmes to make\nsure that people become better leaders and not learn through the school of\nhard knocks.\n\nThe most recent programme \u2013 about leadership bench strength began two years\nago with INSEAD. We want to extend beyond just the leadership team \u2013 the MD of\nAPAC and the rest of his direct reports \u2013 hence, we worked with INSEAD to have\nbetter leadership development for people who are going to step up to the next\nrole.\n\n**Q Do you see any challenges when implementing these programmes?**\n\nThe challenges are more about the time commitment and how to take time out of\nthe organisation to do it. Our INSEAD programme is really intensive so the key\npiece is how they can manage the time commitment on top of their current job.\nTo help them commit to the programme, we impress upon them why we are doing\nthis and explain it\u2019s for their professional development.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of support from the leadership team who are also involved in the\nprogramme. When the participants present their action learning project, they\nare there to listen and provide support. Some leaders are also sponsors of\nprojects. The commitment by the leadership team is there, so it\u2019s more of\nworking to see how best they can manage their resource.\n\n**Q Does the leadership team also do mentoring?**\n\nWe do different things at different times. We have informal coaching that\nhappens all the time and it\u2019s part and parcel of every manager\u2019s job. We have\na mentoring programme which we call a sponsorship programme in two specific\nareas which we want to develop. One is from a gender diversity standpoint.\nWhile the other talks about how to get emerging market talent more exposure.\n\n**Q I understand Roche had a gender diversity target to have 20% of leaders in\ntop positions be women by 2014, but hit that target in 2013. How did you go\nabout doing that?**\n\nI think that locally, we do a lot better. If you look at the leadership team\nin this region, we have 25 members on the team and nine are female. That\ntranslates to about 36% of the leadership team here who are women. I think we\ndo a number of things to achieve that, some of which include our leadership\ntraining and our talent conversation.\n\n> ##### There is a commitment from the whole leadership team talking about\n> employees and I think that it translates into our 80% internal fill rates.\n\n**Q When you select candidates for the learning and development programmes, do\nyou have a quota for women?**\n\nWe don\u2019t have a quota for women, but the percentage of women in programmes\nsuch as the INSEAD programme mirrors that of our demographic \u2013 about 60% male,\n40% female as a region.\n\n**Q I understand Roche also uses developing people as a way to engage them. Do\nyou find this helps with the retention rates and how does it help?**\n\nPeople stay for a lot of different reasons. There is a saying that people join\nbecause of the company, they leave because of the manager and that\u2019s why we\nhave all this emphasis on the leadership programmes. Another aspect is the\ncareer development aspect and we have been able to keep our people through\nmany ways. For example, if you look at China, it\u2019s a fast-paced environment\nwith things changing rapidly and it\u2019s very common to see a 25% attrition rate\nthere, but in Roche Diagnostics, our attrition rate in China is at about 6%.\n\nPart of it is getting people to see our vision \u2013 improving patient outcomes by\ngiving physicians and patients the power of knowing through accurate and fast-\ntest results. We also want to do the right thing for employees so we have\nthings such as career progression. I think we are able to retain our people\nvery well through things like our culture and the programmes that we have.\n\n**Q Other than that, what results have you seen from these programmes?**\n\nThe internal fill rate of 80% is one. Another one is succession planning. For\nexample, in the past year, we had a total of eight leadership positions open\nand only two were filled externally, the other six were all internal and it\nwas part and parcel of what we talked about in the succession plan. Roche has\na very supportive leadership team when it comes to implementing HR policies\nand programmes, HR leaders in other companies might not be so lucky.\n\n**Q What advice do you have for HR leaders who are struggling to gain buy-in\nfrom their leadership team?**\n\nAt the beginning, it was more of a paper exercise. We started with talking\nabout what we wanted to do. Then we thought of how to communicate it to the\norganisation and present it as a business case \u2013 not just as a HR initiative.\nIt\u2019s about conveying this in a business language to ensure the managers sit up\nand listen. HR analytics is very important at showing the statistics.\n\nWhat we did was to show the engagement level of the people in the succession\nplan and how they compared to the rest of the organisation. We wanted to give\nthem a kind of burning platform and say that if you look at the engagement\nlevel of those people in the succession plan, it\u2019s not as high as compared to\nthe rest of the organisation (63%) and tell them it is a concern that we\u2019re\nnot engaging this group of people. We also tell them that these programmes are\nnot academic exercises and we talk about how our succession pipeline was able\nto help fill the recent eight leadership roles that were empty.\n\nThe next conversation we have is about how we can accelerate their readiness\nlevel. We\u2019re on a journey together with the business and it\u2019s important that\nwe present a business case to them and speak in the language of the business.\n\n_Art Direction: Shahrom Kamarulzaman;

It is one more\nsilhouette looming pier-side at Naval Base San Diego, a home port of the U.S.\nPacific Fleet. And the scene playing out in its forward compartment, as the\ncrew members ready themselves for departure, is as old as the Navy itself.\nThree sailors in blue coveralls heave on a massive rope. \u201cAvast!\u201d a fourth\nshouts.

Built in 2014 from 30 million cans\u2019\nworth of Alcoa aluminum, Littoral Combat Ship 10, the USS Gabrielle Giffords,\nrides high in the water on three separate hulls and is powered like a jet\nski\u2014that is, by water-breathing jets instead of propellers. This lets it move\nswiftly in the coastal shallows (or \u201clittorals,\u201d in seagoing parlance), where\nit\u2019s meant to dominate. Unlike the older ships now gliding past\u2014guided-missile\ncruisers, destroyers, amphibious transports\u2014the littoral combat ship was built\non the concept of \u201cmodularity.\u201d There\u2019s a voluminous hollow in the ship\u2019s\nbelly, and its insides can be swapped out in port, allowing it to set sail as\na submarine hunter, minesweeper, or surface combatant, depending on the\nmission.\n\nThe ship\u2019s most futuristic aspect, though, is its crew. The LCS was the first\nclass of Navy ship that, because of technological change and the high cost of\npersonnel, turned away from specialists in favor of \u201chybrid sailors\u201d who have\nthe ability to acquire skills rapidly. It was designed to operate with a mere\n40 souls on board\u2014one-fifth the number aboard comparably sized \u201clegacy\u201d ships\nand a far cry from the 350 aboard a World War II destroyer. The small size of\nthe crew means that each sailor must be like the ship itself: a jack of many\ntrades and not, as 240 years of tradition have prescribed, a master of just\none.\n\nOn most Navy ships, only a boatswain\u2019s mate\u2014the oldest of the Navy\u2019s 60-odd\noccupations\u2014would handle the ropes, which can quickly remove a finger or foot.\nBut none of the three sailors heaving on the Giffords\u2019s ropes is a line-\nhandling professional. One is an information-systems technician. The second is\na gunner\u2019s mate. And the third is a chef. \u201cWe wear a lot of hats here,\u201d\nCulinary Specialist 2nd Class Damontrae Butler says. After the ropes are put\naway, he reports to the ship\u2019s galley, picks up a basting brush, and starts\nreadying a tray of garlic bread for the oven.\n\nTwo boatswain\u2019s mates are on hand, but only to instruct and oversee\u2014and they\ntoo wear lots of hats, between them: fire-team leader, search-and-rescue\nswimmer, crane operator, deck patroller, helicopter-salvage coordinator. The\noperative concept is \u201cminimal manning.\u201d On the bridge, five crew members do\nthe jobs usually done by 12, thanks to high-tech display screens and the\nship\u2019s several thousand remote sensors. And belowdecks, once-distinct\nengineering roles\u2014electrician\u2019s mate, engine man, machinist, gas-turbine\ntechnician\u2014fall to the same handful of sailors.\n\nThe USS Gabrielle Giffords at dock in San Diego (Peter Bohler)\n\nMinimal manning\u2014and with it, the replacement of specialized workers with\nproblem-solving generalists\u2014isn\u2019t a particularly nautical concept. Indeed, it\nwill sound familiar to anyone in an organization who\u2019s been asked to \u201cdo more\nwith less\u201d\u2014which, these days, seems to be just about everyone. Ten years from\nnow, the Deloitte consultant Erica Volini projects, 70 to 90 percent of\nworkers will be in so-called hybrid jobs or superjobs\u2014that is, positions\ncombining tasks once performed by people in two or more traditional roles.\nVisit SkyWest Airlines\u2019 careers site, and you\u2019ll see that the company is\nlooking for \u201ccross utilized agents\u201d capable of ticketing, marshaling and\nservicing aircraft, and handling luggage. At the online shoe company Zappos,\nwhich famously did away with job titles a few years back, employees are\nencouraged to take on multiple roles by joining \u201ccircles\u201d that tackle\ndifferent responsibilities. If you ask Laszlo Bock, Google\u2019s former culture\nchief and now the head of the HR start-up Humu, what he looks for in a new\nhire, he\u2019ll tell you \u201cmental agility.\u201d \u201cWhat companies are looking for,\u201d says\nMary Jo King, the president of the National R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Writers\u2019 Association, \u201cis\nsomeone who can be all, do all, and pivot on a dime to solve any problem.\u201d\n\nThe phenomenon is sped by automation, which usurps routine tasks, leaving\nemployees to handle the nonroutine and unanticipated\u2014and the continued advance\nof which throws the skills employers value into flux. It would be supremely\nironic if the advance of the knowledge economy had the effect of devaluing\nknowledge. But that\u2019s what I heard, recurrently, while reporting this story.\n\u201cThe half-life of skills is getting shorter,\u201d I was told by IBM\u2019s Joanna Daly,\nwho oversaw an apprenticeship program that trained tech employees for new jobs\nwithin the company in as few as six months. By 2020, [a 2016 World Economic\nForum report predicted](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs.pdf),\n\u201cmore than one-third of the desired core skill sets of most occupations\u201d will\nnot have been seen as crucial to the job when the report was published. If\nthat\u2019s the case, I asked John Sullivan, a prominent Silicon Valley talent\nadviser, why should anyone take the time to master anything at all? \u201cYou\nshouldn\u2019t!\u201d he replied.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, statements out of Silicon Valley should be deflated by\nhalf to control for hyperbole. Still, the ramifications of Sullivan\u2019s comment\nunfurl quickly. Minimal manning\u2014and the evolution of the economy more\ngenerally\u2014requires a different kind of worker, with not only different\nacquired skills but different inherent abilities. It has implications for the\nnature and utility of a college education, for the path of careers, for\ninequality and employability\u2014even for the generational divide. And that\u2019s to\nsay nothing of its potential impact on product quality and worker safety, or\non the nature of the satisfactions one might derive from work. Or, for that\nmatter, on the relevance of the question _What do you want to be when you grow\nup?_\n\nHow deep these implications go depends, ultimately, on how closely employers\nembrace the concepts behind minimal manning. The Navy, curiously, has pushed\nthe idea forward with an abandon unseen anywhere on land. Within a few years,\n35 littoral combat ships will be afloat, along with three minimally manned\ndestroyers of the new Zumwalt class. The effort seemed to me a good test case\nfor the broader questions bedeviling the economy: Can a few brilliant, quick-\nthinking generalists really replace a fleet of specialists? Is the value of\ntrue expertise in serious decline?\n\n[Read: The case against\nspecialists](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/05/david-epstein-\nrange/590704/)\n\nI wanted to try to answer these questions\u2014which is why, that morning in San\nDiego, I joined the crew of the Giffords as it prepared to set sail.\n\nA warship is, in the words of [one Navy\nanalysis](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a567261.pdf), a highly\ncomplicated \u201csocio-technical system.\u201d It operates in an environment that is\noften hostile, even outside of war; its crew\u2014isolated by vast waters\u2014must be\nready for every eventuality. Traditionally, navies handled this by staffing\ntheir ships amply. Spain\u2019s wood-and-sail Sant\u00edsima Trinidad carried upwards of\n1,000 men at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, providing redundancy in the face\nof any contingency. If one system failed, there was a backup. This may not\nhave been efficient, but it was effective. The U.S. Navy adopted that model\nlong ago\u2014and has not lost a ship in combat since the Korean War.\n\nBut the end of the draft, in 1973, brought rising labor costs and, with them,\na shift in thinking. \u201cFor my entire 39-year career,\u201d the late Admiral Jeremy\nBoorda said in the early \u201990s, \u201cwe always talked about buying ships and\nmanning them with people \u2026 I think we need to think about things differently\nnow. We need to figure out how to have the fewest number of people possible,\nand then build [ships] to make them as effective as they need to be.\u201d\n\nIn 2001, Donald Rumsfeld arrived at the Pentagon, carrying with him a\nbriefcase full of ideas from the corporate world: downsizing, reengineering,\n\u201ctransformational\u201d technologies.\n\nIn 1995, Boorda converted an aging cruiser, the USS Yorktown, into an\nexperimental \u201csmart ship\u201d on which watches were combined, engine rooms were\nunmanned, and sailors communicated by handheld radio instead of stationary\ntelephones. The result was promising but modest: a 4 percent reduction in crew\nsize. A series of naval reports concluded that \u201cbig dollar savings\u201d could be\nachieved only with more significant changes, including greater automation and\nthe selection and training of \u201cgeneralists rather than specialists.\u201d\n\nThen, in 2001, Donald Rumsfeld arrived at the Pentagon. The new secretary of\ndefense carried with him a briefcase full of ideas from the corporate world:\ndownsizing, reengineering, \u201ctransformational\u201d technologies. Almost\nimmediately, what had been an experimental concept became an article of faith.\nIn what Ronald O\u2019Rourke of the Congressional Research Service has called \u201can\nanalytical virgin birth,\u201d the Navy committed itself to developing the littoral\ncombat ship and the Zumwalt-class destroyer, using the principles of minimal\nmanning. The LCS came first, partly because it borrowed an Australian design\nfor a passenger ferry and could therefore boost the fleet size quickly.\n\n\u201cI think when the Navy started off, they had a really good plan,\u201d Paul\nFrancis, of the Government Accountability Office, [told the Senate in\n2016](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-114shrg28323/html/CHRG-114shrg28323.htm).\n\u201cThey were going to build two ships, experimental ships.\u201d But in 2005, having\nassured itself that \u201coptimal manning works,\u201d the Navy decided to skip the\nexperimentation and move straight to construction. From this point on,\nwhenever the Navy tried to study the feasibility of minimal manning, its\nanalysis was colored by the fact that\u2014on these ships, at least\u2014it _had_ to\nwork. Dozens of littoral combat ships were on their way. The Giffords was the\n10th to deploy.\n\nAs the skyline of downtown San Diego receded in the distance, we found\nourselves approaching a pier that lay along the final extremity of land before\nthe open Pacific. Shimmering far off to the left was Coronado Beach, the\nlegendary training site for Navy SEALs. To the right was the tower of a\nnuclear submarine. Our mission for the day was to unload ammunition from the\nship to an onshore supply base.\n\nOn deck I spotted a man holding a pair of high-tech binoculars and calling out\ndistances: \u201cThree hundred yards. Two hundred yards.\u201d Turns out it was Butler,\nwho, in addition to his other jobs, was working to become a certified lookout.\n\u201cYou have to be adaptable, very adaptable to the circumstances, or things can\nreally take a turn in a different direction,\u201d he told me, while estimating the\ndistance and bearing of an approaching yacht under the tutelage of another\nsailor. \u201cFor me, that means thinking about the task you\u2019re doing, not the task\nyou\u2019ll have to do.\u201d That is: not dwelling on the garlic bread in the oven.\n\u201cAnd asking the right questions. Uh, 500 yards?\u201d He checked his eyeball\nestimate with the range finder. \u201cFive hundred yards.\u201d\n\nWhat other jobs did he have? Should a fire break out, Butler said, he would\nbecome a \u201cboundaryman\u201d and work to stop the spread of smoke to other\ncompartments\u2014a job that, on another ship, would be supervised by a full-time\ndamage-control specialist. The LCS has only two of these\u2014which is one reason\nit has a \u201csurvivability\u201d rating of 1, the lowest score possible. If the ship\nis critically struck, crew members are expected to simply abandon ship and\nescape. Traditionalists hate the idea.\n\nCulinary Specialist 2nd Class Damontrae Butler works on deck and in the\nkitchen. (Peter Bohler)\n\nButler wasn\u2019t the only character to reappear in different form. During an all-\nhands meeting\u2014the smallness of the group exaggerated by the large size of the\nflight deck they stood on\u2014someone pointed to the figure strolling in from\nstage right. It was one of the two boatswain\u2019s mates who had been overseeing\nthe line-handlers that morning. He had swapped his blue coveralls for head-to-\ntoe green camo, and was walking back and forth, appearing to survey the upper\ndeck of the ship. Such costume changes gave the whole ship the feel of a small\ntheater troupe in which the actor playing the prince\u2019s cousin also plays the\napothecary, the friar, and Messenger No. 2.\n\nThe Navy knew early on that not just anyone could handle this kind of\nmultitasking. By the early 2000s, the Office of Naval Research was\ncommissioning studies on how to select and prepare a crew for the new ships.\nOne of the academics brought in was Zachary Hambrick, a psychology professor\nat Michigan State University. Instead of trying to understand how well naval\ncandidates might master fixed skills, Hambrick began to examine how they\nperformed in what are known as fluid-task environments. \u201cWe wanted to identify\ncharacteristics of people who could flexibly shift,\u201d he told me. To that end,\nin 2010 he administered a test to sailors at Naval Station Great Lakes\u2014and\nwhen I traveled to Michigan State to find out more about his work, he invited\nme to give it a try.\n\nIn Hambrick\u2019s Expertise Lab, I sat before [a screen divided into\nquadrants](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220014605_The_Relationship_Between_the_ASVAB_and_Multitasking_in_Navy_Sailors_A_Process-\nSpecific_Approach): One showed me a fuel gauge that I had to monitor; another\ndisplayed a set of letters I had to memorize; another gave me a set of numbers\nto add together; and the final one presented me with a red button to push\nwhenever a high-pitched tone sounded. All four tasks contributed equally to my\ntotal score, which appeared at the center of the screen. Because there really\nis no such thing as multitasking\u2014just a rapid switching of attention\u2014I began\nto feel overstrained, put upon, and finally irked by the impossible set of\nconcurrent demands. _Shouldn\u2019t someone be giving me a hand here?_ This,\nHambrick explained, meant I was hitting the limits of working\nmemory\u2014basically, raw processing power\u2014which is an important aspect of \u201cfluid\nintelligence\u201d and peaks in your early 20s. This is distinct from \u201ccrystallized\nintelligence\u201d\u2014the accumulated facts and know-how on your hard drive\u2014which\npeaks in your 50s. In a setting where the possession of know-how is trumped by\nthe ability to acquire it quickly, as in Hambrick\u2019s game, fluid intelligence\nis paramount. (For more on fluid and crystallized intelligence, see \u201cYour\nProfessional Decline Is Coming (Much) Sooner Than You Think,\u201d by Arthur C.\nBrooks, on page 66.)\n\nWhen the sailors at Naval Station Great Lakes took the test, they were thrown\na curveball that I was not: In the middle of the test, the scoring system\nsuddenly changed, so that one quadrant now accounted for 75 percent of the\nscore. Some sailors, Hambrick told me, were quick to spot the change and\nrefocus their attention accordingly. They tended to test high in fluid\nintelligence. Others noticed the change but continued to devote equal\nattention to all four tasks. Their scores fell. This group, Hambrick found,\nwas high in \u201cconscientiousness\u201d\u2014a trait that\u2019s normally an overwhelming\npredictor of positive job performance. We like conscientious people because\nthey can be trusted to show up early, double-check the math, fill the gap in\nthe presentation, and return your car gassed up even though the tank was\nnowhere near empty to begin with. What struck Hambrick as counterintuitive and\ninteresting was that conscientiousness here seemed to correlate with _poor_\nperformance.\n\nSailors on the Navy\u2019s new littoral combat ships must be able to carry out\nmultiple jobs; the operative concept is \u201cminimal manning.\u201d (Peter Bohler)\n\nHambrick wasn\u2019t the only one to observe this correlation. While Jeffery\nLePine, an Arizona State management professor and former Air Force officer,\nwas doing Navy-funded research on decision making in the late 1990s, he used a\ncomputer game a lot like the one Hambrick administered. The tasks were\nexplicitly military (for instance, assessing the \u201cthreat level\u201d of 75 aircraft\nbased on speed, altitude, range, etc.) but the curveball was similar:\nUnbeknownst to the participants, the scoring rules changed partway through the\ngame. When this happened, he noticed that players who scored high on\nconscientiousness did worse. Instead of adapting to the new rules, they kept\ndoing what they were doing, only more intently, and this impeded their\nperformance. They were the victims of their own dogged persistence. \u201cI think\nof it as the person literally going down with a sinking ship,\u201d LePine told me.\n\nAnd he [discovered another\ncorrelation](https://media.terry.uga.edu/socrates/publications/2013/06/LePineColquittErez2000.pdf)\nin his test: The people who did best tended to score high on \u201copenness to new\nexperience\u201d\u2014a personality trait that is normally not a major job-performance\npredictor and that, in certain contexts, roughly translates to\n\u201cdistractibility.\u201d To borrow the management expert Peter Drucker\u2019s\nformulation, people with this trait are less focused on doing things right,\nand more likely to wonder whether they\u2019re doing the right things.\n\nHigh in fluid intelligence, low in experience, not terribly conscientious,\nopen to potential distraction\u2014this is not the classic profile of a winning job\ncandidate. But what if it _is_ the profile of the winning job candidate of the\nfuture? If that\u2019s the case, some important implications would arise.\n\nOne concerns \u201cgrit\u201d\u2014a mind-set, much vaunted these days in educational and\nprofessional circles, that allows people to commit tenaciously to doing one\nthing well. Angela Duckworth, a University of Pennsylvania psychology\nprofessor, has written powerfully about the value of grit\u2014putting your head\ndown, blocking out distractions, committing over a course of many years to a\nchosen path. Her writing traces an intellectual lineage that can also be found\nin Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s _Outliers_ , which explains extraordinary success as a\nfunction of endless, dedicated practice\u201410,000 hours or more. These ideas are\ninherently appealing; they suggest that dedication can be more important than\nraw talent, that the dogged and conscientious will be rewarded in the end.\n\nIn the stable environments Duckworth and Gladwell draw from (chess, tennis,\npiano, higher education), a rigid adherence to routine can no doubt serve you\nwell. But in situations with rapidly changing rules and roles, a small but\ngrowing body of evidence now suggests that it can leave you ill-equipped.\n\nPaul Bartone, a retired Army colonel, seemed to find as much when he studied\nWest Point students and graduates. Traditional measures such as SAT scores and\nhigh-school class rank \u201cpredicted leader performance in the stable, highly\nregulated environment of West Point\u201d itself. But once cadets got into actual\ncommand environments, which tend to be fluid and full of surprises, a\ndifferent picture emerged. \u201cPsychological hardiness\u201d\u2014a construct that\nincludes, among other things, a willingness to explore \u201cmultiple possible\nresponse alternatives,\u201d a tendency to \u201csee all experience as interesting and\nmeaningful,\u201d and a strong sense of self-confidence\u2014[was a better predictor of\nleadership ability in\nofficers](https://www.academia.edu/15760334/Psychological_Hardiness_Predicts_Adaptability_in_Military_Leaders_A_prospective_study)\nafter three years in the field. Thus, Bartone and his co-authors wrote,\n\u201ctraditional predictors [of performance] appear not to hold in the fast-paced\nand unpredictable operational environment in which military officers are\nworking today.\u201d\n\nThe whole ship had the feel of a small theater troupe in which the actor\nplaying the prince\u2019s cousin also plays the apothecary, the friar, and\nMessenger No. 2.\n\nThe world of work is full of such surprises. And as the rules change, so do\nideas about what makes a good worker. \u201cFluid, learning-intensive environments\nare going to require different traits than classical business environments,\u201d I\nwas told by Frida Polli, a co-founder of an AI-powered hiring platform called\nPymetrics. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to be things like ability to learn quickly from\nmistakes, use of trial and error, and comfort with ambiguity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see a big shift,\u201d says Guy Halfteck, a people-analytics\nexpert. \u201cEmployers are looking less at what you know and more and more at your\nhidden potential\u201d to learn new things. His advice to employers? Stop hiring\npeople based on their work experience. Because in these environments,\nexpertise can become an obstacle. That was the finding of a 2015 study carried\nout by the Yale researchers Matthew Fisher and Frank Keil, titled \u201cThe Curse\nof Expertise.\u201d The more we invest in building and embellishing a system of\nknowledge, they found, the more averse we become to unbuilding it.\n\nJeffery LePine has observed this phenomenon in another part of his life. For\nyears, he devoted himself to understanding cars, and amassed a collection of\nPontiacs that he maintained himself. But new developments\u2014fuel injection and\nthe like\u2014convinced him that at times he needed expert help. When one of his\ncars developed a leaky engine, he called in a mechanic whose first attempt to\nfix the problem was to replace the rear oil seal. The leak persisted, so the\nmechanic replaced the engine and gave it a new oil seal. Still no luck, so he\nreplaced the whole thing again. Finally, the mechanic read the instructions\nthat came with the oil seal\u2014something a novice would have done at the\noutset\u2014and learned that newer engines required an extra step. By not doing it,\nhe\u2019d been puncturing the seals and causing new leaks himself.\n\nThe Yale study nicely summed up the dynamic at play here: All too often\nexperts, like the mechanic in LePine\u2019s garage, [fail to inspect their\nknowledge structure for signs of\ndecay](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.12280). \u201cIt just\ndidn\u2019t occur to him,\u201d LePine said, \u201cthat he was repeating the same mistake\nover and over.\u201d\n\nYet the limitations of curious, fluidly intelligent groups of generalists\nquickly become apparent in the real world. The devaluation of expertise opens\nup ample room for different sorts of mistakes\u2014and sometimes creates a kind of\nhelplessness.\n\nAboard littoral combat ships, the crew lacks the expertise to carry out some\nimportant tasks, and instead has to rely on civilian help. A malfunctioning\ncrane on board one LCS, for example, meant that the crew had to summon an\nexpert to solve the problem, and then had to wait four days for him to arrive.\n\nThere have been other incidents. Because of a design flaw, the [LCS engines\nstarted to corrode](https://www.wired.com/2011/06/shipbuilder-blames-navy-as-\nbrand-new-warship-disintegrates/) not long after the fleet\u2019s launch, but for a\nlong time nobody on board noticed, which led to costly delays and repairs.\nWhen a congressional oversight committee found out about the problem in 2011,\nit called the ships\u2019 crews to task. Who was in charge of checking the engines?\nThe answer was \u2026 nobody. The engine rooms were unmanned by design. Meanwhile,\nthe modular \u201cplug and fight\u201d configuration was not panning out as hoped.\nConverting a ship from sub-hunter to minesweeper or minesweeper to surface\ncombatant, it turned out, was a logistical nightmare. Variants of all three\n\u201cmission packages\u201d had to be stocked at far-flung ports; an extra detachment\nof 20-plus sailors had to stand ready to embark with each. More to the point,\nin order to enable quick mastery by generalists, the technologies on each had\nto be user-friendly\u2014which they were not. So in 2016 the concept of\ninterchangeability was scuttled for a \u201cone ship, one mission\u201d approach, in\nwhich the extra 20-plus sailors became permanent crew members.\n\nOn it went. The crew of one LCS failed to oil the main engine gear (forcing\nthe ship to limp home from Singapore for a $23 million repair). The crew of\nanother put a seal in the wrong hole, flooding its engine with seawater. \u201c[Who\nwas responsible for the\ntraining?](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-114shrg28323/html/CHRG-114shrg28323.htm)\u201d\nthe late Senator John McCain asked angrily at a hearing. \u201cWasn\u2019t someone?\u201d\n\nA chastened naval command quietly ordered all LCSs to stand down for several\nmonths in 2016, sent their engineering crews back to school for\nrequalification, and bulked up its high-tech courseware, which lets LCS\ntrainees practice tasks on a highly detailed virtual ship. (\u201cI\u2019m going to show\nyou the stern tube-shaft seal assembly,\u201d a virtual officer announces in one\ntraining video, by way of greeting.) Onboard routines were updated to include\nmore oversight and double-checking. The ship passed its sea trials, but not\nwith flying colors. \u201cAs equipment breaks, [sailors] are required to fix it\nwithout any training,\u201d a Defense Department Test and Evaluation employee told\nCongress. \u201cThose are not my words. Those are the words of the sailors who were\ndoing the best they could to try to accomplish the missions we gave them in\ntesting.\u201d The intentionally small crew size made the ship ill-suited to\nforward combat, because not enough people were on board to stand watch.\n\nThese results were, perhaps, predictable given the Navy\u2019s initial, full-\nthrottle approach to minimal manning\u2014and are an object lesson on the dangers\nof embracing any radical concept without thinking hard enough about the\ndownsides. Even if minimal manning works for a given business or institution,\nthe ramifications for society may not be entirely salubrious. Grit and 10,000\nhours of training are appealing in part because they reinforce American self-\nconceptions that have been present since the country\u2019s founding, ideas about\nequality of opportunity, about the value of knowledge, about the importance of\nhard work. And while no one would suggest that effort itself is being devalued\ntoday\u2014hard work is just as important in the workplace that\u2019s emerging as in\nthe one that\u2019s receding\u2014a world in which mental agility and raw cognitive\nspeed eclipse hard-won expertise is a world of greater exclusion: of older\nworkers, slower learners, and the less socially adept. \u201cThis sounds absurd,\u201d\nretired Vice Admiral Pete Daly (now head of the U.S. Naval Institute) told me,\n\u201cbut if you keep going down this road, you end up with one really expensive\nship with just a few people on it who are geniuses \u2026 That\u2019s not a future we\nwant to see, because you need a large enough crew to conduct multiple tasks in\ncombat.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s a future we may need to see. As the cost of computing continues to\nfall and artificial intelligence usurps more and more human competencies, the\ncollapse of old jobs into new ones seems preferable to their total\ndisappearance. (Look at the unmanned helicopter the Giffords can accommodate,\nand it\u2019s distressingly easy to picture a sailorless ship. Already, the DOD\nworries about the vulnerability of an LCS to \u201c[swarm\nboats](https://gcaptain.com/u-s-navys-lcs-struggles-in-to-fend-off-swarm-\nattack-tests-show/)\u201d\u2014basically, dozens of explosive-laden speedboats, unmanned\nand computer-coordinated.)\n\nAnd while it seems fair to say that the Navy pushed the LCS forward too hard\nand too heedlessly, calling its minimal-manning project a failure would be\npremature. The viability of the aircraft carrier was not obvious to military\nplanners in the 1920s, but then, through an extended process of on-site trial\nand error, engineers added catapults and arresting wires, and reconfigured\nflight decks, all of which turned an interesting idea into reality. The LCS is\nlikewise the scene of everyday trial, error, and adjustment.\n\nWhen large vessels stop to dock, for example, they have to be tied up with\nropes that are too heavy to throw. So sailors on board throw out smaller ropes\nthat are attached to the big ones, which their colleagues on land can then\npull over. On traditional Navy ships, this is done from a ship\u2019s top deck\u2014a\nsailor tosses the small rope over the side, and the rest is easy. This is how\nit\u2019s taught at the Navy\u2019s equivalent of boot camp, on a mock wooden ship near\nLake Michigan. But on the LCS the ropes reside in the forward compartment,\nwhere getting a good side-arm throw out the porthole is next to impossible.\nOne early solution\u2014sending a boatswain\u2019s mate up top to make the toss\u2014proved\nboth awkward and complicated. But this is where having a crew attracted to\nnovel problems is useful. At some point, a sailor had the idea of not throwing\nbut launching the line through the porthole. This unknown soul started\nfiddling with materials at hand, and lo, the \u201cslingshot\u201d came into being: a\nrubber bungee cord knotted into an X around four carabiners that clip to the\ninside of a porthole and, when pulled back and then released, have enough\nstrength to send a bundle of rope to a sailor waiting for it on land. A\ntriumph of found materials, it\u2019s an indication, however small, of what a group\nof open-minded generalists can achieve: namely, inventing new patterns of\nworking that turn a lack of expertise into an asset.\n\nPeter Bohler\n\nWhat does all this mean for those of us in the workforce, and those of us\nplanning to enter it? It would be wrong to say that the 10,000-hours-of-\ndeliberate-practice idea doesn\u2019t hold up at all. In some situations, it\nclearly does. Sports, musicianship, teaching\u2014these are fields where the rules\ndon\u2019t change much over time. In tennis, it pays to put in the hours mastering\nyour serve, because you know you\u2019ll always be serving to a box 21 feet long\nand 13.5 feet wide, over a net strung 3.5 feet high. In medicine and law, the\nrules might change\u2014but specialization will probably remain key. A spinal\nsurgery will not be performed by a brilliant dermatologist. A criminal-defense\nteam will not be headed by a tax attorney. And in tech, the demand for\nspecialized skills will continue to reward expertise handsomely.\n\nBut in many fields, the path to success isn\u2019t so clear. The rules keep\nchanging, which means that highly focused practice has a much lower return.\nZachary Hambrick and his co-authors showed as much [in a 2014 meta-\nanalysis](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Macnamara-\net-al.-2014.pdf). In uncertain environments, Hambrick told me, \u201cspecialization\nis no longer the coin of the realm.\u201d\n\nSo where does this leave us?\n\nBuilding a professional identity takes a lot of resources\u2014money, time, energy.\nAfter it\u2019s built, we expect to reap gains from our investment. Are we equipped\nto continually return to apprentice mode?\n\nIt leaves us with _lifelong learning_ , an unavoidably familiar phrase that,\nbefore I began this story, sounded tame to me\u2014a motivational reminder that\nit\u2019s never too late to learn Spanish or enroll in nighttime pottery classes.\nBut when Guillermo Miranda, IBM\u2019s former chief learning officer, used the term\nin describing to me how employees take advantage of the company\u2019s automated\ncareer counselor, Myca, it started to sound like something new. \u201cYou can talk\nto the chatbot,\u201d Miranda said, \u201cand say, \u2018Hey, Myca, how do I get a\npromotion?\u2019 \u201d\n\nMyca isn\u2019t programmed to push any fixed career track. It isn\u2019t dumb enough to\ntry to predict the future\u2014much less _plan_ for it. \u201cThere is no master plan,\u201d\nMiranda said. Myca just crunches data, notices correlations, and offers\nsuggestions: Take a course on blockchain. Learn quantum computing. \u201cLook,\nJennifer!\u201d it might say. \u201cThree people like you just got promoted because they\ngot these badges.\u201d\n\nEven as I reported this story, I found myself the target of career\nsuggestions. \u201cYou need to be a video guy, an audio guy!\u201d the Silicon Valley\ntalent adviser John Sullivan told me, alluding to the demise of print media. I\nfound it fascinating and slightly odd that Sullivan would so readily imagine\nthat I would abandon writing\u2014my life\u2019s pursuit since high school\u2014for a new\nline of work. More than that, though, I found the prospect of starting over\njust plain exhausting. Building a professional identity takes a lot of\nresources\u2014money, time, energy. After it\u2019s built, we expect to reap gains from\nour investment, and\u2014let\u2019s be honest\u2014even do a bit of coasting. Are we equipped\nto continually return to apprentice mode? Will this burn us out? And will the\ncollective work that results be as good as what came before?\n\nA junior officer steers the ship back into port; on the Giffords, even a\nroutine transit back to base is a chance to learn something new. (Peter\nBohler)\n\nThose are questions for the long haul. In 20 years, we\u2019ll know a lot more\nabout the costs and benefits of minimal manning and lifelong learning. But\nnobody on the Giffords was pondering that after the crew finished its\nunloading job. They had to get back to base. So 26 crew members crammed into a\nbriefing room, where they talked tides, collision avoidance, and sea lanes,\nwhich would be crawling with pleasure craft this time of day. \u201cIf action\nbecomes necessary,\u201d said the captain, Shawn Cowan, \u201ctake action early.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n####  Related Stories\n\n[\n![](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/9UmcPlJlA907o7AH9VBU2tCqX2g=/44x0:1337x800/250x155/media/img/2014/12/WEL_Fallows_Opener_v1_WEBCrop/original.jpg)](/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-\ntragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/)\n\n  * [The Tragedy of the American Military](/magazine/archive/2015/01/the-tragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/)\n  * [How a New Jobless Era Will Transform America](/magazine/archive/2010/03/how-a-new-jobless-era-will-transform-america/307919/)\n  * [The Case Against Grit](/family/archive/2019/05/david-epstein-range/590704/)\n\n* * *\n\nThe ship\u2019s bridge was quiet on the way home. As we sailed, I thought back to\nan encounter I\u2019d had earlier in the day with two engineer\u2019s mates. I\u2019d found\nthem in a quiet corner of the cargo bay, testing water samples pulled from the\nship\u2019s engines for signs of corrosion. We struck up a conversation, and they\nexplained to me that their responsibilities also included maintaining the\nship\u2019s gas turbines, diesel engines, water jets, and various pumps\u2014for oil,\nfuel, drinking water. I told them that sounded like a lot. They agreed, but\nthen one of them added that doing so many things was just the way things go in\n\u201cthis LCS business.\u201d Not only that, he added, but he was learning so much that\nhe might soon earn a promotion that would put him up on the bridge, in charge\nof the whole propulsion system.\n\nEverybody I met on the Giffords seemed to share that mentality. They regarded\nevery minute on board\u2014even during a routine transit back to port in San Diego\nHarbor\u2014as a chance to learn something new. Which is why, near the end of our\ntrip, as we approached the Coronado Bridge, Captain Cowan gave the helm to a\njunior officer and asked her to steer us under the bridge and into port. The\nofficer looked intently at the nozzles of the ship\u2019s four water jets, took in\nthe sight of the approaching bridge, and said, \u201cVery well, Captain.\u201d\n\nThen she adjusted her course.\n\n* * *\n\n _This article appears in the July 2019 print edition with the headline \u201cThe\nEnd of Expertise.\u201d_\n\n[Jerry Useem](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/jerry-useem/) is a\ncontributing writer at _The Atlantic_ and has covered business and economics\nfor _The New York Times_ , _Fortune_ , and other publications.\n\n  * About\n\n    * [Our History](/history/)\n    * [Staff](/masthead/)\n    * [Careers](/jobs/)\n\n  * Contact\n\n    * [Help Center](https://support.theatlantic.com/)\n    * [Contact Us](/contact/)\n    * [Advertise](/advertise/)\n    * [Press](/press/)\n\n  * Podcasts\n\n    * [Social Distance\u2122](/podcasts/socialdistance/)\n    * [Floodlines](/podcasts/floodlines/)\n    * [The Ticket: Politics from _The Atlantic_](/podcasts/the-ticket/)\n    * [Crazy/Genius](/podcasts/crazygenius/)\n\n  * Subscription\n\n    * [Purchase](/subscribe/footer-cover/)\n    * [Give a Gift](/subscribe/footer-gift/)\n    * [Manage Subscription](https://accounts.theatlantic.com)\n    * [Download iOS App](/app/)\n    * [Newsletters](/newsletters/sign-up/)\n\n  * Follow\n\n    * [](https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlantic \"Like us on Facebook\")\n    * [](https://www.instagram.com/theatlantic \"Follow us on Instagram\")\n    * [](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAtlantic \"Subscribe on YouTube\")\n    * [](https://twitter.com/TheAtlantic \"Follow us on Twitter\")\n    * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-atlantic \"Connect with us on LinkedIn\")\n    * [](https://flipboard.com/@theatlantic \"Follow us on Flipboard\")\n    * [](/feed/all/ \"Subscribe to our RSS feed\")\n\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/)\n  * [Do Not Sell My Personal Information](/do-not-sell-my-personal-information/)\n  * [Advertising Guidelines](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/front/docs/ads/TheAtlanticAdvertisingGuidelines.pdf?v1)\n  * [Terms Conditions](/terms-and-conditions/)\n  * [Responsible Disclosure](/responsible-disclosure-policy/)\n  * [Site Map](/site-map/)\n\nTheAtlantic.com Copyright (c) 2020 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.

of\nCybersecurity](https://cdn.smartbrief.com/sites/default/files/styles/originals_full_summary_banner_style/public/original-\ncontent/editor-in-chief-1.jpg?itok=oM4LZ5ce)\n\nCybercrime

daily cybersecurity news briefing today,\nfree._](https://www2.smartbrief.com/signupSystem/subscribe.action?pageSequence=1&briefName=cyber&campaign=ad_organic_seo_2019)\n\nThe events of the present can often tell us a lot about the future. For a look\ninto what the cybersecurity landscape could look like in the coming decade, we\nspoke with an expert who has had his finger on the pulse of the industry for\nthe past 20 years.\n\nSteve Morgan is founder and CEO at Cybersecurity Ventures and editor-in-chief\nat [Cybercrime Magazine](https://cybersecurityventures.com/our-company/). The\n[cybersecurity research](https://cybersecurityventures.com/research/)\nconducted by his firm is widely used by tech companies across the industry.\n\nIn our conversation, we discussed hot topics like artificial intelligence,\npersonal data protection and the new wave of privacy laws taking effect in\nCalifornia and the European Union. Here\u2019s the interview.\n\n## This week, a story broke about Microsoft having exposed data of 250 million\ncustomers over 14 years. Should companies with massive amounts of personally\nidentifiable information face bigger consequences for negligent behavior?\n\nThe media has a tendency to sensationalize data breaches and cyberintrusions.\nSometimes, the media will even take an incident and characterize it in a way\nwhere exposed data sounds like stolen data or even worse.\n\nIn my opinion, Microsoft shouldn\u2019t be called negligent. Cybersecurity always\nhas been and always will be a people problem. In this case, there was a\nmisconfiguration. Not to minimize the magnitude of the misconfiguration -- it\ndid, in fact, expose a massive amount of data.\n\n[But upon learning of it, Microsoft acted swiftly and did all of the right\nthings](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/01/22/access-misconfiguration-\nfor-customer-support-database/). They disclosed to the public exactly what\nhappened and they remediated the configuration. Microsoft also put their\nsenior cybersecurity leadership out in public to explain exactly what\noccurred.\n\nHonest, ethical companies will take accountability for their mistakes and\nlearn from them. The idea of punishing Microsoft or any company for a\nmisconfiguration, which unfortunately is common when it comes to database\nadministration and management, is unproductive for everyone concerned.\n\nHad Microsoft concealed the incident, or failed to take immediate action in\norder to remedy the misconfiguration upon learning of it, then that would be a\ndifferent story. It is worth noting that Microsoft invests more than $1\nbillion annually into cybersecurity and they are heavily involved with\nprotecting organizations of all sizes and types against cybercrime.\n\n## Are government regulations like CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and\nGDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) a net positive for consumers? How\nare businesses affected?\n\nHistorically, state and local government hasn\u2019t done anything to protect its\ncitizens' data and identities. CCPA is more than a net positive, it\u2019s a giant\nleap forward. Consumers should not have to be entirely on their own, without\nlaw enforcement, in cyberspace.\n\nFor businesses, it\u2019s either standard operating procedure or a nightmare. For\ncompanies that take governance, risk and compliance (GRC) seriously enough to\ndesignate an officer or an outside firm to advise on regulations as soon as\nthey are available to the public, then they are likely to comply and already\nhave the human resources in place to do so.\n\nBut for many companies, they ordinarily play catch-up when it comes to\ncompliance. That can lead to fines and even dire circumstances, such as\nconsumer lawsuits, which can force a small business to shut down. The\nimportance of complying to CCPA and GDPR cannot be overstated.\n\n## How important is AI and machine learning to the future of cybersecurity?\n\nCybersecurity Ventures predicts there will be [3.5 million unfilled\ncybersecurity jobs by 2021](https://cybersecurityventures.com/jobs), up from 1\nmillion positions in 2014. As the labor crisis in our field worsens, AI and\nmachine learning hold out great promise for eliminating some positions and\nincreasing productivity by an order of magnitude for others.\n\nBut the rub is that the world is facing a shortage of cybersecurity experts\nwho know how to effectively evaluate, deploy and make the best use of these\nadvanced technologies. AI and machine learning are not inherently\ncybersecurity technologies.\n\nSo, there\u2019s going to be a big learning curve for organizations that adapt them\nfor cyberdefense. There have been a myriad of groundbreaking cybersecurity\nsolutions brought to market over the past decade and they haven\u2019t reduced the\nworker shortage -- which remains our biggest problem.\n\n## What is the biggest cybersecurity threat to an average individual like me?\nWhat basic measures can I take to prevent an attack?\n\nThe biggest threat is that your email login credentials are for sale on the\ndark web. Once a cybercriminal has your email address and password, it can be\ngame over when you think about what\u2019s at stake.\n\nSifting through your email, what can a cyberthief find? More login credentials\nto your bank accounts, cryptocurrency accounts, retirement accounts and what\nelse? This is what you read about in the news every day because it is really\nhappening to people.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be a victim, then turn on MFA (multi-factor\nauthentication) a.k.a. 2FA (two-factor authentication) in your email and all\nother accounts. By doing this, a hacker will be asked for a secret code, in\naddition to your login ID and password, when attempting to access your email.\n\nThe code is texted to your cellphone when the login attempt is made. And only\nyou have the code.\n\nYour phone becomes a physical key to your email and other accounts. The other\nthing that you should do is to routinely change all of your passwords. Taking\nthese two measures will defeat a large percentage of personal cyberthreats\nthat you may be facing. [Here\u2019s a public service announcement I\nposted](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/urgent-warning-how-protect-every-lazy-\nus-citizen-from-steve-morgan/).\n\n## For those interested in a cybersecurity career, do you have any\nrecommendations on where to start?\n\nThat\u2019s a broad question because everyone is different in terms of how they\nlearn -- reading, watching videos, online courseware and classroom training.\nBut if someone has the aptitude for cyber, then they are probably a candidate\nfor online learning and I\u2019d recommend Cybrary, at\n[cybrary.it](https://www.cybrary.it/catalog/), as a starting point. It\nprovides free online cybersecurity training to anyone who wants it. It is an\nexcellent starting point, and I\u2019ve had great feedback from numerous people who\nhave gone to Cybrary.\n\n## What is the future of cybersecurity?\n\nThat\u2019s a question that gets a lot of hyped responses. But it shouldn\u2019t. What\nwe are witnessing is the ongoing development of an online society,\ncybercriminal activity and law enforcement -- no different than the evolution\nof offline society dating back to the beginning of time.\n\nThe big difference being how quickly the online world is developing. The more\npeople who settle in one place, the more bad apples you have to deal with. And\nthe more law enforcement that is required.\n\nCybersecurity Ventures predicts that the [number of humans on the Internet\nwill triple from 2015 to 2022 and reach 6\nbillion](https://cybersecurityventures.com/how-many-internet-users-will-the-\nworld-have-in-2022-and-in-2030/). And by 2030 that number will rise to 7.5\nbillion people.\n\nThe Internet is still very much like the Wild West. We lack local sheriffs and\npolice who can cyberprotect us. Businesses are highly dependent on themselves\nand the private sector for incident response, cyberinvestigation and\nforensics, and resolving cases.\n\nSo, what will the future look like? Law enforcement will inevitably catch up\nand one day we\u2019ll be able to dial 911 and report cybercrimes, the same as we\nwould for any other type of crime. We are inching toward that future already,\nwith local law enforcement in places such as New York City and Atlanta --\nwhere the police departments are heavily invested in new technology and\npersonnel around combating cybercrime.\n\nIf you enjoyed this deep dive into the future of the industry, you can\n[subscribe to SmartBrief on\nCybersecurity](https://www2.smartbrief.com/signupSystem/subscribe.action?pageSequence=1&briefName=cyber&campaign=ad_organic_seo_2019)\nfor more informative content.

That said, for those\nwith funds to cover costs that usually hover around $1,200 per classroom day,\nILT remains a great way to prepare for earning various IT certifications.\n\nThere is an increasingly large array of other options for your training and\ncertification needs. At the opposite end of the cost spectrum, self-study\nremains a favorite option to earn credentials. For those who are willing to\npay somewhere between those two options resides the increasingly wide range of\nonline training options.\n\nVarious training services providers now offer instructor-led online (ILO)\ntraining and online or stand-alone courseware and blended learning offerings,\nwhich mix video, text, simulations, labs, and other materials to cover a\ncombination of learning styles. E-learning refers to any kind of online\ninstructional encounter where no instructor is actively present and where\nstudents learn at their own pace.\n\nVirtual labs (vLabs) let students obtain hands-on training over the internet\nor via software simulations or virtualized and local runtime environments\n(although online vLabs are the most popular today). Online mentoring from some\ntraining providers gives students access to subject matter experts in the\ncertifications they're chasing. As a result, they can get questions answered\nand assistance with tricky issues or difficult concepts to make sure they\nmaster training materials and key topics.\n\nWhen considering IT certifications, note the continuing education (CE)\nrequirements for any certification that you pursue. Though CE requirements are\nnot part of your initial training regimen, most certifications require ongoing\neducation in order to stay abreast of new developments in the subject matter\ncovered by the certification. There's nothing more frustrating than having a\nhard-earned certification lapse because you didn't keep up with and satisfy\nthe CE requirements.\n\nOn the following pages, we examine a variety of IT training companies,\nincluding the following:\n\n  * Big global training companies\n  * Major high-tech corporations with certification programs and learning delivery organizations\n  * Training companies that specialize in information security and computer forensics\n\nThis collection of training organizations concludes with a grab bag of other\nmajor certification providers with strong training interests.\n\n## How to make the most of IT training\n\nDon't let the multitude of options distract you from your mission. Ultimately,\nthe best way to choose what's right for you is to research and compare user\nexperience, rankings, ratings and results.\n\nChances are good that your peers and colleagues have been both vocal and\ndetailed about their training experiences somewhere online. With a little\njudicious search engine work, you can uncover this information easily. When\nyou select a final pool of providers, use your search results to pick the\ntraining option that's best for you and your budget.\n\nFor those planning to take ILT courses, consider who will teach the class.\nLots of students deliberately delay their classes and even travel away from\nhome for up to a week (for most individual exam classes) or even two or three\nweeks (for most bootcamps or multiexam certification training packages), just\nto benefit from the wisdom and knowledge of esteemed instructors. Names like\nTodd Lammle or Wendell Odom for Cisco topics, Clement Dupuis for infosec\ntopics and Mark Minasi for Windows topics come to mind.\n\nBalance your budget against your skills, knowledge and motivation. Even though\nILT and ILO options abound, most candidates still self-study for\ncertifications that don't mandate courses. Even those certification candidates\nwho choose the ILT and ILO training options typically augment their formal\nclasses with self-study as part of preparing for certification exams.\n\nMy advice is to consider the urgency for earning a certification, your current\nexperience in the topics at hand and your available training budget when\npicking the right training for you.\n\n  * Bootcamps and ILT are usually the fastest path to obtaining a certification.\n  * Bootcamps and ILT are the best way to start from behind and still earn your cert, but with enough time and effort, self-study can also get you where you need to go.\n  * Self-study usually costs about 20% less than ILT. This means less to those whose employers provide full or partial funding for training outlays, but it still means something.\n\n## Multifocus IT training companies\n\nBig global training companies certainly offer the most complex, diverse and\nsophisticated training offerings, most with the mission of providing complete\nend-to-end training solutions for global enterprise companies.\n\nThese organizations invariably cover all of the major certification programs\n(such as Microsoft, CompTIA, Cisco, VMware and Oracle) and a great many top-\ntier, high-demand credentials as well (including CISSP, PMP and CEH).\n\nWhat differentiates these companies is how well they adopt and implement\nonline training options and how quickly they deliver new training materials to\nkeep up with new, changed or upgraded credential requirements. Our favorites\nin this group include Fast Lane, Firebrand, StormWind and Skillsoft. But\nGlobal Knowledge, Learning Tree and New Horizons aren't far behind.\n\nBelow are some of the best options for multifocus IT training.\n\n### Best IT training companies that cover most subjects\n\n**Company name**\n\n|\n\n**Training focus**\n\n|\n\n**Online training**\n\n|\n\n**Offline training**  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n[CBT Nuggets](http://www.cbtnuggets.com/)\n\n|\n\nMost major programs\n\n|\n\nOnline training library, vLabs, coaching\n\n|\n\nComputer-based video training, vLabs, practice exams, mobile  \n  \n[Computer Generated Solutions (CGS)](http://www.cgsinc.com/)\n\n|\n\nAll major programs\n\n|\n\nE-learning, blended learning, online mentoring, vLabs\n\n|\n\nILT, blended learning, mobile  \n  \n[Executrain](http://www.executrain.com/)\n\n|\n\nAll major programs\n\n|\n\nE-learning, vLabs, online mentoring, ILO\n\n|\n\nILT, self-paced courseware, custom materials  \n  \n[Fast Lane](http://www.flane.com/)\n\n|\n\nMost major programs\n\n|\n\nILO, vLabs, blended learning\n\n|\n\nILT, custom materials, digital courseware  \n  \n[Firebrand](http://www.firebrandtraining.co.uk/)\n\n|\n\nAll major programs\n\n|\n\nSupplementary e-learning\n\n|\n\nILT, bootcamps, courseware, e-books, practice labs and tests, apprenticeships  \n  \n[Global Knowledge](http://www.globalknowledge.com/)\n\n|\n\nAll major programs\n\n|\n\nILO, vLabs, blended learning\n\n|\n\nILT, blended learning, managed programs, student assessments, custom materials  \n  \n[Infopro Learning](https://www.infoprolearning.com/)\n\n|\n\nAll major programs\n\n|\n\nE-learning, vLabs, blended learning, mobile\n\n|\n\nILT, blended learning  \n  \n[Learning Tree](http://www.learningtree.com/)\n\n|\n\nAll major programs\n\n|\n\nILO, vLabs, blended learning, coaching, bootcamps\n\n|\n\nILT, blended learning, onsite training, custom materials  \n  \n[LearnQuest](http://www.learnquest.com/)\n\n|\n\nAll major programs\n\n|\n\nE-learning, blended learning, vLabs, ILO, custom group training, bootcamps,\nonline (project) mentoring\n\n|\n\nILT, blended learning  \n  \n[Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/IT-training-tutorials/2057-0.html)\n\n|\n\nMost major programs\n\n|\n\nE-learning, blended learning, vLabs\n\n|\n\nBlended learning, mobile, custom materials  \n  \n[New Age Technologies](https://www.newat.com/)\n\n|\n\nAll major programs\n\n|\n\nE-learning, blended learning, vLabs, ILO\n\n|\n\nILT  \n  \n[New Horizons](http://www.newhorizons.com/)\n\n|\n\nAll major programs\n\n|\n\nILO, e-learning, vLabs, blended learning, online mentoring\n\n|\n\nILT, blended learning, onsite training  \n  \n[ONLC](https://www.onlc.com/)\n\n|\n\nMost major programs\n\n|\n\nRemote ILT\n\n|\n\nILT  \n  \n[Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/)\n\n|\n\nMost major programs\n\n|\n\nE-learning\n\n|\n\nOnline and offline viewing  \n  \n[Skillsoft](http://www.skillsoft.com/)\n\n|\n\nAll major programs\n\n|\n\nILO, e-learning, e-books, vLabs, online mentoring\n\n|\n\nCourseware, e-books, vLabs, mobile  \n  \n[StormWind](https://www.stormwindstudios.com/)\n\n|\n\nMost major programs\n\n|\n\nInstructor-led e-learning\n\n|\n\nNone  \n  \n* * *\n\n## Vendor-specific IT training companies\n\nThe big dogs in the high-technology provider sector that invest heavily in\ncertification programs, professional development and training delivery include\nCisco, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle.\n\nWhereas Cisco follows a partner-centric model for training delivery (the\ncompany creates training materials and the curriculum but relies on learning\npartners for delivery), the other three companies mix their own course\ndeveloper and instructor-led offerings with partnerships to extend their\ngeographic coverage and reach.\n\nAlthough these companies have moved into online certification training\noptions, they still resort to traditional testing centers (such as Pearson VUE\nand Prometric) to deliver their certification exams. However, Microsoft also\noffers [online proctored exams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-\nus/learning/online-proctored-exams.aspx) through Pearson VUE in many global\nlocations, including most of North America and Europe and much of Asia for\nmany of its MCP exams.\n\nOf these programs, Microsoft and IBM have some of the most interesting and\ninnovative technology, while Cisco is regarded as having some of the best\ntraining curriculum, materials and related study guides around (from Pearson-\nowned Cisco Press).\n\nThe major IT companies listed in the table below offer a variety of education\nand certification programs.\n\n### Best vendor-specific IT training options\n\n**Company name**\n\n|\n\n**Training focus**\n\n|\n\n**Online training**\n\n|\n\n**Offline training**  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n[Cisco\nLearning](http://tools.cisco.com/GlobalLearningLocator/LLocatorHome.do)/[Cisco\nLearning Network](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/welcome)\n\n|\n\nSelf-study options and Cisco Training Partners\n\n|\n\nPractice exams, videos, vLabs, learning materials, study groups, study\nquestions\n\n|\n\nPractice exams, books, vLabs, courseware  \n  \n[Citrix Training](http://training.citrix.com/)\n\n|\n\nOffline training focuses on partners\n\n|\n\nLive virtual and self-paced training\n\n|\n\nILT (partner training centers), custom training  \n  \n[Dell Education Services](http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/04/by-service-type-\ntraining-services)\n\n|\n\nDell plus Microsoft, VMware and Citrix\n\n|\n\nE-learning, online training libraries, ILO, vLabs\n\n|\n\nILT (at Dell or onsite)  \n  \n[HPE Education Services](http://www8.hp.com/us/en/training/certification.html)\n\n|\n\nHP infrastructure, networking, storage; ITIL, ITSM, Linux, Microsoft,\nOpenStack, project management, virtualization and more\n\n|\n\nILO, e-learning, video learning\n\n|\n\nILT, custom courses  \n  \n[IBM Authorized Training](https://www.ibm.com/services/learning/ites.wss/us-\nen?pageType=page&c=a0000048)\n\n|\n\nHuge portfolio of IBM platforms and technologies\n\n|\n\nILO, e-learning, online training libraries, vLabs, virtual classrooms\n\n|\n\nILT (partner training centers), self-paced materials  \n  \n[Microsoft Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/default.aspx)\n\n|\n\nHuge portfolio of Microsoft platforms and technologies\n\n|\n\nE-learning, blended learning, vLabs, e-books, on-demand\n\n|\n\nILT, self-paced materials, books  \n  \n[Oracle University](http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-\ndad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=3)\n\n|\n\nOracle, MySQL, Java, Siebel, Linux, Solaris, PeopleSoft\n\n|\n\nILO, e-learning, on-demand\n\n|\n\nILT, self-paced materials, custom courses  \n  \n[Red Hat](http://www.redhat.com/en/services/training)\n\n|\n\nRed Hat, Linux, JBoss, OpenStack and more\n\n|\n\nILO, e-learning, vLabs, videos, video conferencing, webinars\n\n|\n\nILT, onsite, printed materials, practice tests  \n  \n[VMware Education](http://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrreg/index.cfm)\n\n|\n\nVMware, ITIL, AirWatch, NSX, virtualization and mobility\n\n|\n\nILT, e-learning, vLabs, course library, video training subscription, webinars,\nwebcasts\n\n|\n\nILT, labs, onsite, books  \n  \n## Information security and computer forensics training\n\nInformation security deals with managing security through policies,\ntechnologies, and best practices for systems and users alike. Due to the\npersistent information security threats that every IT organization must guard\nagainst, security awareness training and related certifications are a huge and\ngrowing marketplace. High-value certifications, such as the Certified\nInformation Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Certified Information\nSecurity Manager (CISM), Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), and other security\ncredentials all occupy important niches in this arena.\n\nThe table below includes certification sponsors such as EC-Council, ISACA,\n(ISC)2 and the SANS Institute as well as outright, general or special-purpose\ninfosec certification training companies, including InfoSec Institute,\nSecureNinja and Security University.\n\n### Best information security training companies\n\n**Company name**\n\n|\n\n**Training focus**\n\n|\n\n**Online training**\n\n|\n\n**Offline training**  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n[EC-Council](https://www.eccouncil.org/get-certified-with-ec-council/)\n\n|\n\nEC-Council certifications\n\n|\n\nE-learning, blended learning, ILO, vLabs, assessment tests, live online\nbootcamps\n\n|\n\nILT, official courseware, computer-based videos, assessment tests, books,\ne-books, vLabs, onsite training, mobile  \n  \n[Infosec Institute](http://infosecinstitute.com/)\n\n|\n\nAll major infosec certifications\n\n|\n\nILO, e-learning, vLabs, online mentoring, video\n\n|\n\nILT, labs, practice test review  \n  \n[ISACA](http://www.isaca.org/)\n\n|\n\nISACA partners\n\n|\n\nILO, e-learning, webinars, virtual conferences, vLabs\n\n|\n\nILT, official courseware, books, self-paced video training, onsite training,\nexam review courses  \n  \n[(ISC)2](https://www.isc2.org)\n\n|\n\n(ISC)2 partners\n\n|\n\nILO, e-learning, vLabs, self-assessments\n\n|\n\nOfficial ILT, textbooks, courseware, onsite training  \n  \n[SANS Institute](http://www.sans.org/)\n\n|\n\nSANS GIAC certifications\n\n|\n\nILO (live), e-learning, self-paced, vLabs, e-library, webcasts\n\n|\n\nILT, custom training, mentoring, printed materials  \n  \n[SecureNinja](http://secureninja.com/)\n\n|\n\nMost major programs\n\n|\n\nILO, e-learning, mentoring, vLabs\n\n|\n\nILT, blended learning, custom training, onsite training, textbooks, practice\nexams  \n  \n[Security University](http://www.securityuniversity.net/)\n\n|\n\nSU security certs, CISSP, CompTIA, ISACA\n\n|\n\nNone\n\n|\n\nILT, labs, videos, practice tests, books  \n  \nEmerging as a high-value, high-interest niche for IT certification, computer\nforensics deals with the acquisition, analysis and maintenance of a legally\ndefensible chain of evidence having to do with computer use, abuse or attack.\n\nThe table below reflects a blend of computer forensic vendors with\ncertification programs that have forensics certification training, such as\nAccessData and ARC Group, along with consulting companies, such as Digital\nIntelligence and ISFCE (CCE BootCamp).\n\nThis is one area where certifications come and go with alarming frequency; do\nyour homework to ensure your chosen credential has some history, market\nrecognition and a sizable certified population (3,000 or more is good; 10,000\nor more is better) before plunking down any training dollars.\n\n### Best computer forensics training companies\n\n**Company name**\n\n|\n\n**Training focus**\n\n|\n\n**Online training**\n\n|\n\n**Offline training**  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \n[AccessData](http://accessdata.com/training)\n\n|\n\nAccessData platforms and products (via Syntricate)\n\n|\n\nILO, e-learning, vLabs, videos\n\n|\n\nILT, labs, custom training, printed materials  \n  \n[Digital Intelligence](https://digitalintelligence.com/)\n\n|\n\nDFF, DFFEN, EnCase 8, FTK, Cellebrite, JTAG, NUIX, DFFAD\n\n|\n\nNone\n\n|\n\nILT, labs, custom training  \n  \n[ISFCE CCE Bootcamp](http://www.cce-bootcamp.com/)\n\n|\n\nCertified Computer Examiner (CCE)\n\n|\n\nE-learning, vLabs, manuals, software\n\n|\n\nILT, self-study, vLabs, practice exams, onsite, software  \n  \n## Other IT training companies\n\nThe organizations in the table below are certification players that offer\nhigh-value or high-impact certification training across a range of IT\nplatforms, technologies and skill sets.\n\nLPI and Red Hat offer important credentials for IT professionals who work with\nLinux platforms.

Maybe you should invest in yourself, to encourage others to\ninvest in you, too. Taking advanced training classes and building your IT\ncertification portfolio are two great ways to stand out from the rest of the\nIT crowd.\n\nIn this list of the dozen best IT training and certification resources, we\nlooked at the market leaders. The companies included here offer technical and\ncertification training that will help you separate yourself from the herd,\nwhile accelerating your career path into a better job, with better pay.\n\nMost IT training companies offer instructor-led training (ILT) as well as\nonline computer-based training (CBT) options. Look for companies that provide\nthe specific courses and certification training you need to develop new or\ndeeper skills and knowledge in your chosen IT niche. If you\u2019re looking to move\ninto a different IT specialty, training classes and certifications make a\ngreat first step toward developing different skill sets that may open new\ndoors.\n\n## Oracle University: Back to School\n\nThe Oracle universe has expanded exponentially over the last decade to include\na plethora of enterprise software and hardware solutions. [Oracle\nUniversity](https://education.oracle.com) is the place to go for hundreds of\nOracle-specific courses and dozens of certifications. This includes a slew of\nOracle application software packages, Oracle database and data warehousing,\nJava programming, virtualization technology, ERP and supply chain management\nsolutions, and much, much more.\n\nOf course, Oracle University offers to teach you any way you choose to be\ntaught: instructor-led classroom courses, on-demand courses, virtual classes\nor self-paced online training. Additionally, Oracle University offers more\nthan 200 certifications within the Oracle ecosystem, including its database\nplatforms, programming tools and languages, and all its major applications and\nplatforms.\n\n## Microsoft Learning: An 800-lb Training Gorilla\n\nWho knows better than Microsoft how to train and certify IT professionals on\nthat company's technologies?

Many IT pros\nstart by taking a course or two through the[ Microsoft Virtual\nAcademy](https://mva.microsoft.com/) (MVA), which offers hundreds of courses\nthat are free of charge and delivered by technology experts.\n\nConsidering the size of the Microsoft training market and high demand for\nMicrosoft-focused training, IT pros have many options for learning Microsoft\ntechnologies and getting certified. Get started by perusing the Microsoft\nLearning website, or go directly to your favorite training and certification\ncompany. Nearly all major training companies cover Microsoft topics as part of\ntheir curriculum.\n\nTo ensure that you are getting the latest information required to master a\nsubject or attain a certification, look for the Microsoft Certified Learning\nPartner logo. In particular, all-you-can-learn plans are a good way to acquire\nongoing training. Find offerings like this from training companies such as\nPluralsight, CBT Nuggets or QuickCert, where you get access to their entire\ntraining catalogs (stuffed with Microsoft and other topics) for a low monthly\nfee.\n\n## Project Management Institute: Projects\u2019R\u2019Us\n\nIT is all about problem-solving to support business goals and requirements for\nan organization. Those of us with experience in IT have discovered over time\nthat projects without planning, structure and management almost certainly fail\nat some point during the project cycle. There are just too many variables,\ndependencies and gotchas in modern IT processes for companies to take a \"Wild\nWest\" approach to mission-critical IT projects and implementations.\n\nThe Project Management Professional (PMP) certification from the Project\nManagement Institute ([PMI](https://www.pmi.org)) is a well-established\nprofessional credential that demonstrates mastery of project management\nprinciples, practices and procedures. While the PMP is usually a prerequisite\nfor project manager and program manager roles, there is significant value for\nother IT professionals who also earn the PMP credential. The PMP has been, is\ntoday and will remain something of a gold standard for project management\ncertification.\n\nIf your organization plans, develops and delivers large-scale IT projects that\nserve critical business needs, you'll find value in learning how projects\nshould be managed to ensure that they're successful. PMI also offers\ncertifications for those charged with the task of managing programs and\nportfolios, as well as certifications in risk, scheduling and business\nanalysis. Also look for academic PMI partners who offer PMI-sanctioned\nofficial curriculum courses in colleges and universities around the country.\n\n## The Cisco Learning Network: All Things Cisco\n\nThe Cisco Learning Network is THE one-stop shop for Cisco-related training and\ncertification preparation.

The InfoSec Institute also offers an\nintriguing boot camp and training topic labeled 8570.1, which speaks to\ncertification requirements for those who work in and around information\nsecurity for the U.S. government, U.S. Department of Defense or related\ncontracting companies.\n\n## IBM Skills Gateway: Watson, Come Here!\n\nSince 2017, IBM Authorized Training has rebranded itself as the[ IBM Skills\nGateway](https://www-03.ibm.com/services/learning/).

These specially curated collections of learning\ncontent are designed to help you acquire skills in a specific area like cloud\ncomputing, security and mobile administration or development.

Global Industry Analyst, I study all aspects of HR, business leadership,\ncorporate L&D, recruiting, and HR technology.\n\n  * Like854\n  * Comment59\n  * Share\n    * LinkedIn\n    * Facebook\n    * Twitter\n\n0\n\nA shoe just dropped in the talent management marketplace. Workday introduced\nWorkday Learning, the company's new solution for learning management (LMS),\ncareer development, video content sharing, and video management. (Workday\nLearning is scheduled to be generally available in second half of 2016, with\nearly availability starting this year.)\n\nThis is a significant announcement for several reasons, and I wanted to share\nsome perspectives on the learning platform market and the potential impact of\nWorkday's market entry.\n\n**The Learning Management Systems (LMS) Market: Big And Growing**\n\nToday the LMS market is over $2.6 billion in size _(Bersin by Deloitte LMS\n2015 research)_ and growing rapidly (more than 20% growth rate in 2014) as\nmany companies replace their older training systems.  The corporate LMS is\ntypically used to administer and manage the complex business of corporate\neducation, which includes class scheduling, e-learning and virtual training,\ncompliance and regulatory tracking, career and professional development, sale\nof education products to customers and partners, as well as internal video\nsharing, expertise networks, and some knowledge management.\n\nBecause training is so complex and varies widely from company to company,\nthere are many vendors. Some focus on compliance and global training; some\nfocus on video and content management; others focus on professional\ndevelopment and knowledge sharing. Our research identified than 300 vendors in\nthe market, with a few dominant players (CornerstoneOnDemand, SumTotal, SAP,\nOracle, and Saba) each with slightly over 10% market share. _(Source:  Bersin\nby Deloitte LMS 2015 research, available to Bersin members.)_\n\nThese systems have become mission-critical to most large companies. In\nindustries like financial services, health care, pharmaceuticals, and energy,\nthe LMS manages mandatory compliance training. In large global companies the\nLMS manages career development programs, onboarding programs, leadership\ndevelopment programs, and functional training programs (IT, project\nmanagement, quality, etc.). And as a place to store content, the LMS is a vast\nrepository for videos, webcasts, documents, course materials, assessments,\ne-learning, and tests.\n\nWhile the LMS market started out 20 years ago as a standalone software\ncategory, today most companies want their LMS integrated into their other\ntalent management applications. So all the major LMS companies built out\ntalent management suites to address this need.\n\n**The LMS Market Shift:  From Learning Management To Learning **\n\nThe LMS market has changed rapidly over the last few decades. As the following\nchart shows, the market evolved in four stages, following the evolution of\nlearning and HR technology. In the 1980s the systems focused on classroom\nmanagement: in the 1990s and early 2000s they shifted toward e-learning and\nonline learning; over the last decade they've focused on integrated talent\nmanagement and talent development; and today they are becoming digital\nlearning platform: the _consumer-like TV channel  of corporate learning_.\n\n![](//:0)\n\n\n\nEach of these shifts has been driven by a change in technology, leading to new\napproaches to learning.\n\n  * In the 1970s and 1980s we primarily learned in the classroom and through PC-based videos. The LMS was used for training administration and classroom scheduling.\n  * In the  1990s we shifted to internet-based courseware, which was largely consisted of page-turning courses. Standards like AICC let us track progress through courseware so the LMS became an e-learning management system.\n  * In the early 2000s the concepts of integrated talent management became popular, so vendors focused on integrating their LMS systems with talent applications.\n  * And today, driven by mobile smartphones, bandwidth, social networking, and cameras everywhere, we learn through video, content sharing, MOOCs, and recommendations from others. The modern learning world is filled with expert-authored videos, expert blogs and articles, tweets, webcasts, and an ever-expanding marketplace of external (and internal) content.  The LMS must become a true \"learning system.\"\n\nThe way we learn and interact with content has also changed. While people take\nlonger courses for deep technical training, much of our learning is in 1-2\nminute chunks. Vendors like BigThink, Grovo, Khan Academy and many more offer\nvideo learning in almost every area of business - including technical\ndevelopment, management skills, and programs for health and wellness. And this\ngrowth is likely to continue:  investors have poured more than $2.5 billion\n(Source CB Insights) into technology-based education companies in the first\nhalf of 2015 alone.\n\nDriven by this shift, today's learning platforms must help people _find\nlearning content quickly_ (videos, documents, or short courses), make it easy\nto _publish and recommend content_ , and _integrate video and content  _right\ninto our daily lives. The LMS should operate like a consumer TV channel (ie.\nApple iTunes, YouTube or Netflix): wherever I am I should be able to find\ncontent I need, play it on my phone, and find other content that's related.\n\nAnd now that it's so easy to author video, companies want the system to help\nmanage content authored by employees, providing content management, digital\ncontent distribution, and one click publishing.\n\nCan today's LMS systems do this?  Often, not very well.\n\nLearning management systems are complex beasts. They have to manage thousands\nof courses, they are highly customized, and they must integrate into the\ncorporate infrastructure.\n\nWhen you ask companies about their systems, they often say they are hard to\nuse, complicated, and filled with old or rarely-used content. Since the core\nparadigm has been the course catalog, employees often don't enjoy using them\n(they have to search or scroll through thousands of duplicative courses to\nfind what they need), and there are often too many steps (or clicks) to find,\nenroll, and consume content.\n\nI just received research conducted by Degreed and CLO Magazine (209 companies\nresponded) which shows that 46% of L&D professionals don't even log into their\ncorporate learning system more than once per year and only 20% of employees\nuse the LMS for any non-compliance learning at all. _(Source:  Degreed and CLO\nMagazine, October 2014)_\n\nAn entire industry of learning experience middleware has developed (companies\nlike Degreed, Pathgather, Xyleme, Fuse, Wisetail and others) to help make\nthese systems work better.\n\n![](//:0)\n\n\n\n**Workday's Strategy:  An Integrated Learning Experience Optimized For Video**\n\nWorkday has had time to study this market, and is launching a product designed\nto address many of these issues. The product is intended to offer an easy-to-\nuse, integrated learning experience that can deploy video and online content\nat the point of need, integrated into the flow of work. The system uses\nWorkday's analytics technology, recommendations, and feedback tools to\nrecommend content and lets training managers arrange content into campaigns.\nIt runs on mobile devices, includes video content management (technology just\nacquired), and offers robust, enterprise-class learning management at its\ncore.\n\n_**Video  Is Now Everywhere**_\n\nWhy the focus on video? Well the use of video in learning has been explosive.\nAnalysts believe that 51% of all mobile internet traffic is now video  (Cisco\nresearch believes over 80% by 2018 / source Cisco website) and platforms like\nYouTube and Facebook now have billions of users (source:  YouTube Statisics\nsite) watching videos each year. If you have children who use Snapchat or\nVine, you know that video is rapidly replacing photos as the most \"fun\" way to\nshare information, and video is getting more prevalent and easier to author\nevery day (nearly every device we buy now has a camera).\n\n![](//:0)\n\n_(courtesy of Workday, October 2015)_\n\n Other LMS vendors did see this coming:\n\n  * SuccessFactors (SAP) acquired a video learning company in 2011 (Jambok) and offers a social learning platform called Jam which integrates video learning into its enterprise class LMS.\n  * Skillsoft (SumTotal), which sells video learning on many topics, built an new learning experience that curates and integrates its video into a personalized recommendation system.  They are partnering with IBM to provide intelligent recommendations for development.\n  * Saba has reinvented its user interface in the last several years and gives recommendations and suggestions to learning, even giving employees points for certain social activities.\n  * CornerstoneOnDemand just announced a partnership with Ted _(Source:  CornerstoneOnDemand website)_.\n  * and Oracle has previewed a new video learning platform which they plan to build out into an enterprise-class LMS.\n\nWorkday is making video-based learning _central and core_ to Workday Learning,\nand integrating the use of video throughout the Workday transaction platform.\nThe company hopes to build a compelling, recommendation-based experience that\nmakes corporate learning as fun and easy as TV a consumer website. Think\nNetflix for corporate learning - the system recommends content based on your\nusage. And the company is introducing a new idea to facilitate learning: \"the\nopportunity graph,\" a way of looking at what your mentors or highly successful\npeers have done, so you can mimic their career and learning experiences. This\nis something which appeals to all of us, bringing together social following\nwith big data analytics.\n\nWhile this is not a new idea, Workday's technology, integrated platform and\narchitecture, expertise in analytics and machine learning, and focus on the\nuser experience can create a new level of excitement for integrated video-\nbased learning.\n\n(The company acquired a dedicated video learning company _(MediaCore)_  to\njump start their technology platform and video expertise.)\n\n**How Workday Learning Impacts The Market**\n\nThis product introduction will impact the market in several important ways.\n\nFirst, Workday's focus on shared video makes \"video learning\" a _central\nfeature_ in the LMS market. While SuccessFactors Jam, Oracle's Video Learning\nplatform, and smaller vendors like Fuse, Grovo, and Wisetail offer video\nsolutions, this announcement further legitimizes the role of video in\ncorporate learning, encouraging buyers to look at the  _learning experience_\nas a critical feature in their LMS buying decision.\n\nSecond, this announcement starts to end Workday's partnerships with\n_CornerstoneOnDemand_ and _Saba_. Over the years Workday customers who wanted\na new integrated LMS have typically purchased one of these products and taken\nadvantage of a productized integration between the platforms. While many\ncustomers will continue to integrate these products while Workday's product\ncomes to market, over the long term these partnerships will likely go away.\n\nThird, this announcement brings Workday into the video content business. While\nSkillSoft (SumTotal) continues to be a large online content provider, and new\nvendors like BigThink, Grovo, and MOOCs like edX and Corpu will continue to\ngrow, Workday's \"video-centric\" platform will encourage content providers to\nshift to Workday's platform for integration and publishing, creating a\npowerful content ecosystem.\n\nWhy wouldn't a content provider focus on one of the fastest-growing platform\nproviders for their marketplace?  When corporate buyers start authoring\ncontent for the Workday platform, why wouldn't Workday offer a content sharing\nsystem that lets customers share content with each other?  There are many new\ndimensions available to Workday here.\n\nWill Workday Learning become an overnight success?  Time will tell - this is a\ncomplex market and the company has many features to build. But remember that\nWorkday customers want a single, end-to-end solution with a unified experience\nand modern cloud architecture - and this is what Workday plans to deliver.\n\nThe team at Workday has experience in this space and their vision is clear.\nLet's hope Workday helps advance the market and raise the bar for corporate\nlearning for vendors, HR departments, and employees around the world.\n\n\\----\n\n_About the Author: Josh Bersin is the founder and Principal of Bersin by\nDeloitte, Deloitte Consulting LLP, a leading research and advisory firm\nfocused on corporate leadership, talent, learning, and the intersection\nbetween work and life.

This area isn't for everyone, though: you've\nnot only got to know your stuff cold and be willing to work long and hard\nhours to keep up with whatever certification programs you decide to cover.\nYou've also got to be outgoing, a good speaker, well-organized, good with\npeople and fast on your feet.\n\nBut with thousands of independent training centers in North America alone and\njobs for the cream of the crop with certification sponsors themselves, there\nare lots of opportunities for people who possess these characteristics. In\nfact, certification sponsors usually have their own training departments, and\nthey often develop their own curriculum and exams for certifications they\nsponsor, so training jobs can lead to follow-on roles with curriculum and\ncourse development, exam development and certification program work, as well\nas classroom, video or on-camera training roles.\n\nMost vendors have specific requirements for people who want to teach their\ncertification courses. At a minimum, would-be instructors must take the course\nand pass the exam for the topic they wish to teach, often with a higher score\nthan those who wish to earn an associated certification. In many cases,\ninstructors must also present or acquire \"train the trainer\" or \"trainer\ntraining\" credentials as well.\n\n\"Train the trainer\" often refers to a specific course that's designed to teach\ninstructors how to deliver specific courses, and to prep students for related\nexams. \"Trainer training\" credentials essentially seek to demonstrate or\nvalidate someone's classroom training skills, to ensure they meet standards\nfor classroom content delivery, time, people management and so forth.\n\nThe certifications covered in this article fall under the heading of \"trainer\ntraining\" or \"training certification,\" in the sense that these credentials\nseek to identify individuals who are capable of instructing IT certification\ncandidates in a classroom situation (either in an actual classroom, or in a\nvirtual classroom using web-based online conferencing or course delivery\nenvironments). In the 1980s and 1990s, as IT certification programs really\nstarted ramping up, most certification sponsors had their own customized\ntrain-the-trainer certifications (and some still do, as you'll see).\n\nSalaries for IT trainers vary but are consistent across different\ncertification sectors. Per SimplyHired, most IT trainers can expect to earn an\naverage of $66,202. Of course, some senior IT trainer positions have the\npotential to earn much more, with top earnings reported upward of $104,791.\nContract or freelance training professionals with name recognition and perhaps\ntheir own followings can expect to earn $1,000 a day and up for time spent\nteaching in the classroom or in a video studio.\n\nBefore moving on, look at our unofficial job board search for the top five\ncertifications covered in this article to get an idea of which certifications\nare popular with employers.\n\n## Job Board Search Results (in alphabetical order by certification)\n\n**Certification**\n\n|\n\n**[SimplyHired](http://www.simplyhired.com/)**\n\n|\n\n**[Indeed](http://www.indeed.com/)**\n\n|\n\n**[LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/linkedin-jobs)**\n\n|\n\n**[Linkup.com](http://www.linkup.com/)**\n\n|\n\n**Totals**  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n**ACT (Apple)**\n\n|\n\n21\n\n|\n\n39\n\n|\n\n2\n\n|\n\n63\n\n|\n\n**135**  \n  \n**CCSI (Cisco)**\n\n|\n\n132\n\n|\n\n170\n\n|\n\n27\n\n|\n\n149\n\n|\n\n**478**  \n  \n**CST (Scrum Alliance)**\n\n|\n\n74\n\n|\n\n92\n\n|\n\n139\n\n|\n\n116\n\n|\n\n**421**  \n  \n**CTT+ (CompTIA)**\n\n|\n\n69\n\n|\n\n72\n\n|\n\n15\n\n|\n\n28\n\n|\n\n**184**  \n  \n**MCT (Microsoft)**\n\n|\n\n30\n\n|\n\n37\n\n|\n\n33\n\n|\n\n9\n\n|\n\n**109**  \n  \n## ACT: Apple Certified Trainer\n\nWith the ongoing popularity of all things Apple, especially in corporations\nand enterprises worldwide, there's always been strong interest and\nparticipation in Apple's sizable and active certification program.\n\nAn Apple Certified Trainer, or ACT, is a person who delivers official Apple\ncurriculum elements, both inside the company and at Apple Authorized training\noutlets. ACT credentials are available as follows:\n\n  * **Apple Creative Pro Applications** : Final Cut Pro X Professional Post-Production, Logic Pro X Professional Music Production\n  * **Apple Technical** : iOS and macOS\n  * **iOS Deployment** : iOS and iOS in Education\n  * **iOS Development** : Swift Programming and iOS SDK\n  * **Service Fundamentals** : ACMT and ACiT\n  * **iOS Security:** iOS Security and Privacy\n  * **iOS Network:** iOS Network Integration\n\nAs is typical for trainer credentials, the ACT seeks to identify individuals\nwho can ensure proper quality, consistency and accessibility when delivering\nApple training courseware and materials around the world. Upon attaining the\nACT credential, ACTs are well prepared and able to deliver courses in either\nApple Authorized Training Centers and/or the commercial realm.\n\nGiven that Apple classes include elements that involve lectures,\ndemonstrations, hands-on exercises and courseware furnished by Apple or third-\nparty subject matter experts, the courses are dynamic and quite interesting to\nteach as well as attend. General knowledge in Apple platforms and tools, both\nwithin and beyond individual course targets, is strongly recommended for all\nwould-be ACTs, so they can serve their students well in and out of the\nclassroom.\n\nACTs get a nice batch of perks with their certification, including special\nsupport access, instructor-only communications (including peer discussions,\njob listings, technical resources and more), and tuition and publication\ndiscounts.\n\n### ACT Facts and Figures\n\n**Certification Name**\n\n|\n\nApple Certified Trainer (ACT)  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n**Prerequisites & Required Courses**\n\n|\n\nHighly recommended:\n\nMinimum one-year training students in a structured classroom (group) setting\n\nDeep understanding of training methods and classroom management techniques\n\nExcellent presentation skills\n\nExperienced with Apple technologies and applications\n\nFor creative track only, at least three years' experience as an editor, sound\ndesigner, DVD author, photographer, or visual-effects artist (experience as\nteacher may be considered to fulfil the requirement)\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nMaster the chosen Apple technology, such as macOS\n\nAchieve end-user certification for the relevant product\n\nSubmit a LearnQuest Instructor application\n\nDemonstrate skills at a Train-the-Trainer (T3) event\n\nPass the T3 exam for chosen technology (if available)\n\nRe-certification: Certification is valid for the life of the course  \n  \n**Number of Exams**\n\n|\n\nTwo exams; the end-user certification exam for the chosen technology and the\nT3 exam  \n  \n**Cost per Exam**\n\n|\n\n$200 per Apple end-user certification exam  \nT3 events include workshops and multi-day classroom sessions; prices vary\ndepending on course, complexity, region, and duration; for example, a two-day\nworkshop may cost $1,050 whereas a five-day course may cost $3,000\n\nFor courses that have trainer exams, exam cost is included in T3 costs\n\nFor the courses that have product-level exams, exams are $250; candidates are\nhighly encouraged to attend product-level courses but are not strictly\nrequired  \n  \n**URL**\n\n|\n\nACT training and certification information currently available through\nLearnQuest:  \nhttp://www.learnquest.com/search-\nresults.aspx?categoryid=709&subcategoryid=4580  \n  \n**Self-Study Materials**\n\n|\n\nNone available, as far as we can tell  \n  \n## CCSI: Certified Cisco Systems Instructor\n\nCisco offers training through its own training centers (mostly for training\nits own huge in-house staff) and through its network of Cisco Learning\nPartners (CLPs). Unless you work for Cisco (in which case you'll have access\nto internal resources about which we could learn very little in our research),\nyou'll have to pursue Certified Cisco Systems Instructor (CCSI) certification\nthrough a CLP. The CLPs provide training, set fees and their own instructional\nrequirements, and provide details about examinations and necessary\ndemonstrations of teaching skills involved.\n\nEarning and holding a CCSI is a lot like obtaining and maintaining an H-1B\nVisa for non-citizens who wish to work in the USA: it means developing and\nmaintaining a good relationship with some CLP who will act as your sponsor,\nand who will work with you and Cisco to help you earn and maintain this\ncertification. If you want to teach Cisco courses, this will be a necessary\nrelationship to build and hold.\n\n### CCSI Facts and Figures\n\n**Certification Name**\n\n|\n\nCertified Cisco Systems Instructor (CCSI)  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n**Prerequisites & Required Courses**\n\n|\n\nRequired:\n\nBe a current employee of a Cisco Learning Partner (CLP) or be sponsored by a\nCLP\n\nSelect a baseline technology, take the course(s) and pass associated exam(s)\n(with an instructor-level score)\n\nPass the Instructor Certification Program (ICP) evaluation (a two-day event\nthat evaluates presentation skills and hands-on skills)\n\nAcknowledge the Cisco Certified Systems Instructor Agreement\n\nPurchase a CCSI membership\n\nRecertification required if credential holders are inactive for one year or\nafter major updates are made to Cisco authorized courses  \n  \n**Number of Exams**\n\n|\n\nTwo or three exams depending on chosen baseline technology  \n  \nICP evaluation spans at least two days, which includes a hands-on lab exam  \n  \n**Cost per Exam**\n\n|\n\nCisco exams cost $300 each  \n  \nICP evaluation costs vary by partner; many sponsors permit successful\ncandidates to work off the evaluation fees by teaching instead of requiring\ncash payment.  \n  \n**URL**\n\n|\n\n[https://ciscocert.secure.force.com/english/articles/Article/Certified-Cisco-\nSystems-Instructor-CCSI-\nEN?retURL=/english/apex/SearchResults?searchkeyword=CCSI&popup=false](https://ciscocert.secure.force.com/english/articles/Article/Certified-\nCisco-Systems-Instructor-CCSI-\nEN?retURL=/english/apex/SearchResults?searchkeyword=CCSI&popup=false)  \n  \n**Self-Study Materials**\n\n|\n\nSponsors generally offer student and instructor manuals for ICP coverage. Many\nsources for books, Exam Crams, practice exams and so forth are available for\nCisco certifications. Cisco offers an [Instructor Certification Program\nKit](https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/instructor-kits/certification-\nprogram-icp-kit-membership-ik-icp-mem-1-0) membership to prospective\ncandidates for a nominal fee of $25. Membership is valid for four months while\ncandidates prepare for the exam.  \n  \n## CST: Certified Scrum Trainer\n\nScrum Alliance, Inc. is a membership organization that promotes the adoption\nof Scrum methodology and provides both education and a networking community to\nScrum and Agile practitioners. The Alliance offers certifications for\nScrumMaster, Scrum Product Owner, Scrum Developer, Scrum Coach (Team Coach,\nEnterprise Coach, and Trainer), and Agile Leadership.\n\nThe Certified Scrum Trainer (CST) joined our list of the top five IT trainer\ncertifications in 2018. The CST is an \"elevated\" or \"guide\" level cert and\nreserved for persons who are licensed to teach Scrum Alliance ScrumMaster and\nProduct Owner courses.\n\nTo become a CST, candidates must go through a lengthy application process to\nprove their qualifications. As a foundation, they must have thorough knowledge\nof Scrum practices plus hands-on experience implementing Scrum as a\nScrumMaster, product owner or team member. That means they must hold the\nCertified Scrum Professional (CSP) certification from Scrum Alliance or the\nCertified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) certification if they want to teach CSPO\ncourses. They must also prove they have taught Scrum in at least 10 multi-day\nScrumMaster training sessions to at least 100 students total.\n\nAfter a Trainer Approval Community (TAC) reviews and approves a CST\napplication, a candidate is interviewed by a panel at a global Scrum\ngathering, a regional Scrum gathering or a Scrum Alliance-sponsored event.\nApproved CSTs must sign an agreement and pay an annual fee.\n\nThe CST certification is valid for one year. CSTs are expected to keep their\nskills current by attending trainer and coach retreats, conducting training\nevents, joining discussion groups and the like.\n\n[Scrum Certification Prep + Scrum Master + Agile Scrum\nTraining](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=UGpKqH26sAU&offerid=507388.362632&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fscrum-\ncertification%2F)\n\n### CST Facts and Figures\n\n**Certification Name**\n\n|\n\nCertified Scrum Trainer (CST)  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n**Prerequisites & Required Courses**\n\n|\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nDeep knowledge of Scrum concepts, practices and principles\n\nAn active Certified Scrum Professional ScrumMaster\u2122 ([CSP-\nSM](https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified/practitioners/csp-\ncertification)) or Certified Scrum Professional Product Owner ([CSP-\nPO](https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified/practitioners/csp-\ncertification)) certification\n\nAn active Certified Scrum Product Owner\n([CSPO](https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified/practitioners/cspo-\ncertification)) designation for those who wish to teach CSPO courses\n\nHands-on experience implementing Scrum as a ScrumMaster, product owner or team\nmember\n\nExperience teaching Scrum to at least 100 students during at least 10 multi-\nday ScrumMaster training sessions\n\nRecertification: Annual recertification required  \n  \n**Number of Exams**\n\n|\n\nNone  \n  \n**Cost per Exam**\n\n|\n\n$250 application fee and an annual fee as specified in the CST Agreement\n\nCandidates can expect to pay $3,199 to $3,499 for CSP-SM and CSP-PO training\ncourses.

The CTT+ is accepted as\nevidence of trainer training in many IT certification programs outside\nCompTIA, including Adobe, Dell, Microsoft, IBM, Ricoh and Cisco. CTT+\ncertified professionals are also highly sought after and employed by the U.S.\nDepartment of State.\n\nToday, earning a CTT+ requires passing two exams: a CTT+ Essentials exam,\nwhich covers basic instructional concepts and techniques, and either a\nClassroom Trainer (real-life instructor-led training) or a Virtual Classroom\nTrainer (online training, usually video-based) exam. These latter items\nrequire submission of a recording of the candidate teaching in the environment\nto which the specific exam applies (in the classroom for Classroom Trainer;\nonline or via video-based instruction for Virtual Classroom Trainer) and\ncompletion of a detailed questionnaire about the content, focus and coverage\nof the materials for the recorded teaching encounter submitted for review.\nCandidates must also pass the computer-based CTT+ Essentials exam before they\ncan submit the forms for the Trainer exam.\n\nIf you want to teach certification courses, the CTT+ is an excellent choice\nfor helping to warrant your skills and abilities in the classroom.\n\n[Certified Technical Trainer Practice\nTest](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=UGpKqH26sAU&offerid=507388.1387834&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcomptia-\nctt-test%2F)\n\n### CTT+ Certification Facts and Figures\n\n**Certification Name**\n\n|\n\nCompTIA Certified Technical Trainer (CTT+)  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n**Prerequisites & Required Courses**\n\n|\n\nRecommended: six to 12 months of training experience\n\nRequired: Video or recording of candidate's classroom or virtual classroom\nsessions for TK0-202 or TK0-203 exam  \n  \n**Number of Exams**\n\n|\n\nTwo exams:\n\nCompTIA CTT+ Essentials, TK0-201 (95 questions, 90 minutes, passing score of\n655 required) PLUS\n\nCompTIA CTT+ Classroom Performance Based Exam, TK0-202* OR\n\nCompTIA CTT+ Virtual Classroom Performance Based Exam, TK0-203*\n\n*Submission of instructional recording required (must be 17 to 22 minutes in length); passing score of 36 (on a scale of 48) required  \n  \n**Cost per Exam**\n\n|\n\nCompTIA CTT+ Essentials, TK0-201: $319  \n  \nCompTIA CTT+, TK0-202 and CompTIA CTT+, TK0-203: $339 each  \nTotal: $658 for two exams  \n  \n**URL**\n\n|\n\n<https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/ctt>  \n  \n**Self-Study Materials**\n\n|\n\nThe [CompTIA IT training site](https://certification.comptia.org/training)\noffers several self-study materials including exam objectives and sample\nquestions, as well as classroom and e-learning training opportunities.

It remains a\ntraditional path for would-be Microsoft trainers when obtaining official\nstatus as a certified instructor for Microsoft technical and certification\nclasses.\n\nThe MCT comes with some sweet benefits to match its annual fee and\nrecertification requirements.

Also, the Certified Professional in Learning & Performance\nCertification ([CPLP](https://www.td.org/Certification)) from the Association\nfor Talent Development (ATD) focuses on instructional design (ID), training\ndelivery, coaching, learning technologies and the like.\n\nGoogle for Education, aimed at K-12 schools, offers the [Certified\nTrainer](https://edutrainingcenter.withgoogle.com/certification_trainer)\ncertification to teachers, technologists and consultants who incorporate\ntechnology into the classroom.\n\nFor those interested in certification and training, it's hard to get closer to\nthe source than becoming a certified instructor, unless you go to work for the\nsponsor that designs and builds the content and exams that drive certification\ncredentialing efforts.\n\nTeaching others is a great way to stay on top of the learning curve for those\nwith the necessary drive and skills, and the pay isn't bad either. And there\nare plenty of outside jobs in sponsor training organizations and at various\ntraining companies. Many IT professionals make good living working as contract\ninstructors in their chosen subject fields. If you love teaching and IT, it's\na great area to be in.\n\n![](https://img.business.com/w/80/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2ltYWdlcy9hdXRob3IvNWM3L2IyM2Q2N2I0Mzc0MjMyMzhiNDVhMC80MDAtNDAw)\n\nBusiness News Daily Editor\n\n    \n\nBusiness News Daily was founded in 2010 as a resource for small business\nowners at all stages of their entrepreneurial journey.

There will also be strong demand for technical\nskills like programming and app development, along with skills that computers\ncan\u2019t easily master such as creative thinking, problem-solving and\nnegotiating.\n\n[![](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/anX6J-9yZ9XogJwy_Lm-0fTfPL_yuPSIoBpp0MNHkXI.png)](https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-\nfuture-of-jobs-report-2018)\n\nImage: World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2018\n\nA short-term solution to filling these skills gaps would be for companies to\npay a premium to acquire talent with skills in demand. But even if they can\nfind people with the right skills and are happy to bear the cost, it will not\nhelp in a few years time when those new skills are no longer needed.\n\nThe point is that as new roles emerge and skills requirements change, the size\nof the existing pool of skilled workers just isn\u2019t going to be big enough to\nmeet demand. Today, for example, there is a massive shortage of people skilled\nin data science and AI. Companies won\u2019t simply be able to fall back on hiring\nnew employees as they attempt to future-proof their workforce.\n\nSo, what options do business leaders have now as they prepare for such a\nrapidly changing future?\n\n##  Sizing up the problem\n\nTo address the problem, companies must invest more in enabling their workforce\nto reskill - starting now. Timing is critical. The [World Economic\nForum](https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-jobs-report-2018)\nestimates that [more than half](https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-\njobs-report-2018) (54%) of all employees will require significant reskilling\nby 2022, but the problem is likely to be even more acute in some regions.\n[European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-\nmarket/en/news/digital-opportunities-europe-digital-skills-and-jobs-coalition-\nconference) figures show that around 37% of workers in Europe don\u2019t have even\nbasic digital skills, not to mention the more advanced and specialised skills\ncompanies need to successfully adopt digital technologies.\n\nWhat is required is a holistic solution that prioritises new approaches to\nskills development within an existing workforce and in previously untapped\ntalent pools. Such an approach would also help address the shared\nresponsibility (with governments and education providers) of ensuring that the\ntechnological advances of the Fourth Industrial Revolution don\u2019t increase\neconomic inequality as lower-skilled workers find themselves out of a job.\n\n**Step up plans for workforce building**  \nAlthough [two-thirds of U.S. hiring\nmanagers](https://www.salesforce.com/form/conf/workforce-research/) believe\nthat implementing workforce development programmes will help them prepare for\nfuture disruptions or innovations, many businesses have been slow to do so.\nThey are held back by budgetary constraints, lack of employee time to\nparticipate in training, and lack of appropriate training technology.\n\nThis inertia is hard to fathom, given the looming skills gap and the urgent\nneed to develop a proactive response. As the skills gap widens, businesses\nthat don\u2019t take steps now to tackle the problem will be left behind. Business\nleaders need to look critically at the technical and \u2018human\u2019 skills needed to\nfuture-proof their workforce, and move quickly to free up the resources needed\nto take the first steps towards building a culture of lifelong learning among\ntheir employees.\n\n##  Harness technology to enable lifelong learning\n\nCompanies can develop their own courseware for reskilling and upskilling\nemployees. Several [online learning\nplatforms](https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/345257/the-best-online-learning-\nplatforms-for-business) such as Coursera, Udacity and Udemy have promised to\nhelp businesses stay ahead of digital disruption by offering courses in areas\nincluding data science, machine learning and AI. Salesforce has developed its\nown free, gamified online learning platform,\n[Trailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/home), which allows users to\ntake control of their own training and develop the skills they\u2019ll need in the\nfuture.\n\nThe companies that are successful in workforce transformation will be able to\n\u201charness new and emerging technologies to reach higher levels of efficiency of\nproduction and consumption, expand into new markets, and compete on new\nproducts for a global consumer base composed increasingly of digital natives\u201d,\naccording to the [World Economic Forum](http://reports.weforum.org/future-of-\njobs-2018/key-findings/).\n\n##  Swim outside your usual talent pools\n\nBusinesses must also develop new approaches to workforce development for those\noutside of traditional talent pools. By hiring people from diverse\nbackgrounds, including young people, minority groups and those without a\ncollege education, businesses can tap into a huge pool of high-potential and\nunderutilised talent.\n\nStudies have confirmed the benefits of workforce diversity, which drives both\ninnovation and results. According to a [McKinsey\nreport](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-\ninsights/delivering-through-diversity), companies in the top quartile for\ngender or racial and ethnic diversity are more likely to have financial\nreturns above their national industry medians.\n\nIn addition to adopting more inclusive hiring practices, businesses also need\nto think about how they provide training. Apprenticeships offering practical\non-the-job training, in-house training programmes for non-college educated\nentry-level employees, and partnerships with external workforce development\nagencies, all play an important role when building a more diverse workforce.\n\nEffective existing skills development programmes, like the Siemens\nFoundation\u2019s [Middle-Skill Initiative](http://www.siemens-\nfoundation.org/programs/stem-middle-skill-initiative/), work with young adults\nto close the \u2018opportunity gap\u2019 and build careers in the fields of science,\ntechnology, engineering and maths (STEM). Another organisation, [Year\nUp](https://www.yearup.org/), provides training, support and meaningful work\nexperience to nearly 4,000 young adults annually, with the aim of helping them\nfulfill their potential in higher education or kick-start a career.\n\nSalesforce\u2019s own [Pathfinder](https://pathfinder.salesforce.com/s/) training\nprogram, developed jointly with Deloitte, aims to equip workers with the\ntechnical and business skills needed for careers in the Salesforce ecosystem.\n\n###  Have you read?\n\n  * [ The digital transformation is a skills and education opportunity for all. Companies must use it ](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/digital-transformation-is-an-opportunity-to-re-skill-everyone-companies-must-use-it)\n  * [ These are the 10 most in-demand skills of 2019, according to LinkedIn ](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/01/the-hard-and-soft-skills-to-futureproof-your-career-according-to-linkedin)\n\n**Be employee-friendly**\n\nFinally, businesses must aim to become an \u2018employer of choice\u2019 in order to\nboost their chances of attracting and retaining talent.\n\nIn a competitive jobs market, securing top talent isn\u2019t only about offering an\nattractive salary package and other perks. Millennial employees in particular\nwant to work for an organisation of which they can feel proud. Those with\nhigh-value skills will increasingly vote with their feet if a business doesn\u2019t\nalign with their values.\n\n[Salesforce research](https://www.salesforce.com/contents/impact-of-equality/)\nshows that companies that lead with their values, create social impact and\nwork towards building a more diverse and inclusive culture are better\npositioned to boost employee engagement and productivity, and win the war for\ntalent. Best-practice recruitment and providing opportunities for ongoing\npersonal development and community service also go a long way towards\nattracting and retaining top talent.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to enable businesses to\nfuture-proof their workforces. However, by making upskilling, reskilling and\nemployee retention priorities and freeing up the resources needed to build a\ncontinuous learning culture, businesses will be well positioned to thrive in\nthe Fourth Industrial Revolution.\n\nShare\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fagenda%2F2019%2F03%2Fthe-\ndigital-skills-gap-is-widening-fast-heres-how-to-bridge-it%2F)\n[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=wef&text=The%20digital%20skills%20gap%20is%20widening%20fast.%20Here%E2%80%99s%20how%20to%20bridge%20it&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fagenda%2F2019%2F03%2Fthe-\ndigital-skills-gap-is-widening-fast-heres-how-to-bridge-it%2F)\n[](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=WEF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fagenda%2F2019%2F03%2Fthe-\ndigital-skills-gap-is-widening-fast-heres-how-to-bridge-it%2F)\n[](https://share.flipboard.com/bookmarklet/popout?v=2&title=The%20digital%20skills%20gap%20is%20widening%20fast.%20Here%E2%80%99s%20how%20to%20bridge%20it&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fagenda%2F2019%2F03%2Fthe-\ndigital-skills-gap-is-widening-fast-heres-how-to-bridge-it%2F)\n[](whatsapp://send?text=The%20digital%20skills%20gap%20is%20widening%20fast.%20Here%E2%80%99s%20how%20to%20bridge%20it+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weforum.org%2Fagenda%2F2019%2F03%2Fthe-\ndigital-skills-gap-is-widening-fast-heres-how-to-bridge-it%2F)\n\nLicense

Chief Financial\nOfficer Coram Williams also announced his departure on Thursday less than a\nmonth after [Chief Executive John Fallon revealed his\nplans](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pearson-ceo-to-retire-and-company-\nwill-sell-remaining-penguin-random-house-stake-2019-12-18?mod=article_inline)\nto leave the company. Williams will be replaced by deputy CFO Sally Johnson.\n\nThe educational publisher said operating profit for 2019 would be \u00a3590 million\n($771 million), at the bottom end of its guidance range. It said adjusted\noperating profit for 2020 would be between \u00a3500 million and \u00a3580 million,\nwhich includes the sale of its [remaining 25% stake in Penguin Random\nHouse](https://www.barrons.com/articles/pearson-sells-penguin-random-house-\nstake-as-ceo-john-fallon-plans-exit-51576685130?mod=article_inline) to German\nmedia giant Bertelsmann.\n\n[](https://www.barrons.com/articles/pearson-sells-penguin-random-house-stake-\nas-ceo-john-fallon-plans-exit-51576685130?mod=article_inline)The weaker\nperformance last year was driven by falling revenue from its U.S. higher\neducation courseware unit, which accounts for 24% of the company\u2019s total\nrevenue.\n\nStudents and educational institutions have been shifting away from expensive\nacademic textbooks in favor of digital resources in recent years, [hurting\nPearson\u2019s performance](https://www.barrons.com/articles/pearson-plunges-as-u-\ns-students-shun-textbooks-for-online-resources-at-rapid-\npace-51569493176?mod=article_inline).\n\nThe education giant, attempting to catch up, has been pushing toward a\ndigital-first strategy, as well as cutting jobs to make savings.\n\nPearson said its digital to print revenue split was now 63% to 37%, compared\nwith 55% to 45% the previous year, but it warned the pain would continue in\n2020.\n\n\u201c[We] expect trends seen in 2019 in U.S. higher education courseware to\ncontinue with heavy declines in print partially offset by modest growth in\ndigital as more products are added to the global learning platform,\u201d the\ncompany said in a statement.\n\nOutgoing Chief Executive John Fallon said the \u201cmuch weaker sales\u201d in its\nhigher education unit\u2014a 12% drop\u2014were offset by a strong performance in the\nother 76% of the company.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe future of learning will be increasingly digital and consumer\ndefined. Experience, outcomes and affordability will all matter and while\nthere is still much to do we are well placed to benefit from these trends to\nachieve future, sustainable growth.\u201d\n\n**Looking ahead.** Pearson\u2019s digital shift has been painful and now looks set\nto weigh on the company\u2019s profits in 2020 too. The sale of its remaining stake\nin Penguin Random House is intended to allow the company to fully focus on the\ndigital strategy, but actually it leaves Pearson more exposed to the education\nmarket.\n\nOn top of that, the company will have to deal with key management changes this\nyear. It is going to be a while yet before things start getting better.\n\n* * *\n\nClose\n\n![](https://asset.barrons.com/public/resources/images/ON-\nDK551_Pearso_D_20200116085437.jpg)\n\n### Pearson Tumbles as Falling U.S. University Sales Will Hit 2020 Profits\n\nPearson\u2019s stock plunged to 11-year lows on Thursday, as the publisher said\nprofits would fall in 2020 while U.\n\nFrom\n\nTo\n\nMessage\n\nSEND\n\nAn error has occurred, please try again later.\n\nThank you\n\nThis article has been sent to\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/barrons?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[](https://twitter.com/barronsonline/?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[](http://www.linkedin.com/company/41970?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[](https://www.instagram.com/Barrons/?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[Privacy Notice](https://dowjones.com/privacy-notice/?mod=BOL)\n\n[Cookie Notice](https://dowjones.com/cookie-notice/?mod=BOL)\n\n[Copyright Policy](https://www.barrons.com/about/copyright-\npolicy?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[Data Policy](https://www.barrons.com/about/data-policy?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\n[Your Ad Choices](https://dowjones.com/cookie-notice/?mod=hp_FOOTER#cookies-\nadvertising)\n\n[Subscriber Agreement & Terms of\nUse](https://www.barrons.com/about/subscriber-agreement?mod=hp_FOOTER)\n\nCopyright \u00a92020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The components\ninclude resources, people, training and education, development practices,\nexperiential learning, and learner motivation.\n\n## 1\\. Resources\n\nResources comprise such assets as performance support tools, job aids,\npodcasts, video chats, procedure manuals, and online databases. Resources are\nhelpful for conveying explicit knowledge or providing just-in-time learning.\nAccording to Lombardozzi, \u201cthe trick is finding resources that are at the\nright level, high quality, and relevant to a particular context.\u201d\n\n## 2\\. People\n\nPeer support systems, coaching, social media connections, and communities of\npractice form the people component. The depth of these interactions can vary a\ngreat deal, from a close, daily relationship in the workplace to following\nexperts on Twitter, Lombardozzi explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## 3\\. Training and Education\n\nThese components include on-the-job training, courseware and seminars,\ncertification or licensing programs, and follow-up exercises to the education\nevent. Training can be in person, self-study, online, or a combination.\n\u201cResearch has shown that retention and application depend on relevance, deep\nengagement, practice, and feedback,\u201d writes Lombardozzi.\n\n## 4\\. Development Practices\n\nStretch-assignment management, after-action review practices, supervisor\nsupport and feedback, and career coaching are facets of development practices.\nManagers and the organization as a whole play a critical role in developing a\nculture where development practices are supported and encouraged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## 5\\. Experiential Learning\n\nCollaborating, creating personal notes and job aids, engaging in critical\nreflection, and learning by doing fall under this component. A trainer can\npromote and nurture these types of activities, \u201cmost especially by making\nself-assessment and reflection tools available to learners,\u201d says Lombardozzi.\n\n## 6\\. Learner Motivation\n\nLearner motivation can be described as self-direction, confidence in the\nability to learn, and a belief in the link between learning and performance.\n\u201cLearners need to choose to learn, so without some degree of motivation,\nlittle learning can occur,\u201d stresses Lombardozzi.\n\nWhile several of these factors are tangible and within your control as a\ntrainer, it is important to remember that many of them are not. Success also\ndepends on the learners and their relationships with others, such as coaches\nor team members.\n\nSource: _Adapted from Lombardozzi, C._ 2015\\.

Apple certifications fall into one of\ntwo categories: credentials geared to IT professionals and credentials geared\nto creative professionals. There's also an Apple Certified Trainer (ACT)\ncredential for those interested in teaching the Apple certification curriculum\nto others, in both creative and IT knowledge domains.\n\nApple certifications in the IT professional bucket focus on macOS\ncertifications, the AppleCare Mac Technician (ACMT) certification and the\nApple Certified iOS Technician (ACiT) certification. Training options are\navailable for Apple certifications that include traditional in-person,\ninstructor-led classes; online, self-paced interactive training; and online,\ninstructor-led classes, offered by multiple Apple Authorized Training Centers\nworldwide.\n\n## macOS certifications\n\nA macOS certification recognizes an individual's ability to manage and support\nmacOS in stand-alone systems and networked computers in an organization. As is\nApple's tradition, operating system certifications are available for the two\nmost current editions of the operating system, which are currently macOS\nSierra and macOS High Sierra.\n\n**macOS Sierra certifications**\n\n|\n\n  * Apple Certified Support Professional (ACSP) 10.13\n  * Apple Certified Associate \u2013 Mac Integration Basics 10.13\n\n  \n---|---  \n  \n**macOS High Sierra certifications**\n\n|\n\n  * Apple Certified Support Professional (ACSP) 10.13\n  * Apple Certified Associate \u2013 Mac Integration Basics 10.13\n\n  \n  \nThe ACSP is all about installing, configuring and troubleshooting macOS. The\nApple Certified Associate \u2013 Mac Integration Basics certification focuses on\ntasks related to networking. This certification covers connecting to directory\nservices; creating network accounts; setting up file sharing and printing;\nconfiguring email, contacts, and calendar access; configuring security; and\nmanaging networked data.\n\nApple operating system certifications have no prerequisites. Exams for the\nACSP are available only through an Apple Authorized Training Center, but\ncandidates can sign up for all other exams through [Pearson\nVUE](http://www.pearsonvue.com/apple/), an Apple Authorized Training Center or\nonline. Online test-taking is limited to certain exams, such as the Apple\nCertified Associate \u2013 Mac Integration Basics 10.13. Users who are new to the\nMac ecosystem can learn the basics from a variety of online training resources\navailable at the [Apple Support\nTraining](https://support.apple.com/explore/new-to-mac) website.\n\n[Learn more about Apple macOS Support Essentials from\nUdemy](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=UGpKqH26sAU&offerid=507388.2179312&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fapple-\nmacos-support-essentials%2F)\n\n## AppleCare service certifications\n\nThe AppleCare Certified Mac Technician (ACMT) credential focuses on\ntroubleshooting and repair of Macintosh desktop and laptop computers and\ndisplays, as well as troubleshooting Mac operating system issues.\n\nThe Apple Certified iOS Technician ([ACiT](https://support.apple.com/en-\nus/HT205332)) certification recognizes required skills for servicing iOS-based\ndevices, such as iPhones and iPads. Both certifications require two exams\n(available through [Pearson VUE](http://www.pearsonvue.com/apple/)), and\nneither certification expires.\n\n**ACMt exams**\n\n|\n\n  * Apple Service Fundamentals Exam ([SVC-17A](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207707))\n  * ACMT 2017 Mac Service Certification Exam ([MAC-17A](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207709))\n\n  \n---|---  \n  \n**ACiT exams**\n\n|\n\n  * Apple Service Fundamentals Exam ([SVC-17A](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207707))\n  * ACiT 2017 iOS Service Certification Exam ([iOS-17A](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207708))\n\n  \n  \nThe concept of \"performing repairs\" on Apple products may be confusing. The\ncompany points out that achieving the ACMT certification verifies that you\nhave the skills to repair Apple products, but certification alone doesn't mean\nyou're _authorized_ to make such repairs. For that, you'll need to become an\nApple Authorized Service Provider, which establishes a business relationship\nwith Apple. However, Apple has a [self-servicing\nprogram](https://support.apple.com/self-servicing-account-program) in which\nparticipants, such as schools, are allowed to service and repair Apple\nproducts they own at their own sites.\n\nOur _[Best Computer Hardware\nCertifications](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10759-hardware-\ncertifications.html)_ article features the ACMT as one of the top five\nhardware-related certifications, and provides a more detailed look at this\ncertification and its requirements.\n\n[Learn more about Apple Service Fundamentals from\nUdemy](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=UGpKqH26sAU&offerid=507388.2276167&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fapple-\nservice-fundamentals%2F)\n\n[Learn more about Apple Mac Certified Service Certifications from\nUdemy](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=UGpKqH26sAU&offerid=507388.2180388&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fapple-\nmac-certified-service-certification-exam%2F)\n\n## Apple creative professional certifications\n\nOn the creative side, there are two types of certifications available: one for\nProductivity Ap, and another for Pro Applications. Both Productivity App and\nPro Applications certifications are designed to appeal to graphic artists and\nmultimedia professionals.\n\nAn Apple Certified Professional (ACP) Productivity App designation recognizes\nan individual's skills in using specific Apple applications. Currently, three\nApple Productivity App certifications are offered for the iWork software\nproductivity suite:\n\n  * Apple iWork \u2013 Pages: Document creation and editing\n  * Apple iWork \u2013 Keynote: Presentation creation and editing\n  * Apple iWork \u2013 Numbers: Spreadsheet creation and editing\n\nApple Certified Pro Applications certifications focus on Final Cut Pro X and\nLogic Pro X. Final Cut Pro X is post-production video-editing software, and\nLogic Pro X is a full-featured sound editor. Two Apple Certified Pro\nApplications certifications are available:\n\n  * Final Cut Pro X (10.4 exam)\n  * Logic Pro X (10.4 exam)\n\nAlthough Productivity and Pro Applications certifications don't have specific\nprerequisites, Apple recommends \"knowledge of OS X and basic computer\nnavigation\" across the board before taking associated training courses.\n\nAs with MacOS certs, users who are new to the Mac ecosystem can learn the\nbasics from a variety of online training resources available at the [Apple\nSupport Training](https://support.apple.com/explore/new-to-mac) website.\n\n[Learn more about Mastering Apple iWork Keynote from\nUdemy](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=UGpKqH26sAU&offerid=507388.40375&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fkeynote09%2F)\n\n[Learn more about Final Cut Pro X from\nUdemy](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=UGpKqH26sAU&offerid=507388.301316&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Flearning-\nfinal-cut-pro-x-video-editing-mastery%2F)\n\n## Apple Certified Trainer and related careers\n\nIf you're an Apple creative product master, or have great skills and passion\nfor supporting Macs or macOS, the Apple Certified Trainer (ACT) credential can\nbe your gateway to career opportunities in teaching Apple technology.\n\nAn ACT teaches Apple certification courses in corporate settings and in Apple\nAuthorized Training Centers, helping the next generation of candidates earn\ntheir certifications. To become an ACT, you need to be certified in the\nknowledge area(s) you want to teach, possess a combination of teaching and\nreal-world experience, and pass a Train-the-Trainer (T3) exam on the subject\nmatter. [LearnQuest](https://www.learnquest.com/search-\nresults.aspx?categoryid=709&subcategoryid=4580) administers the ACT program on\nbehalf of Apple.\n\nThe Apple Certified Support Professional, or ACSP, is geared toward help desk\npersonnel and service technicians. The Apple Certified Associate \u2013 Mac\nIntegration Basics certification is useful for network professionals who need\nto know how to add a Mac to a network (a Windows-based network or others) and\nmanage services for users.\n\nAn ACMT or ACiT diagnoses hardware or device problems, makes repairs and\nperforms upgrades. Both certifications are ideal for service technicians\nseeking jobs that require such certifications, such as those employed by an\nApple Authorized Service Provider (AASP), a Self-Servicing Account (SSA), or\nan Apple reseller. If you plan to spend several years in an organization\nthat's mainly a Mac shop, an Apple certification can help you negotiate a\nhigher salary or land a position with more responsibilities.\n\nApple creative certifications are geared toward videographers, multimedia\ndesigners, editors, artists, photographers and the like \u2013 folks who use Apple\nproductivity and professional applications on a daily basis.\n\nThe certifications also frequently appear in job postings as pre-requisites\nfor digital A/V specialists and library associates who oversee implementation\nof and/or use of the tools. Creative managers who lead creative strategy for\ncorporate marketing teams but must also design and develop creative assets are\nexcellent candidates for the Apple creative certifications.\n\n## Apple training and certification resources\n\nTo get started, visit the Apple [Training and\nCertification](https://training.apple.com/) website. There, you'll find links\nto books and e-books, video training, classroom training, and more. Apple\nprovides free exam preparation guides for most certification exams. These\nguides let you understand the type of exam that's required, the total number\nof questions and time allotted, and the exam objectives so you know which\ntopics will be covered. Prep guides also list recommended resources \u2013 books,\ncourses, etc. \u2013 that best prepare you to take Apple certification exams.\n\nClasses on Apple products are offered through Apple Authorized Training\nCenters, which are usually two- to five-day courses with live instructors who\nlead students through lectures and hands-on labs and answer questions along\nthe way. Candidates for the ACMT or ACiT certifications can take AppleCare\nTechnician Training, which is self-paced.\n\nAASPs and SSAs offer the same self-paced training for employees seeking ACMT\ncertification through ATLAS, which is offered through the Global Service\nExchange (GSX). Apple certification candidates can also attend online\ninstructor-led training classes offered by various Apple Authorized Training\nCenters.\n\nApple's creative certification candidates interested in self-study options can\nsubscribe to [O'Reilly Online](https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/)\nLearning, an on-demand digital library that includes lots of e-books and video\ntraining, including the Apple Pro Training Series. Candidates for Final Cut\nPro certification should also browse the web tutorials, user guides and\nwhitepapers on the [Final Cut Pro Resources](http://www.apple.com/final-cut-\npro/resources/) page.\n\nAlthough official certifications aren't involved, Apple also offers training\nresources for [Swift 4](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) as well as [iOS 12\nSDK](https://developer.apple.com/ios/) for developers.\n\n![](https://img.business.com/w/80/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2ltYWdlcy9hdXRob3IvNWM3L2IyM2Q2N2I0Mzc0MjMyMzhiNDVhMC80MDAtNDAw)\n\nBusiness News Daily Editor\n\n    \n\nBusiness News Daily was founded in 2010 as a resource for small business\nowners at all stages of their entrepreneurial journey.

BC keeps systems running and data available despite\ninterruptions or faults. DR brings systems back to normal operation after a\ndisaster has occurred.\n\nBusiness continuity planning (BCP) and disaster recovery planning (DRP) remain\nimportant elements in IT governance and compliance. This is especially true\nfor corporations and organizations that must meet various mandates regarding\nprivacy, confidentiality, and availability of systems and data. With\nincreasing proliferation and use of cloud-based backup services \u2013 including a\nbroad range of BC and DR offerings \u2013 BCP and DRP have become more tractable\nand sometimes even less costly over the past five years.\n\nThis probably explains why we're in something of a heyday for BCP and DRP\ncertifications, as that IT niche explodes with investment and activity. Given\nthat costs and complexities of designing, implementing, and maintaining\ntechnology platforms for BCP and DRP have gotten somewhat simpler and less\nburdensome, many more organizations are venturing into this area of IT.\n\nWe performed an informal online job board survey to identify the number of job\npostings for which employers require relevant certifications. This snapshot in\ntime gives you an idea of what employers are looking for in the real-world job\nmarket and indicates ample opportunities for those interested in business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery.\n\nOur top five certifications are the CBCP from DRI International, the CBCI from\nBCI (a U.K.-based organization), the C/DRE from Mile2, the CBCM from Certified\nInformation Security and the EDRP from EC-Council. To pick those leaders, we\nlooked at the state of BC and DR certification, examined various market and\nsalary surveys, and performed an informal job board survey that reveals the\nnumber of job posts across the U.S. in which our featured certifications were\nmentioned on a given day.\n\n## Job board search results (in alphabetical order, by certification)\n\n|\n\n**Certification**\n\n|\n\n**[SimplyHired](http://www.simplyhired.com/) **\n\n|\n\n**[Indeed](http://www.indeed.com/) **\n\n|\n\n**[LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) **\n\n|\n\n**[LinkUp](http://linkup.com) **\n\n|\n\n**Total**  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n**CBCI**\n\n|\n\n73\n\n|\n\n96\n\n|\n\n37\n\n|\n\n42\n\n|\n\n248  \n  \n**CBCP**\n\n|\n\n182\n\n|\n\n287\n\n|\n\n375\n\n|\n\n185\n\n|\n\n1029  \n  \n**EDRP**\n\n|\n\n88\n\n|\n\n115\n\n|\n\n940\n\n|\n\n313\n\n|\n\n1456  \n  \n**Note** : The ISO 22301 Certified Business Continuity Manager (CBCM) and the\nCertified Disaster Recovery Engineer (C/DRE) certifications are also featured\nin this article. They are absent from this table because unrelated\ncertifications use the same initials and/or the certification name is generic.\nSearching for \"Certified Business Continuity Manager\" resulted in almost 700\nhits, and a search for \"Certified Disaster Recovery Engineer\" resulted in\nabout 500 hits. Many of those results don't apply to the CBCM or C/DRE\ncertification.\n\nAccording to SimplyHired, disaster recovery managers earn an average of almost\n$76,000 annually. On the low end, reported salaries averaged about $45,000\nannually, while top earners came in just over $127,000.\n\n## CBCI: Business Continuity Institute's Certification of the BCI\n\nIt's hard not to see the Business Continuity Institute (BCI) as a competitor\nto DRI, and it's plain that these two organizations share some friendly\nrivalry. Where DRI is headquartered in New York and active in more than 50\ncountries across North America, Latin America, Asia, Australia, the Middle\nEast and North Africa, BCI is based in the U.K. and most active in Europe,\nAsia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nBCI supports more than 9,100 members in 125 countries around the world, and it\nworks with more than 3,000 organizations in public and private sectors, plus\nthe so-called third sector \u2013 that part of an economy or society that's\ncomposed of nongovernmental and nonprofit organizations or associations, such\nas charities, volunteer and community groups, cooperatives, and NGOs. Founded\nin 1994, BCI is younger than DRI.\n\nThe primary certification from BCI is the Certificate of the Business\nContinuity Institute, also known as CBCI. A single exam is required, which is\ndelivered at the end of the recommended training course. Training is available\nin person or online, and exams that are not administered as a part of a\nclassroom course may be taken online. Candidates should review the [exam\nregistration page](https://www.thebci.org/training-qualifications/cbci-\nexam.html) for complete technical details before attempting the exam.\n\nBCI offers follow-on levels of membership in the organization at associate\n(AMBCI, Associate Member of BCI), member (MBCI, full Member of BCI), Associate\nFellow (AFBCI) and Fellow (FBCI) levels. Application and renewal fees vary by\ngeography depending on whether or not a member is located in a country with\nhigh, upper middle, lower middle or low income. Interested candidates should\ncheck the BCI [fee\ntable](https://www.thebci.org/uploads/assets/uploaded/089e4877-098b-4ccb-8776fde5624b586f.pdf)\nfor current membership and renewal rates. The institute also sponsors a\n[Business Continuity Management (BCI)\nDiploma](https://www.thebci.org/training-qualifications/dbci-diploma.html), a\n30-week academic certificate program in business continuity based on the BCI's\ncodified body of knowledge, supported by general background and specialist\ncollege courses.\n\nFor those pursuing a BC certification outside North America, particularly in\nEurope or countries belonging to the British Commonwealth, the CBCI is a\ncompelling credential. Likewise, those who wish to focus on BC at the\nundergraduate level would be well advised to investigate the organization's\nBCI Diploma. Though somewhat expensive, the credential is well recognized and\nhighly regarded.\n\nThe CBCI credential is valid for three years. As long as a credential holder\nhas moved to a more advanced level of BCI membership, no exams are required.\nHowever, if a credential holder has not advanced to a higher membership level,\nthey must take the current CBCI exam to maintain that credential. In addition,\ncredential holders are required to pay an annual membership fee.\n\n### CBCI facts and figures\n\n|\n\n**Certification name**\n\n|\n\nCertification of the BCI (CBCI)  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n**Prerequisites and required courses**\n\n|\n\nRecommended training includes instructor-led classroom or instructor-led\nonline CBCI training.

Exam may be taken at end of\ncourse or scheduled for later time. Classroom courses may not be available in\nall geographies.\n\nCandidates may also complete the eight-hour [Introduction to Business\nContinuity](https://www.thebci.org/knowledge/introduction-to-business-\ncontinuity.html) course (\u00a31,050, approximately $1,360).  \n  \n**Number of exams**\n\n|\n\nOne exam (120 multiple-choice questions, two hours).

Based in\nOrange Park, Florida, the organization has been active since 1999. It offers\ncredentials based on ISO Standards 31000 (Risk Analysis), 27001 (Information\nSecurity) and 22301 (Business Continuity Management). This organization also\nteaches ISACA CISM, CISA and CRISC courses, as well as training courses for\n(ISC)2 CISSP and a variety of fraud control topics (auditing, forensics and\nfraud investigation).\n\nThe CBCM is Certified Information Security's expert-level BCM certification.\nCandidates must have five years of documented, relevant BC experience. It\ncovers all the competence requirements documented in ISO 22301, which go well\nbeyond the confines of IT subjects into such things as evacuation plans,\npublic warnings and communication, and recovery services and suppliers. It\nrequires a reasonably complete understanding of the entire discipline of BCM.\n\nThe CBCM is especially suitable for those IT professionals charged with\ndesigning or managing BCM efforts within a single organization, or who may\nwork as BCM consultants or trainers for multiple organizations. Individuals on\ntrack for upper IT management or C-level positions with IT oversight\nresponsibility are likely to find the CBCM a valuable credential to help them\nstay on track for such roles.\n\nTo maintain the credential, certification holders must pay an annual\nmaintenance fee (currently $80) and earn a minimum of 120 continuing\nprofessional education (CPE) credits during a three-year certification cycle.\nAt least 20 CPEs must be reported annually.\n\n### CBCM facts and figures\n\n|\n\n**Certification name**\n\n|\n\nISO 22301 Certified Business Continuity Manager (CBCM)  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n**Prerequisites and required courses**\n\n|\n\nCIS membership ($20 application fee plus $80 membership fee; annual membership\nrenewal of $80 required each January)\n\nCompletion of three training courses:\n\n  * CIS Policy Workshop: ISO 31000 Enterprise Risk Management ($399.95)\n  * CIS Policy Workshop: ISO 22301 Business Continuity Management ($299.95)\n  * Best Practices to Deploy, Exercise, and Certify BCM ($299.95)\n\nFive or more years of verifiable experience plus completion of three candidate\nendorsement forms  \n  \nAnnual renewal required  \n  \n**Number of exams**\n\n|\n\nThree: RM 101, BCMS 101 and BCMS 102 (all exams administered online)  \n  \n**Cost per exam**\n\n|\n\n$100 (total $300)  \n  \n**URL**\n\n|\n\n<https://www.certifiedinfosec.com/iso-22301-bcm-certification/cbcm>  \n  \n**Self-study materials**\n\n|\n\n[Practice exams](http://www.certifiedinfosec.com/iso-22301-bcm-\ncertification/training-and-costs) available for $75 each  \n  \n## CBCP: DRI International's Certified Business Continuity Professional\n\n[DRI International](https://www.drii.org/aboutus) describes itself as \"a\nglobal leader in BCM (business continuity management) education and\ncertification,\" and it offers credentials for BC and DR. The organization,\nfounded in 1988, seeks to promote a base of \"common knowledge\" (cert-speak for\nconcepts, terminology, best practices, processes and procedures for some body\nof work or expertise) for the continuity management profession. It also\ncertifies qualified individuals in BC and promotes those individuals'\ncredibility and professionalism. DRI offers certification tracks in BCM\n(including advanced topics), auditing, public sector, healthcare continuity\nand risk management.\n\nDRI has certified more than 15,000 professionals with representation in more\nthan 100 countries, more than half of which are taught in native languages. We\nchose the DRI Certified Business Continuity Professional\n([CBCP](https://drii.org/certification/cbcp)) credential as the \"poster child\"\nfor the organization, not only because it is the most popular and best\nrecognized of its various certifications ([13 in\nall](https://drii.org/certificationoverview)), but also because it is preceded\nby an associate-level credential\n([ABCP](https://www.drii.org/certification/abcp)), augmented by specialist\ncerts ([CFCP](https://www.drii.org/certification/cfcp) for various functional\ncontinuity disciplines, and [CBCV](https://www.drii.org/certification/cbcv)\nfor vendors) and followed by a master-level cert\n([MBCP](https://www.drii.org/certification/mbcp)).\n\nThe CBCP is an excellent credential for current or aspiring BC practitioners,\nbut because it includes a \"verifiable experience\" component, candidates must\nhave some reasonable facsimile of on-the-job BCP experience to qualify for\nthis credential.\n\nRecertification is required annually. Candidates must pay an annual\nmaintenance fee and earn a minimum of 80 continuing education activity points\n(CEAPs) every two years to maintain this credential. Candidates should check\nthe [certification page](https://www.drii.org/certification/maintaincert.php)\nfor details on eligible activities.\n\n### CBCP: Facts and figures\n\n|\n\n**Certification name**\n\n|\n\nCertified Business Continuity Professional (CBCP)  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n**Prerequisites and required courses**\n\n|\n\nRequired: Minimum two years of verifiable experience in at least five of the\nsubject areas of the Professional Practices for Business Continuity\nManagement.

According to its\n[Cyber Security Certification Roadmap](https://mile2.com/certifications.html),\nthe company offers credentials in areas such as virtualization, application\nand source code, auditing, healthcare, wireless security, forensics, incident\nhandling, pen-testing hacking, cloud security, and IS management leadership as\nwell as disaster recovery and cyber warfare. Credentials cater to a wide range\nof skill sets, from fundamental levels to more advanced and specialized\ncredentials.\n\nThe Certified Disaster Recovery Engineer (C/DRE) credential is Mile2's\npinnacle DR certification. The associated C/DRE training course is approved by\nthe National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies, and it has been\ncertified by the National Security Agency as meeting the CNSSI-4016: National\nInformation Assurance Training Standards for Risk Analysis Security. It also\nmaps to the NIST/Homeland Security NICCS Cybersecurity Workforce Framework and\nis on the approved FBI Cybersecurity Certification Requirement (Tier 1-3)\nlist.\n\nWith a focus on the defense establishment, especially for information or\ncybersecurity coverage, Mile2 is well positioned to offer training and\ncertification for individuals who work in the defense industry in particular,\nor for local, state, or federal government agencies or contracting companies\nin general. That said, the C/DRE is not on the list of [DoD Approved 8570\nBaseline Certifications](https://iase.disa.mil/iawip/Pages/iabaseline.aspx).\n\n### C/DRE facts and figures\n\n|\n\n**Certification name**\n\n|\n\nCertified Disaster Recovery Engineer (C/DRE)  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n**Prerequisites and required courses**\n\n|\n\nA minimum of one year of information systems or IS management experience is\nrequired.\n\nRecommended training: C/DRE course ($2,500)  \n  \n**Number of exams**\n\n|\n\nOne  \n  \n**Cost per exam**\n\n|\n\n$400 (100 multiple-choice questions, two hours to complete)  \n  \n**URL**\n\n|\n\n[mile2.com/disaster-recovery-business-continuity-\nplanning.html](http://mile2.com/disaster-recovery-business-continuity-\nplanning.html)  \n  \n**Self-study materials**\n\n|\n\nMile2 maintains a list of learning resources, including practice exam\nquestions, [study guides](https://mile2.com/mile2-online-estore/prep-\nguides.html) ($50), [courseware kits](https://mile2.com/mile2-online-\nestore/courseware-kits.html) ($500), online [training\nvideo](https://mile2.com/mile2-online-estore/training-videos.html)\nsubscriptions ($550 per annual subscription), e-books and prep guides at the\n[Mile2 Store](https://mile2.com/mile2-online-estore.html).  \n  \n[Prepare for the Mile2\u00ae Certified Disaster Recovery Engineer (CDRE) with this\ncourse](https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=UGpKqH26sAU&offerid=507388.1761852&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcdre-\ncertified-disaster-recovery-engineer%2F)\n\n## EDRP: EC-Council's Disaster Recovery Professional\n\nThe EC-Council Disaster Recovery Professional (EDRP) certification comes from\nan organization with deep and well-recognized roots in the information\nsecurity community. Home to such certifications as the Certified Ethical\nHacker (CEH), various forensic and penetration testing credentials, the EC-\nCouncil also offers certifications aimed at security managers and executives,\nsoftware developers, network architects, and disaster recovery professionals.\nThe EDRP is gaining traction with companies and organizations seeking to\nvalidate skills and knowledge for those who plan, organize, and oversee\ntesting of their disaster response, recovery support, and business resumption\npractices and procedures.\n\nThe EDRP is as much about identifying vulnerabilities and managing risks for\norganizations as it is about planning, designing, testing and, when necessary,\nimplementing responses to interruptions of access or service or responses to\ndisasters. Topics covered include preparing a disaster recovery plan,\nassessing risk factors, developing policy and procedure, understanding the\nrelationships and roles among various groups and individuals who implement\nsuch plans, and managing the recovery process.\n\nAlthough we mention the EDRP last on our list, that doesn't mean it ranks last\nin perceived value or name recognition. If anything, the EDRP is probably the\nbest-known of the bunch. It is entirely worth pursuing for IT professionals\nresponsible for or involved in any organization's DR or BC planning, testing\nand implementation.\n\n### EDRP facts and figures\n\n**Certification name**\n\n|\n\nEC-Council Disaster Recovery Professional (EDRP)  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n**Prerequisites and required courses**\n\n|\n\nComplete Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity courseware ($650).  \n  \nPersons under the age of 18 must have parental consent and supporting letter\nfrom a nationally accredited institution of higher learning to take the course\nor sit for the exam.  \n  \n**Number of exams**\n\n|\n\nOne: No. 312-76  \n  \n**Cost per exam**\n\n|\n\n$350 (50 questions, two hours, 70 percent required to pass).

The Certified\nBusiness Resilience Manager (CBRM) and Certified Business Resilience IT\nProfessional (CBRITP) are most pertinent to this article. Like many other\nprograms covered here, these certifications are elements in a broader\ncertification program that also includes the BRCCI Certified Business\nResilience Auditor (CBRA) and the Master's Achievement in Business Resilience\n(MABR) credentials.\n\nFor certification candidates in Southeast Asia (mainly Singapore, Indonesia\nand Malaysia), the Business Continuity Management ([BCM](https://www.bcm-\ninstitute.org/)) Institute offers several BCP/DRP certifications, such as the\nBusiness Continuity Certified Specialist (BCCS), the Disaster Recovery\nCertified Specialist (DRCS) and several others through the expert level.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\n  * [ ![Best Digital Forensics

institutions_\n\n![](https://assetsds.cdnedge.bluemix.net/sites/default/files/styles/very_big_1/public/feature/images/online_course.jpg?itok=29Oe6mc1)\n\n[Nahaly Nafisa Khan](/author/nahaly-nafisa-khan)\n\nThanks to the internet, self-learning and training has been made easier in the\nlast few years for a wide group of people. Today, there are online courses for\nalmost anything and everything that you want to learn. The courses from ivy-\nleague schools and other reputed institutions like MIT, Stanford, etc. have\nbeen made available online for people like us sitting a thousand miles away.\nThere are intensive courses on computer science, engineering, programming\nlanguages, machine learning, digital marketing and any sort of technological\nskill development needed for the vastly changing demands in the job market.\n\nAccording to Raghib Noor, a third-year undergraduate student of Dhaka\nUniversity, online courses offer you an amazing experience through which you\nget to explore different regions of interests you never knew you had the\nchance to. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s a very humbling experience as a whole.\u201d Self-\nlearning through these courses can help fulfil the predominant gap of skill\nmismatch. In this article, we will introduce you to a few courses from the\nivy-league schools and other reputed institutions that are available online.\n\n## **Stanford Engineering Everywhere**\n\nSEE offers software and other courses that are free to both students and\nteachers/instructors. The materials include course syllabi, lecture videos,\nassignments and even online exams.\n\n## **MIT Open Courseware**\n\nMIT Open Courseware, also known as the OCW, initiated the Open Education\nConsortium. This project was launched back in 2002, and offers the full\ncontent of about 50 real MIT courses online. Later, it included most of the\nMIT course curriculum absolutely free of cost, along with hundreds of other\nhigher education institutions with their own OCW materials.\n\n### **MIT Video**\n\nThis is another MIT online learning project that offers over 12000\ntalks/lecture videos for free. This project has 100 channels in total, which\ninclude theoretical as well as practical courses on architecture and planning,\nbiological engineering, robotics and many more.\n\n### **Stanford Online**\n\nThis is a compilation of free courses available for anyone, anywhere, anytime.\nThese courses address topics of engineering, software and various aspects of\nskill development including language, writing, etc.\n\nHowever, making the proper use of these courses to ensure effective learning\nis another business. From this vast range of courses, finding your strengths\nand actual interests is the key to ensure effective learning. Raghib Noor\nsaid, \u201cMy opinion is that not everyone is built for everything. Just find\nsomething you like, and try out the free introductory courses related to it.\nThen just build on it gradually.\u201d Procrastination will be a huge obstacle in\nyour path towards effective learning. Consistency should not be a problem once\nyou find something that you are truly interested in, and it will take you way\nahead.\n\n_Nahaly Nafisa Khan is an Economics major currently studying in Dhaka\nUniversity. She procrastinates a lot, yet is obsessed with meeting deadlines.\nYou can reach her at[nahalynafisa@gmail.com](mailto:nahalynafisa@gmail.com)._\n\n### Stay updated on the go with [The Daily Star](https://www.thedailystar.net)\nAndroid & iOS [News App](https://www.thedailystar.net/apps-\nupgrade/index.html).

Since then,\nWindows administrators have recognized the benefits of using PowerShell for a\nrange of administrative tasks, whether at the command line or from its GUI.\nToday, PowerShell is tightly integrated with Windows, Windows Server and other\nWindows products, and it's available for Linux and MacOS as well.\n\nIn fact, PowerShell now replaces the Windows Command Prompt in the default\nWindows menus, as its capabilities completely overtake and eclipse the older,\nDOS-inspired command line. Whether your aim is run-of-the-mill Windows\nadministration or you're branching out into the cloud or DevOps, knowing your\nway around PowerShell can improve the efficiency of your workaday tasks.\n\nIf you need to brush up on all things PowerShell, check out these free\ntraining and general resources before investing money in any formal courses.\n\n## Microsoft\n\nWith the retirement of the Microsoft Virtual Academy (MVA) in June 2019,\nMicrosoft Learn is a logical first stop in a search for free learning sources\nfor Microsoft products. To get started, go to the main [Microsoft\nLearn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) page, click the \"browse all\"\nlink, and search \"PowerShell.\"\n\nThe site is fairly new and focuses mainly on Azure and various business apps\n(Microsoft Dynamics 365, PowerApps, Power BI), so its PowerShell offerings are\nsparse as of this writing. Check back occasionally to see if more PowerShell\ncontent has been added. It's possible that Microsoft will update some of the\nnumerous courses that were available on MVA and host them on Microsoft Learn.\n\n## PowerShell.org\n\nSupporting all platforms and languages that use PowerShell, this site's [Free\nResources](https://powershell.org/free-resources/) section is a portal to\ne-books and the PowerShell.org YouTube channel (which has more than 100\nvideos). The Build Server section lets you sign up for virtual instances of\nPowerShell for testing and learning purposes.\n\nWhile you're on PowerShell.org, be sure to browse the articles, forums and\nPowerScripting podcast series, all of which are current and chock-full of\nPowerShell how-to information.\n\n## Channel 9\n\nChannel 9 provides hundreds of short-form and in-depth videos on using\nPowerShell with Windows Server, Microsoft Azure, Office 365, Hyper-V and\nAmazon Web Services. (Search \"[PowerShell](https://channel9.msdn.com/)\" on the\nChannel 9 main page.) You can also pick up tips for using PowerShell cmdlets\nand scripts in the real world, as well as insights on IT roles and career\ndevelopment, such as why an IT pro should become a developer (and the other\nway around).\n\nIf you're using PowerShell 5, the [Ed Wilson\nseries](https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/The-Scripting-Guys) comes highly\nrecommended.\n\n## edX\n\nedX has become a premier source of free learning opportunities over the years.\nThe site features only a few PowerShell courses at present, but beginners may\nfind [Windows PowerShell Basics](https://www.edx.org/course/windows-\npowershell-basics-1) a great first step. It's archived, so you would take the\ncourse as an \"auditor\" and have access to course materials but would not take\npart in active course discussions or receive a grade. If you prefer more\nactive learning, visit the site every month or so to see if and when the\ncourse will be repeated live.\n\n[PowerShell Security Best Practices](https://www.edx.org/course/powershell-\nsecurity-best-practices-2) is a free, self-paced course created by Microsoft\nand delivered through the edX platform. Although the course covers PowerShell\nfundamentals, its focus is on security, administration and exploits. There's\nalso a lab component for hands-on learning. You can choose to pay an\nadditional fee (currently $99) for a verified certificate upon completion.\n\n## Veeam Software\n\nVeeam specializes in cloud data management, backup, and disaster recovery for\nAWS, Azure, IBM Cloud, VMware and\n[Hyper-V](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/11003-essential-powershell-\ncmdlets-for-managing-hyper-v.html). Because PowerShell is an essential tool\nfor managing Windows-based cloud technologies, the company also offers an in-\ndepth, eight-lesson [PowerShell tutorial](https://go.veeam.com/learn-\npowershell-basics-free-tutorial-course/) that covers reading and writing to\nthe console, functions, looping and branching, collections, formatting, and\nmore.\n\n## GitHub\n\nNestled under the PowerShell Team repository on GitHub is the [Learning\nPowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master/docs/learning-\npowershell) doc, which takes you step by step through installing PowerShell,\nusing the PowerShell editor, debugging and testing. There's also a map book\naimed at seasoned Bash users who want to ramp up more quickly.\n\nThe [DevOps Collective](https://github.com/devops-collective-inc) on GitHub is\na repository of short books and articles on PowerShell gotchas and how-tos,\nwith code examples. Find out about handling errors, generating historical and\ntrend reports, networking, remoting, and a lot more.\n\n## PowerShell training with free trial periods\n\nMost for-a-fee training providers provide a free trial period, typically one\nto two weeks, during which you can take a course or two to see if they're a\ngood fit for you and to get a feel for the depth and quality of training\nbefore you pay. Here are a few providers you may want to consider when laying\ndown hard cash for training:\n\n  * **Pluralsight** : This well-known training library includes a plethora of courses on [PowerShell](https://www.pluralsight.com/search?q=powershell&categories=all), taught by experts such as Jeffrey Snover, Jeff Hicks and Mark Minasi.\n  * **CBT Nuggets** : The free trial doesn't include Kaplan IT Training practice exams but gives you access to courses. [PowerShell 6 Foundations](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/powershell-6-foundations) and [PowerShell Reference Training](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/microsoft-windows-powershell-2-3-4) are most pertinent to PowerShell users.\n  * **Lynda.com (LinkedIn Learning)** : This site offers several [PowerShell](https://www.lynda.com/PowerShell-training-tutorials/5779-0.html) courses and more than 300 video tutorials across the beginner, intermediate and advanced levels. Lynda.com is considered a terrific resource for online, video-based learning, especially for those looking to hone their coding skills.\n\nAlso swing by the [Udemy PowerShell\nCourses](https://www.udemy.com/topic/powershell/) page occasionally. Although\nthe site charges a fee, you can usually find terrific deals, such as full\ncourses for a mere $9.99 (which is nearly free).\n\n## General resources: Microsoft, blogs and other sources\n\nYou can glean a lot of information on PowerShell learning and use by browsing\nthese resources:\n\n  * **[Windows PowerShell Survival Guide](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/183.windows-powershell-survival-guide.aspx): **This is perhaps the mother lode of resources \u2013 Microsoft's list of lists for PowerShell.\n  * **[Scripting with Windows PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb978526.aspx):** Fully updated for PowerShell 6, this TechNet site provides a user guide, numerous help topics, cmdlet references and lots of sample scripts.\n  * **[PowerShell Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/#pivot=main&panel=getstarted): **This site is mainly a graphical front end for the preceding site, but clicking the Community link gives you a launchpad to all kinds of PowerShell resources, including a few covered in this article. Be sure to check out the r/PowerShell community on Reddit, where users are eager to answer questions and help resolve nearly any type of PowerShell challenge.\n  * **[Learn PowerShell Scripting in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-powershell-scripting-in-a-month-of-lunches):** Although the book runs $35.99 to $44.99, you can read the entire thing online for free using the links on this page.

Although Microsoft doesn't offer a certification based\nsolely on PowerShell, the company has peppered several of its certifications \u2013\nincluding the ever-popular Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA) and\nMicrosoft Certified Solutions Expert\n([MCSE](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10714-evergreen-it-\ncertifications.html)) certifications \u2013 with PowerShell questions.\n\nWhether you earn a certification or simply develop working knowledge of\nPowerShell, you can't go wrong investing time to learn all you can about this\nvaluable tool.\n\nFinally, as we write this story in mid-2019, we must note that PowerShell 7 is\nin beta test and expected to hit public release before year's end. Keep an eye\non any or all of the sites mentioned here for coverage of the upcoming\nPowerShell version, and be ready to jump on it as soon as it's cooked.\n\n![](https://img.business.com/w/80/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2ltYWdlcy9hdXRob3IvNTkxLzMxNmYyY2Y4MzhlY2M0YThiNDU2OC80MDAtNDAw)\n\nKim Lindros\n\n    \n\nKim Lindros is a full-time content developer who writes about security,\ntechnology and business.

For 20\nyears, Flash was the fundamental technology for web-based audio and video\nplayers too numerous to list.\n\nAs such, it is very likely a technology you have used in your own training\nmaterials featuring audio or video content.\n\nSo, how can you prepare for the impending death of Flash? First, take a moment\nto reflect on the good times you had with Flash and try not to focus on the\nloss. Flash was always there for you, but all things must end, and you have\nbigger things to worry about.\n\nFor example, do you need to toss all your training content and re-develop\neverything from scratch? Not necessarily. But before we explore how to keep\nyour online training healthy and accessible through this important change,\nlet\u2019s look at how we got here and where we\u2019re going.\n\n**How big Is the change?**\n\nIt\u2019s big. At one time it was estimated that nearly 75% of animation and video\ncontent found on the Internet was reliant on Flash technology to some extent.\nThat number has decreased, but it\u2019s still up there and high enough that\nregardless of the years of advanced notice, many will still be caught unaware\nwhen the final bell tolls.\n\n> First, take a moment to reflect on the good times you had with Flash and try\n> not to focus on the loss.\n\n**Why Is Flash going away?**\n\nBack in 2010, Steve Jobs delivered 'Thoughts on Flash', a detailed depiction\nof Flash as a dying technology, and why Apple would not install or support the\nplayer on any iOS devices \u2013 most notably, iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, which\nwere exploding in popularity at the time.\n\nIn the now-infamous memo, Jobs highlights aspects of the technology he\nconsidered harbingers of its demise, specifically: incompatibility with\ntouchscreen devices, abysmal security, and the software\u2019s reputation as a\nnotorious resource hog, among others.\n\nFurther, in the context of innovation and technological liberty, Jobs cited\nthe need to eliminate reliance on third-party software 'coming between the\nplatform and the developer'.\n\nThese were powerful assertions made in the midst of a burgeoning technical\nclimate and regardless of whether Jobs was simply a prophet of Flash\u2019s decline\nor its primary architect, his points were well made. In years since, Flash\u2019s\nfate has been further sealed with ever-increasing mobile usage and the rise of\nmore stable, scalable, and compatible media formats like HTML5.\n\nNew options, coupled with ongoing failure to address long-standing concerns\nsimply proved too much to overcome. Ultimately, the fall of the once-mighty\nFlash empire came down to natural selection.\n\n**What will replace Flash?**\n\nNew technologies are already in widespread use that do not rely on Flash.\nYou\u2019ve most likely heard it described as 'HTML5', an updated standard\nsupporting a wide array of audio and video elements with broader browser\nsupport and accessibility across devices of all types.\n\nIn non-tech speak, it means the standard works everywhere on everything and\ncan be tweaked by anyone to work where they want it to \u2013 sorry Adobe, we just\nwant to set our web content free.\n\n**What does this mean for your training materials?**\n\nAs mentioned, it\u2019s very possible your company has legacy (aka 'old') content\ndeveloped using Flash technology that has not been re-developed using an\nacceptable post-Flash format. Failing to convert that content prior to the\ndiscontinuation of Flash will result in that content no longer being\naccessible in modern browsers including desktop and mobile devices.\n\nIt\u2019s simply not going to work anymore. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s not enough that\nFlash will bid its long-overdue farewell in 2020, it might drag your legacy\ncourseware with it when it goes. Fortunately, there\u2019s hope.\n\n**How can you keep your Flash-based content going for future generations?**\n\nThe short answer is \u2013 you can\u2019t, the content will need to be converted from\nFlash to HTML5. If you have the original files used to create the content and\nthe software used during development, you may be able to simply re-export the\ncontent\u2019s media to HTML5, then re-deploy the content.\n\n> Whatever approach you choose to address the situation, your priority should\n> be preserving the impact your organisation\u2019s training content has on\n> performance well past the expiration of Flash and beyond.\n\nSpecific steps to accomplish this conversion depend on the development tool\nand you can find more information on your software vendor\u2019s website or support\nknowledge base. Of course, you may encounter challenges if you don't have\naccess to the content source files or the technical expertise on staff to\nperform the necessary revisions and testing.\n\n**Opportunity to improve?**\n\nIn order to avoid repeating this process just a few years down the road, you\nmay discover a more thorough renovation of your courseware is warranted.\nConsider recreating content, refreshing messaging, and updating learning\nobjectives.\n\nThis can be a great opportunity to enhance the overall learning experience\nwhile increasing the effectiveness of your training, especially for the\nyounger workforce. Ask tough questions: 'Is video really the best approach?',\n'Are animations bringing any added results?',  'Do \u2018M.A.S.H\u2019 references still\nresonate with learners?'\n\n**Preservation is priority**\n\nWhatever approach you choose to address the situation, your priority should be\npreserving the impact your organisation\u2019s training content has on performance\nwell past the expiration of Flash and beyond. Let\u2019s face it, all replacement\nformats will one day follow Flash\u2019s long, slow march to the grave.\n\nSuch is the inevitability of technological advancement and we\u2019re lucky to be\npart of it. Seriously.\n\nBut, learning is about the design and content, not the technology used to\ndeliver it. Even if you choose to ignore these suggestions - reminders -\nwarnings regarding the end of Flash, be sure the content survives! Don\u2019t be\nlike me, the guy who can\u2019t enjoy his '80\u2019z Jamz' mix tape because he can\u2019t\nfind a cassette player.\n\nWhat happens if you\u2019ve had the presence of mind to take the crucial step of\npreserving the content but...it\u2019s in multiple formats including documents,\nvideos, webinars, napkin drawings, etc? The fact is, YOU have the building\nblocks, but if you\u2019re not a courseware developer, you\u2019re up a creek without a\ncassette player.\n\nGood news \u2013 more hope. Technologies are emerging for the specific desire to\nbring cherished content, whether on Beta Max or Laser DISC, into the future.\n\n**R.I.P. Flash**\n\nThe death of Flash marks a milestone in browser advancement and courseware\ncapabilities.

However, there\nare also many certifications and programs in this area that are far less\ntransparent and widely known.\n\nThere's been a steady demand for digital forensics certifications for the past\nseveral years, mainly owing to the following:\n\n  * Computer crime continues to escalate. As more cybercrimes are reported, more investigations and qualified investigators are needed. This is good news for law enforcement and private investigators who specialize in digital forensics.\n  * There's high demand for qualified digital forensics professionals because nearly every police department needs trained candidates with suitable credentials.\n  * IT professionals interested in working for the federal government (either as full-time employees or private contractors) must meet certain minimum training standards in information security. Digital forensics qualifies as part of the mix needed to meet them, which further adds to the demand for certified digital forensics professionals.\n\nAs a result, there is a continuing rise of companies that offer digital\nforensics training and certifications. Alas, many of these are \"private label\"\ncredentials that are not well recognized. Making sense of all options and\nfinding the right certification for you may be trickier than it seems.\n\nTo help choose our top five certifications for 2019, we looked at several\npopular online job boards to determine the number of advertised positions that\nrequire these certifications. While the actual results vary from day to day\nand by job board, this should give you an idea of the number of digital\nforensic jobs with specific certification requirements.\n\n## Job board search results (in alphabetical order, by certification)*\n\n|\n\n|\n\n**[SimplyHired](http://www.simplyhired.com/) **\n\n|\n\n**[Indeed](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10755-best-digital-forensics-\ncertifications.html) **\n\n|\n\n**[LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) **\n\n|\n\n**[LinkUp](http://linkup.com) **\n\n|\n\n**Total**  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n**Vendor neutral**  \n  \n**CFCE (IACIS)**\n\n|\n\n63\n\n|\n\n82\n\n|\n\n117\n\n|\n\n46\n\n|\n\n**308**  \n  \n**CHFI (EC-Council)**\n\n|\n\n106\n\n|\n\n140\n\n|\n\n253\n\n|\n\n68\n\n|\n\n**567**  \n  \n**GCFA (SANS GIAC)**\n\n|\n\n422\n\n|\n\n489\n\n|\n\n857\n\n|\n\n294\n\n|\n\n**2,062**  \n  \n**GCFE (SANS GIAC)**\n\n|\n\n203\n\n|\n\n226\n\n|\n\n433\n\n|\n\n143\n\n|\n\n**1,005**  \n  \n**Vendor specific**  \n  \n**ACE (AccessData)**\n\n|\n\n25\n\n|\n\n29\n\n|\n\n31\n\n|\n\n12\n\n|\n\n**97**  \n  \n**EnCE (EnCase)**\n\n|\n\n110\n\n|\n\n154\n\n|\n\n237\n\n|\n\n114\n\n|\n\n**615**  \n  \n*We covered two GIAC credentials, presented together in a single GIAC section below.\n\nDigital forensics is a relatively lucrative space for practitioners. The\naverage salary for intermediate digital forensic jobs in the U.S. \u2013 $63,959,\naccording to SimpyHired \u2013 trails that of network engineers, system\nadministrators and project managers. However, a senior specialist or forensic\nanalyst, whether working in the private industry or government channels, will\noften earn six figures in major metro areas. We found salaries on the high end\nrunning almost $107,000 for forensic analysts and more than $127,000 for\ndigital forensic roles.\n\n## ACE: AccessData Certified Examiner\n\nAccessData is the maker of the popular Forensic Toolkit (FTK) solution for\ndigital investigations. The company also offers a variety of related products\nand services, such as AD Lab, AD eDiscovery, AD Enterprise and AD Triage.\n\nThe AccessData Certified Examiner\n([ACE](http://accessdata.com/training/computer-forensics-certification)) is\nworth pursuing for those who already use or plan to use FTK, which enjoys\nwidespread use in law enforcement and private research and consulting firms.\nThe certification requires one exam, which covers the FTK Imager, Registry\nViewer, PRTK (Password Recovery Toolkit) and FTK Examiner Application/Case\nManagement Window tools in detail. AccessData recommends basic to moderate\nforensic knowledge before attempting the exam. This includes an understanding\nof digital artifacts, Registry files, encrypting and decrypting files,\nhashing, attack types, using live and index searching, and other topics. See\nthe latest [ACE Study\nGuide](http://accessdata.com/assets/pdfs/ACE%20Study%20Guide%202017-WEB.pdf)\nfor details.\n\nRecertification is required every two years.

This organization caters\nprimarily to law enforcement personnel, and you must be employed in law\nenforcement to qualify for regular IACIS membership.\n\nA formal application form, along with an application fee, is necessary to join\nIACIS. Regular membership includes current computer/digital forensic\npractitioners who are current or former government or law enforcement\nemployees or forensic contractors to a government agency. All other\npractitioners can apply for Associate membership to IACIS, provided they can\npass a background check. [Membership\nfees](https://www.iacis.com/membership-2/membership-overview/) and annual\nrenewal fees are required. IACIS membership is not required to obtain the CFCE\ncredential.\n\nTo obtain the CFCE credential, candidates must demonstrate proficiency with\nCFCE core competencies. One option is IACIS' Basic Computer Forensic Examiner\n([BCFE](https://www.iacis.com/training/basic-computer-forensics-examiner/))\ntwo-week training course; it meets the 72-hour training requirement, costs\n$2,995, includes a free laptop and waives the IACIS membership fee for\nnonmembers. IACIS membership is required to attend the course. Candidates\ncompleting the training course can enroll directly in the CFCE program upon\ncompletion of the course. Those not attending the BCFE course may meet the\n72-hour training requirement with a comparable course (subject to IACIS\napproval), pay a $750 registration fee, and successfully pass a background\ncheck to enroll in the CFCE program and sit for the exam.\n\nThe CFCE exam is a two-step testing process that includes a peer review and\nCFCE certification testing:\n\n  1. The peer review consists of accepting and completing four assigned practical problems based on core knowledge and skills areas for the credential. These must be solved and then presented to a mentor for initial evaluation (and assistance, where needed) before being presented for peer review. Candidates have 30 days to complete each of the practical problems.\n  2. Upon successful conclusion of the peer review, candidates automatically progress to the certification phase. \n    * Candidates must begin work on a hard-drive practical problem within seven days of the completion of the peer review phase. Forty days are allotted to candidates to independently analyze and report upon a forensic image of a hard drive provided to them. Following specific instructions, a written report is prepared to document the candidate's activities and findings.\n    * Once that report is accepted and passed, the process concludes with a 100-question written exam (which includes true/false, multiple-choice, matching and short-answer questions). Candidates have 14 days to complete the written examination. A passing score of 80 percent or better is required for both the forensic report and the written exam to earn the CFCE.\n\nUpon completion of both the peer review and the certification phase,\ncandidates must submit a notarized form certifying that the practical and\nwritten exams were completed independently without assistance from anyone\nelse.\n\nCertificants must [recertify](https://www.iacis.com/certification-2/cfce-re-\ncertification/) every three years to maintain the CFCE credential.\nRecertification requires proof of at least 40 hours of professional education,\na passing score on a proficiency test in the third year, proof of\ncomputer/digital forensics work experience, or passing scores on three\nproficiency tests within three years, and either three years of IACIS\nmembership or payment of a $150 recertification fee.\n\nDespite the time and expense involved in earning a CFCE, this credential has\nhigh value and excellent name recognition in the computer forensics field.\nMany forensics professionals consider the CFCE a necessary merit badge to\nearn, especially for those who work in or for law enforcement.\n\n### CFCE facts and figures\n\n|\n\n**Certification name**\n\n|\n\nCertified Forensic Computer Examiner (CFCE)  \n  \n---|---  \n  \n**Prerequisites and required courses**\n\n|\n\nBasic Computer Forensics Examiner (BCFE) training course recommended ($2,995)  \n  \n72 hours of training in computer/digital forensics comparable to CFCE core\ncompetencies; BCFE training course meets training requirement  \n  \nWithout BCFE training: take a comparable course, pay $750 registration fee and\npass a background check  \n  \n**Number of exams**\n\n|\n\nTwo-part process: Peer review (must pass to proceed to subsequent phase) and\ncertification phase (includes hard-drive practical and written examination)  \n  \n**Cost per exam**\n\n|\n\nIncluded in BCFE training; $750 for the entire testing process for those not\nattending BCFE training  \n  \n**URL**\n\n|\n\n<https://www.iacis.com/certification-2/cfce/>  \n  \n**Self-study materials**\n\n|\n\nIACIS is the primary conduit for training and study materials for this\ncertification.  \n  \n## CHFI: Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator\n\nThe EC-Council is a well-known training and certification organization that\nspecializes in the areas of anti-hacking, digital forensics and penetration\ntesting.

It is a well-respected and highly\nregarded player in the information security field in general. SANS not only\nteaches and researches in this area, it also provides breaking news, operates\na security alert service, and serves on all kinds of government, research and\nacademic information security task forces, working groups, and industry\norganizations.\n\nThe organization's incident response and forensics credentials include the\nfollowing:\n\n  * GIAC Certified Forensic Examiner (GCFE)\n  * GIAC Certified Forensic Analyst (GCFA)\n  * GIAC Reverse Engineering Malware (GREM)\n  * GIAC Network Forensic Analyst (GNFA)\n  * GIAC Advanced Smartphone Forensics (GASF)\n  * GIAC Cyber Threat Intelligence (GCTI)\n\nThe intermediate GCFE and the more senior GCFA are the focus of this section.\nNeither credential requires taking SANS courses (which have a strong\nreputation for being among the best in the cybersecurity community, with high-\npowered instructors to match), but they are recommended to candidates and\noften offered before, during or after SANS conferences held around the U.S. at\nregular intervals.\n\nBoth the GCFE and GCFA focus on computer forensics in the context of\ninvestigation and incident response, and thus also focus on the skills and\nknowledge needed to collect and analyze data from Windows and/or Linux\ncomputer systems during such activities. Candidates must possess the necessary\nskills, knowledge, and ability to conduct formal incident investigations and\nadvanced incident handling, including dealing with internal and external data\nbreaches, intrusions, and cyberthreats; collecting and preserving evidence;\nunderstanding anti-forensic techniques; and building and documenting advanced\ndigital forensic cases.\n\nMost SANS GIAC credentials are valid for four years. Candidates may\n[recertify](https://www.giac.org/certifications/renewal) for the GCFE and GCFA\nby earning 36 continuing professional experience (CPE) credits. In addition,\ncredential holders must pay a certification maintenance fee of $429 every four\nyears.\n\nThe SANS GIAC program encompasses more than 36 information security\ncertifications across a broad range of topics and disciplines.

The CyberSecurity\nInstitute provides digital forensic services aimed at law firms, businesses\nand individuals, and administers a small but well-respected certification\nprogram. The CSFA is designed for security professionals with at least two\nyears of experience performing digital forensic analysis on computers and\ndevices running the Windows operating system and creating investigative\nreports. Although the certification didn't generate as many job board hits as\nour other featured certifications, the CSFA is still worth your attention.\n\nThe same goes for the Certified Computer Examiner\n([CCE](http://www.isfce.com/index.html)) from the International Society of\nForensic Computer Examiners, also known as ISFCE. The CCE is well recognized\nin the industry and in the law enforcement community as a leading credential\nfor digital forensics professionals, but it fell a little short on job board\nhits during our review this year.\n\nOther good certifications include the Professional Certified Investigator\n([PCI](https://www.asisonline.org/Certification/Board-\nCertifications/PCI/Pages/default.aspx)), a senior-level, vendor-neutral\ncomputer investigations and forensics credential available through ASIS\nInternational. The organization also offers the Certified Protection\nProfessional ([CPP](https://www.asisonline.org/Certification/Board-\nCertifications/CPP/Pages/default.aspx)), which includes an investigation\ncomponent, and the Physical Security Professional\n([PSP](https://www.asisonline.org/Certification/Board-\nCertifications/PSP/Pages/default.aspx)) in its certification program.\nForensics candidates can also pursue one of the [High Tech Crime\nNetwork](http://www.htcn.org/site/certification-requirements.html) vendor-\nneutral certifications \u2013 the Certified Computer Crime Investigator or\nCertified Computer Forensic Technician, both of which have a Basic and an\nAdvanced credential.\n\nIf you look around online, you'll find numerous other forensics hardware and\nsoftware vendors that offer certifications and plenty of other organizations\nthat didn't make the cut for the 2019 list of the best digital forensics\ncertifications. But before you wander outside the items mentioned in this\narticle, you might want to research the sponsoring organization's history and\nthe number of people who've earned its credentials, and then determine whether\nthe sponsor not only requires training but stands to profit from its purchase.\n\nYou might also want to ask a practicing digital forensics professional if\nthey've heard of the certifications you found on your own and, if so, what\nthat professional thinks of those offerings.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\n  * [ ![Best InfoSec and Cybersecurity Certifications of

gotta get out more. Or maybe be more selective in the places I get out to.\nHere I had been laboring under the notion that pilot training and pilots\nthemselves are probably as competent as they\u2019ve ever been.\n\nAnd why would I think this? Mainly accident rates, both in general aviation\nand in for-hire flying, which I analyze compulsively.  These are at all-time\nhistorical lows and although we and other news outlets keep publishing stories\nabout the erosion in stick-and-rudder skills, pilots keep having fewer\naccidents. Maybe their underwear is just soiled, but not bloody.\n\nIn spending a couple of days this week rubbing elbows with DPEs and\ninstructors at Redbird\u2019s Migration training conference in Denver, I heard some\ndiscouraging stories about the low caliber of applicants\u2014especially\ninstructors\u2014who are percolating through the training system. Roger Sharp, late\nof Redbird and now a DPE in Texas and author of the self-published _20 Ways to\nFail Your Flight Test: A Practical Guide to Earning Your Notice of\nDisapproval_ , told us several horror stories, including one of the applicant\nwhose instructor told him short field landings should be done without flaps.\n\nTodd Shellnutt, a DPE for ATP, shared similar tales with me and although we\nboth agreed this sort of thing has been going on for years, it may be worse\nnow for the pressure being put on pilot hiring. The last time I remember pilot\nuptake being this hot was during the 1960s, when several airlines took people\noff the street, trained them, and put them in the third seat, when there was a\nthird seat. We didn\u2019t call it ab initio then, but that\u2019s what it was. Later in\nthe same decade, when pilots came home from the Vietnam war, the trend\nreversed.\n\nThere's much comment about how we're just teaching to the test. Ya think? I\nheard that when I was a callow 19-year-old student pilot. I didn't exactly\nhave a lot of money for seasoning from some of those steely-eyed old veterans\nhaunting the flight school shack. (They were probably 25.) So they taught me\nto pass the checkride, I did, and survived the first 500 hours without killing\nmyself. I'm a better aviator for it, for lessons learned alone while scaring\nmyself half to death. You tend to remember better under those conditions.\n\nAt the industry events I attend, there\u2019s always someone talking about future\npilot demand and how the supply will fall short. While this appears to be\ntrue, I think there are gradations to it. If the demand for training were at\nthe high end of the described scale, wouldn\u2019t Cessna and Piper, between them,\nbe selling more than the 60 training airplanes per quarter that they are now?\nOr is that now what constitutes high volume? Beats me.\n\nOne of the goals of the Migration conference is to showcase the latest in\ncutting-edge training techniques using simulators and computer-based\ntechnology. It was attended by about 300 people, with 70 percent this year who\nhad never attended before and thus missed some of Sharp\u2019s more twisted jokes.\n\nWhile Redbird has made inroads in the use of simulators as integrated training\ntools, lots of schools still don\u2019t use them, either because they can\u2019t afford\nthem or don\u2019t believe in them. In some instances, instructors don\u2019t like them\nbecause using them doesn\u2019t allow them to log time towards that airline job.\nSharp says that\u2019s okay with him, because he makes more money on re-tests.\n(Some DPEs, by the way, are charging as much as $1500 for CFI rides.)\n\nAviation in general and flight training in particular exhibit remarkably\nrobust hideboundedess. Early adopters are the true believers in sims and\nonline training, but the old ways die hard. Sharp made one point that some\njust won\u2019t accept: It\u2019s a waste of expensive instructor time for schools to\noffer their own ground schools. John and Martha or Jeppesen do it better and\nit\u2019s all the same stuff.\n\nAs Redbird\u2019s GIFT gains refinement and fielding, the pre-flight and post-\nflight briefing may need some attention, too. GIFT\u2014Guided Independent Flight\nTraining\u2014is a graphics-based app that does just what its title implies. It or\nsomething like it points to an inevitable future. I could preach to the choir\nof Luddites and decry intervention of machines over man, but madly mixing\nmetaphors here, windmills like that are water under the bridge.\n\nAt one breakout seminar I attended, the owner of a South Carolina flight\nschool was explaining how to price the simulator, how to encourage its use\nbeyond the basics and, more important, how to make money with it. And it\u2019s not\njust a money tap on the client\u2019s wallet. Integrated simulator training moves\nstudents through the program more efficiently and, according to the data,\nimproves checkride pass rates.\n\nFlight instruction, dare I say it, is a grind. So is being a busy DPE. The\nburnout rate is not insignificant. Against that backdrop, I\u2019m always inspired\nby people whose passion for aviation and teaching aviation makes my own warm\nfeelings for the calling seem like mere musings. AOPA singled out for awards a\nnumber of flight schools from various parts of the country and yeah, it\u2019s glad\nhanding, but I also noticed many of these were staffed by Millennials, if not\nyounger people. So just take your Millennial jokes and stuff \u2018em\u2026well, you\nknow.\n\nFrom the Ninja-level inspirational dedication file comes Christopher Kreske\nwho, based on student surveys, AOPA picked as the national CFI of the year.\nHe\u2019s a retired F-15 pilot and a current airline pilot but still finds time\u2014and\nmotivation\u2014to instruct. Respect.\n\nFurther respect for one Kirk Lippold, who was commanding officer of the _USS\nCole_ when it was attacked by terrorists in Yemen in 2000. At Migration, he\ngave a riveting talk about the experience and how the crew battled to save a\nship that should have sunk. What does that have to do with aviation? Nothing\nand everything. He related how his decision making was guided by the same\nprinciples pilots much use in sorting through an aircraft emergency. No one\nmoved an inch during his talk, which drew standing applause.\n\nLippold is a Naval Academy graduate and as he described his experience, I\nthought about how effective the military academies can be in molding\nleadership into the people who rise to command. I also thought about his\nexperience in the context of the U.S. Navy\u2019s glorious and world-renowned\nhistory of at-sea damage control in the stories of the _Franklin_ , the\n_Yorktown_ , the _Forrestal_ and the _Enterprise_. On my current recommended\nreading list is _Halsey\u2019s Typhoon_ , the harrowing story of the U.S. Third\nFleet caught in an intense typhoon in the Philippine Sea in December 1944.\n\nThe sea was so violent that airplanes on hangar decks were ripped free of\ntheir chains and caught fire in the subsequent chaos. One ship, the light\ncarrier _USS Monterey_ , was ablaze from stem to stern and ordered by higher\ncommand abandoned in the teeth of a Cat 5 typhoon. The captain demurred and\nsent a young junior grade Lieutenant below to fight the fire. They saved the\nship and that young officer went on to bigger things. His name was Gerald R.\nFord.\n\n#### Other AVwebflash

October 20, 2019 at 4:54 pm\n\nA lot of places where pilot skills are down are places where we won't expect\nto see accident rates rise until much later. These are big flight schools\npumping out new pilots for airlines to put in the right-hand seat.  \nThese pilots are not in command of aircraft themselves or flying privately and\nkilling themselves or wrecking airplanes. Instead they are flying under the\nguidance of more experienced pilots sitting next to them and enjoying a full\narray of automation to assist them.  \nBut what happens when/if these pilots graduate to commands and then have low-\nexperience pilots with limit skills next to them? probably nothing out of the\nordinary, for the most part. As long as things are going well. But when the\nautomation fails, or precise hand-flying skills suddenly are demanded, or the\ntrim of the airplane is inexplicably rolling nose-down, what then?  \nDo we have a system propped up by automation and the skills of prior\ngenerations of pilots who will eventually all retire?\n\nNow, I'm generalizing, of course. Not all pilots coming out of these schools\nare 'inferior' by any means. But there are a lot that I would never allow my\nfamily to fly around in a light airplane with. I've seen them struggling to\nmaintain directional control after landing (but it's fine when you are in a\nlight single on a runway wide enough to land on in any direction), running off\nthe end of grass runways twice as long as necessary for a safe landing,\ngetting lost on crystal clear VFR days. But no matter, they're only required\nto be good enough to pass the tests then watch the automation handle the rest\nin their job flying hundreds of people around in modern airliners.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fare-pilot-\nskills-worse-than-ever%2F)\n\n  3. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a4d7b9be18f4678cff492734c1a2eec4?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Gareth A.

Here in Canada we\nstill have 250 hr zero to hero\u2019s going into Part 121 equivalent right seats.\nSadly this will only change when, not of, we get our Colgan.\n\nOne issue that is biting on. both sides of the border are the instructor\ninstructors. The good senior instructors have mostly been sucked up by airline\nor corporate operators and the ones remaining are all too often the fu*ck ups\nwho got never got hired or more often were fired from their commercial air\nservice.\n\nThe quality of new instructors is IMHO well down from where it was even 5\nyears ago. I was lucky as when I did my initial flight instructor rating in\n1986 I was taught by an X Military guy with 30 yrs instructor experience\nincluding 8 yrs in the Military teaching on Harvard\u2019s (Canadian T6).\n\nMy ego took a big beating but I was a pretty good pilot and instructor when he\nwas finished with me.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fare-pilot-\nskills-worse-than-ever%2F)\n\n  5. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/252344e93f3549e4f997657c8de7d000?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Phil D.

For those\nof you that seek that vaunted airline seat, I suggest these things (all else\nbeing non-problematic):\n\n* Use the checklists as though your life depended on it. If that \"bores\" you, find a career driving a bread truck.  \n* Return to the days when pilots knew the systems of the aircraft, inside-out. Get your 7,000 hour, beer-belly, lazy butts outside and preflight the aircraft. Alternate the legs and alternate the pre/post.  \n* Learn the value of \"checklist challenge/AOM response\", and stay engaged. \"Two wings \u2026 two engines \u2026 two pilots.\"\n\nAnd just remember before you send off that resume: \"where you are now, may\nvery well have been the best job you've ever had.\"\n\n\"Blue skies and tailwinds.\"\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fare-pilot-\nskills-worse-than-ever%2F)\n\n    * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7309bda984e185eda944834dab76bfdc?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Richard P.

At the beginning, I had civilian\nstudents whose flying background was Metroliners and Jet Streams. Those folks\ncould fly an airplane. It was sometimes tough to get them to knock off the\nhand flying and embrace flying with a fully integrated autoflight system and\nflight management computer. At the end, it was the complete opposite. I\nstarted to see what I called \u201cmachine operators\u201d who had to be taught to\noperate the specific flying machine in which they were trying to qualify. They\ndidn\u2019t have the SA or piloting skills of old. Some of my colleagues called\nthem \u201cchildren of the magenta line\u201d.

If pilots are getting by\nwith questionable skill sets, all it takes is a few tragic accidents and, if\nthe black box data analyses show pilots don't know what they don't know, a\nspike is added to the data which changes that story about pilot skills that\nmakes it onto the interweb. Too late for the victims.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fare-pilot-\nskills-worse-than-ever%2F)\n\n  11. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b82ec9430f3f3335652d59968a17f738?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Jim H. October 21, 2019 at 11:11 pm\n\nAre pilot skills worse than ever? If so, the training must be worse than ever.\nWe are all a product of our training. Our experience gained beyond our primary\ntraining has provided us with wisdom\u2026even if some of that wisdom came from\nscaring ourselves almost to death while flying solo.\n\nThere is no doubt that flight training is different than a decade or two ago.\nNow one has to master more than just learning basic stick and rudder skills,\nthere is a new element called systems that are present in most airplanes.\nThese systems could be an iPad/tablet/iPhone with a pilot app to dedicated\nelectronic flight bag. Another component of the news systems is a GPS,\nhandheld or otherwise. Vacuum or electric powered attitude\ninstruments\u2026clustered in round or glass displays. Each of these gauges may\nlook and behave differently depending on what is powering it. ADS-B IN/OUT\nproviding weather, traffic, METARS, TFR's etc\u2026.how does one integrate that\ndevice within the flight. If it is on-board the airplane flown for the check\nride, the student pilot must know and demonstrate it's use.\n\nAnother component or two of newer systems in not just a yoke vs stick, it can\nbe side stick or a center stick instead of a stick between one's legs.\nDifferential braking with a free swiveling nose wheel, direct nose wheel\nsteering, or spring/bungee type of tricycle gear steering in addition to the\ntail-wheel system of ground control. Training airplanes today can have fuel\ninjection or carburetors. A few have adjustable props some don't.\n\nIf we were trained to stall an airplane, we stalled the airplane. If we were\ntaught to avoid the stall but get close to it, noting the flight\ncharacteristics just prior to stall, that is what we demonstrated. Basically,\nwe were all trained to pass the PTS or the new version of that with yet\nanother acronym. Some instructors feel that stick and rudder skills are of\nprimary importance delaying systems knowledge and management for a later date.\nOthers teach that both need to be learned at the same time.\n\nThere is no one size fits all standard for primary flight training. One could\nlearn basic stick and rudder skills in a Cub but would that airplane make a\ngood cross-country teacher? How would a J-3 work for 3 hours of hood work and\nthe required night time. If the flight school has a 172 with a nav/com and\nanother 172 with a glass panel including GPS and ADS-B IN/OUT, is the training\ngoing to be the same? Both get the job done legally, both could use the same\nsyllabus, but because of the on board systems or equipment, the training would\nhave to be modified thereby somewhat different. And within those differences\nthe instructor would be placing a higher or lower priority on things because\nof those differences.\n\nOne could go into class D airspace with the 172 equipped only with a nav/com\nand use a paper sectional, VOR, watch and whiskey compass to get there. And\ncomplete the the legal requirements of gaining a Private Pilot License. The\nother student in the GPS, glass panel, ADS-B equipped airplane would have to\nlearn to use the on-board equipment and complete the PPL check ride just the\nsame. Who is the better pilot? Who has the better skills?\n\nWhen do we measure the skill set of the modern aviator\u2026immediately after the\ncheck ride or at the 500 hour mark? How do we quantify those skills if no one\nhas gotten hurt? As the trends are revealing, we are flying more but crashing\nless.\n\nAs pilots move forward to the professional levels, many airlines and corporate\npilots are flying more and more airplanes with automation. With that\nautomation comes the requirement to understand it and demonstrate it's use. At\nwhich point, if the government, the airlines, and corporate flight departments\ndoes not require the demonstration of hand-flying it without the automation,\nor minimally so, when and where does the pilot get the opportunity to fly\nwithout it? And at whose expense?\n\nWho is the better pilot? The answer is not that simple anymore, especially\nwhen we are hurting less people and bending fewer airplanes. In some ways,\naviation seems to be a sore winner. We aren't happy unless we are complaining\nand unhappy.\n\nWe did not all get the same training, in the same airplane, with the same\nequipment, with the same instructor. We all got individually trained in\nairplanes with tail wheels, nose wheels, with or with out certain radios and\navionics, on grass fields or on paved runways, some on short strips and others\non mile long runways, some in 65HP airplanes some in 310HP airplanes, with or\nwith out iPads/tablets/ADS-B, etc\u2026with all of us required to pass a check ride\nwith some sort of examiner, FAA or otherwise sanctioned, and pass their\nversion of the requirements delegated by the FAA. As varied all of this is, we\nare flying more and crashing less. Who is the better pilot then?\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fare-pilot-\nskills-worse-than-ever%2F)\n\n  12. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d52afd170659e0f1d937fd25974f6769?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Tom C.

October 23, 2019 at 10:48 am\n\nWriting cursive and flying an ADF approach are both antiquated and no longer\nnecessary. But I don't really blame the technology as the cause of the erosion\nof basic flying skills. It's mainly the lack of needing basic stick-and-rudder\nskills in every day flying and the natural human tendency to not practice\nskills that are rarely needed. Perhaps what is lacking in today's training is\ndiscipline training. The discipline to go out and practice skills that aren't\nused that often, like go-arounds or crosswind landing, or hand-flying an\napproach (or even en-route flying). With less sophisticated or stable\naircraft, pilots had no choice but to continually improve their skills.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fare-pilot-\nskills-worse-than-ever%2F)\n\n  13. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e4da888d05eabb3493c8aaf165f90578?s=50&d=mm&r=g) J.D.

Does the better\npilot have superior stick and rudder skills or better judgement? Does the\nbetter pilot exercise better checklist discipline, or have a more complete\nknowledge of the air traffic system? And how do these criteria change as a\npilot progresses from Student Pilot to ATP?\n\nDuring my 21 years in the Air Force as a heavy driver, I thought about this in\ndepth when I had to recommend a junior pilot for upgrade out of a pool of\ncandidates. But how to choose? It was often difficult.\n\nI also believe this is why fighter pilots run the Air Force. Fighter pilots\nhave bomb scores and record and debriefed their Air-Air training engagements.\nThey can quantify and promote the best. Not so simple for transport pilots or\nCessna 172 pilots\u2026\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fare-pilot-\nskills-worse-than-ever%2F)\n\n  14. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4aaaa1840e20b7b2227b93f7a8d486ea?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Gary B.

It's not always an easy question to\nanswer, particularly when \"better\" is defined by multiple subjective measures.\nThe absolute best pilot would be one who has superior stick-and-rudder skills\nAND superior practical systems knowledge AND superior situational awareness\nAND superior knowledge of ATC AND superior avionics knowledge. But such a\npilot doesn't exist, so we have to work with less than that.\n\nPersonally, I see more an erosion in situational awareness than basic stick-\nand-rudder skills. And basic awareness of the current aircraft state\n(altitude, heading, airspeed, trim) can lead to poor stick-and-rudder control.\nSo perhaps it's more a matter of distraction than basic piloting skills.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fare-pilot-\nskills-worse-than-ever%2F)\n\n  15. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9998a7f6dbe644594237656aadc852f5?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Klaus M.

Today's 500 hour pilots are\nmuch better pilots then the 500 hour pilots of the 80's. That's an absolute\nfact I can prove.\n\nEveryday it is easier and easier to publicize ever little mistake. You make a\nbad radio call and the ATC is mandated to report it. You ground loop, land\nwith your gear up or do a forced landing and dozens of cameras are capturing\nit. Chances are if you decide to fly lower in a dense population area and\nyou'll be on the 6 o'clock news.\n\nA Seaplane landing on the Mississippi is national news and causes anxieties in\nthe public. it's not the pilots, it's the nonstop emotional reporting.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fare-pilot-\nskills-worse-than-ever%2F)\n\n    * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a4d7b9be18f4678cff492734c1a2eec4?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Gareth A.

If you're looking for a 'flying cowboy' to\nland you on a sandbar those young pilots are out there also.\n\nThe fact is the accident numbers are going down at the same rate as the\nVietnam era pilots are retiring.\n\nAsk an Air Traffic Controller who they would rather communicate with: a 1500\nhr. 25 year old or the 60 year old captain. For example, I was told by a voice\nfrom the left seat: \"Don't answer them, they'll just ask us to do something\nthat will make us late\".\n\nIn the 70's and 80's the 500 hour pilots would break something on the aircraft\non a regular basis the 500 hour pilots of today go from 100hr. inspection to\n100hr. inspection with everything still working, very few squawks. Tires have\nless flat spots, brakes last twice as long, engines leak less and the paint is\nnot all scratched up from fuel hoses. The aircraft overall is shown more\nrespect. Then the most important above all other criteria in the Air-Taxi\nbusiness is repeat customers. The repeat customers regularly request the low\ntime pilot by name and that's how the bills get paid. Most of our repeat\ncustomers have talked up our young low time pilots many times more often then\nthe seasoned high time grouches that operate the aircraft like an old farm\ntruck.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fare-pilot-\nskills-worse-than-ever%2F)\n\n  16. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/662c5d5bcf95b865ffc088d42964cb8b?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Raf S.

October 24, 2019 at 1:04 pm\n\nI have been a CFI/II/MEI AGI for over 30 years and trained many hundreds of\npilots in general aviation aircraft from Cessna 150's, piston and turboprop\naircraft and B737's. I spent 10 years working as a simulator instructor,\nclassroom instructor and flight instructor for FlightSafety International and\n6 years of that was as a Program Manager for piston and turboprop twins flying\nPart 91 and 135. I've trained pilots from every skill level and background\nfrom a dozen countries. I've taught FBI, DEA, Border Patrol and military\npilots. So, I know just a little about various aspects of flight instructing.\nI was also a high school Special Ed teacher, and am Dyslexic.  \nI have read many articles concerning the present state of pilot training and\nthose who are recieving the training. One commentator said that teaching\nground schools is a waste of CFI time. I totally disagree with that. The most\ncommon thing I observe and have been told by DPE's, is the inability of\ninstructors to teach. Teaching is the most important skill an instructor has.\nOne way, and I am certain of this, to build strong teaching skills, is to\nteach in a classroom. At FSI one of my principle oversite duties as a PM was\nto evaluate my instructors teaching in the classroom and simulators, and I had\nvery high expectations of them. Knowing tbe technical details of a given\naircraft is essential, but to effectively teach the topic was far more\nimportant. Clients in particular were more critical about the classroom\ninstruction than simulator by a great margin. When I interviewed pilots for a\nposition at FSI my first question was how much teaching experience do you have\nin aviation or education. Many applicants had extensive flying backgrounds in\nmilitary and civil aviation, but very few had any teaching bacground in or\noutside of aviation. Ones 's flying background was helpful, but in the final\nanalysis, teaching was again, the deciding factor as to who was hired.  \nOne organization who really understands this is SAFE, Society of Aviation and\nFlight Educators, of which I'm a member. They are dedicator to those teachers\nwho view being instructors as a Profession, not a way to build time. I\nrecommend them highly.  \nAs far as the use of simulators is concerned, and I have taught in every FAA\ncategory of simulators, thr rise of the PC simulator is, in my opinion, the\ngreatest boon to teaching aviation skills. I started with FlightSim in 1985,\nand later Jepp sim for all my students, especially instrument students. The\nability to teach and evaluate student learning is invaluable by using\nsimulators and saves a lot of money. I currently use XPlane 11 and with\nLockheed/Martin PREPR3D and other addons I can teach on my PC and the student\ncan log the time! I teach every lesson from Private, through ATP and all CFI\ncertificates using a PC. Every student also has either FlightSim or XPlane on\ntheir home computer so they can learn through guided practice. In 30 years of\nusing simulators I've never had an applicant fail a checkride. All my CFI\ncandidates learn first how to teach adult learners, and teaching methods. They\nmust learn to effectively teach any topic for which they are certified to a\nvery high level. I also have them teach each flying lesson on the PC first\nbefore we fly the airplane. I use real student pilots for my instructors to\nteach and people who know little about aviation for my instructor candidates\nto develope teaching ability and confidence.  \nThere are many resourses for both instructors and students to use to apply and\nlearn piloting skills. In the 10 years PC simulators have advanced pilot\ntraining like no other innovation. Just look at how British Airways selects\npilot applicants, or Lufthansa. The U.S. Airlines are finally catching on to\nEU training methods.  \nThe most important thing is to train instructors to be professioal educators,\neven if the goal is to fly in the corprate or airline venues at a later time.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fare-pilot-\nskills-worse-than-ever%2F)\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY [Cancel reply](/insider/are-pilot-skills-worse-than-\never/#respond)\n\n[Log in to leave a comment ](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fare-pilot-\nskills-worse-than-ever%2F)\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BMG-HHP-\nCRCad.jpg)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-\nconditions/coronavirus-resource-\ncenter/?utm_source=BMG&utm_medium=sidebarad&utm_campaign=CRC)\n\n#### Marketplace\n\n![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/avweb-aviation-search-\nbanner3.png)\n\n#### Featured Video\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/maxresdefault-1-324x235.jpg)![video](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/themes/Newspaper/images/icons/ico-video-\nlarge.png)](https://www.avweb.com/multimedia/best-of-the-web-f-a-18-carrier-\nrecovery/ \"Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier Recovery\")\n\n[Multimedia](https://www.avweb.com/topics/multimedia/)\n\n### [Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier\nRecovery](https://www.avweb.com/multimedia/best-of-the-web-f-a-18-carrier-\nrecovery/ \"Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier Recovery\")\n\n[Editorial Staff](https://www.avweb.com/author/estaff/) - April 5, 2020\n\nWhen Navy aircraft return to trap aboard a carrier in good weather, it's\ncalled a Case I operation.

The company said\nthe miss was due to FX movements.\n\nUnderlying [revenue was\nflat](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pearson-2019-pretax-profit-\nhalved-2020-02-21?mod=article_inline), as growth elsewhere in the business was\noffset by 12% declines in its U.S. Higher Education Courseware segment \u2014 which\naccounts for 24% of group revenue \u2014 the company said. Headline sales fell 6%\nto \u00a33.9 billion.\n\nThe publisher said operating profit would fall in 2020, forecasting between\n\u00a3410 million and \u00a3490 million. It said \u201cheavy declines\u201d in print sales \u2014 which\nfell 30% in 2019 \u2014 in its U.S. Higher Education Courseware segment would\ncontinue. Students and educational institutions have been shifting [away from\nexpensive academic textbooks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/pearson-\nplunges-as-u-s-students-shun-textbooks-for-online-resources-at-rapid-\npace-51569493176?mod=article_inline) in favor of digital resources in recent\nyears, hurting Pearson\u2019s performance. The company\u2019s digital transformation is\nproving painful and slow going for the company \u2014 digital now accounts for 36%\nof revenue compared with 34% in 2018. Despite a push toward a digital-first\nstrategy and new products set to be added to its online platform, 2020 looks\nset to be another tough year.\n\nThe full-year results and bleak outlook for the year sent the stock 4.5% lower\nto 558p, hovering above recent lows of 533p.\n\nChief Executive John Fallon will step down this year, while Chief Financial\nOfficer Coram Williams will be replaced by deputy CFO Sally Johnson in April.\n\n**Looking ahead.** Numis analysts, led by Gareth Davies, said the results\nprovided \u201cno surprises\u201d from the January update and that the key uncertainty\nat the company remained over who would become CEO, maintaining a sell rating\non the stock. Aside from driving its digital strategy in a bid to turnaround\nthe company\u2019s fortunes, Pearson will also undergo a number of management\nchanges at a key time.

While it's not exactly a core subject for related academic\ncurricula, such as computer science, management information systems (MIS) and\nso forth, PM is something that touches deeply and directly on most IT\nactivities. That probably explains why PM certifications like the Project\nManagement Institute's (PMI's) Project Management Professional (PMP)\ncertification command a constant presence amidst the top 10 top-paying\ncertifications of interest to IT professionals over the past decade.\n\n## What skills do I need to become a project manager?\n\nProject management sits at the heart of most IT activities, including system\ndesign and development, deployment or even maintenance. All these routine\nactivities can also be characterized as projects \u2013 some of massive scope and\nduration, others more quick and evanescent. Indeed, that's why project\nmanagement skills and knowledge are in high demand among IT professionals in\nnearly every specialty and area of technical focus in that field.\n\nThe best project managers possess a great eye for detail and are highly\norganized. Masters of soft skills, PMs are clear, concise, and effective\ncommunicators in both speaking and writing. PMs are excellent problem-solvers\nand negotiators. It's also helpful to possess an understanding of cross-\nfunctional areas, such as supply chain, HR and resource constraints,\nprocurement, finance, and change orders, which may impact overall project\noutcomes.\n\n## **What are some popular project management methodologies?**\n\nAs a project management professional, you'll find no shortage of\nmethodologies. There is no one single \"right\" methodology, and the one you\nchoose to practice will be influenced by factors like the type of project,\nindustry sector and your employer's preference. When choosing PM training\nmaterials, look for materials that complement the PM methodology you want to\npractice.\n\nWhile not an exhaustive list, below are a few of the most popular PM\nmethodologies and frameworks:\n\n  * **Waterfall \u2013** Traditional PM methodology with a linear downward process flow. Design changes are difficult to implement. Project phases include system and software requirements, analysis, design, coding, testing, and operations. It's often used with large projects where defined schedules are required and few changes are expected. \n\n  * **Six Sigma \u2013**[Six Sigma](https://asq.org/) PMs (usually referred to as a Black, Green or Yellow Belt) focus on improving quality and efficiency by identifying what doesn't work and removing it from the process. A Six Sigma Black Belt would define the problem, measure the current process, analyze data, improve the process and then control the future process. \n\n  * **Agile \u2013** Introduced in 2001, Agile was a response to the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and originally geared toward software development. In the Agile framework, teams are collaborative and self-organizing. Projects are incremental and iterative, enabling team members to move quickly and respond to change. \n\n  * **Scrum \u2013** A type of Agile framework, [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum) **** focuses on five core values: courage, commitment, openness, respect and focus. As with Agile, teams are collaborative. Iterations are organized into short blocks of time called sprints, which enable great flexibility to respond to design change. A scrum master (a servant-leader) holds daily meetings where team meetings discuss what they did the day before and what they plan to accomplish each day. \n\n  * **Kanban \u2013** Another type of Agile framework, Kanban is popular in manufacturing environments. Teams are collaborative and self-managing. Kanban practices include visualization, limiting work in progress, flow management, making policies explicit, feedback and collaborative evolution. ****\n\n  * **PMI/PMBOK \u2013** While not strictly a PM methodology, the Project Management Institute's ([PMI](https://www.pmi.org/)) Project Management Body of Knowledge ([PMBOK](https://marketplace.pmi.org/Pages/ProductDetail.aspx?GMProduct=00101602400)) is a well-known and respected standard for project management practices. PMI's certifications, especially its Project Management Professional (PMP) credential, are among the most coveted project management credentials in the industry. PMBOK practices focus on five primary process areas: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. ****\n\n## How long does it take to get a project management certification?\n\nRequirements to earn a PM certification are set by the individual\ncertification provider and may include a combination of exams, specific\ntraining courses, minimum education levels or experience. The requirements to\nearn advanced certs are generally more than those for entry-level credentials.\nFor example, the Project Management Professional (PMP) is one of the most\nhighly prized PM certifications available. In addition to passing a rigorous\nexam, candidates must also possess a combination of education, project\nmanagement education and experience.\n\nCompTIA's Project+, an entry-level certification, recommends that candidates\npossess 12 months' experience before attempting the exam. However, since this\nis a recommendation only, candidates can obtain this PM cert by sitting for\nthe exam only, which makes it the only PM cert we found that is available\nwithout the necessity of additional training, education or experience.\n\nIn the table below, you'll find information about how to obtain five of the\npopular PM certifications.\n\n**Certification** | **Skill level** | **Exams** | **Education/experience**  \n---|---|---|---  \n[CompTIA Project+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/project) |\nEntry | 1 | 12 months' experience recommended  \nCertified Associate in Project Management\n([CAPM](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/certified-associate-capm)) |\nAdvanced  | 1 | High school diploma and 1,500 hours of project experience or\n23 hours of PM education  \nProject Management Professional\n([PMP](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/types/project-management-pmp)) |\nAdvanced  | 1 |\n\nFour-year college degree, 4,500 hours leading and directing projects, plus 35\nhours of PM education;\n\nor\n\nHigh school or associate degree, plus 7,500 hours leading and directing\nprojects, plus 35 hours of PM education  \n  \nCertified ScrumMaster ([CSM](https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-\ncertified/scrum-master-track/certified-scrummaster)) | Entry | 1 | Two-day,\nfee-based training course  \nCertified Six Sigma Black Belt ([CSSBB](https://asq.org/cert/six-sigma-black-\nbelt))  | Advanced  | 1 | Three years of experience in one or more of the Six\nSigma Body of Knowledge areas plus one completed project with signed affidavit\nor two completed projects with signed affidavits  \n  \n##\n\n## What are the best online project management courses?\n\nGiven the incredible popularity and demand for project management skills and\nknowledge, it is no surprise that one can find commercial project management\ntraining courses to fit nearly every schedule and budget. But that does not\nmean there aren't good choices available for free training, too.\n\nWe scoured the internet to bring you the best free options. Here, you'll also\nget pointers to some outstanding low-cost offerings as well. Don't forget,\nmany colleges and universities offer courses aimed at the PMP and related PMI\ncertifications (such as Certified Associate in Project Management, or CAPM,\nPMP add-ons for portfolio and program management, plus other credentials for\nAgile, risk management, scheduling and so forth). These courses cost the same\nas other college courses and are taught in similar fashion. That puts them\nhalfway between low-cost/no-cost options and short-term, higher-priced\nintensive courses from traditional training outlets (such as Global Knowledge,\nNew Horizons and Learning Tree).\n\n## The best of free PMP training: MOOCs and more\n\nAn online education phenomenon is reshaping the training landscape as we know\nit. It's based on free online training courses called MOOCs, short for\nmassively online open courses. These are based on open, high-volume, high-\ncapacity, cloud-based training platforms, such as edX, moodle, COURSEsites,\nUdemy and Versal.\n\nWhile monetization of training is possible on some of these platforms, a MOOC\nis supposed to be free for the taking. Organizations or institutions that\noffer such free courses can still ask for fees for testing, certificates of\ncompletion, and other add-ons or nice-to-haves, but the basic course materials\nremain free to all interested parties.\n\nHere's a short, highly curated list of some of the best of those offerings:\n\n  1. **Cybrary Course CYB-2010:[Project Management Professional](https://app.cybrary.it/browse/course/project-management-professional) \u2013** Professional instructor Vincent McKeown delivers a 10-module series of video lectures, each of which maps to a domain in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) for the PMI PMP certification. At 5:14 in length, the course is neither incredibly detailed nor extensive, but it does provide a useful orientation for those just getting started on the subject.\n  2. **ALISON: Diploma in Project Management (Revised 2017) \u2013** With more than 561,862 students having either taken or now taking this course (from Advanced Learning), this MOOC has seen some serious traction to mostly positive reviews. The course contains three modules, covering 28 topics and takes 10 to 15 hours to complete. While it does not map directly to the PMP or other project management credentials, it does provide a useful introduction to the subject matter.\n  3. **Other ALISON courses on project management \u2013** As a full-fledged MOOC delivery platform, [ALISON](https://alison.com/courses?q=project+management) offers a page called [Project Management](https://alison.com/courses/project-management) among its Courses listings. In addition to the previous diploma item, it lists offerings from XSIQ (two fundamentals in English and Arabic); the Saylor Foundation (five courses, including another [diploma](https://alison.com/course/diploma-in-modern-project-management-theory-and-practice) sequence, an [introduction](https://alison.com/course/Introduction-to-Modern-Project-Management-Theory-and-Practice) [in French]); and topics like [working with clients and project teams](https://alison.com/course/Project-Management-Working-with-Clients-and-Project-Teams); [managing project startup, scheduling and budgeting](https://alison.com/courses/Modern-Project-Management-Managing-the-Project-Start-up-Scheduling-and-Budgeting); [quality, risk, procurement and project closeout](https://alison.com/course/modern-project-management-quality-risk-procurement-and-project-closeout-revised)); and the Aga Khan Foundation.\n  4. **Udemy \u2013** Udemy courses are not always or even often free, but they're very close. A search on project management at [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/) produces 854 courses, of which perhaps half are truly relevant to people interested in some facet of PM. Most cost between $20 and $50 each, although we found many as low as $10 and a few on the high end at $200. A search on PMP produces more than 1,600 free and paid courses. You'll spend a lot of time fiddling with the search engine to find what you want, but there are plenty of choices here.\n  5. **edX.org \u2013**[edX](https://www.edx.org/) gets many of its project management courses via Microsoft these days. Thus, despite a huge catalog of offerings, many of the project management courses relate to Microsoft Project and Microsoft Project Portfolio Management (PPM). We did find a few project management courses from such institutions such as the University of Adelaide, the Rochester Institute of Technology, Australian National University and the University of Washington.\n  6. **MIT Open Courseware \u2013** This site pops up 120 hits on [project management](http://search.mit.edu/search?site=ocw&client=mit&getfields=*&output=xml_no_dtd&proxystylesheet=http://ocw.mit.edu/search/google-ocw.xsl&requiredfields=WT.cg_s:Course+Home%7CWT.cg_s:Resource+Home&sectionlimit=WT.cg_s:Course+Home%7CWT.cg_s:Resource+Home&as_dt=i&oe=utf-8&departmentName=web&courseName=&q=), but 49 for PMP. The results show a profound focus on engineering and business management topics. Nevertheless, there's a lot of interesting stuff here, well worth trawling through for those seeking top-notch offerings.\n  7. **ProjectManager.com \u2013** You'll find more than 100 [training videos](https://www.projectmanager.com/) on all kinds of project management topics. You'll need some time and willpower to stitch a curriculum together here, but there's lots of good material available. ProjectManager.com also maintains a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/projectmanagervideos) where you can easily find training videos.\n  8. **YouTube \u2013** YouTube is rife with project management training videos. Probably the best of these is Dr. Jimmie Flores' massive [free PMP Certification Training Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZORkXBSkjVw), though somewhat dated with a 2011 release. Searches on YouTube for [project management](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=project+management) or [PMP](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=PMP) produce hundreds of thousands of hits.\n  9. **The MOOC List \u2013** [This website](https://www.mooc-list.com/) offers consolidated search for offerings available in the next 30 days (most courses are offered with specific starting dates, so this engine points only to relevant courses starting in the near term). Here, a search for [project management](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=partner-pub-3252929032242305:3580054474&q=project+management&sa=Search&ref=www.mooc-list.com/#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=project%20management&gsc.page=1) produces more than 12,000 hits, including listings for a variety of MOOC platforms, such as [ApnaCourse](https://www.apnacourse.com/).\n  10. **The Oxford Home Study Short Course \u2013** [OHSC](http://www.oxfordhomestudy.com/courses/project-management-courses-online/free-online-courses-with-certificates-in-project-management) offers In Project Management, a 20-hour, free online course that introduces candidates to project management, examines the project life cycle and explores the project management role. A certificate is issued at the end of the course.\n\n## Low-cost stuff also offers some gems\n\nMost [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) courses go for $49, and multicourse\nbundles are also available (such as UC Irvine's [Introduction to Project\nManagement Principles and\nPractices](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/project-\nmanagement?languages=en)). The [Master of Project\nAcademy](https://masterofproject.com/?utm_source=gogle&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=branding&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6bq0mfvE4wIVEvDACh3fVAKjEAAYASAAEgIQMPD_BwE)\noffers numerous [free online\ntraining](https://masterofproject.com/courses/category/FREE%20Courses?affcode=39817_nelcro7d)\ncourses for PM certifications, such as the PMP, CAPM, Six Sigma and Prince 2.\nFor $197 per month, you can purchase an all-course bundle deal for materials\nthat include all Master of Project Academy courses.\n\n## What about higher-priced offerings?\n\nHundreds to thousands of other offerings for project management training at\nhigher costs are readily available around the globe. For PMP or other PMI\ncertifications, there's a whole network of partners who teach an official\ncurriculum. Some are in academia; others offer purely commercial courses. All\nthe biggest training companies offer PMP and related certification training,\nas do the major online training players (Lynda.com, Simplilearn, Pluralsight\nand so forth).\n\n## Where to go from here?\n\nStart digging into the outlets and offerings that interest you most. When\ntraining is free, the only thing you can lose is your time and energy. Thus,\nyou can try things out and pull the plug at any time if they don't work for\nyou. When it comes to for-a-fee training, we recommend looking for online\nreviews, personal recommendations from people you know and trust, and feedback\nfrom former course attendees or materials users to help steer you toward the\ncream of the crop.\n\n![](https://img.business.com/w/80/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2ltYWdlcy91cGxvYWRzL3VzZXIvcHJvZmlsZS9iMTRhMmMxZmEwMTU4YTJmNDY4NTQ1OTcxMzlhMjA2NzhjNGNiLmpwZw==)\n\nBusiness.com Editorial Staff\n\n    \n\nThe purpose of our community is to connect small business owners with\nexperienced industry experts who can address their questions, offer direction,\nand share best practices.

first airplane some new Air Force pilots will fly might be a Pipistrel\nAlpha trainer. The first cohort of 20 potential pilots, all of them either\nabout to become USAF officers or freshly commissioned, completed a course that\nled to 17 them soloing the light sport aircraft. The new program, called the\nAviation-Character-Education (ACE) Solo Flight, is aimed at identifying\npotential pilots from within the ranks as one aspect of its drive to stabilize\nits pilot population. Although some Air Force officers have made the\ntransition to pilot in the past, the ACE program will allow more to try out\nbecause of its low cost. On the mainstream training aircraft, it can cost\n$200,000 to get a new pilot to solo. Pipistrel spokesman Michael Coates said\nthe new program put all 20 candidates through the training for less than half\nof that.\n\nThe program is designed to see if those who want to try becoming pilots have\nthe necessary aptitude and skill to succeed in the real Air Force training\nenvironment. In a contract awarded to Tomorrow\u2019s Aeronautical Museum in\nCompton, California and U.S. Aeroclub in Fullerton, the companies supplied\nfour Alphas and instructors in a course run at Tuskegee, Alabama. In the first\ncourse, 17 candidates soloed, two didn\u2019t have their FAA paperwork in time and\none had to stop training because of persistent motion sickness. The course\nlasted just two weeks. A second intake begins in Compton next month with 30\nstudents flying seven Alphas.  \n\n#### Other AVwebflash

I soloed after about 7 hours. I spent maybe $700 in the early 90s.\nMy oldest got his PPL three years ago at a cost of around 11K with the local\nflying club and about 70 hours of flight time. He is now a Naval Aviator\u2026.just\ncompleted his carrier qualifications with 14 landings and 8 touch and go.\nShould have his wings In August and then off to an F18 training squadron.\n\nEither this article is horribly inaccurate or the Air Force needs to cut\ncosts.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-\nnews%2Fpipistrels-training-future-air-force-pilots%2F)\n\n    * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/62d3594c14b6863a5c4e912810a5b4bb?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Mac H.

What is their mainstream training aircraft, an F-18?\nYes, LSA aircraft typically have lower fuel burns than aircraft certified\nunder 14 CFR Part 23, but fuel cost is a minor piece of the overall cost of\ntraining through solo. Even a slow learner can solo after 15 hours of\ninstruction. With a conservative cost of $125/hour wet for the plane and\n$45/hr for instructor time, that is still only $2,550.00. Was the article off\nby 2 decimal places?\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-\nnews%2Fpipistrels-training-future-air-force-pilots%2F)\n\n  4. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/62d3594c14b6863a5c4e912810a5b4bb?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Mac H.

Electric engines leave a big hole in\npilot training because of the simplicity of the power system. No run-up\nrequired, that I know of; no monitoring of temperatures and lubricant\npressures, Just flip the switch to on and, excepting flight control check and\nATC, you are ready for takeoff. How much will flight range be affected by\nusing cabin heat during cold weather? Or deicing equipment?  \nI have heard no discussion of multi-engine procedures, never mind electric\nengined transport aircraft. Will the weight of high-power engines and\nbatteries require a greater multiplicity of engines for large aircraft? Is\nelectric flight going to progress beyond single-engine airplanes under, say,\n12,500 lbs? Just food for thought.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-\nnews%2Fpipistrels-training-future-air-force-pilots%2F)\n\n    * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/62d3594c14b6863a5c4e912810a5b4bb?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Mac H.

Using glider training\nshould probably do just as well in deciding who is not a \"natural\" pilot.\nPower management is much more a part of flying than just aerodynamics.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-\nnews%2Fpipistrels-training-future-air-force-pilots%2F)\n\n      * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/24d07c76f3591f2158c60c4dbd095f8c?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Tim R.

They contract out to local FBOs to introduce new pilots to\nflying in Cessnas. This is a great deal if you happen to own an FBO. You have\na steady stream of smart students with a government paycheck financing your\noperation. I am not sure if the FBO takes them through the PPL rating, but it\nteaches the new pilots the basics.\n\nI just picked up that the aircraft in the article is electric. Interesting.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-\nnews%2Fpipistrels-training-future-air-force-pilots%2F)\n\n  5. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6c8d5c21ee70e63050c48f0458c1ea94?s=50&d=mm&r=g) MARK W.

The Pipistrel in the photo is rotax-\npowered, not electric. I believe some some commentators here have wandered\ndown the electric rabbit hole inadvertently. I could find nothing in the\narticle that suggested that Alpha Electros are being used. A Pipistrel Alpha\nTrainer has a Rotax 912, I believe.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-\nnews%2Fpipistrels-training-future-air-force-pilots%2F)\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY [Cancel reply](/aviation-news/pipistrels-training-future-\nair-force-pilots/#respond)\n\n[Log in to leave a comment ](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-\nnews%2Fpipistrels-training-future-air-force-pilots%2F)\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BMG-HHP-\nCRCad.jpg)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-\nconditions/coronavirus-resource-\ncenter/?utm_source=BMG&utm_medium=sidebarad&utm_campaign=CRC)\n\n#### Marketplace\n\n![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/avweb-aviation-search-\nbanner3.png)\n\n#### Featured Video\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/maxresdefault-1-324x235.jpg)![video](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/themes/Newspaper/images/icons/ico-video-\nlarge.png)](https://www.avweb.com/multimedia/best-of-the-web-f-a-18-carrier-\nrecovery/ \"Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier Recovery\")\n\n[Multimedia](https://www.avweb.com/topics/multimedia/)\n\n### [Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier\nRecovery](https://www.avweb.com/multimedia/best-of-the-web-f-a-18-carrier-\nrecovery/ \"Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier Recovery\")\n\n[Editorial Staff](https://www.avweb.com/author/estaff/) - April 5, 2020\n\nWhen Navy aircraft return to trap aboard a carrier in good weather, it's\ncalled a Case I operation.

Albert Bandura, a social learning\ntheorist, noted that learning is a process that takes place in a social\ncontext and can occur purely through observation or direct instruction. In the\ndigital age, social learning is taking on a new flavor. With a variety of\nunique learning methods that are fast becoming mainstream - right from micro-\nlearning, e-learning, gamification, just-in-time learning, social learning\ntechnologies are booming.\n\nAmong the myriad social learning technology tools that are available in the\nmarketplace, organizations choose technology tools based on the learning\nculture to meet the employees' needs.\n\nBut how do you make them work?\n\nThe 7 Cs are a great starting point to make an informed decision.\n\n  1. **Content:** Organizations must create and curate the right content in the form of knowledge-based assets, experiences, and expertise. Social learning is all about curating resources that are relevant to the audience.   \n  \n\n  2. **Consumption:** It is also critical to pay attention to how information is consumed.  The content must be usable, searchable, and accessible to reference and reuse.    \n  \n\n  3. **Contribution:** Active participation is fundamental to social learning. Finding ways to support user-generated content plays a crucial role in the success of the learning initiative. HR and business managers must encourage employees to share their learning on an ongoing basis.   \n  \n\n  4. **Conversation:** When employees are encouraged to talk about their work and discuss ideas freely, learning is effective. Conversing about content also makes the key takeaways relevant to the context of the business.   \n  \n\n  5. **Collaboration:** Collaboration is at the heart of social learning. It not only helps frame better ideas, but it also helps foster a culture of teamwork.   \n  \n\n  6. **Connections:** Connections to generate content, share ideas, dispel information- these go a long way in competing in business.   \n  \n\n  7. **Control:** Organizations often forget to exert the necessary oversight to ensure the learning quality and effectiveness. Social learning tools should enable customers to govern the continuum of openness and control as it applies to their business. \n\n### How to apply the 7 Cs for Social Media Learning\n\nEvery organization is different. And so 'the 7 Cs' will need to be\ncontextualized to your company's social learning strategy. Here are some\nconcrete steps that you can take:\n\n  * Create communities of practice (common interest) or communities of purpose (common goals) to foster 'on-the-job' social learning.   \n  \n\n  * Provide platforms and opportunities to initiate on-demand; real-time discussions centered on learning with experts. This will enable people to connect, create content and actively learn. This includes using wikis, blogs, discussion forums and encouraging people to rate, review and comment on courses.  \n  \n\n  * Enable real-time crowdsourcing for content such as YouTube videos, images, etc. to encourage users to contribute content.   \n  \n\n  * The learning environment must bring together coaches, peers and instructors to interact, share knowledge, or teach each other. Encourage conversation by conducting focus groups and soliciting feedback on products, services, and courseware.   \n  \n\n  * Design learning platforms and channels to provide \"learning recommendations\" based on \"most taken,\" \"most highly rated\" or other user-based ratings. This will help build a connection and help initiate conversations around learning. \n\nCompanies are recognizing the value that social learning brings to business;\nhowever, challenges do exist. L&D must work out policies to exert good\ngovernance and control in an increasingly social and democratized environment.\nWide-scale adoption is possible only when workplace social learning tools\nemulate the convenience and simplicity of consumer-based social networking\napplications such as Twitter or Facebook. It is essential to ingrain a\n\"social\" culture- one that embodies values such as openness, transparency,\nconnectivity, communication, and collaboration.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Learning & Development](/category/compensation-\nperformance/training-development?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=training-\ndevelopment \"Browse more in: Learning &amp;

Aeronautical Repair Station Association (ARSA) and ten other aviation\norganizations have come out in opposition of a recently introduced bill aimed\nat increasing FAA oversight of repair stations located outside of the United\nStates. The Safe Aircraft Maintenance Standards Act (H.R. 5119) was introduced\nby U.S. House of Representatives Transportation & Infrastructure Committee\nChairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., last Friday.\n\nProvisions laid out in H.R. 5119\n([PDF](https://transportation.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Introduced%20Text%20of%20Safe%20Aircraft%20Maintenance%20Standards%20Act.pdf))\ninclude annual unannounced FAA inspections for foreign repair stations,\nrequiring certain air carriers to provide detailed monthly maintenance reports\nfor FAA analysis and requiring supervisors and mechanics to be certified under\nFAA regulations regardless of location. The bill would also put a moratorium\non FAA certification of new foreign repair stations if the FAA does not\nimplement the new requirements, including issuing a rule to require security\nassessments of foreign repair station employees, within one year of the bill\nbeing enacted.\n\n\u201cFor years I\u2019ve pressed FAA officials to heed the warnings from its own\nInspector General and to do more to close the gap between our safety standards\nand those of foreign repair stations,\u201d said DeFazio. \u201cThe bill I\u2019m introducing\n\u2026 does just that by establishing one standard of safety regardless of where\nthe aircraft is maintained.\u201d\n\nAccording to a letter ([PDF](http://arsa.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/ContractMaintenanceCoalitionLetter-20191118.pdf)) sent\nby the ARSA-led coalition to the chairman and ranking members of the House\nTransportation & Infrastructure Committee and Aviation Subcommittee, the\ngroups believe the new record-keeping and reporting requirements the bill\nsuggests \u201cdo nothing to help focus regulators on safety critical information\nand will simply overwhelm them with irrelevant data.\u201d In addition, the letter\nstates that H.R. 5119 \u201cputs in place regulatory requirements that would be\nlikely impossible to implement\u201d and runs the risk of impacting cooperation\nwith international aviation authorities \u201cincluding key bilateral aviation\nsafety partners.\u201d\n\nAlong with ARSA, the letter was signed by organizations including the Aircraft\nElectronics Association (AEA), General Aviation Manufacturers Association\n(GAMA), International Air Transport Association (IATA) and National Air\nCarrier Association (NACA).\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [ARSA](https://www.avweb.com/tag/arsa/)\n  *

They are no different than revenue raising traffic cops.\nTheir careers are spent outing each other for a promotion.  \nLet FAA do Traffic Control only and NTSB handle matters of safety. No more\nself certification of any type.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Fflight-safety%2Ffaa-\nregs%2Faviation-organizations-oppose-foreign-maintenance-oversight-bill%2F)\n\n    * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/53db9f95e252e00fb232abcb22bac6b5?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Matt W.

A lot of pt 91 flexibility that exists in the US would go\naway if left to the NTSB.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Fflight-safety%2Ffaa-\nregs%2Faviation-organizations-oppose-foreign-maintenance-oversight-bill%2F)\n\n  3. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ac0a4e84efc9fd78ea9ae352293c8360?s=50&d=mm&r=g) fred d.

How does the European aviation industry regulate themselves?\nAmerica has its FAA for governing rules of how aircraft comply with\nairworthness, airspace use and regulations governing how pilots can fly and\nthe NTSB investigating accidents and incidents to reveal causes and recommend\nmeasures to further air safety to help reduce errors or eliminate them. If\nAmerican aircraft fly to Europe and Asia, similar regulations there allow\nfreedom to use their airspace. Foreign air carriers must adhere to FAA regs to\nfly in USA airspace. Is Europe and Asia complying with FAA standards or have\ntheir own version so a level playing field allows commerce freedom in a\nuniversal airspace with everyone playing by the same rules and not affected by\neconomics or political differences?\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Fflight-safety%2Ffaa-\nregs%2Faviation-organizations-oppose-foreign-maintenance-oversight-bill%2F)\n\n  4. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/53db9f95e252e00fb232abcb22bac6b5?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Matt W.

Like usual Congresspersons who know\nlittle about aviation doing more harm than good. Maybe if Congress would get\noff their collective behinds and properly fund the FAA then maybe the FAA\nwould be able to fully exercise their oversight obligations.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Fflight-safety%2Ffaa-\nregs%2Faviation-organizations-oppose-foreign-maintenance-oversight-bill%2F)\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY [Cancel reply](/flight-safety/faa-regs/aviation-\norganizations-oppose-foreign-maintenance-oversight-bill/#respond)\n\n[Log in to leave a comment ](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Fflight-safety%2Ffaa-\nregs%2Faviation-organizations-oppose-foreign-maintenance-oversight-bill%2F)\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BMG-HHP-\nCRCad.jpg)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-\nconditions/coronavirus-resource-\ncenter/?utm_source=BMG&utm_medium=sidebarad&utm_campaign=CRC)\n\n#### Marketplace\n\n![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/avweb-aviation-search-\nbanner3.png)\n\n#### Featured Video\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/maxresdefault-1-324x235.jpg)![video](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/themes/Newspaper/images/icons/ico-video-\nlarge.png)](https://www.avweb.com/multimedia/best-of-the-web-f-a-18-carrier-\nrecovery/ \"Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier Recovery\")\n\n[Multimedia](https://www.avweb.com/topics/multimedia/)\n\n### [Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier\nRecovery](https://www.avweb.com/multimedia/best-of-the-web-f-a-18-carrier-\nrecovery/ \"Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier Recovery\")\n\n[Editorial Staff](https://www.avweb.com/author/estaff/) - April 5, 2020\n\nWhen Navy aircraft return to trap aboard a carrier in good weather, it's\ncalled a Case I operation.

ATC argues that the agency misevaluated proposals,\nfailed to engage in discussions, and unreasonably made award to AB.\n\nWe deny the protest.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe RFP contemplates the award, on a best-value tradeoff basis, of a fixed-\nprice contract to perform the solicited requirements for a 2-month phase-in\nperiod, a base year, and four 1-year option periods.[1]  RFP at 5-61.  Firms\nwere advised that proposals would be evaluated considering price, and several\nnon-price considerations.  The evaluation factors were:  technical capability\n(deemed most important and significantly more important than the remaining two\nfactors); risk (deemed second in importance) and price (deemed the least\nimportant, but of increasing importance as proposals were deemed relatively\nequal under the non-price factors).[2]  RFP at 128.  Firms also were advised\nthat the agency intended to make award based on initial proposals without\nconducting discussions, but the RFP reserved to the government the right to\nengage in discussions should they be determined to be in the government\u2019s best\ninterests.  _Id._   In terms of price, the RFP advised offerors that prices\nwould be evaluated for reasonableness, realism and balance.  _Id._ at 133-134.\n\nIn response to the solicitation, the agency received a number of proposals,\nincluding those of the protester and the awardee.  The agency evaluated the\nproposals and, as is pertinent to this decision, assigned the ATC proposal a\nrating of unacceptable/high risk under the human resources management\nsubfactor (the most important of the subfactors), and marginal/moderate risk\nratings under the remaining two subfactors.  Agency Report (AR), exh. 16,\nSource Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB) Report, at 13.  In assigning it these\nratings, the agency identified three deficiencies in the ATC proposal under\nthe human resources management subfactor, one deficiency under the information\ntechnology systems and approach subfactor, and a total of 16 weaknesses among\nthe three subfactors.  _Id._ at 13-24.\n\nIn comparison, the agency assigned acceptable/low risk ratings to the AB\nproposal under each of the three subfactors, identified no weaknesses or\ndeficiencies, and found that AB\u2019s proposal met the agency\u2019s requirements.\n_Id._ at 77-86.\n\nThe agency\u2019s evaluators concluded that, because of the number and severity of\ndeficiencies and weaknesses identified in the ATC proposal (along with a\nnumber of price concerns identified by the agency, but not relevant to this\ndecision), ATC\u2019s proposal would require a substantial rewrite, and would not\nbe included in any competitive range that might be established.  AR, exh. 16,\nSSEB Report, at 98.\n\nThese evaluation results were presented to the agency\u2019s source selection\nauthority.  After reviewing the evaluation findings, he determined to make\naward to AB on the basis of initial proposals, finding that the proposal\nrepresented the best value to the government, and concluding that, although\nATC proposed a total evaluated price that was approximately $10.3 million less\nthan AB\u2019s price,[3] it also proposed materially [deleted] personnel to perform\nthe requirement.  AR, exh. 18, SSDD, at 10.  After being advised of the\nagency\u2019s selection decision and requesting and receiving a debriefing, ATC\nfiled the instant protest with our Office.\n\nPROTEST\n\nATC makes several arguments relating to the agency\u2019s decision to award the\ncontract to AB relating principally to the ownership of the company and the\nnature of the joint agreement between the concerns comprising the AB joint\nventure.  ATC also argues that the agency abused its discretion in failing to\nhold discussions before awarding the contract.  In addition, ATC argues that\nthe agency misevaluated proposals in a number of ways.  We have considered all\nof ATC\u2019s allegations and find them to be without merit.  We discuss ATC\u2019s\nprincipal contentions below.\n\nOwnership of AB\n\nATC alleges that the agency erred in making award to AB because Avix, Inc.,\nthe managing joint venture concern, is owned by an individual that ATC\nmaintains is a federal employee.[4]  According to the protester, award to AB\nis improper because Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) \u00a7 3.601 precludes\nagencies from knowingly awarding a contract to a federal employee or to a\nbusiness owned by a federal employee.\n\nWe find no merit to this aspect of ATC\u2019s protest.  The record shows that the\nchief executive officer (president) of Avix, Inc. is a member of the Virginia\nAir National Guard.  In this connection, he submitted an affidavit during the\nprotest stating, among other things, that he retired from the federal Air\nNational Guard on July 1, 2016, and began limited, part-time duty in the\nVirginia Air National Guard on January 20, 2017.  Affidavit of Avix, Inc.\nOwner, at 1.  He further represents that he has not been mobilized or deployed\ninto the federal Air National Guard.  _Id._   The protester has offered no\nevidence to contradict or draw into question the Avix, Inc. president\u2019s\naffidavit.  We therefore conclude that he has accurately characterized his\nstatus.\n\nThat being the case, there is no basis for our Office to object to the\nagency\u2019s award of the contract to AB for the reason advanced by the protester.\nApplicable case law clearly establishes that an individual acting as a member\nof a state national guard is not a federal employee.  For example, in _Perpich\nv. Department of Defense_ , 496 U.S. 334 (1990), the Supreme Court expressly\nrecognized that:\n\nSince 1933 all persons who have enlisted in a State National Guard unit have\nsimultaneously enlisted in the National Guard of the United States.  In the\nlatter capacity they became a part of the Enlisted Reserve Corps of the Army\n[or in this case, the Air Force], _but unless and until ordered to active duty\nin the Army [or Air Force], they retained their status as members of a\nseparate State Guard unit._\n\n_Id._ at 345 (emphasis supplied).  _See_ _also_ _Clark v. United States_ , 322\nF3d. 1358, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (and cases cited therein), where the Court of\nAppeals for the Federal Circuit stated:\n\nWe understand _Perpich_ [the case quoted above] to stand for the proposition\nthat members of the National Guard only serve the federal military when they\nare formally called into the military service of the United States.  At all\nother times, National Guard members serve solely as members of the State\nmilitia under the command of a state governor.\n\nAccordingly, there is no basis for our Office to conclude that the president\nof Avix, Inc. is a federal employee as contemplated under FAR \u00a7 3.601.  It\nfollows that award to the firm was not objectionable for the reasons advanced\nby the protester.\n\nIn addition to our conclusion above, we point out as well that there is no\nevidence in the record to show that the president of Avix, Inc. had any\naffiliation whatsoever with the acquiring activity.  There also is no evidence\nto show that he participated in any way in defining the agency\u2019s requirements;\npreparing the solicitation; evaluating proposals; or participating in the\nsource selection decision.  We therefore deny this aspect of ATC\u2019s protest.\n\nAB\u2019s Compliance with Small Business Administration Requirements\n\nATC argues that AB will be unable to comply with the requirements of the Small\nBusiness Administration\u2019s (SBA) regulations concerning performance of the\ncontract as between joint venturers.  The protester points out that 13 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 125.18(b)(3), requires the managing joint venture partner (in this case\nAvix, Inc.) to perform at least 40 percent of the requirement.  ATC maintains\nthat Avix, Inc. is a small business with only one employee, and that the firm\ncannot perform at least 40 percent of the requirement.\n\nWe view this aspect of ATC\u2019s protest to be essentially identical to arguments\nmade in cases where there is a challenge to a small business offeror\u2019s\ncompliance with a solicitation\u2019s limitation on subcontracting clause in small\nbusiness set-aside acquisitions where there is a small business prime\ncontractor and a large business subcontractor.  In such cases, an agency\u2019s\njudgment as to whether a small business offeror will comply with the\nlimitations on subcontracting clause is a matter of responsibility, and the\ncontractor\u2019s actual compliance is a matter of contract administration.\nGeiler/Schrudde & Zimmerman, B-412219 et al., Jan. 7, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 16 at\n7.  Neither issue is one that our Office generally reviews.  4 C.F.R.\n\u00a721.5(a), (c).  An offeror need not affirmatively demonstrate compliance with\nthe subcontracting limitations in its proposal.  Express Med. Transporters,\nInc., B-412692, Apr. 20, 2016, 2016 CPD \u00b6 108 at 6.  Rather, compliance is\npresumed unless specifically negated by language in the proposal. _Id._\n\nHere, ATC has not identified any aspect of the AB proposal that should\nreasonably have led the agency to question whether AB would comply with the\nSBA requirements associated with performance of a contract by an SDVOSB joint\nventure.  On the contrary, our review of the record leads us to conclude that\nthe AB proposal gives every indication that, in fact, AB will meet those\nrequirements.  In this connection, the AB proposal provides as follows:\n\nOur Team has a long history of very successful contract transition efforts and\nthis Plan is further streamlined by the fact that two of the three ABJV Team\ncompanies comprise the incumbent contractor force.   _The main efforts will\ncenter on transitioning some of the existing employees to the ABJV prot\u00e9g\u00e9\ncompany, AVIX._  Since the formal Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship between AVIX and\nBGI includes assisting AVIX with the required HR [human resources] policies\nand procedures, this process will be seamless.  We expect to fill all required\npositions through retention of personnel selected from the current workforce.\n\nAR, exh. 15, AB Technical Proposal, at 34 (emphasis supplied).  In light of\nthese considerations, we deny this aspect of ATC\u2019s protest.\n\nDiscussions\n\nATC also argues that the agency acted unreasonably in making award on the\nbasis of initial proposals and should instead have engaged in discussions.\n\nWe have consistently stated that we generally will not review an agency\u2019s\ndecision whether or not to engage in discussions because there are no\nstatutory or regulatory criteria specifying when an agency should or should\nnot initiate discussions, nor is there any requirement for an agency to, for\nexample, document its decision not to engage in discussions.  Kiewit Louisiana\nCo., B-403736, Oct. 14, 2010, 2010 CPD \u00b6 243 at 3.  As noted, where, as here,\na solicitation advises offerors that an agency intends to make award on the\nbasis of initial proposals, the agency is under no obligation to engage in\ndiscussions, and properly may make award based on initial proposals.  Mare\nIsland Dry Dock, LLC, B-410821, Feb. 26, 2015, 2015 CPD \u00b6 100 at 5.  We\ntherefore deny this aspect of ATC\u2019s protest.\n\nEvaluation of Proposals\n\nFinally, ATC challenges the agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals.  ATC argues that\nthe agency applied unstated evaluation considerations in evaluating its\nproposal.  ATC also argues that, in evaluating its proposal compared to the AB\nproposal, the agency applied a more rigorous, unequal, standard.  In this\nlatter connection, ATC essentially argues that, had the agency applied the\nsame standard in evaluating its proposal that was used to evaluate the AB\nproposal, many of the weaknesses (and one of the deficiencies) assigned to its\nproposal would not have been assigned.\n\nIn reviewing protests concerning an agency\u2019s evaluation of proposals, we do\nnot independently review the proposals; rather, we review the record to ensure\nthat an agency\u2019s evaluation is reasonable and consistent with the terms of the\nsolicitation, as well as applicable statutes and regulations.  Intelligent\nDecisions, Inc., et al., B-409686 et al., July 15, 2014, 2014 CPD \u00b6 213 at\n15\u201316.\n\nThe RFP included a definition for the assignment of an unacceptable rating.\nThat definition provided that the agency would assign an unacceptable rating\nwhere the proposal does not meet the requirements of the solicitation and,\nthus, contains one or more deficiencies and is \u201cunawardable.\u201d  RFP at 129.  As\nnoted above, the agency assigned the ATC proposal four deficiencies, any one\nof which, pursuant to the terms of the RFP, would provide a basis for\nrejecting the proposal.\n\nOne of the deficiencies identified by the agency in the ATC proposal under the\nmost important subfactor, human resource management, related to the firm\u2019s own\ncalculation of its required full-time equivalent personnel.  In particular,\nthe agency found that ATC had materially understated the manning necessary to\nperform the requirements at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base using ATC\u2019s own basis\nfor calculating a full-time equivalent.  AR, exh. 16, SSEB Report, at 14.\n\nIn its initial protest, ATC claimed that this deficiency arose because of an\nambiguity in the solicitation, and argued that it easily could have remedied\nthis deficiency had the agency conducted discussions.  In its comments\nresponding to the agency report--which provided a detailed response to ATC\u2019s\nargument--ATC made no further mention of this argument.  We therefore take as\ngiven that ATC concedes this deficiency was appropriately assigned; we also\ndeem as abandoned ATC\u2019s original challenge to the terms of the RFP, as well as\nits challenge to the assignment of the deficiency.  _Yang Enterprises, Inc._ ,\nB-415923, Mar. 12, 2018, 2018 CPD \u00b6 109.  In any event, ATC has not shown that\nthe agency acted erroneously or unreasonably in assigning the deficiency;\nATC\u2019s proposal does, in fact, reflect the problem identified by the agency in\nthe firm\u2019s calculation of its proposed staffing.  The record therefore shows\nthat there was at least one deficiency properly identified in the ATC\nproposal, and that deficiency rendered its proposal ineligible for award.\n\nWith respect to ATC\u2019s remaining evaluation challenges, we need not consider\nthem in any detail.  None of ATC\u2019s evaluation arguments relating to AB allege\nthat the awardee should have been found technically unacceptable; rather, all\nof its remaining arguments allege that the agency erred in finding ATC\u2019s\nproposal unacceptable.[5]  Since the record shows that the ATC proposal was\nproperly and reasonably found technically unacceptable for the reasons\ndiscussed above, it follows that, even if ATC were correct with respect to its\nremaining arguments, it was not competitively prejudiced by any of the\nremaining alleged evaluation errors.  Inasmuch as competitive prejudice is an\nessential element of any viable protest, even if ATC were correct in its\nremaining arguments, we still would find no basis to sustain its protest.\nGeneral Dynamics Information Technology, Inc., B-414387, B-414387.2, May 30,\n2017, 2017 CPD \u00b6 176 at 8.\n\nThe protest is denied.\n\nThomas H. Armstrong  \nGeneral Counsel\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n[1] The solicitation was set aside for service-disabled veteran-owned small\nbusinesses (SDVOSB).\n\n[2] The technical capability factor included three subfactors (human resource\nmanagement, which was deemed significantly more important than the other two\nsubfactors of organizational and functional management, and information\ntechnology approach and management, which each were deemed equal in\nimportance).  In addition to the subfactors, the RFP included a number of\n\u201caspects\u201d under each subfactor.  RFP at 129-132.  The RFP provided that, in\nevaluating proposals, the agency would assign adjectival ratings at the\nsubfactor level only, and that ratings of outstanding, good, acceptable,\nmarginal or unacceptable would be assigned.  _Id._ at 129.\n\nSeparately, the RFP advised offerors that the agency also would assign a risk\nrating to the proposals under each subfactor of low, moderate, high or\nunacceptable.  RFP at 132-133.\n\n[3] ATC\u2019s total evaluated price was $39,487,077, compared to AB\u2019s total\nevaluated price of $49,795,376.  AR, exh. 17, Initial Evaluation Brief, at\n342; exh. 18, Source Selection Decision Document (SSDD), at 10.\n\n[4] AB is an all-small-business mentor prot\u00e9g\u00e9 joint venture comprised of\nAvix, Inc.--the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 small business--and BGI, LLC, the small-business\nmentor concern.  As described in the firm\u2019s proposal:\n\nThe JV [joint venture] is organized under the Small Business Administration\u2019s\n(SBA) Small Business Program as set forth in 13 C.F.R. \u00a7 125.8 and \u00a7 125.9.\nThe SBA has approved an All Small Mentor Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program (ASMPP) agreement\nbetween BGI (as Mentor) and AVIX (as Prot\u00e9g\u00e9) effective 13 March 2018.\n\nAR, exh. 15, AB Technical Proposal, at 9.\n\n[5] With respect to its initial protest relating to the deficiency described\nabove, ATC argued that the AB proposal should also have been found technically\nunacceptable because of the extent to which Avix, Inc. was relying on its\njoint venture teaming partner.  ATC made no further mention of this aspect of\nits initial protest in its comments, and thus abandoned it.  _Yang\nEnterprises, Inc._ _supra_.  In any case, as discussed above, this essentially\nis no more than an argument that AB will not comply with the requirements of\nthe SBA\u2019s regulations relating to performance of the contract as an all-small\nmentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 joint venture, a matter not for our consideration in these\ncircumstances.\n\n## [Find Recent Legal Decisions  \u00bb](/legal/index.html)\n\n## [Explore Related Legal Resources  \u00bb](/legal/index.html)\n\n### Apr 7, 2020\n\n  * [RIVA Solutions, Inc.](/products/B-418408)   \nThe protest is denied.  \n\nB-418408\n\n  * [Oready, LLC--Costs](/products/B-418297.2)   \nWe deny the request.  \n\nB-418297.2\n\n  * [Pond Constructors, Inc.](/products/B-418403)   \nWe deny the protest.  \n\nB-418403\n\n  * [Appian Corporation](/products/B-417837.2)   \nWe dismiss the protest.  \n\nB-417837.2\n\n### Apr 3, 2020\n\n  * [General Dynamics Information Technology, Inc.](/products/B-417616.2,B-417616.3,B-417616.4)   \nWe dismiss the protest in part and deny the protest in part.  \n\nB-417616.2,B-417616.3,B-417616.4\n\n  * [InGenesis, Inc.](/products/B-416564.3)   \nWe deny the protest.  \n\nB-416564.3\n\n### Apr 1, 2020\n\n  * [Zero Waste Solutions, Inc.](/products/B-418550)   \nWe dismiss the protest.  \n\nB-418550\n\n  * [Social Security Administration: Removing Inability To Communicate in English as an Education Category](/products/B-331915)   \n\nB-331915\n\n  * [Environmental Protection Agency: Repeal of the Clean Power Plan; Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Existing Electric Utility Generating Units; Revisions to Emission Guidelines Implementing Regulations](/products/B-331799)   \n\nB-331799\n\n  * [National Labor Relations Board: Joint Employer Status Under the National Labor Relations Act](/products/B-331913)   \n\nB-331913\n\nLooking for more?

is\nreporting](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-28/boeing-s-737-max-\nsoftware-outsourced-to-9-an-hour-\nengineers?fbclid=IwAR24fsVXBsAA1ncKOEFt-Q8mdUgn41C_XhjoDX_E_0S98BiDv4UP3p_MTFA)\nthat Boeing outsourced coding of software on the Boeing 737 MAX to engineers\nwho were paid as little as $9 an hour. The company and some of its suppliers\nlaid off their own engineers in favor of subcontracting coding work to\noffshore companies in a cost-saving move that may not have saved money,\naccording to a former Boeing software engineer. \u201cIt was controversial because\nit was far less efficient than Boeing engineers just writing the code,\u201d Mark\nRabin, who worked on the MAX flight test group, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\n[frequently] took many rounds going back and forth because the code was not\ndone correctly.\u201d\n\nThe subcontractors, many of whom worked for India-based HCL Technologies, did\nnot work on software for the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System\n(MCAS) that is the focus of the worldwide grounding of the type but did\ndevelop software for flight displays. Another Indian company did software for\nflight test equipment. Boeing officials said the offshore companies also were\nnot involved with the software glitch that was discovered last week during FAA\ntesting and will further delay the aircraft\u2019s return to service.  \n\n#### Other AVwebflash Articles\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dallas-\nap-100x70.jpg)](https://www.avweb.com/flight-safety/10-dead-in-texas-king-air-\ncrash/ \"10 Dead In Texas King Air Crash \\(Updated\\)\")\n\n### [10 Dead In Texas King Air Crash (Updated)](https://www.avweb.com/flight-\nsafety/10-dead-in-texas-king-air-crash/ \"10 Dead In Texas King Air Crash\n\\(Updated\\)\")\n\n[Accidents/NTSB](https://www.avweb.com/topics/flight-safety/accidents-ntsb/)\nJune 30, 2019\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/300px-\nErco_F-1_Ercoupe_CF-\nNLX_02-100x70.jpeg)](https://www.avweb.com/insider/rudders-we-dont-need-no-\nstinkin-rudders/ \"Rudders?

First, they moved from Seattle,\nwhere the planes were designed and made, to Chicago, which is anti-aviation.\nThen, they downgraded input from their flight test people in the design of the\n8737 MAX. DUMB, DUMB, DUMB!\n\nIIRC, their IT engineering staff cannot touch the computer code (closed-shop\nIT), further separating design from product.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fboeing-\noutsourced-coding-for-9-an-hour%2F)\n\n  4. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6a9ef188f6fe9c1d49df4b943a5eb6af?s=50&d=mm&r=g) .

July 1, 2019 at 7:47 pm\n\nIn the olden days of 20 years ago, I was also a paid contractor, writing code\nfor the DoD. My rate was rather spectacular compared to $9/hour, then the tech\nstock crash, and influx of Indian coding houses, crashed the pay scale. The\nIndians were nice people, but they didn't understand what was actually needed,\nonly that coding was required; quantity spoke more than quality. I exited the\nindustry.  \nThen five years ago, the aerospace company to which I provide services farmed\nout their help desk to a low-cost Indian firm. The complaints were so loud and\ndownright vicious (typically, that once the \"helpers\" were off-script, they\nwere essentially useless) that they went the other direction, and have on-site\nconcierge stations, where one might drop by with their engineering laptop to\nconsult face-to-face. This aerospace company does NOT farm out the FADEC\ncoding; I also highly doubt that Boeing farmed out the most critical parts.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fboeing-\noutsourced-coding-for-9-an-hour%2F)\n\n  8. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c2df150d5311601db40d47194de0f7c1?s=50&d=mm&r=g) James F. July 2, 2019 at 1:01 pm\n\nI think it's easy to put the blame on the $9/hr coders as it conveniently\naccomplishes two objectives: first, it emphasizes that highly trained and\nhighly paid American programmers (I hate the term \"coder\") are losing jobs to\nthe lowest bidders overseas, which is a point well-taken, but not really\nrelevant to the situation; second, it subtly shifts blame from Boeing systems\nengineering and testing to foreigners who just \"don't get it\" when it comes to\nrunning development programs with that highly vaunted American Exceptionalism.\nI have run several software development programs and was pretty-much forced to\nuse outsourced programmers in India. As a previous commenter wrote, they are\nnice people and do a reasonable job, but there are problems when it comes to\ngetting the results from them that you really want. And this is the core\nissue. The real problem with software development is specifying what you want\nin the first place, and that is not the job of the programmers. The\nresponsibility lies in the managers and systems engineers who will be\nincorporating that software and firmware into the final product. The error\nhere is one of specification and testing, which is squarely the responsibility\nof Boeing - plain and simple. You get from programmers what you ask from them,\nwhether they work in this country or halfway across the globe.  \nThe main missing specification from the MCAS software is to above all maintain\nthe safety of the passengers in the aircraft, not to just prevent the plane\nfrom stalling (which it did, by the way). The implicit specification of this\nsoftware seemed to be cover up for the fact that the basic aerodynamic changes\ndue to the larger engines can cause a positive feedback loop to occur at high\nangles of attack that can result in the plane doing a backflip. This is the\nsame situation that Volkswagen found themselves in when it was discovered\ntheir diesel cars were programmed to cheat on their emissions tests.  \nDon't blame the programmers, blame those in charge.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fboeing-\noutsourced-coding-for-9-an-hour%2F)\n\n  9. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/df57ce849ed7da50daa6df875bfe7030?s=50&d=mm&r=g) John P.

When you pay $9 for\n\"coding\" what you get is an awful lot of copy and pasting.  \nMost of the \"coders\" working at that rate have limited experience and have\nbeen taught how to make flashy project web pages and the like by copying what\nworks, pasting it, and then putting a little gloss on it.  \nMistakes in the original are replicated in the copy (including security\nlapses, openings to Google etc).  \nNow, there is one civilian air liner maker which wrote a lot of the first code\nused: Airbus.  \nAnd sooner or later, these $9 coders are going to copy code that works from it\nand paste it into Boeing's projects -- it is inevitable because it is how they\nwork for $9 an hour.  \nAnd how do you think Airbus will react when it discovers that?\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fboeing-\noutsourced-coding-for-9-an-hour%2F)\n\n  10. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d17422d313a5cc50879330c6fb2d4dfb?s=50&d=mm&r=g) t i.

Wherein, 37% would be working with completely new and upgraded skill\nsets as required for the job profile. This has triggered the urge to\nupskilling the existing and prospective workforces. Responding to the\nrequirement, the IT sector in India is gearing up to acquire upgraded\ncognizance and to reskill employees to make them future-ready in thriving\ndomains of the cloud system, analytics, AI and other software development.\n\nThe government has launched a NASSCOM future skills platform to keep pace with\nmodern innovations and technology. This platform will evolve in partnership\nwith various sectors to create courseware for reskilling workforces. The\nobjective of this initiative is to re-skill 1 million professionals and 1\nmillion prospective personnel to penetrate the needed push of flexibility,\ninnovation, and adaptation in professionals.\n\nCorporate leaders in collaboration with the technology industry are harnessing\nthe disruption of technology to transform the workplaces to reinforce a data-\ndriven approach to long-term erudition and smart upskilling.\n\nThis post further talks about how re-skilling and upskilling improves the\nskill set of current and future employees:\n\n **Promotes an incessant learning culture**\n\nUp-skilling not only empowers role-centric proficiency, it rather grooms their\nsoft skills like communication, behaviour and personality development. Such\nskills bring a positive transformation in the professional temperaments of\nemployees and prepare them to take up new roles involving those who currently\ndon\u2019t have existence.\n\nFor example, a good apprehension of foreign languages and cultural diversity\nis required to hone soft skills contributing to an effective communication\nprocess. Upskilling employees with these attributes may assist employees to\ngrab progressive job opportunities on an international level.\n\nApart from communication skills, the up-skilling of behaviour and mannerism is\nalso very crucial. Employees should be trained enough to analyse the\ncriticality of the situation and respond accordingly. They must know how to\nhandle adversities and pressure while keeping calm and prudent. Such mannerism\nmakes them eligible for a future work environment.\n\nWorld Economic Forum in its report reveals that a minimum of 133 million\nupcoming job roles will be introduced by 2022, as an outcome of innovative\nlabour division between humans and technology algorithms.\n\nThis finding has accelerated the demand amongst corporates to hire skilled\nworkers for a successful organizational set-up. The digital and technical\nskill gap in employees is drastically unbalancing the demand and supply of\nupskilled talent. Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and other emerging\ntechnologies are ruling the entire industry and would continue to dominate the\nfuture work environment as well, creating a desperate need to upgrade the\ntechnical skills of employees. They would master the art of creative thinking,\nlogical reasoning and problem solving by honing such skills which are the\ncrucial demands of the futures market.\n\n **Job transition pathways**\n\nJob profiles and responsibilities are likely to be transformed with the advent\nof technology and innovation. Most job profiles existing today like Testers,\nSamplers, Inspectors and more may witness automation and transform into\nQuality Analysts. Front desk officers and administrative assistants may turn\nto be Meeting and Event Planners. Accessing viable and aspirational job roles\nrequire re-skilling to fit-in good.\n\nImagining beyond current roles and responsibilities is extremely important to\nsustain in the evolving corporate market. Industry leaders have acknowledged\nthis need of the hour and have proactively incorporated skill upgrading\nmodules into their working schedules. Employees are being educated to hone\ntheir cognitive and managerial skills by Learning and Development\nprofessionals. This vision equips employees and employers to work with each\nother for the long term while meeting the pace of technology and future\ndemands. Moreover, it will open a wider path for both the entities to choose\nnew options for growth and success.\n\n **Step out of comfort zone**\n\nCorporate will go beyond their conventional employee training models and will\nfollow up-to-date approach to educate staff members for a prompt and better\nupskilling. However, employees need to be proactive and more responsible to\nbecome self-directed apprentices. As theoretical knowledge is not enough, in-\nhouse upskilling lets employees access their learnings on the job. This\nassists them to explore the flaws and points of improvement then and there for\neffective learning and hence, creating an environment of mutually benefited\nexistence. The entire process aims to step individuals and corporates to step\nout of their comfort zone and expand their imagination.\n\nIn the long-term scenario, the key formula of a successful organization will\nbe enhancing individual mobility, workplace optimization, continuous skill\nupgrading and freedom of creativity.

Each\nindustrial revolution has witnessed some form of disruption, right from the\nharnessing of steam as a power source to the dawn of information technology.\nThe next wave of disruption is here \u2013 powered by automation and geared by\nartificial intelligence. As the drumbeats of technological advancements\ncoupled with digitization grow larger, firms will need to develop strategies\nto survive this new era.\n\nAs firms are turning increasing competitive while vying for talent, there is\nno dearth of opportunities for the new generation of professionals. However,\nthe manufacturing sector is not always viewed as the most lucrative career\navenue by millennials. The memories of mass lay-offs from yesteryears have\ntarnished the image of manufacturing as a platform to kick-start careers for\nmany. This has led to a growing gap between the available and the desired\nskills required in the current competitive market. The biggest challenge for\nmanufacturing organizations in this era of digital transformation isn\u2019t\ntechnology, it\u2019s people. It is imperative for leaders across organizations to\ncomprehend the importance of this part of the equation while revisiting and\nrevamping their corporate strategies to survive this wave of change. A single\ncookie-cutter solution is not available to address these challenges. The\nprimary aim at this point is to get ahead and conceptualize, develop and\nimplement policies, systems, and processes by looking through the lens of a\nnew set of conditions and circumstances.\n\nTechnological developments are not only expanding the skill gap by increasing\nthe demand for new skills, but it is also shortening the shelf life of\nexisting skills. There also arises the need for investment in continuous\nlearning and development within organizations. Adding to this complexity are\nthe demographic changes across the globe that will proliferate the challenge\nof finding and retaining the workforce for tomorrow. Despite these aggressive\nchallenges, only a few companies have dipped their toes into these new waters\nand implemented forward-thinking strategies. Companies are trying to stretch\ntheir horizons to stay ahead of this shockwave.\n\nTalent search in the manufacturing industry is going to be revolutionized in\nthe next five years, with these trends to gain prominence in the coming days.\n\n **Proactive hiring strategies using AI**\n\nArtificial intelligence will definitely make the process of hiring more\ntransparent and efficient. Manufacturing firms will collaborate with digital\nservice providers to accelerate the process of acquiring talent proactively\nwith creative solutions to bridge talent gaps including hiring people who are\nnot necessarily prepared for a career in manufacturing but are tech-savvy and\ncould prove to be an asset for the company.\n\n **Attracting people with STEM background**\n\nToday, the manufacturing industry is in dire need of quality human capital\nmore than ever before to cater to the challenges brought on by globalization,\ntech innovation, and automation. To support these advancements, manufacturers\nwill attract talent with STEM (science, technology, engineering, and\nmathematics) skills that would help bridge the skill gap. The demand for these\nskill sets is rising in other sectors as well and since the manufacturing\nsector is not always seen as the ideal launch pad by young professionals,\nagile organizations will expand their talent search by doing outreach programs\nwith undergrad and grad schools. By connecting with students while they are\nstill in school, organizations can aid in changing the perception of\nmanufacturing among these young minds.\n\n**Effective Knowledge Management**\n\nEmerging economies like India have developed skill challenges with the rapid\ngrowth of the young population. The loss of experienced and seasoned workers\nwill reshape the foundation of many industrial organizations as it also\nincludes loss of intellectual capital and institutional knowledge. Firms will\nfind innovative and seamless ways to ensure a smooth transition from one\ngeneration to another. The people function teams in organizations will partner\nwith the line managers to address this challenge and nip it in bud by\ndesigning and implementing smart and effective knowledge management policies\nincluding the maintenance of knowledge repositories, cross-generational\nmentorship programs, and on-the-job training modules.\n\n **Investment in Continuous Learning**\n\nThe whole wave of digital transformation in companies will require\nconsiderable investment in people in terms of learning and development. By\nproviding access to learning opportunities, incumbent workers will prove adept\nat integrating new technologies relevant to them and this will enable\ncompanies to adopt the emerging trends globally without missing a beat. While\nassessing new hires, the talent acquisition specialists will not only consider\nthe current skills but also the ability to learn and evolve in today\u2019s fast-\nchanging environments. Investments in internship programs will increase to\ninfuse new mindsets into the system, train them for particular skills and\nintroduce them to the company culture.\n\n **Focus on Employee Value Proposition**\n\nCorporate cultures cannot be overhauled in one night. With the war for talent\ngrowing fiercer, employer branding \u2013 focusing on employee experience and\nengagement \u2013 has become crucial. Companies will compete for smart resources\nwith their brand repertoire. Hence, people partners in organizations will work\nwith the senior leadership to re-evaluate their employee value propositions to\nattract and retain the most skilled and educated workers before the next wave\nof hiring hits.\n\n **Workforce Analytics**\n\nWith the emergence of big data and people analytics, measuring metrics such as\nproductivity, efficiency, etc. will become far more convenient. With the aid\nof data and analytics, people functions will analyze and assess the talent\ngaps by comparing workforce needs versus the existing skill sets.\n\nWith the digitization of everything and the next-gen genomics at the doorstep,\nthe road ahead is bogged with challenges. In order to survive and sustain,\norganizations need to adopt a \u2018fail-fast\u2019 and \u2018succeed-faster mentality\u2019,\nwhich will expose them to a faster learning curve and steer them towards the\npath of success.\n\nDisclaimer: _The views expressed in the article above are those of the\nauthors' and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of this\npublishing house_\n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n[people](/tags/people-6431/) [manufacturing sector](/tags/manufacturing-\nsector-11769/) [disruption](/tags/disruption-53977/)\n[career](/tags/career-7120/) [millennials](/tags/millennials-18323/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

This evolution\nstarted with user experience science, and further evolved into creating\npositive customer experiences. In L&D, this shift is taking shape in the move\nto create a complete and effective learner experiences.\n\nThe learner experience refers to any course, program, or other interaction\nwhere learning takes place. It can occur in academic or business settings, and\ncan include traditional (face-to-face classroom) and nontraditional (online,\nsocial, and mobile) interactions. Please note use of the word _learner,_ not\n_learning._ For modern learning to be effective, designers and facilitators\nneed to pay attention to each learner, designing for individual needs and\ninteractions. This means the main emphasis of instructional design is on the\nhuman, not the learning content or curriculum. The key is that the learner\nexperience design incorporates the learners\u2019 needs, reactions, thoughts, and\nattitudes.\n\nNo doubt, the \u201clearner experience\u201d will occur anyway. Our objective, as L&D\nprofessionals, is to make that experience a positive, planned experience with\nan impact and outcomes that last longer than the duration of training.  \n\n## Enter Active Deep Learning\n\nActive learning is experiential, mindful, and engaging. It is a process\nwhereby learners engage in activities\u2014such as reading, discussion, or role\nplay\u2014with the goal of promoting the analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of\nlearning content. It is cooperative and problem-based learning.\n\nUnfortunately, for some designers, active learning translates simply to the\naddition of a few educational games and incorporating movement within the\ntraining room, without real purpose. Some sessions turn out to be superficial,\nforgetting to balance activity with the other factor of the equation: depth.\n\nIn other words, it is not enough for the learning to be active. Learning has\nto be active AND deep. Deep learning includes following tenets of brain-based\nlearning, metacognition, reflective learning, and so forth. It relies heavily\non motivation, which is intrinsic, socially rooted, and promotes autonomy and\nself-esteem. Bottom line: depth is the gap that designers need to bridge.  \n\n## Create a Complete Journey\n\nLearner experience design considers all the potential touch points L&D has\nwith the learner. A full experience cannot be passive or centered on a one-\ntime event; it needs to be a journey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe learning journey as a whole requires its own designed experience and\nobjectives. The depth and experience of the journey should vary according to\nthe length of the engagement and the desired learning outcomes. The point for\ndevelopers is that this journey starts before the training event (with\nreadiness activities) and continues after the event (with practice, follow up,\nand coaching or mentoring).\n\nThe learning trip, however, is the actual training event\u2014when learners are in\ndirect contact with the facilitator or courseware. A learning journey could\ncontain more than one trip, depending on the complexity of learning outcomes\nand length of the journey.\n\nMeanwhile, each trip is comprised of a certain number of adventures. Each\nadventure represents an individual learning activity, and each activity is a\ncomplete unit by itself. To be a true adventure, the learner needs to fully\nengage with the activity. Consequently, each adventure needs elements of\nexploration, suspense, observation, and learning. This is why it is called\n\u201cexperiential learning\u201d\u2014learners explore and deeply reflect so they can build\non new ideas.\n\nKeep in mind: even though each of the three elements\u2014journey, trip,\nadventure\u2014of the learning experience is distinctly designed, they also are\nfully connected to each other. In fact, adventures (activities) and trips\n(training events and courseware) must integrate and work together to create a\ntotal journey (learner experience)\u2014and for learning transfer to transpire.  \n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Design Maps Show the Way\n\nConnecting the worlds of art and science, learner experience design brings\ntogether numerous disciplines. In addition to traditional learning and\ncognitive sciences, design thinking plays a critical role. To equip learning\ndevelopers with the design thinking mindset and methodologies, I suggest using\ndesign maps. In fact, design mapping is a core foundation in many design\ndisciplines.\n\nAt SeGa Group, we follow the First Framework for creating the learner\nexperience design map. The framework is comprised of four individual maps that\nenable developers to view the experience design from multiple layers. This\nhelps them get a holistic picture of the flow and integration of all elements\nof the learning journey, allowing them to structure ideas and content to\nindividual touchpoints and pay close attention to learner\u2019s emotional,\nbehavioral, and cognitive status. Here are the four maps our designers use:  \n\n  * **Holistic Design Map.** This is concerned with the context of learners and outcomes of the design. In other words, what experience should the learners encounter in order to achieve desired outcomes? It considers who the learners are, how the design empathizes with them, and any necessary actions. \n\n  * **Learner Journey Map.** This is concerned with the overall learner journey and takes into account all of the interactions and touchpoints with the learner. It also defines the learning outcomes for each phase\u2014before, during, and after learning.\n\n  * **Trip Design Map.** The trip map is concerned with the genuine engagement of the learner. It provides sequencing for content and interaction, and considers the learners\u2019 statuses during each activity. \n\n  * **Adventure Design Map.** This is concerned with mapping out individual learning activities. This map designs each activity as its own experience, and it monitors the status of the learner before and after each adventure (status-in/status-out), aligning each activity and status to the desired learning outcomes.\n\nThese design maps have proven efficiency with different designers in various\nlearning design contexts. They help developers evolve their traditional\nperspective and dive into the deep details of a learning program, ensuring\nmultiple opportunities for learner engagement and guaranteeing deep,\nsustainable transfer of learning.  \n\n## Want to Learn More?\n\nJoin me at the ATD 2018 International Conference & EXPO for the session: [LXD\n(Learner eXperience Design): Using Design Maps for Active, Deep Learner\nExperiences](https://atd2018.mapyourshow.com/7_0/sessions/session-\ndetails.cfm?ScheduleID=167).

One way in which the organization furthers its mission is to provide\nvendor-neutral Linux certifications to IT professionals around the globe. With\n\"more than 500,000 exams delivered\" to candidates and 400 training partners,\nLPI stakes a claim as \"the world's first and largest vendor-neutral Linux and\nopen source certification body\" (LPI [Our Purpose\npage](http://www.lpi.org/about-lpi/our-purpose)).\n\nWith input from private industry, academia and individuals, Linux experts\nprovide input on exam questions to ensure that they're rigorous, accurate and\napply to any standard Linux system.\n\n## LPI Certification Program Overview\n\nThe LPI certification program is simple. It includes three certifications that\nbuild on one another:\n\n  * LPIC-1: Linux Administrator -- Entry-level certification that recognizes individuals who can install and configure a workstation running Linux, maintain the system from the command line and configure a basic network\n  * LPIC-2: Linux Engineer -- Mid-level certification designed for professionals who administer small- to medium-sized mixed networks\n  * LPIC-3: Linux Enterprise Professional -- Senior-level certification that identifies Linux professionals who plan, conceptualize, design, implement and troubleshoot Linux installations in enterprise environments\n\nEach LPIC certification requires you to pass one or two multiple-choice exams,\neach of which costs $188 and all of which are administered by [Pearson\nVUE](http://pearsonvue.com/lpi/). All LPIC certifications are valid for five\nyears.\n\nIn addition, LPI offers two other credentials. First, those just starting with\nLinux may find the Linux Essentials certification a good foundation before\njumping into the more advanced LPIC certifications. Second, the LPI DevOps\nTools Engineer credential offers those interested in DevOp topics and tools an\nopportunity to establish and burnish such skills in Linux-based environments.\nBoth of these certs are covered the sections that follow details on LPIC-1,\n-2, and -3 below.\n\n## LPIC-1: Linux Administrator\n\nIn the LPI certification program, the [LPIC-1: Linux\nAdministrator](http://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/lpic-1-overview) is\nconsidered a junior-level Linux certification that requires you to pass two\nexams: 101-400 and 102-400. There are no prerequisites.\n\nThe LPIC-1 101-400 exam covers system architecture, the nuts and bolts of\nLinux installation, basic package management, GNU and Unix commands, devices\nand file systems.\n\nThe LPIC-1 102-400 exam tests you on customizing the shell environment,\nwriting and running scripts, and managing databases and running SQL commands.\nYou must also know how to configure settings for user interfaces and the\ndesktop, perform administrative tasks and manage system services, create\nnetwork connections and secure Linux systems.\n\n## LPI Partner Certifications\n\nLPI and CompTIA have a 2-in-1 Linux certification program, which lets\ncandidates acquire LPIC-1 certification after achieving the [CompTIA Linux+\nPowered by LPI](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/linux). (This\nprogram formerly included the SUSE Certified Linux Administrator (CLA)\ncertification - a 3-in-1 offer - but the third leg of that tripod expired in\n2016.)\n\nYou must first get an LPI ID by registering at the LPI website. Next, take the\nCompTIA Linux+ Powered by LPI exams and indicate that you want your exam\nscores sent to LPI upon successful completion. You'll soon receive\nnotification of your LPIC-1 certification from LPI.\n\n## LPIC-2: Linux Engineer\n\nThe [LPIC-2: Linux Engineer](http://www.lpi.org/our-\ncertifications/lpic-2-overview) is an advanced-level Linux credential that\nrequires a current LPIC-1 certification as a prerequisite. To achieve the\nLPIC-2, you must pass exams 201-450 and 202-450:\n\nThe LPIC-2 201-450 exam dives into capacity planning, manipulating the Linux\nkernel, configuring system startup services and boot loaders, and configuring\nand maintaining file systems and devices. You will also be tested on advanced\nstorage device administration, networking configuration and system\nmaintenance.\n\nThe LPIC-2 202-450 exam focuses mainly on networking-related topics, such as\nDomain Name Server (DNS), web services, file sharing, network client\nmanagement, e-mail services and router configuration. The exam also covers\nsecurity topics like secure shell (SSH), port testing and configuring OpenVPN.\n\n## LPIC-3: Linux Enterprise Professional\n\nThe LPIC-3: Linux Enterprise Professional is the pinnacle of the LPI\ncertification program and is considered expert level. Therefore, you should\nhave several years of hands-on experience installing, managing, integrating,\nnetworking and troubleshooting Linux in an enterprise environment.\n\nTo earn your LPIC-3 credential, you must achieve LPIC-2 certification as a\nprerequisite and pass one of these 300-series exams:\n\n[Mixed Environment](http://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/lpic-3-300-overview)\n(exam 300): This exam focuses on OpenLDAP configuration, OpenLDAP as an\nauthentication backend, and highly advanced levels of Samba administration,\namong other topics.\n\n[Security](http://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/lpic-3-303-overview) (exam\n303): To pursue this exam, be sure you're well versed in access controls and\ncryptography, as well as application, operations and network security.\n\n[Virtualization and High Availability](http://www.lpi.org/our-\ncertifications/lpic-3-304-overview) (exam 304): This exam covers\nvirtualization (of course), along with load balancing, cluster management and\ncluster storage.\n\nYou can take the LPIC-2 exams and an LPIC-3 exam in any order. That means you\ncan knock out the LPIC-3 exam of your choice, then circle back and sit for the\nLPIC-2 exams.\n\n## LPI Linux Essentials\n\nThe [Linux Essentials](http://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/linux-essentials-\noverview) Professional Development Certificate (PDC) is LPI's entry-level\ncertification. It doesn't serve as a prerequisite for the LPIC-1, but it's a\ngreat way for people who are relatively new to Linux to begin validating their\nskills. The certificate is beneficial for many different industry\nprofessionals, from developers, to administrators and engineers, and data\nanalysts. By studying for and taking the exam, you also gain certification\nprep experience, which will be a benefit if you choose to pursue other LPIC\ncerts.\n\nAchieving the Linux Essentials PDC indicates you are familiar with open source\napplications versus closed source, know the basics of the Linux operating\nsystem, and can run commands on the command line, manage files, perform backup\nand restore operations and write basic scripts.\n\nPassing a single exam (LPI 010-150) is required to earn the certificate, which\ndoesn't expire. By today's standards, the fee is quite affordable, coming in\nat a mere $110, making it attractive to those interested in exploring Linux\ncertifications.\n\n## LPI DevOps Tools Engineer\n\nThe [Linux Professional Institute DevOps Tools\nEngineer](http://www.lpi.org/our-certifications/lpic-ot-devops-overview)\ncredential verifies the skills necessary to use tools to enable and enhance\ncollaboration in workflows through the software development and systems\nadministration lifecycle. To create this new credential (introduced in late\n2017), LPI surveyed the DevOps \"tools landscape\" to define what they call \"a\nset of essential tools when applying DevOps.\" This means that the exam zeroes\nin on practical, day-to-day DevOps skills at the nexus of operations and\ndevelopment.\n\nCandidates should possess working knowledge of DevOps domain including\ncontainer and machine deployment, software engineering and architecture,\nconfiguration management and monitoring. They should also be proficient in\nsuch free and open source utilities as Ansible, Docker, Git, Jenkins, Puppet\nand Vagrant.\n\nPassing a single exam (LPI 701-100) is required to earn the certification\nwhich, like other LPI credentials, lasts 5 years. This 90-minute exam includes\n60 multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions, and costs $200.\n\n## Related Jobs and Training Resources\n\nConsidering the focus of LPI Linux certifications, the vast majority of\nrelated positions are along the lines of system administrators, network\nadministrators, system engineers and technical support specialist. But you\nwill occasionally stumble across job listings seeking LPI certification for\ncloud administrator, cybersecurity engineer and technical education\nspecialist.\n\nSome positions specifically look for Linux engineers with programming skills.\nFor example, one employer was looking for Puppet/Linux engineers to streamline\nPuppet workflow and assist with implementation and post-implementation\nsupport. Another position called for an operating systems programmer who can\ndesign, develop and implement new system tools, and write scripts in BASH and\nPython or other administrative scripting languages.\n\nLinux certification courses are available through many channels, although LPI\nrecommends that you take courses through one of its approved training partners\n(see the [Partner Search](http://cs.lpi.org/caf/Xamman/partner) page for more\ndetails). The [LPI Certification Marketplace](http://www.lpimarketplace.com/)\nis an online store chock-full of Linux references, certification study guides,\npractice exams, courseware, video training and practice labs.\n\n![](https://img.business.com/w/80/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2ltYWdlcy9hdXRob3IvNWE1LzY0MTQ3MTAzOWViMTYxYzhiNDViOC80MDAtNDAw)\n\nEd Tittel\n\n    \n\nEd is a 30-year-plus veteran of the computing industry, who has worked as a\nprogrammer, a technical manager, a classroom instructor, a network consultant\nand a technical evangelist for companies that include Burroughs, Schlumberger,\nNovell, IBM/Tivoli and NetQoS.

At present, they are focused on non-technical fields such as\nthose of leadership, customer service, and time management.

Government's announcements related\nto the development of emerging technologies like AI, ML, Data Analytics\necosystem in the country and skilling opportunities for the youth, clearly\nreflect the focus on preparing the youth for jobs of tomorrow. Also, the\nintroduction of online degree programs highlights the growing acceptance of\nonline education in its capability. Aided with a boost in infrastructure and\nhigh quality content, online education will not only accelerate skill\ndevelopment initiatives but also help \u2018right-skill\u2019 the workforce of the\nfuture. We anticipate that the announcement to improve the online education\necosystem will facilitate greater collaboration between educational\ninstitutions and online education platforms.\u201d\n\n **Sonica Aron, Managing Partner, Marching Sheep**\n\n\"This is a welcome change. Will increase take home and in hand disposable\nincome leading to higher consumption. Will have a positive spiral effect on\neconomy.Reduction of corporate tax will lead to freeing up of capital, and\nenable organisations to invest in growth engines. Also, will attract foreign\ninvestment. A welcome step again. Positive spiral impact on economy with more\nemployment opportunities\".\n\n **Rohan Parikh, Director, The Green Acres Academy**\n\nAs a country gearing up to have the largest \u2018working population\u2019 in the age\ngroup of 15 to 65 years of age by 2030, the Budget 2020 has adequately focused\non building a robust structure to drive higher education and skill\ndevelopment. From creating an efficient workforce of engineers, doctors, bio-\nmedics and IT professionals to nurturing skill-based qualities for\nentrepreneurs, sales and marketing professionals or commercial fine arts etc.,\nthe budget has taken into consideration the inclination of the youth and\naligned it to the economic growth targets, thereby strengthening the role of\neducation in building the $5 Trillion economy! Initiative like ECB and FDI in\neducation, access to full-fledged degree courses on the online platform,\noffered by top 100 institutions and the apprenticeship training at 150\ninstitutes for general studies, is a remarkable step that will boost the\naccess to education and training for the youth! The pivotal initiative of this\nbudget, however, is the introduction of Ind-SAT, a general entrance and\nscholarship examination for international students seeking higher education\nopportunities in India. I think this move will help put India officially on\nthe global map for education and boost the Indian education system and\ninfrastructure by welcoming international students to study in India. This is\na vital move in transforming India\u2019s education infrastructure by bringing in\nForeign Exchange, collaboration opportunities and developing world-class\ncourses and curriculums. We look forward to the new education policy announced\nby the government and believe this to be the start of a new era in Indian\neducation and skill development sector.\n\n **Vikramjit Singh Sahaye, Founder and CEO, Hiring Plug**\n\n\"This is a positive budget by the Finance Minister, given the current economic\ncircumstances. Reduction of tax slabs for salaried individuals is likely to\nincrease their disposable income, consumption and a better quality of life\".\n\n **Ravi Goyal, Chairman & MD, AGS Transact Technologies Ltd's**\n\n\u201cThe removal of dividend distribution tax will reassure the flow of FDI and\nmake Indian equities more attractive. This year\u2019s budget focused on\nentrepreneurship and early stage start-ups and the FM has provided a series of\nmeasures, that will encourage Indian start-ups whilst focusing on positioning\nentrepreneurs as job creators. The overall focus on boosting transport\ninfrastructure will help pursue greater commercialization of highways to raise\nfinance operating road assets. Recent developments to promote digital payments\nsuch as zero MDR are pre budget announcements and there was an expectation of\na clear roadmap from the government on supporting digital payments\ninfrastructure given the sector will be a major catalyst towards achieving the\n$5.5 trillion target.\u201d\n\n **Deepak Mittal, CEO and Co-founder, TO THE NEW**\n\n\"Being the first budget of the decade, this budget holds immense value &\nimportance and we are glad to see the government\u2019s continued commitment\ntowards positioning India a digital hub and fostering emerging technologies.We\nare thrilled with the announcement of a soon to be rolled out policy to enable\nprivate sector to build data center parks throughout the country. This would\nreap benefits such as on-demand access to ICT infrastructure, cater to Indian\nregulatory requirements as well as drive scalability for businesses in India.\nWe were, however, also expecting the government to announce measures with\nrespect to Data Protection keeping in mind the amount of Data being created\nand stored at unprecedented rates.\n\nMoreover, the government\u2019s move to set up an Investment Clearance Cell for\nentrepreneurs to offer assistance in funding, will certainly encourage more\nstart-ups to set up their businesses in India. This will, in turn, lead to the\ngrowth of the Indian economy. With a slew of growth measures announced, the\nemphasis of the government is very clear on the overall economic development.\"\n\n  \n\n **Ms. Yogita Tulsiani, Co-founder, iXceed Solutions**\n\n\"For the budget in 2020, it is a great achievement that India's economy is 5th\nlargest economy now. It's very promising and the avenues for recruitment in\nIndia are more now. Now local bodies will also offer an internship to fresh\nengineers. FM proposes a national recruitment agency to conduct an online\ncommon test for no gazetted posts which will speed up the things. The focus on\nAI, ML, IoT, Data Centre, etc across India is the need of the hour in today\u2019s\nfast-paced technological revolution.\"\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n[Raghav Gupta MD APAC](/tags/Raghav-Gupta-MD-APAC-103821/)\n[coursera](/tags/coursera-29338/) [Sonica Aron Marching Sheep](/tags/Sonica-\nAron-Marching-Sheep-103822/) [Rohan Parikh The Green Acres\nAcademy](/tags/Rohan-Parikh-The-Green-Acres-Academy-103823/) [Vikramjit Singh\nSahaye CEO Hiring Plug](/tags/Vikramjit-Singh-Sahaye-CEO-Hiring-Plug-103824/)\n[ravi goyal](/tags/ravi-goyal-33876/) [Kiran Dham CEO Globus\nInfocom](/tags/Kiran-Dham-CEO-Globus-Infocom-103825/) [Union Budget\n2020](/tags/Union-Budget-2020-102289/) [Post Budget Reactions](/tags/Post-\nBudget-Reactions-85551/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

Founder Mike\nFeerick's model for equal access to learning is gaining traction, not only in\nthe United States, Alison\u2019s largest market, but also across the world, not\nleast in developing nations.\n\nTo hear Feerick talk about Article 26 of the United Nations Declaration of\nHuman Rights Resolution that asserts that \u201cEducation will be free\u201d, his\npassion and belief in the idea is evident. He believes he has found a way to\nmake all knowledge and skills training sustainable and available at scale to\neveryone via the web, and, as the statistics above make clear, he has the data\nto prove that he is making serious progress.\n\n(To read future articles like this one,  please follow me on Twitter\n[@PeterAHigh](https://twitter.com/peterahigh?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).)\n\n**Peter High:** It has been said by some commentators that the MOOCs have not\nlived up to their potential. What is your perspective?\n\nAlison Founder & CEO Mike Feerick\n\nCredit: Alison\n\nToday In: [Tech](https://www.forbes.com/technology)\n\n  * [\n\n### Venture Capital Firm General Catalyst Raises $2.3 Billion Amid Coronavirus\nCrisis.\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2020/03/30/venture-capital-firm-\ngeneral-catalyst-raises-23-billion-amid-coronavirus-crisis/)\n\n  * [\n\n### E Pluribus Unum: Shared Sacrifice Will Be Needed To Beat Coronavirus Says\nDocumentarian Ken Burns\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2020/03/29/e-pluribus-unum-\nshared-sacrifice-will-be-needed-to-beat-coronavirus-says-documentarian-ken-\nburns/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Kevin Durant\u2019s Business Partner Rich Kleiman On How Star Athletes Are\nHandling The Coronavirus Crisis.\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2020/03/27/kevin-durants-\nbusiness-partner-rich-kleiman-on-how-star-athletes-are-handling-the-\ncoronavirus-crisis/)\n\n **Mike Feerick:** For sure, the \u201cMOOC\u201d concept has moved on. The Alison\nbusiness model of largely advertising supported education has endured and\nflourished, whereas other large free learning platforms still struggle to find\nworking business models. A difficulty of some platforms is being tied to\ntraditional educational institutions who resist high level disruption to\nprotect their old self-serving ways of doing things. Understanding the need to\nbreak from the past, some free learning platforms / MOOCs are hiring\nprofessionals from outside the education industry. Coursera just hired a\nfintech guy for instance. Unless they break those ties completely, I don\u2019t see\nhow they can take full advantage of the huge opportunity before them.\nSimilarly, other platforms, like Udacity, have gone small, refocusing on\nspecific types of training. Another challenge is the high costs of creating\ncontent some MOOCs have embraced. Having spent millions, some platforms are\nrealizing that you can publish very high-quality content more cheaply. Deep\npockets are only so deep \u2013 and it is an issue when you will have to publish\nmany tens of thousands of courses in the years ahead. Having said that, these\norganizations, along with Alison are pioneering a new world of educational\naccess, and there is a lot of room for various channels of success to deliver\nsocial impact.\n\nAs for Alison; Are we really a MOOC as some people now define it?  Well, we\nare massive, open, online, and we are courseware.  What Alison certainly is,\nis a free self-paced online learning platform focused on the workplace. The\nsearch is on for a workable acronym here; \u201cUniversal (Free) Learning Platform\u201d\nor \u201cULP\u201d might the better!\n\n**High:** Your focus at Alison is different from university content is it not,\ncorrect?\n\n**Feerick:** That\u2019s right. The workplace is our sweet spot. Globally, the\nworkforce market is far larger than the academic market will ever be, and that\ndistance is set to increase. We want to continue to be the global leader in\nthe workplace skills & training space and that will include providing free\nlearning more traditionally provided through the university systems.\n\n**High:** Alison is 11 years old now. Are you still completely self-financed?\n\n**Feerick:** Yes, we have been profitable and self-financed since 2007-2009.\nHaving said that, we are planning a fund-raise in Q1 2018. The execution\ndemands within the business are growing, such that we simply need a bigger\nmanagement team that organic growth won\u2019t allow us to fund in a timely manner.\nWe are doing well and getting a lot right. All the sane, as an old Navy friend\nof mine says, we need a \u201cBigger Hammer\u201d!\n\nWe started out 2017 phenomenally - signing up a half a million people in\nJanuary alone. To position ourselves for future growth, we did a complete\ntechnical overhaul of the platform in April \u2013 and just about digested the\nimpact of that now. Our first App is in Beta. There has been a huge growth in\nmobile \u2013 approaching now 50% of our traffic worldwide.\n\n**High:** How does Alison compare to other online learning systems?\n\n**Feerick:** Alison has its own unique free learning ecology: It is self-\npaced; you complete your course, at Certificate, Diploma or Learning Path\nlevel, at a time of your own choosing, and then take an assessment of 30+\nquestions. If you get an 80% grade, you are an Alison graduate. The tough part\nof holding an Alison award however is that you must to be ready to take a\nsimilar online test whenever anyone wishes to challenge you. When applying for\na job, if you have written down you hold an Alison Certificate or Diploma, as\nmany do, you better make sure you have retained that knowledge at an 80% pass\nrate level in case you are subject \u201chere and now\u201d test, on a laptop, tablet or\nsmartphone. The huge benefit of the Alison Free Learning Ecology is that both\nthe learning and certification is free.\n\nMost people realize that you can LEARN anything, anywhere, anytime via a\nsmartphone. People forget you can also be TESTED on any subject, anywhere, at\nany time. The ubiquity of the internet and the smartphone will change the\nworld of education as we know it. There is a new way to educate the world, and\nAlison is leading this. Many \u201cMOOCs\u201d are not self-paced, requiring you to turn\nup online at certain times each week. The truth is learners today are much\nmore demanding about when they want to learn. Another differentiation is that\nAlison is a social enterprise, albeit a for-profit one. We are determined make\nan excellent return of investment for our investors, but we will do that while\nstill putting free learner access first. It forces us to be more innovative.\nMy belief is long term, free will be the winning model for the universal scale\nwe aspire to. A free education strategy is not only socially powerful but\nsimply good business strategy.\n\nCEO Mike Feerick with Alison graduates in Lagos, Nigeria \u2013 Nov 2017\n\nCredit: Alison\n\nIn scale terms, Alison is up there with the tens of millions of learners with\nCoursera, Udemy and the Khan Academy, but bear in mind we have done what we\nhave done on less than $2m in original investment over the past 10 years+.\nWhen we plug in serious capital and management expertise through 2018, it is\ngoing to interesting to see what happens!\n\n**High:** So, it looks like you are primed to sell out then?!\n\n**Feerick:** No, not at all. We are in this for the long haul. I want to see\nbillions of people empowered by Alison. We have a mission and vision to\ndeliver on. If you could see what we see, you wouldn\u2019t be going anywhere\neither!\n\n**High:** Let\u2019s get back to how Alison works: What are Alison\u2019s completion\nrates?\n\n**Feerick:** For me to answer this question, you must first understand that\nAlison is a free learning platform. Anyone can pop into a course, look around,\nand leave, at no cost. Like any window shopper, they are not yet customers and\nshould not be recorded as such! If you look at our completions rates AFTER\nsomeone has spent more than 10m on a course, our completion rates are about\n35%.  Considering its free and you can leave at any time to another course, we\nthink that is impressive. Try swapping your course for free at your paid local\ncommunity college or university. Some stats suggest that community college\ncompletion rates are around 60%. While our figures are lower, given our\noffering is free, we unquestionably deliver phenomenal value. As most\neducation and skills training is government funded or subsidized in the USA,\nwe have the potential to save the Government at Federal and State level\nbillions of dollars of expenditure in the years ahead.\n\nAlison Graduates from West Palm Beach, Florida proudly sport their Alison\nGraduate T-Shirts!\n\n**High:** Where have you seen growth with the number of overall users?\n\n**Feerick:** Our most important market is the United States of America, but\nthe UK and India are not far behind. We have over 2m learners across Africa,\n(approaching 300,000 in Nigeria for instance). There is a huge need for what\nAlison provides and how we provide it. As someone can learn and certify for\nfree, it opens opportunity to the very poorest communities like no other\nlearning platform. Acceptance of Alison Certification is also becoming more\nwidespread worldwide. We have only 1,000 free courses now, but we aim to\nprovide learning on every subject, establishing universal standards of\nlearning on every subject. As our reputation has grown, the percentage of our\nrevenues represented by graduates buying certificate parchments has increased,\na strong validation in our view of who we are, what we do, and how we do it.\n\nOne of my favorite things to do when travelling around the world is to meet\nAlison Graduates, recording their stories of empowerment \u2013 how they have got\nnew jobs, promotions, college placements, started a business, or simply gained\nnew confidence as a result of learning for free online with Alison. It\u2019s a\nwonderful privilege to meet some amazing people. It re-enforces our\ndetermination, indeed our responsibility at Alison, to make free education\navailable to everyone. Not just the few.\n\n**High:** This all sounds so ambitious?\n\n**Feerick:** Well, it simply must be! Only 6.7% of the world have ever\ncompleted third level tertiary education worldwide. The other 93.3% cannot be\nleft behind, but neither can we education them like we ourselves have been\neducated in the past. We need new methodologies and new online systems, and\nour view at Alison is that for the world to engage all 93.3% in our lifetime,\neducation and skills training MUST be free. Piecemeal solutions are not good\nenough. We need a universal solution to offer education at any level to\neveryone, and the ubiquitous internet and smartphone allows us that\nopportunity. According to phone maker Erickson, 6 billion people will have\nsmartphones by 2020. What an amazing opportunity to educate people directly.\nSmartphone and broadband costs across the world are going down, and will\ncontinue to decrease. A friend from India was telling me the other day of a\nvillage in rural Gujarat where she knew of ten families sharing one\nsmartphone. Everyone gets their turn to access. Nothing can stop this\nmomentum.\n\nAlison CEO Mike Feerick with Alison Graduates in Lagos, Nigeria \u2013 Nov 2017\n\n**High:** So, I hear of Alison\u2019s impact, but tell me again how the business\nmodel works?\n\n**Feerick:** We make money in two ways: advertising and certificates. Because\nwe are a social enterprise, we don\u2019t insist graduates buy the certificates,\nbut about 10% of graduates do \u2013 either PDF or parchments. While some MOOCs are\ntrying to charge more and more for what they do, we are going the other way.\nWe are consistently reducing costs to our learners. We recently reduced our\ncertification PDF and parchment costs worldwide by 50%, and introduced free\ndelivery. We also introduced a way for learners to pay via referral of new\nlearners, as some people simply have no money at all to spend on educating\nthemselves.\n\nMore and more, we are finding that by embracing FREE more people come to you\nto study with us, and work with us, like governments and large NGOs. Our\nbusiness model is volume-based; the more people we have online, the less\nrevenue we need from each person to thrive.\n\n**High:** Tell me more about creating new standards on every subject?\n\n**Feerick:** Currently, around the world, because education has been so\npolitically connected in the past, there are different standards for\neverything, from Math to English. We can disrupt that by creating universal\nfree standards on every subject. For instance, for the English language as an\nexample, the big standards are the Cambridge English exams and The\nInternational English Language Testing System (IELTS). Millions of people\ncomplete these certifications every year. We have just created 140 courses\nthat go from beginner, to elementary, to intermediate, advanced, and on to\nproficiency to meet those same standards. If you want to learn to speak\nEnglish for free, or if your employer wants its workers to learn English, or\nspeak or read English better, you can introduce them to Alison and they can\npotentially go all the way.\n\nIs Alison likely to be as good as solution to teach them to speak English as\nsomeone teaching them one to one? Unlikely. Can we bring people a very long\nway however, the whole journey to English proficiency? Absolutely. We can, and\nat no direct cost to the learner, OR the employer. Costs are the learner\u2019s\ntime and the cost to get online.\n\n**High:** Alison is free to every learner, even for the employer?\n\n**Feerick:** Yes. Our strategy is that anything that is _need to have_ is\nfree, while _nice to have_ is paid. When companies start looking for a lot of\nvolume online, we start to charge. We also charge for extra things like\ndetailed reporting. Empowering the world to learn is not only about\nindividuals, it is also about companies. Huge companies with thousands of\nemployees often provide training to their employees, but smaller places like\nthe corner bakery, probably do not have any online learning. The employees\nsuffer for this. Today however, that \u201csuffering\u201d for the lack of workplace\ntraining is no longer necessary. If you can go online and complete courses,\nyou will empower not only yourself, but also those around you.\n\n**High:** If everyone has the potential to learn the same skills, are you not\ndevaluing the value of knowledge, and indeed, the cost of labor?\n\n**Feerick:** That\u2019s not the way to look at it in my view. Think about it in\nanother way: why not educate and upskill everyone so the value of the work\nthey do is higher, and naturally commands a higher price?   With free learning\nand skills training, we should be about empowering people to earn more because\nthey can do more, and add more value to their work. It is all about\nempowerment.\n\n**High:** You say that the world\u2019s response to the growing \u201cSkills Gap\u201d is\nthat we should \u201cautomate learning\u201d. Explain.\n\n**Feerick:** The essential problem with traditional learning is that it is too\nslow as it does not create new courses quickly enough. It is too shallow in\nterms of the breath of learning it can provide, and everything simply costs\ntoo much. We need to change all of this. We need to take down the barriers to\nlearning such that basic workplace knowledge and skills are not held back for\nransom to be paid for release. Where sharing knowledge is economically\nincentivized, with courses rapidly produced, and quality assured, we can\ncreate a system of upskilling available to anyone, anywhere, once they have\nthe will and determination to empower themselves by learning.\n\nAt the end of the day, if there are a hundred experts in a room, you only need\none to step outside to share what they know to educate the world. To make this\nhappen, there are four solution elements required: These are free learning,\nfree certification, free learning management (so you can manage groups of\nlearners), and finally, free publishing. These features are freely accessible\non the Alison free learning platform. The Alison team are not subject matter\nexperts on every subject. What we are experts at is two-fold; firstly, as\nengineers, we have the expertise to run a very large free learning\nplatform/website, and secondly, we have make sure that while we may not be the\nsubject matter experts, we do have the pedagogic (Science of Learning)\nexpertise to be able to assess whether a new course is structured for learning\nproperly.\n\n**High:** Can you explain how someone becomes a publisher and the payment\nstructure?\n\n**Feerick** : When subject matter experts publish content on Alison, we share\nthe revenue 50/50. If the learning content is popular, publishers can make\ntens of thousands of dollars a year, as some do. There is a simple application\nprocess via the website. The most successful publishers are the ones who don\u2019t\nrely exclusively on Alison to promote their courses online to it millions of\nlearners worldwide, but bring their own marketing network to the platform\nalso.\n\n**High:** I have heard you say that education is ripe for disruption. What do\nyou mean by that?\n\n**Feerick** : I read an interesting piece of research from McKinsey that was\npublished recently. It listed the industries that are ready to be disrupted by\nautomation, and education was at the bottom. The thinking is that because\neducation involves a lot of judgment, it is less likely to be disrupted. I\ndisagree.\n\nWe can compare education to Uber and Airbnb. With Uber, there are people that\nneed to go places, there are people with cars, and there is a platform that\nmatches them up. However, what Uber really does is pull latent supply into the\nindustry that was not there before, and provide extra service. It is the same\nwith Airbnb; There is a spare room out there, there are people that need a\nplace to stay, the platform draws them in. Similar possibilities exist with\neducation. There are an awful lot of people who know stuff, and who can teach,\nbut who are not teaching. They need to be brought to the marketplace.\n\n**High:** And you see this as being relevant within corporations too?\n\n**Feerick** : To retain competitiveness, we need to help organizations become\nmuch more agile by putting in the hands of many more people the training and\ntools to enable them to teach. We can greatly increase the knowledge flow and\nskills transfers within organizations if we can convince more people to\npublish what they know and give them the skills and tools to do it. Our free\npublishing tool assists this learning transfer.\n\nOur tools for learning are so accessible that you have what you need to create\na vibrant agile organization where everyone is a learner and a teacher. I like\nto use the analogy of the human body. The human nervous system is sensory and\nresponsive. It has constant inputs and outputs. We need to create a learning\nculture across all levels of our organizations where instead of learning going\none way, it has to be like the human body, it has to be coming in and going\nout. There must be a purer flow. With free learning, certification, learning\nmanagement systems, and publishing, organizations can allow knowledge and\nskills to flow within organizations like never before.\n\n**High:** You talk about introducing the \u201cPower of the Crowd\u201d into education?\n\n**Feerick** : Yes, this is how we can guarantee high quality learning, even if\nmillions of courses are being produced, i.e. run the learning content through\na rating system between the service provider (Publisher/Teacher) and the\nconsumer (Learner). With Airbnb, the lodger rates the host and the host the\nlodger. Same with Uber, between the passenger and driver. With Alison, the\npublisher puts up a course, the learner rates it, as well as a peer group, as\nwell as the pedagogic team at Alison, Collective assessment of various\nstakeholders filters the quality to a higher and higher level. When many\npeople become involved, you get this powerful crowd dynamic.\n\nWhen you visit a new city and you want to book a hotel, what do you look at?\nDo you look to see if the hotel is part of the local Hotel Federation, or do\nyou look at the recent reviews on TripAdvisor? When I ask this questions at\ntalks, the audience invariably nods that Trip Advisor is where they go to get\na trusted assessment on a place to stay. What are people doing here? People\nare ditching the old accreditation models for an informal \u201cpower of the crowd\u201d\nendorsement. The \u201cPower of the Crowd\u201d or \u201cDistributed Trust\u201d model is being\nintroduced into education \u2013 and Alison will lead the way on this.\n\n**High:** You talk about the rise of Corporate Certification in terms of\ncompetition with universities. What do you mean by that?\n\n**Feerick** : Well, I am not predicting the total demise of the university\nsector. There are some things that need to get done locally, like providing\nthe laboratory for your chemistry experiments, providing face to face\nengagement with professors, or team exercises for instance. However, where\nuniversities don\u2019t add much unique value anymore is at the core of their\ncurrent offering which they charge most for, i.e. the distribution of subject\nknowledge.\n\nIn a world of free learning, anything that can be learned online for free,\nwill be learned online for free, and it will be hard to charge for that\nsharing of knowledge or skill. With this view in mind, I can see many more\ncorporations creating certified learning around their own products and\nservices, because frankly, they can. Who are the experts in electricity\ngeneration, Siemens that build generators, or the electrical engineering\nprofessors who take an academic view of the subject? Who is closer to the new\nknowledge and skill sets in any industry, industry or academia. You know the\nanswer.\n\nNow that people can access learning, certification, learning management\nsystems, and publishing for free, a corporation can build suites of\ncertifications for every product and every service they offer. When you sell a\nproduct or service that is worth more than $5,000 \u2013 or perhaps even less, you\nwant people using it to use it well. In fact, if your customer who has paid a\nlot of money does not know how to use the product correctly, you the supplier\nare going to be hurt in the long term because they are not going to get the\nfull value out of it. You can make sure they know how to use your product by\nencouraging them to complete a certificate course \u2013 perhaps by giving a rebate\nfor the company agreeing to do so.\n\nI often ask CEO\u2019s and CIO\u2019s of corporations, \u201cDoes every employee in your\ncompany know what products and services you sell? If not, why not?  Have you\ntested them to find out? Does your staff know how your products and services\nhave changed over the year? Why not?  What if creating courses to internalize\nthis information and knowledge was much easier and more efficient? If you have\nthousands of employees, they should be thousands of salespeople. If they are\ngoing home for holidays, they should know what you sell. Reducing the barriers\nto sharing knowledge helps this knowledge flow. In fact, from an economics\npoint of view, with a more perfect flow of knowledge and skill out there,\ncompetition is going to get much tougher. Either you do this or someone else\nwill do it for you \u2013 and take your customers.\n\n**High:** You talk about formal education becoming weaker \u2013 and informal\nbecoming stronger -what do you mean by that?\n\n**Feerick** : Particularly in hiring, people are moving away from focusing on\na college degree and toward aptitude tests. If you ask everyone in a room what\nthey put at the top of their CV, they will say their formal education. If you\nask them how many would like to be tested on those qualifications here and\nnow, all you hear is nervous laughter.\n\nBecause the knowledge we need to know for the work we do is changing faster\nand faster, traditional education earned expensively over a long period of\ntime is delivering less and less value to those who invest in it. More and\nmore companies are abandoning the college stuff. Then can test what you now on\nany subject at any time, and through psychometric testing, can figure out just\nhow smart you are and how quickly you might learn new things and ways of\nworking.  The idea that you managed to pass a degree ten years ago is becoming\nincreasingly irrelevant. What do you know now? What you can do now? That is\nwhat matters.\n\n**High:** So informal learning is on the march!\n\n**Feerick** : You better believe it! The education and training systems of\ntoday provide too little value and cost too much. Increasingly, you can learn\nwhat you want, when you want online. What you need at the end of the day is a\nplatform, an arbitrager or collector of the world\u2019s information and an entity\nto be the arbiter of quality \u2013 and that\u2019s where the likes of Alison comes in,\nled by someone like me!\n\nWhat is most exciting about this is that this way of measurement of someone\u2019s\ntalent and capability is a lot more equitable than taking someone into\nemployment because they graduated from what once was a \u201ctop college\u201d. Among\nthe 93% of people who have not had the opportunity of third level education\nare some of the brightest and most talented individuals on earth. Many of\nthese people live in developing countries. In fact, statistically, most of\nthem certainly do. Giving these people access to education in this way is not\njust good for them, but good for all of us.\n\n**High:** Is American Industry in real trouble of being passed by?\n\n**Feerick** : If American industry does not respond to use these powerful new\nknowledge and upskilling tools creatively as good as the next country, then\nyes, its in deep trouble. I am hoping that that will not be the case. The one\nthing that the United States has \u2013 as good as any country I know, is that its\npeople are innately competitive. Americans like to compete. It is an insurance\npolicy, but then again, it is only so strong. There is going to be a much more\nlevel global playing field in the future \u2013 and the USA needs to appreciate it\nis just 4% of the world\u2019s population! There is a lot of competition out there.\n\n**High:** Why do you think Informal Learning is going to become \u201cMandatory\u201d?\n\n**Feerick** : What I am saying is that informal learning is in reality how\nmost of us learn, and we now have a better was to qualify that learning. When\ngoing to work in a company, why shouldn\u2019t every prospective employee have done\nand passed basic courses about working in a business \u2013 understanding basic\naccounting, human resources, marketing and so on \u2013 and why should they learn\nthese basic business subjects on the dime of the company that is about to hire\nthem?  They should come with these courses already completed. It costs time,\nnot dollars to learn. In that sense, with free learning, others can expect you\nto know stuff that in times past, you would get a bye on.\n\nFree learning empowers people and the people around them, so it\u2019s in the\ninterest of government everywhere to encourage it. Studies shows learning\nonline successfully improves personal confidence \u2013 and encourages people to\nlearn even MORE.  Hence, government should insist in interviews that people\nare not just asked about formal learning but informal learning also.\n\nInformal learning provides an opportunity for learners to differentiate\nthemselves. When hiring, employers should be compelled to ask \u2013 we know you\nmight have done a degree \u2013 but what have you learned lately?\n\nRecently, I spoke at a conference in Estonia with many ministers of skills\nfrom all around Europe. A concern that was voiced is that there are 70 to 80\nmillion people in Europe that are not digitally literate. Governments are\ngetting frustrated with this. They want to help but some people need to be\ngently prodded to see the benefits of learning. Legal and tax incentives are\nbeing considered to nudge this movement along. In that sense, you are going to\nsee mandatory learning \u2013 made much easier because access to the learning \u2013 and\nthe development of digital literacy content of course can also be free.\n\n**High:** So, the world of learning is about to change beyond recognition?\n\n**Feerick** : Not just the world of learning, but the world itself. Education\nunderpins all social progress. We have many great societal issues of\ninequality, ignorance, poverty that can be profoundly dealt with if we use the\ngift of free learning to its fullest extent. The biggest threat we face may\nwell be global warming, but how well we deal with that threat is again\nprofoundly linked to how well we explain the risks and teach everyone how best\nto navigate the troubles that lie in store. Politically, what if people could\nbe taught to discern much better what news sources to give credence to?  Yes,\nwe have the potential to change the world by making access to education and\nskills training available to all. The question your readers must ask\nthemselves is what are they doing individually, within their workplaces, to\nallow the free learning revolution impact the world around them?\n\n[_Peter High_](http://http//blogs-images.forbes.com/peterhigh/) _  is\nPresident of _[ _Metis Strategy_](http://www.metisstrategy.com/) _, a\n[business](http://www.forbes.com/ordercheck/) and IT advisory firm.

What does this cry for HTML5 mean for e-learning developers?\n\n## That Was Then\n\nWhen e-learning was first gaining momentum (about 15 to 20 years ago),\nbuilding courseware required some degree of programming capability: HTML and\nJavaScript to build a primary code base, ActionScript in Flash to create\ninteractive objects and content, and a good knowledge of SCORM standards.\n\nI would present at conferences and proclaim that attendees needed some of\nthese programming skills. People would smile, shake my hand, and agree to\nlearn more programming skills\u2014and then they would hire me to create their\nprograms for them. Simply, many instructional designers and facilitators\ncharged with building e-learning were not interested in computer programming.\n\nFortunately, e-learning authoring tools came into prominence. Soon, everyone\nwas an e-learning programmer. You simply opened PowerPoint, created a\npresentation, and clicked a button to have an interface wrap your PPT in a\nnice SCORM package.\n\nAnd for a long time, many e-learning authoring tools exported solely to a\nFlash format, and the .swf files they generated required the Flash player for\nlearners to view the content in a browser. This was great because the Flash\nplayer was already built into every desktop browser, so everyone could view\nthe Flash content.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoil\u00e0, your e-learning projects were complete! Check the box! Done!\n\n## This Is Now\n\nIn 2015, however, the Flash player does not function on mobile devices, and is\neven falling into antiquity, in some experts\u2019 opinions. Instead, industry\nleaders are rallying behind the HTML5 banner. Led by Apple, the cry has\nsounded: \u201cFlash is DEAD!\u201d Meanwhile, programmers like me are saying, \u201cLong\nLive Flash!\u201d Why? Because e-learning \u201cprogrammers,\u201d who solely use authoring\ntools to build their courseware, are not able to create compelling e-learning\ninteractions with the support of Flash.\n\nIndeed, most companies are asking for HTML5 to become the standard, and\ntraditional e-learning programmers are forced to comply. So, although the\nadvent of authoring tools was a good way for companies to rapidly build\ne-learning libraries (because they made the \u201cprogramming\u201d piece of e-learning\ndevelopment as easy as creating PowerPoint slides), it\u2019s not good when the\nstandards start to change.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s the rub: HTML5 requires developers to go back to being programmers. In\nfact, the same designers rallying behind the HTML5 banner are taking a\ncollective gasp, asking: What do you mean my authoring tool can\u2019t export to\nHTML5? For developers like me, it\u2019s an easy leap back into the world of hand\ncoding, WYSIWYG programming, and browser testing. Developers who have only\nused authoring tools, though, are probably going to struggle in this new\nworld.\n\nTo be sure, several popular authoring tools now export to HTML5, but the\nconsistency of the projects to work across browsers is still an issue. The\nauthoring tools are getting better, but until a pure HTML5 authoring tool is\navailable (they are coming!!!!), the best way to create HTML5 content is to\ncode it specifically for the device used in your environment. Bottom line: The\nonly way to properly create a solid HTML5 course is to hand code it yourself.\n\nBasically, this means that industry has come full circle\u2014back to programming\nour own e-learning courseware, back to web standards, back to structured\nprogramming. So, if you ran away from programming and hand coding (and into\nthe arms of your favorite e-learning authoring tool), but are now on the HTML\n5 bandwagon, you are going to face a huge learning curve.\n\n**For guidance on how to pair e-learning development tools with your own\nprogramming skills, check out _[Technology for\nTrainers](https://www.td.org/Publications/Books/Technology-for-Trainers-2)_ ,\n2nd Edition.

Here is a look at the emerging trends in the EdTech space.\n\n![Emerging trends in EdTech- A look at the EdTech\nlandscape](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1538573659/1538573466.jpg)\n\nFor long, learning has been administered by traditional pedagogical\ntechniques. However, the continuous changes in technology have changed the\nentire paradigm of learning and development at corporates. The rapid\nintegration of technology in learning has made the educational technology\nsector (EdTech) as a promising market not only in the world but India too. A\nrecent report by KPMG and Google highlights that the EdTech market is expected\nto touch $1.96 Bn by 2021, with close to 9.6 Mn users, from $247 Mn and over\n1.6 Mn users in 2016.\n\n![Edtech_Landscape_Online_Technology_Funding_Trends](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1538573339/nAdd_a_little_bit_of_body_text_i9aq2c.jpg)\n\nFor several years now, innovations in EdTech have impacted how business\nprofessionals want to learn. EdTechs such as virtual classrooms, mobile\ndevices, digital readers, on-demand video, online gaming, and cloud-based LMSs\nhave fed the market that has been, and continues to be hungry for innovation.\nTraditionally, most investments for product innovation in EdTech were focused\non the higher education market. But recently, investors have looked across the\ntraditional market boundaries beyond higher education and toward corporate\ntraining. In fact, according to a study, the global investments in educational\nEdTech in 2017 crossed $9 Bn, a 30 percent jump from 2016. It was also\nreported that 813 different EdTech companies received funding last in 2017.\nOne of the critical drivers for rising interest in EdTech can be the adoption\nrate of new technologies by the millennial community. Millennials entering the\njob market bring a new set of expectations on how to learn and collaborate.\nHence, investment is flowing into the EdTech market at an unprecedented level.\n\n![Edtech_Funding_Education_Technology](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1538570518/813_3_zs2pzs.jpg)\n![Edtech_Funding_Global_Education_Technoloy_Learning](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1538570559/9.52_Bn_m58kcl.jpg)\n![Edtech_Learning_Technology_Education_Technology](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1538571064/Total_number_of_deals_made_in_2017_1_l2vebc.jpg)\n![Countries_Funding_Learning_Edtech_Technology_China_India_US](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1538571767/Capture_psc5jz.jpg)According to Metaari\nadvanced learning technology report 2017, over $3.79 Bn was invested in\ncorporate-facing educational technology companies in 2017, trailing consumer-\nfacing companies by $60 Mn. Corporate training and education buyers across the\nglobe are migrating rapidly away from legacy products like self-paced\ncourseware and are now avid buyers of psychometric Game-based Learning, AI-\nbased Learning, Cognitive Learning, and Mixed Reality Learning (that includes\nboth VR and AR-based products).\n\nPeople Matters reached out to the leaders in the EdTech industry and\nunderstood the evolution, trends, and challenges in EdTech. Here are the key\nfindings:\n\n### Evolution of Learning Technology\n\n_**\u201cCompetency development and reskilling have become a way of life, not a\nstage in life.\u201d**_\n\n![Raghav_Gupta_Coursera_Edtech_Funding_Online_Learning](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1538571961/Raghav_Gupta_Director_India_and_APAC_Coursera_4_1_fpwfpb.jpg)\n\n**Raghav Gupta, Director - India and APAC at Coursera**  \n  \nOnline learning has evolved significantly beyond its previous reputation for\nlow-quality learning experiences from low tier institutions. The flexible,\nhigh quality and affordable nature of the content provided by online learning\nplatforms today are changing the way people learn.\n\n_**\u201cFrom a one-for-all approach to the ability to construct one\u2019s learning\npath.\u201d**_\n\n![Nikhil_Barshikar_Imarticus_Learning_Technology](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1538572371/Capture_sm6fxg.jpg)\n\n**Nikhil Barshikar, Founder and MD at Imarticus Learning**  \n  \nOver the next few years, EdTech will experience a rapid change in its\nconsumption pattern. From a one-for-all approach, EdTech is now on the brink\nof personalization to the extent where individual consumers will have the\nability to construct their learning paths. AI and Machine Learning will play a\nsignificant role in defining this new approach with meaningful recommendations\nand customized learning journeys.\n\n_**\u201cEdTech has reinvented the way of delivering learning.\u201d**_\n\n![Krishna_Kumar_Simplilearn_Founder_Learning_Technology_Online_Technology_Edtech](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1538571502/krishna_lvg2lg.jpg)\n\n**Krishna Kumar, Founder & CEO, Simplilearn  \n  \n**Innovation in technology is changing the way we deliver online education.\nEdTech is not only making learning affordable and accessible to the deepest\nroots of the country but has also triggered the upskilling and reskilling\nphenomena among students and professionals. With the impact of online learning\nbecoming evident, EdTech has gained credibility among the government,\nindustry, and academia which is spurring further mass adoption of this medium\nof learning.\n\n### Emerging trends in EdTech Sector:\n\nIn an interview with Coursera, Imarticus Learning, and Simplilearn we found\nthat new innovative technologies are triggering a wave of transformation in\nthe Indian education and learning sector - both regarding the content and the\ndelivery. Here are the key trends in the EdTech sector:\n\n  * **Use of emerging technologies like AI, ML, AR, VR:**\n\nAR/VR/AI and other emerging technologies will redefine the EdTech space and\nthe online learning experience.\n\n\u201cWith an emphasis on skill building across industries and professionals\nproactively upskilling themselves, trends like hands-on learning, byte-sized\nlearning coupled with gamification, virtual reality, and AI are changing the\nonline learning landscape. EdTech companies need to adopt these trends\nseamlessly into their learning programs to ensure learners are motivated and\nengaged to complete their courses targeted with specific outcomes,\u201d says Kumar\n\nRaghav shares, \u201cWith the integration of new age technologies like AI, VR, ML,\nthe learning experience will be more interactive and personalized; resulting\nin improved access and enhanced learner outcomes.\u201d\n\n  * **Bite-sized or micro-learning modules:**\n\nNikhil shares, bite-sized or micro-learning modules which cater specifically\nto the content consumption habits of young digital consumers are increasingly\ngaining traction in the EdTech space. Also, mobile is the preferred channel\namong young students and professionals to consume online learning courses.\nAlso, mobile is the favorite channel among young students and professionals to\nconsume online learning courses. This is because it allows them the\nflexibility to access content anytime and anywhere through easy-to-use app\ninterfaces.\n\n  * **Personalization:**\n\nPersonalization remains a top trend among EdTech firms offering their online\nlearning platforms since it helps to drive maximum user engagement and deliver\nspecially curated content to learners on a variety of subjects and topics.\n\nNo doubt, the EdTech industry is brimming with opportunities, but at the same,\nit is rife with challenges. The most common challenges faced by the EdTech\ncompanies and startups are:\n\n**Acquisition Cost** \\- Since online training is not bound by geography,\nneither are its customers which means, the same set of training providers try\nto attract a specific set of candidates. This increases the cost of acquiring\nleads, and therefore, acquisition becomes a significant challenge.\n\u201cMaintaining a healthy bottom line is EdTech's Holy Grail,\u201d says Nikhil.\n\n**Engagement Rates** \\- MOOCs typically have completion rates of less than\n10%. A big challenge faced by all EdTech providers is keeping its learners\nengaged in the learning lifecycle. Several values added services like\nprojects, coaching and mentoring and gamification techniques are used these\ndays to ensure higher completion.\n\nHowever, Raghav is of the view that the challenges with engagement rates are\ndiminishing. Raghav says, \u201cIntroducing credible degrees continue to be the\nmost transformative credential for career and economic mobility globally.\nConstantly broadening the portfolio to bring full-fledged online degrees in\ndomains across Business, Data Science, Entrepreneurship, Public Health, and\nComputer Science would help in elevating the engagement among users.\u201d\n\nKumar believes that this is the best time for players like them as EdTech is\nproliferating globally and in India. He shares that EdTech companies need to\nharness the potential of technology to close the skill gap by delivering\ntraining in the latest digital technologies with product excellence and a\ncustomer-centric approach.\n\n_Know more about such trends at the People Matters Learning & Development\nAnnual Conference 2018 on 23rd October.

We, as\na nation, have recognized the importance of a skilled workforce and skilling.\nThe United Nations has designated 15 July as 'World Youth Skills Day' to\npromote conversations and generate greater awareness on the importance of\ntechnical, vocational education, and training and the development of other\nskills.\n\nWorld Youth Skills Day is celebrated in order to raise awareness about the\nimportance of investing in youth skills development across the world. Through\nSkill India Mission and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (#PMKVY), India\naims to enable over 10 million youth to take up industry-relevant skills in\nthe coming year. World Youth Skills Day is just setting the stage for\nmarketing how Skill Development could be a tool for empowerment and\nemployment.\n\nLabourNet, a social enterprise that enables sustainable livelihoods for men,\nwomen and youth in urban and rural areas, resonates with this idea of\npromoting meaningful dialogue and believes that it will highlight youth skills\ndevelopment and draws attention to the critical need for marketable skills\namongst the youth across the globe with the theme of \u201cLearning to learn for\nlife and work.\" LabourNet is continually empowering millions of livelihoods\nvia skilling interventions to keep up the momentum in supporting and promoting\nskill development and drive a positive change. Along with the government,\nLabourNet is also on a mission to enable the livelihoods of 10 million youth\nby 2024.\n\nRajesh A R, CEO, and MD \u2013 LabourNet, \u201cIndia has an unemployment rate of around\n6 percent. But the sad part of this unemployment is that most of them are\ngraduates. An even bigger threat is that 300 million of the 500 million\nworkforce earn less than 3 dollars a day. Underemployment is the biggest\nthreat we as an industry is facing. This is happening because of the\nmisalignment of candidate expectations and the employer needs. A candidate,\nafter going through a basic skilling program is expecting market wages from a\npremium market wages. At the same time, an employer is willing to pay a\npremium of the market wages only if the candidate has experience along with\nthe skilling certificate.\"\n\nHe added, \"LabourNet, with its solutions, is addressing this problem. Our\nSchool Learning Services (SLS) need to ensure that students who are passing\nout of the SLS are given industry exposure either through apprenticeship or\nthrough earn-and-learn programs. Through our ELS program (Entrepreneurship\nLearning Service) where the candidates are already working with lower wages,\nwe need to do handholding programs like the Entrepreneurship Development\nPrograms and ensure they are given skills as well as experience at the work\nsite to reach to the market wages. On this World Youth Skills Day, we pledge\nto get all our candidates at a market premium and open the doors for\nprosperity\u201d.\n\nTo mark the occasion, LabourNet held a series of activities across the country\nlike rallies, awareness programs and guest lectures to enlighten the masses\nregarding relevant issues and how skills can rescue them.\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n[skills](/tags/skills-52187/) [unemployment](/tags/unemployment-12748/)\n[PMKVY](/tags/PMKVY-78728/) [employment](/tags/employment-2644/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

For instance, when buying groceries many people have\ntransitioned from a \u201cjust-stock\u201d mode, which uses a long grocery list to stock\nup for weeks, to \u201cjust-in-time\u201d ordering via a service like Amazon fresh. New\ntechnologies are helping to create a future where purchases will be triggered\nautomatically based on your individual preferences, past consumption patterns,\nand current needs.\n\n****Just Stock****\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n****Just In Time****\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n******Just For Me**  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n  \nComprehensive content\n\nIf available\n\nWhen ready\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\nRight quantity of\n\nRight content at the\n\nRight time\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\nCustomized content\n\nIn context\n\nDelivered, proactively  \n  \nSimilarly, learning and development also needs to evolve to reflect how\nconsumers of content are changing their behaviors and expectations. Content\nusers are no longer looking to read through copious content; instead, they\nexpect to have highly relevant content in just enough quantities exactly when\nthey need. For example, consider a scenario in which a software sales rep who\nis stuck in the negotiation stage of a deal for more two months. The following\nlearning modes can offer different learning experiences for the rep.\n\n**Just Stock**\n\nAdvertisement\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n**Just In Time**\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\n**Just For Me**  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n  \nThe learning team has realized \u201cnegotiation\u201d is a key skill challenge.\n\nIt engages one of the best negotiation skills training vendor who researches\nneeds and develops comprehensive training that includes role plays, exercises,\nand quizzes.\n\nIt makes the course available online, requiring learners to complete quizzes\nto advance to the next topic.\n\nThe rep searches for negotiation skills content and registers for training.\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\nThe rep searches for top negotiation tactics.\n\nThe learning system understands the specific content need\u2014and not that the rep\nis seeking a five-hour negotiation training class covering buyer psychology a\nmonth from now.\n\nThe learning system serves up micro-content that lists the top 10 negotiation\ntips that have been most read and rated highly by other users.\n\nThe learning system also aggregates informal content available in sales\ncommunity discussion boards on the same topic.\n\n|\n\n\n\n|\n\nLearning system understands the context: \u201cThe rep is struggling to close a\nlarge multi-product multi-year deal in a mid-sized healthcare company against\na specific competitor.\u201d\n\nThe learning system analyzes similar deals won and recommends optimal pricing\nagainst the competitor involved, competitive battle cards for products in the\ndeal, and key negotiation tips pertinent for similar deal sizes, proactively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCustomer referrals and ROI calculations is also delivered by email directly to\nthe customer.  \n  \nIf you were in this rep\u2019s shoes, which learning mode would you prefer?\nObviously, just-in-time and just-for-me learning.  But like all good things,\nthese come with a price tag.\n\nJust-for-me learning involves skill set changes for the learning team, as well\nas behavioral changes in the learners. This requires data scientists and\nperformance coaches to be a part of the sales enablement team.  It also relies\non sales reps to enter pipeline data in a very timely fashion so they can\naccess recommendations proactively.\n\nLikewise, just-in-time learning involves a complete mindset change in content\ndevelopers along with transformational change in learning development and\ndelivery process and infrastructure. For example, the learning function may no\nlonger have three months to conduct a needs assessment, design instruction,\nwrite training content, and pilot training courseware.\n\nL&D professionals in sales enablement may no longer be offering comprehensive,\nimmersive training that includes booster, supplemental, or follow-up content.\nAction-oriented content design\u2014tool, tips, templates, tactics, and so forth\u2014is\nthe norm. In fact, content will need to be chunked and summarized to fit the\ntime constraints of sales rep trying to meet end-f-quarter quotas.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the learning functions can no long only count on seasoned\ninstruction designers with domain experience to fulfill these needs. Leaders\nmust tap the skills of sales incumbents who have closed hundreds of deals\neffectively negotiating with various stakeholders.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how to meet these just-in-time sales enablement needs.\n\n##\n\n## #1. Attention\n\nGarner genuine attention using \u201clearning by objective\u201d principles. For\nexample, instead of marketing a negotiation training without context, send\npersonalized message quoting the percent of opportunities in pipeline that\nstalled in negotiation stage and how closing them will result in $350K toward\nmeeting the quota.\n\n## #2. Adoption\n\nImprove adoption by scheduling the delivery at the right time\u2014when the stakes\nare high. This will ensure reps not only read the email but also consume the\ncontent. For example, instead of marketing negotiation training in Q1 (when\nonly one small deal is in late stage), send an email when a good number of\ndeals are in negotiation stage.\n\n## #3. Absorption\n\nEnsure absorption by delivering chunked micro-content. This will allow the rep\nto learn the most important tenets right away, then schedule more later. For\nexample, instead of sending a link to negotiation training, summarize the top\nfive negotiation techniques in the body of an email and then follow it up with\nanother five tips the next week. Add a short survey to pinpoint which new\ntechniques were helpful.\n\n## #4. Application\n\nProvide application-oriented content like pitch videos and templates. Reps can\nuse these tools right away, and then try to connect academic content to\napplication context. For example, in addition to negotiation tips, also\nprovide templates of ROI calculation to show cost of ownership or a price\nvalue map against competition. In other words, add items and tools that the\nrep can forward to prospects immediately.\n\n## #5.

pre-dawn light, the ship doesn\u2019t look unusual. It is one more\nsilhouette looming pier-side at Naval Base [San\nDiego](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p5249k), a home port of the\n[US Pacific Fleet](https://www.afr.com/link/follow-20180101-p52422). And the\nscene playing out in its forward compartment, as the crew members ready\nthemselves for departure, is as old as the navy itself. Three sailors in blue\ncoveralls heave on a massive rope. \u201cAvast!\u201d a fourth shouts. A percussive\nthwack announces the pull of a tugboat \u2013 and 3000 tonnes of warship are under\nway.\n\nBut now the sun is up, and the differences start to show.\n\nMost obvious is the ship\u2019s lower contour. Built in 2014 from 30 million cans\u2019\nworth of Alcoa aluminium, Littoral Combat Ship 10, the USS Gabrielle Giffords,\nrides high in the water on three separate hulls and is powered like a jet ski\n\u2013 that is, by water-breathing jets instead of propellers. This lets it move\nswiftly in the coastal shallows (or \u201clittorals\u201d, in seagoing parlance), where\nit\u2019s meant to dominate.\n\nUnlike the older ships now gliding past \u2013 guided-missile cruisers, destroyers,\namphibious transports \u2013 the littoral combat ship was built on the concept of\n\u201cmodularity\u201d. There\u2019s a voluminous hollow in the ship\u2019s belly, and its insides\ncan be swapped out in port, allowing it to set sail as a submarine hunter,\nminesweeper or surface combatant, depending on the mission.\n\nThe ship\u2019s most futuristic aspect, though, is its crew. The LCS was the first\nclass of navy ship that, because of technological change and the high cost of\npersonnel, turned away from specialists in favour of \u201chybrid sailors\u201d who have\nthe ability to acquire skills rapidly. It was designed to operate with a mere\n40 souls on board \u2013 one-fifth the number aboard comparably sized \u201clegacy\u201d\nships and a far cry from the 350 aboard a World War II destroyer. The small\nsize of the crew means each sailor must be like the ship itself: a jack of\nmany trades and not, as 240 years of tradition have prescribed, a master of\njust one.\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nLaszlo Bock, Google\u2019s former culture chief and now the head of the HR start-up\nHumu, looks for mental agility when he hires. The New York Times\n\nOn most navy ships, only a boatswain\u2019s mate \u2013 the oldest of the navy\u2019s 60-odd\noccupations \u2013 would handle the ropes, which can quickly remove a finger or\nfoot. But none of the three sailors heaving on the Giffords\u2019 ropes is a line-\nhandling professional. One is an information-systems technician. The second is\na gunner\u2019s mate. And the third is a chef. \u201cWe wear a lot of hats here,\u201d\nCulinary Specialist 2nd Class Damontrae Butler says. After the ropes are put\naway, he reports to the ship\u2019s galley, picks up a basting brush and starts\nreadying a tray of garlic bread for the oven.\n\nTwo boatswain\u2019s mates are on hand, but only to instruct and oversee \u2013 and they\ntoo wear lots of hats, between them: fire-team leader, search-and-rescue\nswimmer, crane operator, deck patroller, helicopter-salvage co-ordinator. The\noperative concept is \u201cminimal manning\u201d. On the bridge, five crew members do\nthe jobs usually done by 12, thanks to high-tech display screens and the\nship\u2019s several thousand remote sensors. And below decks, once-distinct\nengineering roles \u2013 electrician\u2019s mate, engine man, machinist, gas-turbine\ntechnician \u2013 fall to the same handful of sailors.\n\nMinimal manning \u2013 and with it, the replacement of specialised workers with\nproblem-solving generalists \u2013 isn\u2019t a particularly nautical concept. Indeed,\nit will sound familiar to anyone in an organisation who\u2019s been asked to \u201cdo\nmore with less\u201d \u2013 which, these days, seems to be just about everyone. Ten\nyears from now, [Deloitte consultant Erica\nVolini](https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-\ntrends/2019/impact-of-ai-turning-jobs-into-superjobs.html) projects, 70 to 90\nper cent of workers will be in so-called hybrid jobs or superjobs \u2013 that is,\npositions combining tasks once performed by people in two or more traditional\nroles.\n\nVisit SkyWest Airlines\u2019 careers site, and you\u2019ll see that the company is\nlooking for [\u201ccross utilised agents\u201d](https://www.skywest.com/skywest-airline-\njobs/career-guides/cross-utilized-agent/) capable of ticketing, marshalling\nand servicing aircraft, and handling luggage. At online shoe company Zappos,\nwhich famously [did away with job\ntitles](https://www.zappos.com/about/stories/my-time-as-an-intern-2) a few\nyears back, employees are encouraged to take on multiple roles by joining\n\u201ccircles\u201d that tackle different responsibilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you ask Laszlo Bock, Google\u2019s former culture chief and now the head of the\nHR start-up Humu, what he looks for in a new hire, he\u2019ll tell you \u201cmental\nagility\u201d. \u201cWhat companies are looking for,\u201d says Mary Jo King, the president\nof the US National R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Writers\u2019 Association, \u201cis someone who can be all, do\nall, and pivot on a dime to solve any problem\u201d.\n\nThe phenomenon is sped by automation, which usurps routine tasks, leaving\nemployees to handle the non-routine and unanticipated \u2013 and the continued\nadvance of which throws the skills employers value into flux. It would be\nsupremely ironic if the advance of the knowledge economy had the effect of\ndevaluing knowledge. But that\u2019s what I heard, recurrently, while reporting\nthis story.\n\n\u201cThe half-life of skills is getting shorter,\u201d I was told by IBM\u2019s Joanna Daly,\nwho oversaw an apprenticeship program that trained tech employees for new jobs\nwithin the company in as little as six months. By 2020, [a 2016 World Economic\nForum report](http://reports.weforum.org/future-of-\njobs-2016/?doing_wp_cron=1563767850.0794260501861572265625) predicted, more\nthan one-third of the desired core skill sets of most occupations will not\nhave been seen as crucial to the job when the report was published. If that\u2019s\nthe case, I asked John Sullivan, a prominent Silicon Valley talent adviser,\nwhy should anyone take the time to master anything at all? \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t!\u201d he\nreplied.\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nThe US Navy has pushed the idea of generalist staff forward with an abandon\nunseen anywhere on land.  US Navy\n\nAs a rule of thumb, statements out of Silicon Valley should be deflated by\nhalf to control for hyperbole. Still, the ramifications of Sullivan\u2019s comment\nunfurl quickly. Minimal manning \u2013 and the evolution of the economy more\ngenerally \u2013 requires a different kind of worker, with not only different\nacquired skills but different inherent abilities. It has implications for the\nnature and utility of a college education, for the path of careers, for\ninequality and employability \u2013 even for the generational divide. And that\u2019s to\nsay nothing of its potential impact on product quality and worker safety, or\non the nature of the satisfactions one might derive from work. Or, for that\nmatter, on the relevance of the question, What do you want to be when you grow\nup?\n\nHow deep these implications go depends, ultimately, on how closely employers\nembrace the concepts behind minimal manning. The navy, curiously, has pushed\nthe idea forward with an abandon unseen anywhere on land. Within a few years,\n35 littoral combat ships will be afloat, along with three minimally manned\ndestroyers of the new Zumwalt class. The effort seemed to me a good test case\nfor the broader questions bedevilling the economy: Can a few brilliant, quick-\nthinking generalists really replace a fleet of specialists? Is the value of\ntrue expertise in serious decline?\n\nI wanted to try to answer these questions \u2013 which is why, that morning in San\nDiego, I joined the crew of the Giffords as it prepared to set sail.\n\n* * *\n\nA warship is, in the words of [one Navy\nanalysis](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a567261.pdf), a highly\ncomplicated \u201csocio-technical system\u201d. It operates in an environment that is\noften hostile, even outside of war; its crew \u2013 isolated by vast waters \u2013 must\nbe ready for every eventuality. Traditionally, navies handled this by staffing\ntheir ships amply. Spain\u2019s wood-and-sail Sant\u00edsima Trinidad carried upwards of\n1000 men at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, providing redundancy in the face\nof any contingency. If one system failed, there was a back-up. This may not\nhave been efficient, but it was effective. The US Navy adopted that model long\nago \u2013 and has not lost a ship in combat since the Korean War.\n\nBut the end of the draft, in 1973, brought rising labour costs and, with them,\na shift in thinking. \u201cFor my entire 39-year career,\u201d the late Admiral Jeremy\nBoorda said in the early \u201990s, \u201cwe always talked about buying ships and\nmanning them with people \u2026 I think we need to think about things differently\nnow. We need to figure out how to have the fewest number of people possible,\nand then build [ships] to make them as effective as they need to be.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 1995, Boorda converted an ageing cruiser, the USS Yorktown, into an\nexperimental \u201csmart ship\u201d on which watches were combined, engine rooms were\nunmanned, and sailors communicated by handheld radio instead of stationary\ntelephones. The result was promising but modest: a 4 per cent reduction in\ncrew size. A series of naval reports concluded that big dollar savings could\nbe achieved only with more significant changes, including greater automation\nand the selection and training of generalists rather than specialists.\n\n> You have to be adaptable, very adaptable to the circumstances, or things can\n> really take a turn in a different direction.\n>\n> \u2014 Damontrae Butler, Culinary Specialist 2nd Class\n\nThen, in 2001, Donald Rumsfeld arrived at the Pentagon. The new secretary of\ndefence carried with him a briefcase full of ideas from the corporate world:\ndownsizing, re-engineering, transformational technologies. Almost immediately,\nwhat had been an experimental concept became an article of faith. In what\nRonald O\u2019Rourke of the Congressional Research Service has called an analytical\nvirgin birth, the navy committed itself to developing the littoral combat ship\nand the Zumwalt-class destroyer, using the principles of minimal manning. The\nLCS came first, partly because it borrowed an Australian design for a\npassenger ferry and could therefore boost the fleet size quickly.\n\n\u201cI think when the navy started off, they had a really good plan,\u201d Paul\nFrancis, of the US Government Accountability Office, [told the\nSenate](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-114shrg28323/html/CHRG-114shrg28323.htm)\nin 2016. \u201cThey were going to build two ships, experimental ships.\u201d But in\n2005, having assured itself that optimal manning works, the navy decided to\nskip the experimentation and move straight to construction. From this point\non, whenever the navy tried to study the feasibility of minimal manning, its\nanalysis was coloured by the fact that \u2013 on these ships, at least \u2013 it had to\nwork. Dozens of littoral combat ships were on their way. The Giffords was the\n10th to deploy.\n\nAs the skyline of downtown San Diego recedes in the distance, we find\nourselves approaching a pier that lies along the final extremity of land\nbefore the open Pacific. Shimmering far off to the left is Coronado Beach, the\nlegendary training site for Navy SEALs. To the right is the tower of a nuclear\nsubmarine. Our mission for the day is to unload ammunition from the ship to an\nonshore supply base.\n\nOn deck, I spot a man holding a pair of high-tech binoculars and calling out\ndistances: \u201cThree hundred yards. Two hundred yards.\u201d Turns out it is Butler,\nwho, in addition to his other jobs, is working to become a certified lookout.\n\u201cYou have to be adaptable, very adaptable to the circumstances, or things can\nreally take a turn in a different direction,\u201d he tells me, while estimating\nthe distance and bearing of an approaching yacht under the tutelage of another\nsailor. \u201cFor me, that means thinking about the task you\u2019re doing, not the task\nyou\u2019ll have to do.\u201d That is: not dwelling on the garlic bread in the oven.\n\u201cAnd asking the right questions. Uh, 500 yards?\u201d He checks his eyeball\nestimate with the range finder. \u201cFive hundred yards.\u201d\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nOn most navy ships, only a boatswain\u2019s mate \u2013 the oldest of the navy\u2019s 60-odd\noccupations \u2013 would handle the ropes but with minimal manning it becomes one\nof many jobs the crew must master.  US Navy\n\nWhat other jobs does he have? Should a fire break out, Butler says, he would\nbecome a \u201cboundaryman\u201d and work to stop the spread of smoke to other\ncompartments \u2013 a job that, on another ship, would be supervised by a full-time\ndamage-control specialist. The LCS has only two of these \u2013 which is one reason\nit has a \u201csurvivability\u201d rating of 1, the lowest score possible. If the ship\nis critically struck, crew members are expected to simply abandon ship and\nescape. Traditionalists hate the idea.\n\nButler isn\u2019t the only character to reappear in different form. During an all-\nhands meeting \u2013 the smallness of the group exaggerated by the large size of\nthe flight deck they stand on \u2013 someone points to the figure strolling in from\nstage right. It is one of the two boatswain\u2019s mates who has been overseeing\nthe line-handlers that morning. He has swapped his blue coveralls for head-to-\ntoe green camo, and is walking back and forth, appearing to survey the upper\ndeck of the ship. Such costume changes give the whole ship the feel of a small\ntheatre troupe in which the actor playing the prince\u2019s cousin also plays the\napothecary, the friar, and Messenger No. 2.\n\nThe navy knew early on that not just anyone could handle this kind of multi-\ntasking. By the early 2000s, the Office of Naval Research was commissioning\nstudies on how to select and prepare a crew for the new ships. One of the\nacademics brought in was Zachary Hambrick, a psychology professor at Michigan\nState University. Instead of trying to understand how well naval candidates\nmight master fixed skills, Hambrick began to examine how they performed in\nwhat are known as fluid-task environments. \u201cWe wanted to identify\ncharacteristics of people who could flexibly shift,\u201d he says. To that end, in\n2010 he administered a test to sailors at Naval Station Great Lakes \u2013 and when\nI travel to Michigan State to find out more about his work, he invites me to\ngive it a try.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Hambrick\u2019s Expertise Lab, I sit before [a screen divided into\nquadrants](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220014605_The_Relationship_Between_the_ASVAB_and_Multitasking_in_Navy_Sailors_A_Process-\nSpecific_Approach): One shows me a fuel gauge I have to monitor; another\ndisplays a set of letters I have to memorise; another gives me a set of\nnumbers to add together; and the final one is a red button I have to push\nwhenever a high-pitched tone sounds. All four tasks contribute equally to my\ntotal score, which appears at the centre of the screen. Because there really\nis no such thing as multi-tasking \u2013 just a rapid switching of attention \u2013 I\nbegin to feel over-strained, put upon, and finally irked by the impossible set\nof concurrent demands. Shouldn\u2019t someone be giving me a hand here?\n\nThis, Hambrick explains, means I am hitting the limits of working memory \u2013\nbasically, raw processing power \u2013 which is an important aspect of \u201cfluid\nintelligence\u201d and peaks in your early 20s. This is distinct from \u201ccrystallised\nintelligence\u201d \u2013 the accumulated facts and know-how on your hard drive \u2013 which\npeaks in your 50s. In a setting where the possession of know-how is trumped by\nthe ability to acquire it quickly, as in Hambrick\u2019s game, fluid intelligence\nis paramount.\n\nWhen the sailors at Naval Station Great Lakes took the test, they were thrown\na curveball that I was not: in the middle of the test, the scoring system\nsuddenly changed, so that one quadrant now accounted for 75 per cent of the\nscore. Some sailors, Hambrick told me, were quick to spot the change and\nrefocus their attention accordingly. They tended to test high in fluid\nintelligence. Others noticed the change but continued to devote equal\nattention to all four tasks. Their scores fell. This group, Hambrick found,\nwas high in \u201cconscientiousness\u201d \u2013 a trait that\u2019s normally an overwhelming\npredictor of positive job performance. We like conscientious people because\nthey can be trusted to show up early, double-check the maths, fill the gap in\nthe presentation, and return your car gassed up even though the tank was\nnowhere near full to begin with. What struck Hambrick as counter-intuitive and\ninteresting was that conscientiousness here seemed to correlate with poor\nperformance.\n\nJeffery LePine, an Arizona State management professor and former air force\nofficer, was doing navy-funded research on decision making in the late 1990s.\nHe discovered the people who did best on a computer game a lot like the one\nHambrick used tended to score high on \u201copenness to new experience\u201d \u2013 a\npersonality trait that is normally not a major job-performance predictor and\nthat, in certain contexts, roughly translates to \u201cdistractibility\u201d. To borrow\nthe management expert Peter Drucker\u2019s formulation, people with this trait are\nless focused on doing things right, and more likely to wonder whether they\u2019re\ndoing the right things.\n\nHigh in fluid intelligence, low in experience, not terribly conscientious,\nopen to potential distraction \u2013 this is not the classic profile of a winning\njob candidate. But what if it is the profile of the winning job candidate of\nthe future? If that\u2019s the case, some important implications would arise.\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nAboard littoral combat ships, like the Gabrielle Giffords, the crew lacks the\nexpertise to carry out some important tasks, and instead has to rely on\ncivilian help.  AP\n\nOne concerns \u201cgrit\u201d, a mind-set, much vaunted these days in educational and\nprofessional circles, that allows people to commit tenaciously to doing one\nthing well. Angela Duckworth, a University of Pennsylvania psychology\nprofessor, has written powerfully about the value of grit \u2013 putting your head\ndown, blocking out distractions, committing over a course of many years to a\nchosen path. Her writing traces an intellectual lineage that can also be found\nin Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s _Outliers_ , which explains extraordinary success as a\nfunction of endless, dedicated practice: 10,000 hours or more. These ideas are\ninherently appealing; they suggest that dedication can be more important than\nraw talent, that the dogged and conscientious will be rewarded in the end.\n\nIn the stable environments Duckworth and Gladwell draw from (chess, tennis,\npiano, higher education), a rigid adherence to routine can no doubt serve you\nwell. But in situations with rapidly changing rules and roles, a small but\ngrowing body of evidence now suggests that it can leave you ill-equipped.\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see a big shift,\u201d says Guy Halfteck, a people-analytics\nexpert. Employers are looking less at what you know and more and more at your\nhidden potential to learn new things. His advice to employers? Stop hiring\npeople [based on their work\nexperience](https://www.afr.com/leadership/workplace/want-to-hire-better-\nworkers-chuck-out-the-cvs-20190705-p524of). Because in these environments,\nexpertise can become an obstacle. That was the finding of a 2015 study carried\nout by the Yale researchers Matthew Fisher and Frank Keil, titled \u201c[The Curse\nof Expertise](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26369299)\u201d. The more we\ninvest in building and embellishing a system of knowledge, they found, the\nmore averse we become to unbuilding it.\n\nYet the limitations of curious, fluidly intelligent groups of generalists\nquickly become apparent in the real world. The devaluation of expertise opens\nup ample room for different sorts of mistakes \u2013 and sometimes creates a kind\nof helplessness.\n\nAboard littoral combat ships, the crew lacks the expertise to carry out some\nimportant tasks, and instead has to rely on civilian help. A malfunctioning\ncrane on board one LCS, for example, meant that the crew had to summon an\nexpert to solve the problem, and then had to wait four days for him to arrive.\n\nThere have been other incidents. Because of a design flaw, the LCS [engines\nstarted to corrode](https://www.wired.com/2011/06/shipbuilder-blames-navy-as-\nbrand-new-warship-disintegrates/) not long after the fleet\u2019s launch, but for a\nlong time nobody on board noticed, which led to costly delays and repairs.\nWhen a congressional oversight committee found out about the problem in 2011,\nit called the ships\u2019 crews to task. Who was in charge of checking the engines?\nThe answer was \u2026 nobody. The engine rooms were unmanned by design.\n\nMeanwhile, the modular \u201cplug and fight\u201d configuration was not panning out as\nhoped. Converting a ship from sub hunter to minesweeper or minesweeper to\nsurface combatant, it turned out, was a logistical nightmare. Variants of all\nthree \u201cmission packages\u201d had to be stocked at far-flung ports; an extra\ndetachment of 20-plus sailors had to stand ready to embark with each. More to\nthe point, in order to enable quick mastery by generalists, the technologies\non each had to be user-friendly \u2013 which they were not. So in 2016 the concept\nof interchangeability was scuttled for a \u201cone ship, one mission\u201d approach, in\nwhich the extra 20-plus sailors became permanent crew members.\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nAs the cost of computing continues to fall and artificial intelligence usurps\nmore and more human competencies, the collapse of old jobs into new ones seems\npreferable to their total disappearance.  US Navy\n\nIn 2016, a chastened naval command quietly ordered all LCSs to stand down for\nseveral months, sent their engineering crews back to school for\nrequalification, and bulked up its high-tech courseware, which lets LCS\ntrainees practise tasks on a highly detailed virtual ship. Onboard routines\nwere updated to include more oversight and double-checking. The ship passed\nits sea trials, but not with flying colours.\n\n\u201cAs equipment breaks, [sailors] are required to fix it without any training,\u201d\na Defense Department Test and Evaluation employee told Congress. \u201cThose are\nnot my words. Those are the words of the sailors who were doing the best they\ncould to try to accomplish the missions we gave them in testing.\u201d The\nintentionally small crew size made the ship ill-suited to forward combat,\nbecause not enough people were on board to stand watch.\n\nThese results were, perhaps, predictable given the navy\u2019s initial, full-\nthrottle approach to minimal manning \u2013 and are an object lesson on the dangers\nof embracing any radical concept without thinking hard enough about the\ndownsides. Even if minimal manning works for a given business or institution,\nthe ramifications for society may not be entirely salubrious. Grit and 10,000\nhours of training are appealing in part because they reinforce American self-\nconceptions that have been present since the country\u2019s founding, ideas about\nequality of opportunity, about the value of knowledge, about the importance of\nhard work. And while no one would suggest that effort itself is being devalued\ntoday \u2013 hard work is just as important in the workplace that\u2019s emerging as in\nthe one that\u2019s receding \u2013 a world in which mental agility and raw cognitive\nspeed eclipse hard-won expertise is a world of greater exclusion: of older\nworkers, slower learners, and the less socially adept.\n\n\u201cThis sounds absurd,\u201d retired Vice-Admiral Pete Daly (now head of the US Naval\nInstitute) says, \u201cbut if you keep going down this road, you end up with one\nreally expensive ship with just a few people on it who are geniuses \u2026 That\u2019s\nnot a future we want to see, because you need a large enough crew to conduct\nmultiple tasks in combat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s a future we may need to see. As the cost of computing continues to\nfall and artificial intelligence usurps more and more human competencies, the\ncollapse of old jobs into new ones seems preferable to their total\ndisappearance.\n\nAnd while it seems fair to say that the navy pushed the LCS forward too hard\nand too heedlessly, calling its minimal-manning project a failure would be\npremature. The viability of the aircraft carrier was not obvious to military\nplanners in the 1920s, but then, through an extended process of on-site trial\nand error, engineers added catapults and arresting wires, and reconfigured\nflight decks, all of which turned an interesting idea into reality.\n\n* * *\n\nWhat does all this mean for those of us in the workforce, and those of us\nplanning to enter it? It would be wrong to say that the 10,000-hours-of-\ndeliberate-practice idea doesn\u2019t hold up at all. In some situations, it\nclearly does. Sports, musicianship, teaching \u2013 these are fields where the\nrules don\u2019t change much over time. In medicine and law, the rules might change\n\u2013 but specialisation will probably remain key. Spinal surgery will not be\nperformed by a brilliant dermatologist. A criminal-defence team will not be\nheaded by a tax attorney. And in tech, the demand for specialised skills will\ncontinue to reward expertise handsomely.\n\nBut in many fields the path to success isn\u2019t so clear. The rules keep\nchanging, which means that highly focused practice has a much lower return.\nZachary Hambrick and his co-authors showed as much in a 2014 meta-analysis. In\nuncertain environments, Hambrick says, specialisation is no longer the coin of\nthe realm.\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nIn medicine and law, the rules might change \u2013 but specialisation will probably\nremain key.

It leaves us with lifelong learning, an\nunavoidably familiar phrase that, before I began this story, sounded tame to\nme \u2013 a motivational reminder that it\u2019s never too late to learn Spanish or\nenrol in night-time pottery classes. But when Guillermo Miranda, IBM\u2019s former\nchief learning officer, used the term in describing to me how employees take\nadvantage of the company\u2019s automated career counsellor, Myca, it started to\nsound like something new. \u201cYou can talk to the chatbot,\u201d Miranda says, \u201cand\nsay, \u2018Hey, Myca, how do I get a promotion?\u2019\u201d\n\nMyca isn\u2019t programmed to push any fixed career track. It isn\u2019t dumb enough to\ntry to predict the future \u2013 much less plan for it. \u201cThere is no master plan,\u201d\nMiranda says. Myca just crunches data, notices correlations, and offers\nsuggestions: take a course on blockchain. Learn quantum computing. \"Look,\nJennifer!\" it might say. \"Three people like you just got promoted because they\ngot these badges.\"\n\n* * *\n\nThe ship\u2019s bridge is quiet on the way home. As we sail, I think back to an\nencounter I\u2019d had earlier in the day with two engineer\u2019s mates. I\u2019d found them\nin a quiet corner of the cargo bay, testing water samples pulled from the\nship\u2019s engines for signs of corrosion. We'd struck up a conversation, and they\nexplained to me that their responsibilities also included maintaining the\nship\u2019s gas turbines, diesel engines, water jets, and various pumps \u2013 for oil,\nfuel, drinking water. I told them that sounded like a lot. They agreed, but\nthen one of them added that doing so many things was just the way things go in\nthis LCS business. Not only that, he added, but he was learning so much that\nhe might soon earn a promotion that would put him up on the bridge, in charge\nof the whole propulsion system.\n\nEverybody I meet on the Giffords seems to share that mentality. They regard\nevery minute on board \u2013 even during a routine transit back to port in San\nDiego Harbour \u2013 as a chance to learn something new. Which is why, near the end\nof our trip, as we approach the Coronado Bridge, Captain Cowan gives the helm\nto a junior officer and asks her to steer us under the bridge and into port.\nThe officer looks intently at the nozzles of the ship\u2019s four water jets, takes\nin the sight of the approaching bridge, and says, \u201cVery well, Captain.\u201d\n\nThen she adjusts her course.\n\n _Atlantic_\n\n\u2014 Atlantic\n\nSave\n\nLog in or\n[Subscribe](https://subscribe.afr.com/?promote_channel=HI_AFR_GNL_HL&utm_source=afr.com&utm_medium=HouseInventory&utm_campaign=General&utm_content=HDR)\nto save article\n\nShare\n\nPrint article\n\n### Read More\n\n  * [Jobs](/topic/jobs-5yw)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n  * [Careers](/topic/careers-645)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n  * [Weekend Fin](/topic/weekend-fin-1mub)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n## [Latest Stories](/latest)\n\n  * [Coronavirus pandemic](/topic/coronavirus-pandemic-1ndb)\n\n### [Johnson 'stable' in ICU, but confusion on next\nmove](/world/europe/johnson-stable-in-icu-but-confusion-on-next-\nmove-20200408-p54iay)\n\nDominic Raab has cast doubt on whether the coronavirus lockdown will be\nreviewed next week, amid growing questions over who is going to make key\ndecisions while the Prime Minister remains in intensive care.\n\n  * 1 min ago\n\n  * [Coronavirus pandemic](/topic/coronavirus-pandemic-1ndb)\n\n### [Houseparty review: drinks with mates, without the threat of jail\ntime](/life-and-luxury/health-and-wellness/houseparty-review-drinks-with-\nmates-without-the-threat-of-jail-time-20200407-p54hot)\n\nHouseparty promises the sort of catch-up drinks that would get you jail time\nin the time of COVID-19.

Sector](https://mk0digitallearn7ttjx.kinstacdn.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/cover-story-img.jpg)\n\n__Share __Tweet [__Share](whatsapp://send?text=Top Emerging Technologies in\nEducation Sector https://digitallearning.eletsonline.com/2019/07/top-emerging-\ntechnologies-in-education-sector/) __Share\n\n\ud83d\udd0a Listen to this Article\n\nEmerging technologies in education revolutionise the way students and teachers\nwork and interact by eliminating the challenges and understanding the needs,\nobserves **Akash Tomer** of **Elets News Network (ENN).**\n\nRecent advancements in Educational Technology (Ed-Tech) are nothing short of\namazing. The developments that have emerged in this field are empowering\neducators to create remarkable learning experiences for today\u2019s young minds.\n\nNow, the education field looms on the horizon of positive disruption. New\ntechnologies promise to make it easier and faster for students to learn.\n\nExplaining about how technology is helpful in education, **Sahil Aggarwal, CEO\n& Co-Founder, Rishihood University**, said, \u201cTechnology has become an enabler\nin democratising education. 21st century will witness a disruption in\nlearning\u201d.\n\n**Emerging Education and Tech Trends**\n\nA recent poll revealed that 75% of educators believe that digital content will\nreplace textbooks by the year 2026, and there are more remarkable technologies\non the way. In fact, choosing which innovations to bring into the classroom is\nsomewhat of a challenge for educators.\n\nStudents in the classrooms of tomorrow can look forward to working with\nexciting resources, such as robotic kits that educators used to teach coding.\nAlso, educators have grown weary of traditional standardized testing\nframeworks. Now, digital testing is emerging as an empowering resource that\nallows educators to track student performance and measure learning improvement\nover time. Furthermore, institutions can leverage Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nto develop customized student learning solutions based on test results.\n\nSharing his thoughts on usage of technology in education, **Dr B Sendilkumar,\nDean & Director- Health Sciences, Vinayaka Mission\u201ds Research Foundation-\nDeemed to be University**, said, \u201cThe 21st century will witness the\ndemocratization of learning. Anyone can teach and anyone can learn. In this\nera, learning will be available to everyone, everywhere, and all the time. The\nmost important skill to develop will be the ability to learn. Fast learners\nwill outpace machines and fellow humans, and educators will need to improve\nthe learning ability of their students.\u201d\n\n**Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality:** Augmented reality in education can\nserve a number of purposes. It helps the students easily acquire, process, and\nremember the information. Additionally, AR makes learning itself more engaging\nand fun. It is also not limited to a single age group or level of education,\nand can be used equally well in all levels of schooling; from preschool\neducation up to college, or even at work.\n\n#### **Augmented reality in education can serve a number of purposes. It helps\nthe students easily acquire, process, and remember the information.\nAdditionally, AR makes learning itself more engaging and fun**\n\nVirtual Reality is the term used to describe a three-dimensional, computer-\ngenerated environment which can be explored and interacted with by a person.\nThat person becomes part of this virtual world or is immersed within this\nenvironment and whilst there, is able to manipulate objects or perform a\nseries of actions. VR implies a complete immersion experience that shuts out\nthe physical world. Example, instead of having a classroom setting being\ntaught about History, students can be taken virtually back in time and see\nevents unfold in front of them.\n\n**Arpan Stephen, E-Learning Expert - Medical Education**, explained the\nimportance of AR, VR and other technologies in education, he said, \u201cAugmented\nand Virtual Reality is a game changer in educational pedagogy. It changes the\nway we learn, providing experiential learning by simulating real world\nenvironment. AR and VR increases student engagement drastically by providing\nthem insight to what they will experience in various environments. We all are\nvisual learners and this technology is one of the most powerful one to\novercome learning challenges by bringing students as close as possible to\nreality.\u201d\n\n**Artificial Intelligence:** The academic world is becoming more convenient\nand personalised thanks to the numerous applications of AI for education. This\nhas changed the way people learn since educational materials are becoming\naccessible to all through smart devices and computers. Today, students don\u2019t\nneed to attend physical classes to study as long as they have computers and\ninternet connection. AI is also allowing the automation of administrative\ntasks, allowing institutions to minimize the time required to complete\ndifficult tasks so that the educators can spend more time with students.\n\n**Machine Learning:** Machine learning is a subset of [**Artificial\nIntelligence**](https://digitallearning.eletsonline.com/2019/03/is-artificial-\nintelligence-redefining-women-power/) (AI) that helps computers or teaching\nmachines learn from all previous data and make intelligent decisions. In the\nfield of education, teachers can save time in their non-classroom activities\nby adopting machine learning. For example, teachers can use virtual assistants\nwho work remotely from the home for their students. This kind of assistance\nhelps to enhance students\u2019 learning experience and can improve progression and\nstudent achievement.\n\n**The Internet of Things is indeed transforming the education sector and\nmaking learning simpler, faster and safer. Common barriers to education like\nGeography, language, Disability can cease to exist with the help of these\ntechnologies.**\n\n**Cloud:** Cloud computing is a buzzing word now-a-days in ICT industry. It\nmeans delivery of computing resources over the internet. It has opened a wider\naspect of computing application and provides a global platform for people. It\nis helpful for every sector from enterprise usage to educational purpose.\nTraditional classroom (Four walled) seems to be less used in the future.\nStudents will be much benefited. Institutes of weak financial state can have\nhigh computing facilities within low cost.\n\n**STEM:** STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.\nSTEM is important because it pervades every part of our lives. Science is\neverywhere in the world around us. Technology is continuously expanding into\nevery aspect of our lives. Engineering is the basic designs of roads and\nbridges,and also tackles the challenges of changing global weather and\nenvironmentally-friendly changes to our home. Mathematics is in every\noccupation, every activity we do in our lives\n\n**IoT:** The Internet of Things is indeed transforming the education sector\nand making learning simpler, faster and safer. Common barriers to education\nlike Geography, language, Disability can cease to exist with the help of these\ntechnologies. However, this is just the beginning and we have just started\nscratching the surface of what technology-based education can look like in the\nfuture.\n\n**Smart Interactive Display Solutions:** Gone are the days when teachers wrote\nthings on chalkboards as a means of displaying lessons to students. The\noverhead projector is even becoming extinct. Instead, schools are making use\nof large, interactive displays like SMART Boards and innovative projectors.\nInteractive display makes it easier for students to use devices to participle\nin class surveys, quizzes, and games, then analyse results in real time.\nAdoption of these projectors has eliminated the classroom walls.\n\n**Learning Management System:** A learning management system is a server-based\nor cloud based software program. It contains information about users, courses\nand content. A learning management system provides a place to learn and teach\nwithout depending on the time and space boundaries. Learning management\nsystems are also known as Course Management Systems (CMS), Personal learning\nEnvironment (PLE), e-learning courseware and Virtual learning Environments\n(VLE).\n\n**Learning Apps:** In the last few years, technology has changed the way of\nteaching and learning. Now education is no more restricted to lectures, talks\nand physical objects, as digitization has overcome this pattern of study.\nTrendy and engaging apps are likely to rule over the boring education pattern\nin future. Students are also showing their interest as the mobile app allows\nthem to learn through gamification. Undoubtedly, the results are superb by\ncombining education and technology for effective learning\n\n**Assessment Solutions:** The Assessment Solutions are tools to help teachers\nand students better understand the steps needed to improve the learning\noutcomes. By following this process teachers can learn what his/her students\nneed to know and what change they need to embrace to improve their teaching\nmethodologies. While designing an assessment solution, both teachers and\nstudents must collaborate to understand needs and a list of possible criteria.\n\n**Gamification:** A game-based learning is about crafting the content around\ngame-story. The students may create their own games or play other commercial\nvideo games. On the other hand, gamification is about shaping the game around\neducational context. Gamification operates on the assumption that the\nengagement experienced by the gamer should be translated to the learning\ncontext. This would eventually influence the behavior of student while\nfacilitating learning at the same time.\n\n**Payment Gateway:** Paying fees for school, university or applying for a\ncourse is time consuming, as students or their parents have to visit the\neducational institutes or nodal centers and stand in queues to make payments.\nThe time and money spent in paying fee can be used more productively. With\ndigital payments, cash based fee payments will be a pass\u00e9. With online and\nmobile payments students will be able to pay at their convenience, remotely\nand in smaller installments. These types of payments are not only restricted\nto debit and credit card users, but the unbanked people using mobile money\nservices such as Airtel Money, M-PESA, EcoCash, Orange Money and Mobicash are\nalso able to make digital payments using feature phone.\n\nThe idea of implementing technology in the classroom is not new. However,\ntechnology has taken off in the classroom in relatively recent years. As the\nfield matures, emerging firms promise to deliver exciting new resources for\nlearners. While the direction of EdTech is unclear, analysts forecast that\nthis promising field is in its very early beginnings.\n\nNo doubt, all education will continue to be valuable and necessary. Students\nand people will need to continue to adapt to technology, continue to want to\nlearn, and continue to stay motivated in their own self-development\n\n>

How has Microsoft upped its\ngame with Azure Bot Service?**\n\nRS: At Microsoft, we help companies develop intelligent, enterprise-grade bots\nthat allow them to maintain control of their data that runs on our Azure\nplatform and is powered by AI. Since we understand that every company has\nvarying business needs, we thus help them build bots suitable to their\nrequirement, ranging from a Q&A bot to their own branded virtual assistant.\nMicrosoft offers open-source SDK and tools to easily connect the bots across\npopular channels and devices.We have recently offered our Azure Bot service to\nFuture General Life Insurance Ltd to help them an AI based chatbot,\n[_REVA_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/campaign/artificial-\nintelligence/alforall-awards.aspx) , for its life insurance business on the\ncompany\u2019s website. The chatbot addresses two business requirements viz.,\ncustomer service and new customer acquisition and onboarding. Through a one-\nclick service, existing customers can get policy status, premium due date,\nrenewal payments, request for a soft copy of unit statement, premium paid\ncertificate, fund charges among others. The AI based chatbot has helped the\nbusiness improve customer satisfaction scores by 91%, promoter customers by\n70% and renewal premiums by 50%.\n\n* *

About things which can kill me,\nembarrass me or cost me a lot of money, I am obsessive in making sure they\ndon\u2019t happen. Yet there we were on the runway, with the gear switch in the\nretracted position.\n\nOh, the humanity! After this sentence, you can scroll down to the comments and\nbash me for a nakedly click baitish headline. The gear-up landing was\n_virtual_ since I was flying the new Cirrus TRAC, which has a landing gear\n\u201csimulator\u201d to train budding students to remember to slap the wheels down\nbefore landing. Still, I had forgotten to go through the motions of doing\nthat, even though I believe in that sort of thing. Didn\u2019t even think of it\nlong enough to cognitively acknowledge to myself that the switch was there but\nI didn\u2019t need to use it. No foul, but sloppy by my standards.\n\nAs detailed in [this week\u2019s video](https://www.avweb.com/multimedia/avweb-\nflight-trial-cirrus-trac-trainer/), I flew the TRAC with Cirrus\u2019 SR program\nmanager, Ivy Mciver. (She also landed gear up, I hasten to add. I found the\nswitch up when I settled into the right seat.) Cirrus is making a run at the\ntraining market with an SR20 configured as the ideal flight trainer. But in a\nworld where airplanes seem an afterthought whose function is just to ferry\naround tarted up avionics, what _is_ the ideal trainer?\n\nI\u2019ve been asked this before and recently discussed it in a panel\npresentation\u2014well, a faux debate really\u2014at Redbird\u2019s Migration conference in\nDenver in October. My off-the-cuff reply was that the best trainer is one of\nmodern design, with modern avionics and a center stick. If you think I had\nDiamond\u2019s DA40 in mind, you\u2019d be right. In retrospect, that\u2019s risibly\nsimplistic and if I gave it more thought, it would probably be just as\nsimplistic given my tendency toward being a simpleton.\n\nWhen most of us think about what a trainer airplane should be, we veer toward\nthings like stability, practicality, affordability, a decent climb rate to\nrecover from stalls and maybe cabin size. But to big flight schools like\nEmbry-Riddle or the University of North Dakota, three things top the list of\nideal trainers: Economics, economics and economics. That\u2019s a gross\nexaggeration for editorial effect, but the dollar numbers loom large for big\nschools. They care about what the airplane costs, what it costs to operate and\nhow reliably it can be dispatched to fly day in and day out, eight hours a day\nwithout unpredictable AOG. For smaller schools, affordability may be an even\nbigger driver.\n\nBut what about how the airplane behaves in flight? Stall characteristics? How\nit lands? Cockpit visibility? Yeah sure, but not if the thing breaks a lot or\nit has some peculiarity that generates big-dollar recurring costs. Although it\nhappened a decade ago, some schools still smart from troubles they had with\nDiamond\u2019s Thielert-powered DA42, even though they otherwise liked the\nairplane.\n\nSmaller schools might not be quite so hard over on dispatch reliability, but\nthey sure can\u2019t afford to have maintenance downs that keep them from flying\nand renting airplanes. That alone explains why the venerable Skyhawk and Piper\nPA-28 are such favorites. They may be boring as hell, but they\u2019re predictably\nboring as hell.\n\nPhilosophically and technically, do the flight characteristics of a trainer\neven matter? On the one hand, if you train a student in a nice-flying, benign\ndesign like the aforementioned DA40, have you then preloaded the student not\nto be able to handle something weird in a like airplane or just a weird\nairplane? And if you train someone in something harder to fly\u2014like my Cub\u2014can\nthey now fly _anything_ or just airplanes with ambiguous trim and pitch\ncharacteristics, a ton of adverse yaw and imaginary brakes? Does that make the\ngirl a better pilot? And someone eventually more capable in the left seat of\nthe shiny new recertified 737 MAX?\n\nAt the Denver conference, my friend Dave Hirschman insisted that in his world,\nhe would put the student in a taildragger flying off a turf runway until solo.\nWell, that\u2019s good, I suppose, if that person will be flying taildraggers off\ngrass runways. But what does it have to do with flying a 180,000-pound jet\ntransport? I\u2019ve asked one of our contributors who flies one those _and_ little\nairplanes for his take on stick and rudder carry through. So far, he hasn\u2019t\ncome up with anything.\n\nAlthough I fly \u2018em and love \u2018em, I\u2019ve never bought the theory that\ntaildraggers pilots are \u201creal\u201d pilots or somehow better. They\u2019re just\ntaildragger pilots. When I get into a modern tailwheel airplane, like a Carbon\nCub, say, I screw up the first landings same as anybody else. I sometimes get\na by because people know I own a Cub and then I immediately demonstrate I\ndon\u2019t deserve such consideration. And anyway, good tailwheel skills are\nperishable. If you haven\u2019t confronted an angry crosswind in one in, say, a\nyear, it ain\u2019t like riding a bicycle unless your idea of riding a bicycle is\nexploring a roadside ditch.\n\nWhen I canvassed some of the major schools about what they want in a trainer,\nthings like stalls, slow flight characteristics and cruise speed didn\u2019t pop up\nas bright radar targets. But things you wouldn\u2019t think about did. The\nUniversity of North Dakota\u2019s Jeremy Roesler told me the school is tilting away\nfrom Cessnas and back to Pipers because they limit the Cessnas to 25 knots of\nwind, but the Cherokissers are good for 30. And that\u2019s not a flying\nconsideration, but taxiing on icy ramps, which they obviously do a lot of.\nJust as an aside, being confident taxiing in an Arctic vortex is, in my view,\nevery bit as critical a skill as twaddling with an FMS. Maybe more.\n\nHangarage is a thing, too. Roesler told me the school really likes the Diamond\naircraft, but they\u2019re long of wing and students have to put all the airplanes\naway at night in a large group hangar. Short wings are a plus for that.\nPurdue\u2019s Brian Dillman told me they tried Cirrus SR20s for a fleet cycle, but\nfound them too heavy to muscle into the T-hangars they store the airplanes in.\nComplicating it was more complex maintenance on the SR20s, which Cirrus may\nencounter as a barrier for some schools.\n\nAt the moment, the trainer market is hot, but not red hot. One new design is\nafoot, Piper\u2019s Pilot 100. It\u2019s a low-cost entry, that\u2019s as much as $150,000\ncheaper than the competition. Nice idea, says Florida Institute of\nTechnology\u2019s Isaac Silver. But the Pilot 100 has a new, untried\nengine\u2014Continental\u2019s Prime IO-370\u2014and Silver says low price or not, schools\nwill think twice before they throw over a known entity like Lycoming\u2019s IO-360\nfor an unproven powerplant. No one likes maintenance surprises, least of all\nflight schools.\n\nI was at Diamond Aircraft last week flying the DA40 NG diesel, which is\nselling briskly, despite a near half-million dollar sticker. Diamond has\nnoticed the price of used DA20s has almost doubled so they\u2019re cranking up the\nline to build new ones. That airplane is a proven design and a good performer\nwith the Continental IO-240. It\u2019s fun, easy to fly and reliable. Evidently,\nwith Skyhawks north of $440K, schools are rediscovering it, otherwise the used\nprices wouldn\u2019t be climbing.\n\nIt has warts, of course, as all airplanes do. But if all you need to do\ninitially is get the student to understand the relationship of the stick to\nthe size of houses, do you need an acre of TFT glory to pull that off?\n\nIt a bright shining moment of stop the madness, I\u2019m gonna go with no.\n\n*With apologies to [Cheryl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ffs4gSJjjV4).\n\n#### Other AVwebflash Articles\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/5b6e71b3fc7e9306728b4632-100x70.jpg)](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-\nnews/faa-loses-air-traffic-routing-suit/ \"FAA Loses Air Traffic Routing Suit\")\n\n### [FAA Loses Air Traffic Routing Suit](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-\nnews/faa-loses-air-traffic-routing-suit/ \"FAA Loses Air Traffic Routing Suit\")\n\n[Aviation Law](https://www.avweb.com/topics/aviation-news/aviation-law/)\nDecember 15, 2019\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/TRAC_Air-to-\nAir_03042019-100x70.jpg)](https://www.avweb.com/insider/well-it-finally-\nhappened-zachary-i-landed-gear-up/ \"Well It Finally Happened Zachary.

December 16, 2019 at 1:40 pm\n\nThere is no one size fits all aircraft trainer.\n\nPart of the problem is the end game of the flight school. If the flight school\nis a local school intended to be focused on getting those interested in\ncompleting a private pilot's license, the training requirements would be\ndifferent than for a school whose students are destined for the heavies. The\nprimary basic fight training knowledge needed to gain the PPL is the same, but\ngoing from the PPL to commercial, to instrument, to multi-engine, to ATP\nratings require a different combination of skills, therefore a combination of\nairplanes.\n\nWhen tasked with flight training for mission aviators, we found a very good\ncombination\u2026including meeting the three most critical components, economics,\neconomics, and economics. Primary to solo was the venerable 0-200 Cessna 150.\nAfter solo, the airplane we used to complete the commercial and instrument\nrequirements was a Grumman Tiger (with the obligatory short time use of a\nborrowed Arrow for the commercial check ride meeting complex requirements at\nthat time). We accomplished this with average density altitudes of 3-7,000ft,\nlots of wind, and T-storm activity 8 months out of the year. There were times\nwe could fly the Tiger but not the 150 because of taxi issues of the lighter,\nhigh wing 150. But navigating the Tiger in a 25-30 knot cross-wind to get to\nthe active runway required some skill, too. The end game for the missionary\naviator was 500 hrs PIC, Instrument and Commercial ratings, along with an A&P\nlicense. To accomplish the last requirement, the students worked on the\nmodification of the Cessna 182's which included an 0-520, 3.5 ft wing\nextensions, HD nose fork, leading edge cuff, seaplane V-brace, baggage\nextension, 100 gallons of fuel, seating for 6,and an interesting mix of\navionics. These modified 182's were the airplane the student turned mission\naviators would eventually fly. They were/are the backbone of our mission\nfleet.\n\nTo subsidize this activity, we trained local students who were just interested\nin getting a PPL. We used the same basic training regime with the C150 and\nTiger. In the 8 years we did both, we had no failed check-rides, and 100%\ncompletion rates of those seeking PPL for recreation/business flying or those\nwho went into the mission aviation field \u2026with advanced ratings.\n\nWhat we learned in flight training:  \nThe 150 taught the basics of flying, flying on the wing, in hot, bumpy\nconditions, in an environment of what an airplane feels like to be at gross\nweight all the time. The Tiger taught airspeed control, stabilized approaches,\nresponsive controls, and with the free swiveling nose gear, what the pedals on\nthe floor are for. Every student was exposed to grass runways, smooth asphalt,\nwide and skinny runways, and non-towered and towered fields including an\ninternational airport. These airplanes, gave the combined skills needed to\nmake transitioning to a 3200lb gross weight Skylane very easy and smooth for\nthe mission aviator. For the the others, many of our students became high-\nperformance aircraft owners with similar transition ease.\n\nWhat we learned about maintenance and flight school business requirements:  \nBoth airplanes were very reliable. The fiberglass gear of the Tiger was every\nbit as durable as the 150's spring gear. The bonded construction was every bit\nas durable as all metal construction. One issue that became prevalent is how\nmuch wear one contributes to the airplane when even the most simple airplane\nis going through repeated 100 inspections. Properly opening and closing an\nairplane for an annual/100 hr inspection contributes to a lot of additional\nmaintenance on interior components, inspection panels, cowlings, and\nengine/exhaust components/plumbing. In some cases we were doing 100 hr\ninspections 3-5 times a year on both airplanes.\n\nPushing around the Tiger and 150 was easy and damage free. The wingspan and\nweight make a difference on productivity. Trying to man-handle a 182 with a\nnow 39\u2032 8\u2033 wingspan, an additional foot taller because of the big\nwheels/tires, and higher empty weight, plus larger fuel capacity often\nrequired a minimum of two people, and preferably a tug or mechanical\nassistance of some sort. Plus, the longer than standard wing contributed to\nstorage issues and hangar rash.\n\nThe total initial investment in the two airplanes, both IFR equipped, was $80K\nduring our start up in 2004. We survived the 2008-2009 economic crisis to\ncontinue through 2012 profitably when our contract with the mission operation\nended. No one got rich but we paid our bills.\n\nUnless the Cirrus is put on a diet, I believe it is too heavy for average\nsmall flight schools. That 600lbs extra weight makes a big difference when\nmoving, parking, and storing. Try hanging on to a Cirrus tow bar when pushing\nbackwards, even with assistance. Access to items needed to be checked or\nreplace during annual inspections is not particularly easy which contributes\nto increase wear on the entire airplane just to do the required\nmaintenance/inspection. CAPS maintenance is expensive. Plus, with all the\navionics, CAPS and unique electrical demands, combined with the composite\nconstruction requires a top notch avionics tech and A&P with working knowledge\nof composites/CAPS. Plus, depending on the state, special licensing\nrequirements to handle the CAPS explosive cartridges. Even simple paint touch\nups are not really simple on a composite airplane. This includes the Diamond.\n\nWingspan makes a big difference on moving and storage. This is an issue to be\nconsidered with Diamond aircraft. Today, we have Rotax engines, FADEC,\ndifferent ignition systems, diesels, even unique ground equipment all\nrequiring specialized maintenance training. All of this has to be accounted\nfor in addition to purchase costs.\n\nI believe most flight training discussions are intended for the expansion of\nthe professional pilot population. The smaller schools will do what we did\nbuying used airplanes that we could reasonably, affordably ( that is a\ncontradiction of terms in aviation) purchase. So, the Cirrus or Diamond, with\nthe proper maintenance support needed, paid for by the higher hourly costs and\nsubsidized by the airlines has a place in the training fleet. Not for the\nsmaller schools.\n\nAdding a speed brake to the belly when the \"gear\" is down to slow the airplane\ndown and add some shake could duplicate the similar feeling with a real\nretractable. With out that similar feel, many more will land \"gear up\" as Paul\ndid, with no consequences. Had a speed brake on the belly been added with the\nattending shake, speed, and pitch changes, I doubt if Paul would have\n\"forgotten\". Just a handle with lights and an option to simulate a gear issue\nis no substitute. Practice trying to hand fly a Bonanza, C210, Arrow,\nComanche, light twin, etc when having to hand crank the gear down, deal with\nthe extended pitch changes that the pilot is subjected to in this long\nprocess, manage the prop/engine/flaps, and not stall the airplane or over-\nspeed the gear/flap placards. Add to the mix, maybe you are in the clag.\n\nThere is something to be said for simplicity and standard construction\ntechniques that are more available within the maintenance community. It does\nseem the training requirements for flying professionally is geared toward\nprogramming the FMS, understanding and operating the sensory overload\navailable with modern avionics, and prevention of flight extremes from\nhappening altogether, than basic stick and rudder skills. Not saying that\nthese environments are promoting poor pilots. Dealing smoothly and effectively\nwith the all the avionics has to offer provides a lot of prevention of loss of\ncontrol while fiddling in turbulence with a touch screen panel. Also knowing\nhow to push the buttons can contribute to more heads out of the cockpit\nflying.\n\nHowever, I do wonder and question the pilot abilities when the\npredictability/familiarity is lost, and now, basic skills needed to be\nimplemented with understanding of on-board systems at the same time. Such\nskills as demonstrated by notables such as Haynes/crew and Sullenberger/Skiles\nare required under the extremes of an emergency. Those two accidents were\nhandled by extraordinary skilled aviators whose combined teamwork and primary\nskills were previously acquired because of interest in different flight\nregimes other than heavies.\n\nAircraft manufactures who successfully manufacture at a profit, a trainer or\nseries of trainers that meets the varied requirements of the particular flight\nschool including economics will rise to the top. Having a\nCessna150/172/172RG/310 or a Piper Cherokee/Warrier/Archer/Arrow/Seneca\ncombination did promote brand loyalty and expose the student to a wide range\nof flight requirements and aircraft. Those trained that way are largely the\npeople flying our airliners today. Students exposed to primarily one airplane\ndesigned to be multi-purpose trainers could be potentially shortchanged when\nit comes to different handling quirks and more complex systems. Under those\nrare but extraordinary circumstances when MCAS fails, an engine failure\ndestroys all the flight controls, or you have a 500,000+ pound glider, is the\none size fits all program the most effective? And other than a trainer with\nCAPS, there is no other alternative other than sheer flying skills to\nnegotiate a safe outcome. Time will tell.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fwell-it-finally-\nhappened-zachary-i-landed-gear-up%2F)\n\n    * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/470f3c99cd8a5b26908caaeeaf6c9b7a?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Mark F.

A dumb old used P or C brand boat of an airframe is almost perfect\nfor this niche. Get your certificate and THEN learn to fly.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fwell-it-finally-\nhappened-zachary-i-landed-gear-up%2F)\n\n  13. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6322bd68bece4e6e332dbc73f8888b99?s=50&d=mm&r=g) YARS .

Now he's crafty and cunning, too.\n\nNow he writes a blog where I -- subsequently, after re-reading the article\ntwice -- notice that there's an asterisk in the Title and I have to comb to\nthe bottom (he did say that) to find a link to a YouTube video I have to click\non and then pay attention to to figure out that \"Zachary\" is Cheryl's\ninsurance agent and the reason for the asterisk and title. (I'm still trying\nto figure out what an insurance agent and a burning She Shed has to do with a\nlanding gear simulator switch but \u2026 I'm slow that way). Connecting the dots\nUSED to be SO much simpler. Cute!\n\nAnd then he figures out a way to put some 'zing' into the old adage that\npulling back on the stick makes the houses get smaller. Never too late to\nimprove upon old adages, I say.\n\nFinally, during one of my re-reads to solve the puzzle, I notice there's a\nquiet embedded link to \"This Week's Video.\" I thought there was supposed to be\na picture (you know \u2026 they're worth 1,000 words) to bait me into watching. I\nwent back to see if there was one on the web page and there wasn't. I'm SO\nconfused. Now I have to \"hunt\" for the video of the week, I guess? Baited into\nwatching, I have to change my bib three times because I'm slobbering all over\nmyself, over myself over myself looking at an airplane I dearly want but can't\nafford or justify anymore. Oh well \u2026 some lucky youngsters will learn to fly\nin that thang. I KNEW I shoulda bought an SR20 SRV back in the 90's (for\n$160K).\n\nWAIT! So THAT's what the \"TFT acreage\" reference was all about. Being slow, I\nhad to google that one to make sure I had it right. I was still trying to\nfigure out why Cheryl was involved.\n\nThis is better than playing Clue after a night of drinking and a long\nmotorcycle ride in the Smokies.\n\nI don't think Avweb is paying you enough, dude. Then again, Elvis got HIS\nstart on the Ed Sullivan show. And all of this at 0500. Now I'll never get\nback to sleep because I'm still all jazzed up from solving the puzzle and now\ntrying to figure out how to put a back seat PTT and USB ports in my airplane\nso I can talk to my dog.\n\nGenius!

December 19, 2019 at 4:51 am\n\nI flew the T-34A for a couple hundred hours during that same time, Mr 'Dot'.\nAt Edwards AFB, it was $8 / hr WET in the early 70's. (I paid $9 / hr for a\nC150 earlier.) That airplane suffered about a half dozen gear up landings \u2026\none of 'em exactly as you described \u2026 the Aero Club requirement was to call\n\"gear down\" in response to a tower request of \"check gear down\" and the pilot\ndid it with the gear horn sounding in the background on the tower tape on his\nfirst solo flight. That airplane is now in the Flight Test Historical Museum\ncollection at Edwards and will likely go on display soon?\n\nI once participated in recovering a second T-34A from the scene of the crash\nnear George AFB when an SR-71 pilot forgot to secure the fuel cap properly at\nnight. We picked it up out of the desert with an Army CH-47 and flew alongside\nin a UH-1\\. It was rebuilt and still flies today in private hands.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fwell-it-finally-\nhappened-zachary-i-landed-gear-up%2F)\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY [Cancel reply](/insider/well-it-finally-happened-zachary-i-\nlanded-gear-up/#respond)\n\n[Log in to leave a comment ](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Finsider%2Fwell-it-finally-\nhappened-zachary-i-landed-gear-up%2F)\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BMG-HHP-\nCRCad.jpg)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-\nconditions/coronavirus-resource-\ncenter/?utm_source=BMG&utm_medium=sidebarad&utm_campaign=CRC)\n\n#### Marketplace\n\n![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/avweb-aviation-search-\nbanner3.png)\n\n#### Featured Video\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/maxresdefault-1-324x235.jpg)![video](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/themes/Newspaper/images/icons/ico-video-\nlarge.png)](https://www.avweb.com/multimedia/best-of-the-web-f-a-18-carrier-\nrecovery/ \"Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier Recovery\")\n\n[Multimedia](https://www.avweb.com/topics/multimedia/)\n\n### [Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier\nRecovery](https://www.avweb.com/multimedia/best-of-the-web-f-a-18-carrier-\nrecovery/ \"Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier Recovery\")\n\n[Editorial Staff](https://www.avweb.com/author/estaff/) - April 5, 2020\n\nWhen Navy aircraft return to trap aboard a carrier in good weather, it's\ncalled a Case I operation.

And the gender bias that\u2019s\npermeated history has already reared its ugly head. The AI revolution has,\nuntil now, been shaped by men and is starting to marginalize half of the\nworld\u2019s most critical stakeholders: women. How can we make huge decisions that\nhave global implications if women \u2014 half of the world\u2019s population \u2014 are\nmissing from the equation? The results could be catastrophic. To address this\nchallenge of AI, we need a body of diverse leaders in Tech, led by women, to\ncome together and create industry-wide standards.\n\nAt JobsForHer\u2019s flagship event, AccelHERate 2020, senior leaders came together\nto speak at a roundtable discussion called HerTech about the challenges faced\nby women in technology.\n\n **Unconscious bias**\n\nEighty-two percent of women in the Indian tech workplace feel unheard at their\njobs. This signifies a problem with workplace culture. Technology is a male-\ndominated field and an inherent gender bias can result in lesser attention to\nthe contributions of women at the workplace. Unconscious bias, at its worst,\nreduces a professional to the value of her gender, rather than the sum of her\nexperience and skills.\n\nHow companies are solving this:\n\nPavan Kishanrao, Head, Talent Acquisition, Akamai, spoke about the need for a\nmindset change. \u201cAt Akamai, we\u2019ve impaneled inclusion coaches for every level,\nand implemented a 6-month long program with intervention to enable our women\ntech employees cross hurdles,\u201d he added.\n\n **Getting back to work**\n\nIn fields like technology, women on a career break can lose touch with\nindustry trends and end up lacking the required skillset to make a successful\nreturn to work. Moreover, when these women are interrogated about their career\nbreak at job interviews, they lose confidence in their ability to pick up\nwhere they left off. On the other hand, mothers returning to work refuse\nchallenging assignments for fear of not being able to balance work and home\nsuccessfully.\n\nHow companies are solving this:\n\nBhavna Kumar, Senior Director, Visa Technology, spoke about the efforts being\ntaken to ensure that there are sound returnee programs for women on a break.\n\nGautam Shetty, India Talent Acquisition Lead, Maersk Global Service Centres,\nechoed this sentiment when he spoke about Maersk\u2019s efforts to make the process\nof hiring itself gender-neutral. \u201cWe\u2019ve even made our job descriptions gender-\nneutral, and included videos on what a day at Maersk would involve in the\ninterest of women who apply.\u201d\n\n **Upskilling**\n\nIt is imperative for women on a career break to reskill before attempting to\nget back to work. The same is true for women professionals who are not on a\nbreak \u2014 upskilling opens up avenues and gives women the confidence to pursue\nleadership goals.\n\nHow companies are solving this:\n\nGautam Shetty expounded the benefits of Maersk\u2019s back-to-work program. \u201cWe\noffer women returnees options for reskilling through NASSCOM for training,\u201d he\nexplained.\n\n **The journey upwards**\n\nThe JobsForHer DivHERsity Survey found that while companies start with 30%\nwomen at the entry-level, the number of women dips to 10% at the managerial\nlevel and then reduces to only 1% at leadership levels.\n\nApart from several other factors mentioned above, one of the reasons for this\ndip is a hesitation to ask for leadership roles. Women also report that they\ndon\u2019t even realize that they are eligible for promotions because they\u2019re busy\nproving their worth where they are. What\u2019s more, they work under constant\ncomparison to their male peers.\n\nHow companies are solving this:\n\nGaurav Panwar, Associate Director, People Partner, S&P; Global, provided his\ninsights to the AccelHERate 2020 roundtable on the leadership challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s\nvital to send women technologists to participate in conferences like these, so\nthey get exposure to industry best practices,\u201d he said.\n\nBy advocating and implementing all the points mentioned above, JobsForHer has\nbeen trying to make the working world a welcome place for women at all stages\nof their careers, and especially in technology roles so that they are an\nactive participant in determining our future.\n\nDisclaimer: _The views expressed in the article above are those of the\nauthors' and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of this\npublishing house_\n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n[Neha Bagaria Founder & CEO JobsForHer](/tags/Neha-Bagaria-Founder-%26-CEO-\nJobsForHer-105531/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

The initiative is a\npart of Amway\u2019s broader vision of empowering its direct sellers with credible\nGovernment recognized certification as \u2018Individual sales Professional\u2019, based\non National Skill Qualification Framework (NSQF) from National Skill\nDevelopment Corporation (NSDC). Till date, Amway has trained and certified\nmore than 11,000 direct sellers as Individual Sales Professionals. Amway plans\nto train and certify 51,000 direct sellers by 2020.\n\nIn alignment with the Indian Government\u2019s \u2018Skill India\u2019 initiative, Amway has\nbeen significantly contributing towards skill development and nurturing\nentrepreneurship in the country by focusing its training strategy on enhancing\nskills and competencies of its direct sellers. The company conducts more than\n18,000 training sessions annually. Additionally, Amway has also developed a\ncomprehensive digital learning portal to enhance the skills and knowledge of\nits direct sellers.\n\nChandra Bhushan Chakraborty, Vice President\u2013East, Amway India, said, \u201cMicro\nentrepreneurship and self-employment through skill development are key\npriority areas for the Government of India. In line with this, we have aligned\nour training strategy to provide appropriate tools and training to our direct\nsellers to enhance their competencies and skills. Our association with RASCI\nis one such initiative to get our direct sellers certified by a Government\nrecognized body and I am very happy today that this initiative has been\nrecognized at a prestigious platform like this.\u201d\n\nAccording to the World Bank Report, it is estimated that more than eight\nmillion jobs are required every year in India as the working-age population\ncontinues to increase by 1.3 million every month. On the contrary, only 7\nmillion jobs are being created annually in the country. There is a huge\nemployment gap that needs attention. To address this, the Government of India\nis driving entrepreneurship and self-employment through its skilling\ninitiative. Amway India too has aligned its strategy with the Government\u2019s\nagenda and has encouraged more than 5.5 lakh individuals to take up\nentrepreneurship as a way of living. With zero capital investment and no\nburden of manufacturing, a direct seller can build his own business with\nAmway.\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n[amway india](/tags/amway-india-13480/) [skill development](/tags/skill-\ndevelopment-6461/) [assocham](/tags/assocham-2873/) [jobs](/tags/jobs-1747/)\n[government of india](/tags/government-of-india-12747/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

These are\nsome of the languages taught:\n\n  * HTML5\n  * jQuery\n  * JavaScript\n  * CSS3\n  * MySQL\n\n  \nSign up at [thecodeplayer.com](http://www.thecodeplayer.com).\n\n## The Odin Project\n\nThis site lets you learn coding online for free. Plus, you can take part in\nsmall projects to help create your body of work. Moreover, you get to work\nwith other learners on varying projects, which improves understanding through\ncollaboration. At The Odin Project, you can learn many of the basic\nprogramming languages, such as these:\n\n  * jQuery\n  * Ruby on Rails\n  * HTML5\n  * CSS3\n  * JavaScript\n\n  \nSign up at [www.theodinproject.com](http://www.theodinproject.com).\n\n## HTML Dog\n\nThis site houses all sorts of help for learning to use HTML, CSS and\nJavaScript. It includes examples, tutorials, tips and tricks for advanced\ntechniques, all for free. These are three of the most common web programming\nlanguages around and are a great place to start.\n\nSign up at [htmldog.com](http://www.htmldog.com/).\n\n## Additional Options\n\nBrowse the offerings that interest you most, but carve out time to test-drive\nat least one free course. The only investment is your time, and you'll know\npretty quickly if the topic interests you enough to stick with it.  \n  \nAlthough mastering technique is critical to a developer, you also need to know\nhow to analyze complex problems and break them down into parts or steps,\nbefore applying coding. (Knowing how to do this can also make your code more\nefficient.) [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) presents \"challenging\nmathematical/computer programming problems\" that help you learn how to tackle\ntechnical problems.  \n  \nFor free hands-on practice, [Reddit\u2019s DailyProgrammer\n](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/)posts weekly programming\nchallenges. Participants can post code for peer review, and Reddit encourages\nthem to review other participants' code with professionalism and positivity.  \n  \nBe sure to check out [Git Hub](https://github.com/github), too. This site is a\nterrific resource for coding DIYers, and, once you pass the learning phase and\nbegin coding some useful stuff, your personal GitHub page can act as a\nportfolio of your work.  \n  \nRegardless of your learning style, building great coding skills takes effort,\nlong hours and practice. A course is simply a first step, or supplement, to\nyour commitment to a bright and productive future.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\n  * [ ![Free Microsoft Azure Online Training Resources You

electric airplanes haven\u2019t gained traction in the U.S., Slovenia-\nbased Pipistrel is doing a brisk business selling them to the rest of the\nworld. It has recently increased production from four to about six airplanes\nper month and the company\u2019s factory in Italy will soon double its\nmanufacturing space, with most of that given over to electric aircraft.\n\nWhen AVweb visited the new Gorizia, Italy, plant last May, the company had\nroom to expand, but has since filled that up and then some, according to\nPipistrel\u2019s Michael Coates, who directs marketing for the U.S., Australia and\nNew Zealand.\n\nWho\u2019s buying? \u201cThe person who is buying is normally a flying school operation\nor an Elon Musk-type high net worth individual taken by wanting to save the\nplanet and wanting an electric aircraft,\u201d Coates told us in an interview last\nweek. \u201cThere are a few people out there who want something to fly so they feel\nthey\u2019re not damaging the environment,\u201d he adds.\n\nConcerns about noise remain a big driver, Coates says. \u201cIn Europe, it\u2019s the\nnoise. Electric airplanes are a lot quieter. In countries like Switzerland,\nthey have extremely strict noise regulation and that\u2019s driving the change to\nelectric,\u201d he says.\n\nCurrently, Pipistrel sells the Alpha Electro, which is essentially an\nelectrified version of its Rotax-powered Alpha trainer. Pipistrel has long\nrecognized that electric airplanes are hobbled by their short endurance and\nhas encouraged buyers to purchase both the gasoline and electric versions. The\nAlpha Electro is suitable for pattern and practice area work while the\ngasoline model can be used for cross-country training.\n\nThe next version of the Electro will be certified under EASA CS LSA and will\ninclude water-cooled batteries. Coates says this may provide two improvements:\nfaster charging time and longer battery life due to better thermal stability.\n\n\u201cThe problem with rapid charging is to control the temperatures. With an air-\ncooled system, you can reduce the temperatures by about 10 degrees Celsius.\nWith water cooling, you can drop it down by 20 degrees,\u201d Coates says. Although\nPipistrel hasn\u2019t confirmed this by field experience yet, water cooling could\nreduce charging times well below the one minute of charge for one minute of\nflight that\u2019s now the rule of thumb. The cooling system has a Rotax-type oil\ncooler radiator with a small electric pump to circulate standard engine\ncoolant.\n\n#### Other AVwebflash Articles\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/Pipistrel-100x70.jpg)](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-\nnews/pipistrel-ramps-up-electric-aircraft-production/ \"Pipistrel Ramps Up\nElectric Aircraft Production\")\n\n### [Pipistrel Ramps Up Electric Aircraft\nProduction](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/pipistrel-ramps-up-electric-\naircraft-production/ \"Pipistrel Ramps Up Electric Aircraft Production\")\n\n[Aviation News](https://www.avweb.com/topics/aviation-news/) January 21, 2020\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/Boeing-777X-100x70.jpg)](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-\nnews/boeing-could-fly-777x-this-week/ \"Boeing Could Fly 777X This Week\")\n\n### [Boeing Could Fly 777X This Week](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-\nnews/boeing-could-fly-777x-this-week/ \"Boeing Could Fly 777X This Week\")\n\n[Aviation News](https://www.avweb.com/topics/aviation-news/) January 21, 2020\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/KC-46-1-100x70.jpeg)](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-\nnews/boeings-new-ceo-under-pressure-from-usaf/ \"Boeing\u2019s New CEO Under\nPressure From USAF\")\n\n### [Boeing\u2019s New CEO Under Pressure From\nUSAF](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/boeings-new-ceo-under-pressure-from-\nusaf/ \"Boeing\u2019s New CEO Under Pressure From USAF\")\n\n[Aviation News](https://www.avweb.com/topics/aviation-news/) January 21, 2020\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/wag2015_balloons_dubai-100x70.jpg)](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-\nnews/fai-world-air-games-canceled/ \"FAI World Air Games Canceled\")\n\n### [FAI World Air Games Canceled](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-news/fai-\nworld-air-games-canceled/ \"FAI World Air Games Canceled\")\n\n[Air Shows & Events](https://www.avweb.com/topics/air-shows-events/) January\n21, 2020\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/PS-Engineering-\nPAC45D-100x70.jpg)](https://www.avweb.com/avionics/ps-engineering-introduces-\npac45d/ \"PS Engineering Introduces PAC45D\")\n\n### [PS Engineering Introduces PAC45D](https://www.avweb.com/avionics/ps-\nengineering-introduces-pac45d/ \"PS Engineering Introduces PAC45D\")\n\n[Avionics](https://www.avweb.com/topics/avionics/) January 21, 2020\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bell-Boeing-\nCMV-22B-Osprey-First-Flight-100x70.jpg)](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-\nnews/military-aviation/osprey-variant-completes-first-flight/ \"Osprey Variant\nCompletes First Flight\")\n\n### [Osprey Variant Completes First Flight](https://www.avweb.com/aviation-\nnews/military-aviation/osprey-variant-completes-first-flight/ \"Osprey Variant\nCompletes First Flight\")\n\n[Military Aviation](https://www.avweb.com/topics/aviation-news/military-\naviation/) January 21, 2020\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/fuel-\ndump-74-100x70.jpg)](https://www.avweb.com/insider/its-raining-kerosene-or-\nwhy-1950s-kids-had-so-much-more-fun/ \"It\u2019s Raining Kerosene?

He said he did not\ncare about range because basically he just drove around locally to shops near\nhis home. He did not care that it would actually cost him 4-5 times as much\nper per mile as a gas car \"because he would not drive far\".

My\nTesla has a 300 mile range, and the country wide charging network Tesla\nprovides allows me to drive from Florida to Oregon with no problem at all. I\ncharge at home every night, so I have a full \u201ctank\u201d every day, and as a bonus\nmy car allows free charging on the Tesla Superchargers, so my trip to Oregon\ncosts me nothing in fuel.\n\nBeyond that , I can blow any car less costing less than 300K off the road\n0-60, it\u2019s quiet and smooth, and the best tech I\u2019ve ever seen. Best car I\u2019ve\nowned in 45 years of car ownership.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love me a big old oil dripping radial engine on\naircraft, but believe me, electric cars are so much better than ICE cars, my\nRam truck feels so 19th century now. They are far simpler in amount of parts,\nvery little maintenance needed. I have no doubt they are the future.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fpipistrel-\nramps-up-electric-aircraft-production%2F)\n\n      * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1e414fdf48f19ca36e3aa63cea28252b?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Lindamon G.

You can\nfind very good Teslas in the 30k range. You shouldn't pay more than 1k for the\nhome charger and you can use the plug for other things (power tools,\nwasher/dryer, ect.) If you want a luxury car you'd be hard pressed to find a\nmore economical one.\n\n          * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/043e1c6860f014321eeace458fc9df9d?s=50&d=mm&r=g) William B. January 22, 2020 at 6:12 pm\n\nMark,\n\nA Tesla does have the range and infrastructure to make long distance cross\ncountry road trips. Your grocery (errand) and commuting vehicles are priced\nwell under $50K today, new. And that's prior to any local or federal tax\nincentives or rebates.\n\nThe new BMW MINI Cooper EV is priced very aggressively to sell, they are\nasking $30K for a base model prior to the full $7.5K tax credit, effectively\noffering a stylist, fun, errand running commuter for just over $20K. Sure, 110\nmiles isn't very much, but for errands and commuting that's more than enough\nfor most of us, statistically. Our 2017 Volt, a vehicle that is currently\npriced under $25K used, only offered a 53 mile EPA range, but 53 miles was\nmore then enough to cover the 32 mile commute plus errands. Even during the\nharsh MN winters, where range was cut by 25-35 %, we were satisfied with 50\nmiles.\n\nSpeaking of the used market, grocery getting, errand running EVs can be found\nfor $7 -25K (all electric as opposed to the gas range extending Volt).\n\nCost of operating is far lower over an equivalent gasoline vehicle. I'm not\nfamiliar with any current U.S. residential electricity rates that will surpass\nthe local price of gasoline in similar operating costs. We are saving about\n$700-800 annually in the state not WA prior to any maintenance shavings. Lack\nof oil changes, air filters and near lifetime brakes are a few perks that come\nwith EV ownership.\n\nResidential EV infrastructure isn't expensive. If one prefers to get by with\njust the 110V outlet (otherwise known as level 1 charging), it'll offer about\n50 miles overnight for an average sized EV (Model 3, Volt, Bolt etc), no extra\ncost to the consumer. We moved into a house with an installed dryer outlet in\nthe garage (240V), instead of hiring an electrician we simply plugged in our\n$400 ClipperCreek 15 amp EVSE (Level 2 charging) into the 240V circuit and\nbought a heat pump clothes dryer requiring only 110V. But based on our setup,\nan electrician would most likely charge $500 for an added 240V circuit\nconsidering the close proximity of the box.\n\n      * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/470f3c99cd8a5b26908caaeeaf6c9b7a?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Mark F.

January 22, 2020 at 1:21 pm\n\nLindamon, I'm curious about the actual range of your Tesla. Elon Musk says\nthey will go 300 miles between charges, but I wonder what the real world range\nis for the average driver. How does it do on freezing days up north, or what\ndrop in range do you suffer when it's 90+ degrees outside and you need the AC\nrunning full blast to cool the car? I agree that Tesla makes a great product\nwith some true cutting edge motor technology, but all car makers fudge on the\nhigh side with real world performance.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fpipistrel-\nramps-up-electric-aircraft-production%2F)\n\n        * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/21fa6f658239487f63084689353b5a32?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Jeffrey M.

We live in Florida, so can't\ncomment on brutal winter weather, but it handles 30's and 40's no problem with\na real world range around 225 miles.\n\nAlso, can confirm, this thing is a rocket ship.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fpipistrel-\nramps-up-electric-aircraft-production%2F)\n\n    * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c8f86b805d6dba3bb137284bdd7092cb?s=50&d=mm&r=g) John M.

They are substantially cheaper unless\nyou intentionally make an unfair comparison of say a used honda civic to a\nbrand new model S (that more closely competes with a new Mercedes).\n\nI get about 300 miles in my model 3 in the summer, closer to 200 on a very\ncold winter day. My model 3 performance model cost significantly less than the\nBMW M3 or Audi RS that I would have otherwise bought (and faster, also). Since\nthen my version of the model 3 has dropped in price.\n\nThe only group of people that electric cars really don't work for are those\nthat are fearful of change, which is very human and understandable.\nUnfortunately you have to be increasingly distanced from the facts to justify\nnot buying one as time goes on.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fpipistrel-\nramps-up-electric-aircraft-production%2F)\n\n      * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/470f3c99cd8a5b26908caaeeaf6c9b7a?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Mark F.

Thanks for agreeing that it was not economical to do that.\n\nThe same goes for training aircraft. It's not economical for flight schools to\nbuy an expensive new electric plane and plan to only fly around the pattern.\nYou get a $25K C150 so you can MAKE money just futzing around the pattern with\nstudents.

Cheap to\noperate, almost no noise from the ground and very neighbor friendly.\n\nThe school would also own 1 gas powered aircraft which is 99% the same to fly\nand operate for all cross country training.\n\nThe ideal ratio is 4:1 for a busy school with 5 aircraft operating (4 electric\nand one gas)\n\nPlease remember like the first flight in aviation just over 100 years ago, its\nnew technology which has some great advantages but also some limitations. The\nlimitations at this time is flight duration but on the other hand, its the\ncheapest way to fly and also respect the environment at the same time.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fpipistrel-\nramps-up-electric-aircraft-production%2F)\n\n      * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/470f3c99cd8a5b26908caaeeaf6c9b7a?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Mark F.

Seems like that would\ntake all of 15 minutes.

It's a good thing that all these armchair quarterbacks commenting on\nthese posts don't call the shots when it comes to R&D.\n\nBattery technology is advancing and within the next couple of years there will\nbe a couple of quantum leaps in energy density as well as charging options as\nbreakthroughs are being made with Li-CO2 and Li-S batteries. Li-CO2 promises\nup to 7x the energy of Li-Ion batteries, so just image having one of these\nPipistrels today and in 5 years seeing your range increase more than five-\nfold!\n\nAt least Alex R. is one of the few commenters here who shows some vision.\n\nElectric cars are coming of age after a couple of decades of R&D. And as\nprices come down in the next few years they will start taking more and more\nmarket share away from gas guzzlers. Because who wouldn't want a car that not\nonly runs on clean electricity (yes, I know, we still burn FFs to create\nelectricity, but the economy of scale means far less emissions), but is\nquieter, outperforms ICE cars, and has much lower maintenance costs thanks\nfewer moving parts. I own a Prius now and have decided that it's the last fuel\nburning car I will ever own. Next car will be pure electric and the surplus\npower that the solar panels on my roof generate will be going into that car\ninstead of going back to the power company for which they only pay me $0.035\nper kWHr.\n\nSo now that electric cars are on the cusp of becoming mainstream, aviation is\nnext and this article is a sign that it WILL HAPPEN.\n\nThis is disruptive technology and we are at the bottom of the S curve just\ncoming around the bend. This is a couple of years away from really taking off\nand all the negative-nancies hear will have to re-think their positions,\nbecause when it comes to technological advances you are either disrupting or\nbeing disrupted. Resist change all you want, but it's still going to happen.\nAnd in this case, this is a good thing.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fpipistrel-\nramps-up-electric-aircraft-production%2F)\n\n      * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0572574362ca77bbbd4beabda405be55?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Cameron G.

I can see Li-S batteries being at 1300 Whr/kg within 10 years. That's\na better than 5x improvement. That would mean the current long range Teslas\nwould have a range of over 1500 miles! and this Pipestrel would have an\nendurance of over 5 hours! So yes, 7X is more than enough.\n\nJust compare it to a Cessna 152 which is also commonely used for training. The\nPipestrel Alpha Electra has comparable cruise performance and a better payload\nthan a fully fueled C152. The only area the 152 beats the Pipestrel right now\nis in endurance. In ten years that may no longer be true. And using an\nelectric rate of 17 cents per kWHr (which is my rate here in NY but rates are\nmuch lower across the country) the energy cost to operate the Pipestrel is\nabout $3.85 per hour compared to a C152 which is about $30 per hour.\n\nI can see flight schools gobbling up these planes once higher density\nbatteries are available, and most schools wouldn't even need to wait for 5X or\n7X to justify the investment. 3X would more than do it.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fpipistrel-\nramps-up-electric-aircraft-production%2F)\n\n  7. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/662c5d5bcf95b865ffc088d42964cb8b?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Raf S.

What they\nconveniently ignore is that, at least to this point, the various governments\nhave not devised an effective way to tax their \"fuel\". In the U.S., fuel taxes\namount to about a third of the cost of a gallon of gasoline. That tax is\nintended to pay for construction and maintenance of the highway system, or to\nsupport the Airways Trust Fund. When equivalent taxes are levied on those\nelectric vehicles, their operating expenses will go up considerably. And, even\nif you charge at home, most cars require an expensive charging system that\nshould be added into the cost per mile of the car in addition to the price per\nKWH you pay for the recharge.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, if you want an electric vehicle - car or plane -\nknock yourself out.

This is a hot topic\nthat will need to be addressed. A solution would be to charge EVERY vehicle a\nflat fee based on weight, effectively eliminating the gas tax, or to offer a\nflat fee if the owner/operator opts out to be \"tracked\" for actual miles\ndriven. I believe OR is doing something similar.\n\nEVs don't need any charging infrastructure installed if the owner/operator can\nget by with Level 1 charging on 110V using a typical household outlet. Level 1\noffers about 50 miles overnight for midsized EV (Model 3, Volt, Bolt etc).\nLevel 2 (240V) total costs could range from $1,000 - $2,000 which includes the\nLevel 2 EVSE and the installation of a dedicated circuit. If there is a\nwelding or dryer outlet already installed then the costs of a Level 2 EVSE\nwill range from $400-$600. In many cases $400-600 is paid back in a year with\noperating cost savings.

The 'aren't we great' argument is\noverblown/hypocritical when we consider our consumption of\nelectronics/plastics that have such little actual life-use.\n\nHowever, a flight school toggling EV trainers with our venerable gas-gulping\nones, now that is interesting and quite agreeable to me. So many NIMBY\nregulations confining and raising the cost of entry into GA > Career at flight\nschools now this could actually help. I would gladly accept the challenge to\naugment my quiver of currency with an EV. And in this scenario with aviation,\nI think these would help our climate concerns mandate.\n\nCheers\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fpipistrel-\nramps-up-electric-aircraft-production%2F)\n\n    * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6322bd68bece4e6e332dbc73f8888b99?s=50&d=mm&r=g) YARS .

Just imagine the benefits:\n\n1) No more oil changes.  \n2) No more spark plug maintenance.  \n3) No more magneto rebuilds.  \n4) No more expensive exhaust maintenance.  \n5) No more periodic expensive oil hose replacement.  \n6) No more worries about cracked cabin heat shrouds (those this are\nridiculously expensive).  \n7) No more expensive smelly dirty avgas.  \n8) Quiet operation.  \n9) Lower cabin vibration.  \n10) Full power at any altitude.  \n11) No wasting energy when waiting 25 minutes to take off from busy airports.\n\nThe list can go on and on, but you see my point. All of these benefits justify\nall the investment by the many players in the electric aviation industry.\n\nLooking forward I have been following a lot of developments into battery\ntechnology. R&D in Li-S and Li-CO2 batteries are very promising with potential\nenergy densities of at least 7X that of current Li-Ion batteries. What that\nmeans is that the Pipestrel that has a one hour range today can potentially\nhave a 7 hour range when they retrofit newer batteries in the future. If you\naren't even the least bit excited about this and what this could mean for the\nfuture of aviation then I don't know what to say, other than I'm glad that\ntype of thinking didn't prevail when Ford introduced the horseless carriage.\n\nI dream about a day when I taxi my electric airplane back to my tiedown spot,\npull the removable battery modules out of the wings, and take them home to be\ncharged using the solar panels on my roof. I would actually be flying with\nzero incremental carbon footprint! and it would cost me nothing!\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fpipistrel-\nramps-up-electric-aircraft-production%2F)\n\n      * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/470f3c99cd8a5b26908caaeeaf6c9b7a?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Mark F.

But most of the \"doubters\" who reside here have seen too many \"wave\nof the future\" ideas die a horrible death when it comes to making them\nmainstream in aviation. Do flying cars, cheap LSAs, etc., ring a bell? Don't\nconfuse an increase in energy density in a battery with an equivalent range\nextension. Also, don't assume that the newer batteries - designed to propel\nground vehicles - would be the same for use in an aircraft. The Pipistrel\nbattery packs bear little resemblance to those in a Tesla. The other problem\nis that those pesky regulatory agencies will drive the cost of certification\nfor such innovations higher than the service ceiling of the aircraft. Their\nattitude about green vehicles is probably about the same as some of the\nfossils here in this blog. Getting a new electric car built and certified as\nroadworthy is a slam dunk compared with getting much of anything approved by\nthe FAA. I wish it weren't true, but sadly it is.\n\nPersonally, I think that electric propulsion would be great, for all the\nreasons presented above. I love my Cardinal, and would be overjoyed if it\ncould be retrofitted with an electric motor, but realistically, not in my\nlifetime. You must be a young man if you think your dream may come true in\nyour flying future. Practical implementation of long-range, rapid recharge,\npure electric airplanes are probably a decade away at best. I'm talking about\nfour-place replacements for 172s or Cardinals, not two-place pattern trainers.\nI hope to be here to see that, but I doubt that I will be still able to fly\nit, unless it is one of Yars' \"autonomous\" commuter drones. \ud83d\ude09\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fpipistrel-\nramps-up-electric-aircraft-production%2F)\n\n        * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/da6d568f27e421aab63a557440dcd9bb?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Daniel T.

Will the overwhelming majority of U.S.\nflight schools support the Pipistrel Alpha Electro?\"\n\nPipistrel does not need the \"overwhelming majority of US flight schools\nsupport\". They are selling electric trainers elsewhere that are already\nreceiving it well, including the business model mix of gas and electric. The\nEuropean flight schools are paying significantly more for avgas/mogas than we\nare and have to deal with EU noise limitations to even fly. EASA certs include\njumping through the noise hoops which the Electric Alpha and Rotax powered\nversion meet. Having an airplane that already meets those requirements in\nEurope via EASA certification makes FAA certification much easier especially\nin the light of the current FAA, knee jerk to MCAS re-certification mess.\nRight now, the FAA is at a snail pace for final approval on aviation\nimprovements validated well in advance of MCAS. Sure Pipistrel wants market\nshare in the US. But that is some distance off until the FAA approval process\nimproves and speeds up. While all that is going on, Pipistrel will have made\nconsiderable progress in their products.\n\nThe US flight schools stand to gain a lot from these inevitable improvements\nwhen the FAA starts to promulgate the rules for electric flight including\nflight training. We are debating business models and the pros and cons of\nelectric flight when there is no official class or sanction at this point the\nFAA can agree on for the basis of certification. It took decades to finally\nget FAA approval to use an Experimental airplane to train/transition pilots in\nthe same airplane type when completed and get expenses covered.\n\nThink about Van Nuys, Santa Monica, Palwaukee (Chicago Executive) north of\nO'Hare. Schaumburg Airport just 9nm west of O'Hare's longest E/W runway has a\n1200ft pattern ceiling with 3000ft ceiling limitations in the practice area\nwhich is saturated with housing just like Van Nuys. All of these airports have\nflight schools, lots of them. The electric Pipistrel model would be a welcome\nblessing today if that was FAA possible.\n\n\"Rapid improvement is good; it also means that your $150,000 iPlane becomes\nrapidly obsolete.\" Where in aviation is there a planned obsolescence built in\nlike a common consumer product? You can still restore a Windekker Eagle using\napproved parts including the plastics and resins which are still available by\nDuPont. Want to restore, maintain,and fly a Curtiss Jenny? Have at it.\nPipistrel is well aware of the FAA and EASA certification process. Pipistrel\ndoes not want to bring out new technology that cannot be easily retrofitted in\ncurrent models.\n\nBecause the certification process is so difficult and expensive, because of\ncertification of mods via STC on existing airplanes is such a pain in the\n______, I cannot think of a single airplane manufacturer past or present who\nintentionally made it impossible to add improved technology. Want ADS-B In and\nOUT with the latest glass panel in your restored Jenny? Want to remove the\nOX-5 and install a Siemens electric motor? Go for it. All it takes is gobs of\nmoney and patience. If there is anything a current aircraft manufacturer does\nNOT want to do, is certify an airplane that cannot be retrofitted with\nimprovements they have engineered in their new models.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fpipistrel-\nramps-up-electric-aircraft-production%2F)\n\n    * ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/662c5d5bcf95b865ffc088d42964cb8b?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Raf S.

Unit prices for the F-35B and F-35C variants dropped an average of\n12.3 percent and 13.2 percent respectively.\n\n\"With smart acquisition strategies, strong government-industry partnership and\na relentless focus on quality and cost reduction, the F-35 Enterprise has\nsuccessfully reduced procurement costs of the 5th Generation F-35 to equal or\nless than 4th Generation legacy aircraft,\" said Lockheed Martin F-35 Program\nVice President and General Manager Greg Ulmer. \"With the F-35A unit cost now\nbelow $80 million in Lot 13, we were able to exceed our long-standing cost\nreduction commitment one year earlier than planned.\"\n\nBy Lot 14, the F-35A is expected to cost $77.9 million per unit with the F-35B\nat $101.3 million and the F-35C at $94.4 million each. According to Lockheed\nMartin, the F-35 fleet currently includes more than 450 aircraft stationed at\n19 bases around the world. The fleet has accrued in excess of 220,000 flight\nhours.\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [Lockheed Martin](https://www.avweb.com/tag/lockheed-martin/)\n\n#### Other AVwebflash

Especially\nconsidering it is already the single most expensive military contract in\nhistory. How many drones, F-22 Raptors or even aircraft carriers could they\nhave built with 35 billion? Pity the poor schmuk pilot that loses one in\ntraining or mock combat exercises.\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fmilitary-\naviation%2Flockheed-martin-finalizes-34-billion-contract-for-cheaper-f-35s%2F)\n\n  2. ![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e086b74236f42d539f75a6b49cd3bbf4?s=50&d=mm&r=g) Carl R.

The program had initial\nacquisition cost of $406.5 billion. Divide that by the into the 430 aircraft\nthat have been built and the 478 covered in the contract.  \nThere is no way these costs are anywhere near the costs of 4th gen acquisition\ncosts.  \nAlso, forgot to mention that CBO experts estimate the hourly cost of $44k and\nno realistic way to ever get to Lockheed's goal of a \"cheap\" hourly rate of\n$25,000/hr\n\n[Log in to leave a comment](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fmilitary-\naviation%2Flockheed-martin-finalizes-34-billion-contract-for-cheaper-f-35s%2F)\n\n### LEAVE A REPLY [Cancel reply](/aviation-news/military-aviation/lockheed-\nmartin-finalizes-34-billion-contract-for-cheaper-f-35s/#respond)\n\n[Log in to leave a comment ](https://www.avweb.com/wp-\nlogin.php?redirect_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avweb.com%2Faviation-news%2Fmilitary-\naviation%2Flockheed-martin-finalizes-34-billion-contract-for-cheaper-f-35s%2F)\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BMG-HHP-\nCRCad.jpg)](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-\nconditions/coronavirus-resource-\ncenter/?utm_source=BMG&utm_medium=sidebarad&utm_campaign=CRC)\n\n#### Marketplace\n\n![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/avweb-aviation-search-\nbanner3.png)\n\n#### Featured Video\n\n[![](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/maxresdefault-1-324x235.jpg)![video](https://s30121.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/themes/Newspaper/images/icons/ico-video-\nlarge.png)](https://www.avweb.com/multimedia/best-of-the-web-f-a-18-carrier-\nrecovery/ \"Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier Recovery\")\n\n[Multimedia](https://www.avweb.com/topics/multimedia/)\n\n### [Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier\nRecovery](https://www.avweb.com/multimedia/best-of-the-web-f-a-18-carrier-\nrecovery/ \"Best of the Web: F/A-18 Carrier Recovery\")\n\n[Editorial Staff](https://www.avweb.com/author/estaff/) - April 5, 2020\n\nWhen Navy aircraft return to trap aboard a carrier in good weather, it's\ncalled a Case I operation.

The report highlights North American IT professionals earn\n$109,985, which is 23 percent more than the worldwide average, which increases\nto 27 percent in the US.\n\nA clear distinction across all geographies is the ratio of IT decision-makers\u2019\nsalaries compared to the salaries of the employees they manage. In North\nAmerica, IT managers earn an average of 40 percent more than their staff. This\nratio is comparable to Latin America (44 percent) and Asia-Pacific (38\npercent).\n\n **Salaries are going up**\n\nGlobal IT compensation is the highest it\u2019s ever been. There are a number of\nfactors at play, including responsibility level, job function, tenure, company\nsize, industry and where you live. This report examines how the top-paying IT\nprofessionals fit into all of these categories.\n\n **Want a raise? Be better at your job**\n\nIT professionals on average earned $5,000 more this year compared to 2018. The\nmain reason? Job performance. Training to add skills that immediately\ntranslate to the workplace is leading to pay increases. Professional\ndevelopment makes a difference if you\u2019re looking to boost your earnings.\n\n **Certifications matter**\n\nEighty-five percent of global IT professionals hold at least one\ncertification, of which over half were earned in the past 12 months. Another\n66 percent plan to attain a new certification this year. Tech professionals\nstill see the value in certifications and are pursuing them in various\ncategories and technologies.\n\n **Top-paying certifications vary by region**\n\nInstead of just looking at the highest-paying certifications worldwide, this\nyear we broke up our lists by region. That means the top-paying certification\nin North America may not match the top-paying credential in Latin America.\n\nThe highest salary increase was amongst Latin American IT professionals, who\nexperienced an average raise of 6.5 percent. North America (5.8 percent), EMEA\n(5.6 percent) and Asia-Pacific (5.2 percent) saw slightly smaller increases.\n\nForty-two percent of the respondents who received a raise attribute it\nprimarily to job performance. Standard company increase is the second most\nfrequently mentioned reason. Fifteen percent were promoted within their\ncompany in the past year.\n\nThe reason for a raise impacts the amount of the raise. Nine percent of IT\nprofessionals attribute their raise to adding new skills\u2014those same\nindividuals earned nearly $12,000 more than last year, a strong indication\nthat training pays off.\n\nProfessionals who left their current company and sought a promotion elsewhere\nsaw their salaries jump over 26 percent, while those who were promoted\ninternally increased their salaries by 14 percent. A lateral move to another\ncompany resulted in a 20 percent salary increase.\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n[salary](/tags/salary-648/) [IT Professionals](/tags/IT-Professionals-66377/)\n[jobs](/tags/jobs-1747/) [job](/tags/job-19023/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!
