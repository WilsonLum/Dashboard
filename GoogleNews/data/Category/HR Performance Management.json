to\ncomplete their 2019-20 performance management cycle, Penn State Human\nResources is extending the time needed to complete the final step of the\nprocess (end-of-year review) to **Friday, May 1, through Friday, July 31.**\n\nPreviously, this step was to begin on Wednesday, April 1, with completion by\nSunday, May 31. However, due to the current coronavirus pandemic, Human\nResources, in agreement with University leadership, believed it was in the\nbest interest of our employees to extend the time frame.\n\nEmployees who had not completed step one or step two of the 2019-20\nperformance management cycle received previous communication to complete those\nsteps by Friday, March 27. At this time, that deadline has been **extended to\nThursday, April 30.**\n\nTo help employees prepare for end-of-year reviews, the following Zoom training\nsessions are open for registration:\n\n  * [How to Prepare for Your End-of-Year Review - Staff](https://psu.csod.com/LMS/LoDetails/DetailsLo.aspx?loid=44df4f92-64cc-465d-ab0c-d83f7ef3f27d#t=3 \"Original URL: https://psu.csod.com/samldefault.aspx?returnurl=%252fDeepLink%252fProcessRedirect.aspx%253fmodule%253dlodetails%2526lo%253d44df4f92-64cc-465d-ab0c-d83f7ef3f27d.

Yet,\nthese days, even he finds himself a bit flummoxed by the unprecedented changes\nprompted by the coronavirus pandemic that have suddenly swept millions of U.S.\noffice workers into[ telework\narrangements](https://hrexecutive.com/coronavirus-driving-work-from-home-\nmandates/).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in brand-new, uncharted territory,\u201d he says.\n\n**See also:[Coronavirus-HR's role](https://hrexecutive.com/coronavirus-hrs-\nrole/)**\n\nManagers who must now contend with managing the performance of large numbers\nof remote employees for an extended period would undoubtedly agree.\n\nAs a starting point, Lewis suggests they begin by doing something that\u2019s\nnormally ill-advised: micro-manage.\n\n\u201cMost employees aren\u2019t used to working remotely,\u201d he says. \u201cPlus, they\u2019re\nworking in less-than-ideal conditions.\u201d\n\nIn many cases, employees will also have their children and spouse home with\nthem. Employees with roommates who are also stuck at home must find ways of\nremaining focused and productive. Teleworkers in most locations no longer have\nthe option of working from their favorite coffee shop or the library as a\nplace of respite.\n\nAll of this means that managers must play a guiding role in helping employees\nget acclimated to their new circumstances as best they can, says Lewis.\n\n\u201cThese workers may be dealing with technology-related issues, getting used to\nusing Zoom and other tools, and at the same time their young children may be\npestering them for a snack or help with their schoolwork,\u201d he says.\n\nDon\u2019t assume that even your team members who normally work well independently\nwill rapidly adapt to telework, cautions Lewis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big adjustment for everyone,\u201d he says.\n\nManagers should start by helping each of their employees create an at-home\nwork structure. They should also schedule regular check-ins by phone each day\nfor each of their direct reports to get a sense of how they\u2019re coping. In some\ncases, those check-ins should be twice a day\u2014once in the morning and then late\nafternoon\u2014to assess how they\u2019re doing and help resolve potential issues.\n\n\u201cFrame it as \u2018I\u2019m not trying to monitor you, I\u2019m here to help you establish\nstructure because right now, structure\u2019s been obliterated.\u2019 \u201d\n\nManagers may also need to reset their expectations for productivity, says\nLewis. \u201cIn terms of widgets, whereas before, they were to produce X number\nwithin eight hours, perhaps now it could be 12 hours.\u201d\n\nWorking from home means that work may occur more sporadically throughout the\nday, in some cases after the kids have gone to bed, he says.\n\nStriking the right tone is critical.\n\n\u201cIf you tell your employees this is less about getting this amount of stuff\ndone between nine and five and instead by having it done by this date, then\nthat\u2019s huge,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cIt will go a long way toward keeping everyone sane\nand on track.\u201d\n\nAndrew R.

Underperforming or dysfunctional employees can wreak havoc on company\nculture if unaddressed, and overperforming employees can burn out or disengage\nwithout reassurance or sustainable workloads.\n\nPerformance management strategies equip companies to support employee\ndevelopment so all employees can function at their best while continuing\npersonal and professional development throughout their careers. By empowering\nleadership at every level to cultivate excellence with their employees and\ntheir teams, performance management empowers everyone in the company to\nthrive. Here's how.\n\n**Everyone Needs Feedback**\n\nEvery employee at every level should participate in performance management.\nEven top leadership should receive regular reviews from their supervisors\n(and/or the board). Annual reviews accompanied by goal-setting and\nmonthly/quarterly check-ins embed accountability and growth into company\nculture and normalize self-reflection, collective awareness and collaboration.\n\nSome companies allow employees to evaluate their supervisors, creating a\nmultidirectional feedback loop for employee growth and development. Such\nopenness to feedback from above and below reiterates the value of every\nemployee\u2019s voice and insights in shaping company culture. Employees feel heard\nand valued, and decision-makers remain informed about how policies impact on-\nthe-ground operations and employee engagement.\n\n**Earlier Is Better**\n\nWhile quarterly, six-month and annual review cycles may suffice for current\nemployees, new employees need feedback early and often as they learn your\ncompany and their roles within it. Onboarding should facilitate bidirectional\nfeedback on employee performance and needs so employees feel prepared for\ntheir new responsibilities. Has their training prepared them to function\nindependently, or do they need additional instruction? Do employees know who\nto contact with questions? Are trainers satisfied with the employee\u2019s\nprogress, or are there concerns? If there are concerns, is the employee aware\nof areas needing improvement and how to address them appropriately?\n\nRegardless of employee tenure, when performance issues arrive, early\nintervention is key. The longer employees \u201cget away with\u201d poor performance,\nthe harder correction becomes. Sometimes performance slips indicate personal\nor professional problems which can be resolved, restoring the employee to\ntheir former success, or better. Sometimes performance issues point to larger\nsystemic problems like poor leadership, inadequate resources, unsustainable\nwork environments, or flawed policies and procedures.\n\nEnabling poor performance or dysfunction can put morale, or even the company,\nat risk and impact retention of top talent. Early intervention limits damages\nand quickly realigns company operations with company values.\n\n**Honesty Is Caring**\n\nClear feedback empowers employees to shape their development according to\ntheir goals. Honest dialogue about employee strengths and needed improvements\nhelps employees know what\u2019s working and where to focus on growth.\n\nVague feedback may feel easier to deliver but disserves the employer and\nemployee. \u201cWe need you to be more professional\u201d does not specify the issue as\nattendance, workplace behavior, personal appearance, communication, etc. The\nsupervisor saying, \u201cPlease do your job better,\u201d has not indicated what areas\nof performance are below standard, which are acceptable or what resources can\nassist the employee. Without specific direction, employees do not have what\nthey need to meet expectations and employers are unlikely to get their desired\nresults.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine employee Jane works for a call center. She has completed\ntraining and worked independently for two months. After receiving complaints\nfrom customers, Jane\u2019s supervisor calls Jane to the office. If the supervisor\nsays, \u201cJane, you need to work on your phone skills,\u201d does Jane know what\nspecifically needs improvement? If the supervisor says, \u201cJane, I\u2019d like you to\ndevelop your ability to ask probing questions to meet our customers\u2019 needs\nefficiently and accurately,\u201d Jane knows the specific way she needs to develop.\nIf the supervisor adds, \u201cLet\u2019s review some of your calls and discuss them\ntogether,\u201d then Jane can hear even more precisely where she missed\nopportunities to engage customers, and she\u2019ll have concrete examples of the\nkind of thinking and problem-solving her employer needs. Rather than\ndiscouraging Jane, this conversation can encourage Jane that she\u2019s performing\nwell _and_ that her employer believes she is both worth further investment and\ncapable of growth.\n\n**Accountability Plus Support**\n\nIn the above example, accountability paired with support offers the ultimate\nperformance management toolkit. Jane knows where she needs to improve, and she\nknows what resources can help her. She understands that her supervisor expects\nimprovements, and she knows her supervisor has confidence in her.\n\nSome supervisors lean toward support, rarely holding employees accountable. If\nemployees have no consequences for poor performance, what incentivizes them to\nimprove short of their own intrinsic motivators? Support without\naccountability enables employees to coast, without opportunity to learn or\ngrow.\n\nOther supervisors lean toward accountability, rarely offering support. Without\nsupervisor support, employees can feel targeted and paranoid, impairing their\nability to self-reflect or flourish. Accountability without support is\npunitive, creating a \u201cgotcha\u201d environment rather than a collaborative culture\nof growth.\n\nNeither enabling nor \u201cgotcha\u201d strategies benefit employees or companies.\nIdeally, supervisors are clear about their expectations and about available\nresources for employee improvement. This gives employees a map for success and\nthe right tools to achieve their goals.\n\n**Smart Hiring**\n\nPerformance management processes have the potential to uncover trends among\n(un)successful employees, which can inform and empower HR to recruit better\nfor job and cultural fit. If employees with particular kinds of experience\ntransition well into your company\u2019s industry, you know you can broaden your\napplicant pool without sacrificing quality. If employees with certain\npersonalities or demeanors function well in your environment, you can better\nidentify other teammates who can thrive as well.\n\nWhether housed with HR or otherwise, performance management data trends have\nmuch to teach HR. In partnership, these two areas have profound potential to\nstrengthen retention and company culture.\n\nIdeally, employee culture keeps focus on your company\u2019s mission and your\nsupport for the team doing the work. Performance management strategies rooted\nin critical feedback empower employees to thrive at every level, now and for\nmany years to come.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Courtney Pace, Ph.D.](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2020/01/courtneypace_avatar_1579115328.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/courtneypace/\n\"Photo of Courtney Pace, Ph.D.\")\n\n[Courtney Pace,\nPh.D.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/courtneypace/)\n\nAVP of Talent at FedEx Employees Credit Association, overseeing talent\nmanagement, development, and succession planning.\n[www.fecca.com](https://fecca.com/).

A good CFO could save a company; a bad one\nmight bury it. The covid-19 pandemic presents a different challenge\u2014and\nhighlights the role of another corporate function, often unfairly dismissed as\nsoft. Never before have more firms needed a hard-headed HR boss.\n\nThe duties of chief people officers, as human-resources heads are sometimes\ncalled, look critical right now. They must keep employees healthy; maintain\ntheir morale; oversee a vast remote-working experiment; and, as firms\nretrench, consider whether, when and how to lay workers off. Their in-trays\nare bulging.\n\nOnce derided as \u201cpay and parties\u201d managers, by the early 1990s HR chiefs\nturned to compliance, keeping firms out of the courts (and papers). A\nsubsequent string of corporate imbroglios elevated their status, notes Patrick\nWright of the University of South Carolina. In the wake of executive-pay\nscandals at companies such as WorldCom and Tyco in the 2000s they became more\ninvolved in remuneration. A decade later bungled successions, for example at\nHP, a printer-maker which sacked two bosses in as many years, left them with a\nbigger say in filling top jobs. In the past few years they have dealt with\ncompanies\u2019 often very public \u201cme too\u201d troubles.\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20200328_WBC877.png)\n\nAs recruiting and retaining skilled workers became chief executives\u2019 big\npreoccupation\u2014four-fifths now worry about skill shortages, up from half in\n2012\u2014HR heads\u2019 desks moved ever closer to the corner office. Today many reside\nright next to the boss. Shareholders are inviting more outside HR chiefs to\nboards. In America their salaries remain lower than CFOs\u2019 but have risen 20%\nfaster since 2010 (see chart).\n\nA higher profile entails new expectations. HR was once the domain of history\ngraduates and masters in labour relations; nowadays plenty hold business\ndegrees. Although most firms recruit them from HR jobs, more are choosing\noutsiders or unconventional candidates. According to Russell Reynolds\nAssociates, an executive-search firm, HR heads appointed to Fortune 100\ncompanies between 2016 and 2019 were around 50% likelier than earlier hires to\nhave worked abroad, in general management or in finance.\n\nBefore covid-19, tight labour markets and empowered employees pressed\nemployers to understand how to get the most out of their staff, says Dane\nHolmes, a former head of human-capital management at Goldman Sachs, an\ninvestment bank, who now runs an HR-analytics firm. Diane Gherson, who runs HR\nat IBM, overhauled the computing giant\u2019s performance management using big\ndata. Algorithms now challenge IBM managers\u2019 instincts on pay and promotion,\nand alert Ms Gherson\u2019s team when staff are at risk of fleeing (often before\nthey realise it themselves).\n\nThe pandemic makes such \u201cpeople analytics\u201d more relevant. Beth Galetti, Ms\nGherson\u2019s opposite number at Amazon, an engineer with no HR experience before\njoining the e-commerce titan, oversees 1,000 developers working exclusively on\nHR software. Amazon\u2019s pre-outbreak investment in digital induction for fresh\nhires is paying off. \u201cWe on-boarded 1,700 new corporate employees on [March\n16th] alone,\u201d Ms Galetti reports.\n\nCovid-19 may lead more HR chiefs to adopt such systems. In the short run many\nhave more pressing problems. Mala Singh, chief people officer at EA, a maker\nof video games, represents the c-suite on the team tasked with pandemic\nresponse. This now occupies 60-70% of her (long) day. Her team has been\ngetting staff desks, computers, even noise-cancelling headphones. A bigger\nconcern was balancing work with child care. Ms Singh told the caregivers on EA\nstaff to take as much time as they need to adapt without using up paid leave.\nShe is digitally monitoring employee sentiment, particularly anxiety. In a\ncreative business like EA\u2019s, \u201chaving someone stressed about their family\nsituation does not enable productive work\u201d, she explains.\n\nMany companies, especially outside the knowledge economy, face tougher\nchoices. HR leaders must strike a balance between a firm\u2019s professed purpose,\nwhich these days often involves treating staff decently, and the bottom line,\nobserves Dan Kaplan of Korn Ferry, a consultancy. The instinct is to cut costs\nthrough mass redundancies, as some hotel chains, airlines and others have\nbegun doing. Rather than slash payrolls indiscriminately, says Bill Schaninger\nof McKinsey, another consultancy, good HR heads can use the crisis to\nreconfigure company workflow: what needs to be done by whom, what can be\nautomated and what requires people to share the same space. Some workers who\nat first appear redundant may be redeployed or reskilled.\n\nThe most far-sighted HR-ers at the most resilient companies are already\nstarting to look beyond the flattened curve. Although not quite\nrecruiting\u2014times are too uncertain\u2014Ms Gherson has begun to court talent at\nrival firms.

Entrepreneur and investor\nChristoph Auer-Welsbach, the former partner at IBM Ventures, also joins Kaizo\nas a co-founder. Kaizo was started in 2018 by Dominik Blattner, an\nentrepreneur with over a decade of experience building highly-scalable\ncustomer service applications.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834b422a740.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n\"In our current social climate, customer support is an integral part of a\ncompany's stability and growth that has embraced remote work to meet the\ndemands of a globalized customer base,\" said Dominik Blattner, founder of\nKaizo. \"With the rise of support teams utilizing a digital workplace,\nproviding standards to measure an agent's performance has never been more\nimportant. KPIs provide these standards, quantifying the success, achievement,\nand contribution of each team member.\"\n\nKaizo has already onboarded over five hundred companies and thousands of\ncustomer support agents allowing them to leverage AI and gamification to work\nremotely more effectively and focus on common goals to drive the best possible\nexperience for their customers. The Kaizo platform takes a bottom-up approach,\nusing AI and level-based gamification to actively guide customer support\nagents towards making a greater impact in their company.\n\nChristoph Auer-Welsbach, Kaizo's co-founder said, \"The idea of a quantified\nworkforce, where your successes and failures are given a value seems\nmotivating and engaging. But in reality, it can be the opposite when combined\nwith the absence of a physical work environment. Kaizo offers a unique\nsolution that enables a company to empower their agents to deliver the best\nperformance while retaining them over the long term, and lets managers adapt\nto fast-changing environments based on data and a gamified engagement\nplatform.\"\n\nKaizo enables actionable OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) on an agent level.\nThe platform matches a client's performance metrics in real-time with a\ngamified point system that agents can trigger by achieving personal weekly\ngoals which they set and manage on their own. The product is fully integrated\ninto a team's existing workflow and gives agents real-time feedback with an AI\ncoach and personal ninja avatar. This point-based gamification element makes\nit easier than ever for managers to measure agent performance against KPIs,\nregardless of the external influences of remote work. For agents, it creates a\ncommunity feeling within the workplace that is engaging and motivating. Over\ntime, this unified, in-game digital work environment increases agent's\nengagement, retention, and overall performance.\n\n**HR News:[Greenhouse and Textio Partner to Simplify the Hiring Process for\nRecruiters](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/recruitment-\nonboarding/greenhouse-and-textio-partner-to-simplify-hiring-process-for-\nrecruiters/)**\n\n\"We're excited about Kaizo's novel approach to applying AI to existing ticket\ndata from platforms like Zendesk and Salesforce to optimize the customer\nsupport workflow,\" said Darian Shirazi, General Partner at Gradient Ventures.\n\"Using machine learning, Kaizo understands which behaviors in customer service\ntickets lead to better outcomes for customers and then guides agents to\nreplicate that using ongoing game mechanics. Customer support and service\nplatforms today are failing to leverage data in the right way to make the life\nof agents easier and more effective. The demand Kaizo has seen since they\nlaunched on the Zendesk Marketplace shows agents have been waiting for such a\nsolution for some time.\"\n\n\"At a time when call centers worldwide are under a great deal of stress and\npressure, it's essential for companies to nurture their customer service\nagents, train them, optimize their everyday activities and maximize customer\nsatisfaction, but more importantly to develop, motivate and retain them as\nindividuals. We support Christoph and Dominik's vision to bring an AI-driven\nrevolution to the jobs of millions of customer service agents around the\nworld, by acting in real-time inside their existing CRM or customer support\nsolution. We're thrilled to join their journey as a company that will make a\ndifference for an entire generation of workers,\" said Romain Lavault, General\nPartner at Partech.\n\n**HR News:[Fierce Conversations New Launch Focuses On Improving Employee\nExperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/employee-engagement/fierce-\nconversations-new-launch-focuses-on-improving-employee-experience/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fperformance-\nmanagement-hcm%2Fperformance-management-platform-kaizo-raises-3m-in-\nfunding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Performance+Management+Platform%2C+Kaizo+Raises+%243M+in+Funding\n\"Share this News on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Performance+Management+Platform%2C+Kaizo+Raises+%243M+in+Funding&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fperformance-\nmanagement-hcm%2Fperformance-management-platform-kaizo-raises-3m-in-\nfunding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this News on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fperformance-\nmanagement-hcm%2Fperformance-management-platform-kaizo-raises-3m-in-\nfunding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this News on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fperformance-\nmanagement-hcm%2Fperformance-management-platform-kaizo-raises-3m-in-\nfunding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this News on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-email-\nicon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Performance Management Platform, Kaizo Raises $3M\nin Funding&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fperformance-\nmanagement-hcm%2Fperformance-management-platform-kaizo-raises-3m-in-\nfunding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this News via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Performance Management & HCM ](/category/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/ \"Performance Management & HCM\")\n\n  * [ ![5 Performance Management Trends from Gartner, Mercer, Gallup, BetterWorks, and HBR](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/5_performance_management_trends_from_gartner_mercer_gallup_betterworks_and_hbr_5e57dccfb4502.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-hcm/important-performance-management-trends/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 5 Performance Management Trends from Gartner, Mercer, Gallup,\nBetterWorks, and HBR ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/important-performance-management-\ntrends/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nHere five key performance management trends from Gartner, Mercer, Gallup,\nBetterWorks, and HBR that are poised to reshape HR this year.\n\nby [Chiradeep BasuMallick](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/chiradeep-\nbasumallick/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Feb 27, 2020\n\n  * [ ![How Skill Development Can Meet the Demands of Automation: Q&A With JFF\u2019s Maria Flynn](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/jobs_of_the_future_hr_talk_interview_545_x_240_px_5dd3c79f72c0a.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/performance-management-hcm/maria-flynn-jff-skill-development-and-training/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How Skill Development Can Meet the Demands of Automation: Q&A; With\nJFF\u2019s Maria Flynn ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/maria-flynn-jff-skill-development-and-\ntraining/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nMaria Flynn, CEO of JFF, talks about why skill development is the need of the\nhour.

Because you will deliver the\nmessage remotely, you must take extra care to break the news with empathy and\ncompassion. Your aim is to treat people with dignity, fairness, and respect.\nOffer a short explanation about the economic conditions that led to the\nlayoff. Stress that the dismissal is not the employee's fault. Rather, it's\nthe result of a global circumstance none of created. Even if you're worried\nthat you, too, might lose your job, don't make the situation about you. Find\nsomeone to vent to--a peer or mentor perhaps, and an outlet for your stress.\nBut don't allow your personal pressures to creep into your interactions with\nyour team. As a manager, you need to be there for your people.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/04/Apr20_07_MaxwellHolyoke-\nHirsch.jpg) Illustration by Maxwell Holyoke-Hirsch\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/04/how-to-manage-coronavirus-layoffs-with-\ncompassion?language=es)\n\nWe\u2019ve made our [coronavirus coverage](/insight-\ncenter/coronavirus?ab=articlewidget-insightcenter-coronavirus) free for all\nreaders. To get all of HBR\u2019s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the\n[Daily Alert](/email-newsletters?ab=articlewidget-newsletter-\ncoronavirus&movetile=dailyalert) newsletter.\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic continues to evolve, the damage to the job market\nlooks likely to be deep and long lasting. Managers are not only dealing with\nthe stress and sadness of having to let go of a large number of their workers,\nmany of them are also feeling underlying anxiety about their own positions.\nEven if laying off employees is the only way to keep the organization running,\nhow do you handle your feelings of guilt and sadness? How should you deliver\nthe news when you can\u2019t meet face-to-face? What should you say to your\nemployees who remain? And what can you do to manage fear about your own\nfuture?\n\n### **What the Experts Say**\n\nLaying off employees is difficult in normal times; but amidst the Covid-19\nglobal health crisis, the task is \u201cemotionally and cognitively overwhelming,\u201d\naccording to Joshua Margolis, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cThis\nexperience for most of us is unfathomable,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of\nuncertainty and people\u2019s minds are whirring.\u201d As a manager charged with\ndismissing a wide swath of employees, \u201cyou\u2019re pulled in different directions:\nYour heart goes out to people, but you have a responsibility to the\norganization.\u201d That tension is magnified when you\u2019re also worried about your\nown fate, says Kenneth Freeman, Dean Emeritus at Boston University\u2019s Questrom\nSchool of Business. \u201cYou\u2019re human and you\u2019re going to have a lot of those 2 AM\nmoments,\u201d he says. But the key is to try as best you can to separate your\npersonal worries from the task at hand. \u201cIn your role as a manager, you need\nto be there for your people.\u201d Here are some recommendations.\n\n### **Leaders: Reflect on whether layoffs are needed**\n\nIf you\u2019re the one making the decisions about layoffs, Margolis recommends\nasking yourself one question: [is downsizing your workforce truly\nnecessary?](/2020/03/the-coronavirus-crisis-doesnt-have-to-lead-to-layoffs)\nThe impulse to cut costs is understandable, but \u201cthis is not a periodic\nrecession.\u201d Rather, this pandemic represents \u201can exceptional historic moment\nthat will end up being pivotal for the economy and for people\u2019s communities,\ncareers, and lives,\u201d and it might \u201cwarrant a different response.\u201d As a leader,\nyou need to spark \u201cresourceful, creative thinking about how your organization\ncan save as many jobs as possible.\u201d Freeman suggests gathering your management\nteam and asking, \u201cCan we make sacrifices elsewhere? What are our other options\nto [reduce costs](/2020/03/a-5-day-plan-to-keep-your-company-afloat?ab=hero-\nsubleft-3)?\u201d Your goal is to think broadly about how you distribute the\nwidespread negative consequences of Covid-19. \u201cLaying off people should be the\nlast resort,\u201d he says. And if you must do layoffs, make every effort to \u201cavoid\nmultiple rounds\u201d of cuts.\n\n### **Gather information**\n\nIf you decide layoffs are necessary or others have made that decision for you,\nthen make sure you\u2019re prepared before you reach out to the affected employees.\nFigure out \u201chow and when you will deliver the news to your employees on an\nindividual basis\u201d and what the message will consist of, says Freeman. People\nare likely going to have [a lot of questions about the timing, their benefits,\nand severance](/2020/03/7-questions-to-raise-immediately-after-youre-laid-\noff). These conversations may need to happen fast, but you\u2019ll have a better\nchance of easing your own and the employee\u2019s anxiety if you can provide them\nwith answers about what happens next. Reach out to HR, your legal department,\nand any other senior leaders who might be able to help you prepare answers to\nquestions such as \u201cWhen will I get my last paycheck?\u201d and \u201cWhat happens to my\n401K?\u201d\n\n### **Understand your limitations**\n\nEven if you\u2019ve presided over layoffs in the past, overseeing them during the\ncoronavirus outbreak will be different for one key reason: they won\u2019t take\nplace in person because of social distancing measures. What\u2019s more, you need\nto have a highly private conversation at a time when privacy is difficult to\nachieve. \u201cWe all have families under foot and lots of things going on,\u201d says\nMargolis. He suggests asking your employee, \u201cIs there a time when I can get 15\nminutes of your full attention?\u201d Be forewarned: you may get pushback. They may\nanticipate what\u2019s coming and \u201csome people aren\u2019t going to have the\npsychological wherewithal to deal with it,\u201d he says. In this case, he\nrecommends saying something like, \u201cCan you let me know when you\u2019re ready to\nhave this conversation so I can tell you the next steps?\u201d\n\n### **Set the right tone**\n\nBecause you will deliver the message remotely, Freeman says that you must\n[take extra care to break the news \u201cwith empathy and\ncompassion](/2016/02/a-guide-to-being-compassionate-during-layoffs).\u201d Your aim\nis to \u201ctreat people with dignity, fairness, and respect.\u201d Even though you may\nworry that you, too, might get laid-off, this particular termination is not\nabout you. \u201cThis is not a time for you to take up space,\u201d says Margolis. Don\u2019t\nsuccumb to your insecurities by saying something like, \u201cThis is really hard\nfor me.\u201d At the same time, don\u2019t \u201ctotally detach from your humanity\u201d so that\nyou \u201cbecome a mechanical robot.\u201d Instead, find a way \u201cto engage your emotion\u201d\nand cultivate a \u201ccalm and low-key\u201d manner. Ideally, you will have the\nconversation via video link so that you can \u201cmake eye contact\u201d with the other\nperson. If the conversation takes place on the phone, free yourself of all\ndistractions. \u201cBe fully present and listen.\u201d\n\n### **Be direct and human**\n\nYour message should be \u201cclear, concise, and unequivocal,\u201d says Margolis. For\ninstance, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but at end of next week we are terminating your job.\u201d\nImparting an \u201cexpeditious, direct message can feel cold, but it allows the\nother person to process what you\u2019re saying,\u201d he says. Express gratitude for\ntheir hard work and dedication. Then offer a short and simple explanation\nabout the economic conditions that led to the layoff. \u201cStress that this is not\nabout a specific job performance,\u201d says Freeman. \u201cThis is not the employee\u2019s\nfault. [This is about a global circumstance](/2020/03/understanding-the-\neconomic-shock-of-coronavirus) that none of us created.\u201d Acknowledge, too,\nthat one of the difficult things about being laid off during this crisis is\nthat coworkers won\u2019t get a chance to say goodbye in person. For a lot people,\n\u201ccolleagues are part of their extended family.\u201d Try to convey the message, \u201cWe\nall care about you.\u201d\n\n### **Offer assistance \u2014 but don\u2019t overpromise**\n\nFreeman recommends \u201cbeing readily available\u201d and willing to provide \u201csupport\nand counsel\u201d to your employee even after the initial conversation. Recognize\nthat this person may need time to process the news and [may have\nquestions](/2020/03/7-questions-to-raise-immediately-after-youre-laid-off) for\nyou later. \u201cThey might come back to reconnect or seek your advice.\u201d Be\nhelpful. Provide information on where your employee should go for government\nbenefits. Offer ideas about job opportunities at other organizations. Offer to\nserve as a reference. But, cautions Margolis, \u201cdon\u2019t overcommit to things you\ncan\u2019t deliver.\u201d For instance, \u201cyou may feel tempted to say, \u2018As things get\nclearer, and the economy improves, you\u2019re on our list to come back,\u2019\u201d he says.\nBut no one has that kind of foresight. \u201cDon\u2019t sugarcoat and don\u2019t give false\nhope.\u201d\n\n### **Be transparent**\n\nIn times like these, your remaining employees will look to you for comfort \u2014\nand an explanation, says Freeman. \u201cThe survivors are going to be worried about\ntheir jobs,\u201d he says. The fact is, \u201cno one knows where this is going to end,\u201d\nso the \u201conus is on you to be as transparent as possible.\u201d He recommends you\nhold an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d session \u2014 an open forum of sorts \u2014 so that \u201crumors\ndon\u2019t take over.\u201d You will need \u201ca succinct explanation for why the layoffs\nwere necessary,\u201d says Margolis. He recommends something like, \u201cThe\norganization is facing a challenge unlike anything it has ever faced. Let me\ntell you what we did, why we did it, and how we can move on.\u201d Then it\u2019s up to\nyou to \u201cabsorb their tension and agitation\u201d and listen to their concerns. You\nneed to \u201cexude a commitment to continue to move forward,\u201d he says.\n\n### **Vent (selectively)**\n\nThis is an [excruciatingly stressful time for everyone](/2020/03/coping-with-\nfatigue-fear-and-panic-during-a-crisis), and managers often bear an extra\nburden, says Freeman. \u201cYou feel responsible for the livelihoods of your team\nand for the health and wellbeing of their families,\u201d says Freeman. One of the\nmany ways that people \u201ccope with turbulence\u201d is by going to [routines and\nrituals](/2020/04/the-restorative-power-of-ritual), says Margolis. But because\nof widespread lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders, our routines \u201chave been\ndisrupted.\u201d It\u2019s critical, therefore, that you have \u201ca place where you can\nvent, release tension, and where you deal with your worries.\u201d Find someone\nelse you can talk to \u2014 a peer perhaps, a mentor, or a colleague at a different\norganization. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to articulate in certain circles that you don\u2019t know\nabout your own future and that unleashes worry.\u201d But be selective and cautious\nabout how much stress and emotion you show to your team. \u201cAll eyes are on you\u201d\nto provide a path forward.\n\n### **Focus on your wellbeing**\n\nFinally, take care of yourself, says Margolis. \u201cHopefully, this is the only\ntime you face something of this magnitude. But it\u2019s unlikely to be the only\ntime you face a challenge during a period of great uncertainty.\u201d The best\ncoping mechanism for when you can\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s in store for you is\n[self-care](/2017/06/6-ways-to-weave-self-care-into-your-workday).\u201d Eat\nhealthy, wholesome food; get regular exercise; [try meditating](/2020/03/why-\nleaders-need-meditation-now-more-than-ever); get plenty of sleep at night;\nread a good book. [A little perspective helps too](/2020/03/youre-not-\npowerless-in-the-face-of-uncertainty). After all, \u201cyou are not alone,\u201d says\nFreeman. Unfortunately, \u201cthere are a lot of supervisors going through this.\u201d\n** **\n\n### **Principles to Remember**\n\n**Do:  **\n\n  * Think carefully about whether layoffs are necessary and reflect on ways your organization can save as many jobs as possible.\n  * Show compassion for your employee and stress that the layoff is not their fault.\n  * Seek out a peer or a colleague outside your organization to whom you can vent and ask for help in coping with your own uncertainty.\n\n**Don\u2019t:  **\n\n  * Overcommit. Provide support and counsel to the people you\u2019ve laid off, but don\u2019t promise things you can\u2019t deliver.\n  * Make this about you. Avoid saying things like, \u201cThis is really hard for me.\u201d\n  * Neglect your wellbeing. Make a concerted effort to eat well and get enough sleep, and take time for self-care, including exercise and meditation.\n\n_The cases below are from people who have presided over layoffs in the past.\nWhile the circumstances today are unique, hopefully the previous experience of\nleaders provides some helpful lessons._\n\n### **Case Study #1: Part of your job is to absorb the emotion**\n\nLeah Solivan, the founder and former CEO of TaskRabbit, the online marketplace\nthat lets people hire freelancers for odd jobs, says the recent rash of\nlayoffs due to the coronavirus crisis is giving her ugly flashbacks. \u201cI feel\nlike I have PTSD,\u201d she says. \u201cI know exactly how these founders and managers\nfeel.\u201d\n\nLeah founded TaskRabbit just a few months before the global financial crisis\nthat began in 2008; and she oversaw several rounds of layoffs before her\ncompany was acquired by IKEA.\n\nThe year 2014 sticks with her. The economy was improving, but TaskRabbit faced\nan uncertain future. Customers were shifting toward mobile technology and\ncompetition for the platform was intensifying.\n\n#### Further Reading\n\n  * ![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/03/coronavirus_cover.png)\n\n###### [Coronavirus + Business: The Insights You Need from\nHBR](https://store.hbr.org/product/coronavirus-and-business-the-insights-you-\nneed-from-harvard-business-review/10440?sku=10440E-KND-ENG?referral=02560)\n\nLeadership & Managing People FREE EBOOK\n\nAdd to Cart\n\n    * __Save\n    * __Share\n\nLeah realized she couldn\u2019t hold on to the company that she had worked so hard\nto build unless she made big changes. After many agonizing conversations with\nthe company\u2019s five-member executive team, Leah came to the conclusion that she\nneeded to eliminate 20 employees, about 25% of the workforce.\n\n\u201cI knew it was best for the company in the long run, but at the time I was\nliving my worst nightmare,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was letting people down.\u201d\n\nBut Leah understood that these layoffs were not about her. \u201cHowever difficult\nit was for the team and I to make the decision, I knew it was going to be more\ndifficult for the people I had to let go.\u201d\n\nHer first order of business was to craft a message to the affected employees\nthat was short and succinct. She said something like, \u201cWe are not on a\nsustainable path. In order for the company to be healthy and move forward, we\nneed to reorganize the team and unfortunately not everyone can stay.\u201d\n\nLeah met with each employee individually and offered compassionate support,\nincluding a generous severance package. She also worked her network to help\ndeparting employees find new job opportunities. \u201cI wanted to take care of\nthese people so they could make a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nAfter, she talked with her remaining team members and offered to answer any\nquestions. \u201cAt the end of that day, we had a companywide meeting where people\ngot up and said what was on their minds. Some said, \u2018I feel sad,\u2019 or \u2018I feel\nangry,\u2019 or \u2018I feel disappointed.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy to hear those things, Leah admits. \u201cMy job was to absorb it,\u201d\nshe says. \u201cAnd I felt like a failure.\u201d\n\nPreserving her own mental health and resilience was a challenge. She recalls\nventing to her executive team. The camaraderie helped. \u201cWe were all in the\ntrenches together.\u201d\n\nToday Leah invests in startups as a VC at Fuel Capital. Lately, she has been\noffering guidance to companies as they face similar challenges. \u201cThere\u2019s no\nway around it: layoffs are hard,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the most difficult thing I\nhad to do.\u201d ** **\n\n### **Case Study #2: Offer compassionate support and express gratitude**\n\nAs a longtime veteran of the HR industry, Carla Yudhishthu has overseen\nseveral corporate downsizings over the course of her career. It never gets\neasier. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to be as honest as you can and treat people with\ndignity, but you have to manage your own emotions and your own fears, too,\u201d\nsays Carla.\n\nShe remembers a round of layoffs early in her career that was particularly\ndifficult. The year was 2003. She was working for a publicly held medical\ndevice business in the Bay Area that had already underwent a round of layoffs\nin 2001.\n\n\u201cWe hoped we would only have to do it once, but the company was facing a lot\nof problems and we needed to have multiple iterations,\u201d she says.\n\nAs an HR manager, Carla was tasked with laying off dozens of employees \u2014\nincluding several people on her team. \u201cI had to tell my colleague who was 20\nyears older than me and had a family that he no longer had a job,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Who am I do to this? Will I be ok?\u2019\u201d\n\nCarla remembers [practicing what she would say](/2015/06/how-to-tell-someone-\ntheyre-being-laid-off). \u201cYou need to get through the pragmatic details,\u201d she\nsays. \u201cBut it\u2019s emotional and when someone reacts emotionally you can lose\ntrack of what you have to say.\u201d\n\nCarla says she approached the layoffs with humility and honesty. She also\nwanted to offer as much help and support as she could. Before breaking the\nnews, she and her colleagues gathered information on to how to access\nunemployment and the limitations on COBRA benefits. \u201cWe put a lot of thought\ninto what the message should be,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we tried to anticipate any\nquestions that people might have.\u201d\n\nShe received reassurance from her unit\u2019s leadership that her job was safe. But\nher cortisol levels remained high. To cope, she compartmentalized the task at\nhand. \u201cFrom 7:30AM to 5:30PM, I needed to think about the organization; I\ncould worry about myself after that,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI remember doing lots of deep breathing, and lots of running and yoga.\u201d\n\nCommunicating the news to the remaining employees was another challenge. She\nand her colleagues in HR were transparent. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t make promises because\nwe knew our company needed get out of the woods,\u201d she says. \u201cWe wanted to give\neveryone confidence that everything was going to be ok. But we couldn\u2019t. No\none was secure.\u201d\n\nThat company eventually closed and today Carla is the VP of People Operations\nat Mammoth HR and ThinkHR. Her advice for managers overseeing layoffs today:\n\u201cTry to create a personal connection.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrite your employees a thank you note to express your gratitude and\nappreciation and say goodbye,\u201d she says. \u201cAt a time [like this], it\u2019s a\ngesture that will be remembered.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n[Rebecca Knight](/search?term=rebecca%20knight&search_type=search-all) is a\nfreelance journalist in Boston and a lecturer at Wesleyan University.

So what is the disconnect?\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | March 17, 2020\n\nTopics: [Digital Transformation](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/digital-\ntransformation/) | [Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/hrtechnology/) |\n[Leadership](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/leadership/)\n\n_Tom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/83424484_m.jpg)\n\nInjecting new or updated technology into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover US$5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a US$250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% said the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, said Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner.\n\nTinder said her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe said. In fairness, she noted, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn\u2019t matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder said. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don\u2019t have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d\n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, said that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she said, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille said.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explained.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explained. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he added.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte said, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he said, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears said. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nSears said traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder said, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears said, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook said, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he said. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook said. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook said HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concluded. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Dissecting+the+employer+disconnect+in+HR+technology&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

times of COVID-19, many businesses have turned to the work-from-home option\nto help contain the spread of and safeguard employees from the coronavirus.\n\nSurveying over 7000 employees in Hong Kong, Culture Amp's latest survey\nrevealed that remote workers are far more engaged than non-remote workers.\n\nOverall, remote workers in Hong Kong have a much greater sense of company\npride, belonging, motivation and are more likely to want to stay in their\ncurrent role.\n\nKey findings:\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/07110844/Screen-\nShot-2020-04-07-at-11.08.10-AM-266x180.png)\n\n\n\n\"There are many benefits to remote and flexible work reflected in these\nfindings. Remote work encourages greater self-empowerment. There\u2019s no manager\nbreathing down employees\u2019 necks. It\u2019s really up to the individual to get the\njob done, which breeds a sense of accomplishment and pride. The more a person\nfeels like they\u2019re achieving something worthwhile, the more connected they\nfeel to a business,\" said Katy Stevens, vice president at Culture Amp APAC.\n\nAmid COVID-19, apart from leaning into apps and drop-in sessions, the employee\nsurvey startup's CEO and co-founder Didier Elzinga also produces a short daily\nvideo to update everyone on the situation and market trends.\n\nIn the survey, the only area where remote workers fall slightly below their\nnon-remote counterparts in Hong Kong is respect (-3). Stevens said the lack of\n\u201cface-to-face\u201d time or lack of insight into the habits/productivity of remote\nworkers could be the potential reason why employees might feel less respect\nfrom their managers while working from home.\n\nEmployees may sense their managers perceiving them as \u201cslacking off\u201d, which\ntranslates to slightly less respect \u2013 especially in a place like Hong Kong\nwhere burning the midnight oil remains an ingrained cultural measure of an\nemployee\u2019s commitment to their job.\n\n\"It\u2019s really important for employers to make a mindset shift. Presenteeism is\nnot an accurate measure of a person\u2019s performance. Instead, consider an\napproach that includes employee feedback, goal attainment and skill growth as\nmeasures of an individual\u2019s contribution and overall performance,\" Stevens\nsaid.\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

Shutterstock\n\n**As UK employee engagement and productivity levels remain stubbornly low,\nStuart Hearn explains why improving engagement levels is a job for the whole\nbusiness, not just HR.**\n\nHR leaders are all too familiar with the yearly engagement survey. But\nengagement surveys which have accurate and useful results are more of a\nnovelty.\n\nIncreasingly, HR understands that such surveys only reflect how an employee is\nfeeling in that current moment. They aren\u2019t an accurate representation of what\nengagement has been like throughout the whole year.\n\nSenior managers know they want high employee engagement, but when the surveys\nhave negative responses, businesses react with engagement initiatives \u2013 which\nmay or may not do the trick. When they don\u2019t, it\u2019s usually HR who are held\nresponsible.\n\nHR should act as facilitators by supporting staff and providing them with the\nappropriate tools to reflect on, measure and boost their own engagement\u201d\n\nHR, traditionally, have been the gatekeepers of this rather uninspiring\nprocess. In reality, employee engagement shouldn\u2019t solely be the\nresponsibility of HR \u2013 it should be everyone\u2019s.\n\nFor employee engagement to be high, you need the right conditions. Senior\nleaders are responsible for setting out the culture, which means they need to\ncreate a culture in which engagement is a priority. Managers work directly\nwith employees and should ensure their employees are immersed in their work.\nEmployees need to be open and honest about how engaged they are with their\nmanagers. And HR? HR should act as facilitators by supporting staff and\nproviding them with the appropriate tools to reflect on, measure and boost\ntheir own engagement.\n\n## Senior leaders must drive the cultural shift\n\nStudies have shown that a good company culture can increase revenue. For\nexample, one study which looked at 200 companies revealed that those with\n_[performance-enhancing cultures had, on average, a 682% revenue\ngrowth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkotter/2011/02/10/does-corporate-\nculture-drive-financial-performance/#69c1205a7e9e)_ compared to 166% in\ncompanies that didn\u2019t.\n\nSenior leaders set the tone for the culture of an organisation, and to make\nsure it\u2019s one in which engagement can thrive, there are a few things they must\ndo:\n\n## Ongoing engagement\n\nEmployee engagement isn\u2019t a one-time thing. We can\u2019t expect a snapshot of\nsomeone\u2019s engagement to last for the entire year. If engagement is measured\nannually, it risks being skewed by outlier data. People may be genuinely\nengaged and committed to their work but suffering from a stinking cold on\nsurvey day. They might have had a horrible commute, or a family bereavement,\nor too many glasses of wine the night before. Measuring engagement frequently\nand regularly will mitigate this, as long as it\u2019s done in a low-touch way that\ndoesn\u2019t pull people out of the flow of work.\n\n## Practise what you preach\n\nMost people in an organisation look up to senior leadership for guidance.\nLeaders need to set an example. They need to demonstrate that engagement is\nimportant to them by acting on the insights they get. Perhaps most\nimportantly, they need to base those actions in work, and work outcomes. If\nthe result of an engagement initiative is a coffee machine or a yoga class,\nthat may make people happier in the short term, but it won\u2019t move the needle\nin a lasting way.\n\n## Direct managers must understand and motivate their employees\n\nAccording to Gallup, managers account for over 70% of the variance in employee\nengagement. Employees with highly engaged managers are 59% more likely to be\nengaged than employees supervised by actively disengaged managers. Managers\nplay an integral role in ensuring employee engagement because they have a\ncloser relationship with employees than senior leaders and HR. They understand\ntheir employees\u2019 day-to-day work and should have some responsibility in\nensuring that they feel motivated. It\u2019s important for managers to create an\nenvironment in which employees can openly discuss their work and how they are\nfeeling.\n\nOne way in which managers could do this is by taking a _[coaching\napproach](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231581/five-ways-improve-employee-\nengagement.aspx)_ to understand each employee\u2019s strengths and help them use\nthose in their role. According to _[Gallup](https://hbr.org/2015/04/what-\ngreat-managers-do-to-engage-employees)_ , employees who feel their manager is\ninvested in them as people are more likely to be engaged. Each person is\ndifferent, with different challenges. Recognising your employees\u2019\ncontributions and seeking out their opinions and ideas can help them feel\nempowered and engaged.\n\nPerformance management is also linked to engagement. Employees with _[managers\nwho excel at performance management](https://hbr.org/2015/04/what-great-\nmanagers-do-to-engage-employees)_ activities are more engaged than employees\nwhose managers struggle with these tasks. If managers talk to their employees,\nand provide clarity on goals and objectives, they\u2019re already creating the\nenvironment for work engagement.\n\n## Employees must be responsible for their own engagement\n\nEmployees play a critical role in their own engagement. It\u2019s vital that they\nreflect on their own state of mind \u2013 and how it applies to their work \u2013 and\nuse that to prompt discussion with their manager. This is work engagement at\nits purest: the positive loop whereby the employee and manager find ways to\nnavigate obstacles and take advantage of opportunities. It\u2019s _[performance\nmanagement feeding engagement](https://resources.clearreview.com/powering-\nperformance-engagement-ebook)_.\n\nA study by _[Amabile and Kramer](https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-\nwins)_ underlines this: it found that people feel motivated by what they\ndescribe as a \u201cprogress-loop.\u201d When we make progress towards something that\nmatters to us, we feel motivated to continue \u2013 causing further progress.\n\nFinally, creating a space for \u201cflow\u201d \u2013 a term coined by psychologist _[Mihaly\nCsikzsentmihalyi](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224927532_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience)_\n\u2013 is a state in which a person is so completely immersed in an activity that\nthey lose a sense of time and forget about demands that aren\u2019t related to the\ncurrent task. These can include tasks that are meaningful to you and require\nyour full concentration \u2013 allowing you to feel in control and invigorated.\n\n## HR should hold everyone accountable\n\nHR plays an essential role in ensuring that engagement initiatives run\nsmoothly. A key part should be to support managers and employees with the\nright tools and learning opportunities. HR should hold managers accountable\nfor ensuring that engagement initiatives are followed through. But also, they\nneed to ensure that senior leaders and managers are engaged at work, otherwise\nthis could have a knock down effect on employees. According to research by\nTowards Maturity, three in five L&D leaders said one of the biggest barriers\nto success for engagement initiatives was management\u2019s engagement.\n\nHowever, there are tools that can help HR capture more accurate information\nabout the state of play in an organisation. It\u2019s possible to identify which\nmanagers or employees aren\u2019t having regular conversations or may be struggling\nto create effective goals. You can also view engagement data at a team or\nmacro-level, which can guide the development of EAPs or wellness initiatives.\nMost importantly, it puts engagement in the context of performance, ensuring\nthat employee engagement is grounded in work outcomes. The role of the manager\nand their relationship with the employee is crucial here. HR doesn\u2019t need to\nbe the engagement police: they should be enablers of business value, with\nengagement as one of the metrics they have to play with.\n\n## Latest HR job opportunities on Personnel Today\n\n  \n[**Browse more human resources\njobs**](https://jobs.personneltoday.com/landingpage/1401583260/human-\nresources-jobs/)\n\n![Stuart Hearn](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2020/03/Stuart-Hearn.jpg)\n\n#### About Stuart Hearn\n\nStuart Hearn is founder and CEO of [Clear\nReview](https://www.clearreview.com/)\n\n[ View all posts by Stuart Hearn ->\n](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/author/stuarthearn/)\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/russell-group-graduates-\nless-likely-to-need-work-experience-to-get-a-job/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/how-banks-can-balance-\nstability-and-innovation/)\n\n##### No comments yet.\n\n### Leave a Reply [Click here to cancel reply.](/hr/responsibility-for-\nemployee-engagement-hr/#respond)\n\nComment\n\nName (required)\n\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\n\nWebsite\n\n### Related posts:\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2019/06/peer-\nto-peer-tipping.jpg)What risks arise from employee 'tipping'\napps?](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/what-risks-arise-from-employee-\ntipping-apps/ \"What risks arise from employee \u2018tipping\u2019 apps?\")\n\nPeer-to-peer \"tipping\" schemes are rising in popularity in the workplace, but\nthese \"recognise and reward\" programmes should come with a...\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/06/clocking-in-635.jpg)When does keeping tabs on\nworking time overstep the line?](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/when-does-\nkeeping-tabs-on-working-time-overstep-the-line/ \"When does keeping tabs on\nworking time overstep the line?\")\n\nA recent ECJ case means employers will need to more closely track employee\ntime at work.

It aimed to bridge the\ngap between school-level education and workplace requirements.\n\nDepending on the median educational qualification available in your region,\nand the day-to-day requirements of work, the definition of human resource\ndevelopment can vary widely.\n\nFor example, a plan to amplify people's potential for a startup in Silicon\nValley will look very different from a human resource development program\ndesigned for a large factory in China.\n\nIn the early days, HRD would involve rigorous hands-on training focused on the\nacquisition of hard skills. Today, the picture is different.\n\nThe skills profile of top-tier talent is highly layered, comprising a mix of\nhard and soft skills. HR must pay equal attention to these areas of human\nresource development to bring out an employee's full potential.\n\nIn addition, strategies to improve culture and build a work environment\nconducive to upskilling and self-development also come under HRD. A data-\ndriven mindset might also prove useful, allowing HR to measure learning\nperformance and dynamically update performance benchmarks.\n\nFor these reasons, we recommend an agile approach when defining human resource\ndevelopment for your company, keeping in mind your organization's unique needs\nand its potential to grow.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What Is Learning and Development (L &D;)? Definition,\nObjectives, and Best Practices for\nStrategy**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-\nis-learning-and-development-objectives-strategy/)\n\n## **5 Key Functions of Human Resource Development**\n\nThere are five formal human resource development functions in an HR\ndepartment:\n\n### **1\\. Strategic talent sourcing and acquisition**\n\n  \nThe first step to enhancing your human capital is to spot and onboard the\nright talent. The best candidates may not always have the most experience or\nthe highest number of qualifications. However, they can be good culture adds\nto your organization.\n\nA careful mix of soft skills, personality, and potential will determine\n**[talent sourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-sourcing/)** , and in turn, the effectiveness of\nhuman resource development.\n\nRight from the\n[**onboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) stage, HR begins to equip the\nemployee with the knowledge required to succeed during the employee's tenure\nin the organization.\n\n### **2\\. Education-oriented employee benefits**\n\n  \nA benefits package focused on human resource development will include\nsponsorships for adult education, assistance for tuition fees, flexible hours\nfor those continuing their learning outside of college, and so on.\n\nFor example, the Starbucks College Achievement Plan provides U.S. employees\nwith tuition coverage for specific universities and degrees. DHL offers a\nsimilar benefit in the form of tuition reimbursement for employees applying\nfor online college degrees.\n\n![The functions of human resource development](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. The functions of human resource development**\n\n### **3\\. Performance measurement and management**\n\n  \nPerformance management is at the heart of human resource development.\nEmployees may not always be able to take time out for learning sessions and\nonline courses, which is where a strength-focused [**performance management**\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-hcm/what-is-\nperformance-management/)model kicks in.\n\nManagers regularly review employee performance and share inspiring/coaching\nfeedback. Employees then focus on improving performance, incrementally\nimproving their capabilities. Such a structure requires agility to prove\nuseful.\n\n### **4\\. Formal learning and development programs**\n\n  \nTo complement managers' efforts, you can offer learning and development\nsessions to close specific skills gaps. This must factor in company needs on\nthe one hand and the employee's personal ambitions on the other.\n\nLet's say an employee with leadership potential is interested in the marketing\ndomain. You can assign a learning track that develops both these skill sets\nand gradually helps the employee transition into the marketing department\nwhere they can learn the ropes before taking on that leadership role.\n\n### **5\\. Internal mobility and succession planning**\n\n  \nAn effective human resource development program will ensure that every\nemployee finds the best-fit job within the organization, in sync with their\ndesires and capabilities.\n\nInternal mobility supports lateral transitions, while a succession plan\nfocuses on developing future leaders. Once again, internal mobility and\nsuccession planning must be supported by hard and soft skills training,\nrespectively.\n\nInterestingly, HRD also takes place informally. Unstructured interactions such\nas informal mentorships and on-the-job collaboration can go a long way in\nstrengthening employee capabilities. However, having a structured, measurable\nprogram in place is essential to the success of a human resource development\nprogram.\n\n## **How to Start a Human Resource Development Program**\n\nThe many functions of human resource development require several stakeholders\nfrom outside the HR department. That's why launching the program could seem\nlike an effort- and time-intensive task.\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of steps that could streamline the process:\n\n### **1\\. Assess internal and external talent potential**\n\n  \nTake stock of your existing workforce and the available talent pool in your\ndomain and region. Estimate hiring timelines for expanding the workforce and\nlaunching the program. To do this, you can use **[HR\nanalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-hr-\nanalytics/)**. Based on the data the analytics engine has, it can identify the\npotential of each employee and help you develop training programs accordingly.\n\n### **2\\. Map human resource training and development objectives**\n\n  \nMake sure to include both near- and long-term objectives in this step. These\nobjectives could range from upskilling for a project that must be closed in\none month to making your workforce more resilient to ongoing digital\ntransformation. Collaborate with the different stakeholders needed to create\nthis employee career development program \u2013 for instance, department heads and\nteam leaders.\n\n### **3\\. Identify the resources need for training and development**\n\n  \nWhat are the tools, resources, time, and external assistance you need to meet\nthe objectives mapped out in the previous step? Carefully outline these\nprocesses to build a sequential strategy that clearly defines the expected\noutcomes.\n\n### **4\\. Speak to stakeholders and obtain buy-in**\n\n  \nThis could include buy-in from the CEO for high-level business targets, from\nthe CIO for digital tools and implementation, from the CFO for budget\napproval, the CHRO to hire external consultants if required, and the like.\n\n### **5\\. Communicate with on-ground execution managers**\n\n  \nThe program will be primarily executed by team leaders, business unit heads,\nand learning practitioners. Conduct workshops with these individuals\nbeforehand to convey the intended objectives of learning and the approach that\nwill be adopted. Ensure that you adapt the plan based on feedback.\n\n### **6\\. Launch the program and review it at regular intervals** :\n\n  \nAfter a specific interval (a robust HRD program will take time to show\ntangible results), conduct an evaluation.\n\n  * What are the program's strengths and weaknesses?\n  * Is the cost-to-benefit ratio in your favor?\n  * Should the plan have a wider deployment?\n\n  \nReview these parameters and relaunch the program after accommodating this\nfeedback.\n\nThese are some of the foundational steps to start a human resource development\nprogram, no matter what your intended vision might be. Let's now look at a set\nof best practices that can help HR across industries to develop their human\ncapital better.\n\n## **8** **Best Practices for Human Resource Training and Development**\n\nThere are several ways to make sure that your human resource training and\ndevelopment strategy hits the mark.\n\nWe specifically mention the training here because on-the-job training is\npivotal to developing employee capabilities in nearly every field. Whether you\nrun a manufacturing plant or supervise an educational institution, whether\nyour company makes softballs or software platforms, the workforce must be\nadequately trained to produce the expected output.\n\nTo achieve this, follow these best practices:\n\n### **1\\. Assign human resource development owners**\n\n  \nThe best strategies can fall flat if there is no ownership for execution.\nThat's why companies must set specific key performance indicators (KPIs) for\ntraining, development, and performance, with process owners who are tasked\nwith improving these metrics. These individuals may be L&D; practitioners in\nthe organization, team leaders, line managers, and the like.\n\n### **2\\. Contain attrition among trained workers by focusing on engagement**\n\n  \nHuman resource training and development involves significant investment per\nemployee, which becomes redundant when a highly trained resource leaves the\norganization. This is where focusing on ancillary HR functions such as\n**[employee engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-engagement/)** , recognition, and culture-building\ncan help prevent **[employee\nattrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-attrition-complete-guide/)**.\n\n### **3\\. Use rewards and recognition to incentivize learning**\n\n  \nRecognition is closely linked with **[employee\nretention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/)** and therefore helps to\ncontain attrition in your workforce. Rewards for course completion and\nsuperior performance can also motivate employees further.\n\n### **4\\. Coordinate pan-organizational development**\n\n  \nTraining and development tracks in different departments/business units should\nnot be planned independently of each other. A centralized approach that keeps\nin mind the progress each department is making can enable the HRD program to\nmeet the company's shared vision and purpose.\n\n### **5\\. Link career progression to development**\n\n  \nCareer progression shouldn't entirely depend on the length of an employee's\ntenure. After training and development sessions, if an employee is seen to be\nan exceptional performer, you can develop a personalized career progression\ntrack for them.\n\n### **6\\. Initiate human resource training and development from day 1**\n\n  \nYou can work together with the recruitment team to embed training into the\n**[onboarding experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/)**. This will give\nnew employees an understanding of your continuous learning culture, making\nlater-stage training much easier.\n\n### **7\\. Avoid a cookie-cutter training and development journey**\n\n  \nOne of the most significant transformations in human resource development is\nthe emerging need for personalization. Today, employees are aware of their\nunique capabilities, which demand personalized and adaptive learning\nmethodologies. Here's where corporate eLearning software can help.\n\n### **8\\. Make the development transferable**\n\n  \nA formal human resource development program should offer certifications,\nmicro-credentials, and even digital badges upon completion. These achievements\nare transferable to other jobs outside the organization and can encourage\nemployees to fast-track the learning process.\n\nThese are some of the best practices that can strengthen your human resource\ndevelopment strategy and make your training initiatives genuinely stick.\n\n## **4 Software Tools to Support Your Human Resource Development Program**\n\nThe HR technology landscape is continuously growing, including learning and\ndevelopment tech. Several of these tools can prove useful to develop a\ncompany's employee potential. So, consider the following platforms when\noutlining your HRD strategy for 2020:\n\n### **1\\. A job shadow enablement software like Grandshake**\n\n  \nNearly 70% of all learning happens via on-the-job experiences. That's why job\nshadowing and apprenticeship have traditionally been integral to human\nresource development.\n\nNow, platforms like Grandshake are taking it one step further.\n\nYou can connect with local schools and educational organizations, you can\nengage with the \"shadowee\" and screen applications through video resumes, and\nyou can improve performance through the in-platform feedback loop.\n\n### **2\\. A workforce analytics platform like** **Cognisess**\n\n  \nWorkforce analytics can reveal valuable insights into your human resource\npotential, future possibilities, and next-best actions to boost performance.\nAnalytics is now critical for human resource development programs, which is\nwhy solutions like Cognisess have rapidly gained traction.\n\nCognisess Pro is a predictive people analytics platform that has 50+\nassessments to measure 120+ performance attributes. It uses AI to bypass the\nrisk of bias/subjectivity, maximizing the value of your people assets.\n\n### **3\\. A career pathing and internal mobility tool like** **Paddle**\n\n  \nIn a large workforce, hidden employee potential can go unnoticed. Your human\nresource development program should be able to tap into such capabilities to\noptimize resource utilization in your company. A tool like Paddle can match\nemployees with the right role, improving overall productivity.\n\nPaddle is an AI-powered tool for career pathing and internal mobility\nstreamlining. It has a repository of learning materials to support\ntransitions. The tool's AI can analyze employee skill sets and career\nhistories to recommend the most suitable career path.\n\n### **4\\. A multi-device e-learning authoring solution like** **Gomo**\n\n  \nYour e-learning platform must combine multi-device delivery for convenient,\npersonalized learning experiences with advanced analytics on employee\nprogress. Gomo has two modules: Authoring for e-learning content generation\nand Delivery & Analytics to track consumption on multiple devices.\n\nGomo is a no-installation SaaS product that's easy to use, reducing the time-\nto-value from your human resource development program. It is used by the likes\nof Vodafone, Sony, and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n## **Looking Forward: Which Areas of Human Resource Development Demand\nAttention in 2020?**\n\nThe definition of human resource development concept covers a broad spectrum.\n\nWith so many areas and functions to address, it can be challenging to\nprioritize those that demand the most attention. Fortunately, predictive\nanalytics tools can highlight which organization-specific areas of human\nresource development should rank the highest on your checklist for every\nquarter/year.\n\nApart from this, it is a good idea to keep an eye on the latest HR trends and\nmap your HRD program to global benchmarks to gain a competitive advantage.\n\nFor 2020, we recommend a keen focus on the following areas:\n\n  * **Shedding legacy practices:** Three out of five HR leaders fear irrelevance in 2020 if the HR function doesn't embrace modernization, as per KPMG's [survey](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/11/the-future-of-human-resources-2020.html) of 1,300 HR leaders.\n  * **Establishing a culture framework:** 61% of respondents in the survey we cited are in the process of changing their culture. In 2020, HR professionals will need an established framework to align culture to continuous training and development.\n  * **Preparing for artificial intelligence (AI):** Targeted human resource training and development to mitigate the challenges brought on by AI is vital in 2020. 56% of respondents in the KPMG survey agree on this issue.\n\n  \nRemember, a human resource development program isn't set in stone. In essence,\nfeedback from execution managers, realigning the program based on performance\nand learning analytics, and finally, incorporating global trends in HR will be\nthe way forward in the execution of a successful HRD program.\n\nAre you ready to design a human resource development strategy that's suited to\nyour company?\n\n_What does your human resource development program for 2020 look like?

Taylor Jr., a human resources expert, is tackling your questions\nas part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society\nfor Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society._\n\n _The questions are submitted by readers, and Taylor's answers below have been\nedited for length and clarity._\n\n **Have a question?** Do you have an HR or work-related question you\u2019d like me\nto answer? [Submit it\nhere](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/01/18/hr-ask-our-\nexpert/1040330001/).\n\n **Question: After five years at my company, I was recently promoted to a\nmanagerial position, so I\u2019ll have direct reports for the first time in my\nlife. What advice do you have for a new manager?**\n\n _Johnny C. Taylor Jr.:_ I\u2019m happy to hear your hard work paid off.\nCongratulations!\n\nBefore Day One, do your homework. Does your organization offer management\ntraining or courses? Or, does HR have access to external resources? I highly\nrecommend checking. Becoming a manager (especially one responsible for other\npeople) is a big change and these could help you acclimate more quickly.\n\nI remember years ago thinking becoming a manager was all about having a nicer\ntitle, more flexibility, and a higher salary. And then I got my first\npromotion and realized just how much I earned that extra money and that fancy\ntitle. People management is HARD.\n\nExcelling in your role as a people manager demands new skills and a different\nmindset than you had while executing as an individual contributor. As a people\nmanager, your job is to allocate resources \u2013 time, money, and people \u2013 to\ndrive your organization forward. Given that resources are typically finite,\nit\u2019s essential to know how to invest them wisely for the greatest return.\n\nTo do so, you need to know a few things.\n\nFirst, where are you going? In other words, what are your organization\u2019s goals\nand what is your team\u2019s responsibility? Knowing the company\u2019s strategy and key\nperformance indicators will help you prioritize the right projects when it\nfeels like a million other things are happening.\n\nSecond, how are you getting there? What are your resources? Obviously, that\nincludes a budget. But, perhaps more importantly, it means understanding your\nteam \u2013 your human resources. What are their strengths and weaknesses? How do\nthey communicate?\n\nIt cannot be overstated: Building relationships and learning about your\npeople, at the outset, is key. Not only does it build trust and comradery,\nyou\u2019ll begin to see how the skills and styles of your direct reports can be\ncombined to create a better team.\n\nIn addition, it might also be helpful to find a mentor. How? By asking! Look\naround your organization for someone you admire. And don\u2019t worry about\nbothering them. Odds are, they had a mentor early on as well \u2013 and may even\nfind your request flattering.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, though. Some days will be challenging. People will not always\nagree with what you say or do. Things will go sideways. And it\u2019s on your\nshoulders to make tough decisions, go to bat for a teammate, or deliver not-\nso-good news. That said, many days will be incredibly rewarding. It\u2019s now your\nturn to promote employees, deliver bonuses, and bring in new talent.\n\nAbove all, believe in yourself and be resilient. Best of luck in your new\nrole!\n\n **Same-sex sexual harassment:**[My company seems confused: Ask\nHR](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/careers/2020/03/31/ask-hr-addresses-\nsame-sex-sexual-harassment-and-transgender-pronouns/5090409002/)\n\n **A co-worker\u2019s affair:**[Disruptive to our workplace: Ask\nHR](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/2020/03/24/romance-between-\nmanager-and-subordinate-can-cause-problems-work/2870189001/)\n\n **Question: As an HR Manager, how do I handle the sudden appearance of\ncognitive deficits and memory loss in my boss, the CEO? He is a cancer\nsurvivor and takes long-term medicine to prevent a recurrence. Recently, he\u2019s\nforgotten entire meetings that happened just days prior and can\u2019t remember\nsimple tasks he\u2019s done for years. I mentioned it to him recently, but he\nbecame very aggressive. I\u2019ve made the owner aware, but he seems unconcerned.\nI\u2019m concerned the CEO is going to do something that negatively affects the\ncompany financially. How should I approach this?**\n\n _Taylor:_ First, I\u2019d like to commend you for recognizing this may be very\ndifficult for both your CEO and the owner. It\u2019s a sensitive situation that\ncould impact your company, so you\u2019re right to wonder how it might be handled\nbest.\n\nIt was a good initial move to share your concerns with your CEO and then to\nhis boss. Even if it didn\u2019t produce the outcome you wanted, you elevated the\nissue and raised awareness. You\u2019d be surprised how many times this first step\nby you helps produce amazing results over time. At a minimum, everyone in\nmanagement is aware of the potential problem. It could be that your CEO\u2019s\ndecline is a temporary matter that improves over time. Time will tell.\n\nHowever, if the CEO\u2019s behavior continues or worsens, you should connect with\nothers within your organization. You mentioned you\u2019ve noticed these changes,\nso I would confirm your observation with others. In doing so, be careful to\nmaintain the confidentiality of your CEO\u2019s medical history \u2013 simply stick to\nwhat you all can see.\n\nIf you find a consensus of an issue, and you have internal legal counsel, then\nyou should loop them into the situation. If you don\u2019t have counsel, find an\nexecutive or manager who has a solid working relationship with the owner. They\nmay be able to advise you on how to approach him more effectively regarding\nyour CEO.\n\nNow, it could turn out you\u2019re the only one noticing these occurrences. If\nthat\u2019s the case, and you still fear they could harm your company\u2019s operations\nor credibility, you do have another option. As an HR Manager, you can support\nhim as you would any other employee.\n\nIf your CEO continues to slip, meet privately and ask if he\u2019s experiencing any\ndifficulties. In doing so, address the behaviors themselves without\nspeculating or assuming underlying causes. If you feel it\u2019s appropriate, you\ncould offer the benefits and protections of the Americans with Disabilities\nAct, the Family Medical Leave Act, or any applicable state-related disability.\nIn other words, there could be small accommodations that make a big\ndifference.\n\nHopefully, one of these tactics fixes the issue. But, if things worsen and you\nsee real impacts on the company, your last resort will be to meet with the\nowner again. When you do, be sure to bring solid evidence along with witnesses\nthat can attest to your account.\n\nRemember: You all want what\u2019s best for the company. By being compassionate and\ntransparent, you\u2019ll see that and work together better.\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?display=popup&app_id=215046668549694&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fcareers%2F2020%2F04%2F07%2Fsuccess-\nnew-manager-comes-training-and-new-mindset-ask-\nhr%2F2951938001%2F)[](http://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fcareers%2F2020%2F04%2F07%2Fsuccess-\nnew-manager-comes-training-and-new-mindset-ask-\nhr%2F2951938001%2F&text=I%20got%20promoted%20to%C2%A0a%20managerial%20position%3A%C2%A0Any%20advice%3F%20Ask%20HR&via=usatoday)[](mailto:?subject=I%20got%20promoted%20to%C2%A0a%20managerial%20position%3A%C2%A0Any%20advice%3F%20Ask%20HR%20-%20from%20USA%20TODAY&body=I%20got%20promoted%20to%C2%A0a%20managerial%20position%3A%C2%A0Any%20advice%3F%20Ask%20HR%0A%0AJohnny%20C.%20Taylor%20Jr.%20offers%20tips%20for%20success%20to%20a%20new%20manager%20and%20advice%20on%20dealing%20with%20a%20CEO%20who%20seems%20to%20have%20memory%20loss.%20Ask%20HR%0A%0ACheck%20out%20this%20story%20on%20USATODAY.com%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fcareers%2F2020%2F04%2F07%2Fsuccess-\nnew-manager-comes-training-and-new-mindset-ask-hr%2F2951938001%2F)\n\n[](/money/)\n\n[](/money/)\n\n[About

outbreak, business organizations are\naccelerating the digital transformation to support remote working**_\n\nOver 160 local and overseas Human Resource Technology (HRTech) service\nproviders, including local startups, are intensely competing to leverage the\nincreased adoption of Digital HR systems by enterprises of all sizes in\nSingapore. These new-age HRTech tools are now helping enterprises hire, train,\nengage and retain employees better, with a strong focus on increasing\n\u201cemployee experience\u201d and \u201corganizational productivity\u201d.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834c096babe.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n**HR News:**[VCV Launches AI-Powered Platform to Simplify the Hiring\nProcess](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/recruitment-onboarding/vcv-\nlaunches-aipowered-platform-to-simplify-hiring-process/)\n\nSingapore has traditionally been seen as a laggard in HRTech adoption, but the\nscenario has been fast-changing over the last two years. This demand for HR\ntechnologies has been further accelerated in recent times due to the COVID-19\noutbreak, as Singapore enterprises are looking to digitalize their HR\nfunctions to support remote working.\n\nThe details of all these providers have been published in the recently\nreleased 2020 Singapore HRTech Market Map, a comprehensive and collaborative\nresearch product of Adrian Tan, renowned HRTech blogger, and [hr\ntech.sg](https://www.hrtech.sg/), a Singapore-based boutique HRTech advisory,\nand analyst firm. Incidentally, Both Adrian Tan and hr tech.sg had worked\ntogether on the [2019 Market Map](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/digital-\ntransformation/2019-singapore-hrtech-market-map-unveiled-a-\nrecord-160-specialised-local-and-overseas-hrtech-providers-servicing-the-\nsingapore-talent-marketplace/) also, which was widely acclaimed for his\ncomprehensive coverage of the categories and players.\n\nA step further, the 2020 Singapore HR Tech Market Map has seen the addition of\nnewer HR categories and subcategories to help HR Professionals and Enterprises\nchoose the vendors in line with their specific needs.\n\nThe 2020 market map has been categorized the service providers across EIGHT\nmajor Talent segments: Talent Acquisition (Applicant Tracking System;\nSourcing\u00beJob Boards, Referrals, Tech Hiring, Non-PMET; Screening\u00beAssessments,\nVideo Interviews, Background Check), Talent Engagement (Employee\nCommunication; Onboarding; Performance Management), Talent Development\n(Coaching & Mentoring; Competency Management), Talent Operations **** (HR\nAutomation & Bots; Payroll), Talent Rewards (Benefits, Wellness, Compensation\nManagement), Talent Analytics, Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS\nEnterprise and SMB\u2019s) and Talent Planning.\n\n\u201cThe need of the hour for HR functions is to aggressively adopt HRTech. This\nwill not only help the HR teams to solve pressing business challenges and use\nbudgets more efficiently, but it also improves candidate and employee\nexperience too. And notably, it frees up bandwidth for HR teams to focus on\nmore strategic initiatives\u201d, says Adrian Tan.\n\n\u201cEnterprises that focus on HRTech as part of their transformational agenda are\ncreating sustainable economic value and better workplace experience for their\nemployees. Singapore enterprises should now leverage the Resilience Budget\nprovisions unveiled in the Parliament recently by Singapore\u2019s Deputy Prime\nMinister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, and other government programs\nsuch as IMDA\u2019s Singapore Digital (SG:D) initiative to digitalize their HR\nfunction\u201d, adds Sriram Iyer, CEO, hr tech.sg.\n\nOrganizations around the world are widely adopting systems from enterprise\nsoftware providers as well as specialized HR tech vendors, depending on their\nspecific workplace requirements.\n\n**HR News:**[The Era of Passwords at Work Ends With the Release of Okta\nFastpass](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/hr-tech-news/the-era-of-\npasswords-at-work-ends-with-the-release-of-okta-fastpass/)\n\n![2020 Singapore HR Tech Market Map](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=HR+Technology+Service+Providers+Aim+at+Digital+Transformation\n\"Share this News on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=HR+Technology+Service+Providers+Aim+at+Digital+Transformation&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this News on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this News on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this News on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-email-\nicon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=HR Technology Service Providers Aim at Digital\nTransformation&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this News via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Digital Transformation ](/category/digital-\ntransformation/ \"Digital Transformation\")\n\n  * [ ![Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/shutterstock_1134410339_5db306fad1860.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-special-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-\nspecial-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe future of work is uncertain, and the fear of AI taking over work is real.\nBut there\u2019s more to it, as expressed by some HR leaders we spoke to.\n\nby [Puja Lalwani](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/puja-\nlalwani-1/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Oct 25, 2019\n\n  * [ ![How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process \\(and How It Won\u2019t\\)](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/ai_in_recruitment_5da994c5c9d8b.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-and-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-wont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process (and How It Won\u2019t)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-\nand-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-\nwont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nWe hear a lot about AI\u2019s effect on jobs, but what about its effect on\nrecruiters?

Fortunately, there are specific, research-based steps that\nmanagers can take without great effort to improve the engagement and\nproductivity of remote employees, even when there is little time to prepare.\nFirst, it's important to understand the common challenges, from isolation to\ndistractions to lack of face-to-face supervision. Then managers can support\nremote workers with 1) regular, structured check-ins; 2) multiple\ncommunication options (and established norms for each; 3) opportunities for\nsocial interactions; and 4) ongoing encouragement and emotional support.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/03/Mar20_18_1198947805.jpg) Ada\nYakota/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/03/a-guide-to-managing-your-newly-remote-\nworkers?language=es)\n\nWe\u2019ve made our [coronavirus coverage](/insight-\ncenter/coronavirus?ab=articlewidget-insightcenter-coronavirus) free for all\nreaders.

While [close to a\nquarter of the U.S. workforce already works from\nhome](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t06.htm) at least part of the\ntime, the new policies leave many employees \u2014 and their managers \u2014 working out\nof the office and separated from each other for the first time.\n\nAlthough it is always preferable to establish clear remote-work policies and\ntraining in advance, in times of crisis or other rapidly changing\ncircumstances, this level of preparation may not be feasible. Fortunately,\nthere are specific, [research-based steps that managers can\ntake](https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amp.2014.0120) without great\neffort to improve the engagement and productivity of remote employees, even\nwhen there is little time to prepare.\n\n### **Common Challenges of Remote Work**\n\nTo start, managers need to understand factors that can make remote work\nespecially demanding. Otherwise high-performing employees may experience\ndeclines in job performance and engagement when they begin working remotely,\nespecially in the absence of preparation and training. Challenges inherent in\nremote work include:\n\n**Lack of face-to-face supervision:** Both managers and their employees often\nexpress concerns about the lack of face-to-face interaction. Supervisors worry\nthat employees will not work as hard or as efficiently (though\n[research](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/19-054_2ecb5287-d0bd-4aa0-b3d8-36fb44b757b4.pdf)\nindicates otherwise, at least for some types of jobs). Many employees, on the\nother hand, struggle with reduced access to managerial support and\ncommunication. In some cases, employees [feel that remote managers are out of\ntouch with their\nneeds](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/job.369), and thereby\nare neither supportive nor helpful in getting their work done.\n\n**Lack of access to information:** Newly remote workers are often surprised by\nthe added time and effort needed to locate information from coworkers. Even\ngetting answers to what seem like simple questions can feel like a large\nobstacle to a worker based at home.\n\nThis phenomenon extends beyond task-related work to [interpersonal\nchallenges](/2015/11/resolve-a-fight-with-a-remote-colleague) that can emerge\namong remote coworkers.\n[Research](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.12.3.346.10098)\nhas found that a lack of \u201cmutual knowledge\u201d among remote workers translates to\na lower willingness to give coworkers the benefit of the doubt in difficult\nsituations. For example, if you know that your officemate is having a rough\nday, you will view a brusque email from them as a natural product of their\nstress. However, if you receive this email from a remote coworker, with no\nunderstanding of their current circumstances, you are more likely to take\noffense, or at a minimum to think poorly of your coworker\u2019s professionalism.\n\n**Social isolation:**  [Loneliness](/2018/11/helping-remote-workers-avoid-\nloneliness-and-burnout) is one of the most common complaints about remote\nwork, with employees missing the informal social interaction of an office\nsetting. It is thought that extraverts [may suffer from isolation\nmore](https://www.aabri.com/manuscripts/162492.pdf) in the short run,\nparticularly if they [do not have opportunities to connect](http://www.na-\nbusinesspress.com/JMPP/ClarkLA_Web13_3_.pdf) with others in their remote-work\nenvironment. However, over a longer period of time, isolation can [cause any\nemployee to feel less\n\u201cbelonging\u201d](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1110.0661) to\ntheir organization, and can even result in [increased intention to\nleave](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2008-16251-016.html) the company.\n\n**Distractions at home:**  We often see photos representing remote work which\nportray a parent holding a child and typing on a laptop, often sitting on a\nsofa or living-room floor. In fact, this is a terrible representation of\neffective virtual work. Typically, we encourage employers to ensure that their\nremote workers have both dedicated workspace and adequate childcare before\nallowing them to work remotely. Yet, in the case of a sudden transition to\nvirtual work, there is a much greater chance that employees will be contending\nwith suboptimal workspaces and (in the case of [school and daycare\nclosures](/2020/03/how-working-parents-can-prepare-for-coronavirus-closures))\nunexpected parenting responsibilities. Even in normal circumstances family and\nhome demands [can impinge on remote\nwork](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879105000898);\nmanagers should expect these distractions to be greater during this unplanned\nwork-from-home transition.\n\n### **How Managers Can Support Remote Employees**\n\nAs much as remote work can be fraught with challenges, there are also\nrelatively quick and inexpensive things that managers can do to ease the\ntransition. Actions that you can take today include:\n\n**Establish structured daily check-ins:  **Many successful remote managers\nestablish a daily call with their remote employees.  This could take the form\nof a series of one-on-one calls, if your employees work more independently\nfrom each other, or a team call, if their work is highly collaborative. The\nimportant feature is that the calls are regular and predictable, and that they\nare a forum in which employees know that they can consult with you, and that\ntheir concerns and questions will be heard.\n\n**Provide several different communication technology options:  **Email alone\nis insufficient. Remote workers benefit from having a \u201cricher\u201d technology,\nsuch as video conferencing, that gives participants many of the visual cues\nthat they would have if they were face-to-face. Video conferencing has many\nadvantages, especially for smaller groups: Visual cues allow for increased\n\u201cmutual knowledge\u201d about coworkers and also help reduce the sense of isolation\namong teams. Video is also particularly useful for complex or sensitive\nconversations, as it feels more personal than written or audio-only\ncommunication.\n\nThere are other circumstances when quick collaboration is more important than\nvisual detail. For these situations, provide mobile-enabled individual\nmessaging functionality (like Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc.) which can be\nused for simpler, less formal conversations, as well as time-sensitive\ncommunication.\n\n#### Further Reading\n\n  * ![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/03/coronavirus_cover.png)\n\n###### [Coronavirus + Business: The Insights You Need from\nHBR](https://store.hbr.org/product/coronavirus-and-business-the-insights-you-\nneed-from-harvard-business-review/10440?sku=10440E-KND-ENG?referral=02560)\n\nLeadership & Managing People FREE EBOOK\n\nAdd to Cart\n\n    * __Save\n    * __Share\n\nIf your company doesn\u2019t have technology tools already in place, there are\ninexpensive ways to obtain simple versions of these tools for your team, as a\nshort-term fix.  Consult with your organization\u2019s IT department to ensure\nthere is an appropriate level of [data security](/2020/03/will-coronavirus-\nlead-to-more-cyber-attacks) before using any of these tools.\n\n**And then establish \u201crules of engagement\u201d:  **Remote work becomes more\nefficient and satisfying when managers set expectations for the frequency,\nmeans, and ideal timing of communication for their teams. For example, \u201cWe use\nvideoconferencing for daily check-in meetings, but we use IM when something is\nurgent.\u201d Also, if you can, let your employees know the best way and time to\nreach you during the workday (e.g., \u201cI tend to be more available late in the\nday for ad hoc phone or video conversations, but if there\u2019s an emergency\nearlier in the day, send me a text.\u201d) Finally, keep an eye on communication\namong team members (to the extent appropriate), to ensure that they are\nsharing information as needed.\n\nWe recommend that managers establish these \u201crules of engagement\u201d with\nemployees as soon as possible, ideally during the first online check-in\nmeeting. While some choices about specific expectations may be better than\nothers, the most important factor is that all employees share the same set of\nexpectations for communication.\n\n**Provide opportunities for remote social interaction:  **One of the most\nessential steps a manager can take is to structure ways for employees to\ninteract socially (that is, have informal conversations about non-work topics)\nwhile working remotely. This is true for all remote workers, but particularly\nso for workers who have been abruptly transitioned out of the office.\n\nThe easiest way to establish some basic social interaction is to leave some\ntime at the beginning of team calls just for non-work items (e.g., \u201cWe\u2019re\ngoing to spend the first few minutes just catching up with each other. How was\nyour weekend?\u201d). Other options include virtual pizza parties (in which pizza\nis delivered to all team members at the time of a videoconference), or virtual\noffice parties (in which party \u201ccare packages\u201d can be sent in advance to be\nopened and enjoyed simultaneously). While these types of events may sound\nartificial or forced, experienced managers of remote workers (and the workers\nthemselves) report that virtual events help reduce feelings of isolation,\npromoting a sense of belonging.\n\n**Offer encouragement and emotional support:  **Especially in the context of\nan abrupt shift to remote work, it is important for managers to acknowledge\nstress, [listen to employees\u2019 anxieties and concerns](/2020/03/how-to-\nreassure-your-team-when-the-news-is-scary), and empathize with their\nstruggles. If a newly remote employee is clearly struggling but not\ncommunicating stress or anxiety, ask them how they\u2019re doing. Even a general\nquestion such as \u201cHow is this remote work situation working out for you so\nfar?\u201d can elicit important information that you might not otherwise hear. Once\nyou ask the question, be sure to listen carefully to the response, and briefly\nrestate it back to the employee, to ensure that you understood correctly. Let\nthe employee\u2019s stress or concerns (rather than your own) be the focus of this\nconversation.\n\n[Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/3094912) on emotional\nintelligence and [emotional contagion](/2020/03/anxiety-is-contagious-heres-\nhow-to-contain-it) tells us that [employees look to their managers for\ncues](/2001/12/primal-leadership-the-hidden-driver-of-great-performance) about\nhow to react to sudden changes or crisis situations. If a manager communicates\nstress and helplessness, this will have what Daniel Goleman calls a [\u201ctrickle-\ndown\u201d effect](/2004/01/what-makes-a-leader) on employees. Effective leaders\ntake a two-pronged approach, both acknowledging the stress and anxiety that\nemployees may be feeling in difficult circumstances, but also providing\naffirmation of their confidence in their teams, using phrases such as \u201cwe\u2019ve\ngot this,\u201d or \u201cthis is tough, but I know we can handle it,\u201d or \u201clet\u2019s look for\nways to use our strengths during this time.\u201d With this support, employees are\nmore likely to take up the challenge with a sense of purpose and focus.\n\nWe\u2019ll add our own note of encouragement to managers facing remote work for the\nfirst time: you\u2019ve got this.

In many developed\ncountries, productivity is stagnating. But the answer to one could be the\nanswer to the other as long as we think about engagement in the right way and\nwith the right tech, writes Stuart Hearn, CEO of Clear Review._**\n\nThe UK isn\u2019t alone in having a productivity problem. A brief look at the\nBureau of Labor Statistics shows that the US has its challenges, too,\n[particularly in some sectors](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/prin.nr0.htm).\nBut the UK is racing to find a new place in world trade before its regulatory\nexit from the European Union at the end of 2020. The stakes are high, and the\nrhetoric is persuasive. Only a couple of years ago, the Bank of England\u2019s\nchief economist Andy Haldane was widely quoted as saying that the average\nFrench worker accomplishes by Thursday lunchtime what it takes a British\nworker all week to do. It was a dramatic - perhaps even hyperbolic -\npronouncement, but it raised an important issue.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834cadce393.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nWhy are so many developed economies struggling with\n[productivity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/how-employee-engagement-leads-to-a-more-productive-workforce/)? We\nwork fewer hours now, on average, but gradually decreasing hours is a global\ntrend. The key may lie in a value that has remained consistent (and\nconsistently stagnant) for years: employee engagement. The UK has one of the\nlowest rankings for employee engagement in the world: just 11% of employees\nclaim to be highly engaged at work. Engagement, in truth, is an issue\nthroughout western Europe and Asia. Even the US and Canada, who typically come\nat or near the top of engagement measures, report that only around 30% of\nemployees are highly engaged. In the most engaged countries in the world, 70%\nof employees are actively disengaged from (or indifferent to) their jobs.\n\nWhy is this important? Because analysts from Gallup to Gartner draw a clear\nline between engagement, productivity, and profitability. Organizations with\nhighly engaged employees make more money, have happier customers, and deliver\nmore profit. A [Gallup\nreport](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/162953/tackle-employees-\nstagnating-engagement.aspx) from 2013 estimated that disengaged US employees\ncost the economy between $450 billion and $550 billion a year in lost\n[productivity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/10-ways-\nhr-managers-can-boost-workplace-productivity/). Should we just accept that\nthese numbers are difficult to move? Should we continue to apply the patchwork\nquilt of solutions that have served us so poorly in the past: more remote\nworking, more wellbeing initiatives, a friendlier working environment? All of\nthese things are good in and of themselves, but do they move the needle?\n\n## **A Tested Measure of Work Engagement**\n\nMost references to employee engagement start and end with the annual\nengagement survey. Whether they\u2019re a brief dozen questions or an indigestible\nbarium meal of 50 or more, they tend to suffer from the same problem: action.\nIn a recent _Forbes_ poll, 58% of HR directors admitted that they took no\nmeaningful response from engagement data. And this has a vital bearing on our\nproductivity issue. In a meta-analysis of 90 engagement studies by Wilmar\nSchaufeli at the University of Utrecht, **work engagement** has proved to be a\nmore reliable predictor of both task and team performance than any other\nsingle factor. It\u2019s more important than loyalty. It\u2019s more important, even\nthan inspirational leadership.\n\nSchaufeli and his colleagues are the creators of the Utrecht Work Engagement\nScale - the most widely used and tested model for work engagement. Their\nthinking is to measure engagement in a way that refers directly to the\nperson\u2019s work. This is crucial. eNPS, for example, measures loyalty. Loyalty\nis important, but it doesn\u2019t have as secure a connection with performance.\nWhy? Because our experience of our working lives is grounded in the work we\ndo, not the trappings of being at work. If you want to make someone more\nengaged, you need to make their actual work better, not book them a massage,\nor buy a bean-to-cup coffee machine.\n\n## **How Engagement Can Influence Performance**\n\nAstute readers will have spotted a missing piece here. If genuine engagement\ncan only be found in the experience of doing work, the insights from\nengagement surveys need to be tied back into work outcomes. This is where\nengagement needs to work in concert with performance management. Historically,\nthese disciplines have been measured separately. There are anonymity issues to\novercome - engagement surveys can only really guarantee candor by offering\nanonymity - which makes it challenging to feed specific results back into the\nsystem and create key actions for individuals.\n\nThe solution is to reflect an employee\u2019s answers at them in real-time. Ask the\nemployee the right questions with the right cadence, then use those answers to\ngive the employee a springboard for a discussion with their manager. This has\ntwo key advantages. Firstly, it guarantees anonymity at an individual level;\nand secondly, it places the responsibility for engagement where it belongs -\nwithin the [employee-manager\nrelationship](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/ai-in-hr/how-ai-is-\nimproving-the-employee-manager-relationship/). HR should not be held\nresponsible for the engagement of the team. Their role should be to gather the\ninsight at a macro-level for discussion with senior leaders and managers. The\nactual process of boosting engagement - the details of resources,\nrelationships, and means that employees need to do their jobs better - sits\nwithin the team.\n\n**Learn More:[The Future of Employee Engagement: Supporting the Whole\nWorker](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/the-\nfuture-of-employee-engagement/)**\n\n## **A Continuous Approach to Engagement**\n\nThere is a final piece to the puzzle. The frequency with which you measure\npeople\u2019s engagement is crucial. Just like proper performance management,\nengagement needs to be done continuously.\n\nTo take an example: if your engagement surveys are conducted annually, you\nrisk your results being skewed by the challenges of everyday life. You don\u2019t\nwant your engagement results to be affected by a sick child or a terrible\nmorning commute. But you very much do want to understand problems in a timely\nway, so you have the chance to take action. One of the main reasons\norganizations are dispensing with annual appraisals is because performance\nmanagement needs to be grounded in what\u2019s happening _now_ , not what happened\nnine months ago. If you take a regular view of engagement by measuring it\nevery month rather than every year, you can feed those results into a\nperformance conversation before an issue has a chance to fester.\n\nYou can\u2019t inflict a hundred-question survey on your people every month, so\nthis approach has implications for the format of the study itself. Once again,\nthe principles of proper performance management apply here. Just as a check-in\nconversation slims down the appraisal format - breaking an hour- or days-long\nprocess into bite-size chunks that happen throughout the year - so it\u2019s\nentirely possible to create a lighter, more straightforward engagement check\nthat doesn\u2019t pull people out of the flow of work.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Increase Employee Engagement through Modern\nITSM](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-to-\nincrease-employee-engagement-through-modern-itsm/)**\n\n## **The Path to High Performance**\n\nThe aim of all this is to create a meaningful dialogue between manager and\nemployee. It\u2019s a facet of [performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/impacts-on-employee-engagement-with-performance-management/). We\nneed to help employees to be more aware of their energy, their motivations,\nand their sense of purpose so that this information can fuel their\ndevelopment. Yes, someone can be upset for a few days because their car was\nstolen. But that shouldn\u2019t affect their work engagement. What does affect\ntheir work engagement is a complicated professional relationship, or\npersistently buggy software or an outdated process. And these are things we\ncan fix. These are the things\n[managers](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/leadership-\nsuccession/managers-do-things-right-leaders-do-the-right-thing/) can move the\nneedle on. We can resolve those challenges or find those opportunities to\n[upskill](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/skills-of-the-future-10-skills-youll-need-to-thrive-in-2020/). If we can\ncreate that virtuous circle - and the technology already exists to capture\nthis information and automate the prompts we need to take action - then we\u2019ll\nbegin to see those engagement numbers change. And the bottom line will change\nalong with them.\n\n_**Are you following any best practices to improve employee productivity?

The top HR priorities for the next\ndecade will be to build critical skills, strengthen the leadership bench, and\nimplement organizational design and change management.\n\nWhile CHROs seem to be aware of these [pressing\nchallenges](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/articles/chro-pulse-survey-2019\n\"Research Link\"), research suggests that not many are [entirely confident of\ntackling them head-on](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/pl/pdf/2019/05/pl-\nRaport-KPMG-The-future-of-HR-2019-In-the-Know-or-in-the-No.pdf \"Research\nLink\"). One reason behind this uncertainty is that digital transformation has\nnot just forced organizations to redesign their business models and processes,\nbut also their management practices. The use of next-gen technology in HR has\ndisrupted the [already-evolving\nfunction](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-\ntrends/2017/digital-transformation-in-hr.html \"Research Link\"), giving rise to\nnew challenges and opportunities. To understand these shifts, it would help to\nretrace the role of HR and contextualize the change taking place in the last\ndecade. Here\u2019s a look at how new-age technology and tools have helped\ntransform the core functions of HR:\n\n### The shift to a purpose-based HR\n\nFor the longest time, the core function of HR tools and systems has been to\nmaintain a system of record. HR\u2019s role was only a transactional necessity\nbetween the employee and the employer.\n\nThe proliferation of next-gen tech in HR is helping organizations keep track\nof people\u2019s work, undertake objective performance assessment, measure\nengagement, and support employees in making their work-life easier. This shift\nfrom a process-based to a purpose-based HR has paved the way for organizations\nto manage their employees as people and not just resources.\n\n### Meeting the changing workforce expectations\n\nThe next discernible change in HR has been the realization of how vital it is\nto address people's challenges in a timely fashion. Whether its challenges\npertaining to working remotely or digitizing functional HR activities like\nrecruitment, engagement, and assessment \u2013 all of which have been strengthened\nby the inclusion of employee data, advanced tools and devices have helped\norganizations capture and analyze an employee data. Thus, quarterly, or\nyearly, appraisals have given way to continuous feedback, continuous learning\nand continuous rewards.\n\n### Increased focus on experience\n\nThe transition from process-based to purpose-based HR has been enabled by\nsystems and technologies that are designed around \u2018experiences.\u2019 This has\nresulted in HR systems and tools to become more intuitive, user-friendly, and\nadaptive. One of the biggest consequences of this has been the inclusion of\nmulti-disciplinary experts in the HR function, which, up until a decade ago,\nwould have been difficult to imagine. Today, leading organizations are hiring\nexperts in analytics, artificial intelligence, user interface/experience, and\ndesign thinking to improve workplace experience.\n\nTechnologies like robotics process automation, machine learning, natural\nlanguage processing are being leveraged to develop simple, and seamless HR\nsystems. Similarly, the increasing use of digital tools to measure health and\nwellness has also helped collaborate with mental health experts, fitness\ncoaches, and dieticians. This has made it possible for experts with diverse\nknowledge to build cohesive HR solutions that ensure maximum optimization and\nefficiency.\n\nHR leaders and professionals must work towards aligning the entire HR function\nto ensure that employees can perform to their potential. They need to leverage\nnew technologies to empower and engage employees with systems that can deliver\na smooth workplace experience for a diverse workforce. Finally, they need to\nembrace the fact that being digital does not mean randomly using new\ntechnology and tools, but systematically using them to optimize existing human\ncapital management practices. These changes will not only make the HR function\nmore effective but also redefine its business scope in the organization. While\nthe process involves several experts and stakeholders, HR leaders must lead\nthe process of building systems that are truly adaptive, enhance productivity,\nand are designed for every employee in the organization.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Talent Management](/category/compensation-performance/talent-\nmanagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=talent-management \"Browse more\nin: Talent Management\"), [HR Technology](/category/hr-technology/hr-\ntechnology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hr-technology \"Browse more in:\nHR Technology\"), [#Design Thinking HR](/tag/design-thinking-\nhr?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=design-thinking-hr \"Browse more in:\nDesign Thinking HR\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Manav Seth](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1452578431/authors/manav-\nseth.jpg)](/author/manav-seth)\n\n#### [Manav Seth](/author/manav-seth)\n\nManav Seth is a freelance writer at People Matters.\n\n[NEXT STORY: The role of UI and UX in boosting employee experience\n](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/employee-engagement/the-role-of-ui-and-\nux-in-boosting-employee-experience-24802?page=2 \"Article: The role of UI and\nUX in boosting employee experience &ndash;

Emond](//www.gallup.com/people/item.aspx?a=148145) and Ellyn Maese\n\n![COVID-19 Strategies and Policies of the World's Largest\nCompanies](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/rfpjezg9o0kd1bqawrhuca.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * New teams are critical for developing policies and providing information\n  * Learn COVID-19 protocols and business contingency plans\n  * Monitor impact and conduct assessments to sustain business function\n\n> _Gallup Managing Director Larry Emond_ _gathered the strategies and policies\n> of 100_ _members of the CHRO Roundtable, an organization that includes the\n> CHROs of more than 650 of the world 's largest companies, for their\n> responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. The companies in this sampling average\n> $27 billion in revenue with 80,000 employees and most are global\n> organizations. This is what Emond found._\n\n### **Crisis Management Teams**\n\nMost organizations have created crisis management teams, task forces or\ncommittees with a response tailored to specific geographic regions. These task\nforces meet regularly to develop policies and provide information to leaders,\nmanagers and front-line employees regarding COVID-19 awareness, prevention,\nmanagement and hygiene practices.\n\nThese teams are also focused on management protocols and business continuity\nplans to guide current actions and forecast possible responses to future\nevents. In general, their protocols and plans include:\n\n  * developing succession contingencies for all major executives\n  * conducting business using virtual, video or audio capabilities\n  * restricting travel\n  * reducing to business-critical operations only\n  * moving critical operations to unaffected regions\n  * cross-training team members to perform critical functions in the event of an unexpected absence or quarantine of another team member\n  * documenting business-critical functions, processes or procedures in the event of an unexpected absence or quarantine of a team member\n  * distributing call center scripts and agent communications\n\nIf an employee is diagnosed with COVID-19, many companies have established\nprotocols like these:\n\n  * Require employees to report confirmed cases -- either of self or family member -- of COVID-19 to HR or management. The affected are typically required to stay home for 14 days and/or until cleared by a doctor to return to work with confirmation that there is no diagnosis of COVID-19.\n  * Isolate employees diagnosed at work; immediately disinfect objects they've touched; trace their contact with other employees, customers, and clients; and notify those who may have been exposed without releasing the diagnosed employee's name.\n  * Ask employees to log all contact with other employees or visitors in case they become symptomatic so that others can be informed of potential exposure.\n\n### **Travel Requirements**\n\nMost companies have recommended limiting personal and professional travel, and\nsome have assured workers they could decline professional invitations without\npenalty. Generally called soft bans, these partial travel restrictions have\nbeen issued with requests to inform HR of travel and avoid air travel, public\ntransportation and large gatherings, as well as 14-day self-quarantines\nfollowing travel to affected areas.\n\nHowever, hard bans are in effect in many companies, and travel to China,\nItaly, South Korea, Iran, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan has been prohibited.\nIndeed, most intercontinental travel -- and, more recently, even travel in\ngeneral -- has stopped for the time being, unless it's mission-critical.\n\n### **Business Impact**\n\nLeaders are holding additional meetings to monitor business impact in efforts\nto protect or sustain business functions. Many companies with facilities in\naffected areas have closed them and are canceling their own -- or their\nemployees' presence at -- conferences, events and face-to-face meetings. Some\nhave been able to move operations to unaffected locations.\n\nSimultaneously, CHROs are:\n\n  * monitoring supply chains or providers for potential impacts\n  * conducting ongoing supply chain risk assessment and operation impact assessment\n  * considering alternative suppliers\n  * preparing for shortages, transportation delays or communication delays\n  * approving additional budget for supplies or additional paid time off\n  * reducing or suspending bonuses for top earners\n  * analyzing and forecasting potential market impacts\n\n### **Wellbeing**\n\nCompanies are also assessing risks to their [employees' physical and financial\nwellbeing](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/288722/keep-remote-worker-\nwellbeing-high.aspx). Their mitigation efforts include:\n\n  * instituting mandatory work-from-home or [remote work](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/288956/covid-teams-working-remotely-guide-leaders.aspx) policies where possible\n  * closing on-site facilities such as gyms, cafeterias and common areas\n  * making revisions to employee compensation and benefits policies\n  * granting paid time off for symptomatic employees, employees who must care for family members who are diagnosed with COVID-19, and/or employees with diagnosed cases of COVID-19\n  * using standing sick leave, extended sick leave, vacation time, paid time off or flex-time policies\n  * increasing sick leave or paid time off for all or on a case-by-case basis\n  * utilizing short-term disability, family leave (FMLA) or other existing benefits\n  * recommending available Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)\n  * reminding employees about mental health services for [stress management](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/257501/charge-work-stress-starting-managers.aspx)\n  * using back-up care programs, childcare subsidies or other dependent care benefits\n  * refraining from penalizing time off of any kind\n  * permitting unlimited unpaid time off without penalty\n  * providing travel/international SOS (medical and travel security) services\n  * paying for time spent under quarantine\n  * [offering work-from-home options](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/263510/manage-remote-employees.aspx) or adjusting schedules due to school closures\n  * communicating employer-sponsored insurance and other relevant benefits\n  * advising employees to avoid public transportation\n  * staggering shifts to help employees avoid busy commutes\n  * advising employees to avoid visiting high-traffic events or locations on personal time\n  * reconfiguring meeting rooms, break rooms and other common areas to promote social distancing\n  * expanding the time of meal service to avoid congestion, and asking employees to consider alternate meal times to reduce crowds\n\n### **Technology**\n\nThese companies are testing technological (e.g., remote work) capabilities,\nemergency notification systems and updating employee contact information.\nThey're advising employees to take their laptops or other portable equipment\nhome each night, and they are devoting IT staff to help employees set up\nremote connections at home, sometimes on employees' personal computers.\n\nLeaders are holding additional meetings to monitor business impact in efforts\nto protect or sustain business functions.\n\nMany companies have required or are encouraging video or audio-conferencing\nmeetings (e.g., Skype, Zoom, Microsoft Teams) or phone calls in lieu of face-\nto-face meetings. They also recommend conducting collaborative projects by\nvideo or audio-conferencing, Google Docs, emails or other online channels.\n\n### **Communications**\n\nCorporate leadership is communicating frequently -- daily, weekly or as\navailable -- to address their organization's COVID-19 response, advice,\npolicies and protocols. Many are issuing FAQ guides, and many are including\nlinks to authorities and external organizations such as the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC), The World Health Organization (WHO),\nJohns Hopkins University, local governments and outbreak maps.\n\nAlong with expert advice, these messages often include a genuinely personal\nelement, i.e., reminding workers to get information from credible\norganizations, assuring them that none of their fellow employees have tested\npositive for the virus (where applicable) and urging employees not to panic or\nspread rumors. They will also often encourage employees to obtain enough food,\nwater, medicines and other essentials for their families in case of quarantine\nor scarcity.\n\nCorporate leadership is communicating frequently -- daily, weekly or as\navailable -- to address their organization's COVID-19 response, advice,\npolicies and protocols.\n\nCommunications are usually tailored to the recipients -- whether leaders,\nmanagers, employees or clients/customers, respectively -- and methods include:\n\n  * social media for public messages\n  * email, mail, text messages, hotlines and internal systems (i.e., intranet) to propagate pertinent information\n  * signage to reinforce hygiene, screening and other organizational policies\n\nMembers of the CHRO Roundtable are conscious of the effects of their\ncommunication, particularly on customers. To that end, many have:\n\n  * Proscribed responses from managers/leaders if contacted by the media. Many have designated media relations personnel who address all questions from the media.\n  * Asked employees not to violate the privacy of diagnosed employees or clients/customers in social media messages.\n  * Deployed social media and marketing messaging about customer policies and alternative commerce/services.\n\n### **Training**\n\nBusinesses are rapidly expanding training opportunities. Much of it concerns\nmanagers, who are being tasked with assisting in coronavirus containment,\nresponding to employee needs or concerns, and communicating disease-management\npolicies and preventative measures, such as hygiene practices. But CHROs are\nalso creating COVID-19-specific training programs for security professionals,\ncleaning crews, maintenance and groundskeeping staff.\n\nThese protocols and responses, we're told, will be operational as long as is\nneeded -- the end of May is the current long-term projection -- and all are\nsubject to revision. Gallup will continue to report on our findings as the\nsituation evolves.\n\n### **Discover these crucial resources to better prepare your company during\nthis disruption:**\n\n  * [Watch our live webinar \"COVID-19: Managing Your Workforce Through Disruption\"](https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/2227447/9B313EDC59F0101EBD44901C0C8CAB0B?parterref=article&utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_292334&utm_medium=copy) to get everything Gallup knows about disruption and other crises.\n  * Read about how to [manage the loneliness and isolation of remote workers in this article](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/268076/manage-loneliness-isolation-remote-workers.aspx).\n  * Read about \"The Changing Place and Space of Work\" in Gallup's [_State of the American Workplace report_](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-workplace-report-2017.aspx), which includes research on remote work trends and best practices.\n\nLarry Emond is Managing Director of Global Leadership Advisory at Gallup.\n\nEllyn Maese is a Research Associate at Gallup.\n\n_Jennifer Robison contributed to this article._\n\n[\n![](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/SPEEDBUMPS/jfrv8v85vegptqw9if7wcw.png)\nDeep Dive  What Is Employee Engagement, Really?

If business needs see a sudden\nshift during the year, goals set in January can be obsolete by July. And if\ngoals are especially challenging, employees may resort to\n[dishonesty](https://hbr.org/2016/09/when-tough-performance-goals-lead-to-\ncheating) to see them through.\n\nFor a look at how organizations approach goal-setting\u2014and what practices are\ncorrelated with effectiveness\u2014some findings from ATD\u2019s _Performance\nManagement: Driving Organizational and Personal Growth_ research report are\nshared below. The new report, which is based on a survey of 534 talent\ndevelopment professionals, examines organizations\u2019 performance management\nprocesses and offers recommendations for how talent development professionals\ncan improve their performance management approach. The study defines\nperformance management as the process of setting goals and expectations for\nemployees, giving employees feedback on their performance, and addressing\nperformance outcomes (such as rewarding strong performance or addressing poor\nperformance).\n\nThe most common metric used to evaluate employees was performance goals, such\nas completing specific tasks, projects, or outcomes. Nearly all organizations\n(94 percent) used performance goals to evaluate employees.\n\nEmployees\u2019 managers were most likely to have input in setting employees\u2019 goals\n(94 percent), followed by the employee themselves (62 percent). At less than\nhalf of organizations, senior leadership (42 percent) and the HR function (20\npercent) had input in setting employees\u2019 goals. Just 8 percent of\norganizations gave talent development input in setting goals. However, top-\nperforming organizations\u2014those whose respondents reported high levels of\neffectiveness in all areas of the performance management process\u2014were\nsignificantly more likely to give talent development input in setting goals.\n\nAligning employees\u2019 goals to organizational goals was a common practice. At\nmost organizations (59 percent), employees\u2019 goals are aligned with the\norganizational strategy and goals to a high or very high extent. Nearly a\nthird (31 percent) align these goals to a moderate extent, while 9 percent\nalign them to a small extent or not at all. The report found that having high\nlevels of alignment between employee goals and organizational goals was a\npractice significantly linked to top-performing organizations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore aligning goals, however, it\u2019s important to consider whether alignment\nmakes sense for the role in question. \u201cFull connectivity from the top of the\norganizational pyramid to the bottom is very tough to do,\u201d says Wade Larson,\nchief human resources officer at Wagstaff. \u201cI can see it working for managers,\nwho should be aligned to lead their teams to those targets, but it doesn\u2019t\nalways make sense for lower-level employees to have all their goals align with\ncorporate goals.\u201d If employees\u2019 goals do not align well with organizational\ngoals, Larson recommends aligning their goals to departmental goals instead.\n\nWhile performance goals were the most popular method used to evaluate employee\nperformance, they weren\u2019t the only method in use. More than three-quarters of\norganizations (79 percent) evaluated employees based on their demonstration of\nqualities or organizational values (such as teamwork, leadership, or\nlearning). Most of the organizations evaluated employees based on their\nprogress meeting professional development goals (such as gaining new skills,\nknowledge, or credentials) and their progress meeting stretch goals (defined\nas accomplishing tasks beyond an employee\u2019s current knowledge or skills).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Learn More\n\n_Performance Management_ covers various topics, including feedback cultures,\nhow job responsibilities are determined, how frequently managers and employees\nhave performance conversations and performance evaluations, methods for\naddressing performance, performance management training, and barriers to\neffectiveness. The report includes interviews with subject matter experts\nabout how TD professionals can improve their performance management approach.\n\nThe report, sponsored by Schoox, is available for purchase soon, and ATD\nmembers will be able to download the whitepaper for free.\n\nTo learn more about the report, join us for a [free\nwebcast](https://webcasts.td.org/webinar/3458) (for members and nonmembers) on\nApril 14 at 2 p.m. ET.  \n\n[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.astd.org/Publications%20Marketing/Research/Promo%20Cards/Press18-Research-\nReports-2018-HTML%20Promo-\nCard%20Desktop%20-115896-720x320.png)](https://content.td.org/r/38603)\n[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.astd.org/Publications%20Marketing/Research/Promo%20Cards/Press18-Research-\nReports-2018-HTML%20Promo-\nCard%20Mobile-115896-320x432.png)](https://content.td.org/r/38603)\n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [Performance Management](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Performance%20Management)\n  * [Talent Management](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Talent%20Management)\n\n[ ](https://www.td.org/user/about/ShaunaRobinson)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[Shauna Robinson](https://www.td.org/user/about/ShaunaRobinson)\n\nShauna Robinson is a former ATD research analyst.

change often follows a simple three-step process.\n\nBy: [Julie Cook Ramirez](https://hrexecutive.com/author/julie-cook-ramirez/\n\"Posts by Julie Cook Ramirez\") | March 10, 2020 \u2022 4 min

approached like a home renovation: Keep the\nfeatures that make it unique and then renovate for prolonged future value.\nThat\u2019s the premise behind a new report, _Culture Renovation: A Blueprint for\nAction_ , from Seattle-based [Institute for Corporate\nProductivity](http://www.i4cp.com/) (i4cp). With an increasing number of\ncompanies embarking on initiatives to change their corporate culture\u2014and just\n15% declaring their efforts successful\u2014i4cp recognized a need to explore what\nworks and what doesn\u2019t, and whether those who succeeded had followed a\nblueprint or set of action steps.\n\nDetermined to find out, i4cp conducted interviews with senior-ranking business\nexecutives and collected survey data from more than 7,600 business\nprofessionals worldwide. Halfway through the process, CEO Kevin Oakes had an\nepiphany that led him to coin the phrase \u201cculture renovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d been using the more common term \u2018transformation,\u2019 but it dawned on me\nthat nobody ever really transforms their culture,\u201d says Oakes. \u201cThey don\u2019t\ncompletely change what they are doing and become something different, they\nrenovate their culture and keep the values, purpose, vision and mission that\nmade them great to begin with. It\u2019s a pretty simple nuance, but people like it\nbecause it depicts what they are trying to do at their organization.\u201d\n\n**See also:[Is it time for a culture check-up?](https://hrexecutive.com/is-it-\ntime-for-a-culture-check-up/)**\n\nKeeping with the architectural theme\u2014and highlighting success stories from\n[Ford](https://hrexecutive.com/transforming-culture-how-ford-motor-company-is-\noverhauling-employee-experience/), Microsoft, 3M and others\u2014the report lays\nout three steps to architecting a masterwork: plan, build and maintain. In\ntheir zeal to get started on culture changes, Oakes explains, senior\nmanagement often bypasses the all-important planning phase and begins without\ngarnering any insight from the workforce.\n\n\u201cOne of the worst things a senior-management team can do is lock themselves in\na conference room and try to figure out what the culture is today\u2014because\nthey\u2019ll probably get it wrong,\u201d says Oakes. \u201cThey need a listening strategy\nwhere they get down to the ground level and seek to understand what the\nculture is all about. That will help determine what to keep and what path to\ncreate going forward.\u201d\n\nOrganizations also must have a plan in place to measure and monitor progress\nof the initiative before moving on to build, the most well-known phase,\naccording to Oakes. Build is not only about making changes to the culture, he\nexplains; it also includes ferreting out skeptics and establishing a co-\ncreation mindset. i4cp discovered a strong correlation between companies that\ninvest in training at all levels and the organizations\u2019 ability to embrace the\ndesired behaviors.\n\nThe final phase, maintain, is often ignored, leading organizations to easily\nrevert to the way things were before the initiative began, says Oakes.\nMaintenance can be accomplished through a variety of methods, including\ntalent-management practices, onboarding and performance-management strategies.\n\n\u201cWe found a correlation among companies that changed the way they were going\nto measure the performance of people when they set out to change their\nculture,\u201d says Oakes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about one way of measuring people versus\nanother; it was the sheer fact that you\u2019re changing how you are going to\nmeasure people signals the importance of what you are trying to do.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the report found that success or failure of a culture transformation\nis largely dependent on how an organization views change. Whereas many\ncompanies consider change exhausting\u2014and hope things will just stay the\nsame\u2014Oakes says, progressive organizations view change not only as normal and\nexpected, but as an opportunity to enter new markets or expand what they are\ndoing.\n\n**Related:[Eva Sage-Gavin\u201420/20 vision on 2020 corporate\nculture](https://hrexecutive.com/20-20-vision-on-2020-corporate-culture/)**\n\nInstilling that mindset throughout the organization requires C-level support,\nsays Oakes, citing the example of Satya Nadella, CEO of Redmond, Wash.-based\nMicrosoft Corp. Nadella not only championed Microsoft\u2019s culture-renovation\ninitiative, he continues to reinforce the behaviors and values that epitomize\nwhat the multinational technology company is all about, says Oakes. It\u2019s not\njust top-down support that\u2019s necessary for a successful culture renovation,\nhowever. Support and contribution from the workforce, particularly the\n\u201cinfluencers and energizers,\u201d is also critical.\n\n\u201cThese are the people that make everything run inside the organization,\u201d says\nOakes. \u201cThey cut through the red tape, they know where to go, they\u2019ve got the\nanswers.\u201d\n\nEvery organization has such individuals, but they are \u201cburied in the hierarchy\nof the organization\u201d and are often \u201chidden\u201d to the senior team, says Oakes.\nOften, these individuals are introverts, which can make it difficult to ferret\nthem out, but identifying them and garnering their support is imperative for a\nsuccessful culture renovation.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding who these people are is important because you want to make sure\nthey are the first people you get on board with the culture change,\u201d says\nOakes. \u201cIf they\u2019re not on board, they can be very detrimental to what you are\ntrying to do.\u201d\n\n*\n\n_This is the first in a series about the[Institute for Corporate\nProductivity's](http://www.i4cp.com/) recent work around culture.

Unfortunately, the employee training plan\nfor these initial days isn\u2019t always calibrated for optimal performance.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834b324a1a1.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nA [study of 399 respondents ](https://www.talentlms.com/blog/new-employee-\nonboarding-study/)by TalentLMS suggests that companies face several gaps when\nthey consider how to train new employees.\n\n  * Only 39% receive training on company culture.\n  * Soft skills training for new employees shows similar numbers.\n  * 65% said that the **[onboarding experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/)** helped to lessen newcomer anxiety \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cnot at all.\u201d\n\n  \nSo, how do you fine-tune your employee training plan for maximum impact during\nonboarding and in the first few weeks?\n\nCan you leverage **[learning and development\n(L&D;)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\nlearning-and-development-objectives-strategy/)** to equip new employees to\nbring their best foot forward without an exceptionally long teething period?\n\nYes! By pivoting your employee training plan to incorporate a simple 5M\nmethodology, you can shorten their time-to-full-productivity, boost\nengagement, and reduce the risk of **[employee\nattrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-attrition-complete-guide/)**.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **A Career in Learning and Development: 10 Must-Have Skills\nto Make It Big in 2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/skills-for-a-career-in-learning-and-development/)\n\n## **How Do You Train New Employees? The Answer Lies in a \u201c5M Model\u201d**\n\nIf employees get a negative impression of or face major bottlenecks in the\nworkplace in the first few months, it could drive them to leave the\norganization. So early in the employee journey, they are still not rooted in\nthe organizational culture, and this makes the separation easier. To prevent\nthis, companies need a five-step employee training plan that addresses the\nneeds of new employees head-on.\n\n![The five Ms of an effective employee training plan](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig. 1. The five Ms of an effective employee training plan**\n\n###\n\n### **1. _Mitigate_ the steep learning curve**\n\n  \nMost employees joining your company will have a steep learning curve in the\ninitial stages.\n\nThis is especially true for fresh graduates who have joined the workforce for\nthe first time. Even mid-career professionals who are transitioning from a\ndifferent field could face difficulties in acclimatizing themselves to the\nexpectations of their new roles.\n\nThese employees need to feel comfortable and confident so that they can easily\nacquire new skills/knowledge.\n\nThis involves three steps:\n\n**a. Conduct group onboarding:** To alleviate any newcomer anxiety, it\u2019s a\ngood idea to conduct group\n[**onboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) where recruits can connect with\nother employees who are going through a similar experience.\n\nEssential employee training elements, such as compliance, workforce management\nprotocol, and HR policies, can be explained during group onboarding sessions.\n\nYou can then hold short tests, polls, and quizzes to check for knowledge\nretention \u2013 and follow up with interactive emails after one week to overcome\nthe forgetting curve.\n\n**b. Assign an \u201cearly-days\u201d mentor:** Unlike a typical mentorship program, an\nearly-days mentor wouldn\u2019t aim for outcome-focused employee training. Instead,\nthe mentor is a friend to the new employee, ready to solve queries, answer\nquestions, and assist them in their daily job.\n\nKeep in mind the 70:20:10 equation, which suggests that 70% of learning\nhappens through experience, 20% by interacting with one\u2019s immediate community,\nand 10% through formal learning. Assigning a mentor strengthens the impact of\nthat 20% in your employee training plan.\n\n**c. Allocate one week for shadowing:** By introducing employees to complex\nconcepts and theoretical knowledge, companies risk overwhelming the learner\nwhen they have just joined the organization.\n\nA designated week for shadowing allows new employees to observe their\npeers/seniors, ask questions, and gain a real-world understanding of the job.\n\n### **2. _Mobilize_ new employees\u2019 existing strengths **\n\n  \nOnce an employee has crossed the initial learning phase, it\u2019s time to nurture\nthe potential for which they were hired.\n\nAn employee may not immediately fit in with their assigned team or be able to\ncollaborate with their manager. In such situations, focus on employees\u2019\nexisting strengths so that they aren\u2019t demotivated. This is relevant\nspecifically for employees venturing into a new career path or when they have\ntaken on a new role in the organization. Several skills are inherently\ntransferable (soft skills like communication or hard skills like design) and\nshould be showcased at this stage of your employee training plan.\n\nThis involves three steps:\n\n**a. Adopt strength-based coaching:** Coaching is no longer limited to senior\nexecutives. Mobile platforms like Pluma make coaching sessions accessible to\nmiddle managers and frontline employees.\n\nStrength-based coaching highlights what an employee can do best and nurtures\nthis potential. This coaching tactic can also inspire employees more\neffectively than critical feedback, minimizing the risk of demotivation.\n\n**b. Find cross-department synergies:** After employees shadow their own team\nmembers in the first week on the job, allow them to shadow managers in\ndifferent departments and business units in the following weeks. This will\nhelp them understand your company's vision more clearly and help them\nfamiliarize themselves with the various departments, their roles, the bearing\nof these departments on employees' work.\n\nIn some cases, cross-departmental synergies can be leveraged at a later stage\nto address skill gaps through\n[i](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/why-\ninternal-mobility-is-key-to-building-the-workforce-of-the-future/)nternal\nmobility. That's why this step is so essential for your employee training\nplan.\n\n**c. Take a reverse-mentoring approach:** Reverse mentoring occurs when a\nsenior executive is paired with a new/junior employee to encourage a free-\nflowing, non-linear skills exchange.\n\nBy participating in a reverse mentorship, employees can forge new connections\nwith their colleagues (cutting across generational divides), and discover\nunique strengths that could add value to your company.\n\n**3. _Maintain_ a regular learning track**\n\n  \nThe first two steps focus on empowering new employees and helping them obtain\nthe soft skills needed to interact meaningfully with their teams.\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to implement a formal L&D; plan that incorporates self-learning\nand classroom learning sessions in equal measure. Classroom sessions are\nvital, as they add structure to the employee learning journey and help track\ntheir progress in real-time.\n\nFor this, you would benefit from using e-learning platforms with analytics\ncapabilities.\n\nThis step comprises three further steps:\n\n**a. Offer mobile learning opportunities:** In the first few months, an\nemployee will be engaged in interactions with multiple stakeholders to find a\nfirm foothold in the organizational structure.\n\nAs a result, they may not be able to dedicate uninterrupted hours to learning\nand development. You can address this by incorporating mobile learning into\nyour employee training plan. This may prove particularly beneficial for\nmillennials and Gen Z, who are mobile-natives.\n\n**b. Ensure in-the-moment learning is available** : Coming back to the\n70:20:10 formula, 70% of all learning occurs through work experience. This\nmakes in-the-moment learning an integral component of your employee training\nplan, and even more so for employees who are new to your workflows.\n\nCoaching tips embedded in productivity applications, informative alerts, and\ntimely redirection to learning resources can help employees learn as they\nwork.\n\n**c. Leverage real-time learning data:** Employees mustn't veer from their\nlearning tracks, at least in the first few months of joining a company. You\ncan ensure this by monitoring learners' progress in real-time and sharing\nreports with the employee.\n\nThis will aid in self-motivation.\n\n### **4. _Monitor_ progress with controlled tests**\n\n  \nLearning data may not always accurately portray the progress that an employee\nhas achieved. Here\u2019s where controlled tests can make a difference. These tests\nplace the employee in real-world scenarios, urging them to try out their newly\nacquired skills for meaningful output.\n\nDo note that employees must feel like they are in a _safe_ environment when\nactioning these skills without any worries around being reprimanded.\n\nThis involves three steps:\n\n**a. Simulate real-world work scenarios:** Now is the time for organizations\nto incorporate cutting-edge technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and\nvirtual reality (VR) to test employee skills in simulated, safe environments.\nThis way, tests are decoupled from critical outcomes, but the employee still\nhas a chance to experience the impact of hands-on training memorably.\n\nYou can even embed visual cues and coaching tips into the AR/VR experience,\nacknowledging the right use of skills and alerting employees wherever they go\nwrong.\n\n**b. Hold \u201c100% ownership days\u201d:** This extends the ambit of testing a little\nfurther. On 100% ownership days, the recruit is given end-to-end\nresponsibility for a specific task, including customer interactions, decision-\nmaking, and micro-level leadership.\n\nThis component of your employee training plan allows employees to study the\nimpact of work in day-to-day situations. Of course, a manager/supervisor must\nbe present at hand to intervene if necessary.\n\n**c. Recognize learning achievements:** A significant part of monitoring\nprogress is to recognize and appreciate the milestones that an employee has\nsuccessfully crossed. This may range from a simple \u201cthank you\u201d for easing a\nteam member\u2019s workload, to a formal email announcement when the employee\nattains a mandatory certification.\n\nRecognition also allows learners to track their progress over time, motivating\nthem to accelerate their journey on the learning curve.\n\n**5. _Measure_ at increasing intervals**\n\n  \nContinuous review, along with regular fine-tuning, is essential for any\nemployee training plan, and this applies to new employees well. It is\nadvisable to increase the measurement interval on an incremental basis. The\nfirst checkpoint is every week for the first month. Then, measure learning\nprogress every month for the next quarter. Finally, move to a quarterly\nmeasurement cycle.\n\nThis will ease the learning curve we spoke about in step 1 and allow employees\nto gradually blend into your existing workforce and its culture of learning.\n\nThis step involves three elements:\n\n**a. Check for individual as well as team-wise outcomes:** Individual\nperformance can only go so far. Employees must display key traits like\nteamwork, collaboration, the ability to empathize with colleagues, and\nnecessary foresight.\n\nLearning measurement must factor in team-wise outcomes. We recommend using\npre-onboarding findings as a benchmark and assessing the value the employee\nadds to the team after joining.\n\n**b. Pay equal attention to hard and soft skills:** Too often, an employee\u2019s\nhard skills are highlighted, while their \u201csoft\u201d capabilities (which are\nequally important) pass under the radar. It can be challenging to measure\nprogress in terms of soft skills development. This is where you need peer\nreviews and 360-degree performance feedback.\n\nThe employee\u2019s team members, as well as colleagues from other teams who\ninteracted with them in the _mobilize_ stage, can rate the impact of training\nin terms of soft skills.\n\n**c. Prioritize culture fitment and add for the first year:** One cannot\noverestimate the role of culture fit, and eventually culture add in the\nemployee experience and employees\u2019 overall success in the organization.\n\nYour employee training plan must necessarily include training on the company\u2019s\nculture, from diversity and inclusion to company policies, values, and ethics.\nOnce again, use peer reviews to understand how the culture fit and culture add\nhave improved from week 1 to month 1 to quarter 1, and finally, to year 1.\n\n## **#ProTip: _Maneuver_ the New Employee Learning Experience Using the Right\nTools **\n\nTraining new employees is a multifaceted and dynamic process. No employee\ntraining plan is a set-and-forget initiative, which is why learning analytics\nis so important. Regular tests and data monitoring reveal how employees are\nprogressing across the learning track designed for them to reach their full\nproductivity potential.\n\nBy following the 5M model, companies can address both expressed and latent\nemployee expectations and streamline their learning and development path in\nthe organization.\n\nStrengthen this path further by using targeted learning tools. Here are three\nexamples of such tools:\n\n**1.**[ **SAP Litmos**](https://www.litmos.com/platform/new-employee-training)\n**:** Litmos is the learning management solution (LMS) from the global\nsoftware giant SAP. Litmos has a robust training module, which includes a\ndedicated capability for new employee training management.\n\nYou can leverage Litmos for compliance training \u2013 one of the key elements of\nany onboarding experience \u2013 as well as for knowledge dissemination in\nspecialized business, social, and technical topics. Further, Litmos is easily\nscalable based on your hiring speed and capacity.\n\n**2.**[ **Eloomi**](https://eloomi.com/) **:** Eloomi is an onboarding\nplatform that pays special attention to how you train new employees. The\nplatform has several built-in content programs that can be customized based on\nyour employee training plan.\n\nYou can reuse frequently implemented learning materials in areas such as\nsecurity and compliance. And view progress across all these paths in real-\ntime, with follow-ups via face-to-face meetings. As an additional feature,\nEloomi offers preboarding capabilities for greater candidate/employee\nengagement.\n\n**3.** [**Talmundo**](https://www.talmundo.com/onboarding-software-solution)\n**:** Talmundo\u2019s onboarding software offers an effective solution to train new\nemployees. The employee starts receiving notifications as early as 10 days\nbefore joining the company. These notifications share information on the\ncompany\u2019s overall positioning as well as job-related information.\n\nTalmundo covers the entire new-hire lifecycle \u2013 for example, at the 60-day\nmilestone, it asks onboarding employees about their specific areas of interest\nthat they would like to develop across their tenure.\n\n## **Wrapping Up**\n\nPlatforms like SAP Litmos, Eloomi, and Talmundo can make your employee\ntraining plan productive and successful. Coupled with the 5M model, you can\nhone a new employee\u2019s true potential and enable them to maximize their\nperformance.\n\nThe key is to anticipate initial bottlenecks, institute measures that\nstreamline the learning experience, and blend employee training with the\nworkplace experience. This will lead to sustained outcomes, encouraging\nemployees to continuously grow and scale new frontiers as they progress across\ntheir tenure in the company.\n\n_What does your new employee training plan look like in 2020?

It\ninvolves research to discover who your customers are, what they need, and\nwhere their pain points lie.\n\nCEM means making changes to the way you do things. And it means continually\nlistening to your customers to find out how well you\u2019re doing and what you can\ndo to keep improving.\n\nThere are a few core principles to understand when you\u2019re getting started with\ncustomer experience. The first is that customer service and customer\nexperience are different things.\n\n  * **Customer experience** includes every interaction your customer has with your brand, including those that happen outside of your channels.\n  * **Customer service** is a subset of customer experience. It\u2019s the way you treat customers when they are in direct contact with you, via text, phone, chat or other forms of communication.\n\nThe next is that customer experience is all about journeys. A customer\u2019s\nexperience isn\u2019t bound by internal divisions like sales vs. service or retail\nvs. trade. It is a sum of many parts, and in most cases you can\u2019t predict\nwhere the customer\u2019s journey will begin or where it will lead.  \n  \nAlong that [customer journey](/customer-journey-mapping), any one point of\nfailure (glitchy website, over-long wait for a chat response) can detract\nhugely from the customer\u2019s experience as a whole. It doesn\u2019t matter if the\ncustomer\u2019s delighted by one part of your business if they\u2019re later\ndisappointed by something else.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s wise to optimize every part of the customer journey and create\nan integrated, consistent omnichannel experience that\u2019s based around your\ncustomer rather than the internal anatomy of your business.\n\nResearch from McKinsey found that [customer satisfaction is 73% more\nlikely](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-\ninsights/the-ceo-guide-to-customer-experience) when entire journeys work well\nthan when individual touchpoints do.\n\n## How to measure, optimize, and scale your customer experience capability\n\nCustomer experience management begins with understanding your customers and\ntheir needs. Your [CRM system](https://www.g2.com/categories/crm) is a\nvaluable tool here as it already contains a record of your interactions with\neach customer to date.\n\nYou can also bring in tools like customer surveys and UX research which can\nhelp you dig deeper and understand your customers\u2019 priorities. Do your target\ncustomers care more about certain things than others? Which of the typical\ncustomer journeys for your business hold the most personal importance for\ncustomers? Where are they most likely to want support, reassurance, or a\ngreater range of options?\n\nCustomer-based research, and the resulting customer experience insights, will\nhelp you to prioritize your CX improvements and work more intuitively on\nexisting projects. It could also help point toward efficiencies and\nimprovements you can make for your company\u2019s own sake, especially where\ncustomer insights provide a birds-eye view across your internal silos.  \n  \nIt\u2019s likely that CX improvements will start small within a company and then\ngrow. Small, successful pilot projects will help generate interest in CX and\nmake the case for wider-scale changes and more ambitious programs.\n\n### A company-wide approach\n\nAs we\u2019ve suggested, there are major rewards to be reaped when companies think\nbig. Make your whole business experience-led and the benefits are likely to\nmultiply accordingly. As an experience-first business, you\u2019re in line for\npositive results on big picture measures like your brand loyalty, plus\nimmediate-return results in terms of sales.\n\n**According to**[US research from PwC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/press-\nreleases/2018/experience-is-everything-heres-how-to-get-it-right.html) **:**\n\n  * Consumers will pay up to 16% more for products and services if the experience is great\n  * 1 in 3 will leave a brand they love after just one bad experience\n  * Customers say they\u2019re more likely to try additional services or products when brands provide superior customer experience\n\nMeanwhile, according to [Adobe\u2019s Digital Trends\n2020](https://www.adobe.com/uk/offer/digital-trends-2020.html#): \u201c36% of\ncompanies on the forefront of customer experience said they exceeded their top\nbusiness goal by a significant margin, compared with only 12% of mainstream\ncompanies,\u201d\n\nWhat does that look like in practice? It means that experience isn\u2019t just the\nduty of a single team or department. While it\u2019s important to appoint and\nsupport experience management leaders in your business, they should be setting\ngoals and providing strategies for an entire company\u2019s behavior, not working\nin isolation.\n\n### Changing culture\n\nMaking a commitment to customer-centric ways of doing business is likely to\ninvolve cultural change within your organization. This is likely to be a\nmedium- to long-term endeavor, but there are some changes you can make\nstraight away that will promote CX-friendly ways of working.\n\n### Lead by example\n\nC-suite and leadership have an important role to play in making CX a company\npriority, not only because they\u2019re empowered to make change but because staff\nat all levels naturally look to them to see how to behave. Leaders who walk\nthe talk and put customer experience first can help turn the tide towards\ncustomer-first thinking.\n\n### **Bake CX into your goals and KPIs**\n\nAt team and individual levels you can promote customer-first thinking by\nexplicitly making it a priority in performance management and target-setting.\nNote however that you should prioritize outcomes such as \u201cmake the customer\nfeel heard\u201d rather than behaviors like \u201cchat to every customer\u201d \u2013 authentic\ncustomer connections are more likely to flourish if staff are given some\npersonal input into how they\u2019re achieved.\n\n### **Appoint CX champions**\n\nIt can be helpful to think of CX as a horizontal function, a little like HR or\nIT, vitally connected with every department. Unlike HR or IT though, it can be\nimproved by anyone who is willing and able to step into a customer\u2019s shoes.\nWithin each area of business, try appointing an enthusiastic CX champion who\ncan make suggestions and provide support in making their own part of the\ncompany more customer-centric.\n\n## Setting up a customer experience management system\n\nYour customer management system is a set of tools and processes you can use\ncompany wide to create a continuous cycle of improvement. It\u2019s likely to\ninclude elements you\u2019re already using, with a few new ideas and approaches\nadded to the mix. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to getting it up and running.\n\n### Goals\n\nThe first step is to decide what success will look like. Think about what you\nwant CX to do for your business and what positive results you want to see.\n\n### Strategy\n\nBased on what you\u2019ve discovered about your current levels of customer loyalty\nand customer satisfaction, identify first priorities. Choose one or more\ncustomer journeys to act as your pilot program.\n\n### Tools\n\nCX improvement is largely a matter of awareness and agility, and this is what\nyour tools need to provide. You need to be able to collect customer feedback\ndata at a number of touchpoints across your customer journey(s) and analyze it\nin a way that allows you to take meaningful, rapid action. You also need to be\nable to circulate those insights within your business in a clear, digestible\nformat.\n\n### Process\n\nChoose where in the customer journey you will collect feedback from your end-\nusers and how you will use it. It\u2019s a given that feedback data should be\nanalyzed to reveal your current performance levels, but you may also want to\nfeed it into parts of your business that can make immediate improvements to\nindividual cases. For example, feedback from a dissatisfied customer could be\nrouted directly to the person responsible for the relevant touchpoint.\n\nWhile having a structured customer experience management model is important,\nit\u2019s worth noting that CX is an exploratory process and you will also need to\nallow room for flexibility. You should expect your program to change and grow\nalong with your business and what you learn over time.\n\n### Measure, check and iterate\n\nWhile setting up a CX program, and throughout its duration, measurement is\ncritical. Early in your planning phase, define the metrics that indicate\nsuccess and that you\u2019ll continually measure and track.\n\n**CSat**  and [NPS](/net-promoter-score) are likely candidates for many\nbusinesses, along with [CES](https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-\nmanagement/customer/customer-effort-score/) (Customer Effort Score). You may\nalso want to pull in quantitative measures linked to CX, such as waiting times\non phone and chat channels, customer review scores, and website loading\nspeeds.  \n  \nEven more important than defining your metrics is being able to monitor them\non a continual basis. While it\u2019s true that using multiple metrics will help\nyou get a clearer and more multifaceted picture of how you\u2019re doing, make sure\nyour analytical capacity and your collection capacity are in line with one\nanother. Collecting data is only valuable if you\u2019re able to turn it into\nimprovements and predictions.\n\n### Software that supports your goals\n\nIn order to be useful, cost-effective and scalable, a CX program typically\nrelies on software to store data, route information to the right people and\nanalyze results. Here\u2019s what to look for in CX management software.\n\n#### Accessible everywhere\n\nCloud-based is becoming the gold standard in enterprise software, and with\ngood reason. A cloud-based platform means projects are easy to scale up to\nlarge numbers of users, and that they can access data and analyses on a range\nof devices according to need.\n\n#### User-friendly\n\nBecause CX is a cross-departmental discipline, it\u2019s important that your\nsoftware is as accessible as possible. It should be able to provide on-demand\ndata and insights in a format that anyone can understand.\n\n#### Analytically powerful\n\nIdeally, CX software should be able to not only collect data and analyze it,\nbut use statistical tools to extrapolate and make predictions about the\ndrivers behind positive CX outcomes. It\u2019s a plus if your software can perform\nanalysis on natural language, such as the contents of online reviews and free-\ntext fields in surveys.\n\n#### Integrated\n\nCX touches almost every part of your business, so it\u2019s important to be able to\nconnect your CX software with the platforms you already use, such as CRM and\nHR systems, marketing software, social media analytics, SEO and marketing\ntools.\n\n## Building your dream team\n\nCX is a company wide mission, and your CX team is the beating heart of the\noperation. But how do you bring that team together? To decide who you should\nhire or nurture, you need to know what makes a great CX professional.  \n  \nGiven that CX is a relatively new concept, it\u2019s unsurprising that most CX\nprofessionals have arrived from careers in other areas. HR is a common\nbackground, as is customer service. CX leaders may also cross over from user\nexperience and service design, psychology, marketing or sales.  \n  \nWherever they come from, they\u2019re united by personal qualities like empathy and\nexcellent listening skills. They\u2019re likely to be articulate and persuasive,\ngood at forming professional relationships and making the case for change.  \n  \nAbove all, they are passionate about what they do. They see CX transformation\nas a mission, not just a role, and they\u2019re committed to making the customer\ncentral to everything a business does.\n\n### A long-term view\n\nAs you embark on a CX program, it\u2019s important to set realistic expectations\nabout the timeframe of your work. CX management should be viewed as a long-\nterm program which will deliver long-term results, and it\u2019s likely that these\nwill grow steadily over time rather than offering immediate ROI.\n\nThe time it takes to see results varies by industry. As[ Colin Shaw of Beyond\nPhilosophy notes](https://beyondphilosophy.com/when-will-i-see-results-my-\ncustomer-experience-program/), if your typical customer contact cycle happens\nacross months or years rather than weeks \u2013 (e.g. if you provide infrequent\nservices like optical prescriptions or car servicing) \u2013 it will take longer\nfor customers to encounter and react to the improvements you\u2019ve made.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely that it will take time for your internal CX process to reach\nits full potential in terms of speed and efficiency. Changing minds,\nbehaviors, culture, and protocols is by nature a long-term process, and\nwithout the right tools and plans in place, it will inevitably take longer.\n\nIs it worth the effort? Absolutely. And businesses willing to make the\ninvestment now will find themselves benefiting in the future as great CX\nbecomes more essential and expected.\n\nHistorical data bears this out, too. Across a 10-year span, businesses who\nmaintained above-average customer satisfaction (using ACSI scores) [delivered\na 400% increase in shareholder returns](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-\nfunctions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/putting-customer-experience-at-the-\nheart-of-next-generation-operating-models#0). Those with below-average scores\nachieved little or no growth in their returns.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nCustomer experience touches every part of a business, and it makes significant\ndemands for change and reevaluation within a company. But it offers enormous\npotential too.\n\nCX isn\u2019t just a nice-to-have or an ephemeral buzzword. It\u2019s nothing less than\na more evolved way of doing business, and in an increasingly connected world\nwhere customer expectations have never been higher, it may well be the\ndeciding factor between businesses that fall by the wayside and those that go\non to bigger and better things.\n\n**Make sure your customers have the best experience with your brand that they\npossibly can.

About\nTechnology\\)](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/iei7upoffuyv-\nvzcgqcxua.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * Create the shift you need in HR by focusing on people, not just technology\n  * Start by building HR capabilities into your managers and leaders\n  * Build inspiring leadership with a crucial shift in organizational mindset\n\nHR transformation is often about changing the way HR delivers its services.\nSearch for \"HR transformation\" on the internet, and the majority of results\nwill inevitably lead you to HR _digital_ transformation. Technology is almost\nalways at the center of transforming the way an organization experiences HR\nservices. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, there needs to be a shift\ntoward making people, not technology, the priority.\n\nBut there's a problem. On their path to improving their management approach,\ntoo many leaders and managers outsource the soft skills, people development\nefforts and cultural aspects of their role to HR technology and HR partners.\nExamples include:\n\n>   * **learning and development trainings** that replace managers' role in\n> developing their people\n>   * **upskilling and reskilling initiatives from learning platforms** that\n> replace managers preparing their people for the future\n>   * **selection assessments dictating hiring decisions** that replace\n> talented managers having a say in building their teams' HR business partners\n> -- and that lead to generic feedback sessions instead of great leaders\n> having authentic and open conversations with their teams\n>   * **wellbeing programs** that replace managers and leaders taking a\n> genuine interest in their employees' lives, inside and outside of work\n>\n\nAs long as leaders and managers continue to outsource the soft skills of their\njob to HR technology and HR partners, they will miss the key experiences\nneeded to become engaging executive leaders who know how to build successful\nhigh-development and high-performance cultures.\n\n### Real HR Transformation Is About Transforming HR\n\nHR needs a different kind of transformation.\n\nThe real HR transformation should not be about changing technology -- it\nshould be about changing HR. Rather than changing the way the business\nexperiences HR, real HR transformation should be about transforming the role\nof HR in business.\n\nAlready, much of HR's role in some organizations is being placed in legal, IT\nand finance, while the remaining parts of HR are focused on being internal\nconsultants to the business. HR transformations that restructure HR into\ncenters of excellence reinforce this idea of HR partners being internal\nexperts, consultants and advisers to the business.\n\n**HR needs to be integrated with business, and business needs to be integrated\nwith HR.** But is that all HR should be to the company? Consultants? Trainers?\nAdvisers? Partners? Should they be more? The answer is _yes_! There is a\nmissed opportunity for HR to change the way leaders lead and [managers\nmanage](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/251642/manager.aspx).\n\n### **Do You Know Your Company 's Current State of Executive Leadership and\nManagement?**\n\nThe state of leadership and management is broken, and HR transformation needs\nto be about building HR capabilities into managers and leaders. Some of this\nis already happening, but it needs to be accelerated with a stronger push if\nthings are going to change in a meaningful way in the years to come.\n\nGlobally, just [one in three](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/258197/why-\nleaders-employees-trust-don.aspx) employees strongly agree that they trust the\nleadership of their organization, and two-thirds believe there is [widespread\ncorruption in business](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/244973/future-work-\ntrust-download.aspx). Among U.S. employees,\n[15%](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/268310/leaders-craft-inspirational-\nstrategic-narrative.aspx) strongly agree that their leaders make them feel\nenthusiastic about the future, and 13% say the leadership of their\norganization communicates effectively. CEOs are leaving at [record-high\ndeparture rates](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/Succeeding-the-\nlong-serving-legend-in-the-corner-\noffice?gko=90171&utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_288437&utm_medium=copy),\nand CEO tenure has dropped from eight years to five. Mergers and acquisitions\nfail to realize their intended benefits [70% to\n90%](https://hbr.org/2016/06/ma-the-one-thing-you-need-to-get-\nright?utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_288437&utm_medium=copy) of the\ntime, with [47%](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/267494/stop-losing-talent-\nmerge-acquire.aspx) of key employees leaving within one year of the\ntransaction -- and 75% within three years.\n\nLife expectancies of companies are dropping dramatically. Fortune 1000 firms\nare now expected to last less than [15\nyears](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/il/Documents/human-\ncapital/HR_and_Business_Perspectives_on_The%20Future_of_Work.pdf?utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_288437&utm_medium=copy),\non average, and S&P firms only five years. People are running from leaders as\nfast as they can, and there needs to be a revolution to turn them around.\n\nGlobally, just one in three employees strongly agree that they trust the\nleadership of their organization, and two-thirds believe there is widespread\ncorruption in business.\n\nWhen it comes to managers, [only 35% are engaged at\nwork](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/259820/manager-experience-challenges-\nperk-perspective-paper.aspx). Employees worldwide are not inspired by the\nannual review conversations they're having with their manager (only\n[14%](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/215927/performance-management.aspx) say\nthey're inspired by their performance reviews). Employees in Europe and the\nU.S. say their organization isn't\n[agile](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/241295/future-work-agility-\ndownload.aspx) enough.\n\nThere needs to be a mindset shift in management -- a fundamental change to the\nphilosophy of management.\n\n### **Transform the HR Mindset, Career Paths and Training**\n\nReal HR transformation requires getting the cultural mindset shift right\n_before_ making the necessary technological or structural changes.\n\nFor example, Gallup's [Real Future of\nWork](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/232382/real-future-work.aspx) research\non European employees reveals that mindset defines agility much more than team\nstructure does. Make sure workers understand why your mission matters to them\npersonally; currently, only four in 10 U.S. employees feel connected to the\n[mission or purpose of their\ncompany](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236279/three-ways-mission-driven-\nworkplaces-perform-better.aspx). A 10% improvement in employees' connection\nwith the mission or purpose of their organization would result in an [8.1%\ndecrease](https://news.gallup.com/reports/191489/q12-meta-analysis-\nreport-2016.aspx) in turnover and a 4.4% increase in profitability.\n\nWhile leadership and management need a revolution, having HR double down on\nits strategy to consult and advise may not be the major course correction that\nbusinesses need.\n\nHR needs to become an\n[experience](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/265886/why-leaders-become-\nceo.aspx) for business leaders, and the business needs to become an experience\nfor HR leaders. HR leaders are positioned to increase human capital returns\nduring a merger and acquisition, conquer agility by creating a culture of\npsychological safety, and build trust internally and externally. Change the\npath to CEO, CFO, COO and CHRO. Don't cut them from the same cloth, which has\nproduced the current state of executive leadership.\n\nFor the largest companies, HR is getting more and more focused on workforce\nplanning, including upskilling, reskilling, workforce reduction and future-of-\nwork planning. To meet this growing demand, HR needs to transform from\ninternal consultants to leaders of the business. That doesn't necessarily mean\nputting HR in charge tomorrow. It does mean putting HR _into_ business leaders\nand managers today.\n\nHR can provide a set of skills that business leaders and managers need to\ndevelop. CEOs should have HR capabilities, not just HR partners, just as much\nas they should have financial capabilities and not just financial partners.\n\nHow this development is provided needs to go beyond training from HR and into\nexperiential training within HR. Gallup's research shows ethics training\nprograms have [limited impact](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/244973/future-\nwork-trust-download.aspx).\n\nEqually, upskilling and reskilling training does not increase training\nparticipants' confidence that the company is preparing them for the future\nnearly as much as creating an organization that is focused on building the\n[strengths](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/247514/strengths-based-\nculture.aspx) of each employee (nearly five times the impact of training) or\nmanagers who are great at providing ongoing feedback (twice the\n[impact](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/265934/future-work-issue-\ndisruption.aspx) of training).\n\n![Custom graphic. The skills of the future come from everyday conversations\nand strengths-based\ncultures.](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/9wwvmnowokmtyjg6sv_9ew.png)\n\nHR should provide training that teaches leaders and managers the soft skills\nthat drive change, such as focusing on\n[strengths](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253832/cliftonstrengths-\nfor-teams.aspx), instilling purpose, building relationships, providing\n[ongoing, meaningful\nfeedback](https://www.gallup.com/itsthemanager/245402/boss-to-coach.aspx), and\ncreating great team environments. Essentially, moving from boss to coach.\n\nIn a recent Gallup study, organizations that invested in learning programs\nusing the concepts of **strengths** , **engagement** and **ongoing performance\ndevelopment** realized a 14-percentage-point increase, on average, in the\nproportion of employees who were engaged -- compared with an average increase\nof eight points in companies that did not invest in learning programs.\nAdditionally, among 70 of the organizations included in the study, managers\nwho received training on these soft skills experienced _twice_ the\nproductivity gains of those among managers who didn't participate in these\nstrengths-based courses.\n\n![Line graph. Investing in strengths-based manager courses improves employee\nengagement.](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/tvhrcb59tkuzng4mh3wuvg.png)\n\nTraining alone won't prepare your workforce for the future, but creating great\nmanagers will -- and that's where training should focus.\n\n### **Take the Different Path in Leadership**\n\n**To HR leaders:** Lead the business as an HR leader rather than just leading\nHR programs. Do this by upskilling and reskilling the workforce with capable\nmanagers and not just capable curricula. Increase\n[diversity](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/215939/diversity-inclusion.aspx)\nin leadership by empowering leaders to individualize inclusion with strengths-\nbased approaches, rather than only managing generalized stereotypes and\ndemographics.\n\n**To business leaders:** Lead HR as a business leader rather than outsourcing\naspects of your leadership role to HR partners and HR technology. Remember,\nselection assessments exist to help managers make great decisions, not decide\nfor them.

The need for\nbetter internet infrastructure, investing in the necessary hardware and\nsoftware, but also the need to ensure that all employees can continue their\ndaily tasks, as well as their personal growth and career development.\n\n  * Here's our list of the [best video conferencing tools](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-video-conferencing-software) on the market\n  * [Working from home: the mouse, monitor, keyboard and router you need](https://www.techradar.com/news/working-from-home-everything-you-need-to-set-up-your-new-home-office)\n  * Here's our choice of the [best business webcams](https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/peripherals/what-webcam-5-reviewed-and-rated-1027972) of 2020\n\n## One size doesn't fit all\n\nIt\u2019s easy for companies with a huge number of white-collar workers to adjust\nto home working \u2013 it\u2019s simply business as usual. But this crisis highlights\nthat when we talk about technology and its application for HR, it works in\nfavour of office workers, to the detriment of blue-collar workers.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new revelation. Having attended a lot of HR-related conferences\nand events, they are centred around how technology can support employee\ndevelopment, performance management, and learning at work. But very often, the\nexamples and use cases are related to different kinds of office employees,\nfrom developers to sales and service people, or any type of job where you\nspend time at a desk and with a computer.\n\nWhat coronavirus illustrates is that anyone with geographical constraint is at\nrisk of being left aside by technology. If you\u2019re a factory or logistics\nworker, cashier in a supermarket or any local store, it\u2019s difficult to do your\njob remotely, and all this talk about working from home to avoid being sick\nmay seem like some kind of cruel joke.\n\n## Customising the fit\n\nNo organisation can afford to overlook the importance of its workers,\nespecially not right now, and with many companies already struggling to\nrecruit and retain blue collar workers, they need to be paying particular\nattention to these employees. Obviously, in a crisis situation like the one\nwe\u2019re currently facing, the first concern is to protect their health \u2013 this\nshould be a given.\n\nBut beyond these hopefully unique and unprecedented circumstances, how can\ntechnology support all employees, wherever they work, and whatever the tasks\nthey perform?\n\nThe objective should be the same as with white collar workers. Technology\nessentially aims to support employees to work better \u2013 be more efficient and\nproductive and to enable them to maximise their strengths and skills. And the\nsame should hold true whether they are in an office, on the factory or shop\nfloor or even on the move. Investing in all staff to help improve and acquire\nnew skills is not only about opening up new career opportunities but also the\nmeans for safeguarding and boosting the development and growth of your\nbusiness. The fact that these employees aren\u2019t in an office, however, will\ndefinitely impact the way you need to do this.\n\n## Investing in the design for the future\n\nClearly, for these workers, any investment you make in technology has to be\nmobile first. Luckily, this isn\u2019t as complex as it used to be. The number of\nactive phone users in the European Union is now above 50%, and android-based\n[smartphones](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-business-smartphone) and\n[tablets](https://www.techradar.com/news/best-business-tablets) have become\nmore affordable. This means that even if your organisation is unable to\nprovide work phones or tablets, you could opt for a 'bring your own device\u2019\nstrategy, allowing for workers to use their own. Cloud-based applications also\noften use individual logins so tablets, for example, can be shared in a\nbreakout room or communal space if needed. You will just have to make sure\nthat the factory, shop or warehouse has adequate WiFi.\n\nBeyond the tools to aid learning you also need to provide these workers with\nthe means and resources. That means making training easily available on those\nmobile devices. Make sure that you have relevant training on one easy-to-\naccess platform, offering a range of training courses and learning content to\nsuit different needs. When your employees are taking that break in the coffee\nroom from the shop or factory floor, for example, there should be quick,\ndigestible learning they can tap into \u2013 whether it be how to handle that\ndifficult customer they just served or in the current climate, better\npractices for staying safe.\n\nAs well as the employees themselves, managers also need to be able to keep an\neye on employees\u2019 progress and to see what training is being used the most,\nproving the most useful and where there may be potential weak spots and\ntraining gaps to be plugged. This is also the means to ensure that your\nemployees aren\u2019t just learning the skills for now but that they will also need\nin the future.\n\nMost importantly, let your employees learn. Grant them the time and\nopportunity to utilise these tools for their development.  In the same way\nthat re-stocking the shelves may be a standard go-to daily task, make\nundertaking some learning an integrated part of their work too.\n\nBlue collar workers represent a huge talent pool, who are often overlooked,\ndespite having key roles. They likely already possess a huge amount of\nknowledge about your company, and work in direct contact either with your\nproducts (in factories, for example) or with your customers (such as in\nstores). By making technology work for them as well and giving them access to\ndevelopment tools and opportunities, you will enable these employees to share\ntheir skills, improve overall knowledge across your organisation and best of\nall, bolster your business success.\n\n _Geoffroy De Lestrange is Communication Director EMEA at_[ _Cornerstone\nOnDemand_](https://www.cornerstoneondemand.co.uk/)\n\n  * Here's our list of the [best online collaboration tools](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-online-collaboration-tools) available\n\n[See more Computing news ](https://www.techradar.com/news/computing)\n\n__Tech deals, prizes and latest news\n\nGet the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable\ntech news and more!\n\nThank you for signing up to TechRadar.

](mailto:enquiries@relocatemagazine.co.uk)\n\nWith government and employer responses to the COVID-19 pandemic accenting\npersonal wellbeing as never before, Mercer\u2019s _2020 Global Talent Trends_ study\nidentifies what it believes are the four trends leaders can harness to \u201c[win\nwith empathy](/articles/leadership-hr-talent-management-renewing-your-license-\nto-lead-blakey-sp20)\u201d now and post-pandemic for international organisations\nand those with globally mobile employees.With the current global health crises\npotentially set to accelerate these themes, Mercer\u2019s\n[survey](https://www.uk.mercer.com/our-thinking/career/global-talent-\ntrends-2020.html) of 7,300+ c-suite executives, HR leaders and employees in 34\ncountries finds that employers are navigating uncertainty with an amplified\nfocus on the health, financial wellbeing and careers of their employees. This\nis putting [HR in the frontline](/articles/events-cipd-ace-2019-putting-\nglobal-people-at-the-heart-of-good-work-1119) of driving organisational\nchange.\n\n## COVID-19 catalysing workplace changes\n\nThe [COVID-19](/articles/health-talent-management-relocate-global-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-resource-centre-0320-reeditor) pandemic and subsequent uncertainty\nare \u201c[accelerating changes](/articles/leadership-talent-management-using-\nemergent-strategies-to-lead-effectively-sshortland-sp20) in the way\norganisations around the world are working and will continue to work into the\nfuture,\u201d says Mercer. With wage growth predicted to be stagnant by 63% of HR\nleaders surveyed and 34% of employees expecting their jobs to be replaced in\nthree years, [purpose](/articles/editorial-festival-of-global-\npeople-12924-how-can-purpose-help-us-in-these-uncertain-times-rholmes) and\nemployee engagement are set to be key, says the consultancy.\n\n## People-centred approaches to managing uncertainty\n\n\u201cBalancing economics and empathy in all people decisions is important, even\nmore so now as we face questions, concerns and the uncertainty of a global\npandemic,\u201d said Ilya Bonic, President, Career and Head of Strategy at Mercer.\n\u201cOrganisations need to have a financial model and cultural mindset that\nenables them to prepare for and invest in the future.\u201d\u201cThis rethinking of\npurpose and priorities is vital across the organisation, but especially for\nHR,\u201d continued Ilya Bonic. \u201cThe findings from this year\u2019s study make it clear\nthat transformation of the HR function is a key component to creating a\nsustainable organisation.\u201d\n\n## Four global talent trends for 2020\n\nMercer\u2019s study identifies four trends for 2020:\n\n###  **1\\. Future focus**\n\nWith a new mandate for business, 85% of executives agree that the\norganisation\u2019s purpose should extend beyond shareholder primacy. Yet only 35%\nof companies deliver on this today.One in three employees say they would\nprefer to work for an employer that shows responsibility towards all\nstakeholders, beyond just shareholders and investors.Much of an organisation\u2019s\nsuccess depends on whether it can support its talent to grow and shape a\nsustainable business, says Mercer. Over two-thirds of executives (68%) want to\nfocus more on environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals.For employees,\n61% of employees trust their employer to prepare them for the future of work.\nHowever, 63% feel at risk of burnout.Career pipelines also have tightened as\n72% of experienced workers say they plan to work past retirement age. Just\nover half (55%) of Gen Xers say opportunities to advance are limited because\nof longevity in the workplace.Better management of older workers is part of\ncreating shared value, believes Mercer. More than three-quarters (78%) of\nemployees want long-term financial planning, yet just 23% of companies say\nthey provide financial education for employees today.\u201cOrganisations that\nsuccessfully navigate the turbulent times ahead will be those who champion\nempathy to maximise returns for all shareholders, employees and society\nalike,\u201d said Laura McKim, Partner and UK Career Business Leader at Mercer.For\nmanagers and employers with a global and globally mobile workforce, employees\u2019\nmost-valued career support is personal and professional growth opportunities\n(73%) across most regions.In Asia, knowing what skills will become important\nor obsolete in the future tops the list (71%), while in Africa employees value\nmanagers who can have useful career conversations no matter their life stage\n(72%). The UK is aligned to the global trend in that 70% of employees feel\nthat their company gives them the space to learn and grow, both professionally\nand personally.Together, these data suggest the important role workplace and\ncareer [coaching](/articles/cipd-hr-cipd-2019-bringing-good-work-to-life-with-\ncoachingnovember-2019-rholmes) can have in supporting employees meet their\nprofessional goals.\n\n### 2\\. Race to reskill\n\nReskilling is the talent investment most capable of driving business success.\nAlmost every respondent organisation (99%) is embarking on transformation and\nreporting significant skill gaps.Workforce capability and lack of future\nskills was the top reason transformations failed. Although 78% of employees\nglobally say they are ready to learn new skills, 38% claim they do not have\nenough time for training.Moreover, just 34% of HR leaders are investing in\nworkforce learning and reskilling as part of their strategy to prepare for the\nfuture of work and 40% do not know what skills their workforce has today.\u201cJob\nrequirements are changing and the responsibility for upskilling, reskilling\nand redeployment needs to be shared between employers and employees,\u201d said\nLisa Lyons, UK Leadership and Workforce Transformation Practice Lead at\nMercer.\u201cWhere organisations see less demand for certain skills and increased\ndemand for others, they should look to identify people with transferable\nskills and provide reskilling opportunities.\u201dAcross regions, employees say\ninnovation will be the top in-demand skill in the next 12 months. HR leaders\nin North America and Latin America agree with their employees. The United\nKingdom follows this trend, with employees and HR leaders agreeing that\ninnovation is a top priority. Elsewhere, however, HR leaders put digital\nmarketing (Africa, Europe, Middle East, Pacific) and data visualisation at the\ntop (Asia).\n\n### 3\\. Sense with science\n\nAdvances in machine learning continue to permeate across industries and ways\nof life. The use of predictive analytics has nearly quadrupled in five years\n(from 10% in 2016 to 39% today). Yet, only:\n\n  * 43% of organisations use metrics to identify employees likely to leave\n  * 41% know when critical talent is likely to retire\n  * 18% know the impact of pay strategies on performance\n  * 15% can determine if it is better to buy/build/borrow employees\n  * 12% are using analytics to correct inequities and prevent them recurring.\n\nOther forms of employee engagement data gathering are on the rise too. Six in\nten (62%) companies use pulse surveys and 33% plan to invest in this in\n2020.While machines outperform humans at tasks related to scale and speed,\nhumans outpace machines at sense-checking and judgement, which are critical\nelements of ethical decision-making.Two-thirds (67%) of HR leaders are\nconfident they can ensure AI is not institutionalising bias, ethics codes\nabout the collection. However, the application and implications of people\nanalytics are still in their infancy.Talent assessment is equally an area\nwhere human intuition is needed along with the digital assessments \u2013 only one\nin two employees (52%) report a positive assessment experience. \u201cThe\navailability of data and capability of analytics has increased but with great\ndata comes great responsibility, the challenge is for organisations to use it\neffectively to inform strategy through ethical means. The challenge for\ncompanies lies in balancing the protection of personal data and the\ninterrogation of this data to drive strategic decision making,\u201d said Laura\nMcKim, Partner and UK Career Business Leader at Mercer.Across regions,\ndisconnects exist between the analytics the C-suite prioritises and those HR\nleaders provide. In the Pacific, 53% of HR leaders provide analytics on the\nC-suite\u2019s second top priority as to why one team is high performing and\nanother struggles. Yet, only 39% are providing analytics on the top priority\naround key drivers of engagement.In mature markets, like the United Kingdom,\nonly 49% are using analytics to identify the key drivers of pay inequities \u2013\nthe C-suite\u2019s top priority.\n\n### 4\\. Energising the employee experience\n\nDelivering on the employee experience is HR\u2019s top priority: 58% of\norganisations are redesigning to become more people-centric. Yet, only 27% of\nexecutives believe employee experience will yield a business return. There is\nalso a mismatch between the 61% of employees who trust their employer to look\nafter their well-being; and the 48% of executives who rank it as a top\nworkforce concern and 29% of HR leaders that a health and well-being strategy.\nThis is not an area to be missed, says Mercer, as employees whose company is\nfocused on employee health and well-being are four times more likely to be\nenergised.Energised employees are essential to realise organisations\u2019\ntransformation agenda: they are more likely to stay, more resilient and more\nready to reskill. HR transformation is high on organisations\u2019 agenda and\ndelivering on the employee experience requires HR to step out of its\nfunctional silos.However, only 40% of HR leaders say they have an integrated\npeople strategy. \u201cInteractions with employees matter, but often our focus on\nHR process and efficiency creates an unappealing candidate and employee\nexperience,\u201d said Laura McKim. \u201cOrganisations that approach the employee\nexperience in the same way they would the customer experience, where a premium\nis placed on employee interactions and system and process design comes second,\nwill have better success in engaging employees.\u201cNever more than now has\nplacing employees\u2019 interests at the heart of our businesses been more timely\nor important.\u201d Improving the employee experience tops HR\u2019s future of work\npriorities in Europe, North America and the Middle East, with the UK aligning\nwith this trend. Asia and Pacific put transforming talent practices\n(recruitment, performance management and succession) in the top spot.\n\n## Read more [talent management news and features](/talent-management) from\n_Relocate Global_\n\n* * *\n\n **[Subscribe to Relocate\nExtra](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/magazineregistration?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=reg),\nour monthly newsletter, to get all the latest international assignments and\nglobal mobility news.** **Relocate\u2019s new[Global Mobility\nToolkit](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/global-mobility-toolkit-download-\nour-preview-factsheet?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=gmtt)\nprovides free information, practical advice and support for HR, global\nmobility managers and global teams operating overseas.** **[![Global Mobility\nToolkit download factsheets resource centre](/media/images/RELO-GM-\nTOOLKIT-432x172-v2_12993_t5.jpg)](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/global-\nmobility-toolkit-download-our-preview-\nfactsheet?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=gmtbutton)**\n**[Access](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/directory?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=dir)\nhundreds of global services and suppliers in our Online Directory** **[![Click\nto get to the Relocate Global Online\nDirectory](/media/images/ScreenShot2016-09-20at171042_9694_t5.png)](/directory)**\n\n\u00a92020 Re:locate magazine, published by Profile Locations, Spray Hill, Hastings\nRoad, Lamberhurst, Kent TN3 8JB.

and the use of technology in place of\npersonal interaction brings the genuine danger of HR losing touch with\nemployees. The new face of HR should not be faceless.\n\n![HR is a contact sport](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1586178442/1586178441.jpg)\n\nThe factory looked like a war-zone. Much company property had been destroyed.\nThere were serious injuries. I won\u2019t reveal the nature of the injuries or when\nthis episode took place to prevent the organization where it happened from\nbeing identified. Besides, such explosions are frequent enough for us not to\nprobe the specifics of a particular instance. In nine out of ten cases of\nviolence at the workplace, the management is taken totally by surprise and has\nno time to plan counter-measures, leave aside preempt the conflagration. While\nmany people have analyzed the fundamental causes of industrial violence, my\nlimited purpose here is to understand why early warning systems, which could\nhave prevented the worst excesses, failed and how we can prevent such failures\nthat repeatedly catch us with descended lower-garments.\n\nThe single thread that is common to almost all workplace violence is a break\nin the chain of face-to-face communication between people at the Bottom of the\nPyramid and HR/ER people whose reports reach top decision-makers. The greater\nworry is that the newer models we are adopting for organizing and managing HR\nmake catastrophic failures in feedback channels more rather than less likely.\n\n> The height of fashion nowadays is to find a tech solution to every issue.\n> For example, grievance handling, that required all the skills of naturally\n> intelligent and sensitive humans to resolve is now proudly declared to be\n> the domain of artificially intelligent and utterly insensitive bots\n\n### Losing touch\n\nThe example at the start of this column illustrates the most prevalent reason\nfor HR losing personal touch with its most important constituency \u2013 people.\nWhile ever greater proportions of value-add have been shoveled into the hands\nof contract workers, the redirection of HR attention to what has, in many\norganizations, become the larger part of the workforce, is not just inadequate\nbut negligible. Rare is the ER/IR manager who actually meets with members of\nthe precariat even occasionally, and with a grievance resolution mindset.\nSmall wonder then that embers of discontent smouldering in that part of the\nworking population are overlooked till they burst into uncontrollable flames.\nYet, even if Indian industry gets over its addiction to contracted1 or\nuberized workers (I hope I have sufficient rebirths left to see either happen)\nor learns to give them the same ER care and support as it extends to its\nregular workforce, there are other fast-growing fashion trends that are\ndrastically reducing face-to-face communications with employees.\n\n> HR interactions obviously don\u2019t need to stop only with listening. The reason\n> conversations with HR can be more practically beneficial are the skills the\n> HR practitioner is expected to demonstrate in counselling employees to get a\n> more realistic perception of their problems\n\nFirst comes the noble-sounding (but actually lazy) program to push HR tasks\n(especially the ones that can\u2019t be done in air-conditioned comfort behind the\nprotection of a computer monitor or in the luxury of a posh training centre)\nto line managers. The first casualty of the offloading drive is the messy but\nessential need to meet employees at all levels regularly. Don\u2019t get me wrong.\nIt is important for line managers also to be in touch with their teams through\nnon-task interactions. But there is no law that prevents a second channel of\ncommunication from being set up via HR. The value of such a parallel path\nbecomes blindingly obvious when the channel through the chain of command\nbecomes blocked or distorted, as it can all too easily in times of churn or\nstaffing by inexperienced supervisors. Even worse is the situation when the\nproblem to be reported lies somewhere within the same reporting hierarchy or\nwhen that channel is mis-utilized to message what suits an ambitious manager\u2019s\nagenda. If HR has given up its own eyes and ears, its people are reduced to\nbeing dumb Myrmidons, powerless to confirm or contradict faulty reports\nemanating through the line conduit, and simply carrying out their demands.\n\nAnother surefire recipe to lose touch with one\u2019s own people is to outsource\nthose activities of HR that yield a large volume of interactions across\nlevels. What is sneeringly called HR operations and considered untouchable by\nthe upper caste business partner elites is actually a treasure trove of\ninformation about what is truly happening and of all the corns and callouses\naffecting employee satisfaction. What is an extremely valuable by-product of\nproviding an employee service in-house, by the HR business partner, evaporates\nwithout a trace when it is outsourced and almost to the same extent when it is\ncentralized.\n\nThe height of fashion nowadays, of course, is to find a tech solution to every\nissue. For example, grievance handling, that required all the skills of\nnaturally intelligent and sensitive humans to resolve is now proudly declared\nto be the domain of artificially intelligent and utterly insensitive bots.\nWhile much of the debate in the community today is about whether chatbots can\ndo what a human HR professional does (and of the dangerous snafus they can\ncause)2, my concern here is the loss of face-to-face contact such a\nsubstitution brings. Bot solutions are doubly disadvantageous in this context.\nIn the first place, they leave employees feeling shortchanged that the\norganization doesn\u2019t deem them worthy of a person listening to their concerns\n(surely top management doesn\u2019t get bottled up like this). Even if employees\u2019\nproblems are solved, it is unlikely that they will feel grateful and indebted\n\u2013 those are not sentiments that can easily be felt towards bots or\ntransferred, from them, to organizations. Secondly, it will be very difficult\nfor bots to extract information of the preemptive type we have been discussing\nout of standard service requests and day-to-day grievances. Information that\ncan be used to forestall IR breakdowns, formulate policies or identify\nindividuals for progression or observation are by nature equivocal.\n\"Equivocality means ambiguity, the existence of multiple and conflicting\ninterpretations about an organizational situation\u2026 Equivocality means that\nasking a yes-no question is not feasible\u2026 The key factor in equivocality\nreduction is the extent to which structural mechanisms facilitate the\nprocessing of rich information.\"3 At the top of the ranking for dealing with\nrich communication is our humble, age-old accessory: face-to-face\ncommunication. Bots don\u2019t even enter the rankings.\n\n### Know your people\n\nUncovering or predicting disruptions in industrial harmony are certainly not\nthe only, or even the most important, benefits of Human Resources having\nregular human-to-human contact at all levels in the organization. Let\u2019s look\nat some more significant and hard-to-replace gains from this contact sport.\n\nCases abound of major transformation initiatives in highly regarded companies\ncoming to grief simply because they had no process in place for sounding out a\ncross section of employees before embarking on a major policy change affecting\nthem. Ongoing face-to-face contacts are not just invaluable for anticipating\nreactions to substantive people policy revisions (and possibly tweaking them\nin the direction of greater acceptability). They are equally useful for\nevaluating reactions on the ground once changes are announced and making quick\ncourse corrections before reactions and resistances reach the point when they\ncan only be assuaged by the bathwater, the baby and the baby\u2019s father, all\nbeing thrown out.\n\n> Listening to people and solving individual problems are as much a core part\n> of an HR person\u2019s job as the grandiose visioning, meticulous planning and\n> flawless execution that are more easily assessed and rewarded\n\nAnother of the great advantages of face-to-face communication is that it is\ntwo way. Apart from using the opportunity to understand what is bothering\nemployees or gauging their reactions to impending policy pronouncements, such\ncontacts provide the perfect setting for credible communication of what is\nimportant to the company. There are plans and responses to competition that\nare difficult to explain believably in writing or through other one-way\nchannels. Moreover, when disaffected employees, hostile unions or unfriendly\noutsiders are spreading disinformation and it is deemed unwise even to\nacknowledge it by giving a documentary response, these meetings are among the\nfew ways in which employee opinion can be kept firmly favorable.\n\nOver the decades I have been privileged to observe the performance of hundreds\nof young men and women in HR/ER. One characteristic that distinguished those\nwho had a natural flair for dealing with people (and, hence, their outstanding\nsuccess in HR) was their insistence on spending most of their time with the\npeople they were supporting rather than at their tables in their offices.\nToday, those tables carry colorful computer screens with all the attractions\n(strictly professional, of course) the cloud has on offer and the offices are\nairconditioned. But if youngsters find it more difficult to tear themselves\naway from their work stations now, the need to meet with people in person has\nalso become more acute because transitory tenures demand more frequent\nmeetings if trust has to build before individuals move on. It is not only the\ndevelopment of young HR professionals that is assisted by constant people\ninteractions. It remains one of the few ways by which senior leaders\n(including CHROs) can keep their feet on the ground and retain a feel for what\nis happening at the grassroot level.\n\n### Help your people\n\nAs important as keeping HR aware of the reality on the ground and equipping it\nto craft successful policies and processes is the way in which regular face-\nto-face interactions with people can resolve issues troubling individual\nemployees before they fester into disaffection, destruction or departure. On\nthe positive side, there is also no substitute for such individual meetings by\nHR in the recipe for building commitment and belongingness among employees at\nlarge. By just listening to the problems, concerns and aspirations of\nindividuals, HR is signaling its commitment to the welfare and happiness of\npeople. No friend, however patient and available, can reaffirm the\nindividual\u2019s worth to the organization in this manner. It needs the commitment\nof a HUMAN Resource by HR to substantiate its stated intent of caring for\npeople. Of course, this requires that HR professionals are trained in active\nlistening4 so that the impact is positive even in those instances where they\ncannot provide useful counsel or more direct help.\n\nHR interactions obviously don\u2019t need to stop only with listening. The reason\nconversations with HR can be more practically beneficial than talking things\nover with a friend or even a line supervisor are the skills the HR\npractitioner is expected to demonstrate in counselling employees to get a more\nrealistic perception of their problems while tapping their internal reservoir\nof strengths in coping with them. In addition to counselling is also the\nknowledge-base HR professionals should have about which policy or avenue of\nappeal is likely to be most efficacious. This should be supplemented by case\nknowledge of how employees in other parts of the organization have been aided\nin similar situations.\n\nWhile not always possible, there are a significant number of opportunities for\nHR practioners to intervene directly and solve problems. These interventions\nmay take the form of talking things over with the line manager (especially if\ns/he is the origin of the problem), championing the employee\u2019s case where\nthere is discretion in the hands of a senior HR or line decision-maker or\nproviding some limited coaching in overcoming an internal barrier to the\nproblem resolution. An external shared-service provider is hardly ever in a\nposition or sufficiently motivated to provide such help and an AI-bot is\nobviously much less so. Even if they were capable, the gratitude and\nconsequential commitment would not flow back to the company or to HR and\nwould, therefore, not be available for future 'drawal' when individual\nemployee support (aggregated over many instances) can make all the difference\nin managing a crisis or a transformation program.\n\nA competent HR professional with a well-tuned antenna should also be able to\nprovide secondary guidance to an employee. The initial contact may arise from\nan internal job interview, an employee approaching with a grievance or an\nemployee contact program but, as part of the dialogue, the HR interlocutor may\ndiscover an employee\u2019s talents, contact networks or side interests that could\nbe useful in another assignment or as a member of a task team or a voluntary\nactivity \u2013 something that may have never come to light otherwise.\n\n### Actively reaching all\n\nListening to people and solving individual problems are as much a core part of\nan HR person\u2019s job as the grandiose visioning, meticulous planning and\nflawless execution that are more easily assessed and rewarded. Those seemingly\ntrivial interruptions by individual employees, far from being distractions,\nare HR\u2019s special moments of truth5 which demonstrate, employee by employee,\nwhether the knowledge, skills and empathy with which we claim to be so well-\nstocked, can actually be converted to practical problem resolution which, in\nturn, builds good will towards HR and the organization at large.\n\nOf course, employees feeling the need and having the trust to approach HR with\ntheir problems are just one source of opportunities for interaction. There are\nmyriads of others which fall into the laps of HR practitioners without any\neffort on their part. They can come from processes as varied as Q&A during\ntraining programs, counseling for late-coming, absenteeism or indiscipline\nhandling and even from exit interviews. Regardless of the process of origin,\neach of these opportunities for face-to-face interaction can help employees\nsolve problems and get developmental aid while yielding valuable feedback to\nand positive affect for the organization.\n\nRich as the yields may be from the interactions initiated by employees or\nother people processes, they cannot possibly cover all employees. In my bible,\nunless each employee is personally 'touched' by an HR person on a regular\nbasis, HR is failing in one of key roles \u2013 knowing and solving people problems\nboth individually and systemically. To achieve this goal, organizations need\nto institute programs for reaching out to every single employee on multiple\noccasions each year. Every HR person from the CHRO down and including the ones\nworking in back office or routine clerical roles should spend between half to\na full day every week on this activity. For those HR people who do not meet\ncross-sections of employees as part of their job, these meetings would yield\nthe secondary benefit of knowing the reality and reactions of the ultimate\ncustomers who their policies or back office work support. To prevent the\nexercise from being threatening or perfunctory, those unused to employee\ninteractions would need to be given a brief orientation and everyone would\nutilize a basic checklist for the meeting followed by a brief on-line report.\n\n> In my bible, unless each employee is personally 'touched' by an HR person on\n> a regular basis, HR is failing in one of key roles - knowing and solving\n> people problems both individually and systemically\n\n### Drop by drop\n\nCan such simple meetings really add up to much? Should they take us away from\nthe killer schemes that win us awards and get our names plastered all over the\nmedia? Thought leadership and pioneering projects are immensely fulfilling and\nperiodically essential. However, they cannot substitute the most fundamental\nand frequently used tool in the HR person\u2019s kit: the face-to-face meeting. At\nsuch times it is useful to remember (a slightly tweaked version of) Julia\nCarney\u2019s poem6 for children,\n\n_Little drops of water  \n_ _Little grains of sand,  \n_ _Make the mighty ocean,  \n_ _And the pleasant land.  \n_ _\u2026.  \n_ _Little deeds of kindness,  \n_ _Little words of cheer,  \n_ _Make our people happy,  \n_ _And drive away their fear._\n\n_Notes:_\n\n_1.[Visty Banaji, Udta Udyog \u2013 Industry\u2019s addiction to contract workers,\nPeople Matters, 15th September\n2016.](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/temporary-and-contract-\nstaffing/udta-udyogindustrys-addiction-to-contract-workers-14090)_\n\n_2\\.

her\nnotebook](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/transforming_performance_management_woman_writing_on_her_notebook.jpg)\n\nThe annual performance review is under attack, and for good reason.  Many HR\nprofessionals say it has outlived its usefulness.\n\n\"When we're talking about performance management, many companies are moving\naway from the annual review and moving to more conversations as part of an\nongoing process,\" Irena Behery said.  She is the Vice President and Head of\nTalent Management and Learning for Beacon Health Options.\n\nThe reason this is happening isn't difficult to understand.  For one, the\nperformance review comes from a different time; a different era or work.  The\nstatistics back up that claim.  According to SHRM, 95 percent of [employees\nare dissatisfied with their companies' performance review\nprocess](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-\nrelations/pages/what-about-teams.aspx).  Taking it a step further, Gallup says\nthese reviews simply don't motivate employees to step up their game.\n\n> \"The [purpose of performance management is to improve quality of\n> work](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238064/re-engineering-performance-\n> management.aspx), productivity, and other business outcomes, but traditional\n> approaches have consistently fallen short.\" ~Gallup~\n\n# Performance Management\n\n## Defining the Strategy\n\nWhile there is a lot of attention on the performance review, it is only a\nsmall piece of the overall performance management strategy.  So, what is\nperformance management?  Our [guide on talent\nmanagement](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/articles/talent-management-guide) defines the strategy as such:\n\n> _Performance Management_ - Once hired, talent is expected to perform at a\n> high standard.  This process includes the way in which HR measures and\n> improves performance.  Common procedures include performance reviews, one-\n> on-one meetings, and reward and recognition programs.\n\n## Change is in the Air\n\nHaving explained that, Behery believes what we know of performance management\nis changing.\n\n\"When you're thinking about that engagement and having a conversation with an\nemployee every day\u2026 how do you reward, how do you recognize\u2026 it is not just\nthe program that I put you in or a little reward I give you that you can put\non a wall.  It is that human reaction and recognizing the work they're doing\nevery day,\" Behery said.\n\n> Whitepaper:  [Creating a Caring Culture to Attract and Retain\n> Talent](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\n> engagement/whitepapers/creating-a-caring-culture-to-attract-and-retain-\n> talent)\n\nThe Head of Gap's Talent Planning and Performance, Rob Ollander-Krane, agrees\nwith Behery.  In fact, he takes it a step further and offers a plan of action.\n\n\"If we really want to revolutionize performance management, we have to have a\nbalanced scorecard that impacts compensation,\" Ollander-Krane said.  \"In our\ncompany, we have 7 goals that impact bonus funding at the end of the year.\nSix of those are connected to the business and one is connected to HR\u2026 and\nit's the first time we've ever had one connected to HR.  It's not a lofty\ngoal.  It's says that 70% of our 143 critical roles in the company are 0-2\nyear bench.  That's all it says.  And that seems like not a very high bar to\njump, but boy, when we put that in there did that start to change behavior.\"\n\nOllander-Krane said as a result senior leaders really began to focus on\ntalent, how to assess talent and develop talent.  In short, he says they\nstarted to have real conversations around the topic for the first time.\n\nGap isn't the only company making changes to the overall strategy.\n[Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/insights/performance-\nmanagement) says\u2026\n\n> \"Many organizations are reinventing their performance management processes\n> by either de-emphasizing or eliminating annual performance reviews and\n> introducing more frequent check-ins. These changes are being made with the\n> goal of improving employee engagement, productivity, and retention. The\n> trending belief is that traditional performance management focuses on the\n> past and that reviews occur too infrequently to effectively course-correct\n> performance or engagement issues. Employees are actually demotivated by a\n> performance process that seems to be disconnected from their ongoing\n> efforts.\"\n\n## Performance Management of the Future\n\nEmployees, like their managers, and the executives above them, still have jobs\nto do however. You have to be able to make sure that the needs of the business\nare being met and that everyone is doing their part.\n\nPerformance management will always be there to help ensure that this is\nhappening, but what will it look like?\n\nHitachi's chief transformation officer, Levent Arabaci, envisions future\nperformance management \"as a tool that is embraced by business leaders to\nachieve results and is utilized not only once a year but as part of an ongoing\nfeedback mechanism to develop employees and managers.\"\n\nThat mechanism can be anything from coaching to social feedback tools.  Other\nexamples include [rewards and\nrecognition](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-compensation-\nbenefits/webinars/cultivating-a-culture-based-rr-program-through-technology),\npulse-survey tools and gamification.  At the end of the day, performance\nmanagement will always need to be fair and beneficial to all.\n\n> NEXT:  [Strategic HR - Is That\n> Realistic](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/shared-\n> services/columns/strategic-hr-is-that-realistic)\n\n**_Want more content faster?

But the toughest challenge,\nregardless of where your workforce works from, is to keep your employees\nengaged, motivated and happy.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)![](https://indicanews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Madhukar-scaled.jpg)Madhukar Govindaraju\n\nMadhukar Govindaraju, Founder and CEO of\n[Numly](https://www.numly.io/)[TM](https://www.numly.io/), says that the team\nat Numly\u2122 has successfully developed a game-changing innovation, by applying\nAdvanced Data Science and AI to drive employee engagement in medium and large\nenterprises, and to accelerate professional and business growth through the\ncultivation of soft skills.\n\nGovindaraju believes that knowledge sharing has to be the underpinning of any\nemployee engagement process. With Numly\u2122, the company is leading with people\nnetworking, skills coaching and advanced data science to usher in the future\nof remote work.\n\nMost recently in 2018, Govindaraju embarked on a journey, yet again in his\ncareer, from an experienced executive in the software industry to a serial\nentrepreneur. With more than two decades of experience in the software\nindustry as a GM/Product Executive, CTO, SVP Engineering, and business leader,\nat some of the world\u2019s leading software companies, such as VMware, Microsoft,\nTriNet HR Group, Saba Software, SAP / Business Objects, Hyperion Solutions,\nHP, IBM, and several successful startups, Govindaraju has seen it all when it\ncomes to initiatives on employee engagement, employee performance management,\nequity, diversity, inclusivity and leadership development programs at global\nworkplaces.\n\nBut in reality, Govindaraju believes that these programs often get drowned by\nage-old HR customs and rigid adherence to red-tape like rules, something that\ncompanies are still struggling with.\n\nSharing about his own experiences, in a global software behemoth, wherein he\nhad to deal with rejection and stonewalling from his HR Business Partners when\nhe tried to push for deserving and talented candidates for promotions and\ngrowth opportunities, only due to antiquated HR policies relating to\npromotions based on seniority, \u201cpromotion velocity coefficients\u201d and \u201clength-\nin-level\u201d metrics, under the umbrella of \u201ctop talent\u201d and \u201chigh-potential\u201d\ntalent management.\n\nGovindaraju says, he has personally seen brilliant and smart employees leave\norganizations they liked to work for, because the companies (and their HR\nteams that manage workplace culture) were riddled with ineffective employee\ndevelopment initiatives that emphasized maintaining hierarchical power growth\nrather than engagement and growth of future leaders. Women and millennials are\nthe most affected by this apathy that is often seen in big or large\norganizations. It has been the driving factor in my quest to find a solution\nthat can help companies improve employee engagement, performance, and\nproductivity; identify, attract, and retain top talent as well as grow the\nnext generation of business leaders.\n\nIt is hardly surprising that with remote working growing at such a phenomenal\npace, personalized employee development has become even more difficult than\nbefore. It has become imperative for organizations to invest in solutions that\nwill help them coach, train and develop a skilled workforce, irrespective of\ntheir location.\n\n\n\n ** _But what does it mean to engage teams working remotely? Can Advanced Data\nScience and AI be applied to this problem?_**\n\n ****\n\n**Identify high-potential remote employees**\n\nWith companies facing acute shortage of hireable skilled employees, they are\nnow looking internally within their workforce to identify and nurture high-\npotential employees who can fuel their leadership pipeline. But lack of\ncommunication between employees or departments working in silos owing to\nphysical distance can lead to discontent, lowered motivation levels, and low\nproductivity.\n\nSimilar to any in-house workforce, companies have to find a way to give equal\nopportunities to their remote workforce to develop and grow in their careers.\nEnsuring clear, open, and transparent communication along with a secure way to\ngive proactive feedback is necessary to enable employees at work. Absence of\nface-to-face interactions should not be a roadblock to identify hard-working\nemployees and help them navigate in their career graph.\n\n **Provide opportunities for soft skills development**\n\nRemote workers, in general, get the short end of the stick when it comes to\nskill development focus by organizations, compared to their other\ncounterparts.\n\nWhile it is easier to identify technical skill, development needs of the\nworkforce, power skills such as problem-solving, communication, decision\nmaking, and collaboration, that help employees navigate challenges at their\nworkplace can be difficult to train. The result will be the creation of a more\nmature and well-rounded [leadership](https://numly.io/the-leaders-role-in-\nemployee-engagement/) pipeline, with polished power skills that complement\ntechnical skills.\n\n **Drive self-development**\n\nTo engage teams located remotely, self-development can be an enticing factor\npromoted to employees. But it can be a tricky art to master, in the absence of\ndirection, especially when it comes to an individual\u2019s career path.\n\nRemote workers can find it hard to know which skills to improve and focus on,\nespecially in the absence of everyday interactions, leading to dejection and\nflagging engagement. Organizations have to put in the effort to keep their\nemployees self-motivated and pushing for self-development. Leveraging tests\nlike 16 Personality Factor (16PF) Assessments can help organizations identify\ntheir skill gap, and development needs of their workforce quantitatively.\n\nOrganizations can then leverage this information to coach their remote\nworkforce to navigate their soft & power skills chasm and drive business\ngrowth.\n\n **Say goodbye to generic engagement programs**\n\nOrganizations all over the world use archaic, one-size-fits-all [engagement\nprograms](https://numly.io/lets-talk-about-the-building-blocks-of-great-\nemployee-experience/), that are mostly Survey-tool based. For example: Annual\nEngagement Surveys, Performance Feedback Surveys, etc. These programs don\u2019t\nreally deliver measurable results and they definitely do not help in engaging\na remote workforce. Today\u2019s workforce, including the Millennials, are quite\nvocal about their demands for personalized engagement programs, such as\ninnovation engineering, new hire skill development, inside sales coaching,\ncustomer success team skills coaching, sales management coaching, and many\nmore. By taking a tailored approach towards the skills development needs of\nyour remote workforce, organizations can achieve phenomenal improvements in\nengagement levels, even in remote teams.\n\nOrganizations should also foster shared values, ensure that employees,\nirrespective of where they are located, are bound by common work principles\nand attitudes. These values have to be communicated clearly, and repeatedly to\nyour remote workforce in order to boost engagement with remote teams.\n\nGovindaraju believes that Numly\u2019s AI-enhanced, people networking and coaching\nplatform - [NumlyEngage](https://www.numly.io/)[TM](https://www.numly.io/) is\nthe need of the hour for companies as they scramble to find a way to connect\nand engage with their work-from-home employees.\n\nAccording to a 2019 Workday-Bloomberg survey, companies are 42 percent more\nconcerned about soft skills than they\u2019re about hard skills. Soft skills have\nbecome increasingly important in the age of robotic process automation, as\ncompanies need them to build bench strength, grow the next generation of\nleaders, and effectively compete in the Future of Work.\n[NumlyEngage\u2122](https://www.numly.io/) addresses these needs directly. It\u2019s an\ninnovative platform that enables the development of soft skills through\npersonalized coaching, in a structured and consistent manner, enhanced by\nMachine Learning and AI.\n\n\n\n###

human resources officers (CHROs) to chief people officers,\nsenior leadership in HR has witnessed a sea change in the last decade. What\ntrends will define employees and the workplace of the future? Are chief people\nofficers equipped to navigate the future of work?_**\n\nThe role of the chief people officer emerged to introduce employee-centricity\ninto the HR ecosystem. Instead of (or in addition to) the administrative\ngovernance that the [chief human resources officer\n(CHRO)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/leadership-succession/chief-\nhuman-resources-officer-role/) is tasked with, a chief people officer must\nlook after the company culture, employee experience, and how people assets are\nleveraged for organizational growth.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834d4ab5728.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nOne could even say that [employee-\ncentricity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/culture/wednesday-\nwisdom-steven-bianchi-beamery/) forms the cornerstone of this role.\n\nBut are chief people officers across the world ready to take on the\nchallenges, changes, and requirements brought on by [new\nwork](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/new-work-tips-for-hr/)?\nAre they ready to maximize talent and deliver superior employee experiences in\nthe current HR landscape?\n\nLet\u2019s find out.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **2020 HR Predictions: Preparing HR Leaders for the Year\nAhead**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/2020-hr-predictions-\npreparing-hr-leaders-for-the-year-ahead/)\n\n## **The Changing Definition of the Chief People Officer**\n\nThe role of the chief people officer is relatively new, having gained\npopularity in the last decade. With the rise of complex employee expectations,\nand the need to deliver superior experiences geared to retain top talent, this\nrole has begun to gain momentum, often in place of traditional CHROs.\n\nIn 2020, chief people officers can look forward to unprecedented\ntransformations on the road ahead to employee development and growth.\nAccording to a [study](https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en-\nGB/Insights/2020/01/the-future-chief-people-officer-imagine-invent-ignite) of\n500+ executives by Willis Towers Watson in partnership with SHRM Executive\nNetwork, HR People + Strategy, 99% said that chief people officers require the\nagility to evolve in response to employee demands. But only 35% said that\nthese C-level leaders are receiving the preparatory development they will\nneed.\n\nIn this context, it is clear that the role of the chief people officer is\nundergoing a radical transformation. In 2020, these leaders will need to watch\nout for key trends that impact their workforce and realign their strategies\naccordingly. From ensuring employee-centricity, the definition of chief people\nofficer will extend to ensuring employee empowerment in a nuanced fashion.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Training Leaders to Improve Employee, Team and\nOrganizational\nPerformance**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/leadership-\nsuccession/training-leaders-to-improve-employee-team-and-organizational-\nperformance/)\n\n## **5 Trends That Every Chief People Officer Must Watch Out for in 2020**\n\nIf we look at near-term possibilities in HR, several shifts emerge that could\nimpact how chief people officers operate. Specifically, they will have to re-\nenvision their stance in sync with the following five trends:\n\n### **1\\. \u201cPeople\u201d will extend to more than traditional employees**\n\n  \nA lot has been said about how [external\nworkers](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/what-are-\nexternal-workers-and-how-can-you-engage-them-for-better-roi/) (i.e., those\noutside the immediate payroll) will upend HR systems. In 2020, the number of\nexternal workers or \u201cfreelancers\u201d who contribute meaningfully to a company\u2019s\noutput will increase dramatically.\n\nUpwork [survey](https://www.slideshare.net/upwork/freelancing-in-\namerica-2019/1) _ed_ 6,000 U.S. adults in 2019, finding that 35% of the\ncountry\u2019s workforce was engaged in freelancing, and 45% of this comprised\nskilled labor.\n\nIn 2020, chief people officers will have to rewire the [employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience/) from the perspective of external workers as well,\nmaking core elements such as employee benefits, [performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/), and [learning &\ndevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/why-2019-is-the-year-of-learning-and-development-insights-from-\nlinkedins-2019-workplace-learning-report/) easily accessible to those outside\nthe company.\n\n### **2\\. Belongingness in the workplace will assume utmost importance**\n\n  \nA [study by Gettysburg\nCollege](https://www.gettysburg.edu/news/stories?id=79db7b34-630c-4f49-ad32-4ab9ea48e72b&pageTitle=1%2F3+of+your+life+is+spent+at+work)\nfound that we spend close to a third of our lives at work! This makes ensuring\nhappiness and the sense of community that your employees feel at the workplace\ncritical.\n\nA [2018 workplace analysis of Facebook](https://hbr.org/2018/02/people-\nwant-3-things-from-work-but-most-companies-are-built-around-only-one) found\nthat community was among the top three requirements of employees in the\nworkplace. Together with career opportunities and purpose, it forms a\n\u201cpsychological contract\u201d that a modern employee expects from their employer.\n\nChief people officers must recognize this need and address this through\nproactive initiatives, next-gen technologies, and high-level strategies. For\nexample, replacing Slack with email might foster a feeling of candid\ncamaraderie instead of only formal/purposeful communication. A [culture\nanalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-\nculture-analytics-and-how-can-it-help-your-organization/) tool could help\nchief people officers monitor the impact of workplace processes on employee\nsentiment.\n\nRemember, this must also take into account external workers who may not be\npresent on-premise. VR collaboration tools like\n[Vizible](https://www.worldviz.com/virtual-reality-collaboration-software) and\n[MeetinVR](http://meetinvr.net/) might prove useful, as they let workers meet\nvirtually and actually _see_ their colleagues in real-time, regardless of\nlocation. Chief people officers who are mindful of such opportunities and\ninvest accordingly will gain a competitive advantage.\n\n### **3\\. Chief people officers will be the custodians of ethical values**\n\n  \nToday, employees are acutely aware of the ethical nuances governing a\nworkplace. Companies that uphold high standards in terms of diversity &\ninclusion, [gender\nequality](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/diversity/companies-must-\nlead-the-change-for-gender-equality/), and compliance will consistently be\nrated as preferred employers for top talent.\n\nConversely, companies that aren\u2019t aware of these requirements risk damaging\ntheir employer brands. Last year, McDonald\u2019s chief people officer [resigned\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/04/mcdonalds-hr-boss-\nresigns-after-ceos-firing/#4be0c3763f71)from his position after the CEO\nviolated company policy by engaging in a relationship with a company employee.\n\nIn 2020, chief people officers will be viewed as \u201cvalue custodians,\u201d guiding\nemployees toward ethical conduct, compliance, and behavior that augments the\ncompany culture.\n\nThis will require specific learning and development initiatives for chief\npeople officers so they can stay ahead of the curve and strengthen the\npositioning of their employer brand.\n\n### **4\\. Collaboration with chief information, data, and security officers\nwill be key**\n\n  \nIn the last few years, HR has increasingly collaborated with various other\nC-level stakeholders to improve the efficacy of the company\u2019s people function.\nIn 2020, this trend will continue, specifically necessitating collaboration\nwith:\n\n  * **Chief information officers (CIOs)** \\- to power [digital transformation in HR ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-is-hr-digital-transformation/)and foster a technology-enabled workplace\n  * **Chief data officers (CDOs)** \\- to build a shared [people analytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-people-analytics/) function that delivers the requisite insights for [talent management](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-hcm/what-is-talent-management/) and employee experience enhancement, while developing people analytics skills themselves to become sole owners of this function\n  * **Chief security officers (CSOs)** \\- to adhere to the ever-evolving [employee data privacy rights](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/gdpr-ccpa-employeedatarights/) and regulations, maintaining the company\u2019s compliance stance, particularly while managing an ever-growing distributed workforce\n\n### **5\\. Coaching will be central to chief people officers\u2019 continual\ndevelopment**\n\n  \nTo keep up with all these trends, companies will invest in the continual\ndevelopment of chief people officers, primarily through one-on-one targeted\ncoaching.\n\nCoaching is a popular learning methodology among senior leaders (now being\nadopted for [middle\nmanagers](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/executive-coaching-for-middle-managers/) and other ranks as well)\nto hone their leadership skills and capabilities. In fact, \u201cleading teams &\npeople development\u201d was the No. 1 topic covered through internal and external\ncoaching initiatives, as per the [latest\nsurvey](https://www.conferenceboard.ca/e-library/abstract.aspx?did=10248&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1)\nby The Conference Board of Canada.\n\nIn 2020, companies will leverage learning and development technology to\ndeliver coaching sessions at chief people officers\u2019 convenience, with access\nto experienced experts in [people\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-people-management/). This openness to change, growth, and\nupskilling marks a key trend in the chief people officer\u2019s role as we enter a\nnew decade.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Is Your HR Technology Adaptable for the 2020\nWorkforce?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/adaptable-hr-technology/)\n\n## **Over to You**\n\nApart from investing in their own upskilling and future-readiness, chief\npeople officers must also look at instituting a robust [succession\nplan](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/leadership-\nsuccession/technology-is-vital-for-any-succession-planning-strategy/) to be\nable to fill this position with people who are better prepared for the\nuncertainty that defines the future of work.\n\nFilling in key positions such as this one can be challenging \u2013 not only\nbecause the labor market is tight but also because it is a new role, and more\nyounger individuals are going to be expected to fill it. In such cases, an\norganization\u2019s succession plan needs to be concrete, and employee development\nfor leadership roles must begin early on.\n\nEven as senior leaders adapt to changing workforce dynamics, they will be\ncompelled to maintain a keen focus on the next generation of HR talent and\nhone internal capabilities for seamless succession on the way forward.\n\nIt will be imperative for chief people officers to always stay a step ahead of\nthe trends and ensure that they are prepared for them when the time arises.\nForesight, vision, and agility are the three traits any chief people officer\nneeds to succeed and be prepared for the future of work.\n\n_Do you have a succession plan in place for your chief people officer?

As such, it continues to\ntranscend all industries all over the world.  Why?  First and foremost, people\nare a company's greatest asset.  In the same vein, a company's value is\nperpetually linked to the success of its people.\n\nAdditionally, study after study shows companies offering growth and\ndevelopment opportunities translates to high success in recruitment and\nretention.  Talent management itself is a commitment from an organization to\nrecruit, hire, retain, and develop employees.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the HR Exchange Network will put a focus on [talent\nmanagement](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/articles/talent-management-guide) by explaining each tenement and\nthe inherent challenges that accompany them in a series of articles.  These\ntenements are often referred to as the pillars of talent management.\n\n# Pillars of Talent Management Explained\n\nTo better understand each pillar, a description of each is below.\n\n  * [Recruitment](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-acquisition/articles/recruitment-talent-management-pillars-part-i) - In order for a talent management strategy to exist, there must first be talent. Recruitment is Step 1 in creating the strategy.  Here, companies and organizations work to attract talented people who can be converted in to employees.\n  * [Learning and Development](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/learning/articles/learning-and-development-talent-management-pillars-part-ii) - This pillar includes everything from ongoing training to learning during the employee lifecycle. It allows for workers to fine-tune and further develop the critical skills needed to meet their performance goals and to help the company complete its strategic goals.\n  * Performance Management - Once hired, talent is expected to perform at a high standard. This process includes the way in which HR measures and improves performance.  Common procedures include performance reviews, one-on-one meetings, and reward and recognition programs.\n  * [Retention](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-management/articles/retention-talent-management-pillars-part-iv) - As defined, retention is about keeping high performing talent with the company or organization as long as possible. This leads to increased productivity and successful completion of strategic goals.\n\n# Performance Management\n\nWhen thinking about performance management, what comes to mind?  For many it\nis performance reviews.  The reality is human resources needs to outgrow this\nidea.  Real performance management eliminates the need for such things.\n\nPerformance management is almost like retention.  Once an employee starts\nemployment, performance management also begins.  The process happens\nthroughout the employee lifecycle and gives leaders an opportunity to create\nadvancement.  Note:  that advancement doesn't always include promotions or\nmoves, but can include skills or knowledge advancement.\n\nA good performance management strategy includes:\n\n  * Clear job descriptions\n  * New employee orientation\n  * Performance Standards\n  * Ongoing learning and development\n  * Performance planning\n  * Rewards\n  * Potential for promotions and/or lateral moves\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion Dimensions\n\nAnother thing to consider as part of the organization's performance management\nstrategy is [diversity and inclusion](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-\ntalent-management/articles/what-diversity-looks-like-in-the-workplace).  It's\nnot always at the forefront of a manager's mind when doing performance\nappraisals.  Banner Health's director of diversity and inclusion and HR\nExchange Network advisory board member Jackie Hunter says it should be part of\nthe process.\n\nIn fact, Hunter spoke at length about the topic during HR Exchange Network's\nfree-to-attend online event [Talent Exchange\nLive](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/online-events/talent-\nmanagement?mac=HRIQ_OnlineEvents_Image_Listing).\n\nShe said HR and leaders must know their employees and their teams on multiple\nlevels of diversity, i.e. multigenerational and cultural.  Embracing this\ninformation leads to high performing individuals.  Companies who are more\ngender diverse are 15 percent more likely to outperform those companies that\naren't.  Those companies that are more ethnically diverse are 35 percent more\nlikely to outperform those that aren't.\n\n## In summation\n\nAll of this once achieved helps drive a key component of successful\nbusinesses:  strong employee engagement.  That, in turn, continues to drive\nperformance.  It's a cycle that all companies and organizations need to\nunderstand and development.  Understanding this cycle and using it correctly\nwill help ensure that business needs are being met.  Performance management\nwill always be a part of the overall talent management strategy for this\nreason.\n\n> Find out everything there is to know about employee engagement\n> [here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\n> engagement/articles/employee-engagement-everything-you-need-to-know).\n\n\n\n**_Want more content faster?

The major concern is that it may also eventually lead to\nmassive job cuts to lessen the financial burden. Praveen Khandelwal,\nSecretary-General of CAIT shared with ET, \u201cWe have asked the government to\nprovide support on the salary component to the tune of 50 percent. Rest 25\npercent will be taken care of by the employer and another 25 percent by the\nemployee.\u201d\n\nWith the business shut down because of the lockdown, retailers are now\nconcerned about managing costs. \"Once the situation normalises, the traders\nwill have multiple challenges such as commercial rent, statutory payment and\nbusiness revival which would further make the traders financial condition\nworse,\" Khandelwal added.\n\nIn the letter addressed to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and dated April\n2, CAIT has mentioned that a strong stimulus package is needed for the small\nbusinesses who are the contributors of a major chunk of revenue to the\ngovernment and are also the backbone of the Indian economy.\n\nIn recent years, small businesses were indeed given a lot of focus and\nidentified as a source of creating more job opportunities as well. However,\nthe current crisis looming over the country due to COVID-19 has put all of\nthese jobs in question now. Businesses will be in a dilemma whether to focus\non maintaining cash flow or keep the employees financial well-being in mind.\nHow do they find the balance?\n\nHere's an intersesting read on: [Keeping cost in check and employees on the\npayroll amid COVID-19](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/strategic-\nhr/keeping-cost-in-check-and-employees-on-the-payroll-amid-covid-19-25179\n\"People Matters India\")\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Compensation & Benefits](/category/compensation-\nperformance/compensation-\nbenefits?utm_source=post_news&utm_content=compensation-benefits \"Browse more\nin: Compensation &amp; Benefits\"),\n[#COVID-19](/tag/covid-19?utm_source=post_news&utm_content=covid-19 \"Browse\nmore in: COVID-19\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Drishti Pant](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1514013807/authors/drishti-\npant.jpg)](/author/drishti-pant)\n\n#### [Drishti Pant](/author/drishti-pant)\n\nDrishti Pant is Senior Associate - Content with People Matters.

Aliogo\n\nAs Nigeria\u2019s coronavirus lockdown continues to take a toll on organisations,\nespecially Small Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs), the Managing Partner at HR-\nEX Consulting, Enitan Oyenuga, has advised organisations and businesses to put\nmeasures in place to manage cost.\n\nOyenuga, who disclosed to THISDAY in a statement said people cost is one of\nthe biggest expenses on the income statement of any business and depending on\nthe business size, can account for up to 70% of overall business cost.\n\nShe stated that cost on the part of small businesses is likely to cause a\nswift and unexpected shift in the economy especially with the current\nsituation of the country due to the corona virus pandemic, thereby leading to\nrapid depletion in cash and bankruptcy.\n\nShe maintained that working with a group of small business, it was discovered\nthat there are actions small businesses are taking to minimise the impact of\nthese changes and safeguard the future of their businesses, \u201cI do hope these\nideas will help you land on a solution that works for your own business.\u201d\n\nOyenuga further explained that in the light of the national lockdown to combat\nthe spread of COVID-19, a number of companies are responding with pay cuts.\n\nShe remarked that with large cuts at leadership levels and graduated\npercentage reduction below the management team; it has been observed that\nleadership, \u201cin some of the worse hit sectors completely foregoing their\nsalary, implementing up to 50% pay cuts for management level employees and\n30-25% for the rest of the organisation.\u201d\n\nShe affirmed that in implementing a salary cut, an organisation must ensure no\none is paid below the minimum wage, communicate a timeframe for the pay\nreduction, exempt low-wage employees, get the employees\u2019 consent prior to\neffecting the change and others.\n\nOyenuga, who highlighted the place of unpaid leave (furlough) in\norganisations, said it is an employer-mandate temporary unpaid leave from\nwork.\n\nShe argued that mandatory unpaid leave could last a few weeks or months,\nadding that this is usually a preferred option to layoffs as it allows\nemployers very easily reduce people costs without adding on new costs and\nsafeguard knowledge accumulated about the business and industry.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cIn addition, with replacement cost valued at about 33% of\nannual salary for the role, unpaid leave means a savings in recruitment and\nonboarding costs when business as usual resumes, allowing for employees to\neasily pick up from where they left off. If you decide on mandatory unpaid\nleave, consider how to figure out your critical staffing for the period. You\nmay want to consider the work that is required, work schedule or rosters,\nexisting performance data performance and skills required during this period.\nEngage them on the need to cover the reduced workload. Engage and inform all\nemployees on the change (the alternative being employee layoffs). Communicate\na timeframe for the unpaid leave period. Get the employee\u2019s consent prior to\neffecting the change. If the situation is likely to continue after the set\nperiod, inform well in advance.\u201d\n\n### Share this:\n\n  *

We look at this\nand other key trends for 2020, with insights from Gartner, Mercer, Gallup,\nBetterWorks, and HBR._**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834b324a1a1.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nPerformance management is integral to internal talent development and\nmobility, making the most of your existing workforce. Intelligent performance\nmanagement can help you [close the skills\ngap](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\nemployers-can-close-skills-gap/), reduce external hiring, and drive\nproductivity like never before.\n\nHowever, performance management is a rapidly changing space \u2013 we\u2019ve previously\ndiscussed how it\u2019s one of the [top five _HR_ trends that witnessed a massive\nchange in the last decade.](http://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/2010-vs-2020-hr-trends/)\n\nUnderstandably, it can be difficult to continuously align your strategies and\ntoolkits to keep up with the latest performance management trends. That\u2019s why\nwe turned to leading analysts to bring you five of these trends for 2020.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **3 Steps to Update Your Performance Management\nProcess**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/3-steps-to-update-your-performance-management-process/)\n\n## **5 Trends That Will Performance Management in 2020**\n\n[Performance management](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/what-is-performance-management/) is now based on community\nfeedback from an employee\u2019s peers and regular dialogue with the employee to\nobtain an accurate picture of their performance. This is possible through\ncutting-edge performance management tools meant for agile goal-setting and\n[continuous\nfeedback](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/culture/building-a-\nculture-of-feedback-in-conversation-with-didier-elzinga-culture-amp/).\n\nSo, what does the performance management space have in store for HR\nprofessionals this year? Here are five important trends from Gartner, Mercer,\nGallup, BetterWorks, and Harvard Business Review (HBR).\n\n### **1\\. Companies will prioritize the quality and impact of performance\nmanagement processes over efficiency**\n\n  \n_According to Gartner, 67% of organizations aim to reduce the time and effort\nspent on performance management._\n\nIn a [survey of 9,438 people](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-\nresources/trends/why-performance-management-is-failing) (work email needed),\nGartner found that 82% of HR leaders agree about the ineffective nature of\nexisting performance practices. Most leaders focus on reducing time and effort\non performance management, but this largely counterproductive.\n\nGartner found that prioritizing effort reduction can bring down workforce\nperformance by 16.6%!\n\nIn 2020, a key trend will be to prioritize performance management so that it\nis an employee-centric experience. Companies will adopt software that offers\nan engaging experience for both managers and employees, generating feedback\nthat is most relevant to work and adds genuine value to employee performance\nand productivity.\n\n### **2\\. Performance management software will be integrated with other talent\ndecision-making tools**\n\n  \n_According to Mercer, 70% of companies want to strengthen the link between\nperformance management and other talent decisions._\n\nMercer\u2019s 2019 [survey of 1,154 HR leaders](https://www.mercer.com/our-\nthinking/career/performance-transformation-in-the-future-of-work.html) (email\nneeded) highlighted the need to link performance management and talent\ndecisions more closely. Like Gartner\u2019s prediction, the survey questions the\nvalue-generating capabilities of existing processes. In fact, only 2% of\ncompanies feel that their performance management approach is geared for value.\n\nTo address this, performance management software will have to become part of a\ncentralized [talent\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-talent-management/) system, where a single source of employee data\ninforms every talent decision. Feedback, learning & development, career\nprogression, succession planning, and even\n[recruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-recruitment/) could form a part of this new talent\n\u201cecosystem.\u201d\n\n### **3\\. Coaching feedback, as opposed to critical feedback, will be\ninstrumental in 2020**\n\n  \n_According to Gallup\u2019s analytics and the company\u2019s work with Stanford\nUniversity, current approaches to feedback lower performance approximately\none-third of the time._\n\n[Gallup\u2019s internal analytics\nrevealed](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/249332/harm-good-truth-performance-\nreviews.aspx) that only 14% of employees strongly agree that they are inspired\nby typical performance reviews. In contrast, a weekly system where managers\nregularly coach employees is far more effective. In a weekly feedback system,\nemployees are 2.7X more likely to be engaged and 3.2X more likely to be\nmotivated.\n\nThe annual system suffers from two shortcomings. The feedback has probably\nbecome irrelevant by the time the employee receives it. Also, it not\nactionable in the short term, making employees feel frustrated. Gallup\u2019s\nmetrics turn the spotlight on the need for strength-based performance\nmanagement (popularized by [executive\ncoaching](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/executive-coaching-for-middle-managers/)), rather than critical\nfeedback shared once a year. And this brings us to the next performance\nmanagement trend for 2020.\n\n### **4\\. \u201cContinuous\u201d will be the new normal, calling for agile performance\nmanagement systems**\n\n  \n_According to BetterWorks, companies that switched to continuous performance\nmanagement outperform their competitors by 24% \u2013_[agile\nsystems](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/agile-performance-management-software/) _are critical to this\ntransformation._\n\n66% of companies who leverage continuous performance management are able to\nboost productivity all year long, compared to just 35% of those who don\u2019t. In\nfact, [BetterWorks\u2019 survey](https://blog.betterworks.com/betterworks-released-\nthe-first-report-based-on-insights-from-our-2019-2020-state-of-continuous-\nperformance-management-survey-this-report-focused-on-quantifying-the-business-\nimpact-of-a-continuous-per/) of 500 respondents revealed that a continuous\nmodel helps companies perform better in several areas, including enterprise\nagility (47% vs. 27%), workforce engagement (58% vs. 37%), retention (63% vs.\n41%).\n\nThe survey confirms a growing trend in HR: embracing a less formalized and\nmore agile approach to performance management, where you can dynamically set\ngoals, source feedback, and improve productivity. Platforms that can analyze\ndata in real-time and depict changing performance trends accurately will be in\nhigh demand this year.\n\n### **5\\. 2020 will bring new synergies between employee engagement and\nperformance management**\n\n  \n_According to the Harvard Business Review, over 90% of business leaders agree\nthat engaged employees perform better._\n\nHarvard Business Review Analytic Services\n[surveyed](https://www.glintinc.com/resource/peak-performance-how-combining-\nemployee-engagement-and-performance-management-fuels-organizational-success/)\n717 business leaders (email needed) to find out the key drivers of\nperformance. Over 90% said that [employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/) was critical, but only 26% were confident that their\ncompanies had high levels of employee engagement. 2020 is the year to address\nthis, with better integration between HR systems.\n\nGoing back to trend no. 2 (from Mercer), it\u2019s clear that the interoperability\nof performance management tools will be a key priority. Currently, only 16%\nenjoy both high-performance and high engagement, indicating a lot of room for\nimprovement for \u201claggard\u201d companies as per Harvard Business Review.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is HRIS? System, Model and\nApplication](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)**\n\n## **Make 2020 the Year of Employee-Centric Performance Management Practices**\n\nPerformance management has been an HR staple for a while now, but existing\nmodels require an end-to-end overhaul. The traditional, annual-appraisal\nstructure is far from being employee-centric. Your workforce receives feedback\nlong after the actual activity, and they cannot meaningfully collaborate with\nmanagers to improve performance.\n\nThat\u2019s why companies should take inspiration from Gartner, Mercer, Gallup,\nBetterWorks, and HBR\u2019s insights and consider the following:\n\n  * Link systems to the larger [talent management](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-hcm/what-is-talent-management/) fabric for outcome-focused decisions\n  * Embrace continuous performance management and feedback using agile systems\n  * Ensure employee engagement features like rewards, recognition, and two-way communication are available on your performance management software\n  * Use learning and development (L&D;) to plug performance gaps through the year, without waiting for appraisal season\n\n  \nInterestingly, all of these performance management trends share a common\nelement: they highlight gaps in existing performance strategies and tools.\n\nFortunately, the data is already there, flowing in from multiple disparate\nsources, be it talent management, employee engagement, or L&D; platforms. 2020\nwill be all about consolidating them to formulate an effective performance\nmanagement strategy.\n\n_Which trend do you think will revolutionize performance management in 2020?\nTell us on_[ _Facebook_](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist/) _,_[\n_LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-technologist/) _, or_[\n_Twitter_](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist?lang=en?) _.

This outside\nthe box experience rewards employees for their hard work with a relaxing but\n[productive](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/how-to-\nfight-the-productivity-epidemic/) retreat. Getting out of the office as a team\ncan inspire creativity, build stronger bonds, and provide direction for the\nremainder of the quarter.\n\n[Planning a successful retreat](https://www.fundera.com/blog/how-to-plan-a-\ncompany-retreat) isn\u2019t rocket science, but it does take some critical thinking\nand pre-booking to get the most out of the event. Follow the seven steps below\nfor an essential roadmap to planning the best retreat for your company.\n\n## **1\\. Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**\n\nIt will be challenging to get buy-in from upper management without defining\nwhat constitutes a successful retreat. Bonus points if you can tie the results\ndirectly to revenue.\n\n  * **Morale Boost:** measure the turnover rate before and after the event, or even employee satisfaction with an anonymous survey.\n  * **Team Building:** breakdown barriers between departments, and have each explain their job in their own words to create inter-department bonds.\n  * **Marketing Materials:** take professional photos throughout the event to host on your social media pages or website for prospective employees to understand the [company culture.](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/how-to-create-a-culture-of-growth-career-development-within-your-firm/)\n\n##  \n**2\\. Schedule the Event**\n\nConsider employee schedules. If your company is an accounting firm, April and\nmonths leading up to it would be a detrimental time to schedule the retreat.\nUse the event as an annual celebration to complement the employee work ethic\nafter the conclusion of a significant busy season.\n\n**Learn More:[4 Ways Employee Engagement Can Solve Productivity\nProblem](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/4-ways-\nemployee-engagement-can-solve-productivity-problem/)**\n\n## **3\\. Confirm Attendance**\n\nThe most successful retreats are the ones where there\u2019s buy-in from\nleadership. Confirm C-level executives will be in attendance to eliminate\nhierarchy during the event. Go one step further and have leaders come up with\nice breaker exercises or themed days throughout the retreat.\n\n## **4\\. Book the Location & Transportation**\n\nLocation, location, location. Think about the proximity of the office to the\nlocation of the event. If there will be any alcohol served, make sure\ntransportation is booked to and from the event. Some modes of transportation\nto consider include:\n\n  * **Taxis**\n  * **Busses**\n  * **Limos**\n  * **Airplanes**\n\n##  \n**5\\. Negotiate Pricing**\n\nBecause you\u2019re looking for such a large group, confirm any group discounts\nbefore charging the [company card](https://www.fundera.com/business-credit-\ncards/paypal-business-credit-card). Frequently, because you\u2019re bringing the\ntransportation company and the event space so much business, there are\ndiscounts to be had.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Increase Employee Engagement through Modern\nITSM](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-to-\nincrease-employee-engagement-through-modern-itsm/)**\n\n## **6\\. Plan Events**\n\nDon\u2019t forget to plan the actual events during the retreat! These can be simple\nicebreakers or formal networking events. Think about your KPIs during this\nstage, as different activities will have more effects on the overall goal than\nothers.\n\n## **7\\. Revisit the Original KPIs**\n\nAfter the retreat is over and done with, revisit the goals set before going on\nthe resort. This is an excellent chance to elicit feedback. Understanding what\nwent well and didn\u2019t will be crucial to planning better and better retreats\nwith each passing year.\n\nWhen pitching this event to upper management, focus on the KPIs, especially\nanything that will affect the bottom line.

Organisations can enable effective\nemployee ownership of performance management design by reframing the roles of\ndifferent stakeholders in the process:\n\n  * HR should shift from owners to consultants, providing expertise in talent management and project facilitation.\n  * Employees should not be treated as consumers of the process, but as designers of performance management from ideation through rollout.\n  * Senior leadership should become enablers who actively embrace performance management as an employee-led initiative and provide visible support without biasing the design.\n\n**Adapting performance management to collaborative work**  \nEfforts to use performance management to improve the effectiveness of\ncollaboration typically fail as employees don't see a clear individual benefit\nto effective collaboration and/or they don't understand what specific actions\nthey need to take to collaborate effectively.\n\nOrganisations can overcome these barriers by appealing to employees' own self-\ninterest, first by showing employees that collaboration is a tool they can use\nto achieve their individual goals.\n\nMoreover, leaders should communicate which actions, not just attributes,\nemployees must demonstrate to collaborate effectively.\n\nFinally, HR should ensure the performance management process helps employees\nidentify specific individuals they must collaborate with and recognises\nemployees for effective collaboration.\n\n\"Employees were four times more likely to say performance management was worth\nthe time and effort required when they judged its utility to be high rather\nthan low,\" said Prime.\n\n\"When employees can see the value of performance management, they're willing\nto put in the work regardless of how much is required.\"\n\n### Related stories\n\n  * [Performance management: How to do it right](/asia/specialisation/employee-engagement/performance-management-how-to-do-it-right/153301)\n  * [HR's three

What was once an annual process is now transitioning to\ncontinuous performance management. The goal is to ensure that employees are\nperforming efficiently throughout the year, and in the process, address any\nissues that may arise along the way that affect employee performance.\n\n\"Most workers perceive their organization's performance management approach as\nconfusing, subjective, and infrequent,\" said [Kathi\nEnderes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathienderes/) (vice president, Talent,\nand Workforce Research Leader) and [Matthew\nShannon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shannomsha/) (senior research analyst) at\nBersin, Deloitte Consulting LLP, in an exclusive with HR Technologist.\n\nThis is the current state of performance management. However, it doesn't have\nto be that way. Automation now plays a significant role in performance\nmanagement, and many of the processes involved can be streamlined so that\nemployee performance can be strategically managed. This is the age of\n[**continuous performance\nmanagement**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-continuous-performance-management-and-4-reasons-you-need-it/), and\nhere\u2019s everything you need to know about it.\n\nPerformance management differs from [**talent\nmanagement**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-talent-management/) in that the latter is a set of initiatives\ntaken to engage employees to retain them. Performance management, on the other\nhand, is an initiative that guides employees towards establishing and\nachieving their goals in alignment with the organization's immediate and\noverarching goals.\n\n### **Why is performance management important?**\n\n  \n**1.** **Performance management supplements the annual**[ **performance\nreview**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/the-absurdity-of-the-annual-performance-review/) ** _._** This prepares\nboth employees and managers about what to expect during the annual appraisal.\nIt keeps both the manager and the employee in the loop about ongoing changes\nto the performance management process, what both can do to streamline it, and\nhow performance overall can be improved.\n\n**2\\. To employees, continuous performance management indicates that managers\nvalue them**. Employees believe that their managers are interested in their\nwork and care about their goals and any issues they may face in the course of\ntheir job. They also become more open to receiving constructive feedback.\n\n## **The Performance Management Cycle**\n\nThe performance management process or cycle is a series of five key steps.\nThese steps are imperative, regardless of how often you review employee\nperformance.\n\n### **1\\. Planning**\n\n  \nThis stage entails setting employees' goals and communicating these goals with\nthem. While these goals should be disclosed in the job description to attract\nquality candidates, they should be communicated once again when the candidate\nbecomes a new hire. Depending on the performance management process in your\norganization, you may want to assign a percentage to each of these goals to be\nable to evaluate their achievement.\n\n### **2\\. Monitoring**\n\n  \nIn this phase, managers are required to monitor the employees\u2019 performance on\nthe goal. This is where continuous performance management comes into the\npicture. With the right performance management software, you can track your\nteam\u2019s performance in real-time and modify and correct course whenever\nrequired.\n\n### **3\\. Developing**\n\n  \nThis phase includes using the data obtained during the monitoring phase to\nimprove the performance of employees. It may require suggesting refresher\ncourses, providing an assignment that helps them improve their knowledge and\nperformance on the job, or altering the course of employee development to\nenhance performance or sustain excellence.\n\n### **4\\. Rating**\n\n  \nEach employee\u2019s performance must be rated periodically and then at the time of\nthe performance appraisal. Ratings are essential to identify the state of\nemployee performance and implement changes accordingly. Both peers and\nmanagers can provide these ratings for 360-degree feedback.\n\n### **5\\. Rewarding**\n\n  \nRecognizing and rewarding good performance is essential to the performance\nmanagement process, as well as an important part of [employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/). You can do this with a simple thank you, social\nrecognition, or a full-scale employee rewards program that regularly\nrecognizes and rewards excellent performance in the organization.\n\n## **How to Improve the Performance Management Process**\n\nTo improve the performance management process, ask the following questions:\n\n### **1\\. What does your workforce want from performance management?**\n\n  \nA performance management program can either help or hinder your workforce.\nHowever, before you can make any practical changes to your current processes\nand tools, you need to understand what isn\u2019t working and why. You also need to\ntake the time to evaluate what your employees want out of a performance\nmanagement program.\n\nDuring this evaluation, there's nothing more important than talking to your\npeople. Your employees and managers likely have some strong opinions that\nthey'll be more than happy to share with you. You might be surprised how many\nof them crave an improved process.\n\nThe next step is to convey your findings to decision-makers who can sponsor\nand drive change in your organization. Share your internal findings as well as\nevidence-based research from experts that show the impact that an improved\nperformance process can have on business results.\n\n**Learn more:**[ **3 Effective Ways to Create a Non-Toxic High-Performance\nCulture at Work**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/how-to-create-nontoxic-high-performance-\nculture/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=4954&zd_term=jameswrighton)\n\n### **2\\. Do you deliver continuous performance management?**\n\n  \nEmployers want their employees to be happy. But happiness isn\u2019t necessarily\nwhat people want from their employers. Instead, employees want to feel\nmotivated and understand that their work matters and why. A performance\nmanagement experience that delivers value to employees should focus on\nincreasing motivation.\n\nTo drive motivation, a performance management process must include frequent,\nongoing conversations between employees and managers so that goals, progress,\nand personal achievement remain relevant and top-of-mind.\n\nThe content of these conversations is just as relevant as their frequency.\nMotivation is tied to a future-focused outlook focused on developmental\nopportunities. Managers must authentically engage with employees about their\ncareer success, goal achievement, and alignment of their work to the\norganization's top priorities.\n\nTo be successful, these frequent conversations should be \u201clightweight\u201d and\ninclude future-oriented questions for employees such as: What motivates you?\nWhat's helping you? What do you need? And HR can support this by coaching\nmanagers in giving more productive, proactive feedback, as well as asking the\nright questions.\n\n### **3\\. Do managers have the tools to manage the performance management\nprocess?**\n\n  \nManagers are critical to the success of your organization's performance\nmanagement program. They play an outsized role in motivating, engaging, and\ndeveloping staff. This makes it essential to ensure managers are trained to\ngive and receive useful feedback and are coached in the elements of a\ncontinuous process.\n\nTake time to meet with managers and train them on your talent management\npractices so that everyone feels comfortable having frequent, lightweight\nconversations.\n\nFinally, having the right technology in place to support continuous\nperformance management is essential. You need HR technology explicitly\ndesigned to help managers and the organization in a continuous process.\n\n## **The Era of Automated Performance Management**\n\nPerformance management is not just a matter for HR. It is the concern of all\nleadership levels in an organization. However, \u201cOrganizations are often left\nwondering if investments in technology will actually lead to improvements,\u201d\nsays [Deloitte\u2019s Performance management Solutions: Market\nPrimer](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/human-\ncapital/us-human-capital-bersin-lt-vendor-landscape-pm-primer-07-2019.pdf).\n\n### **Should you invest in performance management software?**\n\nInvestments in technology will lead to improvements only when there is a\nspecific performance management strategy in place. Without one, an automated\nsolution can only overburden a manager.\n\nEnderes and Shannon believe that: \"When no strategic vision is in place, an\norganization might fall back on merely automating existing processes, missing\nout on the transformational power of technology. This typically results in a\nlack of adoption by the workforce and leadership, which in turn will result in\na lack of business outcomes.\u201d\n\nEvery employee (including top leadership) is a stakeholder who will benefit\nfrom the organization-wide implementation of an automated performance\nmanagement system. However, they must be aware of the goals they aim to\nachieve through performance management. [**Performance management\ndata**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/the-best-way-to-improve-performance-management-data-is-to-use-it/) can\noffer unique insights that no amount of manual tracking or surveys can offer.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to what features an ideal performance management software (PMS)\nshould contain.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is HRIS? System, Model and\nApplication**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)\n\n### Key features of effective performance management software\n\nAny software should be chosen with the following considerations in mind:\n\n  * **Customization:** It should be customizable to suit your organization\u2019s industry and performance management strategy.\n  * **Transparency:** It should be able to eliminate the confusion that both managers and their teams experience in the process of performance management.\n  * **Objectivity:** It should be able to offer objective metrics on which managers can base their performance evaluation.\n  * **Frequency:** It should allow for real-time, instant feedback and periodic employee ratings.\n\n  \nBased on these considerations, the ideal [**performance management\ntool**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/4-performance-management-tools-that-every-smb-should-know-about/) will\nhave at least the following features:\n\n![The 10 key features of performance management software](/images/ajax-\nloader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. The 10 key features of performance management software**\n\n**1\\. Dynamic goal-setting:** The employees\u2019 goals should be aligned with the\norganization\u2019s goals. The solution should allow the option to change the goal\nas and when needed.\n\n**2\\. Communication on the fly:** A good performance management solution\nprovides interaction between team members and managers effortlessly at any\ntime with an in-built chat feature. A quick chat with team members or managers\ncan keep communication transparent and effortless.\n\n**3\\. Scheduling tools:** It should allow scheduling for team members to\ncomplete tasks, plan meetings, and collaborate with other team members. This\nworks as an excellent tool for employees who work out on the field or\nremotely.\n\n**4\\. Continuous performance evaluation:** Managers should be able to set up\nautomated self-assessment and general evaluation questionnaires delivered in\nthe flow of work through the PMS. This gives managers a clear view of how\nemployees perceive their performance on the job and whether they are on track\nto achieve their and the organization\u2019s goals.\n\n**5\\. Recognition tool** : The PMS should have a platform where managers can\nshout out to their team members for doing well. Further integration with an\nemail to give direct, instant feedback is another great feature that can\nmotivate employees and enable positive employee engagement.\n\n**6\\. 360-degree feedback:** Feedback from multiple sources or 360-degree\nfeedback is essential for effective performance management. It significantly\nreduces the bias that can arise from the evaluation of an employee by just one\nperson. The tool should be able to offer the option of feedback collection\nfrom team members, reporting managers, reports, and peers from other teams.\n\n**7\\. Project performance tracking tools** : It should offer tools such as\ntimesheets that help track how employees use their time, and whether their\ninput matches the expected output and outcome.\n\nArtificial intelligence-powered tools use features such as advanced natural\nlanguage processing, which track project-related keywords through email and\nother communication to gauge progress on a project. These tools can enable\nmore objective performance evaluations.\n\n**8\\. Performance comparison:** Managers should be able to track the\nperformance of all employees in their team or those assigned to a specific\nproject. The tool should go further and be able to generate a performance\nreport automatically, providing data on the metrics you have customized it to\nevaluate.\n\n**9\\. Automated reminders and notifications:** A gentle nudge to\nemployees/managers to remind them of deadlines, notifications that indicate\nprogress on a particular project, and general updates to changes in the\nprocess can improve an employee\u2019s experience with performance management.\n\n**10\\. Data security:** This level of granular data about individual employees\nshould be safeguarded with a robust firewall in place. Always ensure that any\ntool you shortlist offers a robust data security and protection feature.\n\nWhat\u2019s critical in the implementation of a performance management system is\nthat both managers and employees are trained to use the system for maximum\nefficiency. Choose a PMS from a vendor who offers ongoing support and helps\nboth managers and their team members use the software optimally.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Human Capital Management (HCM)? Definition, Process\nand Strategy**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/what-is-human-capital-management/)\n\n## **Which Performance Management Processes Cannot Be Automated?**\n\nPerformance management is a people-oriented process. A technological\nperformance management solution cannot have the sometimes-necessary difficult\nconversations for managers. That is the one thing that managers need to take\nownership of.\n\nWhile feedback conversations are often difficult, when supplemented with\nobjective data supplied by performance management systems, they can turn into\nhonest discussions and coaching sessions. This data can also help eliminate\nimplicit bias, so employees know that they are being assessed objectively.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **5 Ways to Improve Your Performance Management\nSystem**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/5-ways-to-improve-your-performance-management-system/)\n\n## **Performance Management Best Practices**\n\nThe only way to ensure the success of performance management is to treat it\nlike a continuously evolving, fluid process by three best practices.\n\n![Best Practices for Effective Performance Management](/images/ajax-\nloader.png)\n\n**Fig 2. Best Practices for Effective Performance Management**\n\n### **1\\. A well-designed performance management strategy**\n\n  \nSome of the key questions that a well-designed performance management plan\nwill answer are:\n\n  * How often will employee performance be evaluated \u2013 weekly, monthly, or quarterly?\n  * What systems are in place for this evaluation \u2013 sentiment analysis trackers, automated pulse surveys, one-on-one meetings?\n  * What approach will a feedback conversation follow?\n  * What will the post-feedback approach and evaluation system be?\n\n  \nTo this, Enderes and Shannon add, \u201cSmall bite-sized feedback that is provided\nby the people closest to the work, in the flow of work, and with actionable\ninput helps make steady improvements and enables learning in the flow of\nwork.\u201d\n\nThis again is made possible by using an automated performance management tool\nthat allows you to set goals, modify them, and communicate changes on the go.\nNo unnecessary meetings are required, and employees can modify their work plan\nand strategy as per the goals you assign.\n\n### **2\\. A culture of open and effective communication**\n\n  \nContinuous monitoring can help initiate conversations about employee issues. A\nnegative sentiment or the poor performance of an employee can be addressed\nonly when communication is open and transparent in an organization.\n\nA culture of communication is an organization-wide responsibility, starting\nfrom top leadership and trickling down to all departments. Managers will adopt\nthis culture and deliver honest feedback to employees, allow employees to be\nhonest, and use that information to help them.\n\nA culture of communication is also developed by hiring people managers who are\nskilled in delivering both positive and constructive feedback \u2013 managers who\nmotivate employees but also hold them accountable for their work.\n\nTransparent communication also includes:\n\n  * Sharing with the employee exactly what is expected of them.\n  * Coaching employees to reach their maximum potential through actionable goals.\n  * Giving them actionable, not generic, feedback.\n  * Revealing the rewards in place for successful goal achievement.\n\n###  \n**3\\. Continuous monitoring**\n\n  \nThis may sound more like a \u201cBig Brother\u201d form of monitoring an employee\u2019s\nevery move and action, but that is the exact opposite of efficient performance\nmanagement.\n\nIn the HR context, this involves tracking employees' progress in real-time and\nmonitoring the output and outcomes an employee delivers. Also, by keeping an\neye on employee sentiment, through observation, interactions, as well as with\nthe help of [sentiment analysis\ntools](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/sentiment-\nanalytics-tools-features-price/), managers can assess the general mood of\ntheir teams. This allows them to address the specific problem at hand as soon\nas a problem occurs.\n\nWith the tech tools available, as discussed in detail later, continuous\nmonitoring at a granular level is now a much easier task. And with the\nobjective data an automated performance management software can reveal, it is\neasier to start conversations with employees.\n\nTo enable all these elements of a successful performance management strategy,\nthere is a host of automated performance management systems to choose from.\nThese solutions can simplify several operations that traditionally relied on\nmanual processes as well as monitoring and feedback delivery.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is People Management? Complete Process with Best\nPractices**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-people-management/)\n\n### **What Is the Future of Performance Management?**\n\n  \n\u201cAs a practice, performance management is converging with learning, engagement\nand career management,\u201d reveal Enderes and Shannon.\n\n**1\\. Annual performance management is going out of style**\n\nInterestingly, as the concept of performance management evolves, so do the\npractices associated with it. For instance, several organizations such as\nNetflix have entirely abandoned annual performance management practices for\nwhat they call fluid performance management, a more agile, continuous approach\nto managing performance.\n\n**2\\. One-on-one feedback is gaining importance**\n\nIt must be emphasized that the replacement of annual for fluid performance\nmanagement does not eliminate the need for one-on-one feedback. In fact, it\nreinforces the importance of regular feedback to ensure that employees\u2019 work\nis aligned with the organization\u2019s objective. And if necessary, managers can\ncoach their employees and tweak the workflow to facilitate the achievement of\ngoals.\n\n**3\\. Performance management tech is becoming more mainstream**\n\n\u201cFrom a technology perspective, we expect smart machines, cognitive and\nartificial intelligence to become more prevalent \u2013 including capabilities that\ncan actively recommend performance actions and engagement suggestions to\nbetter meet individual goals. We also foresee a much more advanced use of\ncapabilities that offer a user experience that is seamless \u2013 rather than\ndisparate systems \u2013 building performance activities into the systems where\nwork actually happens,\u201d say Enderes and Shannon.\n\nWith these insights, the key takeaway for HR teams is clear. The alignment of\nan effective performance management system with managers who have the people\nskills to deliver feedback regularly can result in a highly motivated\nworkforce, not to mention, translate into improved business outcomes.\n\n_Do you use performance management tools to track performance in your\norganization?

And organizations will\nalways need a way to facilitate how work is assigned, undertaken, managed and\nreviewed.\n\n\n\nIn addition, many organizations want a system for managing how employees are\ncompensated, developed, and deployed. And a performance management process\ntypically provides key inputs to be considered when making decisions on pay,\ntraining, and promotions.\n\n\n\nSo, while many managers and employees don't like or value the process, the\ntasks associated with performance management are central to how any effective\nbusiness or operation is managed. Essentially, we can't live with performance\nmanagement - but we also can't live without it.\n\n\n\n**Best practices to performance management**\n\n\n\nThat said, some savvy organizations are leading the way in reinventing\nperformance management so it delivers greater value. Kapel and Associates\nrecently completed a study on emerging and best practices to better understand\nhow these changes are unfolding.\n\n\n\nOverall, what generally leads performance management to falter is the lack of\nattention to the specific needs of its three major stakeholder groups -\nleaders, people managers and employees - and the extent to which these needs\nare being met.\n\nSimply put, leaders and managers want to be able to recruit and retain top\ntalent, and they want their people to deliver their best to help the\ndepartment and the organization achieve their priority objectives.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, employees generally want to do their best, and they also want their\nmanager to support and guide them, when needed, so they can be successful. And\nthey're looking for a lot more than just \"feedback.\" They want coaching and\nadvice on how to solve problems, build relationships, and get the job done\nright. In addition, they want to be rewarded and recognized for their\ncontributions, including through development and advancement opportunities.\n\n\n\nMost of the things people want out of performance management relate to how\nwork unfolds in the moment, with an eye on current and future success. But the\ntypical performance process delivers just the opposite. It involves looking\nback and judging the past without necessarily fostering the dialogue and\ncoaching needed to make the current employee experience positive and\nproductive.\n\n\n\nThe employers that are most positive about performance management are taking a\nsimilar approach. In particular, they:\n\n\n\n  * leverage goal setting as a means of connecting employees and their work to the broader priorities of their departments and the organization overall\n  * emphasize day-to-day interactions between managers and employees, focused on solving problems, achieving department objectives and delivering a positive employee experience in the \"now\"\n  * emphasize ongoing coaching and development instead of the delivery of \"feedback\" once or twice a year\n  * use customized competency models that are relevant to the user group and applied as part of day-to-day people management activities\n  * use a simplified performance rating scale that contains just a few key levels, so managers aren't forced to split hairs when scoring their people\n  * consider not only employee performance, but also employee potential, when developing their talent strategies.\n\n\n\n**Figuring out pay for performance**\n\n\n\nAs organizations rethink their approach to performance management, one common\nstumbling block is how best to address the link between pay and performance.\n\n\n\nBut budgets for salary and wage increases have been quite modest for as far\nback as most people can remember. That means the dollars given to top\nperformers aren't really that much more than what are awarded to everyone\nelse.\n\n\n\nThis is one of the reasons why the process of rating performance is so\nunpopular with managers and employees alike. It is also why simplifying rating\nscales can be helpful. There is no point in distinguishing across multiple\nlevels of performance if there are no dollars to make corresponding\ndistinctions in rewards.\n\n\n\nThe compensation dimension will hopefully be resolved in time, but that is a\nstory for another day.

A\ngrowing number of organizations recognize the power of teams, changing the way\nthey do work, and adopting team-based structures. These organizations are\nseeing that shifting their model is helping to improve organizational\nperformance. But moving to this model does not come without challenges, and\norganizations are continually looking for tools that can empower their teams\nto succeed. While there is a vast array of tools and technology available,\norganizations can also look to learning technology to help teams quickly\nupskill and collaborate towards a common goal.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n## **The rise of teams**\n\n[As research shows](https://trendsapp.deloitte.com/reports/2019/global-human-\ncapital-trends/organizational-performance.html), the advantages of an agile,\nteam-driven business style, organizational models are steadily changing from\nthe traditional hierarchies to cross-functional digitally-connected \"people\nnetworks.\" In this new world, teams form and change quickly, people move\naround regularly, and new business ideas and projects spin up and wind down as\nneeded to meet business goals.\n\nPreparing for this level of teaming can be challenging\u2014but the rewards are\nworth it. Deloitte's[ research\nshows](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/HumanCapital/ao-\nteam.pdf) that ideas developed by teams with three or more members have a 156\npercent greater appeal to customers than plans from one or two key\ncontributors. When team members bring diverse perspectives, unique skill sets,\nand broad experiences, an organization's potential can grow in measurable\nways. High-performing teams often radiate strength, adaptability, and\nresilience, which can resonate throughout an organization to improve other\ngroups and overall business performance.\n\nPlacing a greater emphasis on teams both relies on and helps strengthen\nindividual performance: The opportunity to work on different teams and try new\nways of working and collaboration can provide a natural path for people to\ndevelop new skills and insights.\n\nBut with this shift, some employees may struggle to transition so quickly into\na new way of working and collaborating. Employees need to be able to learn and\nadapt rapidly to understand their objectives and collaborate with their new\nteam members. Organizations have the opportunity to empower their workers to\nmake that shift using different types of digital tools, ranging from\ncollaboration platforms to digital learning platforms.\n\n**Learn More:[5 Predictions for the Next Decade of Corporate\nL&D;](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/predictions-for-the-next-decade-of-corporate-ld/)**\n\n# **Teaming through Learning Technology**\n\nShifting organizational models and ways of working is one aspect of enabling\nteam-based work. These structures help give organizations and employees\nguidance, but there is still an element of learning that is required to thrive\nin a team-based environment. Additionally, more and more teams are\ngeographically dispersed and require digital solutions to allow them to work\ncollaboratively as a team. Luckily for organizations, there are many different\ntypes of learning technology platforms and tools that can help enable this\nteam-based work. These tools can not only help the teams to collaborate but\ncan also allow individuals to learn quickly as they shift between different\nteams and priorities. While there are many different platforms and tools to\nchoose from, below are three groups of learning technologies that can help\nenable team performance.\n\n  * **Learning Experience Platforms (LXP)** : When individuals are shifting between different teams and opportunities, they often need ways to upskill themselves on relevant information quickly. Curation based learning experience platforms can help enable learners to access appropriate learning faster and more efficiently. For example, learning experience platforms utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) features that help to personalize and contextualize learning for employees. These features can recognize when they have been added to a new team and recommend learning and resources that are relevant to their new assignment.  \n\n  * **Cohort Based Program Delivery Platforms** : As previously mentioned, providing opportunities for employees to learn and collaborate can help them shift into a team-based mindset. Cohort-based, time-bound digital boot camps bridge geographic gaps, build camaraderie, and support teams to learn how to establish a shared understanding of business goals, strategies, and day-to-day tactics. For example, Deloitte's Business Chemistry Digital Experience, powered by AdeptPro, allows cohorts of teams to identify their working style and understand how to better collaborate within the workplace.  \n\n  * **Knowledge Management** : Quickly sharing knowledge across an organization is paramount when teams are working in an agile environment. Organizations have the opportunity to not only leverage the collective intelligence of their employees but also find ways to provide them with easy access to this intelligence. These technologies also help so that no knowledge is lost when team structures change or shift and allow employees easy access to relevant information.\n\n**Learn More:[Adopting an Innovative Approach to Employee Training Program &\nEmployee Engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/adopting-an-innovative-approach-to-employee-training-program-\nemployee-engagement/)**\n\nThese three technologies are a few of the options available for organizations\nto leverage to enable the transition to a team-based model. The below graphic\noutlines additional learning technologies that are available for organizations\nto leverage\n\nThe experience gained through utilizing a digital learning tool can help\nworkers become more effective at influencing and collaborating with teammates\nwhile assisting organizations in achieving the most from new cross-functional\nteaming models. Many organizations already utilize these tools, and simply\nneed to shift their perspective on how they can use them to empower their\nemployees and teams.\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fleveraging-digital-learning-tools-to-drive-\nteaming%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Leveraging+Digital+Learning+Tools+to+Drive+Teaming\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Leveraging+Digital+Learning+Tools+to+Drive+Teaming&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fleveraging-digital-learning-tools-to-drive-\nteaming%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fleveraging-digital-learning-tools-to-drive-\nteaming%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fleveraging-digital-learning-tools-to-drive-\nteaming%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Leveraging Digital Learning Tools to Drive\nTeaming&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fleveraging-digital-learning-tools-to-drive-\nteaming%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Learning & Development ](/category/learning-development/\n\"Learning & Development\")\n\n  * [ ![How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the Future](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/all_about_pwcs_digital_upskilling_program_and_how_you_can_take_inspiration_from_it_5e5fb8b6e3968.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-pwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-future-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the\nFuture ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\npwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-\nfuture-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nPwC has made digital upskilling a top priority to prepare for the future of\nwork.

And what I mean by that it's\nan opportunity to do things you think you could not do before.\u2019-Rahm\nEmanuel**_\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis falls exactly into this bracket. Today, businesses the\nworld over are battling the impact of this global pandemic and the biggest\nquestions that stare them in the face are-how do they ensure business\ncontinuity in this time of crisis? According to a\n[survey](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/talent-management/impact-of-\ncovid-19-on-the-indian-economy-workforce-25114) by the Federation of Indian\nChambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI), the immediate impact of COVID-19\nreveals that besides the direct impact on demand and supply of goods and\nservices, businesses are also facing reduced cash flows due to slowing\neconomic activity which in turn is having an impact on all payments including\nto those for employees, interest, loan repayments, and taxes.\n\nA significant 53 percent of Indian businesses indicate the marked impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on business operations even at early stages. Moreover,\nthe pandemic has significantly impacted the cash flow at organizations with\nalmost 80 percent reporting a decrease in cash flow. Nearly 30 percent\norganizations have already put in place Work-from-Home policies for their\nemployees and about 42 percent of the respondents feel that it could take up\nto 3 months for normalcy to return.\n\nIn such a scenario, how can organizations continue to provide a seamless\nemployee experience to their employees despite the mandatory work from home\n(WFH) situation? Most importantly and urgently, how do they make sure expense\nmanagement is on track given the strain this crisis has put on resources and\ncapabilities. The crisis has affected even the most basic levels of an\norganization\u2019s operational functioning, laying bare the need to re-strategize\nthe building blocks of their employee experience strategy.\n\n_**Take for instance, the routine tasks of employees filing their travel and\nreimbursements. As per[Happay's](https://www.happay.in/) CFO Benchmark study,\n82% of respondents in the study stated that expense claims still had to be\nfiled manually by attaching bills to paper vouchers. Some of the businesses\nhave a semi-automated workflow where just the approvals can be taken\nonline.**_\n\nSo for businesses that have not yet automated expense management, a crisis\nsuch as this makes spend management a challenge, severely impacting the\nemployee experience of their employees in times of crisis. On account of the\nmandatory WFH situation as offices have shut down, employees can\u2019t submit\nexpenses physically nor can the transfer of expense documents can happen on\naccount of the social distancing and contactless sharing complications.\n\nJust like it is important to avoid physical handshakes, and close contact with\neach other, it is equally important to avoid the transfer of physical\ndocuments between employees to stop the viral infection from spreading within\nthe organization. One of the most frequently transferred documents is Expense\nvouchers/bills. Each of the physical vouchers moves hands from employee to\nmanager, and manager to finance, and in between by handlers/runners wherever\nrequired. So it transfers from 3 to 6 pairs of hands, for just one expense\nreport filed. Given the fact that the severe acute respiratory syndrome\ncoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is detectable for up to 24 hours on [cardboard(or\npaper)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973), the transfer of\ndocuments becomes a high risk.\n\nWhile some companies may have resorted to scanning & sending it from the\noffice scanner, but with WFH rapidly becoming the norm, finding scanners is a\nchallenge. And even if some employees are lucky enough to have a shop nearby\nthat provides a scanning service, it is still riskier for the employee to hand\nover the bills/vouchers, and get it back with possible contamination from the\npublic scanner. Also, many companies don\u2019t have a Mobile and cloud-ready spend\nmanagement platform with OCR capabilities for a quick snap and upload of\nbills. Now with social distancing and lockdowns in place, even contactless\nsharing is out of the purview of many employees.\n\n### Strategizing spend management in crisis\n\nThen again, the crisis itself has led to more expenses for employees arising\nout of the need for setting the operational infrastructure to work from home.\nNot all employees might have had a WFH operational structure ready beforehand\nand have had to invest in creating the extra bandwidth for it- be it in terms\nof Wi-Fi connections or virtual collaboration tools or the physical setup.\nThese are not budgeted expenses. Added to these are some ad hoc purchases of\ndisinfectant wipes, gloves, etc., which would also increase the Admin costs of\ncompanies categorized under essential services. Augmenting it further are the\nflight rescheduling & cancellations, last-minute flight bookings, hospital\nreimbursements, group insurance costs and hotel cancellations, which could\nmake a significant impact on any company's bottom line.\n\nThus, for companies, this means relooking at their employee benefits strategy\nin order to make sure digital transfer of benefits happens seamlessly while at\nthe same time they need to strategize expense management and ensure business\ncontinuity as working in a crisis mode becomes the new normal.\n\n> Varun Rathi, Co-founder & COO, Happay aptly says, \u201cIn such unprecedented\n> times, CXOs need a flexible and fully automated spend management platform to\n> keep a tight leash on Covid-19 spends before it spirals out of control. A\n> platform with decent mobile and analytics capabilities, with real-time\n> policy modification possibilities, should be preferred.\u201d\n\nThe crisis thus requires businesses to take a deep and hard look at\noperational expense management. Cost optimization strategies need to be the\nfocus area of HR leaders in order to drive efficiency, manage risk, maintain\nemployee productivity at the same levels as before the crisis, and deliver a\nsmooth and unbroken employee experience despite testing times.\n\n**What are some of the basic actions that can get you started?**\n\nAs per [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/hr-under-pressure-\nto-cut-costs-know-how-to-protect-whats-important/), the first one of them is\nconducting scenario planning to assess the current and future impact of\nCOVID-19 on your function in a structured way, applying reliable criteria.\nBased on likely scenarios, organizations need to define their response from a\ncost optimization perspective and accordingly plan and manage costs.\n\nDevelop a policy to heighten awareness among travelers of the costs they incur\nwhen changing business travel plans for personal reasons or on account of\npandemic cases. For all expenses and ticket cancellation credits related to\nCOVID-19 Cancelled Travel expense type, create an \u2018expense type\u2019 for proper\ntracking of Covid-19 Impact. This can work with both charges and credits and\ncan help in keeping track of canceled travel during this time. For any\nunbudgeted/emergency expenses (such as purchases of disinfectant wipes,\ngloves, etc), create a new expense type for better visibility.\n\n###  Protecting employee experience in times of crisis\n\nHowever, at the same time, there is a need to protect employee experience and\nproductivity during times of crisis. The responsibility of HR to drive talent\noutcomes, in fact, becomes even more critical during testing times.\nProductivity is directly impacted by employee experience and hence the need to\ndeliver a good employee experience even in bad times. Take the case of expense\nmanagement- a simple, intuitive expense management solution such as Happay can\nhelp you deliver the same superlative experience to your employees, be it good\nor bad times, enabling you to maintain similar levels of productivity as in\nnormal times.\n\nAfter all, as aptly stated by [HBR](https://hbr.org/2020/02/lead-your-\nbusiness-through-the-coronavirus-crisis), a crisis doesn\u2019t imply immunity from\nperformance management, and sooner or later markets will judge which companies\nmanaged the challenge most effectively. Nor is the Covid-19 crisis the last of\nthe global crises to hit businesses. HBR\u2019s research on the effectiveness of\norganizational responses to dynamic crises indicates that there is one\nvariable that is most predictive of eventual success \u2013 preparation and\npreemption. And preparing for the next crisis now is likely to be much more\neffective than an ad hoc, reactive response when the crisis actually hits.\n\nThis is why, it is now that there is a dire need for businesses to relook at\ntheir expense management, benefits transfer, and employee experience\nstrategies during a crisis situation. It is now that they need to re-\nstrategize their employee benefits strategy and question whether they are in a\nposition to ensure seamless operational expense management in times of crisis.\nIt will be a changed world after Covid-19 and remote work is going to become\nan even bigger feature of our lives post the crisis. Hence now is the time to\nrelook and reflect and build resilience in your systems and processes and to\nformulate your strategy on business continuity and expense management for the\nfuture world of work\n\n_**Join us for an exclusive webcast in association with Happay on \u2018Decoding\nbusiness continuity and expense management in times of crisis\u2019 on 7th\nApril.[Click here](https://www.peoplematters.in/webcast/watch-decoding-\nbusiness-continuity-and-expense-management-in-times-of-crisis) to register.**_\n\n**_References:-_**\n\n[_https://hbr.org/2020/02/lead-your-business-through-the-coronavirus-\ncrisis_](https://hbr.org/2020/02/lead-your-business-through-the-coronavirus-\ncrisis)\n\n[_https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/hr-under-pressure-to-cut-costs-\nknow-how-to-protect-whats-\nimportant/_](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/hr-under-pressure-to-\ncut-costs-know-how-to-protect-whats-important/)\n\n[_Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2 as Compared with SARS-CoV-1\nStudy published in The New England Journal of\nMedicine_](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973)\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Compensation & Benefits](/category/compensation-\nperformance/compensation-\nbenefits?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=compensation-benefits \"Browse\nmore in: Compensation &amp; Benefits\"), [Employee\nEngagement](/category/compensation-performance/employee-\nengagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=employee-engagement \"Browse\nmore in: Employee Engagement\"),\n[#COVID-19](/tag/covid-19?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=covid-19 \"Browse\nmore in: COVID-19\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Shweta Modgil](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1524982217/authors/shweta-\nmodgil.jpg)](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\n#### [Shweta Modgil](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\nShweta is working as a Senior Features Writer with People Matters.

Digital intimacy has\nbecome the new norm of life. Technology has turned into a ubiquitous commodity\nsuch that even a common man uses words like platforms, ecosystems, Machine\nLearning, AI and Robotics these days.\n\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic nudging most businesses to operate and work\nremotely, the demand for technology is further rising. But are all companies\nready for this change?\n\nA recent global study of more than 25000 Leaders across industries has\nrevealed that only 37 percent of business leaders are prepared to operate in\nsuch a Digital environment. In case of HR leaders, the number further fell\ndown to 16%. If Technology lever alone questions our future readiness as\nleaders, what if it gets quadrupled by adding Talent to the whole equation in\nbuilding new \u2013 age organizations? How Technology is further going to disrupt\nour day to day work? What does \u201cTalent of the future\u201d look like? What will\nthey do at work? How will it impact organizations?\n\nTo answer some of these questions, we closely examined the value of Talent and\nhow it has been influenced by different phases of Industrial revolution.\n\nFor instance, when the first industrial revolution brought mass production\nwith the advent of steam engines and mechanization of textiles in the 18th\ncentury, physical strengths and kinesthetic abilities of workers were valued\nas Talent and we refer to it as Talent 1.0. With the arrival of modern\nagriculture, Electricity and Internal combustion engines in the early 1900s,\nalso popularly known as the second Industrial revolution, standardization of\ngoods and services became a new norm. Due to this, a combination of both\nabilities and social skills were valued as Talent 2.0. During the latter half\nof the 20th century, the world witnessed proliferation of Information and\nDigital advancements in the form of the third Industrial revolution,\nindividuals and organizations were governed by connected devices and augmented\nintelligence. This demanded people to display a new set of competencies which\nhas a combination of not only skills and abilities but also knowledge needed\nto deal with familiar and unfamiliar situations. We call it as Talent 3.0.\n\nThe fourth Industrial revolution has begun due to the intersection of IT, Bio\nand Nano Technologies and its advancements. Studies estimate that 85% of\nfuture roles are going to be way too different than the ones that are existing\ntoday. Klaus Schwab, Chairman of the world economic forum along with stalwarts\nfrom across various faculties such as Business Leaders, Technologists,\nParliamentarians and Historians were set to discuss the future of work and its\nconsequences through multiple forums over the last four years.\n\nBased on our analysis of such conversations and our extensive study on Job\npredictions of reputed sources, we plotted these future jobs across sectors.\nMost of these jobs, we heard about for the first time.\n\nConsider the following terms, Organ Creator, Augment Reality Journey Builder,\nRewilder, Human Machine Teaming Manager, Digital currency Advisor etc. They\nare not science fiction terms but possible jobs of the future. It is quite\nfascinating to see that such jobs are going to be highly interdisciplinary and\nrequires people to display a new set of X factors to perform their duties at\nwork. These factors, in our view, are going to be unique and distinct from the\nprevious eras of Talent. We therefore call it \u201cTalent of the future\u201d or in our\nown words which we have coined \u201cTalent 4.0\u201d.\n\n**Talent 4.0 \u2013 The new factors**\n\nTake a case, Organ creators, whose job is to apply a combination of stem\ncells, molecular biology and synthetic materials to create Human organs. From\nan industry point of view, the job cuts across Manufacturing to Healthcare to\nRetail. Another job for example, Bewilders, who would work on turning back\nconcrete jungles into green belts and forests. Once again, it concedes that a\nsingle role will disrupt multiple industries such as Manufacturing, Energy,\nInsurance and Banking. When such roles come in to existence, we anticipate\nthat workers would require a completely different set of Talents to perform\nsuch jobs.\n\nIn our assessment, we see more than competencies (knowledge, skills and\nattributes), aspects like imagination, design, exploration, transcendence,\ncognitive flexibility and self - nudge would be more valued than ever and they\nare outlined as below:\n\n**Imagination**\n\nBe it an organ creator or a Rewilder, the performance of an individual in most\nfuture jobs is highly dependent on imagination. It means forming new ideas\nwith objects when not sensed by the body. It requires a lot of deliberate\nefforts to tap in to one\u2019s Executive portion of the Brain to visualize new\nform of organs or jungles or similar such objects. Just imagine, turning a\nconcrete jungle in to a forest!\n\n**Design**\n\nThe next key variable in our view is design which denotes creating plans or\nprototypes to show a function of an object. It plays a key role in any of\nthese future jobs like Human \u2013 Machine Teaming Manager where someone takes\ncharge of Teams where Humans and Robots would be working side by side. In such\njobs, it takes so much of design considerations to offer superior experiences\nto people thus demanding each one to become design conscious in the future.\n\n**Exploration**\n\nIt means exploring an unknown area. Future Jobs like Cyber city Detective who\ncould detect mysteries in data in Smart cities which demands data exploration\nin large volumes. Another study predicted jobs such as Digital Tailors who\nwould craft personalized services with a Digital touch by exploring motives\nand needs of people on one \u2013 to \u2013 one basis.\n\n**Cognitive Flexibility**\n\nIt represents the ease at which an individual can switch between multiple\nconcepts at a time. Be it juggling between boundaries of multiple\nspecializations or working in a Human \u2013 Machine Augmented system, Cognitive\nflexibility will be a game changer. Once again, it takes a lot of discipline\nand practice to comfortably navigate between areas yet being mentally alert at\nthe same time.\n\n**Self \u2013 nudge**\n\nIt is another variable which will be demanded in the future. It is needed to\nconstantly alter one\u2019s own behaviors to withstand the momentum of change by\ntapping in to mental shortcuts and assigning default choices. For instance, a\nDigital Tailor prioritizes Digital and imagination as autopilot responses than\ncustomizing on off - the - shelf solutions.\n\n**Transcendence**\n\nUpon going through some of the above jobs, you would have got a sense of how\nimportant it is to experience the connectedness of everyone and everything\nthat exists in this universe. This leads to the prediction of Transcendence as\nthe next key variable. Any of the above discussed jobs require some degree of\ntranscendence among Humans.\n\nThese six above mentioned factors, we call them as Human Ingenuity Factors\n(HIFs). As Oxford Dictionary defines ingenuity as the quality of being clever,\noriginal and inventive, it cannot be categorized as skills or attributes or\ncompetencies. While everyone possesses them, it is difficult to express as and\nwhen needed. Further, it is hard to draw a baseline for comparing individuals\non a scale, unlike the previous century definitions of Talent such as\nabilities, skills and competencies. Therefore, Talent of Future will be a\ncombination of competencies and Human Ingenuity Factors, thus paving way for a\nnew chapter in mankind, the Talent 4.0.\n\nThis conception, in our view, is fundamental to unravel many mysteries\npertaining to Talent of the future. And more we deep dived, we came out with\nmore questions and we intent to leave at least a couple of them for further\ninquiry. How are we going to assess, hire and retain Talent 4.0 based on Human\nIngenuity Factors? What will their development interventions look like? In the\ncase of Gig workers, how do we engage them? As French novelist Gustave\nFlaubert famously said \u201cTalent is a long patience, and originality an effort\nof will and intense observation \u201c, it\u2019s time to lay the foundations to\nmanifest Talent 4.0 or \u201cTalent of future\u201d.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Talent Management](/category/compensation-performance/talent-\nmanagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=talent-management \"Browse more\nin: Talent Management\"), [#GuestArticle](/tag/guest-\narticle?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=guest-article \"Browse more in:\nGuestArticle\"),\n[#COVID-19](/tag/covid-19?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=covid-19 \"Browse\nmore in: COVID-19\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Authors\n\n[![Sudhakar Sampath](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1586252923/authors/avatar-\nsudhakar-sampath.png)](/author/sudhakar-sampath)\n\n#### [Sudhakar Sampath](/author/sudhakar-sampath)\n\nSudhakar Sampath is working with Wipro Limited, Bangalore, India, as Manager,\nLearning and Development, Human Resources.\n\n[![Sarika Pradhan](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1586252809/authors/avatar-\nsarika-pradhan.png)](/author/sarika-pradhan)\n\n#### [Sarika Pradhan](/author/sarika-pradhan)\n\nSarika Pradhan is working with Wipro Limited, Bangalore, India as General\nManager- Human Resources.

management processes and procedures have evolved at a blistering\npace, perhaps faster than any other part of the Human Resources discipline.\n\nPM has transitioned from an industrial-age framework focused on maintaining\nconsistent production schedules and quality to a flexible \u2013 and interconnected\n\u2013 tracking, coaching and talent development tool.\n\nTechnology capabilities and limitations often drove process design in early\nPMS implementations.\n\nOrganizations now require technology solutions that reflect their specific\nperformance management framework and focus on the competencies that enable\ntheir unique strategy.\n\n### Aligning performance management with organizational strategy\n\nTo design an effective performance managemtn system, organizations need to\nunderstand how each job \u2013 and the career ladders or development paths for\nthose jobs - feed into the organization\u2019s strategic goals.\n\nThat understanding provides the framework for how and how often performance\nassessment and guidance is conducted.\n\nIt provides a way to assess performance not just in terms of \u201cwhat have you\ndone for me so far?\u201d but also, \u201cWhere can we best use your talents and\noptimize your skills going forward?\u201d\n\nWhy is that so important?\n\nEffective and[ engaged employees ](https://www.betterbuys.com/talent-\nmanagement/hr-engagement-retention/)share a couple of common characteristics,\nregardless of industry, job function, or seniority.\n\nThey understand how their daily efforts make a difference in whether and how\ntheir organization achieves its strategic goals.\n\nWithout that understanding, how can they to rate their own efforts and see\nwhere they should develop strengths and overcome limitations?\n\nAn effective performance management solution provides the tools to answer that\ndeceptively straightforward question for individual contributors, teams and\norganizations.\n\nAnd, like individual performance goals, a PM system design should flow from a\nclearly-defined strategy. Otherwise, those systems can limit, instead of\nadvancing, that strategy.\n\n### Asking the right questions\n\nOften, discussions about the need for performance management approach the\ntopic at a tactical level.\n\nIndeed, many vendors\u2019 websites suggest that customers look at tactical drivers\nwhen they are researching performance management tools.\n\nThey suggest organizations ask themselves,\" Why are we looking at investing in\na new PMS?\"\n\n    * Compensation decision making?\n    * Administrative support?\n    * Developmental planning and guidance?\n    * General performance measurement and reporting?\n\nFor nearly every organization, the answer is, \u201cYes, all of that.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that there's a growing ecosystem of performance management\ntechnology providers that support those core capabilities. And that\u2019s fine as\nfar as it goes.\n\nBut that is also a problem. In the end, those are questions about the tool\u2019s\ncapabilities, not about the competencies required to implement your strategy.\n\n### Strategy drives competencies, competencies drive PM\n\nStrategy is the expression of an organization\u2019s mission, goals, objectives and\ninterrelated action plans for achieving each of those targets.\n\nThose are the factors that determine what competencies you need to build,\nmaintain and nurture.\n\nMapping strategy components onto various functions \u2014 product development,\nproduction, marketing, sales, management and administration and partnerships \u2014\nhelps define and prioritize the tasks that you ask each of your people to\nperform.\n\nAnswering strategic performance management questions requires the customer,\nand solution provider, to understand how each job \u2013 and any associated\ndevelopment plans and career ladders -[\nfeed](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/how-hr-can-earn-that-elusive-seat-at-\nthe-c-suite-table/)[ ](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/how-hr-can-earn-\nthat-elusive-seat-at-the-c-suite-table/)[into the organization\u2019s strategic\ngoals.](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/how-hr-can-earn-that-elusive-seat-\nat-the-c-suite-table/)\n\nAn understanding of the competencies needed to support your strategic aims\nprovides a framework for defining jobs, assessing performance and guiding\nemployee development.\n\n### Shared understanding of why, what and how\n\nIf each of your processes flow directly from strategy, you can trace\neveryone\u2019s work (actions and behaviors) from task to outcome.\n\nThat allows everyone to see how their work combines with everyone else\u2019s to\nenable the organization\u2019s strategic ambitions.\n\nWhen everyone shares a strategy-based understanding of job responsibilities\nand interdependencies, they are empowered to hold themselves, and each other,\naccountable for outcomes.\n\nThey can see where changes and improvements in their jobs might better support\nstrategy. And they can anticipate and participate in realizing those changes.\n\n### Feedback and adjustment\n\nSo, if everything flows from strategy, is this a one-way, top down process?\n\nNo. Like any successful living organism, companies, government agencies,\ncharitable foundations or any other group enterprise operate in an infinite\n[series of feedback loops and adjustment\nmechanisms](http://blog.competencycore.com/2012/08/linking-performance-\nmanagement-corporate-strategy.html).\n\nDesigning a performance management structure and selecting the tools that can\nbest support that structure needs to be a similarly interactive process.\n\nPMS design needs to include ways to capture and consider input from all\nstakeholders ranging from senior executive management through to line\nmanagers, employees and unions and, in many cases, indirect input from end\ncustomers.\n\n### Are you optimizing people or processes?\n\nWhen companies were measuring how many acceptable widgets came off production\nLine B, and knew they\u2019d be making those widgets for the foreseeable future,\nperformance was easier to assess and to manage.\n\nEmployees weren\u2019t expected to change tasks on the fly, if at all. Training\nrequirements were well-defined and could focus on a few specific skills.\n\nToday, however, you need every employee ready to quickly learn new skills and\nperform new tasks to support an evolving strategy.\n\nManagers need visibility into how workers\u2019 capabilities fit with their current\njobs and insight into any talents and interests that would be valuable\nelsewhere.\n\nWorkers need to see how their skills fit with current tasks and what new\nskills they can and should develop to climb their chosen career ladder.\n\nThat means both managers and workers need a holistic view of current and\nfuture competency requirements.\n\nAnd there is a real payoff: the more of a role your employees play in\nrecommending and selecting [skills they want to\ndevelop](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/career-development-in-demand/),\nthe more excited they will be to use those skills.\n\n### Performance management is everyone's responsibility\n\nOf course, these highly complex and interdependent performance management\ntools and processes are only valuable if used consistently across your\norganization.\n\nHere again, tying the performance management process back to strategy makes it\nclear to all stakeholders just how critical it is.\n\nLeadership support for and continued attention to employee development sets\nthe tone, but ease of use plays a huge part in how effective PM processes and\ntechnology solutions are for the organization.\n\nEmployees and managers need to be able to learn and use PM systems without a\nmassive time investment that takes away from productivity.\n\nThat means organizations need to make learning and using performance\nmanagement processes and tools part of every job description.\n\nAnd organizations should push PMS providers to continually improve both user\ninterfaces and user training so those meet your specific needs.\n\n### Measuring performance management ROI\n\nPerformance management systems provide powerful tools for developing and\nnurturing competencies, making them among the most important investments an\norganization must make.\n\nUltimately, performance management that maximizes workforce development and\nflexibility in line with a strategic framework is what differentiates\nsuccessful and less successful organizations - even in the most highly-\nautomated industries.\n\nThe return on your performance management investment can be measured in\nfinancial terms reflecting increased efficiency, reduced turnover and other\nmetrics.\n\nBut the true measure of a successful PMS implementation is a flexible,\nteachable workforce that understands and supports your strategy and that has\nthe resources they need to succeed and grow with your business.  \n  \n\n![Tim\nMcElgunn](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Tim\nMcElgunn](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Tim\nMcElgunn](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/newtimart-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Tim McElgunn](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/tmcelgunn/)\n\nTim, a member of the HRMorning staff, is a veteran writer and editor.

performance management requires managers to create an environment in\nwhich employees are enabled to perform to the best of their abilities.\n\nBeing able to do that will depend heavily on whether you\u2019ve mastered these\nfive essential performance management skills.\n\n## Skill 1: Listening\n\nGood communication is achieved more through a manager\u2019s ability to listen than\non his or her speaking skills. When leaders listen well, they absorb issues,\nunderstand feelings, foresee potential problems and solutions, and eventually\ncommunicate the right decisions in the right tone.\n\nAny leader can hear and parrot back information. Good leaders listen so they\ncan process the information.\n\nFollow these tips to better listening:\n\n**\u2022 Keep yourself clear.** When employees, colleagues, clients or customers\nneed their managers, it\u2019s important to give them undivided attention by\ntalking privately at an arranged time with no distractions (e-mail, phones,\npaperwork).\n\n**Tip:** When employees ask their managers, \u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d If they\ndon\u2019t have time they can respond, \u201cI only have a minute right now. If you need\nmore time, I\u2019d be happy to arrange a meeting later today.\u201d\n\n**\u2022 Take notes.** This serves two purposes: It helps leaders remember what\u2019s\nbeen said and keeps track of the most important facts and emotions. Taking\nnotes also shows people you care and are listening whole-heartedly.\n\n**\u2022 Hold your tongue.** Avoid interrupting speakers, especially in one-on-one\nconversations. Let others get through the facts and emotions. Often, just\nspilling their guts is enough to make them feel better \u2013 and you\u2019re a hero for\nlistening and not saying a word!\n\n**\u2022 Get focused.** If managers have an important task to accomplish, they\nshould make a note of it [before they start a conversations with\nsomeone](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/dont-press-send-7-email-faux-pas-\nyou-want-to-avoid/). That way they can stop thinking about the call to make,\ne-mail to send, report to finish, etc., and focus on the conversation at hand.\n\n**\u2022 Withhold judgment.** Put aside unrelated personal feelings about people\nand their circumstances when listening to them. Instead, focus on the facts\nand acknowledge emotions.\n\n**\u2022 Be open to opinions.** Leaders sometimes don\u2019t agree with what employees,\nco-workers, clients and customers say \u2013 and stop listening because they\u2019re\nfocusing on their rebuttal. Instead, they should continue to listen and note\ntheir points when it\u2019s their turn to talk.\n\n**\u2022 Respond, don\u2019t react.** Finally, when you\u2019re done listening and ready to\ntalk, focus on giving a response rather than a reaction. What\u2019s the\ndifference?\n\n\u2022 A response is a balance of thought and emotion, and often includes a\nquestion so you can better understand.\n\n\u2022 A reaction is mostly an emotional action that lacks thought and\nunderstanding of what the other person said.\n\n## Skill 2: Communicating\n\nCommunicating well is the cornerstone of good relationships. Whether leaders\nare talking to employees or colleagues, writing e-mails, training or speaking\nin front of a group, these communication essentials will help:\n\n**\u2022 Create a commonality.** Once leaders know their colleagues and employees,\nthey can share information about themselves that they have in common (for\ninstance, a hobby, past experience in work or life, an interest in events or\nsports, etc.). It makes them more approachable.\n\n**\u2022 Be courteous.** People will listen, and things will get done if managers\ncommunicate with courtesy. For example, \u201cCan you please \u2026?\u201d \u201cI need you to do\n\u2026 Will you be able to?\u201d \u201cPlease take care of \u2026\u201d\n\n**\u2022 Be consistent.** Match your tone of voice with your words.\n\n**\u2022 Clarify.** When the topic is important (not just casual), it\u2019s vital for\nmanagers to make sure they\u2019re understood. For example, they could ask \u201cWhat\nquestions do you have about this report?\u201d\n\n**\u2022 Show confidence.** Back up statements with facts. Leaders should try to\navoid tentative language such as might, maybe, possibly and ASAP.\n\n### Soft skill 3: Delivering bad news\n\nOnly one thing can be worse than hearing bad news: delivering it. Nearly every\nleader has to deliver bad news at one time or another. [Doing it with\nfinesse](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/hiring-grads-with-soft-skills/)\nwill help managers go down in company history as a well-liked professional.\n\nHere\u2019s how to deliver bad news so it\u2019s a little easier on the people affected\nby it:\n\n**\u2022 Make it fast.** Delivering the news as quickly as possible gives people a\nchance to plan their next move. One caveat: Avoid delivering bad news on a\nFriday (or whatever is the end of the work week) so the news doesn\u2019t fester\nwith people for days, and they come back to work upset or resentful.\n\n**\u2022 Visit or call.** Deliver bad news personally. When leaders do this, it\nshows they care about how the news will affect their people. Delivering bad\nnews via e-mail or a memo suggests leaders are distancing themselves from the\npeople and situation.\n\n**\u2022 Be honest**. Managers don\u2019t have to reveal every detail (because some are\npersonnel- or financial-related). Plus, people don\u2019t have time for all the\ndetails. But to maintain credibility, leaders want to avoid covering up\nmistakes, forgetfulness or miscommunications that led to decisions and bad\nnews.\n\n**\u2022 Take responsibility.** Leaders don\u2019t want to blame themselves, their\nbosses or the company if they aren\u2019t to blame. Then again, don\u2019t blame \u201cthe\neconomy\u201d for everything, either. Acknowledge your part in the situation\nwithout being defensive.\n\n**\u2022 Respond.** Give employees, co-workers, clients or customers a chance to\ndiscuss how the bad news affects them. Acknowledge their feelings, and offer\nsuggestions on how to deal with the situation.\n\n## Soft skill 4: Negotiating\n\nMost leaders negotiate from the moment they get up in the morning, through the\nworkday and well into the evening whether it\u2019s with family, friends or co-\nworkers.\n\nNo matter the situation, the most successful negotiators still develop long-\nterm relationships, and help themselves and others succeed in the end.\n\nLeaders who strive to get what they want, but be fair and keep others happy,\nfollow these negotiating tactics:\n\n**\u2022 Balance participation.** All people want to be involved in decisions that\naffect them. Once managers offer their thoughts and positions, it\u2019s a good\nidea to ask for the other person\u2019s thoughts on the subject. Most importantly,\nmanagers should consider how the benefits and drawbacks affect others before\nthey meet. Managers who see the situation through their employees\u2019 eyes often\nfind reasonable solutions faster.\n\n**\u2022 Understand the other side.** Before moving on to the final decisions and\nsolutions, it\u2019s important for managers to show they\u2019ve heard and understand\nwhat others have said and feel. Some key phrases:\n\n\u2022 \u201cI understand that you want \u2026 \u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cI sense that you feel this way about the situation \u2026 \u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cYou seem to want \u2026 Do I have that right?\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cYour position is \u2026 Would you agree with my assessment?\u201d\n\n**\u2022 Be prepared to offer several options.** It\u2019s a good idea for leaders to\ncome to the meeting knowing their highest priorities and what they\u2019d be\nwilling to give up to make negotiations work. They should also encourage\nothers to do the same. Then once both sides understand one another\u2019s\npositions, leaders can throw out several potential solutions.\n\n## Soft skill 5: Giving criticism\n\nUnfortunately, employees don\u2019t always do things that make their managers\nproud, or perform at a level that deserves thanks and recognition. Then\nmanagers have to criticize employees\u2019 work or behavior. While this is a task\nno manager looks forward to, it can be done with finesse and without making\nemployees resentful.\n\nHere are seven keys for [delivering criticism with\nfinesse](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/does-your-employee-review-process-\nactually-improve-performance/):\n\n    1. **Behind closed doors**. Follow the old rule \u201cPraise in public, criticize in private.\u201d\n\n2\\. **No finger-pointing.** When phrases like \u201cYou should have \u2026 \u201d or \u201cWhy\ndidn\u2019t you \u2026 ?\u201d are used, people quickly become defensive.\n\nInstead, try one of these:\n\n\u2022 \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that you \u2026 \u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed that you \u2026 \u201d\n\n**3\\. Avoid sugarcoating.** Many leaders don\u2019t want to hurt other people\u2019s\nfeelings, so they \u201csandwich\u201d criticism between two compliments. Avoid this\nbecause some people will filter out the criticism and focus on the praise.\nInstead go right to the issue, mention past successes and ask where the\nproblem is.\n\nExample: \u201cJoan, this report is incomplete. You\u2019re usually very thorough. Can\nyou tell me what\u2019s happened here?\u201d\n\n**4\\. Criticize one thing at a time.** Criticizing several things at one time\nwill lighten the importance of each item. Plus, it\u2019ll make people feel as if\nthey\u2019re failing at everything \u2013 not just one or two things.\n\n**5\\. Be specific** about the change that\u2019s needed. Often what leaders want\nfixed, stopped or changed is obvious to them, but may not be so obvious to the\nperson who needs to do it. So it\u2019s vital to be specific on what needs to\nchange. For example, instead of, \u201cFrom now on, I need it ASAP,\u201d say \u201cStarting\nthis week, I want it by 9 a.m. Friday.\u201d Or instead of, \u201cYou need to eliminate\nmore errors,\u201d say, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to drop the error rate by 50%.\u201d\n\n**6\\. Be timely.** This makes the feedback seem supportive, not critical.\nWhile it isn\u2019t always practical to hold off on criticism, this approach allows\nmanagers to help employeesmake adjustments that will last longer.\n\n**7\\. Involve others.** Even when managers have specific changes in mind that\nneed to be made, employees are more likely to embrace the changes when they\u2019re\npart of the solution. Consider saying:\n\n\u2022 \u201cDo you have any ideas on how to make sure you \u2026 \u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cWhat can I do to help you \u2026 ?\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cI have some suggestions on how you can do this, but let me hear your ideas\nfirst.\u201d\n\n![Rich\nHenson](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Rich\nHenson](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Rich\nHenson](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/rhensonnewfinal-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Rich Henson](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/rhenson/)\n\nRich Henson, a member of the HRMorning staff, has spent the past two decades\ndeveloping potent HR and Management content that helps guide successful\nleaders forward with confidence.

\"Posts\nby Jim Barnett\") on 20 Dec 2019 in [Business\nperformance](https://www.personneltoday.com/economics-government-\nbusiness/business-performance/), [Latest\nNews](https://www.personneltoday.com/ct/latest-news/), [Employee\nengagement](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr-strategy/employee-engagement/),\n[Performance management](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr-\npractice/performance-management/)\n\n![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/12/performance-management-and-engagement-\nshutterstock_485063863.jpg)\n\nShutterstock\n\n**Employee engagement and performance management have traditionally been two\nseparate facets of HR\u2019s role. But both need to be better aligned for\norganisations to get the most from their people, argues Jim Barnett.**\n\nIt\u2019s well understood that there\u2019s a strong link between employee engagement\nand overall business performance. Three-quarters of respondents to [a recent\nsurvey from The Harvard Business Review Analytic\nServices](https://hbr.org/sponsored/2019/10/peak-performance) strongly agreed\nthat engaged employees tend to be higher performers, while nearly as many,\n69%, strongly agreed that it is difficult to improve performance without also\nimproving engagement.\n\n## Performance management\n\n**[Three ways to solve the continuous performance management\npuzzle](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/how-hr-tech-is-solving-the-\ncontinuous-performance-management-puzzle-cpm/)**\n\n**[The end of the annual appraisal: what\u2019s next for performance\nmanagement?](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/end-annual-appraisal-whats-\nnext-performance-management/)**\n\nWhile there is a clear correlation between the two, bringing performance\nmanagement and engagement into alignment requires careful balancing by HR\ndepartments. These two activities grew out of quite different parts of HR,\nwith performance management approaches tending to focus on assessment and\nemployee engagement typically focusing on listening and feedback.\n\nProcesses that focus only on engagement and that aren\u2019t linked to performance\nmanagement may not serve the organisation\u2019s best interests. It\u2019s only by\nbringing the two concepts together that HR can create programmes that lead to\nhappiness and success at work. When companies help people to develop their\nskills and recognise them for great performance, engagement increases.\n\nKnowing this should create a sense of urgency for organisations of all sizes\nto better integrate engagement into performance management processes.\n\n## A balanced approach\n\nThe combined approach can be very powerful. A $9 billion integrated global\nhealth company that took part in the HBR research has tied engagement to\nmetrics including patient satisfaction scores, quality scores, patient safety,\nreadmissions, and even hospital revenue. It found a strong correlation between\nnear-miss safety incidents and low employee engagement, too.\n\nLikewise, a 7,000-person software company with offices in the US, India, the\nPhilippines and Spain has demonstrated a positive correlation of +0.97 between\nengagement and the company\u2019s stock price. A correlation of +1.0 is a perfect\ncorrelation, meaning that the variables in question, in this case engagement\nand stock price, move together in the same direction and by the same\npercentage.\n\nFinally, the research found that those respondents who agree with the\nstatement \u201cWe do a good job linking employee performance/engagement to\nbusiness outcomes,\u201d outperformed the rest of the respondents on a variety of\nbusiness metrics, from revenue growth, quality, customer satisfaction,\nproductivity to profitability, and more.\n\nOf course, ensuring that performance management and employee engagement work\nin partnership isn\u2019t easy. The two disciplines have evolved in discrete parts\nof the organisation, which means they are likely to use separate systems, rely\non disparate data, and have different people managing them.\n\nBringing the two together requires a new approach. Having integrated systems\nand processes is the ideal, but the reality is that most organisations still\noperate with engagement and performance management in silos.\n\n## The role of line managers\n\nThe manager\u2019s role in an integrated approach is critical, as indicated in the\nHarvard Business Review research. Respondents said employee relationships with\ntheir supervisor has a greater impact on engagement than anything else.\n\nBringing the two together requires a new approach. Having integrated systems\nand processes is the ideal, but the reality is that most organisations still\noperate with engagement and performance management in silos.\"\n\nThe key is for companies to equip managers with the skills and mindset to\nmanage performance in this new, unified and agile way, and offer managers\ntraining to focus on development and coaching. Discussing engagement scores\nfrequently at management meetings, with a focus on conversations and taking\naction, needs to become commonplace.\n\nEffective performance management that also increases engagement requires the\nright data and tools in addition to training. Without access to the right\ndata, managers will struggle to take effective action.\n\nFinally, by providing them with access to the data and the tools they need,\nmanagers can have much more meaningful employee conversations about\npriorities, goals, and growth.\n\nBy viewing performance management and engagement in this way, organisations\ncan reap the benefits of both happy employees and productivity gains.\n\n![Jim Barnett](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2018/12/GLINT_JimBarnettHeadshot.jpg.jpg)\n\n#### About Jim Barnett\n\nJim Barnett is CEO of employee engagement measurement firm Glint\n\n[ View all posts by Jim Barnett ->\n](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/author/jimbarnett/)\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/transgender-tweets-maya-\nforstater/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/seasonal-affective-disorder-\nhow-to-support-staff-through-the-winter/)\n\n##### No comments yet.\n\n### Leave a Reply [Click here to cancel reply.](/hr/linking-performance-\nmanagement-and-engagement/#respond)\n\nComment\n\nName (required)\n\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\n\nWebsite\n\n### Related posts:\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2019/09/Sam-\nUnderhill-PA-45492015.jpg)What the Rugby World Cup teaches us about honesty in\nbusiness](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/workplace-culture-honesty-\nperformance-rugby-world-cup/ \"What the Rugby World Cup teaches us about\nhonesty in business\")\n\nAs the Rugby World Cup gets under way in Japan, Dr Austin Swain examines the\nbrutal honesty that exists in...\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/06/clocking-in-635.jpg)When does keeping tabs on\nworking time overstep the line?](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/when-does-\nkeeping-tabs-on-working-time-overstep-the-line/ \"When does keeping tabs on\nworking time overstep the line?\")\n\nA recent ECJ case means employers will need to more closely track employee\ntime at work.

Everett](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Cath-Everett)\n\nPublished: 08 Nov 2019\n\nThe talk in the HR world for many years now has been that the end of the\nannual performance review is nigh. Indeed, a raft of large companies, such as\nMicrosoft, IBM, GE and Accenture, hit the headlines about four years ago,\nafter stating such [appraisals were no longer fit for\npurpose](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-\nrelations/pages/performance-reviews-are-dead.aspx) and that they were formally\nditching them.\n\nSuch a stance would appear to have some justification, too. A [US\nstudy](http://www.hermanaguinis.com/PPsych2012.pdf) based on the performance\nratings of 23,000 staff from 40 companies found no sign that this kind of\nyearly evaluation had any impact on profits or losses, or bore any relation to\norganisational performance.\n\nIn fact, the research conducted by Herman Aguinis, professor of management at\nGeorge Washington University, and Ernest O\u2019Boyle, associate professor at the\nKelley School of Business at Indiana University, indicated that in most\ninstances an organisation\u2019s top 1% of workers account for 10% of its total\nproductivity.\n\nIn other words, no matter how long managers spend on [undertaking annual\nperformance\nreviews](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/5-performance-management-\nchallenges-and-how-to-fix-them), the vast majority of workers, who are\ngenerally competent but unexceptional, make roughly the same contribution to\nthe company\u2019s bottom line.\n\nAs a result of such scepticism, combined with widespread dissatisfaction among\nemployees, managers and HR professionals alike with activities that all too\noften end up being tick box exercises, the concept of [continuous performance\nmanagement](https://hrdailyadvisor.blr.com/2018/11/07/how-does-continuous-\nperformance-management-work/) (CPM) was born.\n\nCPM involves managers and employees \u2013 and even teams or the wider organisation\n\u2013 exchanging feedback over the course of the year rather than as a one-off\nevent. But it also includes activities such as short-term objective- and long-\nterm goal-setting as well as regular one-to-one input taking place too.\n\nThis approach was believed to promise great things in terms of making\ninteractions between staff and leaders more pertinent and timely, while\nreducing managers\u2019 admin burden at the same time.\n\n### __Employee experience\n\nAs Robert Ordever, managing director of OC Tanner Europe \u2013 which provides\nemployee recognition and reward software and services \u2013 points out: \u201cOur\nlatest research indicates that 92% of people describe \u2018employee experience\u2019 as\ntheir everyday work life rather than milestone moments. So the employee\nexperience is what\u2019s happening today \u2013 and performance management should\nalways be part of that.\u201d\n\nFor example, if someone deserves praise or makes a mistake, it makes sense to\nengage with the individual concerned immediately or the moment is gone.\n\u201cQuicker feedback means faster improvement, but it also helps to humanise the\nprocess and build a more \u2018human\u2019 connection between leaders and employees,\u201d\nsays Ordever.\n\nDespite the promise offered by CPM, though, adoption has to date been limited,\nwith the market only just starting to take off.\n\nIn fact, according to [HR consultancy Mercer\u2019s _2019 Global performance\nmanagement_ report](https://www.mercer.com/our-thinking/career/performance-\ntransformation-in-the-future-of-work.html), the total number of organisations\nstill using annual reviews has fallen by a mere 10% to 84% over the past six\nyears \u2013 even though only 2% of respondents believe their current performance\nmanagement system offers \u201cexceptional\u201d value.\n\n### __Supporting CPM adoption\n\nSo just why is this the case \u2013 and could the advent of suitable technology\nhelp to speed CPM adoption up? According to Dunja Wolff, manager of HR\nconsultancy NGA Human Resources\u2019 client digital transformation team, even\nthough CPM is not yet commonly adopted, HR departments are looking at the\nnotion quite widely.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an acknowledgement of the fact that the traditional performance\napproach is not up-to-scratch any more,\u201d she says. \u201cBut while some\norganisations are moving to CPM and getting rid of their annual appraisals,\nmany aren\u2019t there yet and others are choosing to start slowly by adding one or\ntwo feedback features on top of the annual process.\u201d\n\nThis hybrid form of CPM is most common today, Wolff adds, because it is the\nleast disruptive and unsettling. For instance, if moving to a pure CPM\napproach in which annual appraisals are no more, it is usually necessary to\nadjust staff compensation models, perhaps by moving them to a quarterly model,\nwhich can come up against resistance from compensation teams.\n\nBut there are other issues, too. \u201cYou\u2019re moving from a situation where things\nare very controlled and the roles of employees and managers are clearly\ndefined to one in which the lines are more blurred, particularly if you\u2019re\ngiving multi-directional feedback. So it can be quite unsettling for managers\nand they may need support,\u201d says Wolff.\n\n#### Read more about continuous performance management\n\n  * What is [continuous performance management](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/continuous-performance-management)?\n  * [Continuous performance management](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Continuous-performance-management-was-Workday-ethos-before-tech) was Workday ethos before tech.\n  * In today's world, [using traditional annual reviews to manage performance is as effective as relying on print newspapers to get breaking news](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Four-continuous-performance-management-best-practices). Here's how to make a shift to ongoing feedback.\n\nSuch support includes not only providing access to suitable mentoring and\ntraining, but also taking time to convince them of the value of a move that\nmany will inevitably feel is simply adding to their workload. As a result, to\nlower resistance and make this shift from a top-down assessment approach to\none that is more growth and development-oriented more likely, gaining\nexecutive sponsorship will prove vital.\n\nOrdever agrees. \u201cHR are pushing for this in some organisations, but leaders\noften resist \u2013 and HR don\u2019t want to remove the annual performance review\nbefore there\u2019s something adequate to replace it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s linked to\npromotions, pay increases and dealing with disputes, so you don\u2019t want to\nremove one until the other is right.\u201d\n\nThere are currently a range of standalone and bolt-on software systems on the\nmarket to support a shift to CPM, which enable structured, more collaborative\nconversations as both managers and staff have access to content.\n\nSuch applications from suppliers, such as Clear Review, BetterWorks and\nLattice, also make it easier to set action points and undertake data analysis\nto spot areas of need in order to help tailor learning and development plans.\n\nBut ultimately, to ensure success, it is less about the technology itself and\nmore about having a suitable company culture in place \u2013 something that\ninevitably takes time to implement. As such, because \u201cCPM is a journey\u201d, Wolff\nbelieves that it can take between two to three years to introduce and embed\neffectively.\n\n\u201cCPM tends to be introduced as one part of a bigger cultural transformation or\nas a driver to change mind sets and bring in more flexibility,\u201d she says. \u201cSo\nthis isn\u2019t usually just about an HR process or a tech project \u2013 it\u2019s related\nto much larger ambitions.\u201d\n\n### __MessageBird hybrid CPM\n\nMessageBird has layered quarterly performance reviews (QPRs) and regular pulse\nsurveys on top of its annual appraisal process as part of a bid to create an\neffective feedback culture.\n\nThe communications platform provider, which was set up in 2011, adopted this\napproach at the start of the year, not only to boost employee engagement but\nalso ensure staff have a clear view of their own performance and how it\ncontributes to the bigger organisational picture.\n\n\u201cWhen you increase headcount, the danger is that there\u2019s not enough time for\nmanagers and employees to have proper conversations anymore,\u201d says chief\noperating officer Mayke Nagtegaal. \u201cBuilding a startup is a bumpy road, so it\nmakes sense to try and make the performance management process as smooth as\npossible and set things up for success early on.\u201d\n\nAnother driver behind the move was to support the company in its requirement\nto \u201cmove fast and make decisions quickly\u201d, she says. While \u201cmany employees\nwere hungry for feedback\u201d, it had become clear that, as the company grew, an\nannual appraisal approach alone was unable to provide either sufficient\nregular guidance or \u201cclarity of expectations\u201d.\n\nAs a result, QPRs were introduced as a vehicle for managers to provide\nfeedback on the quarter just gone, set individual goals for the quarter ahead\nand determine what personal development activity might be required to help.\nYear-end appraisals now focus mainly on discussing renumeration and possible\ncareer progression opportunities.\n\n\u201cFeedback shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. If you\u2019re engaged with your employees at\nthe right level and quarterly feedback is well documented, yearly reviews\nshould become much easier,\u201d says Nagtegaal.\n\n### __BambooHR\n\nThe company uses its\n[BambooHR](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/ECM-platforms-\ncentralize-HR-data-but-not-without-challenges) system to facilitate, document\nand store data from quarterly and year-end appraisals that can be accessed by\nboth employees and their line managers. Managers are also encouraged to hold\nweekly, or fortnightly, one-on-one meetings for more informal catch-ups with\ntheir staff as well as provide feedback, both positive and negative, in the\nmoment.\n\nBut such feedback is not considered to be a one-way street. As a result, each\nweek, an anonymous pulse survey of employee sentiment is undertaken using the\nOffice Vibe app, which is integrated with [Slack\u2019s collaboration\ntools](https://searchcontentmanagement.techtarget.com/feature/Why-Slack-\ncollaboration-catches-on-where-others-cant).\n\nThese surveys cover everything from how to improve QPRs to whether staff are\nhappy with a new initiative. Peer feedback has also been introduced both at a\nteam and company-wide level too.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to scale an organisation, you need to hear the good, the\nbad and the ugly, especially from those who may not feel comfortable giving\nyou candid feedback directly,\u201d says Nagtegaal \u2013 although she also points out\nthat such insights do need to be acted on rather than simply noted and\nignored.\n\nBut doing so is already showing improvements in both employee and managers\u2019\nengagement levels, she believes. \u201cIf people feel the company cares and they\ncan grow and learn, it\u2019s a big driver for them to stay \u2013 and also to join in\nthe first place,\u201d she says. \u201cWe only started measuring staff retention at the\nbeginning of the year, but already we can see it going up.\u201d\n\n####  __Read more on Information management\n\n  * [\n\n##### corporate performance management (CPM)\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/rouse_margaret.jpg) By:\nMargaret Rouse\n](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/corporate-\nperformance-management)\n\n  * [\n\n##### 360 review\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/rouse_margaret.jpg) By:\nMargaret Rouse\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/360-review)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Companies take different paths with SAP performance review software\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/ring_dan.jpg) By: Dan Ring\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/450401207/Companies-take-\ndifferent-paths-with-SAP-performance-review-software)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Your essential guide to CPM tools, tips and vendors\n\n](https://searcherp.techtarget.com/essentialguide/Your-essential-guide-to-CPM-\ntools-tips-and-vendors)\n\n__Latest News\n\n  * [Judge refuses to delay Assange's extradition hearing over coronavirus pandemic](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481299/Judge-refuses-to-delay-Assanges-extradition-hearing-over-coronavirus-pandemic)\n  * [Coronavirus: Home business opportunity knocks for consumer IoT suppliers](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481286/Coronavirus-Home-business-opportunity-knocks-for-consumer-IoT-suppliers)\n  * [Happy developers write secure code, report claims](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252481215/Happy-developers-write-secure-code-report-claims)\n  * [View All News](https://www.computerweekly.com/news)\n\n__Download CW Asia-Pacific\n\n  * [![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/APAC-0320-cover-252px.jpg)](https://www.computerweekly.com/ezine/CW-Asia-Pacific/CW-APAC-Expert-Advice-on-the-security-operations-centre) In The Current Issue:\n    * Inside the security operations centre: The nerve centre of security operations\n    * Defining and evaluating SOC as a service\n[ Download Current Issue](https://www.computerweekly.com/ezine/CW-Asia-\nPacific/CW-APAC-Expert-Advice-on-the-security-operations-centre)\n\n__Latest Blog Posts\n\n  * [Combatting Covid Fraud: both doorstep and on-line: clarifying the sources of guidance](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/When-IT-Meets-Politics/Combatting-Covid-Fraud-both-doorstep-and-on-line-clarifying-the-sources-of-guidance) - When IT Meets Politics\n  * [IT modernisation series \u2013 Riverbed: Don\u2019t leave ops in the dark](https://www.computerweekly.com/blog/CW-Developer-Network/IT-modernisation-series-Riverbed-Dont-leave-ops-in-the-dark) - CW Developer Network\n  * [View All Blogs](https://www.computerweekly.com/blogs)\n\n__Related Content\n\n  * [Performance appraisal software pushes anonymous ...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Performance-appraisal-software-pushes-anonymous-feedback) - SearchHRSoftware\n  * [How to make the most of your annual appraisal](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/How-to-make-the-most-of-your-annual-appraisal) - ComputerWeekly.com\n  * [Corporate performance management, not BI, will be ...](https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/news/1507244/Corporate-performance-management-not-BI-will-be-pervasive) - SearchBusinessAnalytics\n\n####  __Join the conversation\n\n###  __ 2 comments\n\nSend me notifications when other members comment.

In this type of constantly evolving climate, effective\ncommunication is critical to keeping employees informed, reassured and safe \u2013\nand will ultimately determine an organization\u2019s ability to recover and whether\nthe challenging times.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834cadce393.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nYet, many organizations are woefully unprepared to properly align and support\nemployees during global threats like\n[COVID-19](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/tools-and-\nstrategies-to-set-up-a-remote-workforce-during-covid19-outbreak/). In fact,\n[44% of business leaders](https://instituteforpr.org/coronavirus-\ncovid-19-comms-report/) admitted that their current crisis communications plan\ndid not specifically address an infectious disease outbreak. As the pandemic\ncontinues to unfold, organizations must recognize that the choices, actions,\nand priorities they take will have both a short- and long-term impact on their\nworkforce and overall success. Fortunately, 42% of companies that experienced\na crisis in the past emerged stronger and healthier from it.\n\nWith this in mind, here are three strategies that HR, communications and\nbusiness leaders can take to illustrate the commitment to their employees.\n\n## **Be Proactive**\n\nDon\u2019t wait for employees to come to you. [Recent\nresearch](https://www.edelman.com/research/edelman-trust-\ncovid-19-demonstrates-essential-role-of-private-sector) found that employer\ncommunications are the most trusted source of information about the\ncoronavirus. Your employees are looking to you - so show them you are\nanswering their questions, concerns, and needs. This means proactively sending\nupdates and information and ensuring you can reach the entire workforce,\nwhether at a desk or on a factory floor.\n\nWith updates occurring daily if not hourly, employees need a source of truth.\nConsider establishing a dedicated COVID-19 communication and information hub \u2013\nthat can reach employees where they are \u2013 so all employees have access to\ncritical company information on their preferred device or digital channel.\nOnce the right\n[communication](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/5-steps-to-improve-your-communications-around-open-enrollment/)\nsystem is in place, HR teams should focus on providing timely, transparent\ncommunications with concrete steps to break through the noise, and ensure\nworkers know exactly what is happening and what they need to do in response.\nEmployees are overwhelmed with communications during this time and creating a\nsingular, company-backed source of truth will help them weed out\nmisinformation and determine which messages are most urgent.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Use Technology to Streamline Communication in the\nOffice](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/how-to-use-technology-\nto-streamline-communication-in-the-office/)**\n\n## **Target and Personalize your Message**\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember there is no one-size-fits-all when\n[communicating](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/effective-communication-in-the-workplace-how-and-why/) with\nemployees \u2013 both in terms of the medium and the message. Not every employee\nconsumes communications in the same way, and different employees may have\ndifferent concerns about how the situation impacts them. While some may prefer\nupdates via brief text on mobile or video update, others may want in-depth\ndetails on what\u2019s happening now and in the future.\n\nThis is why HR teams should not only target all digital channels, such as a\nmobile, intranet, digital signage, and email but also tailor and personalize\nmessages to various groups of employees to meet their unique needs and\npreferences. It is essential to target and personalize the messages by\nlocation, function, department and management status to give employees exactly\nwhat they need to feel informed and supported... For global companies,\nautomatic translations are a must-have to allow HR professionals to broadcast\ninformation with speed and clarity and show every worker that they are\nimportant.\n\n## **Listen, Track and Measure Employee Response**\n\nMeasurement is a key asset for success but only 66% of [internal\ncommunications](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/is-your-internal-communications-strategy-evolving-with-tech/)\nprofessionals look to reports and\n[dashboards](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/developing-the-dashboard-the-importance-of-realtime-visibility-in-hr/) to\ntrack [performance](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/impacts-on-employee-engagement-with-performance-management/). If\nyou can\u2019t measure your communications, how will you know what\u2019s working and\nwhat isn\u2019t? Particularly during times of crisis, taking a data-driven approach\nis critical to gauge how your employees are reacting and responding. By\ntracking and measuring communications in real-time, HR teams can quickly\nadjust their strategy and make more informed decisions moving forward.\nUnderstanding how employees respond to the company updates can also help\ncontain any negative situations or [manage\nteams](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/top-5-team-\nbuilding-activities-for-staff-motivation/) as business returns to normal.\n\n**Learn More:[4 Steps HR Teams Should Take to Prepare for Emergency\nCommunications](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/4-steps-hr-teams-should-take-to-prepare-for-emergency-\ncommunications/)**\n\nBusiness and HR leaders should also ensure they have a way to confirm\ninformation has been received. For critical updates, requiring an\nacknowledgment from employees can be extremely beneficial to ensure workers\nhave absorbed all pertinent information. The impact of\n[communications](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/whats-next-in-employee-communications/) will also vary across\ndifferent units and departments of the business. It\u2019s important to monitor\nacknowledgments across a cohort or team in order to understand how different\ngroups respond to different messages... Whether sending videos from the\n[C-suite](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/leadership-succession/how-\nhr-leaders-can-earn-that-elusive-seat-at-the-csuite-table/) or time-sensitive\npush notifications on the latest updates, HR professionals need the data to\nmake decisions \u2013 and act on \u2013 delivering the types of communication to best\nsupport, inform and engage their workforce.\n\nIn order to sustain their business through crisis leaders must focus on their\nemployees first. Companies that respond with transparency and compassion will\nbe rewarded by their workforce long after the crisis is over. While many\norganizations have a crisis management plan in place, the ability to deliver\ntimely, targeted and measurable communications is essential to execute on the\nplan, maintain business continuity and most importantly, keep your workforce\nsafe and supported.\n\n_**What strategies have you implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic?

While most countries have urged their citizens to not travel unless\nurgent, practice social distancing, and work from home - how organizations are\npreparing to keep their employees safe while ensuring business is going as\nusual, is something worth commending.\n\nOrganizations from across the globe are responding to the unprecedented\nchallenges that COVID-19 has created in multiple ways by trying to ensure\nbusiness continuity while controlling costs and managing people. Managing\nemployee experience during these tough times is also becoming a critical\naspect of how organizations are navigating through this crisis.\n\nRohit Thakur, CHRO, Paytm talks to us about the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, how\nthey dealt with the case of an employee that tested positive for COVID-19, how\nthey are monitoring the situation and what steps they are taking to keep the\nimpact to the minimum while ensuring their employees feel safe and secure.\n\n### Paytm was one of the first organizations to have a COVID-19 positive\nemployee. How did you deal with the situation? What support did you offer to\nthe employee? How did you ensure there was no panic in the workplace due to\nthis?\n\nWe have to understand that the spread of Coronavirus is a global crisis. It\nhas affected millions across the globe and a colleague of ours is,\nunfortunately, one of them. We took stringent measures and decided to shut our\noffices. Our first step was to communicate the decision clearly and directly\nto the employees.\n\n> Our organization was factual, authentic and transparent in our\n> communication, so when we announced the work-from-home model, our teams\n> appreciated the decision and jumped all in to make it successful.\"\n\nOur organization was factual, authentic and transparent in our communication,\nso when we announced the work-from-home model, our teams appreciated the\ndecision and jumped all in to make it successful. Questions and queries were\nanswered by leaders and teams locally and centrally. All offices across the\ncountry have been sanitized, sterilized and fumigated as well. We were in\nconstant touch with the family of the Corona affected employee to check on his\nhealth condition and offered full support to the family throughout the period\nhe was hospitalized. We are glad that the employee has recovered & is\ndischarged from the hospital now.\n\n### On a scale of 1-5 (5 being extreme, production getting halted and\nbusinesses facing losses), how do you perceive the current business situation\nin the wake of the COVID-19 crisis?\n\nA global crisis of this level cannot be quantified. The company has switched\nto the work-from-home model and we are adapting to new ways of working using\ntechnology and collaboration tools. In fact, our colleagues are working harder\nas everyone understands the gravity of the situation.\n\n### What steps are you taking in dealing with this crisis situation?\n\nNeedless to say that all business travel has been canceled. We have made it\nmandatory to work from home for all our employees and are also frequently\nsharing WFH tips with them in order to promote efficient virtual collaboration\nand working.\n\nWith regards to health precautions, we are also constantly in touch with our\npanel of doctors and reaching out to them for expert guidance and any queries\nwhich our employees might have.\n\n> Our business continuity plan is activated and all employees are enabled to\n> work from home remotely while ensuring there is no impact on our business.\"\n\nWe are encouraging employees to maximize the use of technology with tools like\nDing Talk, Google Hangouts, Video Conference, etc. to collaborate virtually\nfor meetings. Also, our business continuity plan is activated and all\nemployees are enabled to work from home remotely while ensuring there is no\nimpact on our business.\n\n### What policies and processes do you have in place for an infected employee\nor an employee whose family member(s) have been infected?\n\nIt goes without saying that every colleague of ours is important to us. We\nprovide them with all possible assistance and ensure that they are well taken\ncare of. Our comprehensive health benefits plan covers all eventualities for\nthem and immediate family members.\n\n### Who is handling crisis management in your organization? Do you have a\nseparate COVID-19 response team? What is the role of the team?\n\nAn Emergency Response Team (ERT) consisting of senior leaders from various\ndepartments of the organization is monitoring the situation closely so that we\ncan share real-time advisory & appropriate precautions with our employees.\n\n### Do you think the outbreak of COVID-19 and the crisis is impacting this\nappraisal cycle?\n\nWe are a performance-driven organization and our appraisal process focuses on\nrecognizing and rewarding people based on their performance. We are currently\nin the process of kickstarting our appraisal process as per our yearly\ntimelines.\n\n### How can employees better prepare for this situation?\n\nAt this stage, we are urging our employees to take care of their health &\nsafety as that is our topmost priority. Following our government's advice,\nstaying at home and social distancing is key.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [C-Suite](/category/leadership-\nstrategy/c-suite?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=c-suite \"Browse more in:\nC-Suite\"),\n[#COVID-19](/tag/covid-19?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=covid-19 \"Browse\nmore in: COVID-19\"),\n[#CXtoEX](/tag/cxtoex?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=cxtoex \"Browse more\nin: CXtoEX\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Yasmin Taj](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1532607622/authors/yasmin-\ntaj.jpg)](/author/yasmin-taj)\n\n#### [Yasmin Taj](/author/yasmin-taj)\n\nYasmin Taj is working with People Matters as Senior Editor.

The latest shift is the move away from a\n\u201ccompetitive evaluation\u201d model to a \u201ccoaching and development model\u201d, as the\nenterprise environment moves from an industrial economy to a knowledge\neconomy.\n\n### Managing continuous performance\n\nBusiness cycles are tumultuous and employee expectations are distinctly\ndifferent today. High performance depends on a variety of factors, from day-\nto-day work goals, continuous development, learning, and career growth.\n\nFrom an employee\u2019s perspective, the need to find purpose, and reach his/her\npotential is influencing how well he/she performs. On the organizational\nfront, the availability of data and digitalization is enabling data-driven\nperformance decisions with real-time data and insights.\n\nConsequently, there's now a need for a performance management system based on\na data-driven, flexible, continuous, and development-oriented system. This is\nwhat continuous PMS offers- a performance system which is focused not just on\nindividual employees, but on skills and teams.\n\nFrequent check-ins, on-going feedback, agile goals, innovation etc. resonate\nwith the VUCA nature of business. Continuous PMS makes it possible for\norganizations to fail-fast and move progressively ahead towards the strategic\nvision.\n\n> According to a research, respondents in organizations who have adopted\n> continuous performance practices outperformed or significantly outperformed\n> their competition at a 24% higher rate.\n\n### Designing processes\n\nConstructing a new process that reflects the people and purpose involves\nchange management, and must be approached systematically. Shaking the status\nquo and looking at organizational performance through a new lens are key\nprerequisites to apply design thinking to any process design. HR professionals\nmust hone their skills in areas such as technological prowess, talent\nanalytics and business acumen. The ultimate goal is to envision a PMS system\nand process, which is both employee-centric, and aligned with business goals:\n\n  * **Understand the problem:** HR must dig into employee data, manager insights, and business indicators to empathize with the end customer i.e. with employees and business leads. Today, a host of technological tools are available for data-driven insighting and decision-making, hence HR must build data-capability from within. \n  * **Research the context:** HR practitioners must clearly outline as to why a problem is important. Create a point of view about the context through research and observation. \n  * **Going beyond:** HR practitioners must brainstorm along with business leads on how to solve the problem. It is important to go beyond the business context, to ensure that the PMS design is in alignment with the business strategy. \n  * **Prototype:** Prototyping focuses on the \u201chow of creation\u201d. Once the vision is clear for a business-aligned and employee-centric PMS, it is time to start creating and experimenting through actions. \n  * **Test:** Final implementation of the PMS system shall answer the question of whether it actually works. For continuous performance management, it is important to define whether the PMS actually measures the desired performance outcomes which propel the business in the right direction.\n\nThe goal of performance management is to enable employees and managers to\nachieve the desired behaviors and results. Such a future-forward system can be\nentrenched in the organizational ways of working with the right cultural\nintervention. HR must educate and train employees and managers to adopt and\nembrace the new system on all fronts, such as technical usage and mindset-\nreadiness. More often than not, success is determined by how ingrained the PMS\nethos is in the employees\u2019 mindset.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Performance Management](/category/compensation-\nperformance/performance-\nmanagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=performance-management \"Browse\nmore in: Performance Management\"), [#Design Thinking HR](/tag/design-thinking-\nhr?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=design-thinking-hr \"Browse more in:\nDesign Thinking HR\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Rhucha Kulkarni](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1489129443/authors/rhucha-\nkulkarni.jpg)](/author/rhucha-kulkarni)\n\n#### [Rhucha Kulkarni](/author/rhucha-kulkarni)\n\nRhucha is a freelance writer at People Matters.\n\n[NEXT STORY: The Travel Risk Outlook 2020: How can organizations ensure safety\nof traveling employees ](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/employee-\nrelations/the-travel-risk-outlook-2020-how-can-organizations-ensure-safety-of-\ntravelling-employees-24331?page=2 \"Article: The Travel Risk Outlook 2020: How\ncan organizations ensure safety of traveling employees &ndash;

On the other hand,\nyou also know performance management challenges are widespread.\n\nAside from [acquiring great\ntalent](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/5-keys-to-a-killer-\nrecruitment-marketing-strategy) to begin with, there's nothing more important\nthan focusing the efforts of employees on the objectives of the organization,\nsaid Kevin Kruse, founder and CEO of LEADx, a Philadelphia-based coaching\nplatform.\n\n\"Are people working well on the things they're supposed to be working on?\"\nKruse said. \"And how can we maximize their effort toward these goals?\"\n\nPerformance management isn't only about presenting employees with their annual\nraises. It's about efficiency, productivity and profitability as well.\n\nYet, studies show that few managers and employees are satisfied with their\norganization's approach to performance management challenges.\n\nFor example, only 20% of employees believe their performance is managed in a\nway that motivates them to do \"outstanding\" work, and just 14% said their\nreviews inspire them to improve, according to the Gallup report \"Re-\nengineering Performance Management.\"\n\nAt many companies, the HR teams, managers and employees actively dislike the\nperformance review process, said Jason Renda, global senior HR business\npartner at UST Global, a digital services software provider based in Aliso\nViejo, Calif.\n\n\"Managers hate meeting with employees and providing [feedback] on an annual\nbasis,\" he said. \"Employees hate receiving it, [and] HR hates administering\nit.\"\n\nThe reason for all this sourness is \"because it's very rarely aligned to what\nthe business is trying to do,\" he said.\n\nTo better understand this complexity, here are five of the most common\nperformance management challenges and lessons HR can help the rest of the\nbusiness understand.\n\n### __1\\. Leadership buy-in and change management are missing\n\nThe majority of performance management challenges are people issues. That\nstarts at the top and extends to the most junior employee.\n\nTransforming the performance management process and implementing the\n[necessary\ntechnology](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/A-revolution-in-\nemployee-performance-review-software-to-loom-over-HCM) requires a C-level\nchampion, specifically an executive who understands how yesterday's approach\nto performance management challenges isn't going to help the organization\nsucceed in the future, Renda said.\n\nTransformation happens on the front lines as part of daily workflow. The most\nthoughtful strategies or capable tools aren't of much value if line managers\nand employees don't embrace them.\n\n\"If you change the performance management process without the change\nmanagement piece needed to [drive adoption and\nacceptance](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/podcast/Employee-\nperformance-management-shifts-toward-collaborative-engagement), it's going to\nfail,\" Renda said.\n\n### __2\\. Leaders mistake measurement for management\n\nToo many employers regard performance management as a measurement exercise\nwhen, in reality, it's about feedback, said David Wilson, founder and CEO of\nFosway Group, a U.K.-based HR industry analyst firm.\n\n\"It's about what actually helps improve performance,\" he said.\n\nCompanies must also include factors such as mission, improvement and other\nareas that raise performance levels for both individuals and teams into a\nperformance management approach, he said.\n\n\"I think the first thing we have to do is think about it more holistically,\"\nWilson said. \"It's as much about _improve and develop_ as it is about _manage\nand measure_.\"\n\n### __3\\. Leaders view tech as the solution\n\nEmployers can't simply implement a performance management platform and\nconsider their work done.\n\nAddressing performance management challenges requires integrating both\nprocesses and tools into the organization's workflow. That makes the\nimplementation of performance management technology a major transformation\nproject, Renda said.\n\n\"You have to work with the business to understand how the company and the\nbusiness is transforming itself,\" he said.\n\nThat understanding will help HR recognize the company's future workforce\nneeds, he said.\n\n\"HR has to understand where your organization's going and how it's setting its\noverall organizational goals and how the [talent would need to\ntransform](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/Fight-the-skills-gap-\nwith-a-great-upskilling-and-reskilling-strategy) in the future,\" Renda said.\n\nThis means it's a mistake to equate technology with performance management.\n\n\"The technology isn't going to do the job for you,\" said Todd Holzman, founder\nand CEO of Holzman & Company, a leadership consulting firm based in New York\nCity. \"You still ultimately have to have the conversation and have it well.\"\n\n### __4\\. Employees don't trust the process\n\nEmployee buy-in is just as important, and the key to earning that is\ntransparency.\n\nA common issue is that employees are confused about how they're rated. If\nemployees view the rating system as mysterious or unfair, it is unlikely they\nwill support the process, which is likely to affect other issues, [such as\nemployee\nexperience](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/10-ingredients-in-\na-killer-employee-experience-strategy).\n\nThis is true even if a system is\n[ratingless](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/corporate-hr-removing-\nperformance-ratings-is-unlikely-to-improve-performance/).\n\nSome employers have adopted ratingless performance management systems in the\nlast few years, Renda said. These reviews don't include any kind of score or\ngrade, or even descriptions such as \"excellent\" or \"needs improvement.\"\nHowever, many workers believe managers are rating them somewhere within the\nperformance management technology's back end. Only by educating them about the\nsystem's workings can you overcome that.\n\n\"You need to make sure that you explain how the technology is being used and\nwhat types of things a manager sees,\" Renda said. \"You have to be very\ntransparent.\"\n\n### __5\\. Managers aren't trained\n\nPeople are complex, and they bring that complexity to work. That means\nmanaging them and [helping them\nimprove](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/4-ways-to-create-a-\ncontinuous-learning-culture) are inherently difficult tasks.\n\n\"Most managers, by default, don't know how to do [performance management]\nwell,\" Holzman said.\n\nMany managers prefer to keep conversations comfortable and exert too much\ncontrol, he said. Organizations do need to create an effective approach for\naddressing performance challenges, but leaders also need to make performance\nmanagement a priority.  \n  \n\"[Organizations] have to equip and empower their managers to have fabulous\nconversations with their people about performance, and that has to be\nsomething they do almost every day, not just at the end of the year,\" he said.\n\n####  Related Resources\n\n  * [Using Financial Reporting Software to Improve Operations and Boost Profitability](https://www.bitpipe.com/detail/RES/1338834492_660.html) -SearchFinancialApplications\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on Performance management software\n\n  * [\n\n##### Empathy is key to driving HR technology user adoption\n\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/video/Empathy-is-key-to-driving-HR-\ntechnology-user-adoption)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Impact of HR automation shows up in data and surveys\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252473580/Impact-of-HR-\nautomation-shows-up-in-data-and-surveys)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Employee engagement in HR shapes performance and payroll tech\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/wallask_scott.jpg) By: Scott\nWallask ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Employee-engagement-\nin-HR-shapes-performance-and-payroll-tech)\n\n  * [\n\n##### HR automation, simplification mean less staff and savings\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252446305/HR-\nautomation-simplification-mean-less-staff-and-savings)\n\n  * [![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/feffer_mark.jpg)](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Mark-Feffer)\n\n[Mark Feffer](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Mark-Feffer) asks:\n\n## What performance management challenges do you think are the most difficult?\n\n__\n\nJoin the Discussion\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [Want Engaged and Inspired Employees?

are increasingly choosing regular \"check-ins\" rather than annual\nreviews to manage employee performance. But what is the best way to implement\nthis strategy? ****Emil Gigov examines the emerging technology behind\ncontinuous performance management (CPM).**\n\nAnnual appraisals have been disrupted by continuous coaching practices that\naim to improve employee engagement and productivity. Performance management is\nshifting from a centralised model facilitated by HR to a decentralised\napproach, which has increased leadership accountability. This requires\nsignificant cultural change in particular at the middle management level.\n\n## Continuous performance management\n\n**[Why check-ins are key to creating a healthy\nculture](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/why-manager-check-ins-key-healthy-\nculture/ \"Why check-ins are key to creating a healthy culture\")**\n\nThose organisations that compete for highly skilled and talented staff have\nthe most to gain from these changes and are at the forefront of implementing\ncontinuous performance management. The key question they have is how to deal\nwith the complexities introduced by this relatively new thinking. Inevitably,\nsoftware is providing the answer.\n\n## Technological revolution\n\nAnalysts predict that by 2022 more than 30% of organizations will abandon one-\nsize-fits-all performance management approaches in favour of approaches\ntailored to support the distinct objectives of various business functions \u2013\nincluding goals, objectives, check-ins and feedback.\n\nIncreasing the frequency of appraisals was not feasible in the past, largely\ndue to the labour-intensive nature of the administration required. However,\nover the past decade technologies such as role-based self-service, mobile\napps, workflow and role-based dashboards have made disruption of annual\nperformance reviews possible.\n\nThe cadence and content of performance management is now changing. The\nexpectation today is that there is an ongoing two-way conversation between an\nemployee and their manager, rather than a point-in-time evaluation. There is\nalso an increasing expectation that evaluations are shaped by additional\npeople beyond an employee\u2019s immediate manager or team. This process is closely\nlinked to employee development.\n\nIn a low-touch environment, where interaction is minimal, managers may be\nsynthesising information and feedback from multiple sources about individuals\nthat they may not personally know very well, leading to sub-optimal\nperformance management outcomes. New emerging technology solutions enable\nmanagers to do this efficiently and effectively.\n\n## Which model is best?\n\nAs performance management thinking evolves, technology solutions will remain\nsomewhat fragmented and transitional. Traditional human capital management\nsuites (HCM) are focused on the HR manager and struggle to engage with\nbusiness managers, who often see the performance management modules of such\nsystems as cumbersome and not user friendly.\n\nThis has created an opportunity for vendors of point solutions to provide\nsimpler to use, more engaging tools that facilitate frequent interactions.\n\nThe competitive battlefield for CPM currently involves three main categories:\n\n## 1\\. Traditional HCM or talent management suites\n\nAlmost every human capital management (HCM) suite vendor has been\ncomplementing or extending its performance applications. Enhancements include\nfeatures such as predictive worker analytics, personality assessments, peer\nfeedback, or mobile coaching sessions. Suite vendors are also building deeper\nflexibility into their traditional performance reviews by increasing options\nfor review frequency and/or ad hoc reviewers.The suites of tools on offer may\nnot be a perfect fit for every use case.\n\nHowever, the tools delivered by suites have the advantage of process\nintegration. For example, a manager can encourage development by assigning\nonline learning during a coaching session. In reality, CPM as a module remains\nonly a basic feature in the overall HCM suite. Also, the engagement profile of\nHCM suites (annual) and CPM applications (frequent) is different, highlighting\nthe different needs and use cases each are designed for. HCM suites remain\nfocused on the HR professional while CPM is inherently a business user\napplication.\n\n## 2\\. Worker engagement platform (WEP) vendors\n\nWEP vendors have emerged in the past few years, providing various combinations\nof capabilities and tools. Most platforms include manager coaching tools,\npeer-to-peer feedback, and goal/objective management. They may also include\nany combination of rewards and recognition, pulse survey tools, employee\ncommunications tools, gamification, manager advice, wellness and volunteer\nprogram management, or other tools.Analytics and integration capabilities vary\nwidely. While some organisations deploy WEP to complement traditional\nperformance processes, others have replaced traditional performance\napplications with engagement platforms as their alternative toolset for\ndriving and measuring desired performance results. This approach has allowed\norganisations to dramatically shift their performance and engagement culture\nand processes, while still maintaining a (less-rigid) structure that allows\nfor alignment, measurement and defendable management decision making.\n\n## 3\\. Point solution vendors\n\nPoint solutions are the opposite of integrated solutions \u2013 it is technology\ndeveloped to address one specific problem. A small number of specific CPM\npoint solution vendors exist today globally, each focusing on a set of\npurpose-specific functionalities including employee communications, feedback,\ngoals rewards and recognition. CPM point solutions have the advantage of rapid\ndeployments and a superior user experience, which translates into a\nsignificant increase in usage. Some vendors report an average of 70% of users\nlog in to their systems at least once a month. Those achieving the best\ntraction are seen as thought leaders in the CPM space, driving the debate on\nculture change and best practice. They also focus on the small and medium\nsized companies, where HMC suites are largely absent.\n\nAs different companies have different needs and different levels of maturity\nin terms of implementing CPM, all three type of vendors will be able to grow\nover the coming years. It is likely that CPM and engagement will continue to\nconverge and this will appeal to customers looking to reduce the number of\nvendors they work with. Those that can demonstrate a clear ROI, ease of use\nand high levels of user adoption will establish themselves as category\nleaders.\n\nThe best solutions may be the most simple. CPM technology which focuses on\nease-of-use and is well aligned with employers\u2019 key purchase criteria can\ndominate the market. Such technology is cost effective, allowing budget to be\nsigned off easily by a single HR stakeholder. As CPM evolves, solutions with\neasy implementation, a great user experience, demonstrable ROI and exceptional\ncustomer service are likely to gain increasing traction with employers.\n\n![Emil Gigov](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/08/EGigov-Website.jpg)\n\n#### About Emil Gigov\n\nEmil Gigov is a partner at investment firm [AlbionVC](https://www.albion.vc/).\n\n[ View all posts by Emil Gigov ->\n](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/author/emilgigovvc/)\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/low-skill-labour-supply-\ndown-a-third-in-two-years/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/give-workers-more-holiday-to-\nstimulate-economic-growth-report-urges/)\n\n### One Response to _Three ways to solve the continuous performance management\npuzzle_\n\n  1. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1b702d67152ff1faacc02af9ef7df88a?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\n\nLARRY W BRADLEY 14 Aug 2019 at 2:44 pm\n[#](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/how-hr-tech-is-solving-the-continuous-\nperformance-management-puzzle-cpm/#comment-63500 \"Direct link to this\ncomment\")\n\nYawn. CPM will come and (arguably) go, just like all other performance\nassessment systems have for the past 100 years (yes, Virginia, PM has been a\ntopic of discussion for more than 100 years now and will forever be).\nComputerized systems (AI, Machine Learning, HCMs, etc.) are nothing more than\nchanges in PM technology, allowing us to do more of what we have always done\nbadly, and perhaps making things worse overall. But, then again, it has always\nbeen about process and purpose, and not technology, hasn't it? A process badly\nplanned and poorly understood isn't helped by advances in technologies, it\njust becomes more pervasively onerous and hated. Typewriters did not solve the\nproblem, nor did word processors, pc's and floppy disks, nor will algorithms\nand supercomputers. In the end, the only true intelligence in PM or any other\nprocess is the exclusive domain of human beings. PM requires thoughtful and\nintelligent analysis, observation, recall and synthesis applied to\nindividuals, not massive data storage \"best guess\" algorithms based on\n\"averages\" and statistical biases. I appeal to the shortest and perhaps the\nbest article to ever appear in \"The Personnel Journal\" (The old version of\nSHRM's monthly magazine: \"If you want to know what motivates someone, go ask\nthem.\" That is the entirety of the article. Oh, if only we could figure out\nhow to apply that pithy solution to Performance Management.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply [Click here to cancel

Create \u2013 building a workforce that builds a better future**\n\n  \nIf we considered people management as a linear process system, it would begin\nwith talent acquisition \u2013 the building of effective teams. Knowing the purpose\nfor each team and every member within it is key to success. When you\u2019re\nbuilding teams, it is important to choose the right tools to do so. This\nbegins with choosing the right recruitment platforms, creating an employer\nbrand the candidates trust and want to work with and providing an engaging\ncandidate experience. Once you onboard the best-fit talent, the next step is\ntraining and helping them evolve in their skill sets to suit the changing\nneeds of the business. Investing in their development also builds more loyalty\nand commitment. Creating the right team structure also involves setting up\nprocesses, boundaries and a robust framework of functioning. This helps to\ncreate a roadmap to success and a functional plan to win.\n\n### **2\\. Comprehend \u2013 understanding the present and the future better**\n\n  \nEffective people management involves understanding the people who make up the\norganization \u2013 their personalities, motivations as well as their personal and\ncareer goals. Empathy, active listening, and a people-first approach lead to a\ndeeper mutual understanding of individuals and collectives. It is important to\nunderstand that people are different and have different traits and skill\npredispositions. The age-old technique of \u2018management by wandering around\u2019 has\nchanged over the years and while there are tech-enabled ways to mine data,\nspending actual time with people always leads to deeper insights.\n\n**Learn more:** [**What is HRIS? System, Model and\nApplication**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)\n\n### **3\\. Communicate \u2013 opening channels to connect effectively**\n\n  \nHow you communicate as a team affects how you work as one. Open channels of\ncommunication and feedback provide an effective tool to manage people better.\nThe format and culture of communication prevalent in an organization is also a\nkey element in the perception that an employee has of the larger picture that\nthey are a part of. If communication is important enough to control how people\nfeel at and about work, it is important enough to be a key criterion for\neffective people management. Organizations today need to ensure that they are\nproviding their employees with the right channels of communication and\nfeedback in order to encourage that they can communicate often, effectively\nand glitch-free.\n\n### **4\\. Collaborate \u2013 cooperating smarter, faster and stronger**\n\n  \nManaging people processes better involves acknowledging that work cannot\nhappen in silos \u2013 even for single-team-member endeavors. Success is a team-\nfunction \u2013 and so is failure. With the wide array of collaboration tools\navailable in the market today, organizations and managers can ensure that\nsharing and delegation lead to the best results. In order to add value to the\nprocess of work and to the lives of employees while also multiplying the\neffectiveness of the team, individuals need to be assigned responsibilities\nthat they can step up to and achieve with effective team collaboration.\nWorking with other human and non-human components at work also helps employees\nrealize the role that they and others play in not only granular tasks but also\nthe larger vision for the organization.\n\n### **5\\. Confront \u2013 optimizing on healthy differences**\n\n  \nPeople are different and in order to set a tone for respect, loyalty, and\ncommitment within the organization, people management needs to focus on\noptimizing these differences. By \u201cconfront\u201d here, we don\u2019t mean to antagonize\nbut rather to face, acknowledge and tackle these variations positively. With\ndiversity in a generation, thought, working preferences and actions, people\nperceive things differently and engage with issues with diversity as well.\nNow, this, more often than not, leads to assured conflict. The physical\nrepresentation of such conflict may either be overt and active or covert and\npassive. Resolving this conflict is an important part of people management\nsince it can either lead to resentment and negativity or strengthen the team\nand the manager has the choice with regard to which way it swings.\n\n**Learn more:** **[W](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-human-capital-management/)**[ **hat is Human Capital\nManagement (HCM)?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-human-capital-management/)\n\n## **5 Winning People Management Skills for 2019**\n\nWe may not always be able to articulate the difference between a good manager\nand a great manager, (or even those that could have been the inspiration\nbehind movies like _Horrible Bosses_!). That said, we are surprisingly good at\nidentifying these different kinds of people managers in our lives. How is\nthat? Well, there are key drivers or skills for effective people management\nthat we seem to pick up on rather easily.\n\n![5 Winning People Management Skills for 2019](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse at the key people management skills that can truly support\nthe team and lead them to succeed:\n\n  * **Trust-building:** When it comes to team-building, building trust is a crucial people management skill to have. Managers who inspire trust, make their team members feel that they have their back (not in selective situations, but always) and who allow the teams to explore risks within the span of sensible goals are perceived as enablers. The skill of being able to build trust is a long-term strategy and could engender a culture of honesty and transparency.\n  * **Empathy:** Whether it is with regard to planning work, assigning tasks, communicating or providing feedback, empathy is a skill that people managers cannot do without. It is the ability to be able to not only put oneself in another person\u2019s shoes but rather truly being able to see the world from their perspective and understanding their motivations, fears, challenges, and strengths. Active listening opens up the path to greater empathy by allowing a glimpse through the social and professional fa\u00e7ades that we often don.\n  * **Motivation-mapping:** A people manager needs to be an effective motivator. This is ideally a general progression from being an empathetic active listener and understanding the individual drivers of motivation. This skill is a culmination of a keen understanding of one\u2019s own emotions and those of others and being able to tap into that leads to better decisions, happier processes, and stronger bonds.\n  * **Appreciating:** Being able to appreciate right is actually a skill that needs to be mastered. An important aspect of managing people is praising and rewarding them for a job well done. This not only impacts how every individual perceives their work and the impact of their efforts but also how the organization in its entirety measures and reacts to success. The process of appreciation (beyond monetary bonuses and paid vacations \u2013 even a \u201cthank you\u201d goes a long way!) can lead to a culture of gratitude at work that in, would impact employee experience.\n  * **Knowledge-seeking:** In a world where data rules, knowledge is power. As a people manager, having access to the right data is as crucial as what you choose to do with it. How do you apply the data and build a knowledge and information base that aids decisions, provides insights and enables a deeper understanding of people and processes.\n\n**Learn more:** [**What is Performance\nManagement?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)  \n  \nIn an environment as digitally charged as ours, people management skills and\ntechniques need to evolve as well to live up to employee expectations and to\ncreate an experience that employees want to continue with\n\n**_What are the best practices that you have included in your people\nmanagement strategy?

the fore of employers' mind,\ncompensation should go hand-in-hand in their people strategies.\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | March 4,

[News](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/news/) |\n[Professional Development](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/professional-\ndevelopment/)\n\n_Josh Bersin is an analyst, author, educator and thought leader focusing on\nthe global talent market and the challenges and trends impacting business\nworkforces around the world. He will be speaking exclusively at the[ **HR Tech\nFestival Asia 2020**](https://www.hrtechfestivalasia.com/) in September 29-30\nin Singapore._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20594294_m.jpg)\n\nToday\u2019s organizations are very interconnected. People work in a more agile\nfashion (though not necessarily in the agile methodology), they lend a hand to\nother projects and teams, and their managers are less involved in their day-\nto- day activities.\n\n[Edgar Schein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Schein), former professor\nfor the MIT Sloan School of Management, once told me that the most valuable\ncultural asset for any company is the desire of employees to help each other.\nTherefore, we should be thinking about how we motivate and recognize people\nwho demonstrate this behavior.\n\nThe [traditional performance process](https://joshbersin.com/2018/11/we-\nwasted-ten-years-talking-about-performance-ratings-the-seven-things-weve-\nlearned/) is based on _individual_ achievements. However, research now shows\nthat the highest-performing companies reward people for team goals, not just\nindividual goals. Yet, fewer than one-third of companies do this.\n\nMost performance-management processes are also riddled with other problems.\n[Mercer\u2019s 2019 Global Performance Management Study\n](https://www.mercer.us/our-thinking/career/global-performance-management-\nstudy-2019.html) found that only 2% of leaders believe their performance\nprocess delivers high value, only a half have goals at the business-unit level\nand fewer than 3% believe they have excellent feedback practices. The study\nalso found that only 30% of companies rate managers on their people-leadership\ncapabilities, and only 9% reward managers based on their ability to lead\npeople.\n\nAs I learned during my seven years at Deloitte, the success of the\norganization is based on alignment, continuous feedback, trust and\naccountability. The Mercer study clearly points out that pay-for-performance\nis on the rise, and the top driver of success is a sense of fairness and\ntransparency in pay.\n\nI\u2019m seeing performance management again taking center stage, but this time\nit\u2019s all about sound goal setting, clear expectations, focus, feedback, growth\nand a fair, equitable and well-designed way of rewarding people. Additionally,\nthe HR-driven employee-performance process must be directly linked to business\ngoals.\n\nWhat do we do about pay? It\u2019s still very important, but in today\u2019s world, we\nhave to review it more often, adjust it based on market changes, and create\ntotal transparency in the process. I recently talked with an executive whose\ncompany does quarterly pay reviews for all major roles, and employees receive\ncost-of-living adjustments at least once per year. Patagonia aligns raises in\nbase pay for an individual\u2019s in-the-job performance and then pays high bonuses\nfor beyond-the-job contributions. Pay is an area with many opportunities to\ninnovate.\n\nFinally, the research points out that career growth is key to performance and\nrewards. The best reward for any ambitious person is a promotion. That may not\nmean a higher-level job, but it does mean a new, exciting, expanded role.\nCreating a talent network for career growth is key to the future of work.\n\nAs you think about your priorities for the year ahead, I strongly advise you\nto revisit the performance and pay practices in your company. I\u2019m just\nfinishing up a report on the management of technology workers. Our research\nfound that empowerment, clear goals, pay-for-performance and transparency are\nall key to high performance. In a sense, tech workers are the \u201ccanaries in the\ncoal mine,\u201d teaching us what everyone needs to perform better in this new\nworld.\n\nLet me conclude with an interesting observation from the Mercer research. The\nauthors claim, \u201cManagers, as we know them, will cease to exist and AI will\nplay a bigger their role.\u201d While I think this prediction is a bit over the\ntop, there is some truth to the statement. One of the biggest challenges I run\ninto as I visit HR teams around the world is the realignment and development\nof leaders to meet the management requirements of today. In this new world,\nleadership is not about setting goals and holding people accountable. I\u2019d\nargue that\u2019s the simplest part of the job. The primary responsibilities are\nlistening, coaching, advising, connecting and serving as the career stewards\nfor the people around you.\n\nTake a good look at your leadership model in the year ahead, and don\u2019t be in\nthe 91% of companies who don\u2019t reward leaders for the real role they play.\nEveryone is a leader in the future of work, and it is important in the year\nahead that we redefine what leaders do.\n\n|\n\n* * *\n\n| [![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/pink1.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/pink1.png)  \n---|---|---  \n|\n\nCatch **Josh Bersin** live as a speaker at the upcoming  \n[HR Tech Festival Asia\n2020](https://www.hrtechfestivalasia.com/?utm_source=hrmasiablog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=HR%20Tech%20Festival%20Asia%202020%20-%20Blog%20Post)\n(29 \u2013 30 September, Singapore),  \nthe region\u2019s largest HR technology conference and exhibition.\n\n| [**Get _your front row seat online\nnow_**](https://www.hrtechfestivalasia.com/registration?utm_source=hrmasiablog&utm_medium=blogpost&utm_campaign=HR%20Tech%20Festival%20Asia%202020%20-%20Blog%20Post%20Register)  \n---  \n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/blue1.png)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/blue1.png) |  |  \n  \n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fjosh-\nbersin-performance-and-rewards-in-the-future-of-work%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Josh+Bersin%3A+Performance+and+rewards+in+the+future+of+work&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fjosh-\nbersin-performance-and-rewards-in-the-future-of-work%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fjosh-\nbersin-performance-and-rewards-in-the-future-of-work%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

According to new research from\nanalyst firm Gartner.\n\nThough companies have been prioritising performance management improvements\nfor years, the research shows 81% of HR leaders are still making changes and\nexperimenting with their organisation's performance management efforts.\n\n\"One of the reasons performance management initiatives are failing is the\nincreasing demands placed on the outputs of the process,\" says Jeanine Prime,\nvice president in the Gartner HR practice.\n\n\"Today, organisations are relying on performance management efforts to inform\ncompensation, promotion and succession planning decisions, as well as to drive\nemployee performance, development and engagement,\" she explains.\n\nMost efforts to fix performance management are centred on reducing effort --\nthe Gartner survey found that two-thirds of HR leaders focused on making\nperformance management processes either easier or less time consuming.\nHowever, reducing the effort managers and employees must put into performance\nmanagement has significant negative effects.\n\nPrime says organisations that reduce effort usually do so by instituting fewer\ndocumentation requirements, eliminating ratings and reducing the number of\nformal performance management steps.\n\n\"Taken together, these decisions can cause workforce performance to decline by\nmore than 16% -- and diminish employee perceptions that performance management\nis worth the time and effort,\" she says.\n\nGartner research found that rather than reducing effort, organisations should\nfocus on increasing the usefulness, or utility, of their performance\nmanagement initiatives.\n\n\"Organisations that maximise utility by closely aligning performance\nmanagement with employee and business needs realised a 24% boost in workforce\nperformance and had a 7% higher proportion of high performers in their\nworkforces,\" explains Prime.\n\nIn addition, organisations with higher performance management utility report\n14% higher engagement among employees and a 50% higher proportion of employees\nreporting that performance management is fair and accurate, the research\nshows.\n\nGartner says to increase their performance management utility, organisations\nshould focus on three strategies:\n\n  * Customising performance management to the business\n  * To create a performance management process with higher utility, HR must enable the business to customise performance management to meet its needs\n  * To identify customisable opportunities, HR should consider the level of risk involved in customisation, including the impact on other talent processes or potential for bias\n\n\"HR should then consult with the business to determine which practices need to\nremain standardised and to support tailoring other practices, while ensuring\nperformance management still provides the input for critical talent\nprocesses.\"\n\n**Aligning performance management with employee needs**\n\n\"Employees need to have ownership over performance management design so they\ncan align the process with their needs,\" says Prime.\n\nOrganisations can enable effective employee ownership of performance\nmanagement design by reframing the roles of different stakeholders in the\nprocess:\n\n  * HR should shift from owners to consultants, providing expertise in talent management and project facilitation\n  * Employees should not be treated as consumers of the process, but as designers of performance management from ideation through rollout\n  * Senior leadership should become enablers who actively embrace performance management as an employee-led initiative and provide visible support without biasing the design\n\n**Adapting performance management to collaborative work**\n\nAccording to Gartner, efforts to use performance management to improve the\neffectiveness of collaboration typically fail as employees don't see a clear\nindividual benefit to effective collaboration and/or they don't understand\nwhat specific actions they need to take to collaborate effectively.\n\n\"Organisations can overcome these barriers by appealing to employees' own\nself-interest, first by showing employees that collaboration is a tool they\ncan use to achieve their individual goals,\" Prime explains.\n\n\"Next, leaders should communicate which actions, not just attributes,\nemployees must demonstrate to collaborate effectively. And finally, HR should\nensure the performance management process helps employees identify specific\nindividuals they must collaborate with and recognises employees for effective\ncollaboration,\" she says.\n\n\"Employees were four times more likely to say performance management was worth\nthe time and effort required when they judged its utility to be high rather\nthan low,\" adds Prime. \"When employees can see the value of performance\nmanagement, they're willing to put in the work regardless of how much is\nrequired.\"\n\nRelated stories:\n\n[ __74% of CFOs want staff to work from home permanently - Gartner\n](../../story/74-of-cfos-want-staff-to-work-from-home-permanently-gartner) [\n__SailPoint Peer Insights Choice for identity management\n](../../story/sailpoint-peer-insights-choice-for-identity-management) [\n__InterSystems named Peer Insights Customers\u2019 Choice\n](../../story/intersystems-named-peer-insights-customers-choice) [ __Infor a\nLeader in Magic Quadrant for warehouse management  ](../../story/infor-a-\nleader-in-magic-quadrant-for-warehouse-management) [ __Data visualisation\nmarket growing US$900 million a year  ](../../story/data-visualisation-market-\ngrowing-us-900-million-a-year) [ __IWD 2020 interview: FTS Group's Julia\nMerten & Veritec's Corryn Webb  ](../../story/iwd-2020-interview-fts-group-s-\njulia-merten-veritec-s-corryn-webb)\n\nDig deeper:\n\n[ __Gartner ](../../tag/gartner) [ __performance ](../../tag/performance) [\n__sales performance management ](../../tag/sales-performance-management) [\n__Human Resources / HR ](../../tag/human-resources-hr)\n\n[ ![Download\nimage](https://itbrief.co.nz/uploads/story/2020/04/02/preview_GettyImages-1172941151.jpg)\nWhy VPNs need more than a username and password  VPNs aren\u2019t just used by a\nhandful of users any more \u2013 now, contractors, vendors, partners, employees,\nand sometimes even customers will need to access your business VPN.More\n](../../download/why-vpns-need-more-than-a-username-and-password) [ ![Story\nimage](https://itbrief.co.nz/uploads/story/2020/04/03/preview_GettyImages-1067805214.jpg)\nBlackLine offers free finance and accounting services to help business get\nthrough COVID-19 BlackLine has made a number of its services complimentary as\nit looks at ways it can help accounting teams operate during the COVID-10\npandemic.

Author of \"Female Firebrands,\" Greenleaf\nPress, January 2020.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nTop talent is an essential ingredient for successful businesses, but one of\nthe secrets to development and retention is that it requires thoughtful\ninvestment from employers who are willing to give feedback to, coach and\nsupport their workforce. For many, performance management still means waiting\nuntil the dreaded annual review. But performance management should be a\nflexible and meaningful process that is about much more than just checking a\nbox. Good performance management engages the manager and employee in a\nmeaningful, thought-provoking conversation that's focused on the future.\n\n**Performance Management By Design**\n\nKnow what you hope to accomplish with any performance feedback system you use.\nConducting an annual review simply because it's what you've always done is not\nproductive. The review conversation must create value for everyone involved.\nExperiment with different approaches to performance feedback until you find\none that supports your beliefs and values as a company. Whatever framework you\nchoose, real-time feedback and genuine dialogue are best.\n\n**Performance Management Methods**\n\nAnnual reviews are just one way to think about performance management. For\nstartups and other fast-paced companies where priorities shift frequently in\nresponse to the market, infrequent evaluations can be impractical. Dynamic\ncompanies require the ability to swiftly identify what is and isn't working,\niterate and respond to unforeseen changes.\n\nOther options in your performance management toolkit may include:\n\n**Quarterly check-ins:** It's impractical to condense a year's worth of\nfeedback into one evaluation. Quarterly check-ins offer continuous feedback\nwith the advantages of a structured discussion framework. Employees will know\nthey have a chance to step back periodically and discuss their overall\nperformance and impact.\n\n**Regular one-on-one meetings:** Frequent, coaching-based conversations enable\nreal-time feedback and support employee development. Consider creating a\ndocument to track achievements, challenges and goals discussed at each one-to-\none meeting. Encourage your team members to do the same. This will also come\nin handy during formal reviews.\n\n**Manager feedback:** A true feedback culture means that feedback flows in\nboth directions. It can be difficult for employees to be open with their\nmanagers due to the power differential. Annual or quarterly performance\nconversations create a natural opening for managers to invite input on their\nown performance. This can be as simple as asking, \"What behaviors should I\nstart, stop and continue?\"\n\n**Self-assessments:** Any performance conversation should invite employees'\nself-reflections about what they do well and where they would like to improve.\nBonus points if you take the opportunity to ask whether your direct report\nfeels valued, challenged and a sense of belonging.\n\n**Preparing For The Conversation**\n\nPerformance management means building on strengths as well as managing poor\nperformance. Even if an employee is struggling in one area, they're also\nlikely to be doing many things right. Be sure to recognize their achievements\nand thank them for their contributions. For less experienced employees in\nparticular, gaining a sense of their strengths and how they are perceived in\nthe workplace is useful for developing their sense of professional identity.\n\n**Addressing Performance Challenges**\n\nBe clear on your intention and desired outcome before addressing performance\nchallenges. Are you giving feedback or are you having an accountability\nconversation? There is a time and place for each.\n\n**Supportive feedback** on performance challenges is offered with a spirit of\ncuriosity and a desire to see employees succeed. Have you ever worked in a\nfear-based culture or had a critical or impatient boss? In these environments,\nit is not safe to make mistakes. Imagine the gift it would have been if your\nperformance challenges had been approached with the assumption that you were\ndoing your best with the knowledge and tools available to you.\n\nAs simple as it sounds, a desire to understand what is getting in the way of\npeople doing their best work can transform challenges into success stories.\n\n**Accountability conversations** can help when clearly stated expectations\nhave not been met, or a line of acceptable behavior has been crossed. Your\ngoal is to clearly state the problem, the impact of their behavior, and\nexpectations going forward. You need to talk openly about consequences if the\nbehavior still doesn't change.\n\nBe intentional about which type of conversation you're going to have, and be\ncareful not to talk first about accountability before the employee knows\nthere's a performance problem.\n\n**Preparing Employees**\n\nBefore any formal review, let employees know what to expect. Be clear that\nreviews include strengths and areas for employee growth, and that you're\nlooking forward to hearing how you can better support them. Consider giving\nemployees an overview or a copy of your notes before meeting so that they feel\nprepared to discuss any uncomfortable feedback. Allow space for the emotions\nthat might come up during difficult conversations, and be open to changing\nyour perspective on employees' performance based on what they share with you.\nThere are two sides to almost every story.\n\nWhat's most important is that managers and leaders give and invite feedback\nearly and often, as a way to establish a healthy feedback culture.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Mikaela Kiner](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2019/01/Mikaela-\nKiner_avatar_1547665028-400x400.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/mikaelakiner1/\n\"Photo of Mikaela Kiner\")\n\n[Mikaela\nKiner](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/mikaelakiner1/)\n\nFounder & CEO of [Reverb](https://reverbpeople.com/).

management\nsolution](https://cezannehr.com/news/introducing-check-ins-goals-exciting-new-\nfeatures-to-improve-the-value-of-continuous-performance-reviews/) with the\naddition of Check-ins and Goals. Continuous performance management has been\naround for some time, but organisations have been slow to adopt it.\n\nCezanne HR has further improved its support of the trend with two additions to\nits employee [performance management](https://cezannehr.com/hr-\nsystems/performance-management-system/) system. Check-ins enable an increased\nfrequency of communication between managers and staff. It has also improved\nits goals functionality to enable employees to better measure progress and\nreceive timely coaching.\n\n## Better collaboration drive performance\n\nThe update provides a collaborative online forum where managers and employees\ncan keep their conversation going. Goals can be updated, added and progress\nagainst them measured. This data is then fed back into the HR system. It\nprovides managers with a single location where they can measure the progress\nof their whole team. It also allows them to identify those quieter individuals\nwho need support or praise.\n\nThe system allows both employees and managers to set the cadence of\ncommunication. They can also personalising their HR experience to suit their\npersonality at a given moment in their career. This is important as it enables\nmanagers to ensure they keep in touch with employees working on long term\nprojects. It means they don\u2019t have to connect as frequently as when they are\nworking in a new role and need extra support.\n\nJohn Hixon, Cezanne HR\u2019s Director of R&D commented: _\u201cWe\u2019re really excited\nabout this new feature. When we canvassed customers about what additions they\nwould like to see to Cezanne HR, better support for check-ins and agile goals\nwas high on the list of priorities. It\u2019s a reflection of how hard HR teams are\nworking at finding better and more engaging ways to support their people, and\nthe value they put on having the right technology in place to help them\nachieve their ambition.\u201d_\n\n## Enterprise Times: What does this mean\n\nThis is a small but significant update. Its success will be determined by\nwhether employees want to access an HR system as well as their daily work.\nIntegrating with Slack or MS Teams to engage on this solution might be a good\nnext step for Cezanne HR.\n\n> [How to Solve the UK\u2019s Non-Starter\n> Syndrome](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2019/02/18/non-starter-syndrome-\n> how-inadequate-onboarding-is-costing-uk-business/)\n\n\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [Cezanne HR](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/tag/cezanne-hr/)\n  * [Coaching](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/tag/coaching/)\n  * [Continuous Performance Management](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/tag/continuous-performance-management/)\n  * [goals](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/tag/goals/)\n  * [HCM](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/tag/hcm/)\n  * [HR](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/tag/hr/)\n  * [Microsoft Teams](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/tag/microsoft-teams/)\n  * [Slack](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/tag/slack/)\n  * [SMART](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/tag/smart/)\n\n[ __ Facebook\n](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enterprisetimes.co.uk%2F2019%2F08%2F20%2Fcezanne-\nhr-extends-performance-management-functionality%2F)[ __ Twitter\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Cezanne+HR+extends+performance+management+functionality&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enterprisetimes.co.uk%2F2019%2F08%2F20%2Fcezanne-\nhr-extends-performance-management-functionality%2F&via=Enterprise+Times)[ __\nWhatsApp\n](whatsapp://send?text=Cezanne+HR+extends+performance+management+functionality\n%0A%0A https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2019/08/20/cezanne-hr-extends-\nperformance-management-functionality/)[ __ Linkedin\n](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2019/08/20/cezanne-\nhr-extends-performance-management-\nfunctionality/&title=Cezanne+HR+extends+performance+management+functionality)[\n__ Email ](mailto:?subject=Cezanne HR extends performance management\nfunctionality&body=https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2019/08/20/cezanne-hr-\nextends-performance-management-functionality/)\n\n__\n\nPrevious article[Rootstock targets SAP backyard with\nEigenherd](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2019/08/20/rootstock-targets-sap-\nbackyard-with-eigenherd/)\n\nNext article[Pulseway makes brave decision on\n2FA](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2019/08/20/pulseway-makes-brave-\ndecision-on-2fa/)\n\n[![Steve Brooks](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2016/11/Steve-\nBrooks_avatar_1479512763-96x96.jpg)](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/author/stevebrooks/)\n\n[Steve Brooks](https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/author/stevebrooks/)\n\nSteve Brooks has worked in IT for nearly 30 years, working through different\nroles to CIO in a number of vertical markets including Finance, Manufacturing\nand Real Estate.

Organizational Psychology\n\n________ Share __ __  Print __  E-Mail\n\nSIOP, the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, has just\npublished a video examining how to update performance management practices for\nsuccess now and in the future of work. Presented by SIOP Fellow Alan Colquitt,\nPhD, the webinar video\"Big Ideas in Performance Management 2.0\" provides\nactionable, evidence-based insights for I-O psychologists, business leaders,\nand HR practitioners seeking to create better outcomes for workers and\norganizations through practices that foster engagement and strong workplace\nperformance.\n\nIndustrial-era performance management paradigms and practices are outdated and\nineffective in the modern VUCA work environment. Alan Colquitt sets the\ncontext for scientifically grounded recommendations for change by surveying\nthe current state of practice, and the ideas and forces that underpin it.\nAfter outlining several reasons to change these practices, he delivers\nstrategic and tactical recommendations for pivoting to a performance\nmanagement model that is both more effective and better suited to serve\norganizations and workers in the developing gig economy and the VUCA business\nenvironment.\n\nAlan Colquitt is a talent management, organizational change and human capital\nanalytics expert, with experience in several economic sectors. He is a\nfrequent speaker and presenter at professional meetings and conferences on a\nwide variety of talent management and human capital analytics topics. Author\nof the book, Next Generation Performance Management: The Triumph of Science\nOver Myth and Superstition, Colquitt was named a SIOP Fellow in January, 2020.\n\n###\n\nView the video on the [SIOPOfficial YouTube\nchannel](https://youtu.be/eLe4VJdbRCI).\n\n**\n\nAbout SIOP Professional Practice Webinars**\n\nPresenters in the [SIOP Professional Practice Webinar\nSeries](https://www.siop.org/Business-\nResources/Webinars?utm_source=Press_Release&utm_medium=PR&utm_term=Webinar)\nare subject area experts whose short, accessible video programs deliver\nevidence-based, actionable insights for workforce managers as well as HR and\nI-O psychology practitioners.

Yet it continues to be part of\nperformance management. This article explains the need to move past an\nantiquated manual process to an automated one that holistically addresses\nemployee engagement, learning, and performance,**_ _**Gal Rimon, CEO, and\nFounder, Centrical (Formerly GamEffective)**_\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834b324a1a1.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nI recently had a conversation with the leader of an e-commerce company. She\nspoke with energy and passion about how able her organization is at\nidentifying a great prospect or easily cross-sell a customer, literally as\nthat person is in the process of buying something else, or make a loyal\nconsumer hold an even stronger allegiance.\n\nShe went on a bit more on the virtues of blending data sources to learn more\nand do better\u2026all in real-time. Then a slight frown creased across her mouth\nfollowed by an exhale hinting at frustration. \u201cHow can I understand, manage\nand improve the performance of my employees with the same agility and\neffectiveness we\u2019ve been able to achieve in other parts of the business?\u201d\n\nGood question, and, unfortunately, one that\u2019s being asked by more and more\nexecutives. A very real reason that\u2019s the case is too few have embraced the\ncounsel of the brilliant entrepreneur Richard Branson, the man behind a\nplethora of companies all named Virgin. Simply put, he advises companies to\nput employees first, customers second.\n\nThink about it. Sophisticated data gathering, organizing and analyzing the\nsoftware that is used to do all that my e-commerce CEO friend described and\nmore can be found in just about every enterprise, regardless of industry\nsector.\n\nCuriously, the same cannot be said about tools and techniques used to improve\nemployee performance management, engagement, and coaching in ways that hold\nsome similarity to those handling customer-facing processes.\n\nCase in point: the annual performance review, a relic of another business era\nthat just can\u2019t seem to die, let alone die quickly. No less than the Society\nfor Human Resource Management notes that 95 percent of employees are\n[dissatisfied](https://slate.com/business/2016/01/kill-the-annual-performance-\nreview.html) with their companies\u2019 appraisal process. Yet it continues as if\nall are just fine. Further, the Workspace unit of Gallup finds that these\nreviews [do nothing](https://slate.com/business/2016/01/kill-the-annual-\nperformance-review.html) to motivate employees to do better. It also notes\n\u201cthe purpose of performance management is to improve quality of work,\nproductivity, and other business outcomes, but traditional approaches have\nconsistently fallen short.\u201d\n\n**Learn more:** **[What is HRIS? System, Model and\nApplication](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)**\n\nNot only are the methods wanting, so too are the relevance or applicability of\nthe findings drawn from such periodic assessments. While some organizations\nhave moved from annual to quarterly reviews, a manager is still likely\naddressing long-forgotten work issues. The employee doesn\u2019t get it. The\nmanager is ill-equipped to offer meaningful, actionable coaching. No one\nbenefits. And the top and bottom lines suffer.\n\nResearch and advisory firm Gartner reports \u201cmany organizations are reinventing\ntheir performance management processes by either de-emphasizing or eliminating\nannual performance reviews and introducing more frequent check-ins. These\nchanges are being made with the goal of improving employee engagement,\nproductivity, and retention. The trending belief is that traditional\nperformance management focuses on the past and that reviews occur too\ninfrequently to effectively course-correct performance or engagement issues.\nEmployees are actually demotivated by a performance process that seems to be\ndisconnected from their ongoing efforts.\u201d\n\nIf businesses are to embrace a software-powered method of assessing and\nmanaging employee performance and development in a way akin to evaluating the\ndemands and desires of their customers as well as realize consequential\nbenefits, they must consider the following:\n\n  * Evaluating different elements of an employee with different tools yields an inaccurate picture, impacted by the biases of each mechanism;\n  * Looking at the individual holistically, collecting, synergizing their relevant data offers a more complete, more accurate view;\n  * Knowing how an employee is doing at-that-moment, in real-time, changes a manager\u2019s discussion from a review of the past to a coaching session for tomorrow; and,\n  * In this age of Fitbit, the evidence is growing that today\u2019s employee, especially Millennials and Gen Z, is their own best motivator. When they can see what they need to do, and how they\u2019re doing it, they, on their own, step up to the challenge.\n\n  \nGartner observes companies have emerged that provide various combinations of\ncapabilities and tools.

We provide lessons learnt on how to make a\npositive transition, enabled by technology.**_\n\nIn our daily lives feedback is becoming more common place, facilitated by a\nrange of technology solutions. Social Media \u2018comments\u2019, \u2018shares\u2019, \u2018reviews\u2019\nand \u2018recommendations\u2019 provide insight, reinforcement and social proof.\nFeedback on websites such as Which?, TripAdvisor, Just Eat, Amazon and eBay\nprovide valuable data to help consumers make informed buying decisions.

It has been proven\nthat individuals within high potential populations demonstrate a consistent\npattern of requesting opportunities to learn and do new things, as well as\nactively seeking and using feedback. This enables them to deliver exceptional\nvalue to their employers and navigate future stages of their career.\n\nMillennials have grown up in a digital age where instant feedback is the norm\nand as a result, open two-way dialogue is welcomed. Both populations lack the\npatience for an annual appraisal process and the quality of ongoing discussion\nis key to maintaining their motivation and inspiring great performance.\n\nSadly, a body of research from organisations such as Deloitte, Accenture,\nAdobe, Microsoft and Gap has proven that the time, money and effort spent on\nannual ratings appraisal processes didn\u2019t achieve what it was intended to -\nultimately improve performance. Concerns about confidentiality, bias,\nauthenticity and accuracy have plagued the traditional model compelling a need\nfor change.\n\n**Learn more:[Best Practices for Switching from Annual Performance Reviews to\nMore Frequent Feedback](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/best-practices-for-switching-from-annual-performance-reviews-to-\nmore-frequent-feedback/)**\n\n## **Continuous Performance Management (CPM)**\n\nContinuous Performance Management is the practice of having regular, ongoing,\none-to-one performance conversations between a manager and team member. It\nprovides a shift in focus from looking at performance in mainly quantitative\nterms, to using both qualitative and quantitative data when discussing\nprogress, success and development.\n\nCPM is characterised by the provision of feedback, from a range of sources -\nincreasingly via a 360 feedback process - and by regular reviews and\nadjustment in priorities and objectives in response to changes in the\norganisation, market or industry. Through capturing the outcomes of ongoing\nperformance discussions, a large amount of rich, detailed evidence can be\ngathered which equips a line manager to more effectively track the ongoing\nperformance and achievements of the members of their team and confidently\ncontribute to any merit-based reward discussions.\n\n## **The key to success**\n\nTo ensure success, a transition from ratings to a feedback model should be\nviewed as a change programme with all the buy-in, communications, plan and\nsupport that such a programme requires. Considerations should include:\n\n  * **What\u2019s in it for me?** When positioning a new approach to your organisation it is imperative that a clear purpose is defined. Is the overall outcome designed to enable more agile ways of working, build a coaching culture, allow better career development, improve performance or increase engagement? By exploring these with your employees it will help to gain buy-in and provide transparency as to how the organisation will use the results and the benefits to be gained.\n  * **Strategic alignment.** A change in talent management practices needs to be clearly aligned with the strategic priorities for the organisation; Ensure that it is clearly written into your People Plan and that the change is properly resourced and budgeted for. A shift of this nature can often be undermined if there is a lack of clear commitment or role-modelling at the top of the organisation; your senior leaders need to be seen to be actively and positively leading the way.\n  * **Take action** \\- formalising action plans based on the feedback and reviewing quarterly shows commitment to those taking part. It also ensures the feedback is revisited and discussed regularly keeping the process alive, helping to embed it into the organisation\u2019s culture.\n  * **Test, Reflect, Refine** \\- start small by piloting your approach in key areas of the business to test your process and learn what works within your organisation and what support is required for successful change.\n  * **Create contagious commitment** \\- in addition to your senior leadership team, identify key stakeholders to act as \u201cChampions\u201d to promote its worth and usefulness as a management tool. These may be a representative staff group, high potential talent or well-respected members of specific business areas. This group would then define and promote the organisational need.\n  * **Business as usual** \\- For success, feedback should be accepted as part of everyday life within the organisation, for example is it a daily or weekly engagement? If the conversations are viewed as an \u2018occasion\u2019 or a formal meeting, the power of the authenticity of feedback can be lost.\n  * **Developing a feedback culture** \\- Creating a safe, open, transparent environment for honest feedback, both positive and negative will be essential. Despite the fact that negative feedback is usually more difficult to receive, this can be the most valuable input to drive learning and positive change to improve performance. Individuals must be willing to embrace the culture with a genuine desire to improve personal, team and company performance.\n  * **Manager training** \\- it is essential to train managers on both the process and the skills required to be more effective assessors of performance, manage their own biases and deliver feedback in a constructive, empathetic way. For example, raising managers\u2019 awareness of how their own biases and shortcuts in thinking impact on their judgement can help them to challenge these biases and make fairer, more evidence-based decisions about people.\n\n##  \n**The role of technology**\n\nIt is increasingly an accepted practice to use technology to give feedback as\nconsumers and to see feedback from others to validate and contrast our views.\nThis presents an opportunity in the world of work. Technology can support the\nchange by:\n\n  * **Delivering a robust process-** technology can automate, collate and interpret the data provided without laborious manual intervention so you can be confident that the process is running smoothly with minimum fuss, avoidance of human error and for maximum impact.\n  * **Offering a safe way to provide open and honest feedback** \\- reducing the barriers people may feel when providing feedback face to face.\n  * **Giving accurate, real-time information** \\- a good system will enable you to know that your new process and more regular check-ins are up and running - and taking place. Look for systems that have a range of analytics, dashboards and reporting options.\n  * **Providing a customised solution, bespoke to the needs of your business** \\- many systems can be configured to a look, language and workflow for each organisation. It is rarely cost effective to build a system from scratch, within the company. Find a system that is easily customisable and which benefits from continuous investment in development and upgrading in line with good practice, customer input, technological advances and new thinking.\n\n##  \n**The case for change**\n\nOrganisations who have made the transition to embed CPM and feedback into the\nheart of their business report many benefits. It can drive a learning culture,\nincrease motivation, improve performance and retain key talent. Change is\nrarely straightforward, there is comfort in a ratings system that is\nstructured, standardised and where employees are assessed using the same\nscoring criteria. However by embracing the technological and cultural changes\noutside of the world of work, business remains current. Open, honest,\nauthentic conversations engage employees, build trust and create an\nenvironment for all to succeed.\n\n**Learn more:[How to Give Millennials\nFeedback](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/how-to-give-millennials-feedback/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fhow-to-move-away-from-ratings-and-engage-\nfeedback%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=How+to+Move+Away+From+Ratings+%26+Drive+a+Feedback-\nBased+Approach+in+an+Appraisal+Process \"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [\n![](/images/share-icon/share-twitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+to+Move+Away+From+Ratings+%26+Drive+a+Feedback-\nBased+Approach+in+an+Appraisal+Process&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fhow-to-move-away-from-ratings-and-engage-\nfeedback%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fhow-to-move-away-from-ratings-and-engage-\nfeedback%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fhow-to-move-away-from-ratings-and-engage-\nfeedback%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=How to Move Away From Ratings & Drive a\nFeedback-Based Approach in an Appraisal\nProcess&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fhow-to-move-away-from-ratings-and-engage-\nfeedback%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Employee Engagement ](/category/employee-engagement/\n\"Employee Engagement\")\n\n  * [ ![20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/cover20freshemployeeengagementideasfor2020_5dd4e96253adc.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-engagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-\nengagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nAre your employees tired of the same old employee engagement activities?

'brilliant jerks' can have a damaging effect on teams  Image:\nShutterstock\n\n**Talented employees with a bad attitude can do vast damage to an\norganisation\u2019s culture, despite their job performance. Jan Schwarz outlines\nfour steps employers can take to address so-called \u201cbrilliant jerks\u201d.**\n\nAnyone who has worked in an office will recognise a high performing employee\nwith a bad attitude. Whether they\u2019re consistently delivering high-quality\nwork, dreaming up game-changing new innovation or completing complex projects\nin record time, their brilliance is hard to ignore. Unfortunately, in tandem\nwith their talents, all too often comes toxic behaviour such as dominating\nmeetings, intimidating junior staff or acting in naked self-interest.\n\n## 'Toxic' working environments\n\n**[How to take precautions to avoid a toxic work\nenvironment](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/take-precautions-to-avoid-a-\ntoxic-work-environment/)**\n\n**[Bullying in the workplace:setting unrealistic\ntargets](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/bullying-in-the-workplacesetting-\nunrealistic-targets/)**\n\nAny experienced manager knows how difficult it is to find and retain amazing\ntalent, but at the same time understands just how corrosive a bad apple can be\nto team morale and company performance.\n\nFor that reason, the brilliant jerk conundrum is one of the most challenging\nthat any leader will face. It is also one of the conundrums that is frequently\nkicked down the road until it\u2019s too late.\n\nBased on my experience advising Fortune 500 companies on their people\nstrategy, there are four key steps to consider when dealing with this issue.\n\n## 1\\. Detect with data\n\nOne of the toughest aspects of dealing with brilliant jerks is actually\nspotting them in the first place. These individuals are almost always adept at\nhiding in plain sight and carefully managing their reputation with their\nsuperiors. This allows them to slip under the radar.\n\nThe good news is there is a wealth of quantitative data points in\norganisations that can be used to pinpoint a potentially corrosive employee.\nFor example, is absenteeism and staff churn on the increase within specific\nteams? This can be one \u201ccalling card\u201d of a corrosive employee who is bringing\ndown morale and forcing your employees to vote with their feet.\n\nPerformance metrics of specific teams within your organisation are another\nstrong indicator. While a brilliant jerk can spin their own numbers to form a\npositive narrative, they can\u2019t do the same for the rest of their team. We\u2019ve\nhelped organisations to spot a corrosive employee by lining up the date they\njoined a team or got promoted to a managerial position with a subsequent dip\nin team performance.\n\n## 2\\. Understand the drivers\n\nOnce you have identified destructive behaviour in an individual, the next step\nis to understand what is driving the downward spiral. This stage in the\nprocess is all about understanding whether this individual has always been so\ncorrosive, or whether a change of some kind has provoked or exacerbated it.\n\nA logical first port of call is the employee\u2019s team leader, who will have a\nsense of any professional triggers that might have caused a behaviour change.\nCommon examples include a close confidante leaving the company, a new manager\nor perhaps even perceived \u2018positive\u2019 changes like a stretching new promotion.\n\nIf it\u2019s not a professional trigger, then it might be a personal one. In some\ninstances, a line manager will be aware of any problems outside of work that\nmight have turned a previously \u2018quirky genius\u2019 into someone more troubled and\ndisruptive.\n\nExtenuating circumstances like those listed above are not an excuse for\ninaction. Rather they are additional, critical pieces of data that enable you\nto build up an accurate picture of this employee\u2019s challenges and figure out\nwhether or not you can address their behaviour and keep their brilliance\ninside the business.\n\n## 3\\. Keep it objective\n\nEmployees that fit the \u2018brilliant jerk\u2019 description are often acutely aware of\ntheir own genius, but blissfully unaware of their flaws. Once you have a\nstrong body of evidence and an appreciation of the context, quickly resetting\nexpectations face-to-face is a critical next step to ensure the employee is\naware of the negative impact of their actions. But don\u2019t expect it to be an\neasy conversation.\n\nOne of the golden rules of disciplinary meetings is keeping as much emotion\nout of the room as possible and focusing on objective feedback points.\nHowever, this is challenging when the problem itself is subjective: how the\nemployee is making other people feel. The key here is to explain that although\nthese are subjective judgements, they are having an objective, negative\nbusiness impact: churn, reduced performance, low morale.\n\nIt is also important to ensure there are clear and specific KPIs with timing\nagreed in person and in writing after the meeting. This is particularly\nimportant with employees whose brilliance involves abstract concepts such as\n\u2018creatives\u2019 or \u2018innovators\u2019. These individuals often share a disdain for all\nthings mundane and restrictive such as KPIs, metrics and deadlines.\n\nEmployees that fit the \u2018brilliant jerk\u2019 description are often acutely aware of\ntheir own genius, but blissfully unaware of their flaws.\u201d\n\nAfter this session and in the weeks that follow, it will become clear whether\nthe employee has the will and the capability to make the behaviour changes\nneeded, and if they do, will give them a clear framework to follow to rebuild\ntheir internal reputation.\n\n## 4\\. Be decisive\n\nIf there isn\u2019t clear and tangible evidence of performance improvement over a\npredetermined period, HR leaders must move swiftly to performance management\nand potentially contract termination. This is always a difficult decision to\nmake, but they must remain strong and not be seduced by destructive\nbrilliance.\n\nOver a decade ago, Reed Hastings formally announced that Netflix\u2019s HR policy\nwould no longer support the hiring of brilliant jerks, saying: \"Some companies\ntolerate them. For us, the cost to effective teamwork is too high.\"\n\nMore recently, Australia\u2019s biggest tech firm Atlassian, which is valued at $47\nbillion, also put a stake in the ground by introducing a zero-tolerance policy\ntowards brilliant jerks in the workplace.\n\nNo matter how brilliant they are, putting up with a toxic employee always\ncauses more damage in the form of churn and lost productivity.\n\n![Jan Schwarz](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2020/02/Jan-Schwarz-Visier.jpg)\n\n#### About Jan Schwarz\n\nJan Schwarz is co-founder of people analytics company\n[Visier](https://www.visier.com/)\n\n[ View all posts by Jan Schwarz ->\n](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/author/janschwarz/)\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/covid-19-wetherspoon-\ntreating-coronavirus-like-any-other-illness/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/downfall-of-bp-worker-\naverted-after-appeal-victory/)\n\n### One Response to _Four ways HR can handle \u2018brilliant jerks\u2019_\n\n  1. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/46dfe6a02bc5dc3c5a3aaf0528d5af7f?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\n\nPerry Jameson 4 Mar 2020 at 1:23 pm\n[#](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/handling-employee-with-bad-\nattitude/#comment-85776 \"Direct link to this comment\")\n\nA tactical variation on a theme: cut off a brilliant jerk from going off on a\ntangent during a meeting by suggesting to the jerk to work up a formal\nproposal on the point of digression and promise to distribute it as well as\naddress it at the next meeting after submission.\n\nThere are only three outcomes and all three are good ones.\n\nMost likely, the jerk doesn't work up a proposal. The benefits of same are\nself-evident. In extension, repeat as often as necessary for reasons also\nobvious.\n\nNext most likely outcome, the plan submitted is a bad one and which will\nunderscore the fact that the jerk is a jerk.\n\nAnd finally, once in a very great while, the jerk actually has a good idea.\nEven better, it can then be used to keep the jerk busy for at least a while.\n\nReply\n\n### Leave a Reply [Click here to

An HRIS is often referred to an\nHRMS (human resources management system) since it aids in effective human\nresource management and planning.\n\nAn HRIS includes under its umbrella a wide range of systems. For example, it\nincludes all aspects of managing the employee database and directory,\napplicant tracking, benefits administration, payroll processes, work\nscheduling, time and attendance, leaves tracking, electronic signatures,\ncompliance protocols, customizable insight reports, employee self-service,\n**[performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)** , and HR processes taken care of on\nmobile apps.\n\nThis list, long as it may be, is not written in stone. It differs within both\nclient and vendor organizations based on the needs of the human capital that\nrequires to be managed, employee strength, the geographical spread of an\norganization, the basic protocols of functioning that it adheres to, and its\nmap for the future.\n\n**Learn More:[What is Human Capital Management (HCM)? Definition, Process,\nPlatforms (tools) with\nExamples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-human-capital-management/)**\n\n## **HRIS Processes and Working Components**\n\nAt present, all human resource functions are dealing with quite a data dump\nsince every interaction that a candidate or an employee has with the\norganization is captured and stored as data. A human resource information\nsystem thus becomes crucial in making sense of all this data \u2013 to not only\ncollect and store data effectively but to gather the information that would\nenable effective workflow and improve efficiency.\n\nMost HRIS solutions today offer customized systems based on the unique needs\nand growth plans of the organization. Let\u2019s take a peek into the six key HRIS\nprocesses and working components that most organizations require in some\ncombination.\n\n### **1\\. Database management**\n\n  \nThe core offering of most human resource information system solutions is a\nready-access database where all employee information can be stored and managed\neffectively. The HR team (or anyone managing the portal) can easily input all\npersonnel data into the system. The point is to be able to access all this\ndata and relevant metric from it on demand from anywhere across the globe.\n\nThe kind of data stored on the system ranges from compensation information,\nemergency contact details, and education history to present contact\ninformation, learning metrics, and performance review scores. The database\nforms the heart of all HR functions and could prove to be an effective online\nor cloud-hosted backup for a largely paperless office.\n\n### **2\\. Time and labor management**\n\n  \nMonitoring the clocking hours of every single employee is a time-intensive\ntask. With a majority of offices today allowing employees to either punch in\nbiometrically or log on to input their own hours, this daily dose of data\nneeds effective management.\n\nManagers can now approve leave requests, and the data can be directly linked\nto payroll. A non-intrusive but efficient human resource information system\ncan thus keep a close tab on punctuality and attendance.\n\n**Learn More:[What is People Management? Complete Process with Best\nPractices](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-people-management/)**\n\n### **3\\. Payroll functions**\n\n  \nPayroll is one of the most important functions of HR. With a lean human\nresource information system allowing easy download or upload of employee hours\nand attendance data, the number crunch can be made a lot simpler, and deposits\nto employees made more seamless. This also leads to fewer errors by reducing\nhuman intervention. Moreover, most HRIS payroll software lead to an\nimprovement in tax compliance, especially for organizations that deal with\nmultiple tax levels.\n\n### **4\\. Benefits management**\n\n  \nBenefits management does not pertain only to medical benefits and retirement\ninvestments, but all queries, feedback, data, and communication related to\nbenefits. Such applications provide a one-stop platform experience for all\nemployers and employees alike, add transparency, and enable smoother\noperations.\n\nEvery employee is affected by the benefits regulations and strategy, and how\nthat is managed affects the total experience that the employee has at work.\n\n### **5\\. Employee interface**\n\n  \nMost human resource information system software allows limited user access to\nemployees, but even that moderate level of employee self-service is a step\nforward in creating a culture where employees have more operational freedom.\nThe interface that allows employees to update their personal information,\nreview pay scales, change retirement benefit programs, update direct deposit\ninformation or download benefit election documents needs to provide a user\nexperience that is easy, integrated, and time-saving.\n\n### **6\\. Talent acquisition and retention**\n\n  \nAcquiring and retaining the right talent is how an organization can hope to\ngrow. With that context in mind, recruitment and retention are crucial\ncomponents of any HRIS and are ranked by most organizations as must-have\nfeatures.\n\nGetting the right talent onboard is just the first step to the talent puzzle.\nEmployees also need to be provided with the right training, career pathing,\nand reward plans to enable growth, boost morale, and create job happiness.\nHRIS tools can improve the candidate experience while also making it easier\nfor recruiters to source, track, and engage with the right talent.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Talent Acquisition Specialist: 10 Key Skill Requirements\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-specialist-key-skill-requirements/)**\n\n## **HRIS Models**\n\nNow that we have had a glance at the systems and working components that move\nthe human resource information system machinery, let\u2019s dig into the HRIS\nmodels that guide the functioning of its processes.\n\n### **1\\. Input and output model of a basic HRIS**\n\n  \nThis model enumerates the basic functioning of an HRIS \u2013 from input to output.\nBoth environmental and internal sources provide data for the input subsystems,\nwhich are then interpreted into information and used in recruiting, workforce\nplanning, workforce/[talent\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/), compensation, benefits, and for various parts of the reporting\nchannel.\n\n![Input and output model of a basic HRIS](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 1. Input and output model of a basic HRIS_**\n\n### **2.** **Model for HRIS adoption**\n\n  \nWith a plethora of options available in the market (to the point where the\nmarket seems overcrowded), choosing the right HRIS is a big decision. But once\nthat is done, to ensure that the organization has invested in a winning\nsystem, the right adoption of the HRIS is necessary. Here\u2019s a model that\nenumerates the different aspects of adopting the right HRIS and adapting to\nnew processes.\n\n![HRIS adoption model](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 2.

HRIS success model**\n\n  \nThe following figure is the integrated HRIS model for success. This is to\nreiterate how the users\u2019 perception of the system is affected by the quality\nof system processes, information access and application, ease of use, and\nusefulness.\n\nThe perceived utility of the HRIS is an interesting factor since it is quite\nsubjective and must make sense to the employee. All these factors together\ncontribute to the level of user satisfaction and ultimately to the success of\nthe HRIS.\n\n![HRIS success model](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 3.

progressive companies\nare increasingly looking at a 360-degree and around-the-year framework.\nPopularized by Betterworks, Continuous Performance Management offers immense\nbenefits in terms of efficiency, engagement, and data quality. We explore this\nin greater detail._**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834b324a1a1.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nContinuous Performance Management is a new way of looking at traditional\nemployee review structures. Instead of bi-annual or quarterly reviews,\nContinuous Performance Management lets you gather data on employee output from\na variety of touch points. This results in a more holistic and accurate\npicture of employee performance, countering the possibility of bias or one-\ndimensional data points.\n\n## What is Continuous Performance Management?\n\nThe concept of Continuous Performance Management was popularized by HR\ntechnology major, Betterworks. Their platform leverages data dashboards and\ncreative performance KPIs to provide businesses with a better understanding of\nhow their employees are doing, new ways in which to boost performance, and\nwhich areas need special attention from managers. CEO Doug Dennerline,\n[explains ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/hr-analytics/employee-\nengagement-toolkit-conversation-motivation-amp-feedback/)why Continuous\nPerformance Management makes a genuine difference. \u201cI see too many businesses\nlagging in meeting their growth goals and struggling to respond with agility\nto changing market conditions. They are struggling because they are trying to\nmotivate today\u2019s workforce with yesterday\u2019s outdated and ineffective annual\nreview processes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBetterworks facilitates the complex, continuous process of Performance\nManagement, with an intuitive, seamless and social end-user experience that\ndrives end-user adoption, and the customization necessary for each program to\nwork within each unique organization.\u201d\n\n_**Also read** : [Getting Leaders, Managers,\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-hcm/getting-\nleaders-managers-and-employees-to-buy-in-to-continuous-performance-\nmanagement/)_[_and_](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/getting-leaders-managers-and-employees-to-buy-in-to-continuous-\nperformance-management/) _[Employees to \u201cBuy In\u201d to Continuous Performance\nManagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/getting-leaders-managers-and-employees-to-buy-in-to-continuous-\nperformance-management/)_\n\n## 4 Reasons to Deploy Continuous Performance Management\n\nA flexible structure, as exemplified by Continuous Performance Management,\nenables agile goal changing as per dynamic business requirements. Team leads\nand organizational stakeholders can regularly specify the desired objectives,\ntake stock of personal employee targets, supply on-going feedback, and ensure\nan uninterrupted alignment between various requirements. This results in four\ntangible benefits.\n\n## 1\\. Better Quality of KPI Data\n\nBecause performance information is collected from various sources\n(conversations, check-ins, progress updates, network feedback, and social\nmedia) without undue dependence on a single person or parameter, the data\ncollected will be more accurate. Prejudice arising from isolated factors will\nbe eliminated indicating exactly how an employee is performing in different\ncontexts across the workplace.\n\n## 2\\. Deeper Engagement Among the Workforce\n\nWith companies across the globe looking to forge new lines of communication\nand strengthen employer-employee relationships, Continuous Performance\nManagement can be a powerful tool. Once a year event-based reviews are\nreplaced by a continuous line of communication; employees are aware that they\nare always being heard and their grievances/needs are being noticed by the\nmanagement all year round. \u201cCHROs recognize that motivation and engagement are\nnot one-time events for an employee. These need to be continuously stoked\nthrough regular, open, and ongoing conversations between employees and their\nleaders,\u201d commented Doug.\n\n## 3\\. An uptick in Performance Review efficiency\n\nProcessing employee reviews in bulk at every year end/quarter end can be a\ncumbersome task, weighing down on your HR department\u2019s workload. A Continuous\nPerformance Management framework constantly and consistently collates data,\ngiving your HR team uninterrupted visibility over key data. Furthermore, team\nleads are also aware of exactly where each employee is positioned at any given\ntime. As a result, reviews are processed much faster, without delays or\nerrors.\n\n## 4\\. An Increase in Conversation and Feedback Value\n\nIn a Continuous Performance Management feedback scenario, every survey\nresponse, questionnaire, and feedback mechanism is directed into the larger\nreview blueprint. This minimizes the waste of time and effort on the part of\nboth employees and employer. Additionally, knowing that their opinion would\nmake an actual difference, participants are likely to share more honest\nanswers \u2013 thereby improving data quality, as mentioned.\n\n_**Also read** : [Introducing Real-Time Feedback for Agile Performance\nManagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/introducing-realtime-feedback-for-agile-performance-management/)_\n\n## So how does Continuous Performance Management work?\n\nManagers and organizations start by setting specific goals that employees are\nexpected to follow. \u201cRecent research out of MIT recommends goals be FAST\ninstead of SMART, meaning they are embedded in Frequent discussions, Ambitious\nin scope, measured by Specific metrics and Transparent for everyone to see,\u201d\nDoug recommends. Next, 360-degree conversations across the workplace are\nconsidered to determine if the said goals have been met. This is further\ncomplemented by peer feedback \u2013 in fact, Networked Feedback is one of\nBetterwork\u2019s USPs, incorporating information from peers, direct reports, and\nother parties interacting with an employee, and not just a top-down\nevaluation.\n\nDepending on the results of the Continuous Performance Management process,\nemployees are duly recognized, and the platform is updated (dynamically) for\nthe next cycle.\n\nClearly, Continuous Performance Management offers a smarter alternative to\nexisting and arguably outmoded review models. Companies like Betterworks are\nalready exploring AI, ML, and Advanced Analytics to further amplify the\ncapabilities of Continuous Performance Management. \u201cWe will be releasing\nexpanded analytics for our customers that include highly visual workforce\ninsights, derived from their continuous performance management programs. We\nare also working to develop the rest of the tools needed to identify and\nmanage top talent, like next generation 9 block and calibration tools,\u201d Doug\nconcluded, looking forward to newer terrains.\n\n**_Are you looking to implement Continuous Performance Management at your\norganization?

the HR profession evolves, it continues finding innovative ways of tackling\ntraditional problems.\n\nUnfortunately, in areas such as [Performance\nManagement](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/performance-management-\ntrends-2019/), we sometimes open our toolkit and pull out the same old\nsolutions.\n\nFor many years HR has been stuck on a hamster wheel of annual reviews\nsupported by one-to-one check-ins and coaching sessions that rarely actually\nhappen.\n\nResearch from Gallup uncovered that almost half of employees receive feedback\nonly a few times a year, if that often, and less than a quarter of workers\nfelt the feedback they receive in those sessions is actually valuable.\n\nAt Collinson, we decided to take a leap and turn the traditional, ineffective\nappraisal model on its head. Instead of placing the process at the start of\nour thinking, we put the customer first.\n\nWe committed to first consider our people\u2019s needs and experience and then\ndefine how we would link that to increased performance and engagement.\n\nAs part of that effort, we changed how we talked about the entire process. I\nwas never a fan of the term \u2018performance management.\u2019\n\nWe have people in our business from 17 to 67 years old, most of them clever\nand very capable. Therefore, the need for close \u2018management\u2019 has rarely been a\nbig issue for us.\n\nSo we coined the term \u2018performance engagement\u2019 to more accurately reflect what\nwe are trying to achieve.\n\nTo help us realize our vision of performance engagement, we partnered with\nBetterworks to deploy a digital platform that could support a new way of\ninteracting with our people to encourage and support them.\n\nWe broke away from the annual performance cycle, including killing off the\nannual appraisal, which felt like saying goodbye to an old friend that was\nnever really much help.\n\nWe replaced it with a continuous performance improvement structure, whereby\npeople set and achieve objectives on an on-going basis \u2014  as one is completed\nanother one is introduced.\n\nOverall performance is reviewed every quarter in the same way, using a\nframework of structured monthly conversations on topics such as performance,\nwell-being, coaching or personal and professional growth.\n\nMy instinct proved correct. After moving to a continuous performance process,\nwe saw a noticeable increase in [employee\nengagement](https://www.hrmorning.com/news/team-leaders-drive-engagement/) and\nconnection to our organizational goals.\n\n## Lessons learned\n\nOf course, disrupting a process as entrenched as the annual performance review\nhas become, we had to learn a lot along the way, from how to secure executive\nbuy-in, to training managers and rolling out the program to our employees.\n\nHere are three key concepts we learned through the process that will help your\norganization gain the huge benefits of moving to a continuous performance\nmanagement process.\n\n### 1) Show employees how performance engagement benefits them\n\nI have never talked to ANYBODY who likes doing annual reviews Most employees\nand managers find them a bureaucratic burden, something which they are forced\nto do that they\u2019d rather avoid. And that\u2019s the best-case scenario.\n\nAt worst, they are[ demotivating, expensive and ineffective at their primary\npurpose of improving\nperformance](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2018/01/14/performance-\nreviews-are-pointless-and-insulting-so-why-do-they-still-exist/#16fafb0a72d1).\n\nOrganizations need to break this painful cycle. The great news is you can\nreplace it with a process that employees will actually demand because they\nfind it valuable to their career development.\n\nLanguage is a powerful tool in that transformation. At Collinson, simply\nrenaming the programs from \u201cperformance management\u201d to \u201cperformance\nengagement\u201d immediately signaled that the new process focused on engaging with\nthe talents and ambitions of each employee.\n\nThis forward-looking focus [not only reduces employees' anxiety, it boosts\nprogram\nparticipation](https://www.trainingjournal.com/articles/features/three-\nperformance-management-strategies-dramatically-reduce-attrition).\n\nAnd it can also have a positive impact on your recruitment efforts, as[\n](https://www.ddiworld.com/resources/library/trend-research/global-leadership-\nforecast-2018)the best candidates increasingly look to join forward-thinking\norganizations that are committed to employee development.\n\nBeyond a language change, it\u2019s important to communicate that a continuous\nprocess is more efficient than conducting annual reviews.\n\nWhen we first announced that we were moving from annual to quarterly reviews,\nour managers worried this would mean an increased workload.\n\nMaking the process more frequent made the process significantly lighter,\nfaster, less stressful and more valuable for everyone involved.\n\nI was able to show our executives and managers that, while our previous annual\nprocess required users to input data in 30+ fields, our new quarterly process\npared this down to just a few key questions.\n\nWhen designing our review questions, we kept asking ourselves, \u201cWhat does the\nemployee need to know?\u201d and, \u201cHow does this add value?\u201d\n\nAnother important change we made to benefit our employees was upgrading the\nperformance development technology we use. This is a critical step for any\norganization looking to improve their engagement process.\n\nCompared to the simple and efficient apps employees use in their everyday\nlives, many of HR\u2019s goal-setting and review systems are outdated, overly\ncomplex and cumbersome.\n\nWith [Betterworks](https://www.betterworks.com/) as our technology partner, we\nwere able to make it easy for our employees to continuously create and update\ngoals and for managers to provide regular and ongoing performance feedback.\n\nUpgrading our HR platform had an immediate positive impact on our\nparticipation and engagement rates \u2014 where less than half of our team recorded\ntheir goals in our legacy system, that rate reached 98% of employees in our\nfirst year using the new system.\n\n### 2) Start from the top\n\nResearch from management consultants DDI [found\nthat](https://www.ddiworld.com/glf2018/purposeful-leadership) those companies\nwho clearly define and then act on a sense of purpose outperformed financial\nmarkets by 42%. But that doesn\u2019t happen without hard work and ongoing\ncommitment.\n\nConnecting individual effort to an organization\u2019s mission requires continuous\nalignment and re-alignment of everyone\u2019s work within the organization to\nencourage and sustain the levels of engagement needed for higher performance.\n\nHR must help senior executives see the connection between employees\u2019 alignment\nto goals and both increased employee engagement and better performance.\n\nAnd that requires [speaking their\nlanguage](https://www.hrmorning.com/news/get-c-level-buy-in-for-plan-\nchanges-3-pt-strategy/). You want to tie the effort of moving to a continuous\nprocess to the very real business outcomes senior leaders are looking to\nachieve.\n\nThen, once you have the senior staff on board, move your focus to the\nindividuals who have the greatest impact on your workforces\u2019 overall\nperformance: your people managers.\n\nAt Collinson, we provided on-site group training for our managers and also\ntrained people at each location to act as local champions.\n\nWe encouraged friendly competition among employees and managers to boost\ninitial adoption, sharing leaderboards showing which regions had the highest\ngoal completion rates.\n\n### 3) Have a plan, but stay agile and open to learning\n\nOnce you get the buy-in and the budget to implement a new Continuous\nPerformance Management process, it will be tempting to go all in and try to\nroll out everything at once.\n\nBut it is more critical that your workforce and the business to start seeing\nvalue as quickly as possible.\n\nWe learned from our rollout that it is better to get started quickly with just\none or two elements of the program and allow time for everyone to learn and\nadapt to the new process and platform.\n\nAs leadership, management and employees see immediate value from the program,\nyou\u2019ll acheive higher, and faster,  adoption.\n\nThis agile approach to rolling out continuous performance management also\nencourages feedback from your managers which you can use to refine the\nprocess.\n\nAnd when people know their ideas are being acted on they are more engaged in\nworking with and sharing their opinons about how to improve the process.\n\nWe've now reached the point where, if a manager isn\u2019t coming to HR with\nsuggestions about how we can make our performance engagement process even\nbetter, we wonder if he or she is paying close enough attention.\n\nAnd we are getting ideas from all the way up our organization. When you get\nfocused, direct feedback from your CEO and can act upon it, you know that you\nare making real progress.\n\nWith quarterly reviews successfully in place and evolving, we\u2019ve created a\nroadmap for the next year.\n\nWe\u2019ll encourage people to start setting specific quarterly goals and introduce\nadded value to the process, such as marking International Mental Health Week\nby releasing wellbeing conversations and integrating 360-degree reviews into\nour processes.\n\nOther factors will impact your organization\u2019s ability to implement a\ncontinuous performance process successfully, but I believe the above three are\nthe most important because each one influences the others.\n\n## A feedback loop for continuous performance improvement\n\nLeadership buy-in helps with employee engagement and ensures leaders\ncontribute to the evolution of the process.\n\nEngaged managers will also provide [feedback\n](https://www.hrmorning.com/news/new-research-highlights-key-to-successful-\nfeedback-and-performance-management/)on the process and their enthusiasm will\nbe picked up by employees, enhancing everyone\u2019s appreciation of the benefits\nof a continuous approach.\n\nFinally, an agile process helps with early adoption and engagement because\npeople don\u2019t expect a perfect system, and it\u2019s easier for leadership to back\nan idea that will deliver results quickly. It also enables you to learn\nquickly and apply for improvement, which has been key to our success so far.\n\nBy transitioning to a Continuous Performance Management model, HR teams can\nposition individual employees and the entire organization for success.\n\nJust remember to keep your focus on creating a process that delivers inherent\nvalue for employees, provides more frequent opportunities for communication\nacross all levels of your business, and leaves room for ongoing innovation and\nrefinement.\n\n![Simon Gosling, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Simon\nGosling, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Simon\nGosling, HR Expert Contributor](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/gosling-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Simon Gosling, HR Expert\nContributor](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/sgosling/)\n\nSimon Gosling is the Director of People EMEIA and APAC at [Collinson\nGroup](https://www.collinsongroup.com/en-us).

Other new features as\npart of the extension include the ability for employees to either freely or\nanonymously submit ideas, praise or concerns via a virtual suggestion box - an\naddition that promotes more regular and more meaningful conversations in an\nenvironment where employees can feel psychologically safe.\n\nClear Review CEO, Stuart Hearn, said: \u201cFor an organisation to reach high\nperformance, it first has to have motivated and engaged employees. Engagement\nand performance are still largely talked about as separate entities in the HR\nworld yet the two are inextricably linked. Extensive research shows that work\nengagement is the single biggest performance differentiator, so the two have\nto be looked at in conjunction.\u201d\n\nHearn continued: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the rise of the purist engagement survey in\nrecent years, but these haven\u2019t solved the ongoing stagnation that many of the\nworld\u2019s largest economies are experiencing in performance and productivity\nterms. The real value in engagement lies in how it affects performance and\nproductivity. If we want to unlock sustained high performance, we need to\nstart asking people the right questions at the right frequency.\u201d\n\nClear Review\u2019s renewed solution has been developed in collaboration with\nrenowned workplace psychologist Ian MacRae, who added: \u201cClear Review has\ndeveloped a game-changing technology platform that, for the first time, puts\nthe focus firmly on benefitting employees and motivating them to perform\nrather than just capturing static engagement data that delivers no meaningful\nresults.

By allowing them\nto automate key tasks, providing seamless access to data and information, and\nfacilitating the creation of analytics-based insights, HCM technology can\nenhance an HR team\u2019s efforts to attract and retain talent, engage and\ncommunicate with employees, and streamline payroll and benefits processes.\n\nBut if HCM technology is so great, then why aren\u2019t more companies realizing\ngame-changing benefits from implementing it? The answer lies in these\ncompanies\u2019 implementation processes, not in the technology itself. Too often,\nHR leaders approach these implementations as technology projects. Instead,\nthey need to approach them as overhauls of business processes. Here are three\nguiding principles companies should follow as they seek to maximize the\nreturns on their investments in HCM technology.\n\n### **1\\. Plan ahead to ensure organizational readiness**\n\n  \nLack of organizational readiness before an HCM technology implementation is\none of the main reasons companies end up disappointed with their systems. As\nwe\u2019ve noted, a company must view a technology implementation as a business\nprocess redesign. To effectively execute this business process redesign, HR\nleaders must lay the proper groundwork.\n\nFirst, consider the selection of the technology platform. When a company\ncompares different platforms, it should focus first and foremost on how the\ntechnology will help it achieve its sought-after process improvements and meet\nits business goals. When solutions were largely on-premises, it was easier to\ncustomize features and functionality. Today, however, technology vendors\ndeliver more standardized solutions in the cloud. If an organization completes\nproper due diligence during the selection process, most of the features it\nneeds are going to be in the HCM platform it selects. So, a fixation on\nfeatures is largely fruitless. Instead, HR leaders need to more heavily weight\na system\u2019s usability. Leaders should be asking things like:\n\n  * Will the system help us improve talent acquisition efforts and even automate some of these processes?\n  * Will users from across the company \u2013 beyond the HR team \u2013 be able to interact with the system easily?\n\n  \nReorienting the focus away from features and functionality and toward\nusability and business goals will help HR leaders select the right platform\nfor their organization\u2019s needs.\n\nAnother key piece of organizational readiness is securing executive support.\nHR leaders must make a clear business case for the technology and outline the\nexpected benefits of the project to company leaders. This effort will help the\nHR team recruit an executive sponsor who can publicly make the case for the\ninitiative across the organization, which will help smooth implementation.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is HRIS? System, Model and\nApplication](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)**\n\n### **2\\. Focus on processes before implementation**\n\n  \nIf an HR team does not redesign its processes alongside the technology\nimplementation, it will severely limit the benefits it can realize from its\nnew HCM system. Essentially, the team will plop a new technology platform on\ntop of outdated processes. To take full advantage of these modern systems,\nit\u2019s crucial to also modernize business processes.\n\nStart with thorough process documentation, which includes outlining the HR\nprocesses the team uses currently. Then, determine how to best leverage the\ncapabilities of the new system to complete HR processes more efficiently and\neffectively. Performing this thorough audit and charting out new processes\nbefore beginning a technology implementation will pay dividends once the\ncompany goes live with the technology. By investing more time in the planning\nand process redesign phases, the company will reduce the amount of post-\ndeployment changes it will need to make. The company will also make the\ntransition easier on its employees.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Optimize the Employee Life-cycle with HR\nTechnology](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/compensation-benefits/how-\nto-optimize-the-employee-lifecycle-with-hr-technology/)**\n\n### **3\\. Manage change effectively**\n\n  \nA critical determinant of the success or failure of an HCM technology\nimplementation is how well HR leaders manage change. Embracing new technology\nand processes requires employees to alter behaviors in sometimes disruptive\nways. Therefore, HR leaders must offer both thorough technical training on the\nins and outs of the new system as well as immersive training on the new\nbusiness processes.\n\nCompanies must be willing to devote significant time and resources to this\npiece of the project. After all, for the team to realize the anticipated\nefficiency gains, all employees need to embrace the new processes and\ntechnology. HR leaders should secure employees\u2019 buy-in by making clear that\nthey made the process and technology changes to improve the team\u2019s\nproductivity and free employees from rote, manual processes. In the end, these\nchanges should enable employees to perform higher-value \u2013 and ultimately more\nrewarding \u2013 work.\n\nAfter all the effort HR leaders put into preparing for implementation and then\ncarrying out the implementation, it\u2019s crucial that they finish the job by\ndevoting time and energy to effective change management.\n\n## **Run toward the transformative benefits of HCM technology**\n\nThe fact that some HR teams fail to realize the full benefits of HCM\ntechnology shouldn\u2019t scare others off. HCM technology today can supercharge an\nHR team\u2019s effectiveness \u2013 but only if HR leaders lay the proper groundwork and\nview the technology as a key component of business process optimization. The\ncompanies that do prioritize organizational readiness, process refinement and\nchange management will enjoy smooth and rewarding implementations \u2013 and\ncapitalize on the many transformative benefits of HCM technology.\n\n**Learn More:[3 Ways HR Technology Builds Workplace\nTrust](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/3-ways-hr-technology-\nbuilds-workplace-trust/)**\n\n[![Bill Larkin](/images/ajax-loader.png)](https://www.sikich.com/team/bill-\nlarkin/)\n\n## **Co-author:**\n\n[Bill Larkin](https://www.sikich.com/team/bill-larkin/) has extensive\nknowledge of the Human Capital Management (HCM) technology industry and its\neffect on business results.

Stripped down performance management module works the way more\ncompanies are running employee reviews. Easy to get up and running. Open API\nmakes it easy to integrate with existing human resource tech vendors.\n\n **Cons:** Priced higher than many competitors. Doesn't include the benefits\nadministration offered by its biggest rival.\n\n **Bottom Line:** Human resources (HR) software and management system BambooHR\nis not the cheapest option but you get what you pay for, namely, well-\norganized, visually appealing tools that are simple to set up and run. An open\nAPI allows the software to be integrated with a company's existing HR tech\nvendors, and the performance review function fits with the way more companies\nare working.\n\n[Read Review](https://au.pcmag.com/cloud-services-1/44056/bamboohr)\n\n  * ### [Fairsail HRMS](https://au.pcmag.com/fairsail-hrms)\n\n**** $ 9.00\n\n **Pros:** Highly configurable. Accommodates companies with multinational\noperations. Offers applicant tracking and other add-ons. Integrates with\nthird-party payroll and other outside vendors.\n\n **Cons:** Notably expensive. Significant configurability means probably\nlengthy setup time. Built on Salesforce Force.com technology platform, which\nis a plus for existing Salesforce users but a potential minus for everyone\nelse.\n\n **Bottom Line:** Fairsail HRMS is a solid HR management suite suitable for\nlarger companies with foreign operations, a need to design people functions to\nmatch how they do business, and a budget to pay for this sophisticated level\nof configurability.\n\n[Read Review](https://au.pcmag.com/cloud-services-1/41881/sage-business-cloud-\npeople)\n\n  * ### [Namely](https://au.pcmag.com/namely)\n\n**** $ 12.00\n\n **Pros:** Highly configurable. Aesthetically pleasing user interface.\nIncludes all key HR functionality and then some.\n\n **Cons:** Very expensive, even without including a separate, fee-based\npayroll and benefits administration module. Implementation time could take up\nto 8-10 weeks.\n\n **Bottom Line:** Namely is a rock-solid option for mid-sized and larger\ncompanies that need an all-in-one HR management tool, and are willing to trade\na longer implementation time and higher price for enterprise-grade\ncustomization and flexibility.\n\n[Read Review](https://au.pcmag.com/cloud-services-1/41882/namely)\n\n  * ### [SuccessFactors Perform and Reward](https://au.pcmag.com/successfactors-perform-and-reward)\n\n**** $ 85.00\n\n **Pros:** This is the Cadillac of HR software for small to midsize businesses\n(SMBs), providing setup wizards, video tutorials, and other help features to\nwalk new users through what can be a complicated setup experience. Fast-\ngrowing companies can migrate to SuccessFactors' enterprise-level offering.\n\n **Cons:** More expensive than comparable HR software for small businesses,\nespecially considering it doesn't include add-ons that rivals offer.\n\n **Bottom Line:** Human resources (HR) software and management system\nSuccessFactors Perform and Reward is a fairly expensive solution for companies\nthat want a big-name vendor, lots of hand holding, and it's also good for\nfast-growth companies that want something that'll expand as they do.\n\n[Read Review](https://au.pcmag.com/cloud-services-1/45101/sap-successfactors)\n\n  * ### [Cezanne OnDemand](https://au.pcmag.com/cezanne-ondemand)\n\n**** $ 2.00\n\n **Pros:** Covers essential human resources (HR) functions such as personnel\nfiles, directories, and org charts. Main dashboard can be organized to display\nusers' most frequently accessed functions. Offers support for 10 languages and\nmultiple currencies, making it useful for companies with offices around the\nglobe. Loaded with reports. Android and iPhone apps available.\n\n **Cons:** A wealth of functions and unintuitive command structure make it\nmore complicated to navigate than other HR software. Lacks benefits\nadministration and payroll, though can export data to third-party providers.\nU.S. version doesn't offer a recruiting module that is available to European\nusers.\n\n **Bottom Line:** Human resources (HR) software and management system Cezanne\nOnDemand is solid software which offers most HR functions that can grow along\nwith a small business, but the user interface and multitude of options makes\nit tough for administrator-level users to get started.\n\n[Read Review](https://au.pcmag.com/cloud-services-1/44058/cezanne-hr)\n\n  * ### [Deputy](https://au.pcmag.com/deputy)\n\n**** $ 1.00\n\n **Pros:** Good option for managing shift workers. Reasonable price. Mobile-\nfirst design so virtually all manager and employee functions are available via\nportable devices.\n\n **Cons:** Shift emphasis is probably overkill for companies with\npredominately salaried workers. Doesn't include recruiting or payroll modules.\n\n **Bottom Line:** An option for businesses whose main concern is managing a\nlot of shift workers, Deputy has a nice price but lacks functionality included\nin many other HR management packages, although you can integrate it with\nthird-party offerings via the company's API.\n\n[Read Review](https://au.pcmag.com/cloud-services-1/41884/deputy)\n\n  * ### [Kronos SaaShr](https://au.pcmag.com/kronos-saashr)\n\n**** $ 3.00\n\n **Pros:** Includes applications expected from enterprise-class suites\nincluding payroll, applicant tracking, and performance review. Reasonably\npriced.\n\n **Cons:** Extreme configurability introduces complexity that might be a\nproblem for SMBs. Not as user-friendly as some competitors. Companies with\nfewer than 100 employees must buy through third-party partners.\n\n **Bottom Line:** Kronos SaaShr is a highly configurable, reasonably priced,\nall-in-one HR management suite for SMBs. It combines a high degree of\ncustomizability with a near-enterprise feature set for a nice initial price.\n\n[Read Review](https://au.pcmag.com/cloud-services-1/41885/kronos-workforce-\nready)\n\n## What Is Performance Management Software?\n\nHuman resources (HR) departments help companies find the best fit for their\nopen positions. Today's work environment is more competitive than ever, and HR\nprofessionals constantly need to attract, retain, and manage new employees\nwell so that they and the business can thrive. This is where [HR\nsoftware](/cloud-services-1/41880/the-best-hr-software) solutions can assist,\nhelping HR pros with tasks like [applicant tracking](/cloud-\nservices-1/48922/the-best-applicant-tracking-systems) (AT), benefits\nadministration (BA), [payroll](/accounting-tax-software/40768/the-best-online-\npayroll-software), and performance management (PM), training, to name a few.\nAs a result of using great HR tools, the workforce can be supported and the\ncompany can be better organized and productive.\n\nStandalone PM software solutions and services do exist but integrated\nsolutions that work in conjunction with various HR tools make more sense for\nsmall to midsize businesses (SMBs). Integrated solutions generally cost less,\nand employee performance can be tracked and also reflected in other\ncomponents. Most notably for payroll for bonuses and compensation as well as\ntraining for certification and skills advancement.\n\n## **Comparing Performance Management Software**\n\nWhile we have two Editors' Choice winners in the features table above; it's\nimportant to note that [BambooHR](/cloud-services-1/44056/bamboohr) is a\nholdover from our recent review of all-around HR software and management\nsystems. However, its Editors' Choice award also stands in this PM category.\nBambooHR did an exceptional job of integrating a thorough PM feature set into\na well-rounded, intuitive HR platform that's easily accessible by SMB\noperators. Along the same lines, Deputy is the best scheduling tool on the\nmarket but it's not primarily a PM tool. However, Deputy offers enough solid\nPM functionality that it warrants consideration, especially if scheduling and\nPM go hand in hand within your organization.\n\nA new Editors' Choice award solely for the PM category goes to [SAP\nSuccessFactors](/cloud-services-1/45101/sap-successfactors). This is a\nplatform that started out dedicated to PM but is quickly evolving into an all-\naround HR management tool suite. While SAP SuccessFactors didn't win an\nEditors' Choice as an all-around HR solution, it's by far the best PM tool we\nreviewed and easily earns the award in this category.\n\nWhen comparing these solutions yourself, it's good to understand what kinds of\nfeatures and capabilities are available under the PM umbrella. As a rule,\nbasic PM should cover some or all of the following three tasks:\n\n**1\\. Goals, feedback, and coaching:** The tool should have some way for\nmanagers and employees to set long- and short-term goals, track those goals,\nprovide and record manager feedback, and document any coaching provided (as\nwell as how the employee responded to it). There are many mechanisms a\nsoftware architect can employ to achieve these capabilities. Therefore, it's\ncritical to have this work chain demoed to you to make sure it works within\nyour organization's culture before purchasing.\n\nFor example, a casual culture might be satisfied by a joint journaling feature\nthat lets both manager and employee keep a free-form log of ongoing coaching\nand growth. On the other hand, a more formal process (one dictated by\nstringent compliance regulations, for example) might require a more structured\nprocess involving specific documents and forms, multiple levels of approval,\nand numeric scoring.\n\n**2\\. Performance review process:** Some organizations might be happy with one\nor two evaluation forms filled out by employee and manager and then stored for\nfuture analysis. Other organizations might refer to this data much more often,\nnecessitating a dashboard-style view of an employee's performance with up-to-\nthe-minute data on job quality, skills assessment, positive and negative\nfeedback, and more. All of them should at least chime in at the start of the\nreview process, and most can automate that process either through email or\ndocument routing.\n\n**3\\. Compensation** : This is optional and depends on how directly your\ncompany links compensation to performance metrics. Some companies, especially\nSMBs, compensate employees on a more static basis, with performance scores\naffecting compensation only at extreme ends of the scale (basically, more\nreward for the very good or sanctions for the exceptionally bad). Other\ncompanies use performance scores to calculate overall compensation at varying\ngrades even for the same job, including salary, stock options, and even\nbenefit tiers. This is where HR tool suites, including both PM and payroll\ncapabilities, provide adjustable formulas and calculators designed\nspecifically to crunch those numbers. While this does generally present more\nwork, it can pay dividends not only in motivating employees to do better but\nalso in maximizing your investment in each individual.\n\n## **Tying It All Together**\n\nFor many years, most of us have grown accustomed to PM being an annual chore\nconducted primarily by an immediate supervisor and an HR professional many of\nus never even meet. Goals are designed to be achieved on at least a semi-\nannual basis and are reviewed only once every six or 12 months. While that has\nsome benefit, most of the tools we reviewed espouse a more agile PM discipline\nfor today's business managers.\n\nBy automating the performance process through email, document routing, or\ndedicated workflow capabilities, many of these tools make PM part of everyday\nemployee management simply by providing a way to track and document\nemployee/manager communications. This isn't meant to turn an employee's work\nlife into a police state. Rather, it's designed to let performance tracking\nbecome more agile and responsive.\n\nAfter all, the job goals and requirements that really matter can change on a\ndaily basis, not on a semi-annual one. By providing tools and dashboards that\nlet managers track how an employee is doing on such a cadence, HR gets a much\nclearer and granular understanding of the employee's performance, skills, and\nneeds. The trick is delivering these capabilities in such a way that they\ndon't become a burden on how managers and employees do their day-to-day jobs.\n\nThat's why HR software vendors are putting more emphasis than ever on\nusability rather than just acting as buckets for annual metrics. Many\nsolutions provide advanced reporting and analytical capabilities, including\nnew ways to build custom reports and features, letting managers and HR\nprofessionals view employee data visually. Another example is mobile access,\nwhich seems like a superfluous feature until you view it under this new HR-\nall-the-time lens. In a culture where PM is part and parcel of daily employee\nmanagement, offering mobile access to dashboards and communications\ncapabilities is critical to long-term success.\n\nA business that's seeking HR and PM solutions should consider reevaluating how\nits company can use these tools to effectively manage and assist its\nworkforce.
