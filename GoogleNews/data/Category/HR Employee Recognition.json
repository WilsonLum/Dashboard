by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic affects organizations all over the world, employees\nare increasingly becoming more anxious, frustrated and fatigued. If left\nunattended, these feelings will impact employees\u2019 productivity and engagement,\nleading to poor work quality and a disconnected workforce, and ultimately\nhampering an organization\u2019s ability to succeed in these tough times.\n\nBy and large, companies have focused contingency planning on the necessary\noperational responses to ensure business continuity. These plans often fail to\ntackle the ability of workers to concentrate on their work.\n\n[Read all of _HRE_ \u2018s coronavirus coverage\nhere.](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/\n\"https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/\")\n\nHR can help managers ensure employees get the appropriate support to tackle\nthe emotional roller coaster of this pandemic via six key strategies:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n**1\\. Feel for the wellbeing of employees.** Identifying signs of distress\namong employees, both directly through conversations and indirectly through\nobservation, is a step in the right direction for managers. Employees need an\nopportunity to raise issues and know that their employers care and are\ninvested in their welfare. To promote daily interactions between managers and\nemployees, HR should advise managers on how best to handle sensitive issues\nemerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, including [alternative work\nmodels](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/with-coronavirus-in-mind-\nare-you-ready-for-remote-work/), job security and prospects, impacts on\nstaffing and workplace conflict. ****\n\n**2\\. Encourage dialogue to build understanding.** Gartner analysis shows that\nemployees\u2019 understanding of decisions and their implications is more critical\nfor the success of a [change\ninitiative](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-ways-the-workplace-\nwill-change-in-the-next-10-years/) than employees \u201cliking\u201d the change.\nProgressive managers provide for two-way conversation with their employees to\nensure communication strategies improve engagement rather than harm.\nInteracting with managers and peers provides employees with the information\nand perspective they need, which allows them to express and process negative\nemotions and improve their feelings of control. HR can work with managers to\ncreate opportunities for two-way dialogues with their employees, which should\nfocus on a practical view of the positive and negative effects of the current\nCOVID-19 outbreak.\n\n**3\\. Use objectives to create clarity.** A strong connection between\nindividual performance and the achievement of business goals can boost\nemployees\u2019 confidence in the importance of their job, even in a challenging\nbusiness environment. Similarly, having clear objectives and receiving regular\nupdates on possible changes helps to ensure that employees maintain focus,\nenergy and a sense of purpose. Managers can reassert the connection between\nemployees\u2019 work and organizational success by providing a clear view of the\ncurrent organizational goals and translating the organization\u2019s vision into\ntheir employees\u2019 context. When employees are confident about the importance of\ntheir job to the success of the organization, they feel less anxious about\ntheir job security.\n\n**4\\. Strengthen organizational values to minimize the risk of misconduct.**\nAn unpleasant employee experience can negatively impact [psychological\nsafety](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-steps-sustainable-\ndiversity-inclusion-strategies/) by up to 35%. What\u2019s worse, during periods of\nuncertainty, employee misconduct rises by as much as 33%, according to Gartner\nresearch. Aside from modeling the right behaviors, encourage whistleblowers to\npoint out unethical practices, remind employees of the channels for reporting\nmisconduct and highlight the consequences of noncompliance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n**5\\. Tailor moments of employee appreciation.** The significant disruption\ncaused by COVID-19 will result in many [employees leaning\nout](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-do-employee-engagement-\nsurveys-tell-you-about-employee-experience/). Organizations can stem this tide\nby redoubling their recognition efforts. Effective recognition not only\nmotivates the recipient but can serve as a strong signal to other employees of\nbehaviors they should emulate. Recognition should not be limited to monetary\nrewards \u2014 public acknowledgment, tokens of appreciation, development\nopportunities and low-cost perks are also effective recognition practices. Use\nthe slowdown in business as an opportunity to provide incentives for employees\nwho usually don't have the capacity to expand.\n\n**6\\. Drive engagement via innovation.** While today\u2019s unpredictable\nenvironment will cause managers and employees to naturally become more risk-\naverse, fostering creativity and taking risks is critical for employee\nengagement and organizational performance. The disengaging impact of\nrestrictions on innovation and risk-taking are particularly severe for high-\npotential employees, who tend to have a greater appetite for these types of\nopportunities. Emphasize the need and ability of employees to [advance\ninitiatives and find process\nimprovements](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/foster-innovation-to-\ndrive-digital-transformation/) even when the organization has constraints on\nnew investments.\n\nDuring this period of uncertainty, HR should work with managers to actively\nembrace the concerns and emotions of their employees to maintain as much\nproductivity and engagement as possible.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2F6-strategies-\nto-maintain-employee-performance-and-engagement%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=6+strategies+to+maintain+employee+performance+and+engagement&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2F6-strategies-\nto-maintain-employee-performance-and-engagement%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2F6-strategies-\nto-maintain-employee-performance-and-engagement%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

It noted the\npandemic is having a significant impact on personal and work lives and can\nlead to employee anxiety, frustration and burnout, all of which can impact\nproductivity.\n\nThe six specific activities that HR should take to ensure employees get the\nneeded support to help with their emotional responses are:\n\n **Sense employees\u2019 need for support.** Managers need to recognize signs of\ndistress among their people, both directly through conversations and\nindirectly through observation. HR should provide managers with guidance.\n\n **Promote dialogue to build understanding.** To ensure communication efforts\nhelp engagement, rather than hurt it, managers must have a two-way dialogue\nwith employees. HR leaders should help managers create opportunities for two-\nway dialogues that focus on a realistic picture of both the positive and\nnegative implications of the current Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n **Use objectives to create clarity.** HR leaders can help managers reassert\nthe link between employees\u2019 work and organizational success. \u201cOne of the top\nengagement drivers for employees is seeing their work contribute to company\ngoals,\u201d said Brian Kropp, chief of research for the Gartner HR practice.\n\u201cEmployees who feel confident about the importance of their job to the success\nof the organization feel less anxious about their job security.\u201d\n\n **Reinforce organization values to reduce the likelihood of misconduct.**\nApart from modeling the right behaviors, managers should encourage\nwhistleblowers to call out unethical behaviors, remind staff of the channels\nfor reporting misconduct, and highlight what happens in case of noncompliance.\n\n **Tailor recognition to acknowledge employee efforts.** Managers must\nredouble their employee recognition efforts. The recognition does not\nnecessarily need to be monetary.\n\n **Drive engagement via innovation.** While managers and employees may\nunderstandably become more risk-averse in this uncertain environment, it is\nthese times of change and disruption that innovation and risk-taking become\neven more important for employee engagement and organizational success.\n\n# Comments\n\nAdd New Comment\n\n####  Post comment\n\nCompany\n\nName:*\n\nEmail:* (The email address will not be shown)\n\nContent:* NOTE: Links will not be clickable.\n\nNotify me of new comments\n\nRemember me\n\n## Daily News\n\nAmericas | EMEA  \nAPAC\n\n  * [US staffing revenue projected at $119.4 billion, double-digit declines this year: SIA forecast](/Editorial/Daily-News/US-staffing-revenue-projected-at-119.4-billion-double-digit-declines-this-year-SIA-forecast-53396)\n  * [Cutback in global working hours during Q2 due to Covid-19 is equivalent of 195 million full-time workers: ILO](/Editorial/Daily-News/Cutback-in-global-working-hours-during-Q2-due-to-Covid-19-is-equivalent-of-195-million-full-time-workers-ILO-53395)\n  * [Aquent says it\u2019s giving sick pay to all its workers, including contingents](/Editorial/Daily-News/Aquent-says-it-s-giving-sick-pay-to-all-its-workers-including-contingents-53394)\n  * [Some jobs may stay remote even after Covid-19: CFO survey](/Editorial/Daily-News/Some-jobs-may-stay-remote-even-after-Covid-19-CFO-survey-53393)\n  * [Company that makes Wonder Bread agrees to settle misclassification claims for $13.3 million (Reuters)](/Editorial/Daily-News/Company-that-makes-Wonder-Bread-agrees-to-settle-misclassification-claims-for-13.3-million-Reuters-53392)\n  * [Travel nurses are first to staff Covid-19 teams (CNBC)](/Editorial/Daily-News/Travel-nurses-are-first-to-staff-Covid-19-teams-CNBC-53391)\n\n  * [UK \u2013 Hydrogen Group revenue and profits sink due to weak EMEA and APAC performances](/Editorial/Daily-News/UK-Hydrogen-Group-revenue-and-profits-sink-due-to-weak-EMEA-and-APAC-performances-53390)\n  * [Netherlands \u2013 Over 800,000 people with flex contracts are at risk due to Covid-19 crisis, union says](/Editorial/Daily-News/Netherlands-Over-800-000-people-with-flex-contracts-are-at-risk-due-to-Covid-19-crisis-union-says-53389)\n  * [UK \u2013 Employment agencies now eligible for business rates discounts amid coronavirus crisis](/Editorial/Daily-News/UK-Employment-agencies-now-eligible-for-business-rates-discounts-amid-coronavirus-crisis-53388)\n  * [UK \u2013 Thousands of workers apply to pick fruit and veg amid coronavirus shutdown](/Editorial/Daily-News/UK-Thousands-of-workers-apply-to-pick-fruit-and-veg-amid-coronavirus-shutdown-53387)\n  * [Spain \u2013 Asempleo warns job growth may not return until June (EuroWeekly)](/Editorial/Daily-News/Spain-Asempleo-warns-job-growth-may-not-return-until-June-EuroWeekly-53386)\n  * [World \u2013 SThree withdraws dividend and guidance as it pauses hiring amid Covid-19 crisis](/Editorial/Daily-News/World-SThree-withdraws-dividend-and-guidance-as-it-pauses-hiring-amid-Covid-19-crisis-53375)\n\n  * [Australia \u2013 Job ads down 18.2% in March: ANZ Bank](/Editorial/Daily-News/Australia-Job-ads-down-18.2-in-March-ANZ-Bank-53385)\n  * [Japan \u2013 Recruit Group donates USD 500,000 to Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund](/Editorial/Daily-News/Japan-Recruit-Group-donates-USD-500-000-to-Covid-19-Solidarity-Response-Fund-53384)\n  * [Australia \u2013 Labour to support jobkeeper package despite ineligibility of one million casual workers (The Guardian)](/Editorial/Daily-News/Australia-Labour-to-support-jobkeeper-package-despite-ineligibility-of-one-million-casual-workers-The-Guardian-53383)\n  * [Malaysia \u2013 Government approves additional stimulus for SMEs (Straits Times)](/Editorial/Daily-News/Malaysia-Government-approves-additional-stimulus-for-SMEs-Straits-Times-53382)\n  * [Australia \u2013 Seek delays dividend as billings tumble](/Editorial/Daily-News/Australia-Seek-delays-dividend-as-billings-tumble-53370)\n  * [Singapore \u2013 Government to close most workplaces to curb spread of coronavirus](/Editorial/Daily-News/Singapore-Government-to-close-most-workplaces-to-curb-spread-of-coronavirus-53369)\n\n  * [Home](/)\u00bb\n  * [Editorial](/Editorial/)\u00bb\n  * [Daily News](/Editorial/Daily-News)\u00bb\n  * Gartner lists six HR initiatives to help maintain employee engagement during Covid-19\n\n[ ![Staffing Industry\nAnalysts](/var/ezwebin_site/storage/images/media/images/staffing-industry-\nanalysts-footer-logo/8137705-2-eng-US/Staffing-Industry-Analysts-Footer-\nLogo_medium.png) ](/var/ezwebin_site/storage/images/media/images/staffing-\nindustry-analysts-footer-logo/8137705-2-eng-US/Staffing-Industry-Analysts-\nFooter-Logo_overlay_large.png)\n\n|  Founded in 1989, Staffing Industry Analysts is the global advisor on\nstaffing and workforce solutions.

To make matters worse, during periods of uncertainty, employee\nmisconduct increases by as much as 33%.\n\nApart from modeling the right behaviors, managers should encourage\nwhistleblowers to call out unethical behaviors, remind staff of the channels\nfor reporting misconduct, and highlight punitive measures for noncompliance.\n\n**Tailor recognition to acknowledge employee efforts**  \nAs COVID-19 creates significant disruption, and undercuts employee engagement,\nmanagers need to redouble their recognition efforts. Effective recognition not\nonly motivates the recipient but can serve as a strong signal to other\nemployees of behaviors they should emulate.\n\nRecognition can take many forms other than monetary rewards -- public\nacknowledgment, tokens of appreciation, development opportunities and low-cost\nperks.\n\nFor organisations facing a slowdown in business, managers can take this\nopportunity to provide development opportunities to employees who normally do\nnot have capacity. This reinforces the organisation's commitment to the long-\nterm success of the employee.\n\n**Drive engagement via innovation**  \nWhile managers and employees may understandably become more risk-averse in\nthis uncertain environment, it is these times of change and disruption that\ninnovation and risk-taking become even more important for employee engagement\nand organisational success.\n\nThe disengaging effect of constraints on innovation and risk-taking are\nparticularly severe for high-potential (HIPO) employees who tend to have a\nstronger desire for these types of opportunities.\n\nEven when the organisation has constraints on new investments, managers can\nemphasise the need and provide opportunities for incremental innovation or\nprocess improvements.

But despite the increasing\npopularity of attractive workplace benefits, the tried and tested principles\nof empowering workers through meaningful opportunities and mentorship still\nring true. In this article, Ian Campbell discusses how the simple principles\nof giving workers autonomy and recognition will remain a critical way for\ncompanies to attract and retain talent in the digital economy. **_\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834cadce393.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nEmployee engagement has evolved considerably over the last decade. From remote\nwork privileges to flexible hours, many of the benefits that were once viewed\nas perks are now an expectation for the working world. In fact, 77 percent of\nworkers today expect companies to offer the option to work outside of the\noffice. Even free snacks, once seen as either frivolous or a \u201cnice-to-have,\u201d\nare becoming a requirement. According to the [Society for Human Resource\nManagement](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-\nsurveys/Documents/2018%20Employee%20Benefits%20Report.pdf), the percentage of\nU.S. companies offering free snacks rose from 20 percent in 2016 to 32 percent\nin 2018.\n\nThese benefits are more than just attractive \u201cnice-to-haves\u201d to tout on a\ncompany\u2019s website\u2014they are proven to have a direct return-on-investment on\nemployee engagement and business leaders across industries have embraced them\nas a way to attract and retain talent.\n\nCalculating ROI\u2014typically for technology investments\u2014is what our firm does for\nits clients. More recently, we took a look at the ROI of employee engagement\nand retention \u2014 and found the cost to replace a worker can be as high as 48\npercent of the employee\u2019s fully loaded annual cost to the employer.\n\nWorkplace benefits can help curb the costly impact that high rates of\nattrition have on a company\u2019s bottom line. They can also help companies vie\nfor talent in an increasingly competitive landscape where the rate of\nunemployment is at a historically low level.\n\nAt Nucleus Research, we\u2019ve experienced the positive impact of workplace\nbenefits first-hand. Several years ago, we implemented a series of policies to\nsupport work-life balance, including a \u201cbring your dog to work\u201d initiative,\nand we rolled out company-wide seasonal trips to reward teams for their hard\nwork throughout the year. While these gestures may seem small, cumulatively,\nthese policies have been critical for us to build out our teams and bolster\ncompany morale.\n\n## **The next frontier of employee engagement\u2014supporting the whole worker**\n\nNevertheless, material benefits can only go so far. After all, the growing\npopularity of workplace benefits isn\u2019t a passing fad\u2014it\u2019s part of a larger\ntrend of workers demanding more from their employers and expecting greater\nmeaning from their jobs. In a recent\n[poll](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/millennials-job-\nsearch-career-boomers/395663/) of young American workers, 57 percent of\nrespondents cited that their most important career priority was to find a\npersonally enjoyable, meaningful position. This goes beyond the creature\ncomforts of office snacks. Today, workers seek a greater sense of fulfillment.\n\nIn order to compete for talent in the digital economy, employers must also\nprovide their workers with opportunities that compel them to come to work\nevery day and encourage them to do their best work.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Create Better Workplaces by Mastering the Employee\nFeedback Loop](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/how-to-create-better-workplaces-by-mastering-the-employee-\nfeedback/)**\n\n## **Empowering workers**\n\nFulfillment in the workplace looks different for every employee, largely\ndepending on where that employee is in their career development. However, in\nmy experience as a founder and CEO, I\u2019ve identified two simple principles that\nare intrinsically tied to employee growth and satisfaction: control and\nrecognition.\n\nAccording to a recent Gallup poll of nearly 7,500 full-time employees, 23\npercent of respondents reported that they feel burned out at work very often\nor always and 44 percent reported feeling burned out sometimes. Workers are\nless likely to suffer stress and ultimately burnout if they have a degree of\ncontrol over their environment. Within the constraints of company objectives,\ngiving workers the autonomy to choose which projects they work on and latitude\nin the way they complete those projects increases the likelihood they will\nfeel passionate about and invested in what they are doing.\n\n**Learn More:[How Healthy Turnover Can Lead to Long-term Talent\nRetention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-\nhealthy-turnover-can-lead-to-longterm-talent-retention/)**\n\nIf employees aren\u2019t recognized for their hard work, then employee stamina and\nfocus will inevitably run dry. Recognizing an employee, especially when their\naccomplishment is exceptional or clever, is likely to generate mutual support\nfrom the rest of the team. But it must be genuine. Superficial accolades run\nthe risk of damaging a worker\u2019s drive, and employees can always tell the\ndifference.\n\nWhile these principles may not exhibit the same \u201cwow factor\u201d as free office\nperks, they can go a long way to reduce turnover and boost morale. Looking\nahead, companies that go back to basics and embrace the tried and tested\nprinciples of autonomy and recognition will witness greater levels of employee\nengagement.\n\n_Do you have best practices to follow to attract and retain talent?

While this\nmay not be feasible across all industries, the ones that are able to apply a\nwork-from-home policy are faced with challenges to ensure their employees stay\nengaged, motivated and productive during this downtime.\n\nAs employees embrace this change in the workplace, organizations must reassure\nthem that, apart from safety, their personal and professional development is a\ntop priority. By highlighting the importance of learning, reskilling and\nupskilling on the skills of tomorrow, organizations will instinctively keep\nemployees engaged and motivated in these uncertain times.\n\n### Remote Learning for everyone\n\nWhile some industries are more readily able to transition smoothly into remote\nworking, many are at the starting line of adapting to such changes. The\nexperience may also vary by generation as the younger and tech-savvy\ngeneration will embrace it with open arms. Regardless, employees are\nencouraged to make the best of the time at hand and dedicate specific learning\nhours to undertake digital learning programs. These courses are part of their\ndevelopment process and help employees acquire new perspectives and skill sets\nwhich are essential in today\u2019s dynamic business environment.\n\nThere are many people who have little or no experience of working from home.\nFor such first-time remote workers, self-paced learning programs on how to\nwork remotely, use digital collaboration tools, maintain productivity levels\nand working in virtual teams will be of immense help as they ward off feelings\nof loneliness and social distancing.\n\n### Building an effective digital learning culture\n\nDigital learning programs will come in handy especially for those who work in\nthe field and get little or no time to upgrade their skills. It\u2019s a perfect\nopportunity for them to undertake certifications and enhance their existing\nskillset which could emerge as a positive long-term benefit in their careers.\nManagers, on the other hand, need additional resources on how to manage\nvirtual teams, deal with their team\u2019s well-being while continuing to be a\nleader the team looks up to.\n\nManagers also need to consider the emotional and social factors of their team\nmembers as they hone on their supervision skills via these learning programs.\nBy providing digitally enabled experiences to their workforce across all\nsegments, from frontline executives to managers and senior leaders\norganizations can reap the benefits of digital learning and continue to build\nthe foundation for an effective digital learning culture.\n\nBy expanding learning opportunities, providing various resources for\ncontinuous professional development and keeping employees engaged during this\ndifficult period, organizations can enable a digital workforce prepared for\nthe future.\n\n**_As Alvin Toffler, the futurist rightly said, \u2018The illiterate of the future\nwill not be the person who cannot read. It will be the person who does not\nknow how to learn\u2019._**\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Employee

2020](https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/in-business/advice/spotlight-\nfalls-on-employee-engagement-to-improve-recruitment-retention/) __[Business\nMatters](https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/author/businessmatters/)\n\n![Employee Engagment](https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Depositphotos_102488478_l-2015-scaled-e1584654196253.jpg)\n\n## Almost half of HR professionals say enhanced employee engagement is the top\nstrategic HR priority within their organisation today, with one in five saying\nthat insights gleaned from employee engagement have a significant part to play\nin the future strategic direction of recruitment,\n\naccording to a recent independent study commissioned by live polling app\ntechnology company [Vevox](https://www.vevox.com/).\n\nHowever, challenges remain in this area, with 50% of HR leaders citing\nperceived lack of development opportunities as one of the top two biggest\norganisational challenges when it comes to attracting and retaining staff.\n\nIn addition, the study also found that two-fifths of the survey sample use\nstaff turnover rate as a key performance indicator of their internal\ncommunications strategy; and with a further 30% citing lack of employee\nrecognition and reward as an engagement obstacle.\n\nAnd with almost a third of polled HR professionals flagging increased employee\nretention (32%) and the ability to attract higher-quality staff as key\noutcomes of enhancing their employee engagement, it\u2019s clear that this needs to\nremain a key focus in order to attract and keep top talent.\n\nPete Eyre, Managing Director at Vevox, said: \u201cEmployee engagement is really\nbecoming instrumental in the strategic direction of businesses today. It\u2019s\ngreat to see how much it\u2019s starting to influence staff induction processes,\nwith organisations now using wider employee insights to inform their\nrecruitment and communication strategies, especially when it comes to\nmeasuring the positive impact of internal initiatives such as social events.\n\nHowever, there is still work to do. Most employees feel happier and more\nvalued when management listens to and addresses more of their ideas, so by\nputting this into practice, businesses can use employee insights to reduce\nturnover and help to bolster recruitment efforts.\u201d\n\nWith over half of HR professionals now using take-up of internal\ncommunications initiatives to measure the impact of their company\u2019s employee\nengagement strategy, it\u2019s clear that taking existing employees\u2019 ideas, needs\nand suggestions into account can vastly improve overall satisfaction levels:\nwith 38% referencing \u2018increased productivity\u2019, 34% saying \u2018recruitment becomes\neasier\u2019 and 28% citing \u2018lower employee churn\u2019 as key benefits. As such,\nrecruitment processes can benefit hugely from these insights.\n\nAs stated by Eyre: \u201cas employers start to realise that a strong employee\nengagement strategy can yield real results, we will see increasing levels of\ninvestment in internal comms and recruitment. Above all, the delivery of\nenhanced employee engagement will help businesses improve productivity, reduce\nemployee turnover, and attract talented individuals.\u201d\n\n### Sharing\n\n  * [__

Major tech companies\nsuch as Amazon, Apple and Microsoft have asked workers to work remotely.\nSchools are shifting to [working and teaching\nremotely](https://www.wbur.org/edify/2020/03/10/amherst-college-remote-\nlearning-students-leave \"https://www.wbur.org/edify/2020/03/10/amherst-\ncollege-remote-learning-students-leave\") and even [Capitol Hill\nstaffers](https://nypost.com/2020/03/07/congress-preps-plan-to-work-from-home-\namid-coronavirus-outbreak/ \"https://nypost.com/2020/03/07/congress-preps-plan-\nto-work-from-home-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/\") are preparing contingency plans\nin case of an outbreak.\n\nAs the confirmed cases and death toll rises, employees are becoming\nincreasingly paranoid. Morale is rapidly declining as many fear for their\nlives. In addition, they\u2019re overwhelmed with the change to their normal\nroutine due to children being home and warnings becoming more urgent for the\nelderly. The amount of fake news rivals the real and even the real news is\nmore than enough to cause concern. The reality is, businesses can\u2019t simply\nstop operating because of the coronavirus and remote work for many is not a\npossibility.\n\nHere are three ways employers can reduce panic and keep employee morale up\nduring the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\n **Be Intentional About Communications**\n\nIt\u2019s crucial that leaders don\u2019t get sucked into the panic. Employees look to\ntheir leaders and model their behavior especially in times of crisis.\nTherefore, it\u2019s important they remain calm and manage their emotions.\nEmployers should keep employees and contractors updated on the situation and\ninvite them to engage in the discussion. To prevent the spread of\nmisinformation through rumors and gossip, companies should only share credible\nsources like [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html\n\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index.html\") and the\n[WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019\n\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019\").\nAdditionally, they should address discriminatory behavior and remarks toward\nAsian colleagues, the origin of the disease as well as those who wear face\nmasks.\n\nLorrie Lykins, vice president of research at\n[i4cp](https://www.i4cp.com/productivity-blog/what-your-companys-response-to-\nthe-coronavirus-says-about-its-culture \"https://www.i4cp.com/productivity-\nblog/what-your-companys-response-to-the-coronavirus-says-about-its-culture\"),\nexplained \u201cproviding education about prevention, managing risk, and what is\nexpected of employees is also important.\u201d Communications should be sent to\neducate employees about their health care coverage, the [employee assistance\nprogram](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-\ntopics/benefits/pages/health-wellness-leave-benefits-help-employees-with-\ncoronavirus.aspx \"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-\ntopics/benefits/pages/health-wellness-leave-benefits-help-employees-with-\ncoronavirus.aspx\") as well as the [importance of washing their\nhands](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-\ntreatment.html \"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-\ntreatment.html\"). Henry Albrecht, CEO and founder of\n[Limeade](https://walkersands-dot-yamm-\ntrack.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1FKXh2DLcv9_rwQx_597M6koEdiUmoSOLvoW9fePsrCY-0&key=YAMMID-54085151&link=http%3A%2F%2Flimeade.com\n\"https://walkersands-dot-yamm-\ntrack.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1FKXh2DLcv9_rwQx_597M6koEdiUmoSOLvoW9fePsrCY-0&key=YAMMID-54085151&link=http%3A%2F%2Flimeade.com\"),\nprovides weekly guidance to all Limeade employees on key topics such as self-\ncare, working from home, travel policies and staying safe.\n\nNicole Junas Ravlin, president of [Junapr](https://www.junapr.com/\n\"https://www.junapr.com/\"), shared \u201cif your team is working remotely when they\ndon\u2019t typically, managers should host team meetings at least once per week so\nthat there is face-to-face contact.\u201d Leaders should encourage video calls for\nbrainstorming sessions, meetings and keeping communication open.\n\n**Relax Policies And Adjust Guidelines**\n\nDaycare and school closings threaten to upend the daily lives of working\nfamilies who have no other options for childcare. Employers should be\nempathetic, understanding and flexible as workers try to navigate the\nunexpected changes to their lives. The last thing an employee needs is their\nemployer being rigid about them working from home to take care of their family\nuntil they find an alternative solution.\n\nA Limeade [_Employee Care Report_](https://www.limeade.com/en/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/2020-Employee-Care-\nReport.pdf?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=Release&utm_campaign=Care%20Report\n\"https://www.limeade.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2020-Employee-Care-\nReport.pdf?utm_source=PR&utm_medium=Release&utm_campaign=Care%20Report\") found\n\n  * 1 in 3 employees have left a job because they didn\u2019t feel their employer cared about them as a person\n  * 25% left a job because they weren\u2019t treated with dignity by company leaders\n  * 1 in 5 left a job because their employer didn\u2019t support their well-being\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not possible for every company to offer remote work, companies\nshould consider loosening restrictions surrounding certain policies. Managers\nneed to trust when employees say they\u2019re sick and experiencing symptoms and\nwork around them as best as possible. Otherwise, employers risk infecting an\nentire place. Likewise, productivity, morale and engagement deteriorate due to\nworkers growing resentful for employers not caring about what they\u2019re going\nthrough.\n\n**Mitigate Risk And Educate**\n\nEmployers should refrain from forcing employees from traveling to countries\nwhere the [U.S. Department of\nState](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/novel-\ncoronavirus-hubei-province--china.html\n\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/ea/novel-\ncoronavirus-hubei-province--china.html\") or the CDC has recommended against.\nMark McSpadden, vice president of global product strategy and experience at\nAmerican Express Global Business Travel\n[explained](https://hrexecutive.com/coronavirus-why-employers-need-to-strike-\na-balance-on-communication/ \"https://hrexecutive.com/coronavirus-why-\nemployers-need-to-strike-a-balance-on-communication/\") \u201ccompanies have a moral\nand legal obligation to look after employees-whether it\u2019s mitigating travel\nrisk or looking after their general health and wellbeing.\u201d\n\nSuresh Sambandam, CEO of [Kissflow](https://kissflow.com/\n\"https://kissflow.com/\"), decided to bring in a doctor who is also a member of\nthe Microbial Diseases and Infection Control Team from a reputable hospital.\nThe doctor provided employees with real facts about COVID-2019 and helped them\nto differentiate between real news and myths around the disease. Sambandam\nsaid this helped remove any misconceptions around the virus and employees felt\nless paranoid as they were equipped with what they needed to do to keep\nthemselves safe.\n\nRavlin stated, if remote work isn\u2019t an option, employers can improve morale by\nmaking training fun. She shared employers \u201ccan get some [Glo\nGerm](https://www.glogerm.com/ \"https://www.glogerm.com/\") and have a hand-\nwashing contest to see who does the best job.\u201d This is also a great way to\nprovide training around sanitation practices. She also mentioned having tissue\nbox decorating contests.\n\nWhile employers can\u2019t completely do away with employee fears, they can try to\nmitigate them as best as possible. This can be done by adding more hand\nsanitizers, disinfectants and Clorox wipes, reducing or eliminating penalties\nagainst sick leaves and call off\u2019s, increasing flexibility, supplying face\nmasks and hosting awareness sessions to educate and reduce anxiety.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/twitter.com/heidilynneco) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidilynnekurter/).

In a recent field survey1 of healthcare Chief Experience\nOfficers (CXOs), about a third\n[indicated](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/whitepapers/2020-employee-care-report) they were responsible for\nOrganizational Culture, a quarter oversaw both Employee and Patient\nExperience, yet less than 12% had any sort of formal relationship with Human\nResources.\n\nCulture, Team Member Experience (TX) and Human Resources (HR) are imperative\nto a positive Patient Experience. In order to be effective, the CXO should\nhave a clearly formalized relationship with the CHRO.\n\n# Importance of Experience\n\n## Building the Foundation\n\nTeam member engagement is a foundational pillar, upon which rest several\norganizational objectives, irrespective of the industry and mission of the\norganization. It is even more relevant in industries such as healthcare, where\nan error can result in multiple deaths. The relevance gains momentum in times\nwhere healthcare is [experiencing high\nburnout](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/articles/employee-burnout-in-2020) with suicide rates double that\nof other industries, and a time where employers are competing for skills, the\nnumbers retiring exceed those entering the workforce and an industry turnover\nof about 20% 2. This significance grows exponentially when we place this\nagainst the backdrop of skyrocketing costs of healthcare in the US3, uncertain\nfederal funding programs and increasing competition from non-traditional\nplayers 4.\n\nTeam member engagement directly impacts Patient Experience (PX) and Safety\noutcomes. The top quartile of engaged healthcare teams exhibit 70% lower\nsafety incidents than those in the bottom quartile 5. A 5-point change in\nEngagement score impacts 1% profitability 6.\n\nIn my second week as the Chief Experience Officer (CXO) at Parkland, Judy\nHerrington, Vice President of Nursing made it very clear to me that the\n\"plate\" of the leader on the frontlines overflows with priorities marked\nurgent and more urgent, with new initiatives added daily, and few taken off.\nWe conduct various surveys, and each survey ends up producing another set of\n\"action items\". These action items are then pushed down from the C-Suite\nthrough the chain of command to the front-line leader. When the front-line\nleader attempts to implement, they can receive resistance from the team\nmembers as they are already busy. This results in two phenomenon: the burnout\nof the front line leader who is under pressure from above and below, and\ndisengagement of the frontline team. The engine of senior leadership driving\nfor results is pushing the train of the many hierarchical leaders down the\ntrack, where the last coach, the front-line team member, is against the blocks\nat the end of the track. Further pushing from leaders only leads to the train\nbuckling - more misalignment, turnover, cost over runs and safety issues.\n\nWhile it seems logical that Team member Experience and Patient Experience\nshould be aligned, yet, in the survey of CXOs in the US Healthcare Industry1,\nonly 24% of the CXOs indicated ownership of Team member Experience.\nInterestingly, another 28% suggested they would be more effective in their\nrole if Team member Experience was included in their scope. Furthermore, 36%\nof the CXOs indicated they were responsible for Organizational Culture while\nan additional 28% suggested they would be more effective if this was included\nin their scope.\n\nTX and PX initiatives can be, or in fact, _should_ be actioned together.\nSafety & Quality initiatives need to be clinician led to ensure buy in and\nsustainability, while being closely coordinated with TX & PX. Various\npermutations of this model are being used in various healthcare systems and\nare organization and leader dependent. While that is the case, 8% of the CXOs\nsurveyed were responsible for Safety & Quality, half of whom were actively\nattempting to divest themselves of that function.\n\nAligning TX and PX is also logical from a Financial perspective - for\nreimbursement and for customer retention and acquisition.\n\nExamining the [financial logic](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/articles/employee-experience-the-business-case) from a\nreimbursement perspective: TX impacts Communication of Nurses which is a key\ndriver for \"Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems\"\n(HCHAPs) scores. TX also impacts safety outcomes. HCAHPs, and safety outcomes\nare utilized in the Value Based Purchasing (VBP) model to calculate\nreimbursement for Medicare services provided by the organization. For the sake\nof simplicity, I am only demonstrating HCAHPs in the diagram below:\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/vishal_image_1.jpg)\n\nCustomer retention and acquisition are also impacted by TX. From a marketing\nperspective, TX impacts the experience of the Patient and their family, and\nthis impacts the customer churn. Positive team member experiences will\ndecrease the Cost of Customer Acquisition (COCA) and the Cost of Customer\nRetention (COCR) substantially, thus making the financial case again for\naligning TX and PX.\n\nVolunteer Services also play a major role by not only providing some man hours\nat no cost, but more importantly, by engaging the community. They are an\ninformal and more effective means of communicating the image, mission, vision\nand values of the organization into the community from first hand experiences.\nThis is heightened in the age of social media and impacts COCA and COCR.\nActive volunteers are crucial for effective Patient Family Advisory Councils\n(PFACs) and provide valuable insights from a Voice of the Consumer (VOC)\nperspective. They are also excellent ambassadors to patients and their\nfamilies, in allaying any fears as a true third party that may have\nexperienced or seen a positive outcome of a similar procedure at the\norganization. While 28% of the CXOs surveyed managed volunteer services,\nanother 20% were working on bringing them into the experience fold to maximize\nsuch opportunities.\n\nThe dynamics of the factors impacting Team member & Patient Experience that\nare influenced by HR and Culture of the Organization are examined in the\ncontext of the data from Parkland (inclusive of both Parkland staff and UT\nSouthwestern providers primarily assigned to Parkland). The top factors were:\n\n  * Teamwork, Recognition, Leadership cares about \"me\", and factors impacting burnout (time to do my job (staffing), meaningful feedback, compensation, recognition, influence over decisions) \n\nThe interplay of these variables, when layered on top of the financial model\ndiscussed earlier, can be represented in the diagram as below:\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/vishal_image_2.jpg)\n\n\n\nThe system dynamics model above depicts that the primary drivers for HCAHPS\nare Team member Engagement, Communication with Nursing and Trust in Provider.\nIf we examine Patient's Trust in Provider (PTP), it is dependent upon Time\nspent with provider (staffing) and provider Burnout, both of which lead us\nback to other variables leading to HR and Culture. Other variables are mapped\nin a similar manner. Note the number of variables that are in the purview of\nthe HR team.\n\nWhile other support initiatives are required, such as those in the realm of\nProcess Improvement and Technology, to affect a meaningful change in TX & PX\nmetrics; HR is the key.\n\n> REPORT:  [The Interesction of Employee Engagement and Business\n> Success](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/reports/the-\n> intersection-of-employee-engagement-and-business-success)\n\nWhen we set up the CXO role at Parkland, our CEO, Dr. Fred Cerise and our then\nChief Talent Officer,\n\nDr. Jim Dunn saw in their wisdom the logic of placing both Team member and\nPatient Experience under the CXO. It is important to note that while we have\nhad leadership changes at Parkland, this structure has not changed and is now\nbeing reinforced even further by our current CTO, Felicia Miller. Leveraging\nthis strategy continuously over the past three years has helped achieve the\nfollowing metrics:\n\n  * HCAHPS scores for the Quarter ending December 2019 saw us in the 90th percentile for the National Database and in the 93rd percentile for University Health Systems Consortium. (Moving from the 79th and 75th percentiles respectively since Sep 2017).\n  * We achieved our Annual HCAHPS 2019 target of 89.3, a statistically significant improvement.\n  * Mean Employee Engagement score rose by 17 percentile ranks; nearly 6% over three years.\n  * Number of Tier 1 leaders rose from 32 to 122 over three years.\n  * Turnover decreased from 18.5% to 15.1% in 2018, representing savings of $9 million and is annualized at 14.8 % for 2019.\n  * Employee engagement survey participation grew from a flat 59% in 2014 and 2016 to 79% in 2017 and 88% in 2018. \n\nThe theory of combining TX and PX, its practical application at Parkland and\nresultant outcomes - all point to the benefits of having TX & PX under one\nleader, the Chief Experience Officer.\n\n\n\n**References**\n\n  1. \"CXO Structure Survey\", Vishal Bhalla, February 2020.

Ensuring the right technology is in place is key to the success of\nthis \"new normal.\"_\n\n_Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, non-essential personnel have been asked to work\nfrom home, creating a new remote workforce that most companies weren't\nprepared for. And employees who are suddenly working from home -- often in\nchallenging circumstances and without the right technology -- are likely to\nface social isolation and experience a drop in productivity._\n\n![Brian\nKropp](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/kropp_brian.jpg)Brian Kropp\n\n_In this Q &A, Brian Kropp, __chief of research for Gartner HR, discusses how\nto ensure the success of this newly remote workforce by turning to new\nprocesses and using workplace communication tools._\n\n**What are some of HR's most pressing challenges in dealing with the COVID-19\npandemic?**\n\nBrian Kropp: We've worked through a couple of different phases during this\ntime period. The first phase was protecting people's health and safety; get\npeople out of the office and get them home. The second big thing is making\nsure people know how to work in a remote environment.\n\nA lot of companies are really focusing on new communication strategies and\ntrying to be really innovative about helping employees understand what's going\non. And what we're finding is that they just can't send out more emails or put\nmore stuff on company sites. People are overwhelmed by all that and not even\nlooking at it anymore.\n\nSo [HR needs to] come up with interesting ways to [communicate to\nemployees](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/5-tips-for-HR-\nEmployee-communications-during-coronavirus-outbreak).\n\n**How should HR and IT work together to facilitate remote work productivity?\n**\n\nKropp: There are a lot of interactions between HR and IT, especially early on,\nto understand the technology that employees have. The initial set of questions\nare really around assessment of basic capabilities.\n\nSo much has moved so fast, and [companies] feel like they have to buy all new\nsoftware applications and technologies to actually be productive. HR and IT\nhave to work incredibly closely at this point to make sure that the technology\ninvestment decisions, in terms of [enabling remote\nwork](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/4-ways-to-implement-HR-\nsupport-for-remote-employees) and monitoring employees, is actually able to be\nused in the industry in the right way.\n\nThere's a lot of companies that are trying to sell products to IT executives\n[that] can track and monitor employees that are working remote.\n\nBut if IT and HR aren't working through how to [implement that\ntechnology](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252479594/As-remote-\nwork-tools-deploy-next-task-is-behavioral), [and they] don't manage\ncommunication in the workforce correctly about that technology, you run the\nrisk of spending a lot of money on it, alienating your workforce and not\ngetting any benefits.\n\n**How should HR be working with managers to help newly-remote employees beat\nisolation and stay productive?**\n\nKropp: One of the important things that companies can do [to really engage\nemployees](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/HR-response-to-\nCOVID-19-can-kill-or-boost-employee-experience) at this point in time is to\nfocus on recognition. There's a lot of employees who feel like they're working\nreally hard, but the manager doesn't realize it anymore. During periods of\nstress and disruption, the action of recognizing employees matters a lot. That\nis one of the most important things that you can do to help them become re-\nengaged and be as productive as possible.\n\n**How can workplace communication tools boost productivity and engagement?**\n\nKropp: [Many] employees who work from home report feeling more socially\nisolated and feel like they've got fewer social connections. By [promoting the\nuse of] certain communication tools -- and not just for work, but for\nfriendship -- is a really important way to help drive employee engagement.\nEmployees just started naturally using [workplace communication tools] for\nsocial things since [newly-remote employees] aren't getting the chance to get\na cup of coffee with someone or go grab lunch.\n\nSo [HR and IT] can really trying to think about interesting ways from a\ncommunication perspective to try and build a social connection.\n\nThese workplace communication tools help employees actually do the work. It\ncan create a social connection and give employers a better sense of what's\nactually going on with those employees and how they're feeling.\n\n**What specific workplace communication tools can help coworkers and teams\nconnect when they are feeling isolated?**\n\nKropp: Companies have been using communication tools like Slack and Teams and\nthose have largely become the communication channels of choice for most\norganizations.\n\n**Are these tools enough to keep employees productive?**\n\nKnopp: The problem is a lot of these online tools are really designed for\ncommunication, not work. So what [HR] needs to be thinking about, because it\ncertainly appears that we're going to be in this situation [potentially for\nmonths](https://www.ocregister.com/2020/03/19/could-coronavirus-work-at-home-\narrangements-become-permanent/), is [finding tools to] enable better peer-to-\npeer interactions and better team-based work, because those types of tools are\ngoing to be the most important to get people to work together.\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on Employee engagement and recognition software\n\n  * [\n\n##### Farmers Insurance piloting human-like VR training\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252480754/Farmers-Insurance-\npiloting-human-like-VR-training)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Virtual hiring, avoiding layoffs part of HR's pandemic response\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252480594/Virtual-hiring-\navoiding-layoffs-part-of-HRs-pandemic-response)\n\n  * [\n\n##### A remote work policy needs infrastructure, collaboration support\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/finnell_katherine.jpg) By:\nKatherine Finnell\n](https://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/feature/A-remote-work-\npolicy-needs-infrastructure-collaboration-support)\n\n  * [\n\n##### 5 tips for HR: Employee communications during coronavirus outbreak\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/baker_pam.jpg) By: Pam Baker\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/5-tips-for-HR-Employee-\ncommunications-during-coronavirus-outbreak)\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [How IT and HR can Partner to Deliver a Better Employee Experience](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/How-IT-and-HR-can-Partner-to-Deliver-a-Better-Employee-Experience) -Citrix\n  * [The Economic and Employee Benefits of a Flexible Working Environment](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/The-Economic-and-Employee-Benefits-of-a-Flexible-Working-Environment) -Citrix\n  * [Deploying a Digital Workspace?

collaborate.\n  * **Recognition Tools** \\- Tools for employees to provide peer to peer recognition and badges to reinforce/drive organizational culture across virtual teams.\n  * **Goals/OKR -**

productive.\n  * **Learning (LMS)** \\- Continue to develop your people with easy to use online training tools.\n  * **Survey(s)** \\- Get feedback on how people are doing and what they need to be successful in a virtual environment.\n  * **Employee Feedback** \\- Tools for employees to provide real-time feedback to drive development, call out good work, and address critical issues.\n\nFor

employees for their good work is essential to good business.\n\nIn fact, when researchers in one survey asked employees, \u201cWhat can your\nmanager do to make this a better place to work?\u201d almost 90% of them said,\n\u201cRecognize me for a job well done.\"\n\nSo, what\u2019s the best way to go about it? Here are some great ways to recognize\nyour people:\n\n## Employee recognition that works\n\nThis is important enough to mention time and again. Employees can never be\nover-recognized for good and outstanding work and extra-mile efforts. Leaders\nwho take time every day (yes, every day) create a highly motivated, productive\nenvironment.\n\nSome ways to do it daily:\n\n    * Put it on the calendar. Note names of people who you want to commend for something\n    * Mark it with a penny. One leader puts five pennies in his right pocket each morning. As he hands out compliments or praise, he moves a penny into his left pocket until they\u2019re all gone. Some days, he needs more pennies!\n    * Start it off right. A company president makes sure the first three things he says in the office each day are positive and/or complimentary. It sets the tone for the day.\n\n## Honor employees\n\nEmployees need to feel their work means something to their bosses and the\ncompany. They need to be recognized as a person first and as an employee\nsecond. So recognize them for the good things they do outside work, too.\n\nAsk if you can announce and recognize their anniversaries, birthdays, special\naccomplishments and important events at work. Then talk about them at meetings\nor include a write-up about them in you in-house publication or in an email.\n\n## Create a plan\n\nHelp every employee develop a \u201cvision\u201d for personal success in the\norganization. Create a template they can use to document skills they\u2019ve\nlearned and ones they\u2019d like to master. Use that to pick goals and to create a\npath they can follow to reach those goals.\n\n## Pay attention to them\n\nStudies find the best leaders have several things in common, one being they\n[carve out time to chat with their\nemployees](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/one-on-one-meetings/) one-on-\none. They use that time \u2013 and it can be just a few minutes every week \u2013 to\ngive undivided attention to details on each employee\u2019s work and personal\nlives.\n\nThis gives leaders a chance to see how employees manage all of their demands,\noffer help when possible and uncover new ways to boost morale based on what\nemployees care about most.\n\n## Include their families\n\nTalk to employees about their families (spouse\u2019s job or philanthropic works,\npet\u2019s health, daughter\u2019s talents, son\u2019s basketball game, etc.). If possible,\ncreate a newsletter to share family-oriented information, that employees can\nsubmit information they want to share about their loved ones.\n\nAlso, when an employee is recognized for a significant achievement, send a\nletter home to the employee's family explaining what happened, and how the\norganization valued the employee's efforts\n\n## Special events\n\nRegular, off-task events that are short and fun give employees something to\nanticipate and something fun to do. Psychologists say[ having something to\nlook forward](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/engaging-employees-\nfulfillment/) to reduces stress by creating a healthy anticipation of the\nfuture.\n\nSome ideas: Plan occasional dress down days (you might even ask employees to\npay for the privilege and give the money to a charity). Schedule weekly\nlunchtime group walks. Have a chili cook-off.\n\n## Add humor\n\nLaughter is great for the workplace. Leaders can incorporate appropriate fun\nstories into their speeches. One of the best ways for leaders to get their\npeople laughing is to poke fun at themselves. Remember humorous mistakes you\nmade in your young, working career and share them.\n\n## Say hello every day\n\nA manager at an insurance company positions himself at the entrance of his\ndepartment nearly every day so he can greet employees. With a smile on his\nface, he asks questions about their evenings or weekends. His interest in\ntheir lives sets the stage for a positive day.\n\n## Get meeting input\n\nThe more managers include employees in meeting planning, the more likely\nemployees will want to be a contributing part of them. One supervisor asks\nemployees to submit topics for regular meetings. In addition to covering what\nthey want to discuss, he leaves time for \u201cA-ha\u201d moments. It\u2019s a time when\nemployees either share something they learned that may benefit others or\nsomething they witnessed a co-worker do that deserves recognition.\n\n## Change the focus\n\nLeaders measure results. But if they spend a little more time focused on\nemployees, and less on the numbers, results will follow. So regularly ask\nemployees how they think processes can be improved. It\u2019ll provide a two-fold\nbenefit. Employees will be happy their input is valued (and used), and the\ncompany will have better processes\n\n## Share in the work\n\nManagers who are too busy to help employees or who believe they\u2019re above the\nwork they\u2019re asking employees to do, will demoralize staff. When employees\nface tough or busy times, managers want to step into the trenches, show they\ncare about their people and find ways to make their lives easier.\n\n## Talk from the top-down\n\nThe biggest reason morale plummets at organizations  and employees feel left\nout and unrecognized is a lack of communication. Employees want to know where\nthe company is headed and what\u2019s going on in other departments. That means\nmanages should regularly report to staff the information they learn in\nmanagement meetings.\n\nIn fact, companies that give employees a voice in management meetings report\nhigher levels of morale than companies that don\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean you have\nto allow employees to make decisions are you C-level meetings. But consider\noffering them an avenue to make suggestions, air concerns and share new ideas\nup the chain of command. One CEO said she holds regular town hall meetings and\nspends at least an hour on the floor with employees at each of her companies\u2019\nfacilities every month.\n\nShe also has what she calls her\u201cCharlene Chatline,\u201d a monthly publication to\ntell employees about worldwide operations, innovations and industry news. Plus\nshe takes \u201cComments to Charlene\u201d \u2013 email messages from employees with\nquestions and concerns, which she personally answers.\n\n## Create social committees\n\nEmployees who have outlets to do what they personally enjoy around work will\nhave higher morale. That\u2019s why the management at a financial services company\nin Canada allowed and encouraged employees to create \u201csocial committees.\u201d Sign\nup sheets were posted in the break rooms and groups formed to meet on their\nbreaks or even after hours. Some of their most popular committees: health and\nwellness, breakfast, social and birthday.\n\n    * The wellness group sends email health tips each week and plans post-work soccer games, runs and bike rides.\n    * The breakfast club purchases coffee, pastries and bagels with donations for employees who don\u2019t have time to get a meal at home.\n    * The social committee gets people involved in paintball events, family picnics and local theater.\n    * The birthday committee decorates cubicles and plans periodic group celebrations.\n\n![Rich\nHenson](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Rich\nHenson](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Rich\nHenson](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/rhensonnewfinal-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Rich Henson](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/rhenson/)\n\nRich Henson, a member of the HRMorning staff, has spent the past two decades\ndeveloping potent HR and Management content that helps guide successful\nleaders forward with confidence.

Organizations need to focus on employees '\nemotions related to the pandemic to restore productivity and deliver on\nemployee experience, according to Gartner._\n\nThe significant impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on employees' personal and\nwork lives is leading to employee anxiety, frustration and burnout. When left\nunattended, these feelings can affect employees' productivity and engagement,\nleading to poor work quality, errors and eventually influencing an\norganization's ability to survive in these difficult times.\n\n\"Most organizations have focused on scenario planning and necessary\noperational responses to ensure business continuity,\" said Brian Kropp, chief\nof research for the Gartner HR practice. \"However, these plans often do not\naddress, nor impact, employees' ability to focus on their work.\"\n\nHR should help managers at all levels do six specific activities to ensure\nemployees get the requisite support to tackle the emotional response:\n\n**Sense employees ' need for support**  \nManagers need to recognize signs of distress among their people, both directly\nthrough conversations and indirectly through observation. To facilitate\nregular conversations between managers and employees, HR should provide\nmanagers with guidance on how best to broach sensitive subjects arising from\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including alternative work models, job security and\nprospects, impact to staffing, and tension in the workplace. This guidance can\ninclude discussion guides, training or email reminders with the latest updates\non the situation and general principles for how to deal with it.\n\n**Promote dialogue to build understanding**  \nTo ensure communication efforts help, rather than hurt, engagement, managers\nmust have a two-way dialogue with employees. Two-way communication with\nmanagers and peers provides employees with the information and perspective\nthey need, while allowing them to express and process negative emotions and\nimprove their feelings of control. HR leaders should help managers create\nopportunities for two-way dialogues that focus on a realistic picture of both\nthe positive and negative implications of the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Use objectives to create clarity**  \nA direct link between individual performance and the achievement of business\ngoals can boost employees' confidence in the importance of their job even in a\nchallenging business environment. Clear objectives and regular updates on\npossible changes will help ensure employees maintain focus, energy and a sense\nof purpose. HR leaders can help managers reassert the link between employees'\nwork and organizational success by providing visibility into the current\norganizational goals and translating the organization's vision into their\nemployees' context.\n\n\"One of the top engagement drivers for employees is seeing their work\ncontribute to company goals,\" said Mr. Kropp. \"Employees who feel confident\nabout the importance of their job to the success of the organization feel less\nanxious about their job security.\"\n\n**Reinforce organizational values to reduce the likelihood of misconduct**  \nWork well-being has the greatest impact on feelings of psychological safety \u2014\nan unpleasant employee experience can negatively impact psychological safety\nby up to 35 percent. To make matters worse, during periods of uncertainty,\nemployee misconduct increases by as much as 33 percent. Apart from modeling\nthe right behaviors, managers should encourage whistleblowers to call out\nunethical behaviors, remind staff of the channels for reporting misconduct,\nand highlight punitive measures for noncompliance.\n\n**Tailor recognition to acknowledge employee efforts**  \nAs COVID-19 creates significant disruption, and undercuts employee engagement,\nmanagers need to redouble their recognition efforts. Effective recognition not\nonly motivates the recipient but can serve as a strong signal to other\nemployees of behaviors they should emulate. Recognition can take many forms\nother than monetary rewards \u2014 public acknowledgment, tokens of appreciation,\ndevelopment opportunities and low-cost perks. For organizations facing a\nslowdown in business, managers can take this opportunity to provide\ndevelopment opportunities to employees who normally do not have capacity. This\nreinforces the organization's commitment to the long-term success of the\nemployee.\n\n**Drive engagement via innovation**  \nWhile managers and employees may understandably become more risk-averse in\nthis uncertain environment, it is these times of change and disruption that\ninnovation and risk-taking become even more important for employee engagement\nand organizational success. The disengaging effect of constraints on\ninnovation and risk-taking are particularly severe for high-potential (HIPO)\nemployees who tend to have a stronger desire for these types of opportunities.\nEven when the organization has constraints on new investments, managers can\nemphasize the need and provide opportunities for incremental innovation or\nprocess improvements. This can be particularly meaningful if it addresses a\nchallenge the team or organization is facing related to process disruptions or\nbusiness impact.\n\n* * *\n\nLearn more about how to lead organizations through the disruption of\ncoronavirus in the [Gartner coronavirus resource\ncenter](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gartner.com%2Fen%2Finsights%2Fcoronavirus%3Futm_medium%3Dpress-\nrelease%26utm_campaign%3DRM_GB_2020_GTR_NPP_PR1_CORONAVIRUS&esheet=52193812&newsitemid=20200325005089&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=Gartner+coronavirus+resource+center&index=8&md5=079e7c39de794e190e726d983e5ff27d),\na collection of complimentary Gartner research and webinars to help\norganizations respond, manage and prepare for the rapid spread and global\nimpact of COVID-19.\n\n  \n![](/images/businesscontinuityinformation3.png)\n\n### Want news and features emailed to you?\n\n[Signup to our free newsletters](/index.php/newsletters) and never miss a\nstory.\n\n[ ![Conductrr -\n270x650](https://www.continuitycentral.com/images/banners/conductrrCC-270x650r.gif)\n](/index.php/component/banners/click/241 \"Conductrr - 270x650\")\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n  * [Pandemic Planning](/index.php/pandemic-planning)\n  * [2020 predictions](/index.php/2020-predictions)\n  * [Business continuity standards](/index.php/business-continuity-standards)\n  * [Business continuity software](/index.php/business-continuity-software)\n  * [Events diary](/index.php/events-diary)\n  * [Newsfeed](http://www.continuitycentral.com/newsfeed.xml)\n  * [How to advertise](/index.php/how-to-advertise-on-continuity-central)\n  * [Archive](http://www.continuitycentral.com/archive.htm)\n\n### A website you can trust\n\nThe entire Continuity Central website is scanned daily by Sucuri to ensure\nthat no malware exists within the site.

people may work for a salary or economic\nrealities but ultimately, people should feel great about their association\nwith an organization.\n\nAs the world of work undergoes disruption, embraces digital and faces a fierce\nwar for talent and skills, creating an employee experience (EX) that\ndifferentiates employers and actually retains talent is going to be critical\nin all aspects.\n\nIn an exclusive interaction with People Matters, Vikas Bansal, CHRO, Edelweiss\nTokio Life Insurance shares his views on what organizations can do to create a\nsuperlative employee experience.\n\n### What are some of the critical things organizations can do to build a\ndifferentiated employee experience?\n\nEmployee experience plays an important role especially in the life insurance\nsector, which is heavily reliant on advisory and customer service. Often,\ncompanies do not realize that focusing only on customer experience cannot\ngenerate the desired business impact unless they are creating the right\nemployee experience. Both are intrinsically linked.\n\nThere is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach for EX. Every company has a unique\nmake-up and must invest in recognizing relevant factors that will create a\nvalue-based culture, which will make way for the right employee experience.\nHowever, one crucial factor for the success of creating a positive EX is\nconsistency and sustainability.\n\nHere are some key tenets that can guide a company in mapping out their EX\njourney: **Association, Purpose, Recognition, Drive, and Well-being**. The\nfirst three tenets help create pride in one\u2019s work and therefore fulfill the\nlast two. To put it simply, you need to institutionalize all the right\ntechnologies and platforms to empower your workforce.\n\nFor instance, as a life insurance company, we need to create a platform that\ndevelops the knowledge of our advisors and equips them in dealing with\ncustomers. This, in turn, creates affinity for the work they are involved in\nand gives them a purpose or the fulfillment of carrying out meaningful work.\nSetting up recognition programs at regular intervals also provides them with\nthe drive and passion for their work and keeps them invested in not only\nfulfilling their professional goals but also personal ones.\n\n### How do you build a business case for EX such that it translates in every\ndecision in the talent strategy to maximize business success. How can you\ndesign your EX vision to align it with your business metrics?\n\n> \u201cVery simply, happy employees lead to a happy and healthy business.\n> Companies cannot lose sight of the fact that they are functional because OF\n> the people working for them and FOR the people availing their services.\u201d\n\nI wholeheartedly believe that an employee\u2019s productivity directly relates to\nwhether he believes that his role is meaningful. A higher sense of purpose is\nessential for productivity and EX can help achieve that. The older belief that\nfinancial remuneration is enough to keep an employee satisfied and productive\nis outdated. People want to work with organizations that provide value,\nprofessionally and personally.\n\nTo create synergy with business metrics, it is also critical for HR to partner\nwith the business so that there is company-wide ownership of creating a\nmeaningful and positive EX. When it is co-created with business, EX becomes a\npart of an organization\u2019s growth story and a powerful tool for brand creation.\n\nIn fact, an MIT study predicts that EX can help an organization deliver 25%\ngreater profitability, 2x customer satisfaction, and 2x innovation.\n\n### What are some of the things leaders can do to set such an example? There\nare many factors that can make or break Employee Experience, and one of the\nmost critical ones is \u2013 the leadership. A leader\u2019s role starts from first\nunderstanding what constitutes a great employee experience, the steps to make\nit happen, leading by example, and making EX a business priority for everyone.\n\nLeadership, perhaps, plays the most important role in achieving the\naforementioned tenets of EX. The success of EX is highly dependent on the\nbelief of leaders in its impact on business and CX.\n\nLeaders play a crucial role in keeping the entire organization tethered to the\nvalues and business goals; they help create drive among employees and ensure\nthem that their work is meaningful. In simpler words, they are the foremost\nagents in telling employees what they should feel about the organization.\nCreating a culture of open communication and transparency is also incumbent\nupon leaders as it creates a positive EX and belief in the organization.\n\n> \u201cLeaders must adopt a top to bottom approach, where they support and serve\n> their teams as much as their employees are serving them. This goes a long\n> way in creating affinity and a sense of belongingness which is a powerful\n> driver for employees.\u201d\n\n### How do you institute recognition programs that enable physical, mental,\nsocial and/or emotional wellness with high employee coverage, deliver a great\nemployee experience and build a culture that performs?\n\nA single recognition program cannot achieve the desired EX. There must be a\ngreater emphasis on adopting a culture of appreciation. A culture, by\ndefinition, is a habit that you are less likely to digress from.\n\nRecognition can be in many forms \u2013 be it through customized development\nprograms, simply recognizing the stellar work employees have showcased or\nbecoming guardians of their wellness. At Edelweiss Tokio Life, we have tried\nto work on these parameters to ensure a higher involvement from employees.\n\nFor instance, we have at least four types of development programs which are\naimed at creating leaders, nurturing the individual contributors and enabling\nmanagers to effectively manage their teams. Similarly, we are trying to\ninstill an entrepreneurial culture among our salesforce to recognize their\npotential and helping them fulfill their own dreams and aspirations. We have\npartnered with well-known educational institutions like NMIMS and IIM Indore\nthat are creating a customized development module to address the leadership\nand entrepreneurial training needs of our employees.\n\n### What are some of the things in your organization\u2019s culture that contribute\nto building a superior employee experience which in turn translates into\nbetter customer experience?\n\nWhile there are several initiatives we undertake to create a positive EX,\nthere are some that stand out:\n\na) **Vijaypath** : The insurance industry is highly reliant on providing the\nright advisory to customers. Since inception, our salesforce has followed this\nneed-analysis tools which provides customers with a complete overview of their\nneeds and then recommends solutions to those address those needs. This has\ncontributed to instilling the value of customer centricity among our\nemployees. It has become a central point of employee experience, as it\nreflects our business ethics and emphasis on customer-centricity.\n\nb) **Pro-entrepreneurial:** We are extremely proud of our Managing Partner\nprogram. This recognition platform is applicable for our sales managers and is\nan industry-first property. Based on certain pre-decided criteria, our sales\nmanagers can ascend to the level of Managing Partner, wherein Edelweiss Tokio\nLife provides them with the infrastructure and capital support to set up their\nown office. While they continue to be an employee of Edelweiss Tokio Life,\nthey are treated as a separate business unit. This has helped us create a\nsense of ownership and drive among our employees.\n\nAs an extension of this program, we have identified nearly 100 sales managers\nacross the country who hold the potential of becoming Managing Partners. They\nwill undergo a development program called Apex which equips them to handle\ntheir own offices among other things.\n\nc) **Emphasis on training** : In the life insurance industry, knowledge and\nhaving the know-how to advise customers is a pre-cursor to having pride in\nwork. We have been focusing on creating robust training processes that can\nhelp our employees fulfill those factors. In fact, we recently were accredited\nwith ISO 21001:2018 Certification for Designing and Delivery of Learning\nPrograms, which also is an industry-first development.\n\nd) **Tech-enabled systems:** We recently launched an interactive chatbot on\nWhatsApp called Risa for our employees. The idea is to bring in agility and\nflexibility to work and these measures are helping us realize these\naspirations.\n\ne) **ICONS:** We have instituted a recognition program for all our employees\ncalled \u2018ICONS\u2019 which not only recognizes their leadership, innovation,\ncustomer-centricity, but also their social responsibility. It is crucial for\nus as an organization that our employees be responsible citizens and provide\ncommunity support wherever necessary. We have found an uproarious response\nalways to all social initiatives be it Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Contributing to\nArmed Forces or supporting a cause like Organ Donation. These kinds of\nrecognition platforms have helped us instill a sense of social responsibility.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Employee Engagement](/category/compensation-\nperformance/employee-engagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=employee-\nengagement \"Browse more in: Employee Engagement\"),\n[#CXtoEX](/tag/cxtoex?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=cxtoex \"Browse more\nin: CXtoEX\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Shweta Modgil](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1524982217/authors/shweta-\nmodgil.jpg)](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\n#### [Shweta Modgil](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\nShweta is working as a Senior Features Writer with People Matters.

We bring the Power of Identity to customers\naround the world.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nPhoto:\n\nGetty\n\nCompanies across all industries rely on key performance indicators (KPIs) and\ngoal-setting to track progress against specific business objectives. Whether\nit\u2019s hitting a specific sales target, closing a certain customer, reaching a\nnew revenue milestone or improving email marketing conversion rates, KPIs and\npredetermined goals serve as essential tools for regularly and objectively\nchecking in on how a business is advancing.\n\nEqually important to business-focused KPIs are culture-focused goals; however,\nit\u2019s rare that tech companies take the time to step back and evaluate how\ntheir team and overall ethos are progressing. This is surprising, as the\nimportance of company culture has been discussed ad nauseum in recent years.\nPositive work cultures have been definitively linked to [higher rates of\nemployee engagement](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238052/culture-wins-\ngetting-people.aspx), which leads to greater business [productivity and\nprofitability](https://hbr.org/2015/12/proof-that-positive-work-cultures-are-\nmore-productive). What\u2019s more, given millennials\u2019 and Gen Zers\u2019\n[proclivity](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/05/how-millennials-and-gen-z-are-\nreshaping-the-future-of-the-workforce.html) for environments that support\nself-development, flexible work options and future-proofing strategy,\ncompanies need to continually prioritize modernizing their culture \u2014 that is,\nif they want to compete in hiring and retaining the dominant generations in\ntoday\u2019s workforce.\n\n**Best Practices For Objectively Progressing Culture**\n\nAdmittedly, tracking company culture-related progress isn\u2019t nearly as\nstraightforward as tracking specific sales or marketing KPIs. Rather than\nwriting off culture as untrackable, though, reframe this traditionally\nnebulous concept into something more finite and measurable. First, clearly\n[define your core\nvalues](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/11/06/how-\ncorporate-culture-can-make-or-break-your-organization/#23b105a56d27), which\nserve as the foundation for how any startup operates. Then, consider the\nfollowing tips:\n\n**1\\. Qualify fun or unconventional perks.** Though they\u2019re a common part of\nthe tech world, fun perks certainly don\u2019t make a company culture. But they\u2019re\nstill important, because often these are the perks that attract the people you\nwant to hire. At our company, we have craft beer and pingpong tables, in\naddition to our somewhat infamous bowls of candy in the lobbies. There\u2019s also\nan annual family picnic and regular charitable projects. These perks are what\nour employees look forward to, and better yet, they don\u2019t consume employees\u2019\ntime or encourage them to spend more time at work than is necessary. When\nconsidering any fun, less conventional perks that your company can provide, be\nsure to qualify them. Keep asking yourself: How is this perk activating our\nemployees and enabling them to be better? Let these qualifiers guide you as\nyou consider various team-building, career growth and charitable initiatives,\nfor instance.\n\n**2\\. Establish explicit methods for employee recognition.** Recognition is a\nlow-cost, high-impact way to keep employee morale up and bolster positive\ncompany culture. In fact, 71% of highly engaged companies recognize employees\nfor a job well done, according to a 2019 survey by Bonusly and HR.com. While\nit can be helpful to dole out various forms of flattery or appreciation on an\nad-hoc basis, it\u2019s also important to be deliberate. Set up an employee review\nand/or awards program that takes place each quarter, for example, and offer\nexplicit development opportunities and growth-driven challenges that motivate\nemployees to \u201cstep up.\u201d When employees have a clear career path within a\ncompany and feel sufficiently recognized and rewarded for their efforts,\nthey\u2019ll be that much more driven to improve and broaden their skills.\n\n**3\\. Regularly submit for workplace award programs.** Even when company\nvalues are clearly established, unconventional perks are repeatedly qualified\nand employee recognition is given in a deliberate fashion, measuring culture-\nrelated progress can still be challenging. An additional tactic that can\nprovide concrete feedback on an annual basis involves submitting for workplace\naward programs, such as Glassdoor\u2019s Best Places to Work, _Inc._ \u2019s Best\nWorkplaces or your local [Top Workplaces](https://topworkplaces.com/). This\ncan be particularly valuable for tech companies operating in a highly\ncompetitive space. Use these submissions, and track your fellow competitors to\nestablish a baseline for how your culture is fairing. Also, take the time to\nreview your award submission results year to year to pinpoint any clear\nlearnings or areas in need of improvement.\n\n**Successful Tech Company Cultures Require Intention And Goal-Setting**\n\nEmployees are often referred to as \u201chuman capital,\u201d and for good reason. As\ninvaluable assets in today\u2019s business world, your employees deserve a strong\ncompany culture that\u2019s continuously improving and supporting them in\nmeaningful ways. Apply the same intentional, concerted efforts used in other\nareas of your business to foster an engaging and productive work environment.\nWhen you take the time to clearly define and measure aspects of your culture\nas your company evolves, your employees will be better equipped to achieve\nlong-term success, both personally and on behalf of your business.\n\n[Forbes Technology\nCouncil](http://www.forbestechcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology\nexecutives. **_[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbestechcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)_**\n\n[![Mark McClain](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil/files/2017/10/markmcclain1_avatar_1508257522-400x400.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/markmcclain1/\n\"Photo of Mark McClain\")\n\n[Mark\nMcClain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/markmcclain1/)\n\nCEO & Founder of [SailPoint](https://www.sailpoint.com/), the leader in\nenterprise identity management.

Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\nWith Employee Appreciation Day (EAD) coming up this Friday (6 March 2020), it\nmight be good to know that 44% of workers view it as \u201cextremely or very\nimportant\u201d to recognise EAD.\n\nHowever, according to a survey by O.C. Tanner, only 8% knew when it was\nobserved and only 10% said their current employer does anything to actually\ncelebrate the day.\n\nThe survey further revealed that companies that celebrate EAD can see positive\ncorrelations in relation to employees and other workplace attitudes:\n\n  * 84% of those who work at companies that celebrate EAD have a strong desire to be working for their current employer one year from now, as opposed to only 54% at companies that don\u2019t celebrate EAD.\n  * 83% of those who work at companies that celebrate EAD note that they often give recognition to their fellow employees when they do great work, as opposed to 73% at companies that don\u2019t celebrate EAD.\n  * 84% of workers at companies that celebrate EAD say that they regularly hear about the accomplishments of people within their organisation, as opposed to only 49% of those who work at companies that don\u2019t celebrate EAD.\n  * 77% of employees at companies that celebrate EAD feel that their leaders acknowledge the great work they do, as opposed to just 49% at companies that don\u2019t celebrate EAD.\n\nIn line with this, Gary Beckstrand, Vice President at O.C. Tanner, suggested\nfour easy and inexpensive ways to celebrate EAD:\n\n  * Give employees the afternoon off, or let them pick a day in March to take off for a few hours.\n  * Announce the ways you\u2019ll show appreciation moving forward and on a regular basis. For example, thank-you cards, company events, free lunches, etc.\n  * Schedule a day for team-bonding activities that focus on having fun with coworkers (and not on work).\n  * Bring in homemade baked goods and set aside time for an employee 'happy hour' to socialise over food during the work day.\n\n**ALSO READ:**\n\n  * [Employee Appreciation Day special: 8 leaders on their favourite forms of

research is clear \u2013 employee recognition appears consistently near the top\nof things that motivate employees to do their best work.\n\nFor many workers, it means more than even a financial reward. And research\nindicates that cash rewards can actually be counter-productive if they aren\u2019t\ncombined with other ways of recognizing hard work.\n\nA [Wharton School study](http://www.cfozone.com/index.php/Newsflash/Why-\nexecutive-compensation-needs-non-financial-incentives.html) showed that\nrelying solely on cash rewards encourages:\n\n    * resentment from hard-working staffers who wind up earning less\n    * workers who cut corners, and\n    * a lack of unity, as most employees are only interested in taking part in activities that directly contribute to them earning more.\n\nThe study found organizations get better results when they:\n\n    * provide more autonomy to employees who\u2019ve proven they can manage themselves\n    * offer the opportunity to earn certifications or attend seminars, trade shows and/or conferences, and\n    * hold public recognition ceremonies.\n\nAnd that\u2019s good news \u2014 every HR pro knows how tough it can be to find the\nbudget and leadership buy-in for even occasional cash rewards.\n\nBut it\u2019s still a challenge keeping recognition and reward programs fresh. So\nhow do you keep your workforce [engaged ](http://www.hrmorning.com/news/and-\nthe-key-to-employee-engagement-is/)and committed to your organization\u2019s goals?\n\nHere are five great ideas straight from HRMorning\u2019s readers.\n\n## 1.   Peer recognition\n\nWe put a lot of effort into making our new hires feel welcome, but we also\nknew we needed to focus on keeping our current employees happy to hang onto\nthem.\n\nSo we formed a \u201cFun Raising\u201d team, dedicated to creating fun employee-\nrecognition and appreciation activities.\n\nThe team puts on events like pop-up escape rooms, free ice cream days and\ncompany spirit weeks.\n\nThe program got a terrific employee response, but we wanted to help our\nworkers show appreciation toward each other as well.\n\n### Kudos for colleagues\n\nWe launched \u201cKudos for Colleagues\u201d with a huge kickoff event and an all-day\ndrop-in party in the HR department. But the Kudos Cards were the most\nimportant part.\n\nEmployees fill out the cards with the name of a co-worker and what makes them\nawesome at their job.\n\n### A pleasant surprise\n\nA randomly-chosen monthly winner receives a trophy and prize to share with\ntheir department.\n\nWe profile the winner in our employee newsletter and post their photo on a\n\u201cwall of fame\u201d.\n\nAnd everyone who receives a nomination gets the card with their co-worker\u2019s\ncompliment.\n\n### Fun, but effective\n\nSince starting Kudos for Colleagues, we\u2019ve received at least 40 nominations\neach month. Sometimes, we\u2019ll get as many as 100 out of an employee pool of\nabout 500.\n\nWith employees recognizing and complimenting each other, our workplace is\nreally supportive and positive.\n\nManagers report morale and enthusiasm are strong and that they are seeing\nemployees going above and beyond in providing customer service.\n\nAnd we can measure the results in concrete terms, too: retention is vastly\nimproved since we started the program.\n\n_(HR manager, Champaign, IL)_\n\n## 2.   Power to the people\n\nStudies show that employees want to work in an environment where they are\nbeing recognized regularly for their significant achievements and strong\nperformance.\n\nBut our annual employee engagement survey scores for employee recognition were\nconsistently lower than we wanted. We needed a new, unconventional way to\nreward and recognize our employees for extraordinary performance.\n\n### Superheroes and superheroines\n\nRealizing that our top performers demonstrated many of the\ncharacteristics/behavior of famous superheroes and super heroines, we came up\nwith The LOOT Awards (a.k.a. The LOOTies), which stands for the League of\nOverachieving Talent.\n\nThe LOOTies allow employees to reward and recognize anyone for anything\nanytime, irrespective of the person\u2019s level, seniority, or department.\n\nIf someone witnesses extraordinary performance, great collaboration, or\nanything that reflects our company culture, they can log into the secured site\nand, in a matter of 5 minutes, recognize those extraordinary efforts for all\nto see.\n\nThere are three different ways we recognize employees, two of which must be\napproved by our leadership:\n\n    * **P-Cubed (Powerful Performance Points) Award:** Employees can be nominated to receive a certain number of powerful performance points or PPPs that can be redeemed for merchandise, VISA gift cards, or donations to charity (some of which we match).\n    *  **P-Squared (Performance Perks) Award: E** mployees are nominated to receive a specific perk, such as days off, a dinner for two or an iTunes gift card. \n    * **Chants & Cheers (C & C) Award:** These awards don\u2019t require approval. They give peers and managers the chance to say, \u201cYou rock,\u201d \u201cJob well done,\u201d or \u201cWay-to-go!\u201d right when an employer earns that recognition.\n\nThe program was a hit from day one.\n\n_(Senior VP, People and Culture,   San Francisco)_\n\n## 3.   Individual attention\n\nWe had a serious turnover problem \u2013 and we didn\u2019t know why.\n\nWhen we had turnover problems in the past, companywide morale boosters usually\nseemed to right the ship.\n\nBut those employee recognition ideas weren\u2019t working anymore, and we were\nlosing staffers at a rapid clip.\n\nLooking at the type of employees who were leaving, we realized that the\nmajority were younger \u2013 Millennials, Gen X, Gen Z.\n\nThat gave us an idea about how we could tackle the problem.\n\n### **Brought it to a smaller scale**\n\nThe solution: Instead of trying to prevent turnover at a company-wide level,\nwe instructed managers to focus more on individual young employees and how\nsupervisors can help them stay engaged in their jobs.\n\nFor one employee, the solution was to allow him to start projects from scratch\nand see them all the way through to completion.\n\nAnother worker said her job satisfaction rose considerably when she had the\nopportunity to mentor a new staffer who was just learning the ropes.\n\nThe goal \u2013 to keep staff members challenged \u2013 worked perfectly.\n\nThe proof is in the numbers: That extra attention has slowed turnover\nconsiderably.\n\n_(HR manager, Atlanta)_\n\n## 4.   Monthly employee recognition reports\n\nWe wanted to improve our company culture by promoting daily successes of our\nemployees.\n\nPreviously, we used a private Twitter feed for employee recognition. We were\nlooking for the next step beyond our homegrown employee recognition program.\n\nOur strategy: We wanted to produce monthly reports on top-recognized employees\nand send those out from within Yammer, our in-house communication network.\n\nWe found an employee recognition app that was easy to use and allowed us to\nsend employee \u201cshout-outs\u201d through Yammer.\n\nTo personalize the experience and incentivize corporate behavior, our vendor\nhelped us come up with custom badges that represent our values, such as Hero\nMaker, Ducks in a Row and Knowledge Whisperer.\n\nThese values can be tracked and promoted through the app. Plus, the app helps\nstaff send and track recognition.\n\nCorporate well-being and staff attitude continue to be high.\n\n### Best month ever\n\nWithin the first month of using the app, we reported our best month ever in\nrevenue. Even with a remote staff, company culture is going strong.\n\nWe now send over 200 recognitions a month \u2013 double what we sent out before.\n\nNot to mention, our sales have increased by 40% since we started our program!\n\n_(COO, Jenkintown, PA)_\n\n## 5.   An experience bonus instead of cash\n\nIn years past, we\u2019d given out holiday bonuses or gifts to our employees, but\nwe really wanted to do something more meaningful in terms of employee\nrecognition.\n\nOne of the core values of our company is customer experience, and we wanted\nthat to be reflected in what we offered our employees.\n\nWe came up with an \u201cexperience bonus\u201d program to give our employees the\nopportunity to cross something off their bucket lists that they might\notherwise never do.\n\nAll employees who\u2019ve been with us for more than a year get the annual bonus.\n\nThere are no guidelines other than the money can\u2019t be spent on an item, it can\nonly be used to pay for an experience.\n\nThey let us know what they plan to do and when they are doing it, and we\ndeposit the bonus into their accounts.\n\nThe hardest part was coming up with the amount of the bonuses. It had to be\nfinancially comfortable for the company but enough that employees could do\nsomething truly special. We settled on $1,500.\n\nAfter that, it was as simple as getting the word out about the program and\ntransferring money into accounts.\n\n### Variety of experiences\n\nWhen we said the experience could be anything our employees wanted, we meant\nit, and it\u2019s been fun to see what people do with their $1,500.\n\nAn avid skier fulfilled a dream of going to a ski resort in Austria.\n\nAnother employee traveled to East Africa and helped launch a charity that has\nraised over $4,000 for a local orphanage.\n\nA third bought front row tickets to take family to a Justin Timberlake\nconcert.\n\n### Defining company culture\n\nEmployees come back from their experiences excited to share their adventure.\nWe constantly hear people discussing what they did with their bonuses and what\nthey plan to do next.\n\nAnd not only is it a morale booster, but it\u2019s also helped us attract new\ntalent.\n\nYounger workers are a huge part of the workforce now, and many of them value\nexperiences over material things. The experience bonus is a unique employee\nrecognition benefit that also gives candidates a preview of our company\nculture.\n\n_(Head of global insights, Provo, UT)_\n\n![Tim\nMcElgunn](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Tim\nMcElgunn](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Tim\nMcElgunn](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/newtimart-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Tim McElgunn](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/tmcelgunn/)\n\nTim, a member of the HRMorning staff, is a veteran writer and editor.

Gift certificates or online\nspaces where employees can recognize their colleagues\u2019 actions that made their\nco-workers\u2019 work-lives better? Free pizza for lunch or company groups that\nconnect motorcycle enthusiasts?\n\nOkay, those are trick questions. The answer is, of course, both, not either.\nTangible and intangible rewards have long been valid ways for savvy employers\nto recognize worker accomplishments and contributions, especially on the first\nFriday of March, which has been Employee Appreciation Day for the last 25\nyears.\n\nFor HR strategists whose primary directive is to attract and retain the best\ntalent and to engage and motivate people to bring their best selves to work,\nevery day should include behaviors that make it feel like an Employee\nAppreciation Day. Just maybe without all the stuff.\n\n\u201cSometimes the stuff loses its appeal and can almost feel burdensome,\u201d says\nRachel Light, director of Global Employee Experience at [Cornerstone On\nDemand](https://hrexecutive.com/cornerstone-to-buy-talent-management-\ndeveloper-saba/), the cloud-based learning and talent management company. \u201cBut\nwhat I truly find inspires me are words of affirmation and being recognized\nfor a job that I\u2019m doing well.\u201d\n\n**See also:[The importance of distinguishing appreciation from\nrecognition](https://hrexecutive.com/the-importance-of-distinguishing-\nappreciation-from-recognition/)**\n\nThat\u2019s a theme shared at many other companies, including 15Five, an employee\nperformance management platform company.\n\n\u201cPeople in general crave to feel valued and [have] a sense of belonging,\u201d says\nHeidi Collins, vice president of People Operations at 15Five. \u201cTo do this, you\nhave to cultivate a culture of psychological safety, for the person to really\nfeel of value. When someone has executed something you asked them to do,\ninstead of simply saying thank you, share how it impacted you, why it was so\nhelpful. It\u2019s a way to show appreciation that isn\u2019t generic and won\u2019t be\ninsincere.\u201d\n\nAt Cornerstone, this year\u2019s Employee Appreciation Day will kick off a\nmonthlong #EmployeeAppreciation campaign on the company\u2019s employee online\nspace, allowing employees to share good stories about each other. It's a\nstrategy designed to particularly engage remote employees, who make up about\n39% of Cornerstone\u2019s workforce.\n\n\u201cThere will be a living space where people can make notes about someone that\nthey care about, something that they've done for them, a way they've had an\nimpact on their career, and why they appreciate them,\u201d Light says.\n\n**Read also:[Coronavirus: Why employers need to strike a balance on\ncommunication](https://hrexecutive.com/coronavirus-why-employers-need-to-\nstrike-a-balance-on-communication/)**\n\nCollins says that beyond Employee Appreciation Day, one of the biggest HR\nchallenges to improve employee appreciation is consistency. \u201cWhen we train our\nmanagers, we have a checklist for things to check in on a daily basis, weekly\nbasis, monthly basis, yearly, etc. We have things that are important to do\nregularly because this is how you keep your employees motivated and valued.\u201d\n\nTelling managers explicitly what the company expects can feel like extra work\nto some managers, but it\u2019s about driving home the message that it\u2019s not just\nabout team performance but also about the manager\u2019s ability to care about,\nsupport and coach team members, Collins says.\n\n  * ![Frustration](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Frustration.png)\n  * ![Recognition](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/plugins/soliloquy/assets/css/images/holder.gif)\n  * ![Retention](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/plugins/soliloquy/assets/css/images/holder.gif)\n  * ![Turnover](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/plugins/soliloquy/assets/css/images/holder.gif)\n\n![Frustration](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Frustration.png)![Recognition](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Recognition.png)![Retention](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Retention.png)![Turnover](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Turnover.png)\n\n\u201cSometimes we feel like we have to spend a lot of money or time to make people\nfeel appreciated and seen, but it\u2019s simpler than that, and we need to\nconsistently provide this appreciation/gratitude. Tools like 15Five are\nhelpful, but really as long as you are keeping up with your people regularly,\nthey will know you care,\u201d Collins adds.\n\nLight notes that Cornerstone spends a lot of time making sure policies and\nbenefits meet the personal needs of employees. \u201cWe know that in order for an\nemployee to be appreciated, we actually need to appreciate them as a person\nand a human being,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo we need to understand who they are at\ntheir core before we attempt to offer them great perks or benefits at the\noffice.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one reason the company\u2019s employee affinity groups go beyond business-\nrelated categories such as diversity and inclusion to topics that tap into\npeople\u2019s personal passions, such as the motorcycle enthusiasts\u2019 group.\n\n\u201cThe result of a beautiful employee resource group like this is that they wind\nup sharing different rides that they've been on [and] pictures of their\nexperiences,\u201d says Light, whose company\u2019s workforce spans 21 markets in 15\ncountries. \u201cSomething like riding a motorcycle that would never come up in a\nbusiness discussion has allowed people around the world to connect in ways\nthey never imagined.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cWe realized that we need to take care of the whole person and\nbecause of technology these days, people are taking their work home with them.\nSo we really have become more open to them bringing what feels like home to\nthe office.\u201d\n\n[**More _HRE_ coverage of Talent\nManagement**](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/)\n\nThat brings up the idea of free food \u2026 and beyond, says Light. \u201cFood is always\na way to people's hearts, so we want to ensure that they feel the love, but\nthe truth is that we don't limit our efforts to an Employee Appreciation Day.\nIn order to run a successful company, we need to ensure that our employees\nfeel appreciated every day. I'm constantly trying to gather feedback and input\nfrom them to ensure that we're keeping up with what they desire and to ensure\nthat our attempts to appreciate and to show how grateful we are doesn't get\nstale as the employee changes or their objectives change.\u201d\n\nFinally, Collins notes that basic politeness and social niceties can go\nfarther than you think to develop a culture of appreciation.\n\n\u201cWhen reaching out and asking for info from employees or asking them to do\nsomething,\u201d she suggests, \u201cespecially over instant messaging apps or email, it\nmakes a difference to start off with a nice greeting to make it more human,\nlike, \u2018How\u2019s your day,\u2019 [or] \u2018How was your trip?\u2019 Acknowledging people can\nmake the world of a difference.\u201d\n\nAnd that can make every day a true Employee Appreciation Day.\n\nMaura Ciccarelli is freelance writer based in Southeastern Pennsylvania.

and\nretention](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/content_images/statistics_for_employee_recognition_and_retention_5e4e903c0e87c.jpg)\n\n**_By retaining high-potential employees, companies can build a robust talent\npipeline and save millions in hiring/training costs. In this article, we\ndiscuss six statistics that demonstrate the impact of recognition on\nretention_**\n\nLet\u2019s get right down to it: turnover is a major problem that is costing\ncompanies millions of dollars every year. [Gallup\nestimates](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/247391/fixable-problem-costs-\nbusinesses-trillion.aspx) that it can cost twice the annual salary of an\nemployee to replace them. It also says that U.S. businesses lose $1 trillion\nper year due to voluntary turnover!\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834dc302698.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nTo reduce turnover and increase [employee\nretention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/), companies must invest in\nthe right HR strategies. One such strategy that has gained popularity is\nemployee rewards and recognition. By recognizing employee achievements and\nrewarding exceptional performance, companies hope to boost loyalty and make\ntheir workforces more retention friendly.\n\nBut does this method really work?\n\nThe answer is a definitive YES. Today, we look at six findings from research\nand industry surveys that prove how frequent and strategic recognition could\nhelp your retention efforts.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How to Retain Top Talent with Employee Recognition: Q &A;\nWith Cord Himelstein of Halo\nRecognition**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/rewards-and-\nrecognition/cord-himelstein-halo-recognition-top-talent/)\n\n## **Employee Recognition and Retention Are Linked and These Statistics Prove\nIt**\n\nEmployee recognition means highlighting positive behavior and efforts in the\nworkplace, both in terms of personal traits and professional achievements.\n\nBy recognizing your employees regularly, you can foster a sense of engagement\nwith the work, where employees feel truly motivated to work hard and stay with\nthe company. And this can go a long way in [improving your retention\nrates](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/6-practical-tips-for-retaining-employees-in-2020/).\n\nHere are six statistics that show how employee recognition can bring down\nturnover at your company.\n\n### **1\\. 63% of employees who are recognized are very unlikely to look for a\nnew job**\n\n  \n[SurveyMonkey partnered with\nBonusly](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/employee-recognition-and-\nretention/) to find out how recognition and retention are related. Out of\n1,500 respondents, 63% of those who were \u201calways\u201d or \u201cusually\u201d recognized said\nthat they are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to job hunt in the next 3\u20136 months. In contrast,\nonly 11% of those who are \u201cnever\u201d or \u201crarely\u201d recognized would agree.\n\nRegular employee recognition instills a sense of purpose in your workforce.\nThey are, therefore, less likely to seek more meaningful opportunities outside\nthe organization. Further, it builds a line of communication where employees\nwould seek new growth opportunities within the company, without considering a\nseparation.\n\n### **2\\. 40% of employed Americans would put energy into their work if they\nwere recognized more often**\n\n  \nA [survey by OGO](https://hbr.org/2016/05/recognizing-employees-is-the-\nsimplest-way-to-improve-morale) found that the lack of recognition has a\nmassively negative impact on how employees feel about the workplace. According\nto the survey, 82% of American professionals feel that they aren\u2019t adequately\nrecognized for their contribution. This could easily lead to turnover.\n\nBy ensuring that your employees are properly recognized, you encourage them to\nbring their best to work every day. This statistic shows exactly how\nrecognition and morale are related. In the long run, low morale will only lead\nto a dip in employee enthusiasm, paving the way for\n[attrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-attrition-complete-guide/).\n\n### **3\\. Employees promoted after three years have a 70% possibility of\nstaying with your company**\n\n  \n[LinkedIn surveyed ](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-\nsolutions/blog/trends-and-research/2019/3-factors-linked-to-better-employee-\nretention)32 million employee profiles to create a retention curve,\npinpointing the reasons for staying on with a company. The study found a\ndirect link between retention and promotion, one of the most common ways in\nwhich your top-performing employees are recognized. In contrast, employees\nwithout a change in job roles have only a 45% possibility of retention after\nthree years.\n\nAs this statistic suggests, apart from occasional rewards and [social\nrecognition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-\nrecognition/what-is-social-recognition/), promotions/career progression is a\nvital recognition method. It tells employees that the company believes in its\npotential and is ready to invest in their future.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **20 Memorable Employee Appreciation Day Ideas for\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/20-memorable-employee-appreciation-day-ideas-for-2020/)\n\n### **4\\. 52% of employees feel that their rewards strategy isn\u2019t aligned to\norganizational goals**\n\n  \n[Deloitte\u2019s survey](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-\ncapital-trends.html) of 9,400 business and HR respondents revealed that\nemployees aren\u2019t happy with the alignment of the rewards strategy with\norganizational. Specifically, 38% said it was only \u201csomewhat aligned\u201d while\n14% said it was not \u201caligned\u201d at all.\n\nWith high turnover rates, companies must revisit their rewards programs in the\ncontext of their organizational roadmap. To boost retention, it is vital to go\nbeyond \u201ctrendy\u201d perks or occasional gifts and adopt a formalized recognition\nstrategy. Instead, they need to view rewards more holistically, using it to\nmotivate employees and foster meaningful workplace relationships.\n\n### **5\\. The lack of recognition and engagement is driving 44% of employees\nto switch jobs**\n\n  \nA [survey by Achievers](https://www.achievers.com/press/achievers-survey-\nfinds-without-recognition-expect-employee-attrition-2018/) spanning 1,700\nrespondents found a clear link between\n[rewards/recognition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/3-ways-ai-will-impact-employee-rewards-and-recognition/) and\nretention. 55% of respondents were planning to switch jobs, and the lack of\nrecognition was the No.1 reason. 69% even said that better rewards and\nrecognition would encourage them to stay on at the company.\n\nThe inference from this statistic is pretty simple \u2013 implement [performance\nmanagement tools](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/agile-performance-management-software/) to monitor performance\nand highlight exceptional instances. Then, publicly and privately appreciate\nemployees for their efforts. It's also a good idea to recognize employees via\nweekly feedback meetings, even if there hasn\u2019t been an instance of exceptional\nperformance. This will keep your average performers motivated and eager to do\nbetter.\n\n### **6\\. Retention is a key objective for 60% of employee recognition\nprograms**\n\n  \nInterestingly, companies are aware of the relationship between retention and\nrecognition. This is why increasing retention/decreasing turnover is a key\nprogram objective for 60% of recognition activities, finds a\n[survey](https://www.worldatwork.org/press-room/worldatwork-and-maritz-\nmotivation-release-results-of-2019-trends-in-employee-recognition-survey) of\n472 respondents by WorldatWork. In fact, 23% of companies even use a reduction\nin turnover to measure the success of their retention program.\n\nGoing forward, strategic employee recognition with a keen eye on\nretention/turnover containment will be an HR staple. You could even implement\n[predictive analytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-\nanalytics/5-hr-essentials-that-predictive-analytics-will-transform-\ncompletely/) to [identify flight risk\nemployees](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-to-\nidentify-flightrisk-employees/) and deploy an employee-specific recognition\nplan. This will help to cut down turnover for high-performing, high-value\ntalent.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is Employee Appreciation?

This makes it critical for employers to improve and\nmaintain their retention rates, without falling prey to attrition.\n\nSeveral companies have already got it right. [Zappos, GE, and Apple (among\nothers) have a stellar recognition\nprogram](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/employee-recognition-strategy-examples/) that can curb\nattrition and ensure retention. So, in 2020, double-down on employee surveys\nat the offboarding stage and pinpoint the root cause of turnover.\n\nThis will help you reimagine your employee recognition program and\nintelligently deploy rewards, promotions, and other recognition elements for\nmaximum retention.\n\n_Have you used employee recognition as a retention tool?

I often wondered. If everybody\ncomes to work and gets paid a salary, why then do people need to be\nappreciated for doing something that is already a part of their KRA? Why does\nit make a difference whether or not an employee gets the credit for surpassing\nexpectations?\n\n_Leadership expert Dale Carnegie says \u201cPeople work for money but go the extra\nmile for recognition, praise, and rewards.\u201d_\n\nAccording to a recent survey, 31 percent [employees seek\nappreciation](https://www.exoplatform.com/employee-recognition/) at work from\ntheir immediate bosses. It isn\u2019t merely a question of praise versus criticism.\nInstead, it is a direct reflection on boosting the morale of the workforce, to\nkeep them engaged and the levels of productivity at a constant high. It\u2019s a\nmatter of instilling a sense of pride that inspires them to be loyal and\npassionate about the work that they do.\n\nIt intrigued me when a friend of mine from the States mentioned that the US\nobserves first Friday in the month of March as [Employee Appreciation\nDay](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/20-memorable-\nemployee-appreciation-day-ideas-for-2020/). Although unofficial, I believe\nthat such a simple initiative can make a huge impact on a lot of aspirational\nminds.\n\nOver a period of time, I have realized how organizations that have invested in\ncreating a culture of recognition have witnessed a tremendous boost in\nproductivity levels. Because appreciating one employee also becomes\nmotivational for fellow teammates.\n\nHere are five [employee recognition\nideas](https://www.exoplatform.com/employee-recognition/) that could make a\nreal difference in the workplace that I have encountered.\n\n## **1\\. Happiness Chequebook**\n\nOne of the most popular ways of appreciation is public recognition. Feedback\nis more impactful when given in person, but recognition is more effective when\ngiven in front of the entire team. What can really make this recognition\nworthy, is complementing it with a Value Cheque? It may just be a sheet of\npaper that says \u2018Your boss thinks that you\u2019re a Rockstar\u2019 or something that\nsays \u2018You\u2019ve done a great job! Coffee on me.\u2019 But when given in front of a\ngroup with a thundering round of applause, it definitely becomes a great\nmorale booster.\n\n## **2\\. Personalized Giveaways**\n\nGone are the days when companies had a standard reward for employees. Today,\norganizations go the extra mile to ensure that each reward being given out\noffers a personal touch \u2013 Be it a signed personal letter from a senior leader,\na caricature made into a 3D cut-out, or even a customized visiting card-\nholder. The thought itself enhances an employees\u2019 passion to work and drives\nthem to show up every day with a smile and take on new challenges. Besides, it\nis also a great way to strengthen employer branding with everyday brand\nrecall.\n\n## **3\\. Going Live Across Social**\n\nRight from \u2018Best Employee Of The Month\u2019, to \u2018Employee With Maximum Peer\nRecommendations\u2019, companies are investing in optimizing their people value.\nAlong with posters going live on the intranet, the same also gets shared on\nFacebook and other social media platforms. Professionals log onto LinkedIn to\nconnect with each other, and a public announcement on such an impactful\nplatform means a lot. Companies can also include a section in their broadcast\nnewsletters that get shared with stakeholders, clients, as well as customers.\n\n## **4\\. App For Instant Testimonial**\n\nWith the data of employees available on internal portals, HR teams should\nconsider designing a mobile app, where peers can share instant recommendations\nand appreciations for their fellow colleagues. A mini-Facebook in itself,\nthese recommendations can then be converted into points that upon reaching a\ncertain score, get converted into rewards and are redeemable across platforms\n\u2013 Either at the office canteen or at affiliated partner stores and outlets.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is Employee Appreciation? Definition, Strategies, and\nIdeas, With Examples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-appreciation-definition-strategies-ideas/)**\n\n## **5\\. Interactive Gamification**\n\nImagine a live dashboard to track the performance of the employee that works\nin the form of a league/championship, whose results get declared every\nquarter! This can even work wonders for teams and act as a great motivation\nfor low performing employees. From incorporating quizzes to refreshing\nknowledge about internal operations to presenting live badges at every level\ncrossed and landmark achieved; gamification is an engaging way to ensure that\nevery employee receives constant recognition based on their merit.\n\nWith the incorporation of flexible work timings and work from home aspects\nbeing incorporated in the office policies, companies have taken the first step\ntowards a people-centric work culture. Further, organizations are also\nconsidering fusing Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality into their\nEmployee Value Propositions, to ensure holistic development and wellness of\ntheir employees.\n\nIn 2016, Facebook launched the Workplace.

It's peer-to-peer, and it matches\nvalues with concrete, observable behaviours, according to Adan.\n\n\"This provides anyone in the business - from a board member to an employee -\nthousands of examples of what great looks like for your people,\" she said.\n\n\"By highlighting what is being accomplished in real-time, across the entire\nbusiness, it can be a driving force for improvement and can also provide\nincredible insight into what's working in your organisation.\"\n\nFor Adan, one of the big advantages of having a strategic recognition program\nis that it allows people from different departments to recognise the work of\npeers they don't normally sit or collaborate with on a regular basis.\n\n\"This is often a big challenge for growing organisations, and ones that are\ngeographically dispersed,\" she said.\n\n\"If it's delivered digitally and includes a social component where recognition\nmoments are visible across the business, strategic R&R programs communicate\nthe variety of things people across the company are achieving on a daily\nbasis, which improves transparency and understanding across multiple levels.\"\n\nAdan added that having access to information about team interactions and\nperformance empowers employees and leaders to make better and faster\ndecisions.\n\n\"Strategic recognition also shines the light on who your involved and\npotential leaders are, while even the absence of recognition activity amongst\ncertain teams or leaders shines a light on the areas of the business that are\ndisengaged and need support,\" she said.\n\n\"It's powerful because it can provide a 360-degree view of your business even\nwhen you aren't physically visiting or working in every team or every site.\"\n\n**Joy Adan will be speaking on

Fina Recognition (now HALO\nRecognition), who had up until then relied on outside creative agencies.\n\nSince that time, we\u2019ve built a full in-house marketing team to support all our\nclients\u2019 recognition marketing needs and implemented new demand generation\ninitiatives leveraging a powerful Martech stack. Since becoming part of HALO\nBranded Solutions, my role has expanded further into developing strategic\ndigital initiatives, as well as broader recognition marketing programs for our\nclients.\n\n_**Which are the top 3 best practices that can help organizations deliver\nrecognition and incentives to their employees, especially for millennials and\nGeneration Z?**_\n\n  * **Involve senior leaders:** The most effective recognition programs feature strong support from the top of the organization. Without clear support and participation from senior leadership, it can be difficult to get employees to take the program seriously. The best way to change culture is by example, and the most effective examples come from the top.\n  * **Plan for remote and global employees:** Recognition programs should unify your workforce under a banner of common values, but it can be difficult to include workers who are not \u201cwhere the action is\u201d. The employee experience of receiving recognition should be consistent for all employees, no matter where they are located. Remote positions are fast-growing and heavily occupied by millennials and gen Z.\n  * **Use a variety of recognition channels:** Younger generations are used to being engaged by multiple media channels and respond well to recognition that is delivered in more than one way. We see achievement-based rewards program gain better traction when using an omnichannel approach.\n\n  \n**Learn More:**[ **Why Employee Retention Techniques Are So Important: Q &A;\nWith Salesforce\u2019s Ana\nRecio**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/recruitment-onboarding/ana-\nrecio-salesforce-employee-retention-techniques/)\n\n_**Do the recognition and incentive models need to be different for\nmillennials and gen Z?**_\n\nGenerational recognition has always been a best practice in rewards and\nincentives, so many models account for generational motivators. The biggest\nconsiderations for millennials and gen Z are making the program accessible\nfrom a mobile device and including ways to socialize and share achievements.\n\n> **They also tend to look for more emotional intelligence in their leaders,\n> so training managers in that respect can be extra beneficial. Overall, the\n> biggest motivator for employees of any generation is creating an open and\n> supportive environment where everyone is rewarded equally for adding\n> value.**\n\n_**What the top 3 mistakes you see organizations making in keeping employees\nfeeling valued and happy at work?**_\n\n  * **No human connection:** Too often recognition is used as a crutch to prop up an unsatisfying culture, when it should be leveraged to change that culture from the inside out, starting with the behavior of leadership. Managers may give recognition like clockwork but fail to engage their staff on a human level and build real relationships, which in the end is a more powerful motivator than material rewards.\n  * **Inconsistent:** A heavily marketed recognition program may start off with a bang, but it takes daily upkeep and genuine personal interest to sustain it over the long term. This means recognizing employees in a timely and regular fashion and taking time to check in with them to ask if they feel valued and happy!\n  * **Inferior or not enough rewards:** Employees can always tell when the bare minimum is being spent to keep them around and get wise to it quickly. It behooves organizations to value achievements appropriately and offer other low- or no-cost means to express daily gratitude. Holistic and thoughtful program design is necessary to strike the proper balance between budget and experience.\n\n  \n**Learn More:**[ **Automation in HR is Key to Digital Transformation: Q &A;\nwith Olivier Blum of Schneider\nElectric**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/digital-\ntransformation/olivier-blum-on-automation-in-hr/)\n\n_**How can emerging technologies such as AI and ML help talent leaders improve\nemployee engagement?**_\n\nThere are still a lot of unknowns as to how AI and ML will impact employee\nengagement, and many people are trying to find that answer. AI-powered tools\nlike chatbots and behavior mapping are already widely used to give employees\nand employers more real-time feedback on things like performance and training.\n\n> **Predictive analytics enable companies to streamline things like onboarding\n> and talent management, all of which stand to influence engagement. AI and ML\n> will never replace genuine human interactions, but they are extremely\n> helpful for gathering data on how your workforce thinks and learns, which\n> can translate to more personalized strategies.**\n\n_**In today\u2019s gig economy, what impact will a distributed workforce have on\nhow HR managers approach incentives and recognition models in their companies?\nWhat can be done to nurture this workforce?**_\n\nI think the gig economy is already having a large impact on recognition and\nreshaping the role of recognition providers in the process.\n\nArguably it\u2019s what\u2019s driving recognition programs to become more consolidated\nand capable of delivering recognition through all available channels.\n\nIn the past recognition providers were mere suppliers, but now they fill a\nconsultative role in designing enterprise-wide programs that are tied to\norganizational goals. Continuing to nurture that collaborative relationship\nwith recognition providers can ensure HR always has the best tools to include\nand engage remote staff.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How to Craft Effective Employee Retention Strategies: Q &A;\nwith Gina Lau of Scoop**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/employee-\nengagement/hrtech-interview-gina-lau-employee-retention-strategies/)\n\n_**What\u2019s the recognition model like at HALO? How do you make use of your own\npractices to reinforce a positive and inclusive work culture?**_\n\nWe have a best practice recognition program that includes service awards,\ndaily achievement awards, no-cost eCards, and social recognition tools, among\nother things. We too have a considerable segment of remote workers, and they\nhave full accessibility to the program.\n\nWe have worked hard over the decades to build a supportive culture, and we use\nthe program to reinforce those values.\n\nManagement takes a serious approach to being emotionally intelligent and\navailable to employees when they have concerns or challenges. Additionally, we\nlearn more about engaging our own employees every day from working with\ncustomers and designing novel solutions.\n\n_**Can you give us a sneak-peek into the upcoming projects at HALO on employee\nrecognition and incentives that you are most excited about?**_\n\nI am very excited to share our expanded offerings with our clients and the\nmarketplace. Our full-fledged company stores, and branded merchandise\ncapabilities can help enhance recognition and incentive strategies to provide\na truly consolidated platform for all things related to the employee\nexperience.\n\n_**As we head towards 2020, which are the key trends you are keen on tracking\nin this space?**_\n\nRecognition programs are becoming more consolidated, universal and mission-\ncritical to the overall HR strategy. Workforces become more remote and\ndistributed every year, and as such continue to require more creative and\nflexible platforms.\n\nThe concept of the \u201cemployee experience\u201d is supplanting \u201cemployee engagement\u201d\nas the primary goal of recognition, and we continue to align our efforts to be\na true single-source provider in that respect.\n\n**_Neha:_** _Thank you, Cord for sharing your valuable insights on how\nemployee recognition incentives can influence talent retention.

holding back your\nworkforce from being productive? Employee Appreciation Day 2020 is a great\ntime to address this issue, with memorable ideas that leave an impact.

Unemployment rates, especially for high-demand skills, are\nnow at an all-time low. By regularly appreciating your employees, you can\ncreate a culture of engagement and foster a sense of loyalty to the company.\n\nAnd this goes beyond the usual \u201cemployee of the month\u201d and occasional gift\ncards. You need employee appreciation ideas that truly stand out and leave an\nimpression.\n\n## **Table of Contents**\n\n  * **Why You Should Celebrate Employee Appreciation Day**\n  * **20 Ways to Appreciate Your Employees March 6, 2020**\n  * **Wrapping Up: Making Every Day Employee Appreciation Day**\n\n##  \n**Why You Should Celebrate Employee Appreciation Day**\n\nEmployee Appreciation Day is becoming increasingly important for companies for\nseveral reasons. Celebrating such events can help you retain top talent by\nrecognizing employee contributions, and it also improves company culture.\n\nYet, the current state of employee appreciation in the workplace doesn\u2019t look\npromising: as illustrated by:\n\n  * In a [TINYpulse survey](https://www.tinypulse.com/2019-employee-engagement-report) with 200,000+ responses, only a quarter feel like they are highly valued at work. That means approximately 75% of employees regularly feel underappreciated.\n  * In the same survey, only a third of the respondents said that they were appreciated the last time they went the extra mile for their job.\n\n  \nDoes this mean you need massive investments to appreciate, engage and retain\nyour employees? Not necessarily.\n\n  * A [Deloitte survey](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/time-to-rethink-employee-recognition-strategy.html) of 16,000 professionals found that 54% would be happy with a verbal \u201cthank you.\u201d\n  * Another 31% would like a written \u201cthank you\u201d in order to feel appreciated!\n\n  \nAs these trends highlight, companies need to do little to appreciate their\nemployees, but getting creative with Employee Appreciation Day ideas can do so\nmuch more for employee engagement in 2020.\n\nCelebrated on the first Friday in March, there\u2019s plenty of time for you to\nplan, select the necessary tools, and make Employee Appreciation Day a huge\nsuccess. Here are 20 ideas to make it happen. ****\n\n## **20 Ways to Appreciate Your Employees on Employee Appreciation Day**\n\nThe idea of Employee Appreciation Day isn\u2019t new. It was first conceptualized\nin 1995, by one of the founding board members of Recognitions Professionals\nInternational, together with his publishing company.\n\nSince then, it has steadily gained momentum, taking on a new dimension in the\n21st century. Today, with companies across the globe vying to become an\n\u201cEmployer of Choice,\u201d the right Employee Appreciation Day idea can make a big\ndifference to your employer brand. Here are 20 strategies to consider, with\nexamples from the world\u2019s leading companies.\n\n### **1\\. Have your CEO personally appreciate good work, like Apple**\n\n  \nEmployee appreciation shouldn\u2019t be a formal process, with events held once or\ntwice a year. Your employees want to hear from senior leadership and know that\nthey are making a genuine difference to the company\u2019s business growth.\n\nA great idea to explore for Employee Appreciation Day is a direct \u201cThank You\u201d\nfrom the CEO. This is even more important for large companies where a sense of\nownership and belonging can be difficult to achieve. That\u2019s why Apple\u2019s CEO,\nTim Cook, regularly calls out exemplary work done by the company\u2019s global\nteam. He even turns into a social post, enabling public recognition.\n\n> Thank you to our outstanding retail teams around the world. Your contagious\n> energy and passion represent the best of Apple. It\u2019s a privilege to work\n> with all of you. [pic.twitter.com/zTo89YMsvK](https://t.co/zTo89YMsvK)\n>\n> \u2014 Tim Cook (@tim_cook) [December 27,\n> 2018](https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1078318631727976448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n###  \n**2\\. Conduct a treasure hunt, like Confidence Center**\n\n  \nSometimes, a creative and slightly uncommon Employee Appreciation Day idea can\nbe the secret to having your workforce remember their recognition. A treasure\nhunt is useful in this context, as it combines all the psychological drivers\nof gameplay with real-world, in-office activity.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the retail sector or work in a manufacturing plant \u2013 essentially,\nanywhere with a large office premise \u2013 this could be an excellent idea for\nyou. Confidence Center held a workplace treasure hunt that ended in one\nemployee winning a $100 certificate with a clue released at 7 A.M. each\nmorning. This increased employee morale significantly, all while being a fun\neffort.\n\n### **3\\. Give employees a day off when they least expect it, like Costco**\n\n  \nThe retail sector can be a hard nut to crack when it comes to employee\nappreciation and recognition. Your workforce is putting in long hours, job\nduties can be mundane, and demand peaks several times across the year.\n\nCostco sets an excellent example in appreciating employees \u2013 despite being a\nretail giant, the company shuts shop on Thanksgiving, allowing the workforce\nto spend time with family right in the middle of the holiday shopping season.\nIdeas like this tell employees that you appreciate their efforts and\nprioritize their well-being over and above the business bottom line.\n\n### **4\\. Create a business-specific learning track, like DHL**\n\n  \nIt\u2019s no secret that career development can sometimes be even better than\nemployee benefits. Modern professionals value the opportunity to upskill while\non the job. That\u2019s why Employee Appreciation Day 2020 is a great time to\nannounce a new learning program, designed to improve your company\u2019s\nprofitability while also enhancing employability for the learner.\n\nTake inspiration from [DHL Express\u2019s structured certification\nprogram](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/HRMID-05-2013-0041/full/html)\n(paywall) that invites participation from 360,000 employees across 220\ncountries/territories. Every employee gets a DHL Express \u201cpassport,\u201d earning\nan additional stamp for every course undertaken.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-\nemployee-engagement-ideas/)\n\n### **5\\. Ask your customers to appreciate employee efforts, like Disney**\n\n  \nFor customer-facing roles, positive feedback or a note of appreciation right\nfrom the customer can make employees feel truly valued. In customer feedback\nforms, you can make room to mention specific employees \u2013 these instances can\nbe broadcast across your company later on.\n\nFor example, at Disney Parks & Resorts, guests were often looking to\nappreciate the on-premise workers. Realizing this, Disney launched a\nformalized [#CastCompliment\nprogram](https://www.disneyinstitute.com/blog/creative-employee-recognition-\nmaking-a-big-impact-in/), where guests used this hashtag to tweet their\nappreciation. This was retweeted by the manager, enabling social recognition\nacross the Disney employee community.\n\n### **6\\. Align appreciation with your company values, like Dropbox**\n\n  \nBy aligning your ideas for Employee Appreciation Day with company values, you\ncan reinforce positive workplace behavior and ensure that your cultural stance\nis maintained. You can create appreciation messages for each value and deliver\nit to any employee who does a great job at exemplifying it. This can take\neither a digital or a physical format.\n\nDropbox pioneered this idea with a [dedicated \u201cGratitude Post\u201d\nteam](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/the-case-for-gratitude-at-\nwork), who hand-delivered positive messages to employees who demonstrated\nDropbox\u2019s value at work. The most commonly used value messages also revealed\nkey data into the company\u2019s culture and identified problem areas.\n\n### **7\\. Keep employees in mind when making major workplace decisions, like\nExxonMobil**\n\n  \nOne of the best ways to show employee appreciation is to value every worker\nequally. This is harder than it sounds, especially for large, older companies\nthat have strict hierarchies in place. An office setup that reaffirms these\nhierarchies can make entry and mid-level employees feel less valued and,\nthereby, less motivated.\n\nYou can correct this by making employee-centric workplace decisions. For\ninstance, when ExxonMobil opened its Houston campus in 2015, it followed an\nopen layout, where all workspaces, including board rooms and corner offices,\nwere open to every employee to create a collaborative workplace and eliminate\nhierarchies. ExxonMobil also leveraged soft furniture and chairs scattered\naround the workplace, creating an atmosphere of hygge at work.\n\n### **8\\. Make a big deal of work anniversaries, like Facebook**\n\n  \nWork anniversaries celebrate the loyalty your employee has shown to the\ncompany over the years. It\u2019s advisable to go the extra mile when appreciating\nthis, with more than just a casual email or a gift card.\n\nFacebook makes a big deal of employee work anniversaries (called\nFaceversaries), turning them into birthday-like celebrations. Employees are\nshowered with balloons and a steady flow of social media posts, along with an\ninternal ticker that tracks how much time an employee has spent at the company\ncompared to their peers. For Facebook veterans, this is an essential point of\npride.\n\n### **9\\. Make unlimited PTO a real thing, like GE**\n\n  \nUnlimited paid time off (PTO) doesn't have to be limited to small companies\nand disruptive startups. You can appreciate employees who have shown\nexceptional behavior/contribution with unlimited PTO for a year - announcing\nthis on Employee Appreciation Day is a good idea.\n\nGE has already implemented this across 30,000 of its U.S. employees,\nsignifying a broader cultural shift. Employees only need to take approval from\ntheir manager and ensure all the work is done to avail themselves of this\nbenefit.\n\n### **10\\. Keep up with changing employee sentiment, like Goldman Sachs**\n\nChanging employee sentiment is often a challenge for legacy companies. They\nhold onto existing ways of doing things, unwilling to disturb what\u2019s been the\naccepted practice for years or even decades. As a result, younger/newer\nemployees are left feeling alienated. You can use Employee Appreciation Day to\nannounce progressive changes to company policy, reassuring your workforce that\ntheir voice is heard.\n\nGoldman Sachs recently did this by taking a leaf from Amazon\u2019s playbook,\nreplacing complex presentations with \u201cnarrative memos.\u201d It was a small move,\nbut one that indicates that Goldman Sachs is keeping up with the needs of\nmodern employees.\n\n**11\\. Launch a peer-to-peer learning program, like Google**\n\n  \nThere are several advantages to implementing a peer-to-peer L&D; program. It\nreduces your dependency on third-party providers. Access to learning materials\nis also easier, as employees can simply reach out to their peers. Finally, you\ntell employees that you appreciate their expertise in a subject.\n\nInterestingly, 80% of all formal training at Google happens through their G2G\nor Googler-to-Googler network, reaching 6,000+ employees across the country.\nEmployees with expertise in both hard skills as well as soft skills mentor or\ntrain or design learning programs for other employees. This allows Google to\nleverage in-house expertise and train employees through those closest to the\nbusiness.\n\n### **12\\. Let employees decide how they are assessed, like IBM**\n\n  \nEmpowering your workforce is an excellent way to show that you appreciate\ntheir vantage point. You can conduct company-wide surveys before making a\nchange to workforce management policies. IBM followed this approach when\nselecting how to best review employee performance.\n\nWhen IBM was replacing its ten-year-old performance review system, it asked\nits 380,000 employees precisely what they wanted. Using text analysis on the\ncomments, IBM discovered that a majority of the workforce wasn\u2019t interested in\nself-assessments, among other things. They also found that employees didn\u2019t\nlike the idea of comparative rankings. All of this was factored in when\ndesigning the new review system, IBM\u2019s Checkpoint.\n\n### **13\\. Offer perks employees can\u2019t find anywhere else, like LinkedIn**\n\nWhen it comes to ideas for Employee Appreciation Day, you can\u2019t go wrong with\nout-of-the-box perks. In addition to staples such as health insurance, 401K,\nand stock options, LinkedIn gives its employees massage chairs, a 24/7 gym,\nlectures from reputed guest speakers, and yoga in the afternoons.\n\nYou can tailor these ideas as per the size and nature of your business. For\nexample, if public transport is difficult to come by in your region,\ncommuting/carpool benefits show that you appreciate the myriad facets of an\nemployee\u2019s work life.\n\n### **14\\. Inspire a sense of pride in work, like McDonald\u2019s**\n\n  \nIt isn\u2019t always easy to find meaning in what we do, especially for employees\nworking in process-based industries. This has been a long-standing challenge\nfor McDonald\u2019s, as jobs in the fast-food sector came with a negative\nconnotation.\n\nTo combat this and add value to its employees\u2019 efforts, McDonald\u2019s gave its\nworkforce the chance to work at prestigious events. For example, for the 2012\nOlympics in London, McDonald\u2019s handpicked 2,000 top-performing employees to\nserve customers.\n\nKeep an eye on opportunities like this in your industry, helping employees to\nappreciate better their own efforts in addition to receiving recognition from\nthe company.\n\n### **15\\. Prioritize work-life balance as much as you can, like Microsoft**\n\n  \nWork-life balance is a critical factor that adds value to one\u2019s work \u2013 37% of\nemployees say that good work-life balance is \u201cmost essential.\u201d You can achieve\nthis by designating mandatory work-from-home days, shorter work hours on\nspecific days of the week/month, and flexible timings.\n\nWe\u2019d recommend using Employee Appreciation Day to flag-off experiments on\nwork-life balance, like the one Microsoft recently tried.\n\nFor one month, Microsoft\u2019s Japan offices were closed every Friday, testing the\nimpact of a four-day workweek on employees. This improved productivity by\n39.9% while also reducing resource consumption.\n\n### **16\\. Highlight the contributions of your admin team, like PepsiCo**\n\n  \nTypically, achievements in areas like sales, marketing, and product design are\neasy to recognize and appreciate. It\u2019s the backend executives working on IT,\npayroll, procurement, and a host of other process-based tasks that are left\nout. Take out time on Employee Appreciation Day 2020 to appreciate these\nemployees via public praise.\n\nPepsiCo has made great strides in this sphere, expanding its \u201cRing of Honor\u201d\nprogram beyond the ambit of sales. Now, exceptional performance in operational\nareas like job safety, customer services, and people skills are rewarded by\nelevating employees to the \u201cChairman\u2019s Circle of Champions.\u201d\n\n### **17\\. Distribute recognition badges, like Salesforce**\n\nBadges are a tangible indicator of achievement, letting employees remember and\nshare the fact that they were appreciated. You can hand out physical badges or\ngo the digital route like Salesforce.\n\nSalesforce has designed its very own social collaboration platform called\nChatter, which it uses to share employee appreciation badges in real-time. The\ncompany\u2019s Situation Behavior Impact Model contextualizes the appreciation so\nthat it is widely understood.\n\n### **18\\. Highlight the role played by minorities, like Starbucks**\n\n  \nIt can be difficult for older workers, veterans, and people with disabilities\nto assimilate into the workforce. Employee Appreciation Day becomes even\nharder as they may not always relate to the recognized employee/teams.\n\nStarbucks recently corrected this by opening an entire store operated by\nemployees between the ages of 52 and 66. It has partnered with the National\nInstitute for Elderly People to ensure that this demographic has every\nopportunity to maintain their quality of life. On Employee Appreciation Day\n2020, you can highlight the role played by those demographics who have a\ntougher time in the workplace than others.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is Employee Experience?

Celebrate for one entire week, like The Cheesecake Factory**\n\n  \nTo be very honest, one day isn't nearly enough to showcase the great work done\nby employees across the year. This is precisely why The Cheesecake Factory put\naside a \u201cGreat Place to Work\u201d appreciation week when it formally recognized\nhow its employees made the business so successful.\n\nAfter all, The Cheesecake Factory has regularly been recognized for its\nworkplace initiatives \u2013 a feat that wouldn\u2019t be possible without its\nemployees. Similarly, it\u2019s a good idea to stretch Employee Appreciation Day\n2020 to an entire employee appreciation week or even month, now that you have\nthe time to plan ahead!\n\n### **20\\. Find creative ways to ask for feedback, like Typeform**\n\n  \nAsking for feedback from your employees makes them feel appreciated, but how\ndo you do it in a memorable manner?\n\nTake inspiration from Typeform, a company that plugged a physical typewriter\ninto an iPad in different areas of their office. This would leave employees\nwith emotional satisfaction of having written out a suggestion and submitting\nit while ensuring the company could digitally extract and process the data.\n\n![typeform](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Image source:**[ **Typeform.com**](https://www.typeform.com/blog/inside-\nstory/feedback-culture/)\n\n**Learn More:** **[20 Essential Employee Engagement Survey Questions for Your\n2020 Questionnaire](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-engagement-survey-questions/)** ****\n\n## **Wrapping Up: Making Every Day Employee Appreciation Day**\n\nIt\u2019s great to have one entire day dedicated to making your employees feel good\nabout what they do. It\u2019s even better if they can feel this way all year long.\nTo make appreciation a part of your company\u2019s DNA, you can:\n\n  * Build (or buy) an employee recognition app to simplify the process of appreciation\n  * Have top management embrace a culture of gratitude\n  * Plan employee appreciation keeping in mind the diverse generations that make up your workforce\n  * Review and retire legacy approaches to appreciation\n\nWith these ideas, you\u2019re now equipped to take Employee Appreciation Day 2020\nhead-on. Start planning soon, get feedback from employees, and of course, have\nfun with the numerous ways in which you express your appreciation to your\nemployees!\n\n_Which of these 20 Employee Appreciation Day ideas, caught your eye?

Let\u2019s delve deeper.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n  * **What Is Employee Appreciation and What Are Its Types?**\n  * **Ideas and Strategies to Encourage Employee Appreciation in the Workplace**\n  * **4 Technology Platforms That Enable Appreciation**\n  * **Is Appreciation and Recognition the Same?**  \n\n## What Is Employee Appreciation and What Are Its Types?\n\nEmployee appreciation is the simple act of acknowledging the contributions\nyour employees make to the business and the culture of your workplace. There\u2019s\neven an entire day dedicated to celebrating this \u2013 the first Friday of March\nis designated as **[Employee Appreciation\nDay](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/20-memorable-\nemployee-appreciation-day-ideas-for-2020/)** , but we recommend you make this\na year-long practice.\n\nEmployee appreciation can be classified into six categories, based on three\nparameters:\n\n**Who is appreciating?** | **1\\. Peer-to-peer appreciation** An employee may\nappreciate the work of another team member or a different division. For\nexample, a product manager might thank the marketing team after the successful\nlaunch and promotion of a new offering. | **2\\. Manager appreciation** Manager\nappreciation is typically mandated by company policies, where managers\nappreciate their team members\u2019 efforts. This can also take the form of\norganizational appreciation where senior leaders recognize an achievement.  \n---|---|---  \n**What are they appreciating?** | **3\\. Event-based appreciation** Positive\nfeedback may be triggered by a specific event, such as a work anniversary, the\nmeeting of a professional target, or an exceptional accomplishment at work. |\n**4\\. Regular appreciation** Employees can also be appreciated for simply\ndoing their jobs. This is particularly relevant for support functions such as\nIT, admin, payroll management, etc.  \n**How are they appreciating?** | **5\\. Formal appreciation** This is the most\ncommon type of employee appreciation. Employees are recognized in email\nnewsletters, award ceremonies, or similar formal events. There may also be a\nfinancial component involved in this method.  | **6\\. Informal appreciation**\nInformal appreciation may comprise a quick pat on the back, or a shout-out on\nthe company chat app among other team members. This is essential to keep\nemployees motivated on a day-to-day basis.  \n  \nStudies suggest that many companies have some type of formal recognition\nprogram in place, and a lot of them use a combination of both formal and\ninformal approaches. Here are some [key\nstatistics](https://worldatwork.org/docs/research-and-\nsurveys/Survey+Brief-+Trends+in+Employee+Recognition+2019.pdf) on employee\nrecognition and appreciation:\n\n  * Length of service is the most recognized event at work, with 72% of companies recognizing it. This is followed by exceptional performance (62%) and spot recognitions (55%).\n  * The number of companies formally appreciating their employees is on the rise. In 2005, 19% had a formal program in place \u2013 this increased to 23% in 2019.\n  * 31% of respondents to the survey feel that their recognition programs are only somewhat \u201cmeeting\u201d their goals, with 4% saying that their goals aren\u2019t really met.  \n\nThese trends suggest that while appreciation through recognition is a staple\nin most workplaces, there\u2019s still a long way to go before we achieve a\nholistic culture of well-being, engagement, and motivation. Let\u2019s now look at\nfive strategies that can help you get there.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is an Employee Engagement Survey? Definition, Process,\nVendors, and Examples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-an-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-\nexamples/)**\n\n## Ideas and Strategies to Encourage Employee Appreciation in the Workplace\n\nYou might expect managers and team members to automatically appreciate the\nefforts of their peers and team members. Unfortunately, that isn\u2019t always the\ncase \u2013 companies need to take a proactive stance on employee appreciation,\ninitiating the right strategies to make appreciation a habit and a part of the\ncompany culture. Here are five ways you can start:  \n\n![](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n  \n**Fig 1. Five strategies to implement for employee appreciation**\n\n### **1\\. Adopting gamification to strengthen your motivation and reward\nstructure**  \n\n[Gamification](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/tackling-disengagement-with-workplace-gamification/) brings in\nelements of gameplay to the workplace. This means assigning points to\ndifferent tasks, which are earned upon completion, encouraging healthy\ncompetition with colleagues, defining the rules of the \u201cgame\u201d (or in this\ncase, the job), and finally rewarding the winners \u2013 or the employees who meet\nthese objectives.\n\nGamification lets you embed appreciation into the work structure, taking\nadvantage of employees\u2019 natural desire to do better than their peers.  \n\n### **2\\. Creating an environment where peer-to-peer appreciation is a daily\noccurrence  \n**\n\nPeer-to-peer appreciation strengthens interpersonal relationships in the\nworkplace and ensures that your employees get along with each other. It also\nhighlights that an employee\u2019s peers are paying attention to their work. As a\nresult, employees are likely to perform better, seeking positive feedback not\nonly from the manager but also from their colleagues and team members.\n\nYou can start by having senior leaders call out exceptional achievements among\ntheir ranks and urge younger professionals to do the same.\n\n### **3\\. Acknowledging employees who go out of their way  \n**\n\nAn employee who goes beyond the call of duty to help meet a project deadline\ndefinitely deserves appreciation, followed by recognition and rewards. There\nmust be both formal and informal channels in place to make this happen. For\nexample, you can sponsor a gourmet lunch for employees you ask to come in on\nthe weekends to meet that all-important deadline.\n\nA big project win (or a similar achievement) must be acknowledged by senior\nleadership. Without this, employees will hesitate to go the extra mile at\nwork, and performance is likely to slack.\n\n### **4\\. Providing opportunities for growth  \n**\n\nAn effective way to show that you understand and appreciate an employee\u2019s\ntalent is to give them provisions for career growth. An entry-level hire who\ndoes very well in the first 12 months may deserve to be quickly pushed up the\nladder.\n\nRemember, this employee appreciation strategy requires careful thought and\nassessment. You should be encouraging only those who want to explore growth\nand not impose a change on those already satisfied.  \n\n### **5\\. Making the appreciation of achievements a social activity  \n**\n\nAppreciation in front of a group is more likely to be effective than an\nemployee appreciated in isolation. You can use a social recognition platform[\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-recognition/what-is-\nsocial-recognition/)to applaud employee achievements publicly. These can even\ncome with built-in gift cards, adding a level of financial incentivization to\nthe appreciation system.\n\nNow that you know about the essential strategies needed to encourage\nappreciation in the workplace, take a look at a few ideas for appreciating\nemployees. Remember, employee appreciation doesn\u2019t have to be a cost, effort,\nor investment-heavy process. There are small steps you can take to ensure that\nyour employees feel valued every day. Here are four simple ideas.\n\n### **1\\. Allocate appreciation hours**  \n\nJust like we schedule meetings and breaks, why not set apart a specific time\nfor appreciation as well? For small businesses, this could be as frequent as\nweekly sessions highlighting positive employee behavior. Larger companies can\nbreak this down into a team-wise model.\n\n### **2\\. Set aside space for employee appreciation on your website**\n\nYour careers page is a great place to showcase employee achievements. This has\ntwo benefits. First, employees have a sharable asset that they can show\nfriends and families. Second, it acts as an additional draw for job seekers,\ninspiring them to apply.  \n\n### **3\\. Support employee hobbies**  \n\nYour workforce is good at more than just work \u2013 their passions and hobbies are\nalso a powerful outlet for their talents. Look at how Google lets employees\ndedicate 20% of efforts to side projects \u2013 if this isn\u2019t feasible at your\ncompany, you can start by assigning a \u201chobby day.\u201d  \n\n### **4\\. Espouse a \u201cthank you\u201d culture**  \n\nAt a company where employees are in the habit of showing gratitude for small\ncontributions, employee appreciation will be more forthcoming. Look at email\nsignatures that incorporate a thank you message. This applies to Slack and\nother forms of workplace communication as well.\n\nBy embracing these ideas, you can build a workplace where employees and\nmanagers regularly appreciate each other. Over time, you will see **[employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/)** rising slowly \u2013 and the goodwill encouraged by this\nculture of appreciation will impact customer interactions as well.\n\nAnd, if you want to strengthen the impact of these employee appreciation\nideas, there are several technology platforms you could look at. ****\n\n## 4 Technology Platforms That Enable Appreciation\n\nIt\u2019s a proven fact that happy employees are more productive and cost lesser to\nretain. That\u2019s why this is an area of extreme interest among HR technology\nvendors, eager to ensure employee happiness and well-being. An excellent way\nto make this happen is to use technology for employee appreciation \u2013 here are\nfour examples:\n\n**1.**[ **Guusto**](https://guusto.com/) **\u2013 A digital gift-card platform**  \n  \nGift cards continue to be a popular way of appreciating employees. However, it\ncan be challenging to track who is incurring expenses, what are the popular\nbrands, and if budgetary limits are crossed. Instead of wasting time on manual\nrecords or complex spreadsheets, you can use a platform like Guusto.\nInterestingly, the digitization of rewards also leads to better business\noutcomes.  \nGuusto creates a catalog of digital gift cards that can be redeemed at 50,000+\npartner locations. You can also assign a specific budget to each manager, and\nthey can choose their own rewards combinations. Guusto comes with detailed\nanalytics on expenses, simplifying employee appreciation management. Most\nimportantly, the platform is free of cost, with zero terms or conditions.\n\n**2.**[ **SalesScreen**](https://www.salesscreen.com/) **\u2013 A gamification\nplatform for sales teams**  \n  \nYou can create a setup that contextualizes the daily responsibilities of your\nworkforce. This is particularly true for goal-oriented verticals, such as\nsales teams working towards a target, contact center executives with a\nspecific number of interactions to make, or software developers looking to\ncomplete a sprint.  \nFor the sales function, the SalesScreen platform is a great option.\nSalesScreen creates a leaderboard to track performance and broadcasts customer\nwins onto a television, creating an atmosphere of social appreciation and\nrecognition. There is a built-in rewards shop if you want to incentivize\nachievements.\n\n**3.**[ **Mo**](https://www.mo.work/in-appreciation) **\u2013 A platform for\nappreciation-to-values alignment**  \n  \nThe benefit of going digital is that you can keep track of who is appreciated,\nwhy, and how frequently. This data can be aligned with your company's values,\nmaking sure that you have the right culture in place. Mo enables precisely\nthis with its intuitive recognition tool.  \nMo supports private, manager, and organization-wide appreciation, including\nfinancial rewards for employees who are frequently appreciated. The best part\nis that Mo condenses this data into a culture dashboard, linking every\nappreciation moment to values and behavior.  \n\n**4.**[ **Motivosity**](https://www.motivosity.com/product/) **\u2013 A to address\nthe drivers of motivation**  \n  \nApart from being appreciated, your employees will also want a sense of\ncommunity and regular feedback to keep them motivated. Using a 360-degree tool\nlike Motivosity, you can create a social media-like digital community where\nemployees can see each other\u2019s profiles, appreciate others, share work\nhighlights, and send gifts.  \nJust like social media analytics, Motivosity reveals key stats on appreciation\npatterns in your workplace. This lets you address gaps (for example, an\nemployee who hasn\u2019t been appreciated over a month) before it turns into a\nproblem.\n\nRemember to evaluate the impact of employee appreciation tools and tactics\nusing surveys. Regular anonymized **[surveys to measure employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-an-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-examples/)** can\nhelp to ascertain if your appreciation efforts are having the desired impact.\n\n## Is Appreciation and Recognition the Same?\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that employee appreciation and employee recognition are often\nused interchangeably. For instance, several recognition tools also let you\nappreciate employee efforts \u2013 that\u2019s because there is a definite overlap.\n\nRecognition is the act of rewarding an exceptional achievement at work.\nEmployee appreciation includes this aspect and expands it to cover personal\nqualities like willingness to help others, honesty, flexibility, sense of\nhumor, etc. For progressive companies, recognition is now synonymous with\nappreciation, and the old-school, limited definition of event-based\nprofessional recognition is on its way out.\n\nNow that you know all about what employee appreciation is and its different\ntypes, you can come up with your own ideas for appreciating employees in the\nworkplace. Effective appreciation hinges on in-the-moment, personalized acts.\nThat\u2019s why you need a thoughtful, business-specific strategy before getting\nstarted.\n\n_Do you have any tips for effective employee appreciation?

Seems\nreasonable, right? Your manager assesses your performance annually and\nprovides you formal feedback. Oftentimes, this process includes performance\nfeedback, recognition and some type of performance award (e.g. bonus). The\ncombination of these should result in highly engaged, motivated employees,\nright? Not so fast. Many companies are shifting away from the traditional\nannual boss to subordinate employee evaluation and recognition model and\ninstead embracing more modern approaches. For many organizations incorporating\nand encouraging peer to peer recognition and feedback is becoming an\nincreasingly effective tool in the employee engagement toolbox.\n\nIn collaboration with Workhuman, Society of Human Resources Management\n(SHRM)\u2019s January 2018 report [Using Recognition and Other Workplace Efforts to\nEngage Employees](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-\nforecasting/research-and-surveys/Documents/SHRM-\nGloboforceEmployeeRecognition%202018.pdf) finds the following:\n\n\u00b7      49% of HR professionals believe that performance reviews are _not_ an\naccurate appraisal of employees\u2019 work\n\n\u00b7      Frequent performance reviews are seen as more accurate by HR\n\n\u00b7      76% of HR professionals agree that annual performance reviews are more\naccurate when coupled with ongoing peer feedback\n\n\u00b7      Of the 29% of HR professionals whose organizations use peer feedback,\n89% reported it having a very positive or somewhat positive impact on their\norganization\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\n\u00b7      47% of HR professionals cite retention/turnover as a top workforce\nchallenge\n\n\u00b7      HR professionals are more likely to rate their employee recognition as\n\u201cgood\u201d when any employee is able to nominate or recognize a peer, compared\nwith those who had supervisors/managers, senior-level executives or HR give\nrecognition\n\nAs a corporate consultant I\u2019ve watched many leaders spend a good part of\nDecember and January preparing and delivering obligatory annual reviews, then\ncomplain that it\u2019s an administrative nightmare that usually doesn\u2019t\nsignificantly enhance performance or engagement. Having seen this phenomenon\nunfold year after year, I can\u2019t say that the report findings while alarming\nwere that surprising. In my experience it\u2019s been a bit of a dirty little\nsecret that the old school traditional formal boss/subordinate annual\nappraisal process often doesn\u2019t yield benefits worth the tremendous time\ninvested. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that manager appraisals should be\nabandoned \u2013 they can indeed be a powerful tool when enhanced (e.g. conducted\nmore frequently, peer feedback incorporated, more meaningful feedback\nprovided, etc.).\n\nIndeed, many organizations are realizing that one way to dramatically improve\nemployee engagement is incorporating peer feedback and recognition as part of\ntheir overall performance management process. Intuitively, this makes a lot of\nsense. While the boss/subordinate relationship is undeniably important, bosses\nare rarely uniquely qualified to assess and recognize employee strengths,\naccomplishments and/or developmental areas. After all, most employees spend\nfar less time with their immediate supervisor than they do with their\ncolleagues, peers, customers, suppliers, and other key stakeholders. Virtually\nall organizations laud the fact that most work is accomplished through teams,\nbut more often than not, they typically leave the responsibility for assessing\nor recognizing employee performance or achievement almost exclusively with\nsupervisors and managers as part of \u201ctheir job.\u201d\n\nSome organizations though have challenged traditional processes and started\nincorporating peer feedback as an active part of their employee engagement\nefforts. Duke Energy\u2019s Chief Human Resources Officer Melissa Anderson explains\nthe success of their High Five employee recognition program where peers and\ncolleagues send each other electronic badges with descriptions of why they\u2019re\nbeing recognized. Anderson insists, \u201cEmployees increasingly want more\nfeedback. They want companies to invest in their development, and this peer\nfeedback enriches that process.\u201d\n\n![High Five](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5d5dc6a468cb0a000917c208/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nPeers acknowledge one another using Duke Energy's High Five program\n\nDuke Energy\n\nAnderson also shares that Duke Energy has seen the benefit of encouraging a\n[360 feedback](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-\ntopics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/360-degreefeedback.aspx)\ntype process. \u201cWe have more than 500 leaders that have been through a 360\nreview process that includes peer feedback. We have seen that those who have\nparticipated in the 360 program have a higher rate of creating a development\nplan than those who have not,\u201d says Anderson.\n\nRanked #1 on Fortune\u2019s 2019 List of [The 100 Best Companies to Work\nFor](https://fortune.com/best-companies/), Hilton has implemented peer\nrecognition initiatives including \u201cCatch Me at My Best\u201d and \u201cEmail High\nFives.\u201d Hilton\u2019s Chief Human Resources Officer Matthew Schuyler describes the\npeer recognition programs as \u201ca fast, free and fun way for Hilton Team Members\nto say thank you/congratulations or recognize a colleague or team member.\u201d He\npoints out that content is completely customizable (including language) and\nprint friendly versions are available for those without email access.\n\n![Hilton Catch Me at My Best](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5d5dc73868cb0a000917c215/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nSample Catch Me at My Best Card submission\n\nHilton\n\nWhy do companies invest in peer recognition initiatives? They acknowledge a\nstrong link between vibrant, ongoing peer feedback and recognition and\nenhanced teaming and business results. Gartner\u2019s report [Peer Feedback Boost\u2019s\nEmployee Performance](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/peer-\nfeedback-boosts-employee-performance/) concludes that, \u201cEmployee performance\nimproves when organizations foster a culture of peer feedback and capture how\nemployees add value to others\u2019 work.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, peer recognition isn\u2019t a new concept. I recall decades ago when my\nDirector decided to add \u201cKudos, Tips, and Gripes\u201d as a recurring 5 minute\nagenda item for our team\u2019s weekly staff meetings. The kudos section was\nintended to encourage consistent, regular recognition and positive\nacknowledgment among colleagues. What happened through that process was truly\nprofound. Peers didn\u2019t just share specific kudos that was authentic, timely,\nand sometimes passionate, but they also started to look for opportunities\nduring the work week to catch someone going above and beyond so they could\nshare something special during the staff meeting. Team members receiving the\nfeedback also seemed really moved by it. They definitely appreciated the\nsincere peer feedback more than the typical gift card they might get from\ntheir boss during an employee appreciation event. Indeed, this simple informal\npeer recognition process started to build and strengthen relationships,\nmotivate staff and truly enhance employee engagement.\n\nWhile peer recognition and feedback isn\u2019t a radically new concept, infusing it\ninto the DNA of an organization\u2019s performance management culture arguably is a\nnovel concept for many. It\u2019s one thing to have a peer recognition program \u201con\npaper\u201d that\u2019s rarely used but quite another to radically shift the performance\nmanagement ecosystem to place heavier emphasis on peer feedback and\nrecognition. The suggestion isn\u2019t that bosses don\u2019t matter or traditional\nevaluations don\u2019t have a place in the performance management process \u2013 of\ncourse, they do. But the hard truth is that what is expected rarely motivates.\nWe expect our boss to evaluate us and provide recognition, but when a\ncolleague takes the time to document something specific that we did that made\ntheir life easier, helped a customer or improved a process, we tend to really\nfeel that. We don\u2019t just feel it, we appreciate it, and we feel better about\nwhere we work and who we work with. Some would argue that it\u2019s that feeling\nthat creates and sustains true employee engagement.\n\nFor additional insight on how to enhance employee engagement, check out my\nupcoming article \"How Leading Companies Retain Top Talent and Engage\nEmployees.\"\n\nFollow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danabrownlee).

as some surveys show that about 65% of workers in North America say they\naren\u2019t actively looking for a new job, many of them also report they are not\nengaged at work. But that doesn't mean you can relax with your employee\nretention efforts.\n\nMost of those folks are probably sticking around because they are uncertain\nabout which way the economy is headed.\n\nBut, since they aren\u2019t getting a lot of satisfaction working for you, they are\nopen to other opportunities that might come around.\n\nAt the same time, your company and your competitors are trying to make the\nmost of the current economic upswing while it lasts and are still hunting for\nthe best workers.\n\nThat creates a double-edged employee retention problem for employers.\n\nMany workers you might not miss aren\u2019t feeling very loyal and are sticking\naround just for the paycheck. They\u2019re bored but safe. As soon as things look\npromising, they\u2019ll be back on the job websites.\n\nWorse, while they are at work, they are creating an atmosphere that drags co-\nworkers down into the same \u201cmeh\u201d attitude.\n\nMeanwhile, retaining your top performers remains a challenge as they\u2019re still\nseeing offers interesting enough to make them jump ship.\n\nThe good news is you can attack both problems using the same tool \u2013 an\neffective and sustained employee recognition program.\n\nEven better news? Employers who\u2019ve invested in employee recognition programs\nand technology to support and measure those programs say they can quantify\nlinks between recognition, engagement and employee retention.\n\n## By the numbers\n\nLet\u2019s get the bad news out of the way first.\n\nIn a [survey conducted by leadership training company OGO\nLead](https://hbr.org/2016/05/recognizing-employees-is-the-simplest-way-to-\nimprove-morale), 82% of employed Americans said they didn\u2019t feel their\nsupervisors regularly recognized their contributions.\n\nThat tracks pretty well with findings from recognition platform vendor\nAchievers \u2013 only 9% of the workers they surveyed ranked their managers\n\u201cawesome\u201d at recognizing their contribution.\n\nBut 26% of those same workers ranked recognition in the top three factors for\nstaying in their job and about 20% pointed to a lack of recognition as the\nmain reason they\u2019d consider leaving for a new job.\n\nAnd the folks who are staying put but doing just enough every day? OGO reports\n40% of workers they surveyed said they\u2019d put more energy into work if they\nwere recognized more often.\n\nWhat does that mean in dollars? A [Gallup\nstudy](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/260564/heard-quit-rate-win-war-\ntalent.aspx) put the cost of employee disengagement at work at $960 billion to\n$1.2 trillion in lost productivity a year in the U.S. alone.\n\nThe business analysis and advisory juggernaut has more bad news: Replacing an\nemployee who quits runs from one-half to twice the person's annual salary,\nbringing the cost of \u201cvoluntary turnover\u201d at American companies to $1\ntrillion.\n\nAstounding figures sure to get anyone\u2019s attention. Even so, dollar figures\nthat start with a T are pretty abstract.\n\nYou\u2019ll need more grounded numbers to get leadership\u2019s support to launch and\nsustain an employee recognition program that\u2019ll help stem turnover at your\norganization.\n\n## Critical factors: support from the top and bottom-up recognition\n\nHere\u2019s some information that will help you make your case that recognition is\nkey to employee retention:\n\nA Midwestern grocery chain needed to stem the brutal turnover rates typical of\nthe retail industry. With more than a hundred locations following a series of\nacquisitions, however, it knew that running different programs at each store\nand warehouse was never going to be affordable \u2014 or effective.\n\nTo justify the investment required to build a program, it needed to develop a\ncentralized, standardized program.\n\nThat would help all employees understand that employee recognition was a core\npart of the company\u2019s culture and mission.\n\nThey would all use the same tools to recognize each other and to see how\ncolleagues\u2019 work was helping drive the business.\n\nBy [elevating and praising great\nwork](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/thank-good-people/), the program\nhelped to drive co-workers to emulate their colleagues and strive to be\nrecognized themselves.\n\nThe company appointed corporate and local champions with responsibility for\nmaking it a success.\n\n## Engaging workers and the CFO\n\nAnd that went both ways \u2013 keeping the program fresh and workers engaged and\nsustaining executive buy-in over the long term.\n\nTo keep the investment coming, the employee recognition program had to be\nconnected directly to business goals, results and strategy and be able to\nchange along with them.\n\nThe program champion told an HRMorning webinar audience that, for an employee\nrecognition program to elevate a business in a meaningful way, it must be\ncontinuously tied to the overarching goals of the business.\n\nAnd the champion, usually an HR pro, has to have a seat at the strategy table.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mission critical for the program champion to not only understand the\nentire landscape of the company but to be connected to what's going on,\u201d she\nsaid, \u201cso you're really able to constantly re-evaluate what's relevant to the\nbusiness that recognition could help drive.\u201d\n\nIn addition to giving employees a great way to recognize each other for great\nwork, the retailer solicits feedback from employees and incorporates their\nideas into programs as much as possible.\n\nThe company has also made training on the employee recognition platform a\nrequired part of their[ onboarding\n](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/reinvented-onboarding-program/)process.\n\nAnd it evaluates managers based on the percentage of direct reports who are\nactive on the platform and the percentage who receive recognition over the\ncourse of the year.\n\n## Showing results in engagement and retention\n\nWhen it is time to convince leadership to keep investing in employee\nrecognition, metrics are the key.\n\nFor this retailer, teams receiving more frequent recognition have better\nengagement scores.\n\nTeams with positive engagement scores say they feel more valued through that\nrecognition.\n\nAnd teams who say they feel valued lose fewer workers to voluntary turnover.\n\nHR is able to show that, when recognition goes up in a location, engagement\nscores go up and turnover goes down. Recognition equals retention.\n\nAs a specific example, company metrics show that, at locations where managers\nrecognize 1.8x more than their counterparts, the company sees up to 40% less\nturnover.\n\nAnd by sharing the data across the organization, managers can see how they\nstack up and take steps to increase recognition and improve retention.\n\n\u201cThey can look at all the other data including this recognition data for those\nlocations and recognition tends to be something that they can easily control,\u201d\nthe company champion explained, \u201cThey can easily put a campaign together and\nhelp drive retention at their location. So it's something that they have a lot\nof control over that makes a big impact.\u201d\n\n## Best practices drive best results\n\nThis is just one company\u2019s experience, but it highlights a number of best\npractices for leveraging employee recognition to improve retention:\n\n    1. Tie employee recognition programs to business goals, results and strategy\n    2. Find a champion who can manage the program and keep leadership committed. You can\u2019t launch it and leave it\n    3. Use the employee recognition program to drive desired behavior across the organization \u2013 what\u2019s recognized gets repeated.\n    4. Measure and quantify the return on your employee recognition program investment. Employee recognition drives engagement. Engagement drives performance and retention. And that translates into making and saving real money.\n\n![Tim\nMcElgunn](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Tim\nMcElgunn](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Tim\nMcElgunn](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/newtimart-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Tim McElgunn](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/tmcelgunn/)\n\nTim, a member of the HRMorning staff, is a veteran writer and editor.

Business models will change, the way we work will change, and\ntechnological shifts will transform every facet of how we work. Organizations\nwill have to equip themselves to deal with the rapid rate of change and all\nsorts of crises. And one major factor which will determine who will come on\ntop of all the shifts is leadership. More than ever now, organizations need\nleaders who can be agile, lead the change, and be the answer to everything\nrelated to People and Work. The Covid-19 pandemic has clearly shown us one\nthing-the importance of leaders who can lead through a crisis with a balanced\nhead and balance the talent experience with that of business continuity has\nnever been so much as it is right now.\n\nPeople Matters Are You In The List Awards in association with DDI India aims\nto identify these very emerging HR leaders who can become the answer to the\nchallenges in the people and workspace. The Awards, which is in its ninth year\nof running, has been the beacon helping to identify young emerging HR leaders\nto build the future pipeline of HR leaders.\n\n### 17,500+ applications, over 137 Emerging HR Leaders\n\nIn the last eight years, we have received more than 17,500+ applications, out\nof which more than 137 emerging HR leaders have been recognized until now.\nWhat makes this initiative stand out is the fact that participants have to go\nthrough a 7-stage rigorous process that separates the wheat from the chaff.\nStarting from the online application to online assessments to business case\nstudy method to cognitive ability testing to being evaluated by a jury on the\nskills required to be a successful HR Leader in the final stages, candidates\nare screened extensively to determine if they have the required competencies\nto be that trailblazing leader. This year will also see a virtual face-off\nwith the jury which will lead to the identification of the Emerging Future HR\nLeaders.\n\nThis rigorous process of selection has ensured that the awards spot those\ncourageous HR professionals who are anticipators of workforce and talent\ntrends relevant to the business. But this legacy just does not end at spotting\nthese future leaders. The fact that many of these HR professionals have now\nmade their way to the top rung of management as HR Heads/Function Heads is a\ntestimony to the fact that the awards are not just merely corporate awards but\nrecognition par excellence.\n\nPeople Matters has been presenting these most awaited awards every year since\n2012. The award journey was conceptualized in 2012 in collaboration with\nDevelopment Dimensions International ([DDI](https://www.ddiworld.com/)) which\nis the Presenting Partner for this year as well. Meanwhile, [Harappa\nEducation](https://harappa.education/) is the Behavioural Learning Partner for\nthis year.\n\nLast year, in August, the 8th Edition of People Matters Are You In The List\n2018 saw 17 finalists being crowned as the future 'Emerging HR Leaders'.\n\n![RUIL](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1585815512/ruilawards_joykp5.jpg)\n\nThis year too, the awards will endeavor to identify a handful of such talent\npowerhouses who have it in them to successfully chart the course of future for\ntheir organizations. The jury for this year consists of eminent leaders such\nas Dr. Santrupt Misra, CEO, Birla Carbon; Director, Chemicals; and Director,\nGroup Human Resources for the Aditya Birla Group, Amar Nagaram, CEO, Myntra &\nJabong, Alok Ohrie, President & MD, Dell Technologies, India, Rohit Kapoor,\nCEO - India & South Asia, OYO, Kamal Bali, President and MD, Volvo Group\nIndia, and Venkataraman S. V., Managing Director, ANZ, among others.\n\nDo you think you are one of those torch bearers who can go through the grind\nand emerge victorious as the leader of tomorrow? Do you think you are the\nanswer to this quest of a future leader who can lead the change in 2020 and\nbeyond?\n\nThen here\u2019s your chance to make it to the coveted list of People Matters Are\nYou In The List Awards 2020.

This day is often seen as\nemployer branding gold\u2014an opportunity to showcase a company\u2019s culture. Post\nsome photos from the party you threw for employees. Show how fun it is to work\nat your company.\n\nSure, parties are nice. But just like seeing your neighbors once a year at the\nannual Memorial Day barbecue does little to build a lasting relationship,\nneither does _solely_ throwing a party on March 6 strengthen the bond between\nemployers and employees.\n\n## Going beyond Employee Appreciation Day\n\nI\u2019d love to see more companies go beyond surface-level appreciation. To really\nembrace the concept of thanking employees for their hard work and effort\nthroughout the year, appreciation is a mindset HR and people managers need to\nembrace all the time. It\u2019s a whole new management strategy, based on\ngratitude, fit for the workplace of the future.\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\nAfter all, a service anniversary plaque every five years or an annual Employee\nAppreciation Day bash may have been enough for previous generations. Not\nanymore. Unemployment numbers in the United States are still at an all-time\nlow, and recent research from Workhuman indicates at least one in five full-\ntime workers is actively looking for a new job. That doesn\u2019t include those who\nwould passively entertain a call from a recruiter.\n\nSo what does it take to build a culture of recognition? It\u2019s about taking a\nmoment as an individual to drop the mask of formality that so many of us put\non at work and simply note when another person has done their job well. That\ncreates a positive relationship between individuals.\n\nWhen companies invest in a social recognition program that allows employees to\nshare their gratitude in the moment, up and down the organization, this\ncollectively creates a culture of positivity. Companies that invest just 1% of\npayroll into such a program see significant returns in not just retention, but\nalso productivity. Workhuman customers show an average increase in employee\nproductivity of $1,737 per employee. For a 15,000-person organization, this\nequals an annual benefit of $26 million compared to industry peers.\n\nFrom this increase in frequency and volume of appreciation comes a host of\nother benefits as well. Our own research has shown workers recognized in the\nlast month are more than twice as likely to see a path to grow in the\norganization and nearly twice as likely to trust their HR team. What\u2019s more,\nmuch of the same benefits result from giving recognition. In particular, those\nwho\u2019ve had the opportunity to give recognition in the last month are more than\n2x as likely to be highly engaged compared to those who\u2019ve never recognized a\ncolleague.\n\n## The heart of employee experience\n\nNot long ago, Workhuman asked employees across industries, \u201cWhat is the one\nthing you would change about your organization\u2019s culture?\u201d The top response\nwas that people want to foster a culture of appreciation \u2013 in short, mutual\nrespect among the people of a company, from top to bottom.\n\nReally think about this: Does your annual bash show people you appreciate them\nfor who they are and what they do? Does it reinforce mutual respect? Despite\nthe flashy employer brand posts that will pop up on LinkedIn Friday, an\nalarming number of people are still feeling a lack of appreciation and respect\nin the workplace. The same Workhuman survey previously mentioned found 22% of\nworkers have either never been recognized at work or haven\u2019t been recognized\nin more than two years. And even as companies ramp up diversity and inclusion\npractices, we found 25% of workers have been discriminated against at work and\n31% have witnessed a colleague being discriminated against.\n\nTo build up trust and respect and fundamentally change employee experience, we\nneed to understand work is a relationship, not a contract. As such, the\nprograms and practices that make the most impact focus less on a one-time,\nsuperficial show of support, and more on recognizing and appreciating the\nwhole human continuously throughout the year.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on in your employees\u2019 lives outside of work? Who just bought a\nhouse or became a first-time parent? Who just ran their first marathon or\ncompleted a degree? There\u2019s a [growing trend](https://hbr.org/2019/12/what-\nthe-best-companies-to-work-for-do-differently \"https://hbr.org/2019/12/what-\nthe-best-companies-to-work-for-do-differently\") among forward-thinking\ncompanies that we need to look beyond job satisfaction and acknowledge\nemployees\u2019 life satisfaction. The two cannot be separated.\n\nBy appreciating employees not only for what they do in their day-to-day job,\nbut also for who they are as people, you\u2019ll see huge dividends when it comes\nto feelings of belonging, connection, and trust in the workplace. This is the\nnext evolution of appreciation, and it goes much deeper than a party sponsored\nby HR.\n\nFollow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmosleyceo/).

bounded onto the compensation scene, and it\u2019s not going\nanywhere soon\u2014other than up.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | March 16,

employer that allowed its workforce see\neveryone else\u2019s pay, whether partially or in full, was about as popular as a\n50% turnover rate.\n\nHow times have changed. Pay transparency has bounded onto the compensation\nscene, and it\u2019s not going anywhere soon\u2014other than up.\n\nA survey from WorldatWork, with underwriting support from Mercer, in fact,\nfound that 67% of organizations report pay transparency is increasing in\nimportance at their organizations, with 4% rating pay transparency as having\nthe \u201chighest\u201d importance.\n\nThat\u2019s the positive news. The flip side is the _[Pay Transparency\nStudy](https://www.worldatwork.org/Survey%20Brief%20-%20Pay%20Transparency%20Survey%20-%20Jan.%202020.pdf)\n_reports that only 14% of organizations have approached pay transparency\nbeyond a \u201cmoderate\u201d level. Why the discrepancy? Some experts believe it may be\nbecause moving to pay transparency is, in part, both misunderstood and\ncomplicated. In any form, it might seem downright scary to seriously move into\npay-transparency mode.\n\nOther key survey findings include:\n\n  * More than 60% of organizations say managers are not trained to effectively deliver pay communications;\n  * 42% of employers do not share information about how jobs are valued and compensated within the organization;\n  * when pay equity adjustments are made, 53% of organizations explicitly communicate to the employees that the increase is the result of a pay-equity adjustment; 30% bundle it with other pay increases without explicit communication on the adjustment; and\n  * compliance runs the gamut: 22% of organizations are not subject to pay-transparency regulations, 32% are subject to minimal laws that affect practices, 38% have few laws to comply with but they\u2019re manageable, and 9% are subject to several laws that they say are difficult to manage.\n\n**Related:[DOL issues new proposed pay-transparency\nrule](https://hrexecutive.com/dol-issues-new-proposed-price-transparency-\nrule/)**\n\nFor purposes of the survey, WorldatWork, the professional nonprofit\nassociation focused on total rewards, defined pay transparency as the degree\nto which employers are open about what, why, how and _how much_ employees are\ncompensated, and to which they allow employees to share pay\u2010related\ninformation with others. This can extend beyond base pay to include variable\npay and other rewards components, as well as other facets and/or means to\nrewards, such as promotions, recognition, development and performance\nassessment, according to WaW.\n\n\u201cAs organizations address potential areas of unintended bias with pay systems,\nit\u2019s reassuring to see that pay transparency is becoming more of a priority,\u201d\nsays Scott Cawood, president and CEO of WorldatWork. \u201cWorkplace equity is a\ncomplex issue, with pay transparency just one facet. This survey, along with\nother recent research, illuminates how critical it is for compensation and HR\nprofessionals to stay current on the evolving conversation in order to\neffectively build strategies that foster workplace equity at their\norganizations.\u201d\n\nCawood says the greatest survey surprises were how few organizations have\ndealt with pay transparency beyond a moderate level, and how many managers are\nnot trained to deliver pay communications. He also called response variance\n\u201cinteresting,\u201d noting that organizations range along a continuum in how they\nrate their overall state of pay transparency with employees.\n\n\u201cCompliance runs the gamut as far as the degree to which organizations are\nsubject to pay-transparency regulations,\u201d he says, adding that there is an\nalmost even split between organizations reporting compliance driving their pay\ntransparency efforts versus other factors.\n\n\u201cThe survey results certainly reveal the vast landscape of where organizations\nare regarding pay transparency-related policies and practices,\u201d he says.\n\nTheresa Sieg, director of compensation at Wisconsin-based Froedtert Health\u2014a\nteaching hospital and a Level I adult trauma center (and WorldatWork member\ncompany)\u2014says Froedtert has been on a gradual pay-transparency journey for the\npast three years and counting.\n\n\u201cCurrently, we have a compensation philosophy regarding how jobs are evaluated\nin the market and placed into grades, and how individual pay is determined\nwithin the grades,\u201d she explains. Sieg says leaders are informed regarding the\nmarket data and grade placement for jobs, and staff are made aware of how\ntheir pay placement within a pay range is determined.\n\n\u201cWe also share pay ranges for jobs with staff and candidates,\u201d she says.\n\n**See also:[John Sumser: Driving pay transparency with intelligent\ntools](https://hrexecutive.com/john-sumser-how-to-drive-salary-transparency-\nwith-intelligent-tools/)**\n\nSieg says that, historically, there was a belief among staff and leaders that,\nbecause the compensation group wasn\u2019t always transparent about market data,\ngrade assignment or pay-range placement, it meant people were being\nshortchanged somehow. This led to employees believing their pay was not\ncompetitive, she adds, which frequently wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nIt only made sense, Sieg says, that, with all of the resources Froedtert\nHealth was investing into being \u201cfully committed\u201d to competitive pay, it would\nalso be open and honest about how pay is determined, educating leaders and\nstaff so they can become more knowledgeable and confident their pay is\nappropriate and competitive.\n\n\u201cSince [enhancing] transparency, we have seen reductions in turnover,\nparticularly first-year turnover, in areas where market and equity reviews\nhave been completed using our more transparent approaches,\u201d she notes.\n\nMost of all, Sieg says, it\u2019s critical to have \u201ctop-down\u201d support for such\ninitiatives. Froedtert Health was fortunate that executive leadership\nrecognized the importance of a more defined, transparent approach and have\nbeen very supportive of its rollout, she adds.\n\n\u201cWe realize it\u2019s a journey of continuous education and improvement\u2014we\u2019ve come\na long way and made great strides, but we\u2019re nowhere near done,\u201d Sieg says,\nadding that many opportunities still exist for fine-tuning the strategy. \u201cThe\nprocess of evolving towards transparency takes time, especially since it can\nbe a large cultural adjustment.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tauseef Rahman, principal at Mercer, pay transparency, along with\npay equity and pay strategy, can play an important role in delivering an\nauthentic employee experience, which directly impacts employee engagement.\n\n\u201cAs organizations strive to balance business demands with changing workforce\nexpectations around pay, it poses challenges as well as opportunities for both\nemployers and employees to thrive in today\u2019s economy,\u201d he says.\n\nCompanies are likely dealing with the fact that there is \u201ccleanup\u201d that needs\nto be done to move towards greater transparency, he says, and that is likely\ncausing the gap between intention and action. Rahman notes that the time\nbetween intention and action will run out for employers, given the\nexpectations of employees and of society.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, pay data is no longer something that the compensation\nfunction within the company owns or controls,\u201d Rahman says.\n\nAnna Krasniewska, vice president of advisory at Gartner, says her firm\nbelieves pay transparency is an issue that total-rewards executives and\nemployees alike have seen grow in importance over the last three years and\nwill continue to do so.\n\n\u201cNearly all organizations feel that there are employee outcomes to be\ngained\u2014such as engagement, fairness, differentiation and manager quality\u2014but\nmost organizations struggle [with] where to begin, and they worry about\nemployee reactions to transparency, which slows their ability to get started,\u201d\nshe explains.\n\nEmployers on the fence are most certainly not alone, she says, noting that\norganizations often want pay systems and allocations to be perfect before\nstarting on pay-transparency initiatives, for fear of what employee reactions\nmight be.\n\n\u201cThis is true for about 90% of organizations,\u201d Krasniewska says.\n\n\u201cEmployees already think pay situations are bad,\u201d she adds. \u201cIn fact,\nemployees perceive equity and fairness situations much worse than they are.\u201d\nKrasniewska recommends a carefully considered transparency strategy, which\ngive organizations the best path to inform and educate employees about pay and\npay process, building confidence in the pay system.\n\n\u201cWe often work with organizations on a roadmap to get started on pay\ntransparency, so that organizations can keep moving forward on transparency\nregardless of starting point,\u201d she says.\n\nRegardless of where they launch, Krasniewska says, all organizations can make\nstrides in pay transparency. She explains that when employers pursue the three\nmost impactful areas of pay transparency\u2014how to influence pay through\nperformance; how payouts are determined; and how an organization considers\ninternal and external equity\u2014they can increase employee confidence by up to\n15%. That, in turn, is correlated to engagement, performance and retention.\nShe notes that the biggest mistake Gartner sees organizations make is waiting\ntoo long to start on pay transparency.\n\n\u201cOrganizations need to remember that, just because they themselves are not\ncommunicating to their employees about pay doesn\u2019t mean that no one is\ncommunicating to employees about pay\u2014there are always external sources filling\nthe void,\u201d she says, noting that those sources don\u2019t spend nearly as much time\nconfirming that their information is correct, which only increases the work\norganizations will have to do in the long run to build employee confidence.\n\nGartner finds that that transparency actually serves three major needs for\nemployees:\n\n  * Basic understanding: This is the notion that, if organizations share more about pay, employees will better understand pay itself and how to interpret the onslaught of outside data and sources about pay.\n  * A notion of fairness in employees: Organizations will need employees to move beyond knowing their pay amount to understanding the practice around pay, and a belief that these practices and allocations are fundamentally fair at their organizations.\n  * Build\u2014but also regain\u2014trust in the organization: With so many external factors\u2014whether it\u2019s outside sources or screaming headlines\u2014most companies want their employees to rebuild institutional trust in the organization, especially when it comes to pay.\n\n\u201cWhen organizations design and implement their pay-transparency strategies\naround those three needs, they see significant gains in employee performance,\nretention and confidence in the organization,\u201d Krasniewska says.\n\nMercer\u2019s Rahman expects employee expectations for pay transparency to continue\nto grow in the years ahead, and that employers\u2019 transparency will follow\nsuit\u2014both to meet employee demands and to address the public information about\nwhat and how companies pay.\n\nTo Rahman, the reality is that how and what a company pays is already in the\npublic domain.\n\n\u201cArguing whether self-reported data are accurate or not misses the point that\npeople\u2014and not the company\u2014are telling the story of pay,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, why\nwouldn\u2019t a company want to take point a view on what their story actually is?\u201d\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

Many become just another box for managers to\ncheck or are seen as elite opportunities for a favored few, leaving the rest\nof the workforce feeling left out. Meanwhile, a lot of individual managers\nalso fail to adequately express appreciation, mistakenly assuming that reports\nknow how they feel or struggling to balance gratitude with developmental\nfeedback. In focus groups and interviews, however, employees reveal that\nmaking them feel valued and recognized isn't all that complicated: It mostly\ncomes down to a lot of small, commonsense practices.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/01/Jan20_23_200380734-00.jpg)\nFreudenthal Verhagen/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/01/the-little-things-that-make-employees-feel-\nappreciated?language=es)\n\nImagine this scenario: An employee named Rowen arrives at work on his 10-year\nanniversary and finds a gift card with a sticky note on his desk. The note is\nfrom his manager, acknowledging his anniversary. Realizing it didn\u2019t even\ninclude a thank-you or a congratulations, Rowen rolls his eyes.\n\nWhile most companies run employee-recognition programs of some sort, all too\noften they produce reactions like Rowen\u2019s. Instead of giving people a\nmeaningful sense of appreciation, they become just another box for managers to\ncheck and are completely disconnected from employees\u2019 accomplishments. Some\ncompanies try to make programs more relevant by giving specific awards to\nindividuals who\u2019ve, say, created and led an important new initiative,\n\u201cembodied\u201d the organization\u2019s values in their behavior, or had a significant\nimpact. Yet that approach has problems too: Awards can be seen as an elite\nopportunity for a chosen few \u2014 and leave the majority of the workforce feeling\nleft out and overlooked.\n\nIf managers could make a far broader group of employees feel appreciated, the\nbenefits would be considerable. Adam Grant and Francesca Gino [have\nfound](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-09990-007) that when people\nexperience gratitude from their manager, they\u2019re more productive. Another\n[researcher](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0021886318773459?casa_token=3Ce_d55IgUMAAAAA%3ADeRRVI1M0bhud3xohV_4hU67k5fA2zdFY_Oa3EM5aJ-\nJN3VY9OtdcciV9vY3aaeOLB417oyKJxDn4A) recently found that teams perform tasks\nbetter when their members believe that their colleagues respect and appreciate\nthem.\n\nBut in our combined 50-plus years of working to improve organizations, we\u2019ve\nobserved that many managers struggle to make employees feel that their talents\nand contributions are noticed and valued. To explore this problem, we recently\ntook a deep dive within an organization to see how organizational efforts to\nshow appreciation and gratitude were perceived. In that project we engaged\nwith both employees and managers through focus groups, survey questions, and\nlearning sessions. And what we discovered was that even though bosses feel\nit\u2019s challenging to show their staff appreciation, the _employees_ think it\u2019s\nactually pretty simple.\n\n### **The Gap Between Managers and Employees**\n\nOur discussions surfaced notable gaps between managers\u2019 and employees\u2019\nperceptions. First, there was a stark difference between how much managers\nappreciated employees and how appreciated employees felt. We speculate that\n[the _illusion_ _of_\n_transparency_](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1998-10511-003), or people\u2019s\ntendency to overestimate how visible their emotions are to others, explains\nthis: Managers incorrectly assumed employees _knew_ how they felt about them.\n\nSecond, many managers reported that communicating appreciation seemed really\ncomplicated. Some had trouble balancing it with developmental feedback and\nfeared sending mixed messages to employees. Some were concerned that their\nefforts to offer appreciation to all employees would be routinized and seen as\nimpersonal and meaningless. Employees, on the other hand, did not see this as\na complex task and quickly and clearly articulated the precise ways managers\ncould effectively express appreciation. Here\u2019s what they told us managers\nneeded to do:\n\n**1.** **Touch base early and often.** While regularly taking time to say\nhello to employees and check in with them might seem like an unnecessary drain\non your productivity, these interactions are actually valuable points of\nconnection for your employees (and for you). They prevent your staff from\nfeeling invisible. One of the employees in our focus groups told us that\nsimply hearing \u201cGood morning\u201d or \u201cHow are you?\u201d from his department manager\nwould have been as meaningful as formal recognition. If you create routines\nthat allow your employees to share stories with you about what they\u2019re doing\nor working on, you can make them feel \u201cknown\u201d by you \u2014 and stay in the loop on\nwhat\u2019s happening within your organization.\n\n**2.** **Give balanced feedback**. Employees want to know both what they\u2019re\ndoing well and where they can improve. In our discussions they reported time\nand again that receiving feedback \u2014 positive and developmental \u2014 was one of\nthe key things that made them feel valued. As one employee explained,\nreceiving praise from her manager was meaningful, but because she never got\nimprovement-oriented suggestions, she questioned how valid the positive\nfeedback was. Meanwhile, some employees who received only critical feedback\nseemed to give up, because they felt they could never do anything right.\n\nThe trick is to avoid giving both types of feedback at once. When managers try\nthe common [sandwich technique](/2013/04/the-sandwich-approach-undermin),\nstuffing negative feedback between two layers of positive feedback, employees\njust get confused. In our experience, the people who needed the developmental\nfeedback most tended to only hear the positive things their manager said, and\nthe people who performed well left remembering more of the negative comments.\nSo be sure to clearly [separate out the positive feedback from the\ndevelopmental feedback](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stop-serving-feedback-\nsandwich-adam-grant/).\n\n**3\\. Address growth opportunities.** Employees want to know what the future\nholds for their careers. When managers take time to explicitly discuss growth\npotential or provide opportunities and \u201cstretch\u201d assignments, employees\ninterpret it as evidence that they\u2019re valued. Conversely, when managers\nneglect to address people\u2019s development, employees take it as a sign that they\nare _not._ One employee told us, \u201cMy manager is constantly recognizing my\nwork, and I know that she sees that I go over and above. The issue is that she\ndoesn\u2019t fight to get me new and greater opportunities.\u201d\n\n**4\\. Offer flexibility.** Whether managers gave people the option to work\nremotely or even simply suggested someone come in late the day after working\nextra hours, employees were quick to interpret it as an important signal of\ntrust and appreciation. One employee told us that he felt the flexible work\nschedule his manager offered him was \u201ca huge recognition.\u201d\n\n**5\\. Make it a habit.** Simply taking a few minutes to tell your employee\nspecifically what you value about their contributions can have a tremendous\nimpact. Try to build it into your regular routines, perhaps by spending the\nfirst 15 minutes of your week [writing a personal thank-you\nnote](/2020/01/great-leaders-understand-why-small-gestures-\nmatter?referral=03759&cm_vc=rr_item_page.bottom) or starting your team\nmeetings with shout-outs briefly acknowledging accomplishments of individual\nteam members. The range of options are almost limitless. Some managers we\nspoke to gave food and gift cards as tangible expressions of their\nappreciation; others made it a point to visit with each of their reports\ndaily. The idea isn\u2019t to create an automatic system for thanking employees,\nhowever; it\u2019s more about giving yourself permission to express your\nappreciation in a way that feels natural to you.\n\n### ** ** **Mistakes to Avoid**\n\nEmployees were equally clear about the ways in which managers communicated a\n_lack_ of appreciation for them. Here are some common things managers get\nwrong:\n\n**1.  ** **Expressions of gratitude that are inauthentic or sweeping\ngeneralizations.** Appreciation needs to be specific and genuine. While\nemployees were enthusiastic about the variety of ways in which gratitude can\nbe expressed, they were not moved by empty or offhanded gestures. There\u2019s a\nbig difference between yelling a thank-you on your way out the door versus\nsitting down with someone to describe the things you value about their work\nand its positive effect on the team or organization.\n\nMeaningful expressions of appreciation were often described as timely,\nrelevant, and sincere, and expressions that come off as hollow may actually be\nworse than no thanks at all. Managers also need to tread carefully when\nrecognizing everyone on a team. Sometimes a group\u2019s performance is not a\nreflection of equal contributions from all its members, and you run the risk\nof alienating high performers if everyone receives the same recognition.\n\n**2.** **Neglecting standard company procedures.** Many busy managers feel\nthat procedures like annual reviews, quarterly check-ins, and nominating\nemployees for awards are a waste of time. But to employees, they\u2019re important\nmilestones that provide clues about their progress and performance. When a\nmanager skips them, employees often infer that they, not the procedure, are\nwhat the manager doesn\u2019t value. If you\u2019re going to deviate from the\norganization\u2019s rulebook, at the very least you need to be explicit with your\nemployees about why, or they might conclude that your inaction is a statement\nabout them.\n\n**3.** **Letting employees feel isolated from coworkers or the larger\norganization.** For managers, it\u2019s much easier to see how the contributions of\neach person fit with the work of others, but employees often lack that\ninsight. When managers highlight how employees use one another\u2019s work within\ntheir department or across others, it sets the stage for appreciation to\nspread throughout the organization.\n\n**4\\. Sudden or unexplained shifts in your appreciation practices.** If you\nhaven\u2019t been focused on showing your employees appreciation, don\u2019t\novercompensate for it; chances are, they\u2019ll see your efforts as insincere.\nInstead, let them know that you\u2019re working on developing your gratitude skills\nas a leader. Take time to ask how they\u2019d like to be recognized. Some may enjoy\nbeing thanked publicly, while others will bristle at the idea. The key is to\nknow your employees\u2019 individual preferences.\n\n### **Making Appreciation Easy and Contagious**\n\nThe best part of appreciation is that it\u2019s free and doesn\u2019t consume a lot of\ntime. Anyone at any level can offer appreciation. It can be directed toward an\nemployee, a colleague, or a boss. But when leaders get involved in the effort,\na culture of appreciation spreads more quickly.\n\nOne thing that helps is getting together with other managers to discuss\ngratitude strategies that have worked well (or haven\u2019t). If you\u2019re a manager,\nconsider partnering with one or more peers to exchange ideas and create\naccountability for your efforts.\n\nAt the end of the day, building a culture of appreciation comes down mostly to\na lot of small commonsense practices: Not taking your people for granted.\nRemembering to say thank-you in a personal and sincere way. Making it clear\nthat you\u2019re interested in your employees\u2019 growth and in them as individuals.\n\nStart by expressing more gratitude to those around you and see what happens.\nYou might be surprised at what a big difference the little things can make.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/05/Gibson1-headshot.jpg)\n\n[Kerry Roberts\nGibson](/search?term=kerry%20roberts%20gibson&search_type=search-all) is an\nassistant professor in the Management Division at Babson College.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/01/110-Kate-OLeary.jpg)\n\nKate O'Leary is the director of compensation, rewards, and client engagement\nin the Office of Human Resources at Babson College.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/01/110-Joe-Weintraub.jpg)\n\n[Joseph R.

Reward & recognition\n\n# Driving employee engagement through recognition\n\nIf you're not leading from the top, it may be causing you more internal issues\nthan you realise\n\n![Driving employee engagement through recognition](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637175481395982985.jpg)\n\nBY HRD  18 Feb 2020\n\nShare\n\nThere's a tendency for business owners to see financial remuneration as the\nbe-all and end-all of employee recognition. Why, they ask, is additional\nrecognition for employees necessary when they're already being paid for\nturning up to work? Surely that's enough, right?\n\nAbsolutely not, says Matt Seadon, General Manager APAC at Achievers.  As a\nspecialist in social-based recognition, he's well aware of the challenges that\nHR can encounter from senior management when they attempt to introduce\nrecognition programs into the office.\n\n\"One of the important things that we explain to business owners is that\nrecognition programs are happening in any office, whether or not they've been\nofficially endorsed by management,\" explains Seadon. \"The problem there is\nthat there's very little top-down visibility. Applications can be wildly\ninconsistent from department to department, and even down to employee to\nemployee.\"\n\nOn paper, that might not sound too serious, but Seadon cautions that it can\nquickly lead to inequality and resentment between employees - all of which can\nspill over and cause wider workplace issues. Performance, revenue, retention,\nand wider workplace culture can all be negatively impacted.\n\nRather, Seadon notes, companies must look for consistent and values-based\nmeans to ensure that employee recognition is both regular and effective.\nSocial recognition programs enable teams to take ownership and take action\naround recognition. Senior management must actively drive the program, and\nmodel the behaviours they want to encourage within the workplace.\n\n\"When we talk about recognition, in the social sense, we're talking about\ngiving people tools to identify moments when they can recognise others,\"\nSeadon explains. \"It leads to better communication among management and co-\nworkers, as well as providing positive reinforcement for great work.\"\n\nSeadon believes there are wider workplace culture benefits too - something\nwhich can't be underestimated in the current working world.\n\n\"It's been interesting to watch over the last few years how organisations'\ncultures have become much more visible,\" says Seadon.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/038/0223_637215290728643929.jpg)](/nz/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/flexible-work-from-the-new-normal-to-the-new-necessary/218904)\n\n#### [Flexible Work: from the new normal to the new\nnecessary](/nz/specialisation/employee-engagement/flexible-work-from-the-new-\nnormal-to-the-new-necessary/218904)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/038/0248_637217770659097647.jpg)](/nz/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/its-never-been-more-important-to-listen-to-employees/219018)\n\n#### ['It's never been more important to listen to\nemployees'](/nz/specialisation/employee-engagement/its-never-been-more-\nimportant-to-listen-to-employees/219018)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637213360039891507.jpg)](/nz/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218601)\n\n#### [COVID-19: HR's main challenges revealed](/nz/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218601)\n\n\"Tools like social media and employer review websites have meant that\noutsiders can have a much clearer view of what might have traditionally gone\non behind closed doors. It definitely has an influence on an organisation's\nreputation, which can help or harm future recruitment too.\"  \n\nIn terms of recognition frequency, Seadon believes that employers should be\nrecognising employees \"as often as possible\".\n\n\"We do look at more specific metrics, of course,\" laughs Seadon. \"One\nrecognition per person per month is the baseline, but more is obviously\nbetter. Any good program should also allow managers and employees alike to be\nprompted when they haven't recognised anyone in a while, too, as well as\nspotting whether specific staff have been particularly singled out for\nrecognition.\"\n\nSeadon notes that Achievers also work closely with clients to look at ways\nthey can remove potential barriers to providing recognition. Recognition,\nSeadon believes, isn't something that should be too complicated for people to\ngive.\n\n\"That's one of the shortcomings that we've seen with other formal or informal\nrecognition programs,\" says Seadon. \"If you see a co-worker demonstrate great\nbehaviour, it shouldn't be a complicated process to enact that recognition.\nIt's something that people should be easily able to do from any system they\nare in or in their daily flow of work.\"\n\nUltimately, Seadon is of the opinion that there is a correlation between\nrecognition behaviour and peak performance - tools for recognition are a means\nto facilitate that.\n\n\"HR needs to aid in the process of normalising the practice of recognition\nacross all employees,\" says Seadon. \"If we're aiding employees in feeling\nbetter appreciated in the workplace, we're feeding back into better working\nenvironments and better performance in the process.\"\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily newsletters\nfrom HRD New Zealand.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n### Recent articles & video\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/038/0223_637218766796648305.jpg)](/nz/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/can-workers-in-essential-services-refuse-to-work-due-to-covid-19/219172)\n\n#### [Can workers in essential services refuse to work due to\nCOVID-19?](/nz/specialisation/employment-law/can-workers-in-essential-\nservices-refuse-to-work-due-to-covid-19/219172)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218756963772601.jpg)](/nz/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219165)\n\n#### [How has COVID-19 impacted managers and employees?](/nz/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219165)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218753186012580.jpg)](/nz/news/general/ceo-\nof-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-from-a-challenge/219159)\n\n#### [CEO of HP Canada: 'I was never one to shy away from a\nchallenge'](/nz/news/general/ceo-of-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-\nfrom-a-challenge/219159)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/038/0248_637217770659097647.jpg)](/nz/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/its-never-been-more-important-to-listen-to-employees/219018)\n\n#### ['It's never been more important to listen to\nemployees'](/nz/specialisation/employee-engagement/its-never-been-more-\nimportant-to-listen-to-employees/219018)\n\n### Most Read Articles\n\n#### [Flexible Work: from the new normal to the new\nnecessary](/nz/specialisation/employee-engagement/flexible-work-from-the-new-\nnormal-to-the-new-necessary/218904)\n\n04 Apr 2020\n\n#### ['It's never been more important to listen to\nemployees'](/nz/specialisation/employee-engagement/its-never-been-more-\nimportant-to-listen-to-employees/219018)\n\n07 Apr 2020\n\n#### [COVID-19: HR's main challenges revealed](/nz/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218601)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n__\n\n  * [HRT](https://www.hrtechnologynews.com/)\n  * [Companies](/nz/companies)\n  * [People](/nz/people)\n  * [Newsletter](/nz/newsletter)\n\n  * [About us](/nz/about-us)\n  * [Authors](/nz/authors)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/nz/privacy-policy)\n  * [Conditions of use](/nz/conditions-of-use)\n  * [Contact us](/nz/contact-us)\n  * [RSS __](/nz/rss)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/HRDNewZealand/)[__](https://twitter.com/HRDNewZealand)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/hrd-\nnew-zealand)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Key Media ![](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n"}, {"item": "Everything You Need To Know About The Importance Of Employee Recognition -

Its recent release recommends no less than\nthat OFCCP start over (start from scratch) as to the way OFCCP selects\nconstruction contractors for audit. The IG also recommends OFCCP bring its\ngoals program for minorities and women forward 40 years. It is that out of\ndate: almost a half-century. The IG did not address the only other major\ncomponent of OFCCP's construction program: the way OFCCP undertakes\nconstruction audits (which are generally non-controversial, fast-moving, and\nshort duration affairs, although heavy on paperwork gathering and reporting).\n\nAll in all, the IG's Report paints a rather dismal picture of OFCCP neglect of\nits construction contractor program going back at least to the beginning of\nthe Obama Administration and continuing to date in the Trump Administration.\nThe Report, thus, does not suggest political causes for the malaise in OFCCP's\nconstruction program, as opposed to just mere neglect and a lackadaisical\ncomme ci comme \u00e7a approach lacking dedication to excellence in construction\naudits at all levels of OFCCP.\n\nRead more about it in today's [**bonus\nfeature**](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ig-report-blasts-ofccp-\nconstruction-67055/)!\n\n[![OFCCP Week In Review: Bonus Feature - IG Report Blasts OFCCP Construction\nAudits](https://jdsupra-html-images.s3-us-\nwest-1.amazonaws.com/1e2a45e9-dafe-4ef5-8ec2-347bf8b67686-OFCCP-\nWIR_-2_20-Bonus-\nFeature-750x150-Blog4.png)](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ig-report-\nblasts-ofccp-construction-67055/)\n\n## Friday, March 27, 2020: Big Changes Ahead for OFCCP Construction Programs\n\nThe USDOL Inspector General\n[**Report**](https://www.oig.dol.gov/public/reports/oa/2020/04-20-001-14-001.pdf)\non OFCCPs Construction Industry Program malaise reports important changes\ncoming at OFCCP for construction contractors.\n\nThis Inspector General (IG)\n[**Report**](https://www.oig.dol.gov/public/reports/oa/2020/04-20-001-14-001.pdf)\nis a backdoor window reporting on OFCCP's upcoming plans to begin to wrench\nitself out of the construction industry enforcement malaise in which the\nAgency finds itself. Here is what is on the horizon:\n\n  1. ****A centralized audit scheduling \"case management system\" coming in FY 2021 based on contractor risk of non-compliance.****\"Looking forward, OFCCP officials said they planned to implement a new case management system in FY 2021 to include construction modules and reporting capabilities. This new system would allow OFCCP to centralize construction scheduling, giving it the ability to perform data analyses and schedule contractors for compliance evaluations. It would also have features that do not currently exist, such as ad hoc reporting of real-time transactional data and summary counts. Moreover, OFCCP could use this system to schedule contractors by risk of non-compliance.\" _(See pp. 7-8 of IG Report)_\n  2. ****A contractor \"notification of construction contract award portal\" (NCAP) coming.****  \n\"OFCCP has taken significant steps to centralize its scheduling of\nconstruction contractor compliance evaluations to ensure that its scheduling\npolicies and practices comport with the Fourth Amendment standards and case\nlaw, including _Baker DC, LLC v. Acosta,_ No. 1:17-CV-530, 2018 WL 1696799\n(S.D. Ohio Apr. 6, 2018). In this effort, OFCCP has developed a Notification\nof Construction Contract Award Portal (NCAP) in which OFCCP uploads all\ncontract award notifications. OFCCP will use NCAP to develop a central\nscheduling list to neutrally select construction contractors for compliance\nevaluations. OFCCP anticipates making the NCAP portal (sic) available to\nfederal construction contractors and subcontractors for their use in Fiscal\nYear 2020.\" ( _See_ _p. 24 of IG Report which is p.3 of OFCCP 's written\nletter response to the IG's Report.)_ **Editor 's Note:** OFCCP's audit\nselection architecture is to thus \"squeeze from both sides:\" gathering from\nfederal Agency contracting officers information about prime federal Government\nconstruction contracts and also about any subcontractors the federal Agency\ncontracting officers might just be aware. **Note:** There is no reliable,\ncurrent to real-time, or complete system of federal records recording covered\nfederal Government construction subcontracts. OFCCP will gather evidence of\ncovered federal Government construction contracts and subcontracts from\ncovered contractors and subcontractors through the coming NCA portal (or\nNCAP).\n\n**Editor 's Note:** Construction Contractors, please do not forget that OFCCP\nRules already require you to report to OFCCP construction contract awards. See\n[**41 CFR Section 60-4.2(c)**](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-\nidx?SID=55712c3dacbae6b56a93d0cf362a7f6e&mc=true&node=se41.1.60_64_12&rgn=div8).\n\n  3. **A transparent construction audit methodology is coming.** \"OFCCP has committed to publishing its scheduling methodology for construction compliance evaluations.\" OFCCP gave no date. See EDITOR's NOTE below, after #4. **_See_** _the beginning of bottom half of p. 24 of IG Report, which is p.3 of OFCCP 's written letter response to the IG's Report._\n  4. **An OFCCP methodology to identify \"likely (construction contractor) violators\" unknown.** \"\u2026the agency commits to studying the best strategies for identifying and scheduling likely violators in this industry.\" **_See_** _beginning of bottom half of p. 24 of IG Report, which is p.3 of OFCCP 's written letter response to the IG's Report_ **Editor 's Note:** It appears that OFCCP has the NCA portal currently open for the Agency's internal use [\"OFCCP has developed a\u2026NCAP in which OFCCP uploads\"] and is loading NCAP with contract awards. It plans to open the portal to contractors later this Fiscal Year 2020 [\"OFCCP anticipates making the NCAP portal (sic) available to federal construction contractors and subcontractors \u2026 in Fiscal Year 2020\"]. Then, at some later date, it appears OFCCP intends to start using the contract award information in the NCAP to make audit selections. Federal Government agencies, like OFCCP, and especially OFCCP, prefer to launch significant new enforcement programs, like NCAP auditing, at the beginning of a new Fiscal Year. So, the question then becomes whether OFCCP would be ready to start NCAP \"likely violators\" auditing on October 1, 2020 (start of Fiscal Year 2021) or October 1, 2021 (start of Fiscal Year 2022). Because OFCCP has not identified a \"likely violators\" audit selection protocol as of the March 20, 2020 date of its response letter to the IG Report, and since OFCCP has been thinking about this problem since at least the April 2018 (two years ago) decision in the _Baker DC, LLC_ case, and OFCCP is \"working remote\" through this pandemic, it is more likely than not that OFCCP will not be ready and able to commence \"likely violators\" construction contractor audit selections until October 1, 2021 (for FY 2022).\n  5. **OFCCP promising, or not, an update of its 40-year-old construction goals.**  \nOFCCP has pledged to \"Update participation goals for minorities and females,\nand implement processes to keep all participation goals current.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhile engaging in rulemaking to update the participation goals would be an\nextensive undertaking. OFCCP is committed to exploring this option.\" See\nparagraph 2. at bottom 1/3rd of p. 24 of IG Report, which is p.3 of OFCCP's\nwritten letter response to the IG's Report.\n\n**Editor 's Note**: WOW! That was a tepid and evasive lawyer-like OFCCP\nresponse \u2026 \"OFCCP is committed to exploring this option.\" (emphases added)\nOFCCP is obviously going to be dragged kicking and screaming to any update of\nits 40-year-old construction goals. Cutting through the bureaucratic language\nof that remarkable sentence (which at least three senior OFCCP managers likely\nwrestled to finality in collegial body discussion about how to fill the page\nwith words, but say nothing):\n\n- \"committed to exploring\": thus, OFCCP is committed to thinking about the issue, but is not yet committed to updating the goals as the IG recommends.  \n- \"this option\": thus, OFCCP does not think that updating the 40-year-old goals is necessarily the best way to proceed (maybe a Republican Administration does not want to have its fingerprints on a regulatory endorsement of \"goals,\" even though President Nixon's USDOL created and implemented in 1972 the concept of OFCCP \"goals\" in affirmative action planning: not Johnson or Kennedy).\n\nRead all together, OFCCP's response on updated construction goals appears to\nbe an evasive and non-specific answer designed as a long hang-time punt. This\nsuggests OFCCP's current policy position is to put this issue on the back-\nburner and think about it when time permits.\n\nALSO, construction goals raise, again, the long-delayed and overdue goals\nnomenclature problem: what exactly are these goals, what is a \"participation\ngoal\" (and how different from a \"Placement Goal,\" different from a\n\"Utilization Goal,\" and different from a \"Benchmark for hires\") and is the\nword \"participation\" code for numerical or quota hiring? The \"participation\"\ngoal language was born in the Carter Administration OFCCP, which initially\nthought quota hiring and promotions were lawful. Once the Carter OFCCP better\nunderstood that Title VII law did not permit quota employment transactions, it\nfell back to a \"wink-wink\" approach that decried quotas different from goals,\nbut tried to encourage both unknowing, and separately, oftentimes willing,\nrecruiters and HR managers to seize on suggestive language like\n\"participation\" goals which sounded like a sense of obligation (did not sound\nlike an availability measure, but rather sounded like a hiring\nobligation)\u2026i.e., the percentage which has to \"participate:: i.e., be hired\u2026or\nlanguage like \"goals and timetables,\" which suggested an urgency\u2026a near term\nobligation to hit \"the number.\" And, of course, this babble arose among the\ncacophony of many different OFCCP non-regulatory enforcement efforts to enact\nquotas in the form of \"goals\"\u2026like: \"Ultimate Goals,\" \"Interim-Ultimate\nGoals,\" and the \"Whole Person Rule\" (complete with senior Carter OFCCP\nofficials debating internally for a half-day whether contractors should round\nup or round down when calculating fractional percentage goals and converting\nthem to numeric goals for Hiring Managers). Of course, the Clinton\nAdministration formally, in writing, in what are today current OFCCP Rules,\nflatly banned both numerical goals and timetables following on the heels of\nthe Reagan Administration which had sternly banned them, but only via oral\npodium policy.\n\nOFCCP always dreads opening up the discussion as to what the Agency's goals\nreally mean, because it starts OFCCP down very slippery legal slopes. More\ndiscussion about goals also creates greater clarity as to what they are not\nand opens the eyes of many HR Managers who still innocently believe \"goals\"\nare not mere percentage availability calculations designed for the use of\nrecruiters to know if their candidate searches are sufficiently complete and\ninclusive, but rather are a lawful way to somehow implement, in fact,\notherwise unlawful quotas.\n\n## Monday, March 30, 2020: VETS Champion Veteran Hiring Award\n\nAre you looking for something positive to focus on during this tumultuous\ntime? This is an excellent opportunity to reflect on your Veteran Hiring\nachievements in 2019!

The Agency continues to work remotely across the\nprivate and federal sectors, and in its efforts to educate the public about\ntheir workplace rights and responsibilities. The EEOC's private sector\nlitigation continues, following the courts' rules where the cases are filed.\n\n## Wednesday, April 1, 2020: NLRB Final Rule - Three Amendments\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)\n[**announced**](https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-finalizes-\nrulemaking-protect-employee-free-choice) it has finalized a series of\namendments to Part 103 of its Rules and Regulations. The Board believes that\nthese amendments better protect employees' statutory rights of free choice on\nquestions concerning representation. The [**Final\nRule**](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/04/01/2020-06470/representation-\ncase-procedures-election-bars-proof-of-majority-support-in-construction-\nindustry) becomes effective on June 1, 2020.\n\nThe amendments, proposed by the Board on August 12, 2019, and as modified in\nthe Final Rule, include:\u00ad-\n\n### Blocking Charge Policy\n\nThe amendment replaces the current blocking charge policy with either a \"vote-\nand-count\" or a \"vote-and-impound\" procedure. Unfair labor practice charges\nwill no longer block an election.\n\n### Voluntary Recognition Bar\n\nThe amendment returns to the rule of Dana Corp., 351 NLRB 434 (2007). For\nvoluntary recognition under Section 9(a) of the Act to bar a subsequent\nrepresentation petition (and for a post-recognition collective-bargaining\nagreement to have contract-bar effect) unit employees must receive notice that\nvoluntary recognition has been granted and are given a 45-day open period\nwithin which to file an election petition.\n\n### Section 9(a) Recognition in the Construction Industry\n\nThe amendment states that in the construction industry, where bargaining\nrelationships established under Section 8(f) cannot bar petitions for a Board\nelection, proof of a Section 9(a) relationship will require positive evidence\nof majority employee support and cannot be based on contract language alone,\noverruling Staunton Fuel, 335 NLRB 717 (2001).\n\n## Wednesday, April 1, 2020: NLRB Resumes Representation Elections\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)\n[**announced**](https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-resumes-\nrepresentation-elections) it will not extend its temporary suspension of\nBoard-conducted elections past April 3, 2020, and will instead resume\nconducting elections beginning Monday, April 6, 2020.  On [**March 19,\n2020,**](https://directemployers.org/2020/03/23/ofccp-week-in-review-\nmarch-23-2020/) because of the extraordinary circumstances related to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the NLRB had ordered the temporary suspension of all Board-\nconducted elections through April 3, 2020.\n\n## Wednesday, April 1, 2020: DE & NASWA Launched \"NeedAJobNow\" Website\n\nNonprofits [ **DirectEmployers Association**](https://directemployers.org/)\n(DE)and the [ **National Association of State Workforce\nAgencies**](https://naswa.org/) (NASWA),\n[**announced**](https://directemployers.org/2020/04/01/national-labor-\nexchange-launches-job-resource-to-support-displaced-workers-during-pandemic/)\nthe launch of [ **NeedAJobNow.USNLx.com**](https://needajobnow.usnlx.com/).\nThe new job site provides a centralized location for displaced workers to\naccess employment opportunities from U.S. corporations with immediate hiring\nneeds due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

Through this initiative, DirectEmployers and\nNASWA will assist in bridging the gap between job supply and demand by\noffering an easy way for job seekers to gain access to current open positions\nand for employers to fill positions quickly and efficiently during these\ndifficult times.\n\n## Wednesday, April 1, 2020: IRS Issued FAQs on FFCRA Sick Leave and Tax\nCredits\n\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) requires employers to\nprovide paid leave through two separate provisions:\n\n  * the Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act (EPSLA), which entitles workers to up to 80 hours of paid sick time when they are unable to work for specific reasons related to COVID-19\n  * the Emergency Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act (Expanded FMLA), which entitles workers to certain paid family and medical leave.\n\nThe FFCRA provides that employers subject to the EPSLA and the Expanded FMLA\npaid leave requirements are entitled to fully refundable tax credits to cover\nthe cost of the leave required to be paid for these periods of time during\nwhich employees are unable to work (which for purposes of these rules,\nincludes telework). Certain self-employed persons in similar circumstances are\nentitled to similar credits.\n\nRead an overview of the COVID-19-Related Tax Credits for Small and Midsize\nBusinesses and frequently asked questions on the [**IRS\nwebsite**](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/covid-19-related-tax-credits-for-\nrequired-paid-leave-provided-by-small-and-midsize-businesses-faqs).\n\n### Where can I get more information?\n\n  * **[Coronavirus Tax Relief](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus)** ** **\n  * Department of Labor's **[COVID-19 and the American Workplace](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/pandemic/)**\n\n## Wednesday, April 1, 2020: OFCCP Ensured Data Safety\n\nThe Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP)\n[**assured**](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOLOFCCP/bulletins/28384ee)\nthe general public that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Agency is \"securely\nteleworking,\" and \"remains committed to safeguarding any nonpublic,\nconfidential, and sensitive data it receives from contractors and complainants\nduring compliance evaluations and investigations.\"\n\nAccording to the statement, OFCCP has had a long-standing policy that requires\ncompliance officers to store information received from contractors on the\nAgency's secure network. The network is only accessible using government-\nissued computers through the Agency's secure VPN. Also, all compliance\nofficers are required to complete annual training from DOL and OFCCP on\nsafeguarding data.\n\nContractors also have the option to send their data to OFCCP via their\ncompany's secure data or email portals.\n\n## Thursday, April 2, 2020: World Autism Awareness Day\n\nApril 2, 2020, marked the thirteenth annual World Autism Awareness Day.\n\nJoined by the international community, hundreds of thousands of landmarks,\nbuildings, homes, and communities around the world come together to  **[Light\nIt Up Blue](https://www.autismspeaks.org/how-light-it-blue)** in recognition\nof people with autism and those who love and support them.\n\n**[Autism-friendly events](https://www.autismspeaks.org/events)**  and\neducational activities will take place during the month of April, aiming to\nincrease understanding and acceptance of people with autism, foster worldwide\nsupport, and to inspire a kinder, more inclusive world.\n\nJoin us for **[World Autism Awareness\nMonth](https://www.autismspeaks.org/kindness)** to help us spread kindness and\nautism awareness!

This meant she had to find a\nway to get new employees motivated while steering them into practicing the\nvalues of the company\u2014not an easy task when many of them work from home\noffices and live in different states.\n\nAlthough the business is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Christopherson's\nremote workforce is spread across Alabama, California, Colorado and Michigan\nand includes employees working at 35 client-dedicated onsite locations. To\ndesign an effective employee recognition system, Garn knew she had to select a\nplatform that could convey appreciation for work that might otherwise go\nunnoticed.\n\n\"We have a very segmented workforce across the U.S. with 60 percent operating\nout of a home office, and that meant we had to help them feel connected to the\nbusiness through a technology platform because these are employees that we\nmight see only once a year,\" she said. \"Other than phone calls to their\nmanagers, they really didn't have a lot of connection to the business.\"\n\nGarn chose employee recognition and rewards software from Motivosity Inc.,\nbased in Provo, Utah. Its platform encourages employees to recognize their\npeers and offers small monetary bonuses for doing good work.\n\nAt Christopherson, employees are given $5 in their recognition account each\nmonth. (Motivosity executives say the optimal amount of \"giving\" money is $5\nper month, but companies can set whatever amount they want for employees to\nuse for rewards.)\n\nWhen employees want to recognize a co-worker's efforts, they write a statement\ndescribing what they are commending and use money from their account to reward\nthe person for his or her good deeds. When the statement is posted, users\nacross the company can read the message, but the amount attached to the\nappreciation is not visible.\n\nThe platform reinforces corporate values by reflecting one of the company's\nguiding principles, such as enabling teamwork or showing respect for candor.\n\nApproximately 230 workers, including the chief executive officer, company\nmanagers and workers in Christopherson's operations departments, use the\nsystem, which Garn said has made it easier for her to gauge employee\nsatisfaction.\n\nAlthough the company is still gathering data, she noted that, since\nimplementing the platform 18 months ago, the Employee Net Promoter Score\n(eNPS) for those using the system rose by 26 points. The eNPS is used to gauge\nthe loyalty of Christopherson's employees to the brand.\n\nOther companies such as 15Five, Kudos, Bonusly, Terryberry and Ultimate\nSoftware are presenting HR managers with a variety of employee recognition\nsoftware platforms that encourage better customer service, excellent team\nspirit, or improved communications among employees, to name a few.\n\n _[SHRM members-only toolkit : _[_Developing and Sustaining Employee\nEngagement_](/resourcesandtools/tools-and-\nsamples/toolkits/pages/sustainingemployeeengagement.aspx) _]_\n\nRecognition Goes Beyond KPIs\n\nUsing employee recognition technology can help companies operationalize the\nactions they need to take to motivate employees, said Scott Johnson, founder\nand CEO at Motivosity.\n\nJohnson said that a decade ago, the playbook for a strong culture was\nunlimited personal time off, awesome break rooms with lots of free food,\ncompany activities like golf tournaments, great company parties and an annual\nday at the amusement park.\n\n\"All of those things together helped people believe their company was going\nplaces and what they did mattered. But what was interesting to me was that not\neverybody felt like that was enough. And some of the top performers even felt\nlike maybe the grass is greener somewhere else,\" he said.\n\nEmployee recognition and rewards software has shifted the paradigm in how\ncompanies assess their employees, Johnson said. Typically, managers have\nmeasured employees' key performance indicators (KPIs), he said, tying the\nnumbers associated with productivity, sales, quality and timeliness to company\nearnings.\n\nWith today's employee recognition platforms, an employee's efforts at\nimproving communications, boosting morale or bettering the workplace\nenvironment are some of the endeavors that can be viewed as worthy of\nappreciation.\n\n\"Peer-to-peer recognition breaks down silos and causes employees to look for\nways to help each other. The company can look at the data to better understand\nengagement patterns,\" Johnson said.\n\nThings to Consider First\n\nTo make sure implementing employee recognition software is a success, Mike\nBrennan, president and chief service officer at Leapgen, a Manhattan Beach,\nCalif.-based HR consulting firm, said HR executives should focus first on\nthree areas before they think about the technology: the mindset, the people\nand the process.\n\nBrennan said that if companies don't have the mindset to commit to building a\nnew vision and accepting change, or don't have the right people to implement\nprocesses that define business outcomes, then implementing employee\nrecognition software initiatives will fail.\n\n\"Companies can place too much emphasis on software, but if you don't have\npeople who are ready to leverage the software, whether that is peers who are\nready to recognize one another or managers who are ready to recognize their\nteams, then you will only get a fraction of the value you have envisioned,\" he\nsaid.\n\nWhen he advises HR executives on employee recognition software, they usually\nwant to amplify the culture they have or they wish to establish a better\nculture through a transformation.\n\n\"For instance, recent employee engagement surveys may have suggested the need\nto recognize one another for living a company's core values as one component\nof improving the workforce experience,\" Brennan said. \"Employee recognition\nsoftware enables them to do that at scale and on an ongoing basis.\"\n\n_Nicole Lewis is a freelance journalist based in Miami.

Mid-mission the surprise was revealed\nwhen, with scissors in hand, he set to work, even enlisting cosmonaut Anton\nShkaplerov for vacuuming duties.\n\nAs lessons in what creates great engagement go, this one is literally out of\nthis world. But it\u2019s also much more than this.\n\n####  **Great employee recognition means making it personal**\n\n\u201cVirts tells this story in terms of how it\u2019s crucial to understand individual\nemployee recognition,\u201d says Luke D\u2019Arcy, UK president of ad agency Momentum\nWorldwide, who last year spent two months at Harvard to learn more about staff\nengagement and heard this anecdote direct.\n\n\u201cHe learnt from others that her appearance mattered, especially as the only\nfemale. So he chose to recognise her great work with this gesture. The\nengagement it created was so powerful. That\u2019s when the penny dropped for me\nabout what we could do in our organisation.\u201d\n\nMr D\u2019Arcy now has measures in place to make recognition of his own people a\nlot more personal, including recently sending high performers with families to\nDisneyland, Florida, on a learning trip, rather than flying Disney executives\nin, because he knew the gesture would give his staff the chance [to extend\ntheir time away and have a family break.](https://www.raconteur.net/business-\ninnovation/time-off-boost-productivity)\n\nFor some, who value other things, employee recognition is different; it\u2019s\ntrips to the theatre, or even something very simple, like letting an employee,\nwho he knew had just moved house and would be busy unpacking, start late.\n\n\u201cRecognition is the secret ingredient to engagement, motivation and overall\nbusiness success,\u201d argues Dawn Smedley, culture and engagement strategist at\nrecognition experts O.C. Tanner Europe. \u201cAnd, in today\u2019s diverse workforce\nenvironment, having a personal approach to recognition is more important than\never.\u201d\n\n####  **Peer-to-peer recognition does not work for everyone**\n\nBut the trouble is, even when employee recognition occurs \u2013 a damning Gallup\nsurvey showed 65 per cent of staff haven\u2019t received any in the last year \u2013\nmuch of it fails at this more personal point of delivery.\n\n\u201cRecognition is all about the manner staff are appreciated,\u201d explains Shainaz\nFirfiray, associate professor of human resources management at Warwick\nBusiness School. \u201cA on-size-fits-all approach comes across as superficial and\nempty. What employees really want is for their efforts to be noticed with\npersonalised appreciation, something that\u2019s relevant to them. Often it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n[Trailblazers in taking a more personal approach to recognition are US\nstartups. ](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/social-employee-recognition-heart-of-\ntalent-management-strategy)For example, each Friday the entire team at LA-\nbased SnackNation take it in turns to go around the room and celebrate someone\nthey think has helped them that week.\n\nThese so-called Crush it Calls are whoop-whoops that might make us Brits\ncringe and, for introverts, it\u2019s probably the very definition of what\u2019s\nmortifying. But, argue experts, that\u2019s the whole point of making things\nbespoke, doing what you know will work for one, but not the other.\n\n\u201cKnowing people as individuals means not making generalisations,\u201d says Amrit\nSandhar, founder of The Engagement Coach. \u201cIt\u2019s realising that extraverts\nmight like the whole company to know they do a great job, but maybe a\nhandwritten card with voucher is all the person who likes to stay under the\nradar needs.\u201d\n\n####  **Rewards should never be used to solve business problems**\n\nBeing personal doesn\u2019t just mean employee recognition budgets can work harder\n\u2013 for some, small tokens work better than grand gifts \u2013 i[t can actually save\nfirms creating\ndisengagement.](https://www.raconteur.net/infographics/7-reasons-why-\nbusinesses-need-to-prioritise-employee-engagement)\n\nA famous Harvard Business School experiment found that when a laundry firm\nintroduced a prize draw to recognise perfect monthly attendance, productivity\nactually fell by 6 to 8 per cent because those who routinely arrived on time\nanyway disliked how those habitually late were now potentially being rewarded\nto do something they considered normal. It strikingly reveals how staff values\nare important to understand and recognise too.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing you can use employee recognition schemes for is to solve a\nproblem [like attendance],\u201d argues Rita Trehan, author of _Unleashing\nCapacity_ , and former human resources director at AGL Energy. \u201cThis is also\nwhen understanding people\u2019s values come in. For some, there is a difference\nbetween reward and appreciation. If it\u2019s the latter, money won\u2019t engage them.\u201d\n\nAligning recognition to values is predicted to be the next big step in reward,\naccording to Mr Sandhar. \u201cGrouping people as millennials or Generation X\ncreates confusion,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s not just the young that value\nhaving a sense of purpose, so organisations need to tap into people\u2019s\noutlooks. By rewarding along these lines, staff then create more value of\ntheir own, in terms of extra productivity, to the business. It\u2019s a virtuous\ncircle. But the only way to do this is via regular management check-ins.\u201d\n\n####  **Personalising recognition must come from company culture**\n\n[![](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/EE_p6_2-e1559664224696.jpg)](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/EE_p6_2-e1559664224696.jpg)Knowing people at an\nindividual level can, of course, feel like an onerous task for some\norganisations. But at 100-year-old high street jeweller Beaverbrooks, its\nmanaging director Anna Blackburn says it needn\u2019t be. \u201cI hold at least 12 focus\ngroups a year to understand exactly what type of recognition staff want,\u201d she\nsays.\n\n\u201cSome really enjoy being part of a league we run, where we recognise the best\nperforming stores, while others have [highlighted wanting to take time off for\nvolunteering or fundraising,](https://www.raconteur.net/business-\ninnovation/10-quirky-employee-benefits-that-have-been-effective) which we do\nwith a promise to double-match what they raise.\n\n\u201cWe specifically want our managers to really get to know staff, so on-the-spot\nemployee recognition feels authentic and appropriate to them, be it giving\ntime off so they can go to their kid\u2019s nativity, to giving cakes, flowers,\nwine, small items of jewellery.\u201d\n\nMs Blackburn attributes this personal approach to employee recognition as part\nof what keeps staff stay, with 30 per cent having 15 years\u2019 service or more.\nAnd her ethos is now being followed by others.\n\n\u201cMeals out really work for some employees, for others it\u2019s a weekend away or\nvouchers according to performance targets,\u201d says Karen Barley, head of sales\noperations at Hattons, the specialist in rare and exclusive coins. \u201cOn top of\nthis are more general activities like the chance to win a car, team socials\nand even taking the entire team to Ibiza.\n\n\u201cBut given we hire people from all walks of life \u2013 we have former midwives,\nex-care assistants and hairdressers \u2013 it\u2019s the tailored approach we want to\ntake. When each new employee joins, we specifically ask what engages them;\ntypically it\u2019s anything experiential rather than money.\u201d\n\nGet employee recognition right though and true engagement could only be a\nshort step away. As O.C. Tanner\u2019s Ms Smedley concludes: \u201cWith a more\nindividual approach to recognition,[ everyone from the cleaner to the CEO can\nbe commended. ](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/new-job-titles)This is absolutely\nkey for both and everyone in-between.\u201d\n\n# Four top tips on recognition\n\n **1 Understand people**\n\n **\u201c** It\u2019s vital you understand people\u2019s aspirations,\u201d says Teresa Boughey at\nstrategic human resources consultancy Jungle HR. \u201cFor some, recognition might\nbe an opportunity to do stretch-learning. Others need more regular guidance\nand support. Once you tune in to what individuals want, you can start to see\nif what you already offer fits in with the majority position.\u201d\n\n **2** **Involve colleagues**\n\n **\u201c** Our employees are worldwide, so we recognise each month by asking\ncolleagues for peer-to-peer feedback,\u201d says Lee Ali, managing director and\nexhibition specialist at Expo Stars \u201cWe find the biggest motivation people can\nget is recognition from their peers; they literally walk two inches taller and\nhave a genuine spring in their step.\u201d\n\n **3 Offer choice**\n\n\u201cWhile absolute personalisation is the ultimate ideal, in reality employers\nwith lots of staff might find the most practical way to crack this nut is to\noffer a range of rewards or benefits from which staff can select,\u201d says Rachel\nMeadows, director at Broadstone Financial Solutions. \u201cThis might be via flex,\nvoluntary benefits, or a total reward or \u2018recognition pot\u2019 approach.\u201d\n\n **4** **Be aware**\n\n\u201cA risk of having different recognition for different people is that you can\nforget that even those who like money still like a thank you every so often\ntoo,\u201d says Jungle HR\u2019s Ms Boughey. \u201cNot saying this enough can disillusion\nthem.\u201d\n\nAlso found in [Employee Recognition](https://www.raconteur.net/tag/employee-\nrecognition)

Taylor Jr., a human-resources expert, is tackling your questions\nas part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society\nfor Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society._\n\n _The questions are submitted by readers, and Taylor's answers below have been\nedited for length and clarity._\n\n **Have a question?** Do you have an HR or work-related question you\u2019d like me\nto answer? [Submit it\nhere](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/01/18/hr-ask-our-\nexpert/1040330001/).\n\n **Question: My company has stopped recognizing employee birthdays and other\nlife accomplishments. Isn\u2019t it important for a company to offer such\nrecognition? \u2013 Anonymous**\n\n _Johnny C. Taylor Jr.:_ People remember how you make them feel. Recognizing\nteam members is one of the most basic and fundamental things we as business\nleaders, people managers and HR professionals do.\n\nI suggest you speak with your HR department to better understand this\ndecision. A conversation would allow you to offer a compelling justification\nin support of recognition.\n\nBehind the decision might be several factors, including cost. If this is the\ncase, ask if your company\u2019s leadership has considered sending an email, making\na phone call or personally congratulating someone on a life event. These\nefforts are free but can have significant value to the person on the receiving\nend.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that leadership sees recognition as a lesser priority.\nEmployee recognition often falls to the HR department, which has significant\nother responsibilities.\n\nSome companies opt to have monthly department birthday celebrations. This is\nnot as personal, but it can help with team building. If you suggest this, make\nsure that the gesture has meaning, a leader participates and individuals being\nrecognized are named and celebrated.\n\nWhen organizations don\u2019t mark life accomplishments, they sometimes do so out\nof fear that they will miss one or appear to be discriminatory.\n\nAdditionally, some life events should not be shared publicly. Being cancer-\nfree after five years certainly is a significant event for an employee, but an\nemployer could violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\nand privacy concerns by broadcasting the news.\n\nSo, whether it\u2019s important for a company to mark employee life events could\ndepend upon the nature of the events and specifics involved.\n\nWhat is most appropriate is recognizing work-related milestones such as work\nanniversaries, promotions or the successful completion of big projects. These\nefforts can be made personal by singling out employees for their\naccomplishments while focusing on the values of your workplace.\n\nRecognition is a vital part of a healthy workplace culture. It should begin\nwith recognizing jobs done well, celebrating achievements toward advancing the\ncompany\u2019s mission, capturing stories that are inspiring and sharing the\nlessons teams have learned.\n\nAfter all, an exceptional team is coached, trained, rewarded \u2013 and recognized\n\u2013 for the things that make a team great.\n\n **Q: I was subpoenaed to testify in court. My employer informed me that I'd\nhave to use vacation or personal time to comply with the court\u2019s request. That\ndoesn't seem right, as attendance is mandated by a governmental entity with\npunishment for not showing up. Is it? \u2013 Mark**\n\n _Taylor:_ Generally, employers are not required to pay employees for time off\nfor court proceedings. But there may be exceptions.\n\nIf employees give ample notice and request time off for a court-related\nabsence, employers in most states are prohibited from taking adverse action\nagainst them.\n\nAn example is Virginia, where I work. Employers in the state are not required\nto pay employees for time away for a mandated-court appearance or jury duty,\nbut the employer is specifically prohibited from penalizing employees for such\nan absence.\n\nOther states handle this differently. In California and Georgia, employers are\nrequired by law to provide regular pay and benefits during mandated court\nappearances (at least for a period of time).\n\nBecause laws vary from state to state, seek guidance from your company\u2019s HR or\nlegal department to determine the specifics for your situation.\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?display=popup&app_id=215046668549694&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fcolumnist%2F2019%2F09%2F10%2Fhonoring-\nemployee-accomplishments-essential-workplace-\nculture%2F2147061001%2F)[](http://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fcolumnist%2F2019%2F09%2F10%2Fhonoring-\nemployee-accomplishments-essential-workplace-\nculture%2F2147061001%2F&text=Employee%20recognition%20a%20vital%20part%20of%20workplace%20culture%3A%20Ask%20HR&via=usatoday)[](mailto:?subject=Employee%20recognition%20a%20vital%20part%20of%20workplace%20culture%3A%20Ask%20HR%20-%20from%20USA%20TODAY&body=Employee%20recognition%20a%20vital%20part%20of%20workplace%20culture%3A%20Ask%20HR%0A%0ARecognizing%20team%20members%20is%20one%20of%20the%20most%20basic%20and%20fundamental%20things%20we%20as%20business%20leaders%2C%20people%20managers%20and%20HR%20professionals%20do.%0A%0ACheck%20out%20this%20story%20on%20USATODAY.com%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fmoney%2Fcolumnist%2F2019%2F09%2F10%2Fhonoring-\nemployee-accomplishments-essential-workplace-culture%2F2147061001%2F)\n\n[](/money/)\n\n[](/money/)\n\n[About Us](https://marketing.usatoday.com/about/) [Newsroom\nStaff](/contact/staff/) [Ethical Principles](https://cm.usatoday.com/ethical-\nconduct/) [Corrections](/story/news/2013/01/09/corrections-\nclarifications/1821023/) [Press Releases](/pr/)\n[Accessibility](https://cm.usatoday.com/accessibility/) [Sitemap](/sitemap/)\n[Terms of Service](https://cm.usatoday.com/terms/) [Your California Privacy\nRights/Privacy Policy](https://cm.usatoday.com/privacy-policy) [Privacy\nPolicy](https://cm.usatoday.com/privacy) [Do Not Sell My Info/Cookie\nPolicy](https://cm.usatoday.com/cookie-policy)\n\n[Contact Us](https://marketing.usatoday.com/contact/) [Help\nCenter](https://help.usatoday.com/) [My\nAccount](https://account.usatoday.com/) [Give Feedback]() [Get Home\nDelivery](https://offers.usatoday.com/FOOTERLINK?opm_position=footer&opm_creative=link&opm_name=get-\nhome-delivery&opm_id=65&keycode=w6azn)\n[eNewspaper](https://user.usatoday.com/user/enewspaper) [USA TODAY\nShop](http://onlinestore.usatoday.com/storefront.aspx) [Reprints &\nPermissions](http://www.gannettreprints.com/)\n[Advertise](http://marketing.usatoday.com/advertise/)\n[Careers](http://www.gannett.com/careers/)\n[Internships](http://internships.usatoday.com/) [Support Local\nBusiness](https://supportlocal.usatoday.com/)\n\n[News Tips](https://newstips.usatoday.com/)\n[Podcasts](/pages/interactives/podcasts/)\n[Newsletters](https://profile.usatoday.com/newsletters/manage/) [Mobile\nApps](http://static.usatoday.com/mobile-apps/)\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/usatoday)\n[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/usatoday)\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/usatoday)\n[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/company/usa-today)\n[Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/usatoday/)\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/USATODAY)\n[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/usatoday)\n[Flipboard](https://flipboard.com/@USAToday?utm_source=USAToday&utm_medium=follow&utm_campaign=publisher)\n[RSS](https://feeds.feedblitz.com/usatoday-NewsTopStories)\n\n[10Best](https://www.10best.com/) [Grateful](https://www.makeitgrateful.com/)\n[Reviewed](https://www.reviewed.com/)\n[Thanksgiving.com](https://www.makeitgrateful.com/thanksgiving-holiday/) [Job\nNetwork](https://jobs.usatoday.com/)\n[Moonlighting](https://www.gomnlt.com/gci/usa-today/?utm_source=usa-\ntoday&utm_medium=navweblink&utm_campaign=GCI) [Sports\nWeekly](https://sportsweekly.usatoday.com/hsfooter) [Studio\nGannett](http://www.studiogci.com/)\n[Classifieds](http://classifieds.usatoday.com/)\n\n[The City](https://www.thecitypodcast.com/) [The Wall](/border-wall/)\n[Storytellers](https://www.storytellersproject.com/)\n\n\u00a9 2020 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.\n\n"}, {"item": "5 HR Tech Trends to Look Out for in 2020 and Beyond -

When discussing their employee\nrecognition programs, they report that their current programs aren\u2019t working \u2013\nthey are not having a positive impact on employees or workplace morale. And,\nin many cases, the ways that most employee recognition programs are\nimplemented actually create _negative_ _reactions_ among team members.\n\n* * *\n\n## Follow [Ladders on Flipboard](https://flipboard.com/@Ladders)!\n\nFollow Ladders\u2019 magazines on Flipboard covering\n[Happiness](https://flipboard.com/@ladders/happiness-0vgvgbmgy),\n[Productivity](https://flipboard.com/@ladders/productivity-38lkjnboy), [Job\nSatisfaction](https://flipboard.com/@ladders/job-satisfaction-kf255kjby),\n[Neuroscience](https://flipboard.com/@ladders/science-iqk2flcry), and\n[more](https://flipboard.com/@Ladders)!\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nWhy? Because, as generally implemented, **_recognition is very different from\nauthentic appreciation._ **Here is what we found:\n\n_Recognition is largely about behavior_ **.** \u201cCatch them doing what you want\nand recognize it,\u201d the recognition books say. The sole focus is on the\nemployee\u2019s behavior and the manager\u2019s behavior (observe and reinforce). This\nis an \u201cok\u201d starting point, but doesn\u2019t really get to the heart of the matter.\n\n_The primary emphasis of recognition is improving performance_ **.** The goal\nis for employees to do more (or better quality) work. Often, the focus is on\nwhat is good for the company or the manager (who looks good when the team\nperforms well). Many employees see this \u2013 and resent it.\n\n_The relational direction of recognition is top down._ Recognition comes from\nthe administration, managers, and supervisors. It is occasionally communicated\npeer to peer, but rarely from worker to supervisor or manager. And, as I\u2019ve\nshared elsewhere, [younger workers are less impacted by their\nsupervisor](https://www.appreciationatwork.com/blog/the-changing-workplace-\nthe-importance-of-peer-to-peer-appreciation/) than they are their colleagues.\n\n_Recognition is really an organizational function._ And, as a result,\nrecognition at its foundation feels impersonal and contrived, and is rarely\nexperienced as a genuine expression of appreciation for the team member as a\nperson.\n\n## **What Team Members Want: Authentic Appreciation**\n\nConversely, authentic appreciation has a very different feel and quality:\n\n_Appreciation focuses on performance plus the character qualities of the team\nmember and the person\u2019s intrinsic value._ As a result, team members can be\nvalued and receive appreciation both for doing tasks well, and even when they\ndon\u2019t perform well. This is important because only the top 10-15% of employees\nare recognized for high level performance, which leaves your 50-60% of solid\nmiddle team members who never hear anything. Appreciation fills the gaps.\n\n_Appreciation has dual objectives: to improve performance but also to support\nand encourage the person._ Team members often need a word or action of\nencouragement, either when they are learning new roles and skills or when they\naren\u2019t performing at their best because of other issues going on in their\nlives.\n\n_The goal of appreciation is what is good for the company _and_ what is good\nfor the person._ If a colleague communicates authentic appreciation, it is\nbased in a foundational concern for the individual (which may mean helping the\nperson find a position that is a better match for her than her current role).\n\n_Appreciation requires more than behavior; it requires \u201cheart attitude.\u201d_ This\nis really the difficult part of appreciation\u2014it has to be genuine. You can\u2019t\nfake it. But you can learn how to appreciate others (even difficult\ncolleagues) by getting to know them better and what they contribute to the\norganization.\n\n_Appreciation can be communicated in any direction._ One of the exciting\nlessons I\u2019ve learned is that colleagues want to know how to encourage and\nsupport one another. Appreciation can be expressed from anyone to anyone else\nin the organization \u2013 it is not driven by the organizational chart.\n\n_Appreciation is based in a person-to-person relationship._ **** We don\u2019t\nbelieve that an organization (an entity) can truly _appreciate_ an employee or\nteam member. That is why so many employees react to recognition programs\u2014the\nrecognition doesn\u2019t feel genuine at a personal level.\n\nEmployee recognition programs work well when they are used for the purpose for\nwhich they were originally designed\u2014to recognize and reward achieving\nperformance goals. Recognition, however, does _not_ work well when\norganizations try to use large organizational programs to make employees feel\nvalued individually. In fact, this often creates negative backlash within the\norganization (sarcasm and resentment).\n\nAuthentic appreciation communicated personally in ways that are meaningful to\nthe recipient is what helps team members feel truly valued.

Tanner's Alexander Lovell, Manager of Institute Research & Assessment,\nexplains in the recent Hays Journal, workplace culture comprises six elements:\npurpose, opportunity, success, appreciation, wellbeing and leadership.\n\n\"Recognition has a tangible impact on each one of them. When it is used to\nimprove culture, we have seen a significant impact on an organisation's\nability to retain, engage and attract talent,\" said Lovell.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637213360039891507.jpg)](/us/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218599)\n\n#### [COVID-19: HR's main challenges revealed](/us/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218599)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637215281510472121.jpg)](/us/news/general/boeing-\noffers-workers-voluntary-layoff-option/218890)\n\n#### [Boeing offers workers 'voluntary' layoff\noption](/us/news/general/boeing-offers-workers-voluntary-layoff-option/218890)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0223_637214253526069773.jpg)](/us/news/general/global-\nfirm-to-help-develop-medical-equipment-for-covid-19/218734)\n\n#### [Global firm to help develop medical equipment for\nCOVID-19](/us/news/general/global-firm-to-help-develop-medical-equipment-for-\ncovid-19/218734)\n\n\"For example, we saw engagement increase 129% in organisations that move from\nweak to strong recognition practices. Additionally, people stay with an\norganisation two to four years longer when best practice service recognition\nis implemented.\n\nShapley added that employee appreciation doesn't have to be expensive to be\nbeneficial.\n\n\"Instead, it's more about taking the time to recognise success and make your\nemployees feel valued.\n\nIt should be personal and therefore more effective. Good bosses know what\nmotivates and engages their staff and will take the time to treat them as\nindividuals.\n\n**Here 's Hays's advice on successful staff recognition:**  \n**Say 'thank you'**: As Lovell r explains, a deliberate 'thank you' increases\nan employee's feeling of appreciation by 116%, spontaneous praise increases it\nby 172%, while formal recognition increases appreciation by 355%.\n\n**Recognition from the top:  **Effective employee recognition must be led from\nthe top, with the employer or manager recognising the contributions of\nemployees. This could be in tangible ways, such as presenting an award, or\nintangible ways, such as verbal praise.\n\n**Don 't forget peer-to-peer recognition: **Peer-to-peer recognition sees\neveryone in the organisation play a part in recognising the often quiet but\ncritical high performers.\n\n**Utilise internal social media:**  Many modern recognition programmes use\ninternal social media, such as recognition-specific tools or apps, to\ninstantly recognise workers who go the extra mile, with the results displayed\non the staff intranet or company social channels so that anyone can see them.\n\n**Annual events:**  Annual recognition awards events single out the top\nperformers, for example in the customer service arena or for demonstrating\ncompany values. The effect is often to inspire other employees to do the same.\n\nIn one final tip, Adam points out that a successful recognition program\ninvolves recognising not just what an employee has achieved but also how they\nachieved it.\n\n\"Employers need to be clear about what they are recognising people for,\" said\nShapley. \"All too often, recognition is for a successful outcome. It should\nalso focus on how the employee achieved the desired result.\"\n\n### Related stories\n\n  * [Three innovative staff perks at

there are more jobs than qualified candidates in this tight labor\nmarket, you\u2019re probably doing what you can to keep the talent you have intent\non staying with your company and doing their best work.\n\nBut will that be enough?\n\nA big part of that answer depends on how well you reward and recognize\nemployees.\n\nHere\u2019s why.\n\nIn a recent CareerBuilder survey, 50% of employees said they would stay at\ntheir current job if they were tangibly recognized for their efforts. The same\nsurvey showed 40% wouldn\u2019t bother to go above and beyond their assigned job\nduties if they don\u2019t feel meaningfully recognized.\n\nIf those numbers don\u2019t worry you, think about this one: 53% of workers are\nwilling to \u201cquickly leave the company for a slightly better offer,\u201d according\nto a Gallup poll in 2018.\n\nThat would be way[ too much churn](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/big-\nreason-workers-want-to-quit-and-whatll-retain-them/).\n\nMany HR pros today struggle to find a way to get top management to realize\nthat putting a cash bonus in the paycheck once a year isn\u2019t how you make\n[staff feel valued. ](https://www.hrmorning.com/news/majority-of-employees-\ncontinually-look-for-new-jobs-study-says/)Ten years ago it was fine, but there\nwere more workers than jobs back then, remember?\n\nToday\u2019s employees need to be tangibly appreciated frequently -- like saying\n\"amazing job!\" in real-time, or even better, in a public setting like a team\nmeeting \u2013 and in bigger ways (like a commissioned custom oil painting, which\nis what global entertainment giant Scopely does) for taking the team to the\nnext level.\n\nNeed ideas? Here are 13 ways other companies put time, effort and money into\nrecognizing the talent they have.\n\n## Encourage employees to recognize each other\n\nIt makes perfect sense to encourage employees to pat each other on the back\nand give the recognition deserved \u2013 after all, coworkers are the first to see\nthe sweat and blood that goes into exceeding company expectations!\n\nThis can be a somewhat informal system, or program based; it can include\ngifting or not.\n\n    * Create an online kudos form on the company intranet that employees can access. Have them explain why their coworker is deserving of recognition and make that recognition viewable to everyone on the site. Repurpose the kudos in the company newsletter as well. TINYpulse reports that 44% of workers give peer recognition when they have a tool to do so.  Software programs are available to make this happen if it\u2019s not something the IT department can set up on your intranet.\n    * Peer-to-Peer recognition tools can enable employees to give a shout-out to a fellow worker for saving the day or a project well-completed. Those shout-outs can accumulate, and the \u201cpoints\u201d can be used for prizes. At the tech company Motley Fool, employees let each other know about a job well done 35 times a day on average!\n    * Online shoe retailer Zappos has a monetized peer recognition program that allows employees to recognize each other\u2019s hard work through incentives. One program allows an employee to give a coworker $50 for going above and beyond.  The second program, their Zollar Program, allows employees to rack up recognitions as points on a gift card that can be used to buy things like a gym bag or a desk fan.\n\n## **Recognition readily available**\n\nRecruit the owners, the executives and middle management to be committed to\nrewarding good work well and often.\n\nHere are some really effective on-the-spot practices. Some are applicable to a\nwhole team and some focus on a single employee:\n\n    * It takes time on the manager\u2019s part, but crafting a short note thanking a worker for their dedication and naming specifically what they are being lauded for can make [an employee feel tremendously valued.](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/boost-employee-engagement-with-people-skills/) This is something that should be sincere, legible, and done pretty quickly (within a day or two) of the employee\u2019s act or success. It can be left on their desk or handed to them in the course of the day.\n    * When an employee or team of workers has gone beyond the call of duty to get a project completed by deadline, or saved the day after a near-disaster, managers could reach into the company stash and present the team with company apparel. A free T-shirt or ball cap that has the current logo is an inexpensive way to say, \u201cthank you.\u201d Just make sure it\u2019s not a hodgepodge of old stuff with outdated logos, because that really kills the effect.\n    * Provide managers with a supply of gift cards of small dollar amounts that can be given on the spot when someone is doing something right. Companies can get these cards from discount sites (Living Social, Groupon) or warehouse stores like Costco to stretch the budget. Instant recognition is a huge morale boost to the employee and their coworkers, who see someone being valued and know it could be them next. Don\u2019t make this clunky by having to put in a requisition and getting the gift card 45 days later, because the moment is lost.\n    * Exceeding goals, making a somewhat unrealistic deadline or finishing a huge project can all be rewarded with an email to the team saying, \u201cit\u2019s a beautiful afternoon, go enjoy it\u201d or \u201cI appreciate how hard you\u2019ve all worked, feel free to leave for the day and enjoy yourself.\u201d\n    * A manager who knows the employee\u2019s favorite coffee shop or candy bar can leave a small reward on their desk with a sticky note thanking them for a job well done. For a team, bringing in donuts or bagels in the morning (with gluten free options) or arranging for an ice cream truck to come by one afternoon for a treat on the company\u2019s dime is definitely a morale booster.  If you really want management to walk the walk of employee recognition, have bosses create the \u201cindoor food truck\u201d experience by going to each department with a cart of ice cream treats (like Klondike Bars and ice cream sandwiches). If it\u2019s wintertime do a cocoa cart with hot cocoa, whipped cream and peppermint sticks.\n    * Consider creating a point system for employee kudos and pair it with peer-to-peer and management recognition. Point values are assigned to the thank-you and can be built up for the employee to use in a catalog. Several outlets provide companies with catalogs featuring different levels of gifts, from thermal lunch totes to recliners and televisions. \n\n## **Budgeted recognition**\n\nYou\u2019ve already been adding to their benefits menu, workday flexibility and\neven helping employees pay back student loans. All these things draw talent to\nyour open positions, but now you need to keep them happy long-term.\n\nThe rewards programs listed here come with a cost, but the companies using\nthem want to make sure their top performers feel appreciated:\n\n    * Yankee Candle Company claims to sell the \u201cWorld\u2019s Best Loved Candle\u201d and rewards the \u201cWorld\u2019s Best Loved Employees.\u201d With a global presence, company leaders didn\u2019t just want to mail out recognition gifts to top performers, which seems so impersonal. All managers are equipped with a \u201cbest loved employees\u201d toolkit that have various denominations of gift cards and other instant rewards to be presented in person for good work.\n    * Mobile gaming factory Scopely recognizes major contributions from team members weekly with a trophy, social media shout-out and a coveted preferred parking space. Work anniversaries are huge there \u2013 employees get gifts like custom made samurai swords and one-of-a-kind oil paintings. Two Rivers Marketing takes a more cost-effective approach with a personal caricature of the employee on their first anniversary. Using the first anniversary to recognize someone shows them \u201cwe\u2019re glad you\u2019re here.\u201d\n    * New Belgium Brewing, which began with the owner\u2019s inspiration from a trip to Belgium, rewards each employee on their 5-year anniversary with a trip to Belgium. That\u2019s a vacation and appreciation of company culture rolled into one.\n    * Your company can also create an online wish list for employees to fill out, and when someone goes above and beyond, the company buys them something from the list. Whether it\u2019s an espresso maker or custom car mats, the message screams \u201cWe are better because of your good work, so here\u2019s something that will make you happy.\u201d\n\n![Andrea Rich, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Andrea\nRich, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Andrea\nRich, HR Expert Contributor](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/andrearichbio-150x150.jpeg)\n\n[Andrea Rich, HR Expert Contributor](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/arich/)\n\nAndrea Rich is a writer and editor who spent the first 27 years of her career\nin the news business in Colorado, New Mexico and Pennsylvania.\n\n[![Coronavirus & Influenza: Obligations Under FMLA, ADA, Title VII &\nMore:](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Coronavirus\n& Influenza: Obligations Under FMLA, ADA, Title VII &\nMore:](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/HRM-coronavirus-\nwebinar-1.png)](https://www.learningpremier.com/product/coronavirus-influenza-\nobligations-under-fmla-ada-title-vii-\nmore/?utm_source=hrmorning&utm_medium=display&utm_content=8170&utm_campaign=coronavirus-03-31-2020)\n\n#### Keep Up To Date with the Latest HR News\n\nWith HRMorning arriving in your inbox, you will never miss critical stories on\nlabor laws, benefits, retention and onboarding strategies.\n\nSign up for a free HRMorning membership and get our newsletter!\n\n    * Email*\n\n    * username*\n\n    * formOffer\n\n    * businessUnit\n\n    * businessUnitId\n\n    * brand\n\n    * brandId\n\n    * event*\n\n    * controlCode\n\n    * Comments\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.\n\n[ ![HR Morning\nLogo](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![HR\nMorning Logo](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/themes/genesis/assets/images/logo-white@2x.png) ]()\n\n    * [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/HRMorning)\n    * [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/HRMorning)\n    * [Linked In ](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4898679/)\n\n    * [ABOUT HRMORNING](https://www.hrmorning.com/about/)\n    * [ADVERTISE WITH US](https://www.hrmorning.com/advertise-with-us/)\n    * [WRITE FOR US](https://www.hrmorning.com/write-for-hr-morning/)\n    * [CONTACT](https://www.hrmorning.com/contact/)\n\n    * [Employment Law](/pbp-categories/employment-law/)\n    * [Benefits](/pbp-categories/benefits/)\n    * [Recruiting](/pbp-categories/recruiting/)\n    * [Talent Management](/pbp-categories/talent-management/)\n    * [HR Technology](/pbp-categories/hr-technology/)\n    * [Performance Management](/pbp-categories/performance-management/)\n    * [Leadership & Strategy](/pbp-categories/leadership-strategy/)\n    * [Compensation & Payroll](/pbp-categories/compensation-payroll)\n    * [Policy & Culture](/pbp-categories/policy-culture/)\n    * [Staff Administration](/pbp-categories/staff-administration/)\n    * [Wellness & Safety](/pbp-categories/wellness-safety/)\n    * [Staff Departure](/pbp-categories/staff-departure/)\n    * [Employee Services](/pbp-categories/employee-services/)\n    * [Work Location](/pbp-categories/work-location/)\n    * [HR Career & Self-Care](/pbp-categories/hr-career/)\n\nHRMorning, part of the Catalyst Media Network, provides the latest HR and\nemployment law news for HR professionals in the trenches of small-to-medium-\nsized businesses.

Doing so goes a long way to ensuring business growth and success.\n\nFor some, that translates to a new technology or a new strategy surrounding a\ntechnology the workforce is using.  While that's true, it is but a piece of a\nmuch larger puzzle.  The same can be said about the relationship between the\nemployee and employer and any number of strategies that could be mentioned.\n\nIn reality, what HR is looking for is an employee engagement strategy that\ndelivers the best results possible.\n\n# Employee Engagement in 2020\n\nThe hardest part for HR to achieve in defining and implementing an employee\nengagement strategy is trying to find that emotional \"glue\" that connects the\nemployee to the company. The problem is it's a different type of \"glue\" for\nevery organization and every person in the organization.  What connects one\nperson to the company and motivates that person to do their best may not be\nthe same \"glue\" for a co-worker.\n\nAdditionally, events happening all over the world have some bearing on the\nstrategy as well.\n\nEmployee engagement itself isn't a \"check-box\" item HR can simply say it's\ndone because they've completed a series of objections.  It changes constantly\nand HR has to change with it.\n\n## Stats to Know\n\nThe strategy isn't the only thing that's changing.  So too is the data\nsurrounding employee engagement.  Some of the larger points to consider\ninclude:\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/employee_engagement_in_2020_statistics.jpg)\n\n## Employee Engagement Strategies\n\nIt's not enough to know the information and data presented above.  HR has to\ntake action.  Below are a series of strategies to consider when looking to\nbetter the employee engagement strategy at any given company.  As with the\ntopic itself, these strategies are not applicable in all organizations or\nindustries.\n\n### Employees First\n\n> \"Clients do not come first.  Employees come first.  If you take care of your\n> employees, they will take care of the clients.\"\n\nNo doubt that is a familiar phrase.  It was said by Sir Richard Branson, the\nowner of the Virgin Group.  It can be a hard pill to swallow for most, but\nfrom an employee engagement perspective it is very true.\n\nThink about it for a moment.\n\nEvery business is focused on making sure their clients are satisfied, not only\nwith the customer service, but the product as well.  That gets increasingly\nmore difficult if your employees aren't connected to the company and the\nproduct.  If the employees aren't giving their best, what makes the leaders\nthink they are going to do their best in selling the product or be brand\nambassadors for the business?  A few years ago, that might have been the case,\nbut as more and more millennials enter the workforce, not to mention\nGeneration Z, that's changed.  Pay isn't as important as it once was.\n\nEngaging with employees becomes significantly important here.  That engagement\ncan take the form of employee development that supports growth.  It can also\ntake the form of feedback.  Listening to employees can serve a company well.\nNot only does it allow for the discovery of potential problems, but it allows\na company the ability to gain insight from employees about how to better the\nproduct, business process, or overall communication to name a few.\n\n### Recognition\n\n> \"Everyone wants to be appreciated, so if you appreciate someone, don't keep\n> it a secret.\"\n\nThat was uttered by Mary Kay Ash, the founder of Mary Kay Cosmetics.  It's\nsimple, but recognition, especially of an employee by a manager/leader, goes a\nlong way.\n\nThis plays into the need of the employee to know the organization is paying\nattention and investing in them. It also does a lot in the way of motivating\nemployees.  A strong and trusted rewards and recognition program creates one\nof the reason employees need to succeed.  When employees succeed, so too does\nthe company.\n\nRELATED:  [Parkland CXO Talks Rewards\nTechnology](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-tech/articles/parkland-cxo-\ntalks-rewards-technology)\n\n### Work-Life Balance\n\nEvery HR professional has experienced a tightening of the budget in their\ncareers.  That usually means HR teams are unable to put funds toward\npurchasing the latest technology or tools to help better the employee\nengagement strategy.\n\nBut is there a cost-friendly way to go about it?  Yes.\n\nThis is where flexibility comes into the mix.  It's been on the minds of HR\nprofessionals for some time, but only within the last few years has it started\nto become a fully-realized strategy.  Among millennials and Generation Z\nworkers, flexibility is the main driver behind finding the [work-life\nbalance](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/news/12-work-\nlife-balance-tips) so many seek.\n\nThe data supports that claim.\n\n75% of workers, according to FlexJob, say they are more productive at home.\nThere are fewer distractions, less stress as it relates to traveling to and\nfrom work, and the avoidance of office politics.\n\n### Diversity & Inclusion\n\nAt first glance, it may be difficult to see how [diversity and\ninclusion](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/articles/what-diversity-looks-like-in-the-workplace) fits in to the\nlarger employee engagement strategy.  Naturally, it feels like more of a\nrecruitment/talent acquisition strategy than an engagement strategy.\n\nWhile that may have been the case years ago, it's not now especially as more\nand more workers are looking to their employer to be more socially conscious.\nTake [Generation Z](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/articles/rise-of-generation-z-what-hr-should-know) for instance.\nAccording to Allegis Group, 82% of Generation Z workers consider an\norganization's corporate social responsibility, or CSR, a major factor when\ndeciding where to work.  Furthermore, 66% would take a pay cut to work for a\nmore socially responsible company.  In other words:  if the organization is\nnot embracing diversity and inclusion, it can lead to a disconnect between\nemployees and potential job candidates and the company.\n\nAdditionally, a diverse and inclusive workforce has major benefits to an\norganization.  It allows for employees to bring different ideas and solution\nto the table.  All of these are informed by their backgrounds and other\ndimensions of diversity.  This feedback is critical especially when measuring\nthe impact of engagement across the board.\n\n### Wellness\n\n[Wellness](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-compensation-\nbenefits/articles/how-to-maximize-the-value-of-wellness-incentive-pr) is\nsomething that will be huge in the next year and it will become a great\nengagement tool.\n\nAdults spend a lot of their waking time at work.  It makes sense that if a\nperson is healthy in all aspects their ability to work is far improved and the\ncompany benefits.  Health has a direct correlation with employee productivity\nand performance levels.  In fact, a Global Corporate Challenge study says\nhappier employees are more productive at work.\n\n#### Mental Health\n\nIn addition to wellness, mental health will continue to be a high priority for\nHR professionals in 2020.  It can have a major impact on the employee\nengagement strategy within an organization.\n\nPoor mental health causes a loss of 70 million working days every year\naccording to PMLiVE.  Additionally, there are a number of surveys and case\nstudies available showing the negative impact of mental illness on an\norganization and their continued ability to engage employees.\n\nAs companies start and continue to embrace mental health initiatives in the\nworkplace, employees will be increasingly connected to the company and each\nother.\n\n## In Summation\n\nThere any number of strategies that have a positive impact on employee\nengagement within a company.  At the end of the day, the focus is really on\nmaking sure the employee feels supported by the organization.  When the\nemployee feels connected and supported, there will be increases in her/his\nproductivity and the company will feel the impact.  But it's more than just a\nfinancial impact.  Companies who embrace employee engagement will see lower\nturnover rates and will see the creation of more \"forever employees\".  No\nmatter how HR looks at it, employee engagement is a win-win for the\norganization, one that requires a lot of continuous work.  The pay-off is\nworth it in the end.\n\n\n\n> NEXT:  [Future of Work - The Definitive\n> Guide](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/articles/the-\n> definitive-guide-to-the-future-of-work)\n\n\n\n_Photo courtesy:   Pexels_\n\n##  Upcoming Events  __\n\n[\n\n##### Future HR week\n\n](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/events-\nhrtransformationasia/?mac=HRIQ_ArticleDetail_EOI_Title_Listing&utm_medium=Portal&utm_source=hr-\nexchange-network)\n\n27 -

To overcome these challenges\nand improve their programmes, almost three quarters of HR employees surveyed\nsaid they would be likely to invest in recognition and reward within the next\nyear.\n\nAnother barrier to successful recognition programmes is that managers are ill-\nequipped to give effective recognition. Only 16% of managers strongly agreed\nthat their company provides them with the tools and understanding on how to\nrecognise their colleagues effectively.\n\nFinally, many managers are failing to recognise their employees effectively,\nas just 20% of managers strongly agreed that their company praises or thanks\nemployees for the good work they do based on their company\u2019s values, and over\na quarter agreed that they struggle to find the time to give out thanks and\npraise.\n\n####  Commenting on the research, Doug Butler, CEO at Reward Gateway said:\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s great to see so many HR leaders understanding the positive impact\nof employee engagement on business, traditional methods and manual processes\nto achieve current workforce employee engagement goals are no longer an\noption. What employees want is continuous, instant and impactful recognition\nwhich reflects the \u2018always-on\u2019 workplace culture and the \u201calways connected\u201d\npersonal life many now have.\n\n\u201cTo address the employee engagement challenges companies are facing worldwide,\nReward Gateway continues to innovate a timely, visible, and social recognition\nsolution that shines a spotlight on employees, reinforces the mission, purpose\nand values of their company and delivers valuable recognition and rewards that\nemployees appreciate.\u201d\n\nFor further information, please visit [www.rewardgateway.com/uk/blog/the-\nimpact-of-employee-recognition](https://www.rewardgateway.com/uk/blog/the-\nimpact-of-employee-recognition)\n\nRelated company:\n\n![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/RewardGateway2.jpg)\n\nEnhanced[Reward Gateway](/directory/recruiter-suppliers/reward-gateway)[View\nprofile](/directory/recruiter-suppliers/reward-gateway)\n\nKeep up to date with industry news\n\nReceive our daily news straight to your inbox\n\n## Related News\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/photo-1504805572947-34fad45aed93_edit.jpg?itok=H2gKA1go)](/news/statistics/modern-workers-expect-timely-fair-and-consistent-recognition-to-be-motivated-and)\n\n    * 05 Aug 2019\n|\n\n    * [Statistics](/category/events/news-2)\n\n### [Modern workers expect timely, fair, and consistent recognition to be\nmotivated and engaged at work](/news/statistics/modern-workers-expect-timely-\nfair-and-consistent-recognition-to-be-motivated-and)\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/default_images/onrec-news-placeholder.jpg?itok=qSfgtvZz)](/news/news-archive/technology-key-to-increasing-employee-engagement-according-to-hr-professionals-0)\n\n    * 02 Apr 2019\n|\n\n    * [News archive](/category/events/news-5)\n\n### [Technology key to increasing employee engagement, according to HR\nprofessionals](/news/news-archive/technology-key-to-increasing-employee-\nengagement-according-to-hr-professionals-0)\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n  * [News](/news/all)\n  * [Directory](/directory/overview)\n  * [Pricing plans](/directory/price-plan)\n  * [Advertise](/advertise)\n  * [The Onrec Awards](/awards-categories)\n\n## Stay in touch\n\n  * [Twitter __](https://twitter.com/onrec)\n  * [Onrec LinkedIn Forum __](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=78676)\n  * [Contact us](/contact-us)\n\nOnrec\n\nOnrec is for HR Directors, Personnel Managers, Job Boards and Recruiters\nproviding them with information on the Internet recruitment industry such as\nindustry news, directory and events.\n\nE-mail:\n\n[info@onrec.com](mailto:info@onrec.com)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 ONREC.

He led the technology functions of Ingersoll Rand, Allied Signal,\nTelstra, and IBM. At Suncorp, he rose above the role, beginning his tenure\nthere as CIO, rising to the role of Chief Executive Officer of Suncorp\nBusiness Services. He assumed that role during the last financial crisis.\nSmith believes part of the reason for his ascent was his appreciation of\nculture, noting, \u201cProduct, strategy and other elements can be copied, but\nculture is hard.\u201d He also believes that the problem solving nature of the CIO\nrole is can create opportunities. \u201cAs a CIO, a key skillset that you learn is\nhow to problem solve. Learning this skill helped me a great deal for my future\nroles,\u201d Smith notes.\n\nAlthough our interview took place prior to the current economic downturn,\nSmith\u2019s rationale for how he helped Suncorp through the last crisis will be\nimportant as he plots the same recovery in his current role as Chief Operating\nOfficer of World Fuel Services, a $40 billion company that provides marketing,\nfinancing, aviation, marine, and ground transportation fuel products and\nservices.\n\nSmith notes that building a better ecosystem, enabled through digital\ntransformation, exposing application programming interfaces (APIs) for other\ncompanies to better interact with World Fuel Services, has set the company on\na better footing. In this interview, Smith offers both \u201cin the weeds\u201d details\nof the digital transformation that he has led together with big picture\nlessons from building great teams, partnerships, and a great culture.\n\nToday In: [CIO Network](https://www.forbes.com/cio-network)\n\n  * [\n\n### Unprecedented?

Could you talk about your purview as\nCOO?\n\n**Jeff Smith:** In terms of operations, we are global. A good chunk of what I\ndo is related to technology because technology has a place from the initial\ncustomer experience, order to cash, procure to pay and record to report. The\npeople, process and technology strategy plays a big piece, and I also have\nresponsibility for the overall financial operations and shared services for\nhow we support our line of business segments when they conduct their business.\nThis involves running the back-office functions more efficiently in the right\nlocations with the right skills. It is the engine that enables us to go out\nand attract business and execute it efficiently.\n\n**High:** Can you talk about the form that digital transformation takes in an\norganization such as yours?\n\n**Smith:** It is quite pervasive because the digital transformation involves\neverything from the CRM systems, the data systems that allow you to ingest\ncustomer and supplier information, portal strategies and self-service.\nFurther, because much of our supply base is third party, it is creating APIs\nand more of an ecosystem to allow different participants to play without\nhaving to make it so complex, build point-to-point integrations or do it\nmanually. That is one piece of the digital transformation.\n\nOn the other hand, it is around efficiency and using robotics, optical\ncharacter recognition and different technologies so that we can hopefully\nbring in every piece of data digitally, process it digitally, analyze it\ndigitally and make more sense out of all the data that we are collecting to\nmake better business decisions. That can be in pricing, and we buy an awful\nlot. We buy and sell $40 billion worth of energy in one way, shape or form. If\nwe take that data and apply some artificial intelligence and machine learning,\ncan we improve our operating margins and improve the experience back to the\ncustomer? It entails everything from the beginning all the way back to how we\nclose the books and do our analytics on the back-end.\n\n**High:** When you joined the organization, how much change was necessary to\nrealize the vision you just described?\n\n**Smith:** There is one aspect I learned through war wounds in my past roles.\nYour strategy and tactics have to manage the talents that you have on the\npitch. If you want to move to the cloud aggressively and use AI and digital\ntechnologies, you have to have the skills to do that. A good chunk of my first\nyear was taking a look from the bottom up, determining the core skills that we\nneeded, how those rolled up in the roles and how we could create an agile\norganization. We did something quite different than what I experienced in my\nlast few jobs. Rather than doing an org strategy top-down, this was about\ngoing from the bottom up. This entails looking at what work needs to be done,\nfinding what skills are needed to do that well and applying more of a Spotify\nmodel of grouping people into small self-directed teams that are loosely\ncoupled yet tightly aligned into tribes and tribes into a domain. This allows\nyou to run a leaner management structure with fewer levels. However, in order\nto do that, you must have the talent to bring that in.\n\nWe went on a strong assessment training, and we brought in new skills. Over\nthe past two years, we have turned over roughly one-third of our workforce. We\nneeded that amount of replenishment to bring the skill base up because there\nis no compression algorithm for experience. We needed to bring people in so\nthat people could learn at an accelerated pace, and we needed to pick the\nright partners. Another key strategy of being ready is that you are only as\ngood as the people you surround yourself with. I have a principle that states\nthat we pick our partners around the company first and the products second\nbecause the company is your leading indicator and the product and the features\nare the lagging indicators. The first year entailed a great deal of effort\naround who we needed at the executive level, the type of practitioners we\nneeded, and the type of special skills, analytics, digital and cloud\ninfrastructure necessary. We needed to replenish to the point that we could\nexecute the strategy that we wanted to.\n\n**High:** As you thought about the people who were the source of these\nreplenishments, how important was experience in the type of work that you\nforesaw as important or more or less important than experience in the\nindustry?\n\n**Smith:** You need experience in the industry, which we had a decent amount\nof, but when it comes to technologies and how to solve problems in different\nways, you need a mesh. In any great organization, you need diversity of\nthought in addition to diversity of gender and race. My experiences tell me\nthat **** attitude is more important than aptitudes, so you need to create the\nright culture. People have a much larger capacity to learn than they give\nthemselves credit for. You have to have the right people to create the right\nenvironment and then set high expectations. The better people will come up to\nspeed more quickly, so you have to have enough congestion of talent and\nleadership just to enable that learning to happen.\n\n**High:** You talked about the need to build a better set of partners. What\nchanges did you make from that perspective?\n\n**Smith:** On the partner side, we had a few business objectives, which I\nbelieve would serve as strong advice for CIOs who want to take on other\nbroader business roles. It is important to look at it in terms of the business\nobjective and the business outcome you want to get. One of the actions we\nneeded to take to connect people across the world in a more effective way was\nto create a strong, productive environment for them so that they could\ncollaborate and learn from each other at a faster pace. We looked to find the\nbest companies in collaboration, and we were going to make hard turns and get\non those companies. We knew that in addition to the products they sold, we\ncould learn different lessons from them. Three companies we use in our what I\ncall the _employee collaboration environment_ are Box, Zoom, and Slack. We use\nBox for content management, Zoom for video and communications, and Slack for\ncollaboration. These are well run companies, and they run similar management\nsystems with OKRs. All three of those companies have helped us outside of just\nusing their technologies and utilizing them for the problems they have solved.\nWe have looked at their leadership techniques, and all three of them are top-\nrated companies to work for. Further, we looked at Box's engineering\npractices, and we sit on its advisory board.\n\nOne of our other key principles is that both parties should benefit outside of\nthe commercial relationship. We had a huge goal to close down our data centers\nand migrate everything to the cloud. We partnered with AWS, and they even\nhelped us recruit at universities. Those four partners have allowed us to get\nmeasurably better at a faster pace. We are relying on good skills internally,\nhiring what is needed, and partnering with the people that are measurably\nbetter than the ones we were replacing.\n\n**High:** Your business is based in Miami, Florida, and you have operations\nall over the place. Can you talk about recruiting to Miami as well as some of\nthese other areas of strategic importance to you? What methods have you used\nto attract the talent you have described as a key to the changes you have been\nspeaking about?\n\n**Smith:** It is difficult because there are two key attributes you have to\nlook for.\n\n1) The job content, which people are immensely interested in, has to be rich\nenough so they can learn and step in.\n\n2) The talent they are going to be surrounded by.\n\nFurther, you have to have the right location so that people are interested in\ngoing there, and you have to pitch the environment. For Miami, we pitch that\nit is a nice environment, there is no state tax, and it has good logistics for\ntraveling globally with international airports. We are moving everything to\nthe cloud and are an agile culture, both of which we use in our pitch. We try\nto sell more of the job content and the environment than the business itself\nbecause we find that is the driver behind the people that are interested in\nmoving. We additionally have a large operation in Costa Rica that has both\ntechnology and back-office operations, and we have locations in London,\nSingapore and other areas around the world. More than anything, in a low\nunemployment environment, people have to be attracted by the job content and\nwho they are going to be around internally and externally.\n\nOur partners have certainly helped with this. As I mentioned, we have had\nrecruiting events at universities that AWS has attended with us. The company\nhas helped us with machine learning and autonomous vehicle races to show the\ntype of work we are doing. Slack has hosted us in New York, and we have done\nthis in Budapest and London. You have to be creative, and in some cases, you\nhave to go to where the talent is and not just use recruiters. We looked at\nthe Northeast as a good place for people that might be interested in moving to\nMiami because of cost and income tax benefits as well as nice weather and\ngreat jobs. It is multifaceted, and it is tough for everyone. If you talk to\nthe tech companies in the West Coast, New York or Austin, it is just as tough\nfor them as well.\n\n**High:** You have been the Chief Information Officer at a variety of major\norganizations, such as Ingersoll Rand, AlliedSignal, Telstra, Suncorp and IBM.\nAt Suncorp, you went from CIO to Chief Executive Officer of Suncorp Business\nServices, a shared services arm of the Australian organization. You are now\nthe COO of a $40 billion energy organization. What was it about your time as a\nCIO that enabled you to rise in a couple of different instances to broader\nsets of responsibilities?\n\n**Smith:** One is the focus on talent. I have gone into different companies\nthat in one way, shape or form needed to make forklift improvements. When you\nare put in tough situations, it forces you to become a better problem solver\nbecause you have to diagnose a big problem, break it into small problems, and\nmulti-process that problem through different teams. At Suncorp, I was the CIO\nwhen the financial crisis hit, and we could not get wholesale funding. When we\nhad these falling off the cliff moments, outside of the technology skills, the\ngreatest skills any leader can have is to bring clarity of purpose to their\nteams and inspire them to do work and solve the problem in a different way or\nmultitude of ways. Your frame of reference has to expand from \u201cTechnology is\ngoing to solve it all\u201d to \"If I get some great people in some smaller teams\nand break this big problem down, I can multi-process it and get it done at a\nfaster pace.\" You then realize that those skills are just as pertinent,\nwhether you are running procurement, finance, HR, or customer service\norganizations. The reality is that culture is the only unique aspect that any\ncompany has. Product, strategy and other elements can be copied, but culture\nis hard. As a CIO, a key skillset that you learn is how to problem solve.\nLearning this skill helped me a great deal for my future roles.\n\n**High:** As you look to the future, what trends particularly excite you?\n\n**Smith:** A great deal of the innovation in new technologies and solutions\nare only natively on the cloud, so your business has to be cloud-native. The\nhybrid cloud is just a transition to get to the ultimate state because the\ninnovation is not being done on-prem. It is absolutely with the cloud players,\nparticularly AWS and Microsoft. We are making an aggressive push to close all\n21 of our data centers, we have closed 10 to date in just over a year, and we\nhave migrated hundreds of applications. You can help lower your costs, you can\nget better performance, you can get data security **** in terms of encrypting\nyour data, and you can build your skills at the same time. It helps your\nemployees, your customers and your business. That is the footprint in order to\ntake advantage of AI, machine learning, and robotics. We are doing an awful\nlot on robotics and machine learning. The skill of machine learning and\napplying it to the right data in the right business problem is going to\nprovide the biggest benefits in the future. Most people have just not used\ntheir data as an asset. It is a necessary evil to conduct your business as\nopposed to your real assets. If companies can understand their analysis and\ndigital skills in that space to be a domain specialist and be able to analyze\ndata and build algorithms and models that can make their business perform\nbetter, they can differentiate themselves in the market.\n\n_Peter High  is President of _ [ _Metis\nStrategy_](http://www.metisstrategy.com/ \"http://www.metisstrategy.com/\")   _,\na  business and IT advisory firm.

clamoring for consumer-grade tech experiences at\nwork that also help them feel connected to their colleagues and organization.\n\nBy: [Andrew R. McIlvaine](https://hrexecutive.com/author/andrew-r-mcilvaine/\n\"Posts by Andrew R. McIlvaine\") | January 2, 2020 \u2022 6 min read\n\nTopics: [Employee\nRecognition](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/employee-\nrecognition/) |\n[Engagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/engagement/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) |\n[Recognition](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/recognition/)\n| [Retention](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/retention/) |\n[Talent Management](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hpb/hpb-top-stories/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Talent-Board-\nart-700x450.jpg)\n\nEmployee experience has a number of dimensions, all of which employers need to\npay attention to.\n\nThe words \"employee experience\" have become the hottest buzzword in HR these\ndays, and for good reason, says Josh Bersin.\n\n\"We're not building software for HR anymore\u2014we're building it for employees,\"\nthe global industry analyst said during his opening keynote at this year's [HR\nTechnology Conference](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/select-\nhr-tech-conference-news/) in Las Vegas. \"If employees don't find it useful, if\nit doesn't fit into 'the flow of work,' then it's not going to be used.\"\n\nA recent survey from Gartner of 5,000 employees finds that 56% agree with this\nstatement: \"I expect to have the same quality experience at work as I do as a\ncustomer.\"\n\nCompanies are shifting their focus to addressing the full employee experience,\ncognizant that they have the same wants, needs and desires as customers, says\nLauren Mason, principal in Mercer's career business.\n\n\"Companies that figure out how to make their employees' experience as\ndelightful as their customers' experience will have a competitive advantage,\"\nshe says.\n\nEmployee experience isn't just about providing a consumer-grade experience\nwith HR technology, says Bersin. It's also about ensuring that in today's\noften-fragmented organizations, employees feel connected to their work and\ntheir colleagues, understand the organization's mission and their place in it\nand can easily find the information they need for tasks ranging from making\nbenefits choices to furthering their development.\n\nThis has given rise to what he labels \"employee experience platforms.\"\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n**Related** : [This is why you have to take employee experience\nseriously](https://hrexecutive.com/this-is-why-you-have-to-take-employee-\nexperience-seriously/)\n\n\u201cVendors like ServiceNow, Deloitte, Mercer, SAP SuccessFactors, IBM, all have\nplatforms focused on the employee experience,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect out-\nof-the box ERP to do this. This is going to be a significant market.\"\n\nAlthough organizations tend to prefer a single HCM system of record, it's\ndifficult to keep all of that data in one place, Bersin wrote in a report\nearlier this year. \"This means we need a set of software to deliver a single\nuser interface; something that lets us build employee journeys, develop apps,\ncreate and monitor workflows, and add chatbots and other forms of\nconversational interfaces to the mix.\"\n\n**Pulling Together Information**\n\nMany so-called employee experience platforms are designed to help employees\nmore easily find information and complete tasks that they'd otherwise have to\nturn to an HR representative or service center for assistance with.\n\n\"We see organizations wanting to provide an experience where employees can\naddress problems themselves or deal with a major life event without having to\nreach out to someone for help,\" says Bill Docherty, managing director in\ncharge of Deloitte's ConnectMe platform.\n\n\"The real genesis is the recognition that employees today are digital\nconsumers,\" he says. \"The bring that same expectation to the workplace.\"\n\nConnectMe is a digital employee experience platform for service delivery, says\nDocherty. \"Our clients use it for communicating major events, such as a\ntransformation the organization is undergoing. It's also used to help\nemployees address major life events, such as getting married or going on a\nleave of absence.\"\n\nMajor HCM platforms such as those offered by ADP and Workday are good at\ntransactional services but not so good at helping employees quickly find\nrelevant information that requires interaction with multiple systems, he says.\nConnectMe is designed to serve as an interface between different systems to\nprovide a more user-friendly experience, says Docherty.\n\nServiceNow, a large vendor with over 10,000 employees, started off in IT\nservice delivery and expanded into HR service delivery four years ago. It uses\nnatural language processing to power a virtual agent that enables \"an\nomnichannel experience for the employee,\" says Blake McConnell, senior vice\npresident of employee workflows.\n\nDeepak Bharadwaj, vice president of ServiceNow's HR Business Unit, joined the\ncompany four years ago from Taleo.\n\n\"The charter I was given was how to take our platform and make it valuable and\nrelevant to HR,\" he says. \"The surge of interest in 'employee experience' over\nthe last five years meshes nicely with the things we're able to help clients\nwith.\"\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nServiceNow's platform is designed to make it easy for employees and managers\nquickly find needed information, says Bharadwaj. \"When you're confronted with\na situation like jury duty or there's a paycheck error or you've got a new\nhire to bring on, you're often lost as to what to do,\" he says. \"Our aim is to\nguide them through what could be fairly complex processes, ensure they have\naccess to the right information and proactively give them information before\nthey even ask for it.\"\n\n**Big \"E\" Versus Small \"e\"**\n\nWhen it comes to employee experience, Chris Pinc says, there's a difference\nbetween \"small 'e'\" employee experience and \"big 'e' \" employee experience.\n\nSmall 'e' refers to the consumer-grade experience employees tend to expect now\nwith workplace technology, he says. However, the big 'E' is what's really\nimportant.\n\n\"That's much more about whether employees feel their experience is\ninspirational to them: Are they inspired by their organization, do they feel\nlike it's winning in the marketplace?\" says Pinc, managing director of product\nmanagement at Willis Towers Watson's talent reward business. \"If you can\ndeliver that big E experience, that's what really drives the bottom line.\"\n\nA positive big E experience is more directly correlated to better customer\nservice, improved sales and top-line revenue growth and reduced costs, he\nsays. It's much more than, say, just providing a good experience via a smooth\npayroll transaction, he adds.\n\n\"Big E describes things like opportunities to grow and reach your full\npotential, to make decisions and innovate and to be part of a winning team,\"\nsays Pinc. \"But if you merely describe employee experience from a\ntransactional viewpoint, then all you're doing is just using a buzzword to\njump on the bandwagon.\"\n\nHR, not IT or finance, is the best \"owner\" for driving and improving Big E\nexperience, he says. \"HR's in the best position to do two things: one,\nunderstand what employees care about and what they want from work, and two,\nunderstand how the organization can improve those moments that matter.\"\n\nIf you don't have both sides of that equation, says Pinc, then you won't be\nsuccessful in improving the \"big E\" experience.\n\nWillis Towers Watson offers an employee experience platform that's focused\nprimarily on the communication side of things, he says.\n\n\"Ours is focused on driving the right behaviors within an organization and\ncommunicating in a personalized way to employees,\" says Pinc.\n\nClients can use the platform to create and deliver \"rich content,\" including\nimages and videos, that's branded to their company, he says. WTW's employee-\nsurvey capabilities are considered part of the platform as well.\n\n**Related:** [The 6 key elements of employee\nexperience](https://hrexecutive.com/the-6-key-elements-of-employee-\nexperience/)\n\n\"In order to deliver the right messages to employees, you first need to\nunderstand what it is that employees care about,\" says Pinc. \"It's integration\nbetween feedback and listening on one hand and communicating and nudging on\nthe other.\"\n\nClients use the platform to help guide employees through a merger, find new\ncareers or develop skills in their current one and learn more about the\ncompany's benefits offerings, he says.\n\nThey also use it to help employees understand their role in helping the\norganization move forward.\n\n\"You need to be crystal clear to employees on how what they do contributes to\nthe big picture while giving them the freedom to help drive that\ntransformation,\" says Pinc.\n\nOne healthcare system client uses the platform to deliver personalized\nmessages to employees based on their roles. Cleaning staff, for example, will\nsee regular reminders of how their job helps prevent patient infections by\nkeeping hospital rooms clean.\n\n\"It's the first thing they see when they log in in the morning and it\nreinforces to them the critical role they play in making a difference in\npatients' lives,\" he says.\n\n**Driving Change**\n\nA poor onboarding experience or a merger/acquisition can undermine employee\nexperience, says Keith Kitani, CEO and co-founder of GuideSpark.\n\n\"Mergers and acquisitions are kind of like a huge onboarding task,\" he says.\n\"Sure, there's some process, but a lot of it is alignment around culture,\nstrategy, organization and rewards. 83% of mergers fail, and half of them do\nso because of people-related issues.\"\n\nGuideSpark's platform lets companies create sustained employee-communication\nstrategies that can help HR leaders boost engagement during an M&A or support\na major new process, such as a revamped performance-management process, says\nKitani.\n\nKitani, who started a tech firm that was eventually acquired by Adobe Systems\nand is now called Adobe Connect, launched GuideSpark in 2008 to help companies\ncreate video and mobile versions of their print communications.\n\n\"Eventually we realized it's not just about creating a great content\nexperience but, how do you actually reach and engage employees in a world\nthat's increasingly noisy?\" he says.\n\nThe result was its GuideSpark Communication Cloud product, which is designed\nto drive change or adoption around key strategic programs via communication.\n\n\"Communication is a challenge for most organizations,\" says Kitani.\n\nOne client, a Fortune 20 company, wanted to overhaul its 20-year old\nperformance management process. Considering that it had 60,000 employees\nscattered around the globe, this would be no easy task.\n\n\"They realized that they needed to drive adoption throughout the entire\norganization, so they charted out a three-year plan to reach all the different\ngroups within the company,\" he says.\n\nThe company used Communication Cloud to create campaigns with different\nmessages and delivery mechanisms for each group. The campaign included\ninformation on why the new PM system was important and how it worked. The\nmaterial was reinforced and supplemented with short-form content to guide the\nemployees through the process.\n\n\"Changing behavior takes time\u2014it's about measuring and iterating,\" says\nKitani.\n\nOptimal employee experiences can't be created in a vacuum, says Pinc.\n\n\"Everything HR does can be done better with the right technology and by\nlistening to employees,\" he says.\n\nAndrew R. McIlvaine is former senior editor with _Human Resource Executive_ \u00ae.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fthe-\nrise-of-the-employee-experience-platform%2F)\n\n[ __Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+rise+of+the+employee-\nexperience+platform&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fthe-rise-of-the-\nemployee-experience-platform%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fthe-\nrise-of-the-employee-experience-platform%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

modern workforce and improve employee\nengagement up to 37 percent**_\n\nReward Gateway, the [employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/) company, and Josh Bersin, an independent global\nindustry analyst and dean of the Josh Bersin Academy, today launched a new\nreport that covers how businesses can improve performance and results through\nstrategic employee engagement and recognition built for the modern workforce.\nNotably, the research reveals that organizations investing in strategic\nrecognition can increase employee engagement scores up to 37 percent.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834cbfa95ab.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nThe report defines strategic employee engagement and recognition in comparison\nto traditional models, outlines why companies must take a different approach\nto engage the modern workforce and summarizes the key elements of a successful\nstrategic recognition program. Results show that successful strategic employee\nrecognition programs are measurable, integrated with other engagement\ninitiatives, social, timely and transparent. Programs with these elements are\n12 times more likely to generate strong business results, and businesses can\nincrease employee engagement, productivity and customer service by 14 percent.\n\nThe report also features case studies from organizations that achieved\nsignificant business results through strategic recognition plans.\n\n\u201cAs today\u2019s workplace environment becomes increasingly automated, dispersed\nand diverse, employers need to do more to improve employee engagement,\u201d said\nBersin. \u201cStrategic employee engagement and recognition programs, when\ndeveloped properly, are significant drivers of the authentic engagement the\nmodern workforce is expecting. This report is for companies that don\u2019t just\nwant to hear about the importance of strategic recognition, but want to know\nhow to implement a successful program.\u201d\n\n\u201cTraditional recognition programs like tenure awards and bonuses are nice, but\nwhen they are not tied to business objectives are limited in their ability to\nbecome culture drivers, and are unlikely to impact employee engagement,\u201d said\nDoug Butler, CEO at Reward Gateway. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re focused on strategic\nrecognition, communications and measurement aligned with business\u2019 goals and\nvalues. This report reinforces what we have learned from working with over\n1,800 clients, that strategic employee engagement and recognition programs can\nbe successfully implemented and have a positive impact on culture and business\nresults.\u201d\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fnew-research-by-josh-bersin-and-reward-gateway-shows-employee-\nengagement-recognition-influence-overall-business-\nresults%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=New+Research+by+Josh+Bersin+and+Reward+Gateway+Shows+Employee+Engagement+%26+Recognition+Influence+Overall+Business+Results\n\"Share this News on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=New+Research+by+Josh+Bersin+and+Reward+Gateway+Shows+Employee+Engagement+%26+Recognition+Influence+Overall+Business+Results&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fnew-research-by-josh-bersin-and-reward-gateway-shows-employee-\nengagement-recognition-influence-overall-business-\nresults%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this News on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fnew-research-by-josh-bersin-and-reward-gateway-shows-employee-\nengagement-recognition-influence-overall-business-\nresults%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this News on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fnew-research-by-josh-bersin-and-reward-gateway-shows-employee-\nengagement-recognition-influence-overall-business-\nresults%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this News on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-email-\nicon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=New Research by Josh Bersin and Reward Gateway\nShows Employee Engagement & Recognition Influence Overall Business\nResults&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fnew-research-by-josh-bersin-and-reward-gateway-shows-employee-\nengagement-recognition-influence-overall-business-\nresults%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this News via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Employee Engagement ](/category/employee-engagement/\n\"Employee Engagement\")\n\n  * [ ![20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/cover20freshemployeeengagementideasfor2020_5dd4e96253adc.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-engagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-\nengagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nAre your employees tired of the same old employee engagement activities?

can create distinct differences between recognition and\nappreciation while at work.\n\nBy: [Amy Leschke-Kahle](https://hrexecutive.com/author/amy-leschke-kahle/\n\"Posts by Amy Leschke-Kahle\") |

an obvious and common approach to\nboost your employee engagement. While many appreciation and recognition\nefforts are designed to make a real difference for workers, the concepts of\nappreciation and recognition themselves are quite different; one is not better\nthan the other, but they have distinct intents and outcomes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nAppreciation is about the heart. Being appreciative sounds like, \u201cI appreciate\nthe extra hours you worked on that project\u201d or, \u201cI appreciate you being so\nthoughtful.\u201d Appreciation feels like, \u201cI see you, I know you and you are a\nperson I care about.\u201d Here are three key things to consider about [delivering\nappreciation](https://hrexecutive.com/here-are-the-5-steps-to-creating-a-\nculture-of-appreciation/):\n\n  * **You can\u2019t fake appreciation.** Most of us can spot a fake a mile away. Often, coerced appreciation happens but not regularly, such as on an allotted day. It sounds generalized, like it came from a greeting card. For appreciation to be real and more than a check-the-box sentiment, it has to come from the heart.\n  * **Everyone has something worthy of appreciation.** You don\u2019t have to be best friends with someone to appreciate something about them. Sometimes we get stuck in the \u201cthis person drives me crazy\u201d space, and it overwhelms how we experience that person. Take a step back and push that lack of likeability to the side for a moment. Appreciation means a lot to anyone, but it\u2019s extra special when you appreciate something about someone that isn\u2019t quite your best buddy.\n  * **Appreciation means a lot, no matter where it comes from.** Appreciation is honoring the innate humanness of someone. You can appreciate your direct reports, your co-workers or even your boss! Look beyond your team and appreciate someone and make them smile.\n\nAs great as appreciation is\u2014and it is great\u2014it\u2019s not the same as recognition.\nThe outcome from appreciation is to feel goodness. The outcome of recognition\nis engagement. Recognition sounds like, \u201cYou delivered a great presentation\ntoday.\u201d Recognition feels like \u201ca job well done.\u201d Although there is certainly\nan element of \u201cheart\u201d in recognition, it\u2019s more about \u201chead.\u201d Here are three\nkey items when considering recognition:\n\n  * **Recognition is specific.** For recognition to be meaningful, it must be specific. A general statement about work doesn\u2019t cut it. As a recipient of recognition, I need to know that you\u2019re paying enough attention to me that you know what I\u2019m working on.\n  * **The most powerful recognition comes from my team leader.** It\u2019s not that recognition from people other than my team leader is bad; in fact, it\u2019s good. But the biggest impact of recognition comes from the person who is most important to me at work: my boss.\n  * **Recognition is extreme.** Recognizing mediocrity or work that is just OK feels like a forced activity. Meaningful recognition catches people not just doing things right, but doing things that are excellent.\n\nHow do we know those three things about engagement? We know from the research\nthat the most meaningful driver of engagement when it comes to recognition is\nnot \u201cI am recognized for good work,\u201d but \u201cI know I will be recognized for\nexcellent work.\u201d When you pay attention to individual work frequently, people\nwill feel confident that you\u2019ll see them at their best when it happens.\n\n[SUBSCRIBE here to receive our daily emails.](https://hrexecutive.com/home-\npage/subscribe/)\n\nOrganizations continue to confuse appreciation and recognition. Simply,\nappreciation is nice and we should do more of it, where recognition is all\nabout proving how actions speak louder than words\u2014it's attention from the most\nimportant person at work, the leader. Our question should not be whether we\nshould be focusing on recognition _or_ appreciation. Instead, we need to\ncreate an environment of appreciation for each other _and_ recognition for our\ndirect reports. Good companies invest in one or the other. The best companies\ninvest in both.\n\n*\n\nAmy Leschke-Kahle is vice president, performance acceleration, at The Marcus\nBuckingham Company, an ADP Company.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fthe-\nimportance-of-distinguishing-appreciation-from-recognition%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+importance+of+distinguishing+appreciation+from+recognition&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fthe-\nimportance-of-distinguishing-appreciation-from-recognition%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fthe-\nimportance-of-distinguishing-appreciation-from-recognition%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

is\nImportant](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/content_images/recognition_5947ac93dc165.jpg)\n\nHuman nature is such that humans like to feel valued and special for what they\nare and what they do. This basic psychological tenet is applicable in the\nworkplace as well, and forms the basis for rewards and recognition. While some\norganizations prefer paying a premium to make employees feel valued, others\nbelieve in a more culture-centric way of making employees stick. For the\nsecond type of organization, recognition comes as a savior tool. Recognition\nis nothing but appreciation given in a structured manner. Appreciation is\nknown to increase the levels of the feel-good hormone oxytocin, leading to\nhappiness and high spirits, says a research by Bersin by Deloitte. Recognition\nis thus, intricately linked to employee engagement through a positive\ncorrelation.  \n  \nA recognition program does not typically involve much costs, but the outcome\nis significant. Some of the advantages are:\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834dc302698.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n  * Increases the repetition of desired behaviors, thereby aligning people with the desired organizational goals\n  * Better employee job satisfaction\n  * Enhances team spirit\n  * Lowers employee turnover by acting as a retention tool. \n  * Lowers incidences of negative behavior, reduces absenteeism, increases productivity, and decreases stress on the job. \n  * Maintains a strong employer brand\n  * Acts as an allied HR process for meeting learning goals\n\n  \nHR leaders who design recognition programs must keep in mind the intricacies\nof designing an effective and efficient program. Especially with new work\ngroups dominating the workplace (such as millennials), the specific needs of\nthese special groups must be taken into consideration. For example,\nmillennials derive more inspiration from peers, than veterans do, so peer to\npeer may be more effective for them. For veterans, traditional recognition\nsuch as a company announcement may work better. Following are the points to be\nconsidered in the design and deployment of a recognition program:\n\n1\\. Align desired outcomes: First and foremost, it is important to design the\nprogram to extract the desired organizational behaviors. This includes linking\nit with the values of the organization. According to the Globoforce/SHRM\nEmployee Recognition Survey, 2016, 60% of those organizations which have a\nrecognition program have tied it into the core values.\n\n2\\. Select the intervention: The right HR processes must be created to create\nopportunities to shower praise. This can be done by designing a digital\nrecognition portal, as well as a physical offline process. Some of the common\nrecognition modes are thank you cards, pings by the manager, peer to peer\nrecognition, bay announcements, lunch with the boss, special learning\ninterventions, additional time off, etc.\n\n3\\. Review and Revisit: HR leaders must measure program effectiveness on an\nongoing basis, by calculating the ROI in terms of engagement scores, retention\nmetrics, productivity, and other business metrics. They must keep recognition\nfresh and consistent, so as to build a process that employees look forward to.  \n  \nOver and above this, recognition must be timely and be perceived as valuable.  \n  \nRecognition will emerge as a strong employee engagement, development, and\nretention tool of the future. Already, many organizations have adopted it in a\nbig way. The Globoforce/SHRM Employee Recognition Survey, 2016 states that\noverall 81% of organizations have some kind of a recognition program in place.\nIt will only become more popular from here on, as a diverse workforce knows\nthe importance of different ways of being valued by the employer.  \n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Fwhy-employee-recognition-is-\nimportant%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Why+Employee+Recognition+is+Important\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Why+Employee+Recognition+is+Important&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Fwhy-employee-recognition-is-\nimportant%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Fwhy-employee-recognition-is-\nimportant%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Fwhy-employee-recognition-is-\nimportant%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Why Employee Recognition is\nImportant&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-and-\nrecognition%2Fwhy-employee-recognition-is-\nimportant%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Rewards & Recognition ](/category/rewards-and-\nrecognition/ \"Rewards & Recognition\")\n\n  * [ ![How to Retain Top Talent with Employee Recognition: Q&A With Cord Himelstein of Halo Recognition](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/halo_recognition_hr_talk_interview_545_x_240_px_5dc1685b95dbf.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/rewards-and-recognition/cord-himelstein-halo-recognition-top-talent/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How to Retain Top Talent with Employee Recognition: Q&A; With Cord\nHimelstein of Halo Recognition\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/rewards-and-recognition/cord-\nhimelstein-halo-recognition-top-talent/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nCord Himelstein, VP of marketing and communication, Halo Recognition, speaks\nabout how HR needs to approach employee recognition programs and more.\n\nby [Neha Pradhan](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/neha-\npradhan/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Nov 05, 2019\n\n  * [ ![6 Statistics That Confirm Employee Recognition and Retention Are Related](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/statistics_for_employee_recognition_and_retention_5e4e903c0e87c.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-recognition/employee-recognition-and-retention-statistics/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 6 Statistics That Confirm Employee Recognition and Retention Are\nRelated ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-\nrecognition/employee-recognition-and-retention-\nstatistics/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nFor companies looking to strengthen their retention capabilities, an effective\nrecognition program is essential.

It\u2019s a pithy\nstatement made famous by David Hieatt, creator of the DO Lectures. In his\ntalks to entrepreneurs, he says, \"The Time Bank won\u2019t tell you how to spend\nit. Time poorly spent will not be replaced with more time.\u201d Put that into\nperspective. A typical workweek has 120 hours. Given a 40-hour workweek, you\nspend one-third of that time interacting with colleagues. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s\nprobably more time than you spend with your family or loved ones. This reality\nmakes having positive relationships at work extremely important. This could be\nacheived by peer-to-peer recognition and rewards.\n\nMental Health America says when employers prioritize positive relationships at\nwork, they promote a creative, collaborative, and supportive workplace\nculture. On the other hand, if employers allow toxic relationships to\nmanifest, it can increase stress levels and feelings of isolation. The result,\nMental Health America asserts, is a negative impact on employee mental and\nphysical health, which lowers morale and motivation. When peer-to-peer\nrecognition is frequent, visible, and meaningful, it becomes part of an\nemployee\u2019s everyday habits. Imagine sending a colleague a \u201cjob well done!\u201d for\ntheir latest project, welcoming a new team member aboard their first day, or\nshowcasing a peer who went above and beyond - recognition has value at every\nstep of the [employee\nexperience](https://martechseries.com/?s=employee%20experience).\n\n### **Here Are Four Reasons Why Continuous Recognition Should Be the New\nNormal:**\n\n  * **Technology makes it easier:**[Reward Gateway research](https://www.rewardgateway.com/blog/saving-hr-time-with-integrations) found that 82% of HR professionals in the U.S. believe [employee engagement](https://martechseries.com/?s=employee%20engagement) would improve if their people had the technology to recognize their peers for good behavior. An employee engagement app, for example, can integrate into your existing HR technology and mimic the type of [digital experience](https://martechseries.com/?s=digital%20experience) employees get on personal social sharing platforms. Technology enables access and frequency, so peer-to-peer recognition can be done in real time. Recognition and rewards technology also keeps your employees connected to each other, whether they are on the train headed home or at the watercooler catching up with a co-worker.\n  * **Real-time feels more organic:** Employees attach different expectations when recognition is given in a timely manner. Why make employees wait until the employee-of-the-month happy hour to give them kudos? With the right recognition and rewards technology, employees can send, comment, and react to recognition moments in real time (before it\u2019s old news). And they can put the spotlight on these moments, even in between meetings, using e-cards, blog posts, or instant awards.\n  * **Promotes \u201cteam\u201d performance for organizational success:** Programs that allow peer-to-peer recognition and rewards to thrive help to foster trust among teams. According to author Stephen M. R. Covey, trust is essential for unparalleled success and prosperity within a business organization. Giving an \u201cattaboy\u201d to a colleague encourages more collaboration that builds stronger team dynamics over time. And it simply creates the space for more recognizable opportunities to occur and to be acted upon by people who work alongside the employee.\n  * **Managers are busy, give them the tools.** The demand for a manager\u2019s time is usually high, and keeping tabs on every employee\u2019s shining moment can be challenging. In fact, [60%](https://www.rewardgateway.com/press-releases/new-research-reveals-breakdown-between-employees-and-employer-in-recognition-trust-and-communication-of-mission-and-values)[ of workers ](https://www.rewardgateway.com/press-releases/new-research-reveals-breakdown-between-employees-and-employer-in-recognition-trust-and-communication-of-mission-and-values)[feel that their colleagues could be thanked and praised more regularly by managers and leader](https://www.rewardgateway.com/press-releases/new-research-reveals-breakdown-between-employees-and-employer-in-recognition-trust-and-communication-of-mission-and-values)s. Our 2017 study found that [54% of employees](https://www.rewardgateway.com/press-releases/news/the-social-recognition-disconnect) would rather work for a company with a culture where they receive recognition over a higher-salary job where they don\u2019t get any recognition. Managers being available to react and respond when these moments occur is critical because recognition is one of the key drivers needed for employees to become ingrained in a company\u2019s values and corporate mission. When you give managers the tools they need to overcome the barriers, they, too, can be active participants in continuous recognition.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nPeer-to-peer employee recognition and rewards have the power to foster the\ntype of positive workplace relationships that lead employees to have better\njob satisfaction and increased productivity. It is also the foundation for\ncreating a culture of continuous recognition.\n\nWe can\u2019t get time back, but we can give employees a reason to feel like each\nworkday is time well spent. By giving employees and managers the tools to more\neasily give recognition and rewards, we can also actively include employees in\nbuilding positive workplace relationships and more meaningful employee\nexperiences\n\n__[Employee Recognition](https://martechseries.com/tag/employee-\nrecognition/)[Job Satisfaction](https://martechseries.com/tag/job-\nsatisfaction/)[peer-to-peer](https://martechseries.com/tag/peer-to-\npeer/)[Recognition](https://martechseries.com/tag/recognition/)[Rewards](https://martechseries.com/tag/rewards/)[Workplace\nRelationship](https://martechseries.com/tag/workplace-relationship/)\n\n[__**0**](https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/guest-authors/4-reasons-peer-\nto-peer-recognition-rewards-should-be-the-new-normal/#respond \"Leave a comment\non: \u201c4 Reasons Peer-To-Peer Recognition and Rewards Should Be the New\nNormal\u201d\") __**108**\n\n__**Share**\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Fmts-\ninsights%2Fguest-authors%2F4-reasons-peer-to-peer-recognition-rewards-should-\nbe-the-new-normal%2F)[__](https://twitter.com/share?text=4+Reasons+Peer-To-\nPeer+Recognition+and+Rewards+Should+Be+the+New+Normal&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Fmts-\ninsights%2Fguest-authors%2F4-reasons-peer-to-peer-recognition-rewards-should-\nbe-the-new-\nnormal%2F)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmartechseries.com%2Fmts-\ninsights%2Fguest-authors%2F4-reasons-peer-to-peer-recognition-rewards-should-\nbe-the-new-normal%2F&title=4+Reasons+Peer-To-\nPeer+Recognition+and+Rewards+Should+Be+the+New+Normal)\n\n[ ](https://martechseries.com/author/will-tracz/ \"Browse Author Articles\")\n\n[Will Tracz](https://martechseries.com/author/will-tracz/)\n\n__Prev Post\n\n[Lonely Planet Partners with Acquia to develop the Most Consumer-Centric\nPlatform in Travel](https://martechseries.com/content/lonely-planet-partners-\nacquia-develop-consumer-centric-platform-travel/)\n\nNext Post __\n\n[Contentful Unveils Headless CMS Ecommerce Solution for Faster Content\nDelivery and Improved Sales](https://martechseries.com/content/contentful-\nunveils-headless-cms-ecommerce-solution-faster-content-delivery-improved-\nsales/)\n\nYou might also like More from author\n\n[Guest Authors](https://martechseries.com/category/mts-insights/guest-\nauthors/)\n\n[](https://martechseries.com/mts-insights/guest-authors/dear-google-\nsuggestion/ \"Dear Google\u2026I have a Suggestion!\")\n\n[ Dear Google\u2026I have a Suggestion!

This third stimulus bill aims to provide\nrelief and boost the economy via $2 trillion in aid and stimulus money via tax\nbreaks, rebates, small business loans, industry specific aid, and unemployment\nbenefits. Here, we focus on the expansion of two Small Business Administration\n(SBA) loan programs and the tax provisions of the CARES Act as applicable to\nthe construction industry.\n\n#### **The Top 10 Executive Summary**\n\nThe following list and brief explanations cover the Top 10 aspects of the\nCARES Act as it relates to the construction industry. Additional details and\ntakeaways are included following the list:\n\n  1. Expansion of SBA 7(a) Loans - the Paycheck Protection Program - Provides SBA covered loans to businesses with less than 500 employees up to the lesser of 250% of monthly payroll costs or $10 million that may be forgiven to a certain extent (possibly 100%), so long as 75% of the proceeds are used to fund payroll costs. To the extent the PPP loan is not forgiven, the maturity date is two years at an interest rate of 1%. Lenders are required to provide borrowers with complete payment deferment for six months. No collateral or personal guarantee is required, but the borrower must make a series of certifications.\n  2. Independent Contractors and PPP Loans - Independent contractors and self-employed individuals are eligible to apply for PPP loans under the same terms, but applications cannot be submitted until April 10, 2020.\n  3. Expansion of SBA 7(b)(2) Disaster Loans - Disaster Loans are now available for businesses with fewer than 500 employees, sole proprietors, and ESOPs. These working capital loans of up to $2 million come with 3.75% interest rate and max term of 30 years. There is no loan forgiveness, but no personal guarantee is required for loans under $200,000, and they all come with immediate advance (within 3 days) of up to $10,000, which is not required to be repaid even if the request for a disaster loan is denied.\n  4. Employee Retention Credit - Refundable payroll tax credit for 50% of wages paid by eligible employers to certain employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. An employer is not eligible for the employee retention credit if the employer receives a PPP loan or another SBA 7(a) loan.\n  5. Delay of Payment/Deposit of Employer Payroll Taxes - The CARES Act allows for the deferral of the employer's share of the 6.2% Social Security tax that would otherwise be due in 2020 from the date of enactment through December 31, 2020, to be paid on December 31, 2021 (50%) and December 31, 2022 (50%). The deferral does not apply to employers who took out a PPP loan or another SBA 7(a) loan.\n  6. Net Operating Losses - Temporary Carryback Allowance - A temporary five-year carryback period is available for NOLs arising in calendar years 2018, 2019, and 2020, and those NOLs can offset 100% of taxable income until the 2021 tax year.\n  7. Technical Correction for Qualified Improvement Property - A technical correction was made to QIP by retroactively designating QIP as 15-year property (20-year for ADS) for depreciation purposes; thus, QIP is eligible for 100% bonus depreciation if placed in service after December 31, 2017.\n  8. Relaxation of the Limitation on Business Interest - The CARES Act increases the ATI limit from 30% to 50% for 2019 and 2020, and allows a business to elect to use its 2019 ATI when computing its 2020 limitation (since many businesses in 2020 will likely not have taxable income in 2020).\n  9. Individual Recovery Rebates - The new statute provides a $1,200 rebate for single-filers and heads of household and $2,400 for joint filers, along with $500 per qualifying child. Thus, a jointly-filing family of four would get $3,400 before the application of any phase out rules.\n  10. Relaxation of Retirement Plan Restrictions - The CARES Act provides that the 10% penalty does not apply to any \"coronavirus-related distribution\" up to $100,000. The loan amount an individual can borrow against his/her plan also increases from $50,000 to $100,000 for the 180-day period starting after March 27, 2020.\n\n#### **Expansion of SBA 7(a) Loans - the Paycheck Protection Program**\n\nThe CARES Act expands the SBA 7(a) Loan Program to address working capital\nneeds of small to mid-size businesses, including businesses in the\nconstruction industry. This expansion, called the [Paycheck Protection\nProgram](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/paycheck-protection-\nprogram-ppp) (PPP), provides covered loans that will be forgiven to a certain\nextent (possibly 100%), as described below and in the SBA Administrator's\n[Interim Final Rule](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/PPP--\nIFRN%20FINAL.pdf). If the loan is not completely forgiven (perhaps the\nborrower terminated some employees during the covered period, or the proceeds\nwere used for something other than the \"four forgivable uses\"), then the loan\ncontinues with a maturity date of two years, an interest rate of 1%, and\nlenders are required to provide borrowers with complete payment deferment for\na period of six months. Further, no collateral or personal guarantee is\nrequired.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nConstruction-related eligible businesses include (nonprofits have been\nremoved):\n\n  * A small business with fewer than 500 employees;\n  * An individual who operates as a sole proprietor;\n  * An individual who operates as an independent contractor; or\n  * An individual who is self-employed who regularly carries on any trade or business.\n\nThe 500-employee threshold includes all employees - full-time, part-time, and\nany other status, including employees obtained from a temporary employee\nagency, professional employer organization, or leasing concern. The threshold\nincludes employees of affiliates in most instances.\n\nIn addition, the borrower must have been in operation before February 15,\n2020, with employees for whom they paid salaries and payroll taxes or paid\nindependent contractors. Unlike other SBA 7(a) loans, you do not need: (1)\nproof that you sought credit elsewhere, and were unable to obtain it; (2) a\npersonal guarantee for the loan; or (3) collateral for the loan.\n\n## Applying\n\nYou can [apply](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Paycheck-\nProtection-Program-Application-3-30-2020-v3.pdf) for a PPP loan through any\nexisting SBA lender or through any federally insured depository institution\n(bank), federally insured credit union (credit union), and Farm Credit System\ninstitution that is participating. Other regulated lenders may enroll in the\nprogram and will be able to provide PPP loans as well. A list of SBA lenders\nmay be found [here](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans).\n\nSmall businesses and sole proprietorships can start applying for PPP loans on\nApril 3, 2020. Independent contractors and self-employed individuals can start\napplying for PPP loans on April 10, 2020. The application requires a good\nfaith certification that:\n\n  * The uncertainty of current economic conditions makes the loan request necessary to support ongoing operations;\n  * The borrower will use the loan proceeds to retain workers and maintain payroll or make mortgage, lease, and utility payments;\n  * Not more than 25% of the forgiven amount may be for non-payroll costs;\n  * The borrower does not have an application pending for a loan duplicative of the purpose and amounts applied for here; and\n  * From Feb. 15, 2020 to Dec. 31, 2020,theborrowerhasnotreceivedaloanduplicative of the purpose and amounts applied for here. \n    * But, there is an opportunity to fold disaster loans made between January 31, 2020 and April 3 (or 10), 2020, into a new loan.\n\nFor independent contractors, sole proprietors, and self-employed individuals,\nlenders will be looking for certain documents like payroll tax filings, Forms\n1099-MISC, and income and expenses from the sole proprietorship.\n\n## PPP Loan Amount\n\nPPP loan amounts can be up to 2.5 times the borrower's average monthly payroll\ncosts from year prior to loan, not to exceed $10 million. For businesses not\noperational in 2019, loan amounts will be 2.5 times the average total monthly\npayroll costs incurred for January and February 2020.\n\nPayroll costs for employers include:\n\n  * Salary, wage, commission, or similar compensation;\n  * Payment of cash tip or equivalent;\n  * Payment for vacation, parental, family, medical, or sick leave;\n  * Allowance for dismissal or separation;\n  * Payment required for the provisions of group health care benefits, including insurance premiums;\n  * Payment of any retirement benefit; and\n  * Payment of state or local tax assessed on the compensation of the employee.\n\nPayroll costs for sole proprietors, independent contractors, and self-employed\nindividuals include the sum of payments of any compensation to or income of a\nsole proprietor or independent contractor that is a wage, commission, income,\nnet earnings from self-employment, or similar compensation and that is in an\namount that is not more than $100,000 in one year, as pro-rated for the\ncovered period.\n\nPayroll costs do not include:\n\n  * Compensation of an individual employee in excess of an annual salary of $100,000, as prorated for the period of February 15, 2020 through June 30, 2020;\n  * Federal payroll taxes imposed or withheld under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC);\n  * Any compensation of an employee whose principal place of residence is outside of the United States; or\n  * Qualified sick leave wages for which a credit is allowed under section 7001 of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA); or qualified family leave wages for which a credit is allowed under section 7003 of the FFCRA because employers get a corresponding refundable tax credit for making these payments.\n\n## PPP Loan Forgiveness\n\nPPP loans are forgivable to the amount spent by the borrower on the following\nitems during the eight-week period beginning on the date of the origination of\nthe loan (when funds are disbursed):\n\n  * Payroll costs (same definition of payroll costs used to determine PPP loan amount);\n  * Interest on a mortgage obligation incurred in the ordinary course of business (not principal);\n  * Rent on a leasing agreement; and\n  * Payments on utilities (electricity, gas, water, transportation, telephone, or internet).\n\nAny mortgage obligations, lease agreements, and utilities must have been in\nplace before February 15, 2020.\n\nThe amount of loan forgiveness is reduced if there is a reduction in the\nnumber of employees or a reduction of greater than 25% in wages paid to\nemployees during the 8-week period. The extent of the reduction based on\nemployee count is determined by dividing the average number of full-time\nequivalent employees per month for the eight-week period by either: (1) the\naverage number of full-time employees per month from February 15, 2019 to June\n30, 2019; or, at the borrower/employer's election, (2) the average number of\nfull-time employees per month from January 1, 2020 to February 29, 2020.\n\nThe amount of loan forgiveness reduced if there is a reduction in salary is\ndetermined by the amount of the reduction in wages that is greater than 25%\ncompared to their most recent full quarter of wage, assuming 2019 wages were\nless than $100,000 annually.\n\nReductions in PPP loan forgiveness can be cured. Any reductions in employment\nor wages that occur from February 15, 2020 and April 26, 2020 shall not reduce\nthe amount of loan forgiveness if by June 30, 2020, the borrower eliminates\nthe reduction in employees or reduction in wages.\n\nFinally, at least 75% of the amount forgiven must be attributable to payroll\ncosts.\n\nA formal application must be submitted to receive PPP loan forgiveness along\nwith substantiation documentation detailing the factors. Lenders will have 60\ndays following submission to approve or deny the application. To the extent\npart of a PPP loan is not forgiven, the loan continues on these terms: (1) a\nmaturity date of two years; (2) an interest rate of 1%; and (3) deferment of\npayment of principal, interest and fees for a period of six months.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n  1. Keep detailed records during the eight-week covered period of amounts paid for payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent, and utilities (including electricity, gas, water, transportation, telephone, or internet access), and keep copies of checks (along with invoices, bills, and/or bank statements) used to pay the aforementioned sums.\n  2. Keep meticulous documentation verifying the number of employees on payroll and pay rates during February 15, 2020 to June 30, 2020. This will help you tremendously on the back-end during the application for forgiveness process.\n  3. The SBA Administrator's Interim Final Rule added another limitation to the forgiveness qualifications - at least 75% of the forgiveness amount must be attributable to payroll costs.\n  4. If all or part of a PPP loan is forgiven, the amount of the loan forgiveness is not included in the borrower's taxable income (most canceled debt becomes taxable income at the time of cancelation).\n  5. An employer is not eligible for the employee retention credit if the employer receives a PPP loan. See more details on the employee retention credit in the discussion of the tax provision of the CARES Act below.\n  6. Example - John's Stone & Tile, Inc. (JST), a stone and tile supplier for commercial and residential construction companies, applies for a PPP loan on April 15, 2020, and makes the requisite certifications. JST had $2.4 million in payroll costs for the period of April 15, 2019 through April 14, 2020, for monthly average payroll costs of $200,000. JST is entitled to a PPP loan of $500,000 ($200,000 in average monthly payroll costs * 2.5). In the first eight weeks after JST receives the PPP loan disbursements, it spends $425,000 on payroll costs, mortgage interest, and utilities. Assume there is no employee loss, no reduced wages, and at least 75% of the $425,000 is attributable to payroll costs. JST is eligible to have $425,000 of the PPP loan forgiven. JST submits the forgiveness application in the amount of $425,000 and it is approved. The forgiveness of the $425,000 does not generate taxable income to JST. The remaining $75,000 of unforgiven PPP loan has a maturity of two years and an interest rate of 1%. In addition, any payments due on the remaining $75,000 will be deferred for six months.\n  7. Example with Reduced Loan Forgiveness - Same as the example of above, but with the following additional facts: \n    1. JST's average employee headcount: \n      1. During the eight-week covered period is 50.\n      2. From February 15, 2019 - June 30, 2019 was 60.\n      3. From January 1, 2020 - February 29, 2020 was 55.\n    2. Reduced forgiveness under using the period from February 15, 2019 - June 30, 2019 as the denominator would be - 425,000 * (50/60) = $354,166.67 forgiven with ($70,833.33 + $75,000 =) $145,833.33 to be paid back over 2 years at a 1% interest rate with a six month deferral.\n    3. Reduced forgiveness under using the period from January 1, 2020 - February 29, 2020 as the denominator would be - 425,000 * (50/55) = $386,363.64 forgiven with ($38,636.36 + $75,000 =) $113,636.36 to be paid back over two years at a 1% interest rate with a six month deferral.\n\n####  \n\n#### **Expansion of SBA 7(b)(2) Disaster Loans**\n\nThe CARES Act expands access to SBA 7(b)(2) Economic Injury Disaster Loans\n(Disaster Loans) to include not only businesses with fewer than 500 employees,\nbut also sole proprietors and ESOPs. Disaster loans are working capital loans\nof up to $2 million that can be used to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts\npayable, and other bills that could have been paid had the disaster not\noccurred. They are not meant for business expansion. Interest rates on\ndisaster loans are 3.75% for small businesses. The maximum loan term is 30\nyears. There is no loan forgiveness with a disaster loan.\n\nFor any loan made under this program before December 31, 2020, no personal\nguarantee will be required on loans below $200,000. The CARES Act allows a\ndisaster loan to be taken out between January 31, 2020 and the date on which a\nPPP is available for reasons \"other than paying payroll costs.\" Presumably,\nany loan taken out for payroll purposes will be confined to the PPP loans\ndescribed above, even though disaster loans have historically been available\nto cover payroll. The exact dynamics between the two loans is still unclear,\nbut it may be possible to apply for both so long as the disaster loan is not\nused to fund payroll. If a PPP loan is ultimately approved it appears that the\ndisaster loan will be refinanced into the PPP loan.\n\nApplications for disaster loans are submitted directly to the SBA\n[online](https://www.sba.gov/page/disaster-loan-applications), with the\napproval process generally taking about a month. Given this, the CARES Act\ncreates a new Emergency Grant to allow a business that has applied for a\ndisaster loan to get an immediate advance (within three days) of up to\n$10,000. The advance can be used to pay for any of the above noted allowable\ndisaster loan expenses, and is not required to be repaid, even if the\nborrower's request for a disaster loan is denied.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n  1. Most in the construction industry will likely find a PPP loan to be more beneficial, but businesses should consider eligibility, maximum loan amounts, loan forgiveness, maximum maturity, and interest rate before choosing between a PPP and a disaster loan.\n  2. The CARES Act also provides benefits to those with existing loans under Section 7(a) of the Small Business Act other than the new PPP loans, in the form of a government subsidy whereby the SBA will pay six months of principal, interest, and fees on qualifying loans.\n\n#### **Tax Provisions for Businesses**\n\n## Employee Retention Credit\n\nThe CARES Act provides a refundable payroll tax credit for 50% of wages paid\nby eligible employers to certain employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. The\n[employee retention credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-employee-\nretention-credit-available-for-many-businesses-financially-impacted-by-\ncovid-19) is only available in 2020 and a business is considered an eligible\nemployer if:\n\n  * Business operations were fully or partially suspended due to COVID-19; or\n  * Business operations continued, but during any quarter in 2020, gross receipts for that quarter were less than 50% of what they were for the same quarter in 2019. The business will remain eligible for the credit in 2020 until the business has a quarter where its gross receipts exceed 80% of what they were for the same quarter in the previous year; and\n  * The employer has not received a PPP loan or another SBA 7(a) loan.\n\nThe credit is for 50% of \"qualified wages,\" the definition of which depends on\nthe employer's size. For employers who had an average number of 100 or fewer\nfull-time employees in 2019, all employee wages are eligible, regardless of\nwhether the employee is furloughed. For employers who averaged more than 100\nfull-time employees in 2019, only the wages of employees who are furloughed or\nfaced reduced hours as a result of their employers' closure or reduced gross\nreceipts are eligible for the credit. The effective period for paying\nqualified wages runs from March 13, 2020 through December 31, 2020. The\nemployee retention credit is capped at the first $10,000 of compensation,\nincluding health benefits, paid to an employee. It is refundable if it exceeds\nthe business's liability for payroll taxes.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n  1. Given the credits provided for paid sick leave and family leave in the also recently enacted Family First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the employee retention credit will be refundable to many employers, including those in the construction industry.\n  2. The CARES Act appears to use the aggregation rules of IRC \u00a7\u00a7 52 and 414 to determine which entities are treated as a single employer for determining the employee count.\n  3. For the employee retention credit in the CARES Act, the window qualified wages runs from March 13, 2020 through December 31, 2020. But, per [Notice 2020-21](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-20-21.pdf), the IRS established that the effective date of the FFCRA for qualified sick leave and family leave starts on 4/1/2020 and continues through 12/31/2020. So, we have two different effective dates for three credits that impact payroll taxes for 2020.\n  4. The IRS created a FAQs page concerning the Employee Retention Credit that may be found [here](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/faqs-employee-retention-credit-under-the-cares-act).\n  5. Employers need to understand that this retention credit cannot be claimed if they took out a 7(a) loan under the SBA, including PPP loans.\n\n## Delay of Payment/Deposit of Employer Payroll Taxes\n\nOn top of the credits in the FFCRA and the employee retention credit noted\nabove, the CARES Act allows for the deferral of the employer's share of the\n6.2% Social Security tax that would otherwise be due in 2020 from the date of\nenactment through December 31, 2020, to be paid on December 31, 2021 (50%) and\nDecember 31, 2022 (50%). Similarly, a self-employed taxpayer can defer paying\n50% of his or her self-employment tax that would be due from the date of\nenactment through the end of 2020 until the end of 2021 (25%) and 2022 (25%).\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n  1. Employers will be able to: (1) defer payment of its share of Social Security tax until 2021 and 2022, but (2) receive immediate credits against those to-be-paid later payroll taxes in through the sick leave and family leave credits in the FFCRA and the employee retention credit. Who knows how this will be administered on income and payroll tax filings for 2020? Good luck, IRS.\n  2. Social Security Trust Funds will be held harmless under this provision.\n  3. The CARES Act includes special rules for third-party payroll providers and professional employer organizations.\n  4. The deferral does not apply to employers who took out a loan under section 7(a) of the SBA, including PPP loans.\n\n## Net Operating Losses - Temporary Carryback Allowance\n\nThe CARES Act provides for a temporary five-year carryback period for net\noperating losses (NOLs) arising in calendar years 2018, 2019, and 2020 and\nallows NOLs for those calendar years to offset 100% of taxable income until\nthe 2021 tax year. Taxpayers may elect out of this five-year carryback regime,\nbut that election is irrevocable. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are\ncarved-out of the CARES Act carryback rules. The creation of this temporary\nfive-year carryback regime will require some taxpayers to track three\ndifferent groupings of federal NOLs:\n\n  * Incurred prior to 2018 (pre-TCJA) - 2-year carryback, 20-year carryforward, and eligible to offset 100% of taxable income.\n  * Incurred after 12/31/2017 and before 1/1/2021 (CARES Act) - 5-year carryback, indefinite carryforward, eligible to offset 100% of taxable income when carried forward to 2019 and 2020, but only eligible to offset 80% of taxable income when carried forward to 2021 and subsequent years.\n  * Incurred after 12/31/2020 (TCJA adjusted by CARES Act) - no carryback, indefinite carryforward, and eligible to offset 80% of taxable income.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n  1. A corporation can carryback 2018, 2019, and 2020 NOLs to offset pre-2018 ordinary income or capital gains that were taxed at a rate up to 35%, which generates a current refund and a significant favorable rate differential. In other words, to the extent NOLs can be increased in 2020 via accelerated deductions, deferred revenue, or the impacts of COVID-19, permanent cash tax savings could be generated if those NOLs can be carried back to profitable, higher tax rate years. In addition, if NOLs were already on the books in 2018 and 2019, prior income tax liabilities could be offset as far back as 2013 or 2014.\n  2. Corporations in the construction industry may have some flexibility to defer revenue and accelerate deductions depending on the long-term contract accounting method they utilize, or they could potentially change accounting methods.\n  3. Basically, this provision aims to provide cash flow and liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n  4. The CARES Act does not modify the rules related to capital losses.\n\n## Technical Correction for Qualified Improvement Property\n\nThe TCJA amended IRC \u00a7 168(k) to allow for 100% bonus depreciation for certain\nqualified property. Then the TCJA eliminated pre-existing definitions for\nseveral categories of property generally eligible for bonus depreciation and\nreplaced them with one category called qualified improvement property (QIP).\nIt was intended by the drafters that QIP have a 15-year recovery period and be\neligible for bonus depreciation, but a specific recovery period was not\nreflected in the TCJA. Thus, under the TCJA, QIP technically had a 39-year\nrecovery period and was ineligible for 100% bonus depreciation.\n\nThe CARES Act provides a needed and much anticipated technical correction\nconcerning QIP. It specifically and retroactively designates QIP as 15-year\nproperty (20-year for ADS) for depreciation purposes; thus, QIP is eligible\nfor 100% bonus depreciation if placed in service after December 31, 2017.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n  1. Automatic accounting method changes will likely need to be filed to comply with this technical correction and obtain the benefit through an IRC \u00a7 481(a) adjustment. Taxpayers are generally required to file a change of accounting method when the depreciation method changes. Here, QIP placed in service after 2017 that has initially been depreciated as 39-year building property, will need to be changed to 15-year property that is eligible for 100% bonus depreciation.\n  2. However, if a QIP asset was only depreciated on a single tax return, it was placed in service in 2018, and the 2019 return has not yet been filed, the depreciation method may be corrected with an amended 2018 return.\n  3. Hopefully, the IRS will issue some procedural guidance concerning the filing of automatic accounting method changes or amended returns under these circumstances. Particularly concerning partnerships subject to the [centralized audit regime](https://www.nexsenpruet.com/insights/is-your-partnership-ready-for-the-irss-new-centralized-audit-regime) of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as many partnerships will likely need to file Administrative Adjustment Requests with the benefit accounted for in 2020.\n  4. The CARES Act does not permit the ability to change prior-year elections concerning the depreciation of QIP. Nothing in the CARES Act allows for a taxpayer to go back and elect out of bonus depreciation for property placed in service in 2018 or election to use ADS.\n  5. This technical correction will create a multimillion swing in depreciation deductions available for many taxpayers, including those in the construction industry, particularly architectural and engineering firms with larger or multiple offices that make tenant improvements to office space they lease.\n\n## Relaxation of the Limitation on Business Interest\n\nThe TCJA added IRC \u00a7 163(j), which limits the ability of a business to deduct\nits interest expense to 30% of its adjusted taxable income (ATI) while any\nexcess interest is carried forward. ATI equals a taxpayer's taxable income\ncomputed without regard to: (1) any item of income, gain, deduction, or loss\nthat is not properly allocable to a trade or business; (2) business interest\nor business interest income; (3) the amount of any NOL deduction; (4) the 20%\ndeduction for certain pass-through income; and (5) for tax years beginning\nbefore January 1, 2022, any deduction allowable for depreciation,\namortization, or depletion.\n\nThe CARES Act increases the ATI limit from 30% to 50% for 2019 and 2020, and\nallows a business to elect to use its 2019 ATI when computing its 2020\nlimitation (since many businesses in 2020 will likely not have taxable income\nin 2020). Taxpayers are allowed to elect-out of the application to the\ntemporary new rule.\n\nFor partnerships, the 50% ATI limitation does not apply to 2019. Instead,\ninterest disallowed at the partnership level is allocated to the partners and\nsuspended at the partner-level under the normal rules. However, in 2020 there\nis a bifurcation: 50% of the suspended interest becomes available and\ndeductible, while the other 50% will remain suspended until the partnership\nallocates excess taxable income or excess interest income to the partner (or\nthe partnership is no longer subject to IRC \u00a7 163(j).\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n  1. The ability of a business to elect to use its 2019 ATI limitation in 2020 could generate some significant tax savings. For example, if a business had ATI of $8 million in 2019 but a negative ATI in 2020, it could elect to deduct $4 million of interest expense in 2020 (50% of $8 million), generate a bigger loss, and then use the favorable new NOL provisions to carryback the loss to 2019 (or prior years) and recover taxes paid in that year (or prior years).\n  2. If NOLs arise in 2019 or 2020 on account of either the increased IRC \u00a7 163(j) limitation or the treatment of excess business interest expense allocated to a partner for a taxable year beginning in 2019, those NOLs are now available for carryback and are not subject to the 80 percent limitation pursuant the CARES Act changes to the NOLs rules discussed above.\n\n## Temporary Reversal of the Limitation of Excess Business Losses\n\nThe CARES Act removes the excess business loss limitation (the fourth\nlimitation on an individual's ability to use losses from a business added via\nthe TCJA) under IRC \u00a7 461(l) for the calendar years 2018, 2019, and 2020, by\nchanging the effective date of the excess business loss limitation rule to\napply for any tax year beginning after 12/31/2020, and before 1/1/2026. This\nmodification is retroactive back to December 31, 2017. Further, the CARES Act\nincludes some technical corrections to IRC \u00a7 461(l), namely that wages will\nnot be considered business income, which should result in more losses being\nlimited in most cases when it becomes effective again in 2021.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n  1. Amended returns will need to be filed for 2018 (and 2019 if already filed) to account of the retroactive nature of the removal of IRC \u00a7 461(l).\n  2. These amended returns will likely report larger losses given the removal of the limitation leading to potential refunds for the individual owners of the pass-through entities.\n  3. Given the delay of the effective date of IRC \u00a7 461(l) until after 2020, pass-through entities may not even need to report IRC \u00a7 461(l) information on Schedules K-1 until the 2021 tax year.\n\n## Acceleration of the Ability to Use Corporate Minimum Tax Credits\n\nThe CARES Act allows corporations to accelerate the utilization of their\nremaining minimum tax credits (MTCs) from the pre-TCJA alternative minimum tax\n(AMT) regime. The TCJA repealed corporate AMT and allowed corporations to\nclaim outstanding AMT credits or MTCs subject to certain limits for tax years\nprior to 2021, at which time any remaining AMT credit may be claimed as fully-\nrefundable. The CARES Act allows corporations to claim 100% of MTCs in 2019 as\nfully refundable and provides an election to accelerate claims to 2018, with\neligibility for accelerated refunds.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n  1. Taxpayers that used MTCs to offset regular tax liabilities in 2018 may be able to use the new NOL carryback rules to get a refund.\n  2. The accelerated refund claims for 2018 will be treated as tentative carryback refund claims under IRC \u00a7 6411\\. The application must be filed before 12/31/2020. An amended return is not required.\n  3. These CARES Act amendments are intended to provide a cash refund for carryforward MTCs following the TCJA's elimination of corporate AMT.\n\n#### **Tax Provisions for Individuals**\n\n## Individual Recovery Rebates\n\nPerhaps the most discussed provision of the CARES Act concerns the direct\nindividual stimulus payments, officially dubbed \"recovery rebates\" also known\nas \"economic impact payments,\" which involves the IRS sending over $500\nbillion via check or direct deposit to most American adults. The new statute\nprovides $1,200 for single-filers and heads of household and $2,400 for joint\nfilers, along with $500 per qualifying child (using the Child Tax Credit\nprovisions). Thus, a jointly-filing family of four would get $3,400 before the\napplication of any phase out rules.\n\nThe direct payments start to phase out at a 5% rate above adjusted gross\nincomes (AGI) of $75,000 for single-filers, $122,500 for heads of households,\nand $150,000 for joint-filers. The point at which a taxpayer no longer will\nreceive any direct payment depends on filing status and qualifying children.\nFor example:\n\n  * Single-filer with no children is completely phased out if AGI exceeds $99,000 | (1,200 / 5%) = 75,000 = 99,000).\n  * Head of Household with one child completely phased out if AGI exceeds $156,500 | ((1,200 + 500) /5%) + 122,500 = $156,500.\n  * Joint-filer with no children is completely phased out if AGI exceeds $198,000 | (2,400 / 5%) + 150,000 = 198,000.\n  * Joint-filer with two children is completely phased out if AGI exceeds $218,000 | ((2,400 + 1,000) / 5%) + $150,000 = $218,000.\n\nGenerally, taxpayers must submit the SSNs for each family member claiming the\ndirect payments. But, since these direct payments are going to be advanced\nrefunds for 2020 and the IRS is supposed to send these direct payments as soon\nas possible, a taxpayer's AGI will initially be determined by referencing the\n2019 tax return. If a 2019 tax return has not been filed, the IRS will look at\nyour 2018 return. Non-filers generally need to file a tax return to claim the\nrebate, unless you are not required to file but information if available to\nthe IRS via Forms SSA-1099 or RRB-0199. More information for non-filers is\navailable [here](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-\nyou-need-to-know). Note, the direct payment credit will be recomputed again on\nthe filing of taxpayer's 2020 return in calendar year 2021 based on 2020 data.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n  1. For most taxpayers, no action will be required on their part to receive the direct payment. However, the credit payment amount must be recalculated on the filing of 2020 tax returns.\n  2. The recalculation of the direct payment amount on your 2020 tax return based on your 2020 data could lead to significant differences between the 2020 calculation and the direct payment you actually received based on a 2018 or 2019 tax return. If the advance payment was less than what you are owed in 2020, i.e., you were phased out in 2019 but not 2020 or you had another child or different filing status, the excess will be treated as a credit that reduces your 2020 tax liability.\n  3. If the advance payment received is greater than what you're owed on your 2020 tax return, or you're completely phased out per your 2020 tax return, you should not have to repay or return the excess. The CARES Act does not explicitly require any income recognition on the excess advanced payment received, and it says that the credit cannot be reduced below zero by the advanced payments. This could create some planning opportunities if you have not yet filed your 2019 return.\n  4. The expected expedited calculation and processing of this direct advanced payment/rebate is going to be an administrative nightmare for an already understaffed IRS. Even though the IRS has paused some [compliance and collection efforts](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-unveils-new-people-first-initiative-covid-19-effort-temporarily-adjusts-suspends-key-compliance-program) during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is still being asked to perform what seems to be an impossible task. Will the IRS stagger the issuance of the checks over several months like it did with the 2008 stimulus checks to prevent overwhelming its staff and technology? Treasury wants them issued in [three weeks](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know). We'll see what happens.\n\n## Relaxation of Retirement Plan Restrictions\n\nGenerally, if you receive a distribution from a qualified retirement plan\nbefore the age of 59 \u00bd, you pay income tax on the distribution and IRC \u00a7 72(t)\nimposes a 10% penalty (or additional tax) on the distribution unless an\nexception is applicable. The CARES Act adds a new exception by providing that\nthe 10% penalty does not apply to any \"coronavirus-related distribution\" up to\n$100,000. A \"coronavirus-related distribution\" is a distribution made during\n2020 to an individual:\n\n  * Who is diagnosed with COVID-19 with a test approved by the Center for Disease Control (CDC);\n  * Whose spouse or dependent (as defined by IRC \u00a7 152) is diagnosed with COVID-19; or\n  * Who experiences adverse financial consequences as a result of being quarantined, furloughed, laid off, having work hours reduced, being unable to work due to lack of child care due to COVID-19, closing or reducing hours of a business because of COVID-19, or other factors determined by Treasury.\n\nWhile a \"coronavirus-related distribution\" avoids the 10% penalty, it is still\nsubject to income tax; however, the CARES Act allows you to spread the income\ntax burden over a three-year period starting with 2020. Income recognition can\nbe avoided entirely by repaying the distribution to the retirement plan within\nthree years of receipt. This repayment does not apply against contribution\nlimitations. In addition, the loan amount an individual can borrow against\nhis/her plan increases from $50,000 to $100,000 for the 180-day period\nstarting after the CARES Act is enacted, while certain outstanding loans that\nwere previously due on or before December 31, 2020, will be delayed for one\nyear. Finally, for individuals 72 and older that are normally required to\nwithdraw a \"required minimum distribution\" from the retirement plan, the CARES\nAct waives the minimum distribution rules for calendar year 2020.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n  1. While it's generally best to leave your retirement plan alone, the waiver of the 10% penalty and the spread of income recognition over three years will soften the impact of 2020 early withdrawals.\n  2. For more specifics on the employee/retirement related benefits read [this](https://www.nexsenpruet.com/insights/cares-act----new-employee-benefit-tools-to-support-affected-employees).\n\n## Charitable Contributions\n\nThe enactment of the TCJA in December of 2017 almost doubled the applicable\nstandard deduction, but curtailed many itemized deductions, like the one for\nstate and local taxes paid. This led to less than 10% of taxpayers itemizing\ntheir deductions in 2018. To account for this and provide some extra relief,\nthe CARES Act provides a new \"above the line\" deduction of up to $300 to\nindividual taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions.\n\nFor individual taxpayers that do itemize their deductions, the CARES Act\ntemporarily raises the AGI limitations on charitable giving to public\ncharities and donations from 60% to 100%. Excess contributions may be carried\nforward for five years. The limitation on corporation donors is increased from\n10% of adjusted taxable income to 25%. In all cases the charitable\ncontribution must be made in case to a public charity or foundation as defined\nin IRC \u00a7 170(b)(1)(A).\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n  1. Taxpayers who itemized are not permitted to claim the $300 above the line deduction allowed to taxpayers who do not itemize. Taxpayers who itemize must still report on charitable contributions on Schedule A, but the AGI limitations were increased to 100%.\n  2. There is no requirement that the contribution be used in COVID-19 relief efforts in order to take advantage of the above the line deduction or higher percentage limitations as applicable.\n\n#### **Conclusion**\n\nWhile the CARES Act provides approximate $2 trillion in stimulus money to\ncombat COVID-19 and help people and businesses absorb the impact of COVID-19,\nmany think additional relief is needed, particularly those in the hospitality\nand construction industries. The House is already discussing another package.\nIt remains unclear how many of the Federal agencies, including the IRS, will\nbe able to implement some of these sweeping changes in an expedited manner\nwhile their own employees are impacted by COVID-19 just like everyone else.\nTime will tell.\n\n[__Send](javascript:sendit\\(\\);) [__Print](javascript:window.print\\(\\);)\n[__Report](/reportaproblem/index.aspx)\n\n### Latest Posts\n\n  * [Five Things to Consider when Calculating Qualified Health Plan Expenses Under the FFCRA](/legalnews/five-things-to-consider-when-22456/)\n  * [COVID-19 Impacts - The CARES Act and the Construction Industry](/legalnews/covid-19-impacts-the-cares-act-and-the-35341/)\n  * [Act Now - SBA Loans Available](/legalnews/act-now-sba-loans-available-79333/)\n  * [NC Legislative Update: April 2020 #1](/legalnews/nc-legislative-update-april-2020-1-56684/)\n  * [Need a Loan Modification?

Employee\nRewards](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/content_images/use_data_to_design_employee_rewards_5ce544daab54c.jpg)\n\n**_Organizations are looking at new and innovative ways to reward and retain\ntheir employees. Data can play a major role here, tailoring these gifts to\nspecific requirements. Learn how:_**\n\n  * _Different data sources can be combined for actionable insights_\n  * _Three tech companies are enabling data-driven employee rewards strategies_\n  * _You can benefit from reconfiguring your rewards scheme using data_\n\n  \nAn intelligent Rewards & Recognition (R&R;) strategy can help you motivate\nemployees and encourage optimum performance. However, limiting R&R; to events\nsuch as work anniversaries or cyclical \u201cEmployee of the Month\u201d programs\ndecouples rewards from actual achievements. Since such employee rewards are\nnot powered by real-time performance data, they risk becoming irrelevant and\noverlooked as a genuine driver for performance. This is why it is important to\nleverage the latest datasets \u2013 around performance, lifestyle preferences, as\nwell as future work potential \u2013 to engage and reward your employees.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834dc302698.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n## How Can HR Apply Data to Employee Rewards Programs?\n\nA decade ago, data-driven employee rewards would mean detailed surveys and\nscorecards, infinite spreadsheets, and complex calculations to arrive at the\nideal gift. Fortunately, modern HR is all about technology adoption, and HR\ntech is making major strides in the R&R; space.\n\nCombined with other HR tech functionalities, including different Human\nResource Management Systems (HRMS) and benefits administration platforms,\nthere is a vast dataset to glean insights from. Automation makes this even\nsimpler, by integrating the various elements of an employee\u2019s professional\njourney to gather comprehensive data and auto-recommend employee rewards.\n\nLearn more: [Employee Appreciation Day Exclusive \u2013 4 Ways Technology Can\nAmplify Your Rewards and Recognition\nPrograms](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-\nrecognition/employee-appreciation-day-exclusive-4-ways-technology-can-amplify-\nyour-rewards-and-recognition-programs/)\n\n## Three HR Tech Platforms Using Data to Reimagine Employee Rewards Design and\nDistribution Models\n\n1\\. KangoGift powered by [IBM\nWatson](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-\nibm-watson-openscale-could-drive-ai-adoption-in-human-resources/) makes\nemployee rewards a simple, three-step process\n\n[KangoGift\n](https://www-356.ibm.com/partnerworld/gsd/solutiondetails.do?solution=49109&lc=en&stateCd=P&tab=2)allows\nHR to go beyond formalized R&R; plans. Instead, it offers informal, on-the-\nspot [recognition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-\nrecognition/why-employee-recognition-is-important/) driven by three kinds of\ndata: **who** , **why** , and **what**. Through a simple [three-part\nprocess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4prswhqTEM), managers can quickly\nsend gifts which can be redeemed at a variety of vendor outlets, based on the\nunique achievement/s of the employee. The solution also features detailed\nanalytics, social recognition, as well as open APIs for integration with your\nexisting HR systems.\n\n### 2.SelfDrvn takes a gamified approach to employee rewards\n\n[SelfDrvn ](https://selfdrvn.com/)uses gamification to connect the entire\nperformance-to-rewards pathway. Employees are credited reward points for\nprofessional accomplishments which can be redeemed after reaching a certain\nthreshold. These are also published on an internal newsfeed so peers can also\nappreciate an individual\u2019s contribution. At its core, SelfDrvn utilizes the\npower of data to create an engaging and highly interactive rewards ecosystem\nwhere work is automatically translated into points, points converted to\nrewards, and finally, into social recognition.\n\n### 3\\. Bonusly enables personalization of employee rewards\n\n[Bonusly](https://bonus.ly/) works on a simple premise: data should help\ntailor rewards to each employee\u2019s preferences. Users are allocated a monthly\n\u201callowance\u201d which can be channeled into a variety of gift options. This covers\na vast global catalog, including payment services such as PayPal or the Google\nPlay store, retail outlets such as Amazon or Starbucks, and even media\nstreaming platforms like Hulu. Bonusly\u2019s USP is that based on employee data,\nyou could even hyper-personalize rewards \u2013 for example, a lunch with the CEO!\n\nLearn more: [Get Your Reward Strategies 2019-Ready With Big\nData](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/get-your-\nreward-strategies-2019ready-with-big-data/)\n\n## The Very Real Benefits of Data-Driven Employee Rewards\n\nIn the war for talent, well-crafted reward programs have emerged as a major\ndifferentiator. Organizations can use employee rewards to improve retention\nand employee experience.\n\nA rewards program informed by clean and comprehensive datasets will help you:\n\n  * **Attract top candidates:** In a fierce talent market, it can be difficult to capture top candidates without committing to exceptionally high wages. An R&R; plan which links rewards to performance using data will ensure that you hire the most highly motivated and self-driven candidates.\n  * **Retain high-potential employees:** The [High Potential](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-to-spot-high-potential-candidates-for-hire/) or \u201cHi-Po\u201d segment is invaluable to the future of your organization, putting in 21 percent more effort than a non-Hi-Po; however, engaging with them can be tricky. Gartner found that [73 percent of Hi-Po programs grapple with low ROI ](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/insights/leadership-management/high-potentials)\u2013 making timely rewards a critical tool for employee engagement.\n  * **Improve the bottom line and top line:** Armed with data, you will only invest in the most relevant employee rewards and gifts, reducing bloated costs. Also, employees are likely to perform better if any instance of exceptional performance is acknowledged and rewarded, regardless of monthly or annual cycles.\n\n  \nLearn more: [9 Reasons Why You Need Rewards and Recognition\nTechnology](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-\nrecognition/9-reasons--you-need-rewards-and-recognition-tech/)\n\nSimply put, without data, your R&R; program will only become a cost center,\nconsuming budgets but not really contributing to organizational goals. We\nrecommend that you start with the basics and identify the data sources\navailable in your organization. This will lay the foundations for selecting\nthe right HR tech solution, which will seamlessly incorporate data-driven\ninsights with your employee rewards scheme.\n\n_Have you considered how data could optimize employee rewards?_ _Share your\ninsights with us on_[\n_Facebook_](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=3495&zd_term=pujalalwani)\n_,_[ _LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-\ntechnologist/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=3495&zd_term=pujalalwani) _, or_[\n_Twitter_](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist?lang=en?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=3495&zd_term=pujalalwani)\n_._ _We are always listening!_\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2F3-ways-to-use-data-to-design-employee-\nrewards%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=3+Ways+to+Use+Data+to+Design+Employee+Rewards\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=3+Ways+to+Use+Data+to+Design+Employee+Rewards&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2F3-ways-to-use-data-to-design-employee-\nrewards%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2F3-ways-to-use-data-to-design-employee-\nrewards%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2F3-ways-to-use-data-to-design-employee-\nrewards%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=3 Ways to Use Data to Design Employee\nRewards&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-and-\nrecognition%2F3-ways-to-use-data-to-design-employee-\nrewards%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Rewards & Recognition ](/category/rewards-and-\nrecognition/ \"Rewards & Recognition\")\n\n  * [ ![How to Retain Top Talent with Employee Recognition: Q&A With Cord Himelstein of Halo Recognition](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/halo_recognition_hr_talk_interview_545_x_240_px_5dc1685b95dbf.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/rewards-and-recognition/cord-himelstein-halo-recognition-top-talent/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How to Retain Top Talent with Employee Recognition: Q&A; With Cord\nHimelstein of Halo Recognition\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/rewards-and-recognition/cord-\nhimelstein-halo-recognition-top-talent/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nCord Himelstein, VP of marketing and communication, Halo Recognition, speaks\nabout how HR needs to approach employee recognition programs and more.\n\nby [Neha Pradhan](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/neha-\npradhan/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Nov 05, 2019\n\n  * [ ![6 Statistics That Confirm Employee Recognition and Retention Are Related](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/statistics_for_employee_recognition_and_retention_5e4e903c0e87c.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-recognition/employee-recognition-and-retention-statistics/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 6 Statistics That Confirm Employee Recognition and Retention Are\nRelated ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-\nrecognition/employee-recognition-and-retention-\nstatistics/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nFor companies looking to strengthen their retention capabilities, an effective\nrecognition program is essential.

Bersin](https://hrexecutive.com/author/josh-bersin/ \"Posts by Josh\nBersin\") | January 29, 2020 \u2022 3 min read\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/themes/riskandinsurance/avatars/468.png)\n\nJosh Bersin writes _HRE_ \u2019s HR in the Flow of Work column. Bersin is an\nanalyst, author, educator and thought leader focusing on the global talent\nmarket and the challenges and trends impacting business workforces around the\nworld. He recently spoke at the [HR Technology Conference in Las\nVegas](https://www.hrtechnologyconference.com/). He can be emailed at\nhreletters@lrp.com.\n\nTopics: [Benefits and\nCompensation](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/) |\n[Career Development](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/career-\ndevelopment-talentmanagement/) |\n[Columnists](https://hrexecutive.com/category/columnists/) |\n[Compensation](https://hrexecutive.com/category/benefitsandcompensation/compensation-\nbenefitsandcompensation/) | [Employee\nRecognition](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/employee-\nrecognition/) | [HR\nLeadership](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrleadership/) | [HR\nTechnology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [HR Technology\nConference News](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-technology-\nconference/) | [Talent\nManagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/)\n\nToday\u2019s organizations are very interconnected. People work in a more agile\nfashion (though not necessarily in the [agile](https://hrexecutive.com/agile-\norganizations-need-leadership-not-management/) methodology), they lend a hand\nto other projects and teams, and their managers are less involved in their\nday-to- day activities.\n\n[Edgar Schein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Schein), former professor\nfor the MIT Sloan School of Management, once told me that the most valuable\ncultural asset for any company is the desire of employees to help each other.\nTherefore, we should be thinking about how we motivate and recognize people\nwho demonstrate this behavior.\n\nThe [traditional performance process](https://joshbersin.com/2018/11/we-\nwasted-ten-years-talking-about-performance-ratings-the-seven-things-weve-\nlearned/) is based on _individual_ achievements. However, research now shows\nthat the highest-performing companies reward people for team goals, not just\nindividual goals. Yet, fewer than one-third of companies do this.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n**See also:[How to bring out the best in teams](https://hrexecutive.com/how-\nto-bring-out-the-best-in-your-teams/)**\n\nMost performance-management processes are also riddled with other problems.\n[Mercer\u2019s 2019 Global Performance Management Study\n](https://www.mercer.us/our-thinking/career/global-performance-management-\nstudy-2019.html) found that only 2% of leaders believe their performance\nprocess delivers high value, only a half have goals at the business-unit level\nand fewer than 3% believe they have excellent feedback practices. The study\nalso found that only 30% of companies rate managers on their people-leadership\ncapabilities, and only 9% reward managers based on their ability to lead\npeople.\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Performance-\nManagement.1.28.20-700x394.png)\n\nAs I learned during my seven years at Deloitte, the success of the\norganization is based on alignment, continuous feedback, trust and\naccountability. The Mercer study clearly points out that pay-for-performance\nis on the rise, and the top driver of success is a sense of fairness and\ntransparency in pay.\n\nI\u2019m seeing performance management again taking center stage, but this time\nit\u2019s all about sound goal setting, clear expectations, focus, feedback, growth\nand a fair, equitable and well-designed way of rewarding people. Additionally,\nthe HR-driven employee-performance process must be directly linked to business\ngoals.\n\nWhat do we do about pay? It\u2019s still very important, but in today\u2019s world, we\nhave to review it more often, adjust it based on market changes, and create\ntotal transparency in the process. I recently talked with an executive whose\ncompany does quarterly pay reviews for all major roles, and employees receive\ncost-of-living adjustments at least once per year. Patagonia aligns raises in\nbase pay for an individual\u2019s in-the-job performance and then pays high bonuses\nfor beyond-the-job contributions. Pay is an area with many opportunities to\ninnovate.\n\n**[CLICK HERE](https://hrexecutive.com/author/josh-bersin/) for more columns\nfrom Josh Bersin**\n\nFinally, the research points out that career growth is key to performance and\nrewards. The best reward for any ambitious person is a promotion. That may not\nmean a higher-level job, but it does mean a new, exciting, expanded role.\nCreating a talent network for career growth is key to the future of work.\n\nAs you think about your priorities for the year ahead, I strongly advise you\nto revisit the performance and pay practices in your company. I\u2019m just\nfinishing up a report on the management of technology workers. Our research\nfound that empowerment, clear goals, pay-for-performance and transparency are\nall key to high performance. In a sense, tech workers are the \u201ccanaries in the\ncoal mine,\u201d teaching us what everyone needs to perform better in this new\nworld.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nLet me conclude with an interesting observation from the Mercer research. The\nauthors claim, \u201cManagers, as we know them, will cease to exist and AI will\nplay a bigger their role.\u201d While I think this prediction is a bit over the\ntop, there is some truth to the statement. One of the biggest challenges I run\ninto as I visit HR teams around the world is the realignment and development\nof leaders to meet the management requirements of today. In this new world,\nleadership is not about setting goals and holding people accountable. I\u2019d\nargue that\u2019s the simplest part of the job. The primary responsibilities are\nlistening, coaching, advising, connecting and serving as the career stewards\nfor the people around you.\n\nTake a good look at your leadership model in the year ahead, and don\u2019t be in\nthe 91% of companies who don\u2019t reward leaders for the real role they play.\nEveryone is a leader in the future of work, and it is important in the year\nahead that we redefine what leaders do.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fperformance-\nand-rewards-in-the-future-of-work%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Josh+Bersin%3A+Performance+and+rewards+in+the+future+of+work&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fperformance-\nand-rewards-in-the-future-of-work%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fperformance-\nand-rewards-in-the-future-of-work%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

are covered by these types of\narrangements.\u201d\n\n[Like other incentive plans](https://hrexecutive.com/incentives-in-the-age-of-\nattrition/), bonus programs have evolved over the decades. Among the most\npopular are individual employee-performance plans (23% offer such bonuses,\naccording to a recent Aon survey of roughly 400 mid-to large-size employers)\nand special recognition plans (52% offered spot bonuses in 2019, compared to\n51% in 2017, reports Aon). However, the trend is shifting toward business-\nincentive plans or bonuses based on multiple performance layers, such as\noverall company results, individual performance and business unit outcomes.\nThis year, approximately 85% of organizations surveyed by Aon have adopted\nthis approach, up from 77% in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n\n\u201cWhen employees below the executive level started getting bonuses, 80% to 90%\nwere individual-performance plans \u2026 a discretionary award given at the end of\nthe year based on a manager\u2019s judgement,\u201d Abosch says. \u201cManagers weren\u2019t\nreally equipped to make good decisions, so they eliminated those plans, which\nbecame profit-sharing plans that focused more or less on company performance\ninstead of individual performance.\u201d\n\n**Related:[Big blue-collar bonuses](https://hrexecutive.com/signing-bonuses-\nas-incentives/)**\n\nHowever, he says, many companies don\u2019t support spot bonuses, believing they\u2019re\ndifficult to manage, aren\u2019t valued by employees and don\u2019t motivate workers.\nUnfortunately, some employers or managers have watered them down by handing\nthem out to all staff throughout the year. But others have designed a\nselection process and are now realizing their powerful impact. Since spot\nbonuses are awarded shortly after an employee accomplishment, Abosch says,\n\u201cthe psychic income value is greater than the actual monetary value.\u201d\n\nStill, business-incentive plans are by far the most popular because they\nenable companies to accomplish alignment and line of sight. Research has shown\nthe importance of making sure employees are aligned to the company\u2019s\nobjectives and goals and thinking about how to help drive them, he explains.\n\n\u201cMore high-performance organizations have come to the realization that broad-\nbased variable pay is the most effective way to send a strong pay-for-\nperformance message and truly differentiate rewards for high performers versus\nlow performers,\u201d Abosch says. \u201cThis form of compensation has evolved from a\nnice-to-have or thank you at the end of the year to a meaningful weapon in the\narsenal of tools that motivate employees to achieve required business\nresults.\u201d\n\n**Bigger Bonuses, Broader Base**\n\nSmall organizations have more wiggle room when awarding bonuses. Consider St.\nJohn Properties, a real estate company that[ divvied up $10 million among its\n198 employees in\nbonuses](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/12/10/real-estate-company-\nsurprises-198-employees-10-million-bonus/4384763002/) at its holiday party\nthis year. Based on tenure, the bonuses ranged from $100, given to an employee\nwho hadn\u2019t stared his job yet, to $270,000 for a longtime employee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n\nAlthough that\u2019s not realistic for large organizations employing thousands of\nworkers, 48% of companies that offer holiday or year-end bonuses plan to\neither increase them or keep them the same, according to a [2019 survey\nconducted by Robert Half](http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2019-12-03-48-Of-\nCompanies-That-Offer-Year-End-Bonuses-Plan-To-Increase-Them-Survey-Finds.), a\nglobal recruiting firm. Yet, 4% anticipate reducing them. The research found\nthat organizations in Nashville, Austin, Denver and Minneapolis are most\nlikely to increase bonuses.\n\n\u201cOver the last couple of years, companies seem to be investing and engaging in\nthese markets,\u201d says Luke Stratmann, metro market manager at Robert Half. He\nbelieves the bonus increases may be needed to attract more skilled talent to\nthese communities.\n\nAnother trend is enhancing transparency. He says more employees receive\nbonuses out in the open, in front of their peers, where they can be cheered\nand applauded for specific accomplishments.\n\n**See also:[The 6 key elements of employee\nexperience](https://hrexecutive.com/the-6-key-elements-of-employee-\nexperience/)**\n\nIn the future, Stratmann believes bonuses will be handed out \u201call the way from\nthe top to the absolute bottom of an organization if we continue to exist in\nthe current employee climate.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, OneDigital has been advising its clients to be more creative\nregarding bonuses, says Stacy Strauser, director of compensation consulting at\nthe employee-benefits and health-consulting firm.\n\nWhile cash remains king, she says, examples of creative bonuses include\ntraining opportunities or enabling employees to work from home for one month.\nAlso consider awarding bonuses to larger groups and for more reasons like\nhelping co-workers complete a task, demonstrating the organization\u2019s values or\nserving as an exceptional team member.\n\n\u201cHave your ducks in a row and document the bonus program in advance, on your\nwebsite,\u201d says Strauser, adding that a website posting could say that employee\nbonuses are based on tenure and the result of the company\u2019s outstanding year.\n\u201cAlways tie bonuses to employee or company performance, and make sure\nemployees know that bonuses are not an entitlement.\u201d\n\nCarol Patton is a contributing editor for _HRE_ who also writes HR articles\nand columns for business and education magazines.

Tanner\u2019s second annual Global Culture Report offers a holistic view of\nthe modern workplace as it sits within the global economy and society at\nlarge.\n\nBy: [Justin Harper](https://hrmasia.com/author/justin-harper/ \"Posts by Justin\nHarper\") | January 9, 2020\n\nTopics: [Asia-Pacific](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/apac/) | [Employee\nExperience](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/employee-experience/) |\n[News](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/news/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020_GCR_Thumb-\nexpereinces.png)\n\nThe happiest and most engaged employees are those who work for companies that\nhave a thriving workplace culture. Such culture enables employees with a sense\nof purpose and identity, which helps build a meaningful employee experience.\n\nHowever, most organisations are missing a crucial piece of the employee\nexperience when it comes to interacting with them, says O.C. Tanner, an expert\nin employee recognition and workplace culture. What they overlook is the wide\nvariety of everyday human interactions and events, trials and triumphs,\nadventures, and misadventures that define life at work. This is the true\nemployee experience that employers often forget.\n\nIf you want to build a thriving workplace culture, create great micro-\nexperiences, O.C. Tanner advises in its 2020 Global Culture Report. It says\nthese micro-experiences should connect employees to purpose, opportunity,\nsuccess, appreciation, wellbeing, and leadership. An organisation filled with\npeak and positive micro-experiences in each of those areas is one that\nemployees will seek to work for, engage with, remain at, and give their heart-\nand-soul to help succeed.\n\n**Burnout fears**\n\nPast research shows a lack of appreciation, conflicts in cooperation, role\nambiguity, and role stress are all strong predictors of burnout. While\nmillennials are more likely than workers of older generations to experience\nit, burnout is similar in white collar and blue-collar workers, leading O.C.\nTanner to believe it\u2019s not the type or amount of work that causes employees to\nburn out, but the culture they work in.\n\nEmployee burnout is the result of chronic culture deficiencies. Poor everyday\nexperiences, like a lack of purpose at work, contributes to increased risk of\nburnout. Employees need to know how what they do impacts the organisation, its\ncustomers, and the rest of society. If leaders fail to help employees see the\nlarger picture, or the \u201cwhy\u201d behind the work they do, there is a 22% increased\nchance of employee burnout, the report warns.\n\n**Thriving teams**\n\nOne way of improving employee engagement and reducing the chances of burnout\nis to build thriving teams. O.C. Tanner\u2019s research uncovered two essential\nbuilding blocks of high performing teams. One is a strong sense of autonomy \u2013\nbeing able to act independently as a team.\n\nEmployees in the modern workplace thrive on autonomy. But that doesn\u2019t mean\neach individual works independently from the others. Instead, the team is\ngranted autonomy as a whole. As a collective, team members can set goals, make\ndecisions, and decide what projects to do and how to do them with little or no\nleader involvement.\n\nThe other characteristic of thriving teams is a strong sense of psychological\nsafety. The basic definition of psychological safety is \u201cbeing able to show\nand employ one\u2019s self without fear of negative consequences of self-image,\nstatus or career.\u201d When employees feel emotionally safe at work and with their\nteams, they can take risks, innovate, share new ideas, and be themselves\nwithout worrying about being criticised or ostracised by their peers.\n\nTo see the full report go to\nwww.[octanner.com/sea/gcr](http://octanner.com/sea/gcr)\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fculture-\nfrom-every-angle%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Culture+from+every+angle&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fculture-\nfrom-every-angle%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fculture-\nfrom-every-angle%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

New research revealed successfully-executed employee reward\nprograms deepen employee engagement and loyalty. The research also found that\nmost employee reward program managers are satisfied with the program\u2019s\nresults, and that gift cards are the most popular reward in employee incentive\nprograms aimed at increasing engagement and retention. These are key findings\nof new incentives research commissioned by branded payments provider\n[Blackhawk Network](http://www.blackhawknetwork.com) that examined the latest\nemployee reward program trends, why these programs are used, how rewards are\nchosen and which rewards employees prefer.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834dd372ea7.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n\u201cThe U.S. unemployment rate is less than four percent and businesses are\noperating in an employee market. Employees are being fought over as businesses\nclamor for the best and brightest\u2014and they expect more from their employers.\nCompanies looking to keep current employees happy are turning to employee\nreward programs,\u201d said Theresa McEndree, vice president of marketing at\nBlackhawk Network. \u201cPeople want to feel appreciated and valued, and businesses\nrealize that rewarding employees goes a long way in boosting loyalty and\nengagement, reducing expensive turnover and encouraging employees to work\nharder. Our research confirms this strategy and provides insights into how to\ndo this most effectively, including offering employees\u2019 favorite rewards: gift\ncards.\u201d\n\nBlackhawk\u2019s research found that the value of employee reward programs is well-\nknown and that reward programs are must-haves for businesses competing for top\ntalent. Of the businesses surveyed, 94 percent offer employee incentives and\nthe majority are satisfied with them.\n\nOther top findings from the incentives research include:\n\nEmployee reward programs are valuable. Of the employee reward program managers\ninterviewed, 79 percent agree or strongly agree that the programs are\nimportant and impact business performance. Eighty-nine percent of those\nsurveyed also feel that the programs are highly valued by employees.\n\nEmployee reward programs drive engagement and loyalty. According to\nrespondents, the main reasons employee reward programs are offered are to\ndeepen engagement, build loyalty and show employees they are valued and\nappreciated. Ninety-two percent of the respondents felt rewards create\nemployee loyalty and 95 percent felt that rewards make employees feel valued.\nAdditionally, 89 percent of survey respondents are very satisfied or satisfied\nwith the impact their programs have on employee engagement; 84 percent are\nvery satisfied or satisfied with the impact on[ employee\nretention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/).\n\nGift card rewards are potent employee favorites. Sixty-nine percent of\nemployee respondents report feeling valued when receiving a gift card from\ntheir employer. They also report that gift cards feel like financial awards\n(69 percent), make them feel like their company cares about them (66 percent),\nincrease their loyalty to their company (56 percent), motivate them to stay\nwith their company (55 percent) and encourage them work harder (54 percent).\n\n**HR News:[Ceridian Extends Innovation Leadership with Intelligent HCM\nSolutions](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/performance-management-\nhcm/ceridian-extends-innovation-leadership-with-intelligent-hcm-solutions/)**\n\nRewards are selected using specific parameters. Of the businesses surveyed, 77\npercent offer reward variety. When deciding which rewards to offer,\nrespondents reported ease of use and convenience as key drivers. Keeping these\nparameters in mind, businesses reported prepaid cards as the most popular go-\nto reward choice, followed by plastic cards and checks.\n\nPersonalization is a missed opportunity. Fewer than one-quarter of reward\nprogram managers surveyed use personalization options like putting their brand\nor brand name on plastic or digital card\u2014missing the opportunity to reinforce\na positive employee interaction with their brand. Additionally, fewer than one\nin five surveyed take advantage of adding a thoughtful touch by including the\nrecipients\u2019 name on gift card rewards.\n\n**HR News:[Talent Solutions Provider ettain group Acquires Global Employment\nSolutions and Leidos's Commercial EHR Consulting\nBusiness](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/recruitment-onboarding/talent-\nsolutions-provider-ettain-group-acquires-global-employment-solutions-and-\nleidoss-commercial-ehr-consulting-business/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Femployee-reward-programs-are-a-must-for-businesses-looking-\nto-retain-top-talent-reveals-blackhawk-network-\nstudy%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Employee+Reward+Programs+Are+a+Must+for+Businesses+Looking+to+Retain+Top+Talent%2C+Reveals+Blackhawk+Network+Study\n\"Share this News on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Employee+Reward+Programs+Are+a+Must+for+Businesses+Looking+to+Retain+Top+Talent%2C+Reveals+Blackhawk+Network+Study&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Femployee-reward-programs-are-a-must-for-businesses-looking-\nto-retain-top-talent-reveals-blackhawk-network-\nstudy%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this News on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Femployee-reward-programs-are-a-must-for-businesses-looking-\nto-retain-top-talent-reveals-blackhawk-network-\nstudy%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this News on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Femployee-reward-programs-are-a-must-for-businesses-looking-\nto-retain-top-talent-reveals-blackhawk-network-\nstudy%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this News on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-email-\nicon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Employee Reward Programs Are a Must for Businesses\nLooking to Retain Top Talent, Reveals Blackhawk Network\nStudy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Frewards-and-\nrecognition%2Femployee-reward-programs-are-a-must-for-businesses-looking-to-\nretain-top-talent-reveals-blackhawk-network-\nstudy%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this News via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Rewards & Recognition ](/category/rewards-and-\nrecognition/ \"Rewards & Recognition\")\n\n  * [ ![How to Retain Top Talent with Employee Recognition: Q&A With Cord Himelstein of Halo Recognition](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/halo_recognition_hr_talk_interview_545_x_240_px_5dc1685b95dbf.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/rewards-and-recognition/cord-himelstein-halo-recognition-top-talent/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How to Retain Top Talent with Employee Recognition: Q&A; With Cord\nHimelstein of Halo Recognition\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/rewards-and-recognition/cord-\nhimelstein-halo-recognition-top-talent/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nCord Himelstein, VP of marketing and communication, Halo Recognition, speaks\nabout how HR needs to approach employee recognition programs and more.\n\nby [Neha Pradhan](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/neha-\npradhan/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Nov 05, 2019\n\n  * [ ![6 Statistics That Confirm Employee Recognition and Retention Are Related](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/statistics_for_employee_recognition_and_retention_5e4e903c0e87c.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-recognition/employee-recognition-and-retention-statistics/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 6 Statistics That Confirm Employee Recognition and Retention Are\nRelated ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-\nrecognition/employee-recognition-and-retention-\nstatistics/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nFor companies looking to strengthen their retention capabilities, an effective\nrecognition program is essential.

In the digital\nage, where the use of big data and analytics have become an important factor\nin determining company success, how can this be the case?\n\nUnfortunately, it is for almost every FTSE company and the vast majority of\nthe global 1000. Reward, which is a large organization\u2019s biggest category of\nexpense, becomes a millstone to bear rather than asset for attracting the best\nand brightest employees.\n\nAll because these organizations do not have the data they need to make better\nbusiness decisions about how they use reward to differentiate themselves.\n\nThis situation must change.\n\nAlso Read: [4 Ways AI is Improving Work-Life\nBalance](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/four-\nways-ai-is-improving-worklife-balance/)\n\n## Understanding reward\n\nReward, is much more than monthly pay. It includes bonuses, pensions, health\ninsurance, benefits, long-term incentives, short-term incentives, share\npurchase schemes and, arguably, holiday time and flexible working. Recognition\npayments and, potentially, skills development, status, and rank are also part\nof the reward cake.\n\nPeople with the same job, grade, and performance rating ought to get the same\nslice of this cake but there is increasing interest amongst employees and\nemployers in personalizing the mix.\n\nIn global firms, this is much harder than it sounds. Reward policies are\nusually managed locally by practitioners who must also take into account local\ntax laws and regulations, including the minimum wage, maximum pension fund\nvalue or benefit-in-kind definitions.\n\nAs a result, companies are managing a set of geo-diverse reward policies that\nare subject to corporate guidelines but have been interpreted and adapted\nlocally. These guidelines are stored in spreadsheets that lack company-wide\nstandardization.\n\nAll of the above means that large corporations struggle to provide employees\nwith an up-to-date statement of their total reward.\n\nAt present, each employee statement needs to be calculated manually. This\nprocess starts with consolidation from separate systems and then involves\nreward rules being applied to calculate a personal total for each individual\nemployee, which is supplied as an annual total reward statement.\n\nThe employer can aggregate this data to create a total reward statement for\nthe whole company, but it will not show the full cost of labor unless they\nalso calculate local factors such as national insurance and employment tax.\n\nThe challenge of extracting the source data from many different systems,\napplying rules and policies and calculating other labor costs is so great that\nthis is currently done typically only once a year. These inadequacies lead to\ntwo huge problems.\n\nFirstly, employees do not fully understand how their package is calculated,\nwhile also undervaluing significant benefits like pensions and healthcare\nbecause they rarely see them stated in monetary terms.\n\nSecondly, employers cannot make decisions of great consequence, such as\nworkforce planning, location planning or delayering, because they do not\nunderstand the full cost of employees.\n\nThis unsatisfactory situation is only tolerated because most organizations see\nno alternative. However, some forward-thinking companies are enabling a\nchange.\n\n## The digitalization of employee rewards\n\nUnilever funded the development of the world\u2019s first Digital Total Rewards\nSystem (DTRS) for a global multinational organization because no such solution\nexisted in the market.\n\nThis replaced the manual process of consolidating spreadsheets with an \u201calways\non\u201d system. It gave employees a real-time view of their total reward and\nemployers a standardized view of employee costs, including tax.\n\nThe system automates the process of extracting, converting and consolidating\nprofile data from its many sources. It then uses a rules engine to apply\nreward policies to calculate totals at the individual employee level.\n\nEmployees can see the full value of Unilever\u2019s investment in their personal\nreward while HR departments can save huge amounts of time and money in manual\nadministration.\n\nHaving this type of system in place allows multinationals to use reward to\ncompete with smaller, more agile businesses. It allows them to attract and\nretain employees based on the broad range of rewards available while letting\nthem personalize them too.\n\nBy combining these twin strategies of digitization and personalization,\ncompanies will be able to improve job satisfaction, organizational commitment,\nand business outcomes. One example of this is being able to address the\nparadox of performance-related pay.\n\n## The relationship between pay and rewards\n\nHow a company allocates reward to a contribution of work is a complex and\ncontroversial area, which is one of the most researched but poorly understood\nareas of social science.\n\nOn one side of the debate, there are\n[studies](https://www.aon.com/unitedkingdom/employee-benefits/benefits-and-\ntrends-survey-2019) that suggest pay alone is not the be all and end all for\nemployees. Other factors, such as purpose, status, recognition, and\ndevelopment, are important but hard to reduce to an economic value.\n\nAgainst this, there is a powerful economic belief that pay is _the_ prime\nmotivator and it should be linked to results. This leads to complex theories\nand mechanisms such as profit-related pay and performance-related pay.\n\nAlthough\n[studies](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/19-050_4d8c1a06-f665-421f-8957-9fa1ac46150f.pdf)\nhave suggested that performance-related pay does have a positive impact on job\nsatisfaction, it\u2019s now widely accepted that individual performance is almost\nalways impossible to measure and attribute fairly across large and complex\norganizations.\n\nTherefore, remuneration is not the only solution that employers should turn to\nwhen rewarding staff. Even when they do, they should be careful about how they\ngo about it.\n\nThis means running experiments that are statistically validated to test their\nreward intervention theories against a control group. In this way, they can\nmake better and more personalized decisions about what the correct pay and\nreward mix is.\n\nEmployees should also play their part in this process. In a world of diverse,\ndistributed workforces where priorities differ markedly from one employee to\nanother, giving individuals the chance to tailor their rewards makes a lot of\nsense.\n\n## Using data to make better decisions\n\nFor such an approach to work, companies need a single dashboard that all\nemployees can access and use to review or amend the choices they make.\n\nHowever, implementing new technology is not enough. A new wave of HR\npractitioners with broad data science skills are also required to ensure that\nthis big data is helping both employees and employers.\n\nHR and reward need to undergo a transformation that involves practitioners\nbecoming comfortable with data and data-driven decision making. In the hands\nof someone with the data science skills to interpret it, data can be the fuel\nthat powers better business decisions.\n\nThis is what we mean when we talk about digitization of rewards bringing\nbetter business outcomes.\n\nAlso Read: [The 3 Pillars of a Successful Relocation\nProgram](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-\nworkforce/the-3-pillars-of-a-successful-relocation-program/)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Fdigitization-of-rewards-leads-to-better-business-\noutcomes%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Digitization+of+Rewards+Leads+To+Better+Business+Outcomes\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Digitization+of+Rewards+Leads+To+Better+Business+Outcomes&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Fdigitization-of-rewards-leads-to-better-business-\noutcomes%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Fdigitization-of-rewards-leads-to-better-business-\noutcomes%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Fdigitization-of-rewards-leads-to-better-business-\noutcomes%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Digitization of Rewards Leads To Better\nBusiness\nOutcomes&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-and-\nrecognition%2Fdigitization-of-rewards-leads-to-better-business-\noutcomes%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Rewards & Recognition ](/category/rewards-and-\nrecognition/ \"Rewards & Recognition\")\n\n  * [ ![How to Retain Top Talent with Employee Recognition: Q&A With Cord Himelstein of Halo Recognition](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/halo_recognition_hr_talk_interview_545_x_240_px_5dc1685b95dbf.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/rewards-and-recognition/cord-himelstein-halo-recognition-top-talent/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How to Retain Top Talent with Employee Recognition: Q&A; With Cord\nHimelstein of Halo Recognition\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/rewards-and-recognition/cord-\nhimelstein-halo-recognition-top-talent/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nCord Himelstein, VP of marketing and communication, Halo Recognition, speaks\nabout how HR needs to approach employee recognition programs and more.\n\nby [Neha Pradhan](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/neha-\npradhan/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Nov 05, 2019\n\n  * [ ![6 Statistics That Confirm Employee Recognition and Retention Are Related](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/statistics_for_employee_recognition_and_retention_5e4e903c0e87c.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-recognition/employee-recognition-and-retention-statistics/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 6 Statistics That Confirm Employee Recognition and Retention Are\nRelated ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-\nrecognition/employee-recognition-and-retention-\nstatistics/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nFor companies looking to strengthen their retention capabilities, an effective\nrecognition program is essential.

employees need to know their work makes a difference, so it's\nimportant for managers to remember to thank their people.\n\nLetting people know their work matters is a great habit that takes a little\nbit of forethought and effort, and doesn\u2019t have to cost a lot.\n\nIt\u2019s really all about keeping them engaged.\n\nA simple \u201cthank you\u201d goes a long way with making people feel valued. The\nreturn on investment is huge for this gesture. These two words can have a\nsignificant impact on motivation and morale.\n\nWhen saying thanks to your good employees, acknowledge the hard work they do,\nand tie it in to how it\u2019s helping your organization meet key goals. This\nreaffirms their work is vital to the company's success.\n\n## Top 4 ways to thank good people\n\nWhen thanking employees, there are several approaches to take.\n\nHere are the most effective:\n\n    * **A hand-written note.** Thank-you notes may sound a bit old-fashioned, but there\u2019s no better way to express gratitude than with a note. Employees will appreciate the gesture, and it provides a personal touch.\n    *  **A face-to-face chat.** Looking employees directly in the eyes and saying \u201cthanks for all you do\u201d is a real motivator that makes them feel valued as people.\n    *  **A phone call.** Can\u2019t talk to them face to face? Take a few minutes to give an employee a call and thank them. Verbal thanks are always appreciated.\n    *  **An email.** If there\u2019s no time to pursue other methods, a quick thanks via email is good way to recognize an employee for a job well done.\n\n## Praise specific efforts\n\nWhen praising employees for their work, be specific. Tell them exactly why the\nwork stands out.\n\nResearch shows simply telling employees they\u2019re doing a \u201cgood job\u201d isn\u2019t\nenough. Reason: They won\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing right, so they won\u2019t work\nto maintain their progress.\n\nInstead, mention what they\u2019ve done well in no uncertain terms.\n\nExample: \u201cYou always hit deadlines.\u201d \u201cYour research is detailed.\u201d \u201cI never\nhave to correct mistakes on reports.\u201d\n\nThis feedback not only makes people feel their work matters, it\u2019ll motivate\nthem to continue performing to top standards \u2013 it\u2019s a win-win for everyone.\n\n## Delivery matters\n\nBesides recognizing employees for specific efforts, managers should also keep\nin mind four other guidelines when it comes to doling out praise:\n\n    * Recognize workers in the moment. It\u2019s best for managers to make note of employee accomplishments as soon as possible. This helps reinforce top performance by acknowledging employees\u2019 good work right as it\u2019s completed.\n    * Keep praise in context. The best way for managers to recognize their employees is to let them know just how their hard work benefits the company\u2019s bottom line. If workers are told that what they do is essential to the company\u2019s success, they\u2019ll feel motivated to keep it up.\n    * Avoid praising work too much or too little. If managers praise their employees enthusiastically for every little thing, the words will lose their meaning \u2013 and their effectiveness. The recognition given should match up appropriately with the employee\u2019s results.\n    * Make the words meaningful. Thanking employees on auto-pilot out of obligation doesn\u2019t promote results. Managers\u2019 words have to be heart-felt and sincere. Inauthentic praise can actually demotivate employees, so praise should be reserved unless they mean it.\n\nIt\u2019s key to note that for these methods to be effective for employee\nrecognition, managers need to promote a culture where workers feel valued in\ngeneral. Everyone should be treated as an essential part of the team.\n\nIf employees feel their managers care about them as people, and don\u2019t just see\nthem as cogs in the machine, praise will be more meaningful to them. Workers\nwho feel valued by managers will be more invested in the company, which\ninspires them to do their best work.\n\n## Give more responsibility\n\nAnother way for employees to feel like they matter is to give them a bit more\nauthority and responsibility as a reward for exceeding expectations.\n\nFeeling challenged by assignments is key to employee satisfaction, as reported\nby over a third (35%) of participants in the CareerBuilder survey.\n\nSo to this end, assign best performers some challenging or interesting tasks.\nLet them have a say in their next assignment. Suggest they mentor or help\ntrain another employee.\n\nOr, allow them to take the lead at the next company meeting or training\nseminar. Stretching a person\u2019s role outside their job description and giving\nthem more responsibilities can be its own reward.\n\nSome managers may even wish to change the person\u2019s job title to better reflect\nhis or her responsibilities and role in the company. With or without a raise,\na more authoritative job title can make an employee feel like his or her work\nis being recognized.\n\nAs another reward, managers can offer to take on their least favoritetask for\none week to get it off their plates. In turn, they can take on a manager\u2019s\ntask and really get an idea of what it\u2019s like to be the person in charge, if\nonly for a day.\n\n## Acknowledge  efforts\n\nWhen rewarding people, it\u2019s a good idea to not only focus on their raw\naccomplishments, but also on the effort it took to get there. After all,\nmanagers want to encourage hard work and innovative thinking, even if the end\nresult wasn\u2019t as planned.\n\nAcknowledging a person\u2019s efforts in pursuing an interesting idea promotes an\nenvironment where employees aren\u2019t afraid to try new things.\n\nThat could pay off in dividends for the company. Also, rewarding loyalty is\nkey to retaining good people. Managers want employees to feel invested in the\ncompany because it encourages them to stick around and continue doing a good\njob.\n\n That\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to celebrate anniversary milestones with the\ncompany.\n\nFor every five years employees spend at their company, recognize the time they\nput in. Hold a special ceremony for these employees, or tie it in to a general\nemployee appreciation celebration. Handing out pins, ribbons or plaques are\nall good ideas.\n\n## Keys to recognition ceremonies\n\nThere are other ways to thank employees that won\u2019t hurt a company\u2019s budget.\nHave a monthly or quarterly recognition ceremony where managers take time out\nto acknowledge the people who have gone the extra mile with their work, and\npresent them with certificates for achievement.\n\nAlthough it doesn\u2019t take much to plan these ceremonies, the ones that are the\nmost effective:\n\n    * **Fit in with the company culture.** If you have a more casual work environment, a black tie gala isn\u2019t the best bet to honor your employees. Consider your culture and work from there.\n    *  **Have specific personal touches.** At many companies, honorees are encouraged to invite guests. And besides work achievements, accomplishments like birthdays and anniversaries are also highlighted.\n    *  **Incorporate unique company elements.** Using a cookie-cutter ceremony likely won\u2019t have an impact on your people. Add some fun and excitement to the festivities. \n\n## The award for 'big thinker' goes to \u2026\n\nOften employers reward their people by naming them \u201cEmployee of the Month\u201d or\n\u201cEmployee of the Quarter.\"\n\nWhile these are great for highlighting general good work, try honoring\nemployees for more specific behaviors to encourage it in the company.\n\nSpecific categories to incorporate include:\n\n    * big thinker\n    * cost-saver\n    * best idea\n    * most hard-working\n    * life saver (complete with a package of the candies).\n    * ultimate team player\n    * mountain mover\n    * Mr. or Ms. Above and Beyond.\n\nEven awards for things like \u201cbest attendance\u201d can encourage positive behavior\nand motivate your people.\n\n![Rich\nHenson](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Rich\nHenson](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Rich\nHenson](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/04/rhensonnewfinal-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Rich Henson](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/rhenson/)\n\nRich Henson, a member of the HRMorning staff, has spent the past two decades\ndeveloping potent HR and Management content that helps guide successful\nleaders forward with confidence.

Alan Heyward, managing director of O.C.\nTanner | accumulate, elaborates\n\n![Employee recognition: An organisational\nimperative](https://us.res.keymedia.com/files/image/oc%20tanner%20\\(1006%20x%20661\\).jpg)\n\n06 Mar 2019\n\nShare\n\n\"Providing a service to customers was relegated to second place. Sales became\nall-important.\"\n\nThe words of Commissioner Kenneth Hayne in handing down the 76 proposed\nreforms contained within the banking royal commission report on 4 February\nformalised what we have all known for some time: widespread cultural\ntransformation across the financial services sector is urgently required to\nrebuild public trust.\n\nWhere once a sales culture prevailed across the sector, in which financial\ntargets were prioritised above, apparently, all else, financial institutions\nare now being compelled to undertake transformational change to create a\nsustainable, service-based culture in which the primary focus is,\nunquestionably, on the needs of the customer.\n\nWhile it is the leaders of these financial institutions that will 'direct'\nthis change and expect their employees to align and connect with a new\norganisational purpose, it is the belief, commitment and effort of those many\nthousands of frontline employees and managers that will dictate the success,\nor otherwise, of the transformation.\n\nIt is here that employee recognition has a critical role to play.\n\n**The power of appreciation**\n\nThe evidence is clear - people who feel appreciated at work are happier, more\nengaged and add greater value than those who don't have that same sense that\nwhat they do matters. The O.C. Tanner Institute's _2018 Global Culture Report_\nvividly illustrates the power of effective recognition in the workplace,\ngenerating among employees a 16% higher sense of personal wellbeing, 24%\nhigher sense of opportunity within the organisation, a 23% higher sense of the\nquality of leadership, and a 20% increase in their connection to purpose.\n\nThe latter point must be uppermost in the minds of decision-makers,\nparticularly when we consider that respondents to the global culture survey\nalso indicated they were 121% more motivated to do their best work when\nrecognition was tied to their organisation's purpose, and only 20% of\nmillennial employees planned to stay for more than five years in companies\nwhere they felt profit came before purpose.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637214460857116193.jpg)](/au/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-worklife-balance/218771)\n\n#### [Fun Friday: 5 TED Talks on work/life\nbalance](/au/specialisation/employee-engagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-\nworklife-balance/218771)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0223_637215104111082460.jpg)](/au/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/how-to-keep-mental-health-on-track-during-remote-working/218895)\n\n#### [How to keep mental health on track during remote\nworking](/au/specialisation/employee-engagement/how-to-keep-mental-health-on-\ntrack-during-remote-working/218895)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637215071772967347.jpg)](/au/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218863)\n\n#### [Awkward 'mistake' on video call goes viral](/au/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218863)\n\nNor can the bottom-line benefits be ignored, as the Global Culture Report\nreveals that purpose-driven companies outperform their peers in share price by\n12 times.\n\nAs financial institutions strive to transform, the ability to create an\nenvironment in which employees know their day-to-day efforts are both noticed\nand valued, and engagement, motivation and discretionary effort can thrive,\nwill surely be one of the foundations on which their new purpose and culture\nare built.\n\n**![](https://us.res.keymedia.com/files/image/more%20flexible%20more%20recognition.PNG)Plenty\nof work to be done**\n\nThe challenge, and conversely the opportunity, for financial institutions -\nand indeed all companies - is that Australia lags behind other key markets\nwhen it comes to employee perceptions of meaningful workplace recognition.\nAustralia ranked 54% on the O.C. Tanner Institute's Global Appreciation Scale\n(alongside the likes of the US, Canada, Japan, Germany) but was slightly\nbehind the UK (57%) and significantly behind India (68%) and China (67%).\n\nSo, the banking royal commission report and the O.C. Tanner Institute's 2018\nGlobal Culture Report are aligned on the direction in which financial\ninstitutions must head if they are to effect culture change on the scale that\nis needed.\n\nEmployee recognition must be at the centre of the conversation. However, that\nconversation has changed significantly in recent times, and for it to have the\ndesired cultural impact, it's important to examine how.\n\n**A more holistic, sophisticated way**\n\nThe people focus of organisations over the past few years has become far more\nholistic and sophisticated, with an organisational lens and data-driven\ndecision-making becoming the norm, rather than the exception.\n\nWhere once there was a focus on 'driving engagement' and reinforcing\nbehaviours that aligned with company values, the conversation has turned -\nsharply and importantly - to building a strong culture by considering the\noverall employee experience and how it aligns with organisational purpose and\nthe customer experience. I've heard more than one HR executive within the\nfinancial services sector talk of their desire to create a \"consumer-grade\nemployee experience\".\n\nThe conversation is essentially now about companies finding ways of connecting\nemployees - with each other, with their accomplishments and roles, and with\nthe company purpose - in an increasingly disconnected world fuelled by a flood\nof new technology and continually changing workforce dynamics.\n\nFewer companies are relying on annual engagement surveys as a reliable\norganisational health check, in favour of more relevant and frequent cultural\nassessments, pulse surveys, and effective one-on-one conversations between\nleaders and their direct reports. The result is a far closer alignment of\nobjectives and expectations with purpose.\n\nThis holistic focus also means that the days of employee recognition being a\nstandalone HR initiative are becoming fewer; for leading companies,\nrecognition is now a strategic organisational imperative with a measurable\nbottom-line return.\n\n**More flexibility, more personalisation, stronger connection**\n\nMany companies continue to scan the market for a recognition platform\nprimarily aimed at a tech-savvy user base, but what are they really paying\nfor? If it is purely a technology buy, the return is likely to be limited.\n\nIt is those companies that are considering the needs of all demographics -\nmaking recognition as relevant and personally meaningful as possible for each\nemployee - that are making the most significant cultural inroads.\n\nNot so long ago, social media channels were flooded with recognition content\nrelated to the rise and rise of the \"entitled, impatient, idealistic\"\nmillennial generation and their expectations around frequent recognition and\nopportunity. Millennials are the dominant workforce segment, so their needs\nare arguably more important now than when the initial hysteria surrounding\ntheir emergence occurred. However, that conversation has also turned sharply -\nthe rise of Generation Z, the first generation of true digital natives with\nrelatively underdeveloped interpersonal skills, is high on the agenda. And\nlet's not forget about the needs of us Gen Xers and baby boomers.\n\nBuilding leadership capability as it relates to recognition and appreciation\nhas also grown in importance. Specific capability is now less a 'nice to have'\nand more a core competency that is integral to the role of every leader in\ndriving culture change.\n\nPut simply, today there is far stronger focus on, and commitment to, helping\npeople thrive at work. The cultural benefits of doing so are clear to see.\n\n**A cautionary tale**\n\nThe cultural issues outlined in the banking royal commission report are not\nunique to the banking and financial services sector. There will be many\norganisations across a multitude of industries that have actively fostered\nsales (rather than service) cultures and are watching the current proceedings\nwith great interest and planning how they can start focusing on the right\nbehaviours as opposed to the right outcomes, to avoid similar levels of\nwithering public and regulatory backlash and scrutiny.\n\nConversely, there will be organisations in that boat who think they have\nnothing to worry about and risk being shredded if they don't at least consider\nstrategic and culture change.\n\nSome financial institutions have been making moves in the right cultural\ndirection for some time; others are starting from a long way back. Whatever\nthe case, when it comes to wholesale culture reform, they could do a lot worse\nthan start with the role employee recognition, done well, can play.\n\n\n\n**_O.C.

In 2018, the flu cost\nU.S. companies $18 billion in lost productivity, reports Gartner. However, a\ndifferent virus has received far more media coverage and is stirring much more\nanxiety: the coronavirus, which has caused a near economic shutdown in China\nand has prompted travelers returning from that country to undergo special\nscreening and possible quarantine.\n\n**The latest:**[ **\u2018Handshake-free\u2019 meetings and other coronavirus\nprecautions**](https://hrexecutive.com/handshake-free-meetings-and-other-\ncoronavirus-precautions/)\n\nAlthough organizations must take precautions to guard their employees from\ncoronavirus, experts are concerned that fear and misinformation could\nultimately land companies in legal jeopardy.\n\nAttorney Bob Nichols, who counseled clients through the SARS virus of 2003 and\nthe H1N1 virus of 2009, says misinformation about coronavirus may be a bigger\nthreat in the U.S. at the moment than the virus itself. So far, only 18 cases\nhave been reported in the U.S., although that number is likely to rise.\n\n\u201cThe [common flu](https://hrexecutive.com/cost-of-the-flu/), which is worse\nthis year than most, is a much more significant threat to U.S. workers than\nthe coronavirus,\u201d says Nichols, a partner at Bracewell LP in Houston. \u201cThe\nmost important thing HR leaders can do is to maintain that perspective and\nguard against over-reaction.\u201d\n\nBy providing employees with accurate information about coronavirus, HR can\nmaintain good order and protect the organization against potential liability,\nhe says. The [Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and the\n[Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/novel_coronavirus/) have good\ninformation on their websites that HR can share with employees to ensure\nthey\u2019re relying on facts, not hearsay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\u201cKeep them aware of the CDC guidance on this topic and that will keep them\ncalm,\u201d says Nichols.\n\nFears about the coronavirus are understandable. As of Monday, the virus has\nkilled more than 900 people in China\u2014including 97 just on Feb. 9\u2014and infected\nmore than 40,000 globally, [reports CNN](https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-\nnews/coronavirus-outbreak-02-10-20-intl-hnk/index.html). Scientists still\naren\u2019t entirely sure how the virus is transmitted and, for now, there is no\nvaccine to guard against it. Government agencies and pharmaceutical companies\nare working to develop a coronavirus vaccine, but it will be months before one\nis ready.\n\nNevertheless, companies shouldn\u2019t allow fear to dictate their response to the\nthreat or rumors to undermine employee morale.\n\n\u201cSo as to avoid the spread of misinformation, HR should endeavor to ensure\nthat employees aren\u2019t sharing false information or gossiping about others,\u201d\nsays Susan Gross Sholinksy, a member of the employment, labor and workforce\nmanagement practice at Epstein Becker Green.\n\nEmployers should also ensure that employees aren\u2019t refusing to interact with\ncolleagues and/or customers who are of Asian descent, she adds. Such behavior\ncould lead to complaints about discrimination based on national origin and\nethnicity, or it could even be \u201cregarded as\u201d disability discrimination.\n\n\u201cRather, any actions taken (or avoided) should be based on whether an\nindividual is likely to have been exposed to the virus,\u201d Gross Sholinsky says.\n\n**\u201cSimple But Important Steps\u201d**\n\nThe blanket media coverage of coronavirus is a good reminder for HR\ndepartments to emphasize preventative steps for guarding the workplace against\nall viruses, says Dr. Teresa Bartlett, senior vice president and medical\ndirector at Sedgwick. It\u2019s especially timely given this season\u2019s virulent flu\noutbreak.\n\nBartlett, who regularly consults with large company clients, says the No. 1\npriority should be reviewing the company\u2019s illness and absence policies and\nreminding employees about them.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want people coming to work sick,\u201d she says. \u201cSet clear guidelines:\n\u2018If you have a cough, a cold, upper-respiratory-illness symptoms, then we\ndon\u2019t want you at work.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen possible, allow people to work from home, says Bartlett.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to have clear guidelines for workplace behavior,\nparticularly during a flu outbreak, she says.\n\n\u201cCounsel employees to consider bumping elbows in lieu of shaking hands,\u201d says\nBartlett. Limit in-person meetings when possible, have hand sanitizer widely\navailable and remind folks to cough into their elbow, not their hand, she\nsays.\n\nCommon surfaces should be sanitized as often as possible, says Bartlett.\n\u201cDoorknobs, elevator buttons, surfaces in the cafeteria\u2014even toilet handles.\nSanitizing these surfaces will go a long way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are simple but important steps,\u201d she adds.\n\n**Lessons from Past Outbreaks**\n\nHR should have a plan ready to deploy should any major outbreak wreak havoc on\ncompany operations, says Bartlett. Such a plan should be created in\npartnership with other departments, including risk management, finance and IT,\nshe says.\n\n\u201cHave something you can easily turn to during times like this,\u201d says Bartlett.\n\nViral outbreaks that occurred earlier this century offer some useful lessons.\nA [recent report from\nGartner](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-questions-for-an-hr-\npandemic-plan/) summarizes the steps taken by companies in the wake of the\nSARS and H1N1 viruses, which also originated in Asia and posed major potential\ndisruptions to the global economy. In the wake of these outbreaks, American\nExpress set up criteria to validate the threats of the next pandemic. It\nincluded both the impact on the business and the impact on the community to\ndetermine \u201cthresholds for action.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nGoodyear focused on having a plan in place to ensure \u201ccritical roles\u201d would be\nmaintained in the event of a pandemic. Each business unit or region was asked\nto identify critical roles. Next, the company organized those roles by\ncategory: essential, temporary suspension and extended suspension (roles that\ncould be suspended without undue harm to the business). Goodyear analyzed its\ntalent bench to determine the difficulty of backfilling essential roles and\nmade adjustments as necessary.\n\n**For China-Based Employees**\n\nOrganizations that have expatriate employees in China or a significant\nworkforce there should carefully monitor travel guidelines to the region, says\nthe Business Group on Health (formerly the National Business Group on Health).\nThe BGH has released [guidelines for\nemployers](https://www.businessgrouphealth.org/topics/blog/the-evolving-\nsituation-of-coronavirus-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont) that have significant\nbusiness in Asia, noting that the U.S. State Dept. has advised against travel\nto China.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Level 4: Do Not Travel\u2019 advisory is the highest level of warning the\nState Department gives for travel,\u201d the BGH notes.\n\nFor companies concerned that an employee was exposed to coronavirus, law firm\nLittler [recommends](https://www.littler.com/publication-\npress/publication/coronavirus-employer-action-items) instructing the employee\nto stay home for up to 14 days to ensure they don\u2019t show symptoms of the\nvirus. The employee should not return to work until they\u2019ve received a\n\u201cfitness-for-duty/return-to-work\u201d notice.\n\nIf an employee has contracted coronavirus, Littler advises contacting the CDC\nand the local health department immediately and having a hazmat company clean\nand disinfect the workplace. Other employees should be notified and the\ncompany should consider allowing employees to expense medical tests for\ndetecting the virus.\n\nCompanies must proceed carefully, taking care to ensure their policies for\ndealing with coronavirus don\u2019t unwittingly discriminate: \u201cIt is possible, and\nindeed likely, that the coronavirus will disproportionately affect members of\na protected class. While the risk of discrimination is likely small, employers\nmust be cognizant of this fact \u2026 .\u201d says Littler.\n\n\u201cEmployers should ensure that employees aren\u2019t improperly creating a hostile\nenvironment for employees of Asian descent due simply to their national origin\nor ethnicity,\u201d says Gross Sholinsky.\n\nAndrew R.

Well done.\u201d_\n\nWhen was the last time your boss said any of those things to you?\n\nWords of praise cost nothing to employers yet have a profound effect on\nemployees.\n\nBut according to a survey by recruiters Hays, 63 per cent of employees don\u2019t\nfeel they get enough praise for their work.\n\nA miserable 8 per cent said they had never received words of approval from\ntheir boss.\n\n\u201cA deliberate \u2018thank you\u2019 increases an employee\u2019s feeling of appreciation by\n116 per cent, spontaneous praise increases it by 172 per cent, while formal\nrecognition increases appreciation by 355 per cent,\u201d says Alexander Lovell of\nemployee recognition solutions company OC Tanner.\n\n\u201cIt is human nature to want others to acknowledge you and value your\ncontributions.\u201d\n\n**The obvious benefits**\n\nPsychologist and high-performance specialist Dr Jo Lukins says recognition of\nstaff is a form of gratitude by organisations.\n\n\u201cThe gratitude research is clear: when we acknowledge, recognise, appreciate\nand savour the contributions of others, we are happier and it enhances\nperformance,\u201d she says.\n\nA recent survey found six out of 10 tech professionals [are\nunhappy](https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2019/it-workers--52--would-not-\nrecommend-their-workplace.html) in their jobs and more than half would not\nrecommend their workplace as a \u2018great place to work\u2019.\n\n\u201cEmployees need to feel respected, empowered and surrounded by positive\nattitudes and behaviours,\u201d says Lincoln Benbow, Director at IT recruiter\nHalcyon Knights.\n\nAcknowledgement and recognition make for happier workers. Happier workers are\nmore engaged.\n\nEngaged workers tend to stay where they are happy.\n\n![](/content/dam/ia/article/images/Katie%20Osborne%20Lincoln%20Benbow%20Alexander%20Lovell%202.jpg)\n\n**Hang onto good staff**\n\nKatie Osborne, General Manager of Project Services and Agile Delivery at\nHalcyon Knights, says businesses should be doing all they can to keep good\ntech staff, given the chronic shortages in the industry.\n\n\u201cHappiness at work is vital for attracting and retaining staff,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIn the current technology recruitment landscape, businesses need every\nadvantage they can get in the war for Aussie tech talent.\u201d\n\nBrad Adams of outsourced human resources company The HR Dept says this\nespecially true for small businesses struggling to compete with the perks\noffered by larger businesses.\n\n\u201cWhere employers in the small and medium business space can match and beat big\ncorporates is in staff retention,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cDeserved and targeted appreciation, for a job well done, is a crucial facet\nin lifting retention rates.\n\n\u201cBest of all, when done well, costs nothing yet delivers significantly to the\nbottom line.\u201d\n\n**From the top**\n\nWhere should recognition come from?\n\nOsborne says it can come from anywhere \u2013 \"whether from the CEO, or colleagues\nnoticing you've gone the extra mile on a project\".\n\n\u201cHowever, arguably, the most critical source is honest appreciation from a\ndirect manager.\u201d\n\nTrudy MacDonald, Managing Director of human resources consultancy TalentCode\nHR, says high performing organisations and leaders prioritise employee\nrecognition as they understand the impact it has on employee retention,\nengagement and discretionary effort.\n\n\u201cAlthough most organisations are striving for a high-performance culture, my\nobservation is that many business leaders do not see the direct connection\nbetween their own behaviour, how well they engage with people, and ultimately\nhow valued and appreciated their employees feel,\u201d she says.\n\n![](/content/dam/ia/article/images/Brad%20Adams%20Jo%20Lukins%20Trudy%20Macdonald%20Monica%20Watt%203.jpg)  \n\n**More than salary**\n\nIf recognition is so important to employees, why are employers resistant to\ngiving kudos when they\u2019re due?\n\nPerhaps bosses believe that because they are paying an employee a salary,\ntheir obligation ends there.\n\n\u201cBeing paid for a job is not recognition,\u201d says Monica Watt, Chief Human\nResources Officer at Elmo Software.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair pay for fair work, and it takes more than a salary to sustain\nemployees to engage, commit or grow within an organisation.\u201d\n\n\u201cA good employee recognition program motivates and empowers employees, in that\nit transforms teams, removes silos, improves processes and productivity, not\nto mention differentiates a business from its competitors.\n\n\u201cWhen applied well, monetary, non-monetary, formal, informal, individual and\nsocial recognition goes a long way to motivating and retaining employees.\n\nLukins explains that for employees to have \u201cmeaningful engagement\u201d with their\nemployer, \u201cthey typically want to be in an organisation that has a positive\nculture; consistency by its leaders; a collaborative team environment; clear\ncommunication; staff supported through technology; and consistency in\nprocesses, expectations and transparency.\u201d\n\nShe adds recognition programs can serve as both an incentive and motivator for\nstaff.\n\n\u201cA positive and grateful culture within an organisation goes a long way\ntowards building harmony and satisfaction amongst staff,\u201d Lukins says.\n\n\u201cThis will increase the likelihood of engagement which has a positive impact\non staff efficiency, productivity and reduces figures like turnover of staff.\u201d\n\n**Recognition**\n\nEmployee recognition is a responsibility of every business, says Watt, as it\u2019s\na key driver in fostering commitment, engagement and connection of an employee\nto the business, to others and fulfils the basic needs of people.\n\nLukins believes it is even more valuable, saying that a recognition program\ndelivered well helps an organisation to reinforce the behaviours, attitudes\nand performances that are synonymous with the company\u2019s values.\n\nOver time, adds MacDonald, the impact on company culture includes accelerated\nemployee growth and development and increased innovation.\n\n\u201cThis occurs as employees grow faster and accept change more readily when they\nare receiving constructive feedback and are encouraged to have a growth\nmindset.\n\n\u201cWhen people feel valued and appreciated, they will more readily share ideas,\ntake risks and engage in solving issues.\n\n\u201cThese are all characteristics of a high-performance culture.\u201d\n\nRecognising and rewarding staff can have a widespread effect throughout a\ncompany.\n\n\u201cWhen recognition is embedded in the culture of a business, there are a number\nof immediate benefits including increased morale and engagement, improved\ntenure and attendance and improved productivity and performance,\u201d says\nMacDonald.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no need to wait until monthly, quarterly, or annual staff awards\nto recognise good work, she adds.\n\n\u201cCreating a culture of recognition means that catching people doing good\nthings, and providing timely, constructive and specific feedback.\u201d\n\n**Why doesn\u2019t my boss say thank you?**\n\nMacDonald says that after working with hundreds of CEOs across all industries,\nher observation is that most CEOs do appreciate their people however either\n\u201cdon\u2019t think to tell them or don\u2019t have the discipline to stop what they are\ndoing and make the effort to have the conversation.\u201d\n\nShe adds many CEOs are intrinsically motivated and don\u2019t seek recognition from\nothers.\n\n\u201cIt is often lonely at the top and the opportunity to receive external\nrecognition is limited.\n\n\u201cAs a result, many CEOs hold that belief that if they don\u2019t need recognition,\nthen others don\u2019t need it either.\u201d\n\n![](/content/dam/ia/article/images/2%20ry%20roulla%20yiacoumi%20headshot%20purple%20news%20small%202.jpg)\n\nRoulla Yiacoumi [![Twitter](/etc/designs/ia/clientlib-all/Images/twitter-\nicon.png)](https://twitter.com/roulla)\n\n**Roulla Yiacoumi** is the Managing Editor of _Information Age_.

How can organizations align themselves better to technology that\nwill affect incentive frameworks in the future?_**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834bf8d52f2.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nWhile the work ecosystem may be dynamic and evolving at a speed that is often\nhard to keep pace with, certain aspects of work do not change. The concept of\nemployee rewards and recognition is one such unchanging aspect that never\nloses significance despite the blitzkrieg of changes around it.\n\nThe systems and processes of rewarding and recognizing employees may undergo\nsome minor (as well as drastic) modification, there may be ample debate on the\nbest practices to follow when it comes to rewarding the people at work and HR\nteams across geographies and sectors may be utterly divided in their approach\nto recognizing their human resources. That said, employees will never stop\nexpecting to be rewarded and recognized for their work and organizations will\nalways try to come up with ways to live up to these expectations.\n\n**Also Read** : **** **[20 Memorable Employee Appreciation Day Ideas for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/20-memorable-employee-appreciation-day-ideas-for-2020/)**\n\nThis mutually accepted transaction cycle has been around since the first\nemployer-employee agreement and it is thus safe to assume that no matter the\nchanges that inform the world of work, this cycle would continue into the\nfuture.\n\n## Reward, Recognize, Engage\n\nThe system of rewards and recognition has undergone quite visible changes over\nthe last decade. It has also been visible that the right R&R; has the power to\ndrive employee engagement and elevate the employee experience. The target\naudience at the workplace has changed and the present employee has very\ndifferent needs, desires, and goals than the previous work generations.\n\nWhat has not changed though is the fact that incentives, rewards and\nrecognition sculpt the perception an employee has of the organization that\nthey works with. The timeless trend of rewarding employees for a job well done\nand recognizing their contribution has evolved. From being primarily cash or\nbonus-centric to becoming a lot less tangible and often without a direct\nfinancial note to it, today rewards can range from Amazon vouchers to paid\nholidays to a Netflix or gym subscription. The point is to create, within\nrewards and recognition schemes, another channel through which the\norganization can communicate and engage with an employee in a format that is\nmost relatable at the individual level.\n\n**Also Read:** **[What Is Employee Appreciation? Definition, Strategies, and\nIdeas, With Examples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-appreciation-definition-strategies-ideas/)**\n\nUsing R&R; as an employee engagement tool demands a technological leap. Means\nand ways of engaging employees (should) have evolved with changes in how we\ncommunicate and the extent to which tech has pervaded every aspect of our\nfunctioning.\n\nAI today is quickly becoming more than a phase and a fad \u2013 it is becoming the\nnorm. Organizations thus need to weave in the AI wave into the tide of change\nthat is sweeping over the HR landscape in general and rewards, recognition and\nincentive frameworks in specific.\n\n## The Rewards of AI \u2013 3 ways AI will Impact Rewards and Recognition\n\nWhile bearing in mind the context that R&R; would always be in vogue, let\u2019s\npause for a moment to regard what Artificial Intelligence (AI) has brought to\nthe table of rewards and recognition and how AI solutions will continue to\nimpact R&R.;\n\n## 1\\. Personalization v/s individualization\n\nThe workplace is multigenerational and dynamic. The expectations from employee\nexperience has changed because just as external customers want brand\ncommunications and offerings to speak to them, so do internal customers\n(employees). AI tools in the guise of friendly chatbots, collaborative robots,\nand even AI teamwork enablers allow deep data mining to make rewards and\nrecognition formats not just personalized but individualized \u2013 where they make\nsense to every employee. AI has also and will continue to modify R&R; to make\nis continued, sustainable, informal and relevant. Even when it comes to simple\nprocesses of recognizing an employee across diverse, geographically spread out\nteams, AI tools can enable and uplift communication.\n\nThus, AI will allow the shift from generalization to personalization and\nfinally to individualization of rewards and recognition. This will, in turn,\nenhance the employee experience, improve engagement and create a culture at\nwork where employees feel valued as individuals.\n\n**Also Read:[Employee Appreciation Day Exclusive: 4 Ways Technology Can\nAmplify Your Rewards and Recognition\nPrograms](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-\nrecognition/employee-appreciation-day-exclusive-4-ways-technology-can-amplify-\nyour-rewards-and-recognition-programs/)**\n\n## 2\\. Meeting expectations v/s delivering happiness\n\nAI is changing the game with gamification even when it comes to rewards and\nrecognition. This will no longer be a mundane checklist that organizations go\nthrough as a compulsion after performance appraisals. With augmented reality\nchanging how work appraisals work, rewards and recognition trends are changing\nas well. The idea is no longer being able to meet employee expectations but to\npromote happiness at work. That is a retention strategy that AI is looking\nthrough to fruition.\n\nAI also allows the inclusion of the fun quotient in a lot of otherwise\nmonotonous aspects of work. The ability of organizations to exceed employee\nexpectations with technology is important when it comes to retaining talent\nand making them feel that the organization cares. AI tools have the power to\nbe a lot more engaging and to help R&R; make the shift from catering to\nemployee satisfaction to powering employee happiness.\n\n## 3\\. Prescriptive v/s predictive\n\nAI and similar new-age technology will make HR processes a lot more engaging.\nWith employee rewards and recognition too, the shift would be from the\ninherently reactive and prescriptive approach to making appreciation programs\na lot more perceptive, proactive and predictive. With AI and engaging,\nimmersive tools, the idea is to bank on data and create experiences that are\nvaluable.\n\nPredictive analytics coupled with AI would also help in projecting future\ntrends in rewards and recognition and understanding how future generations at\nwork would want to be appreciated.\n\n**A Culture of Appreciation with AI**\n\nWith our technological progress and prowess, it is often difficult to\ndifferentiate between disruptive and destructive trends. It is thus often best\nto take a step back and appraise trends before plunging head first into\ndelusional disruption. Likewise with R&R; trends on the rise now. While\norganizations do need to keep up and step up, HR teams need to plan progress\nin a way that the organization stays true to the culture it wants to promote\nand propagate.\n\nAs AI makes rewards and recognition predictive, individualized and happiness-\ncentric, the core thought needs to remain creating a culture of honest\nappreciation \u2013 a workplace where employees feel valued and motivated. AI tools\nalso have the ability to create more transparent metrics to make appreciation\nschemes and tools a more open conversation. There are tools that allow\nemployees to participate in nominating and selecting their colleagues who\ndeserve a pat on the back. Organizations preparing to upgrade their employee\nrewards and recognition practices need to do so keeping in mind the upcoming\nkey trends and the employer brand they wish to promote.\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F3-ways-ai-will-impact-employee-rewards-and-\nrecognition%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=3+Ways+AI+will+Impact+Employee+Rewards+and+Recognition\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=3+Ways+AI+will+Impact+Employee+Rewards+and+Recognition&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F3-ways-ai-will-impact-employee-rewards-and-\nrecognition%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F3-ways-ai-will-impact-employee-rewards-and-\nrecognition%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F3-ways-ai-will-impact-employee-rewards-and-\nrecognition%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=3 Ways AI will Impact Employee Rewards and\nRecognition&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F3-ways-ai-will-impact-employee-rewards-and-\nrecognition%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Digital Transformation ](/category/digital-\ntransformation/ \"Digital Transformation\")\n\n  * [ ![Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/shutterstock_1134410339_5db306fad1860.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-special-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-\nspecial-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe future of work is uncertain, and the fear of AI taking over work is real.\nBut there\u2019s more to it, as expressed by some HR leaders we spoke to.\n\nby [Puja Lalwani](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/puja-\nlalwani-1/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Oct 25, 2019\n\n  * [ ![How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process \\(and How It Won\u2019t\\)](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/ai_in_recruitment_5da994c5c9d8b.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-and-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-wont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process (and How It Won\u2019t)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-\nand-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-\nwont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nWe hear a lot about AI\u2019s effect on jobs, but what about its effect on\nrecruiters?

As the gap between business needs\nand skilled candidates continues to widen, HR leaders are redefining the\n\u201cideal candidate\u201d for their midsize businesses \u2013 beyond the traditional triad\nof college degrees, industry experience, and workplace compatibility.\n\nSuch a reassessment can become a transformational moment in how growing\nbusinesses adjust their workforce to the changing nature of work. During the\nWebinar, \u201c[Winning in the 2020s: Six Trends Every Midsize Needs to\nKnow](https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2020/02/72e64422-867d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html?campaigncode=CRM-\nYM20-CON-20WEBI3&source=email-glo-Forbes-032520-SkillGaps-\nsocialnuture-2020Trends\n\"https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2020/02/72e64422-867d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html?campaigncode=CRM-\nYM20-CON-20WEBI3&source=email-glo-Forbes-032520-SkillGaps-\nsocialnuture-2020Trends\") _,\u201d Shari Lava, Research Director Small and Medium\nBusiness at IDC_ _,_ shared that more than 40% of midsize companies are poised\nto take advantage of this opportunity within the next two years by defining\nnew sourcing strategies and goals.*\n\n**Knowing the difference between skill-gap need and skill-building**\n\nCommon wisdom tells businesses that a solid market plan makes it easier to\nspot the skills that are needed to deliver expected outcomes. But\nunfortunately for most midsize companies, the reality of spotting gaps among\ntheir talent is not necessarily so straightforward, according to IDC research.\nIn fact, the 40% that is actively addressing it know which skill gaps are\ncritical. Meanwhile, the remaining 60% is still trying to figure out which\nskill are pivotal, let alone put a plan in place to bridge the most important\ngaps.\n\nA midsize company\u2019s ability to evaluate their skill gap holistically can vary\ndramatically, depending on their industry and the competitive nature of their\nmarketplace. For example, a business facing competition that evolves\norganically and incrementally typically has a more solid foundation of skills\nalready available and a better line of sight into new needs coming their way.\nBut if the company is experiencing significant threats from disruption, the\nrange of missing skills grows exponentially, which is more challenging to\nstrategically determine which areas should be tackled first and in which\norder.\n\nMidsize companies that take an in-depth look at what\u2019s happening in their\nworkforce often realize that an incremental strategy is not enough. They also\nneed a recruiting approach focused on hiring candidates with [power\nskills](https://joshbersin.com/2019/10/lets-stop-talking-about-soft-skills-\ntheyre-power-skills/ \"https://joshbersin.com/2019/10/lets-stop-talking-about-\nsoft-skills-theyre-power-skills/\") such as effective communication in a\nbusiness context, innovative thinking, curiosity, creativity, and adaptability\nin times of continuous change. Furthermore, new hires should view business\nneeds through the lens of customer empathy and look to resolve them with\nagility, collaboration, and teamwork.\n\nIn times of disruption and accelerating business challenges, businesses need\nto adapt quickly and efficiently to leverage these opportunities and more to\ngrow. By choosing technologies that can evolve with changing workforce skills,\nemployee behaviors, and business processes, midsize companies can shape their\nfuture with the right strategies for the sourcing, development, reward, and\nrecognition of talent. They can even build a business culture of continuous\nlearning, agile action, and adaptability.\n\nTake, for example, robotic process automation and artificial intelligence.\nThese technologies are particularly interesting for business areas with\nprocesses that are repetitive or require the ability to understand and discern\npatterns immediately to make decisions, trigger action, or innovate new\nproducts and services.\n\nAccelerated up-skilling can help support and maximize the potential of\ntechnology-driven advantages with capabilities such as:\n\n  * Real-time access to customer sentiment and employee feedback to solve otherwise hidden issues and identify opportunities \n  * Rapid feedback loops beyond the employee culture to identify and remove roadblocks to new business opportunities as well as refine and speed up business processes, such as the delivery of HR tasks and operational activities\n  * Faster innovation cycles, product delivery, and removal of process and system bottlenecks \n  * Distributed workforce that is flexible and connected enough to create cutting-edge opportunities and a globally aligned and collaborative workforce culture\n\n**Valuing adaptability as the next big skill**\n\nSo, which is more important: personality or specific business skills?\n\nSeparately, each factor can only get the business as far as the horizon. When\ncombined, they can help the company reach edges that cannot be seen today,\nresponding to demand for new types of skills at an accelerated pace.\n\nTo get ahead of the skills gap, midsize businesses need to go beyond just\nsurveying current and future organizational needs on a position-by-position\nbasis and determining which skills are becoming outdated. What\u2019s needed is a\nworkforce that is adaptable enough to resolve the business problems of the\nfuture \u2013 in real time \u2013 for the next two months, as well as the next ten\nyears.\n\n_Listen to an excerpt of our Webinar, \u201c_[ _Winning in the 2020s: Six Trends\nEvery Midsize Needs to\nKnow_](https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2020/02/72e64422-867d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html?campaigncode=CRM-\nYM20-CON-20WEBI3&source=email-glo-Forbes-032520-SkillGaps-\nsocialnuture-2020Trends\n\"https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2020/02/72e64422-867d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html?campaigncode=CRM-\nYM20-CON-20WEBI3&source=email-glo-Forbes-032520-SkillGaps-\nsocialnuture-2020Trends\")[,\u201d](https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2020/02/72e64422-867d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html?campaigncode=CRM-\nYM20-CON-20WEBI3&source=email-glo-Forbes-032520-SkillGaps-\nsocialnuture-2020Trends\n\"https://www.sap.com/assetdetail/2020/02/72e64422-867d-0010-87a3-c30de2ffd8ff.html?campaigncode=CRM-\nYM20-CON-20WEBI3&source=email-glo-Forbes-032520-SkillGaps-\nsocialnuture-2020Trends\") _with Timo Elliott, Global Innovation Evangelist\nfrom SAP and guest speaker Shari Lava, Research Director Small and Medium\nBusiness at IDC._\n\n[![SAP](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/assets/images/avatars/blog-1194_400_213caf45ea19d264d0215f602738fdf9.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/\n\"Photo of SAP\")\n\n[SAP](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/)\n\nSAP is the world\u2019s leading provider of business software \u2013 enterprise resource\nplanning, business intelligence, and related applications and services that\nhelp companies\u2026\n\n Read More\n\nSAP is the world\u2019s leading provider of business software \u2013 enterprise resource\nplanning, business intelligence, and related applications and services that\nhelp companies of all sizes and in more than 25 industries run better.

Only 29% of employees say that HR understands what they need in the\nworkplace, meaning employee experience needs to be a significant focus area\nfor HR professionals.\n\nAs you look at leveraging your workforce and increasing productivity, you need\nan intelligent framework for employee experience management. Let\u2019s take a look\nat a few practical strategies in this space.\n\n## **Table of Contents**\n\n  * **What Is Employee Experience?**\n  * **5 Workplaces With a Great Employee Experience Strategy and Lessons for HR**\n  * **Getting Started With Employee Experience Management**\n  * **The Next Step? Use These 4 Platforms to Streamline the Employee Experience at Your Company**\n\n## **What Is Employee Experience?**\n\nEmployee experience has two facets.\n\nFirst, it refers to the emotional response felt by an employee due to multiple\nworkplace processes. This could range from their **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/),\n[onboarding experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/)**, the digital\ntools available for them to do their jobs, training opportunities, ease of\naccessing benefits, and timely payment, right up to the final\noffboarding/outplacement stage.\n\nSecond, it also comprises a worker\u2019s observations about the company that they\nare going to share with friends and family. If you deliver a poor employee\nexperience at your workplace, workers will talk to their professional network\nabout it, hurting the employer brand and reducing the chances of referrals.\nIt\u2019s no surprise, therefore, that the world\u2019s most coveted workplaces like\nGoogle or Salesforce also have a stellar employee experience management\nstrategy.\n\nBut it\u2019s also important to note that no two employees in the same workplace\nwill report having the same experience. The following five variables will\ncontribute to this metric:\n\n![Five key factors that contribute to overall employee\nexperience](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. Five key factors that contribute to overall employee experience**\n\n### **1\\. The employee persona**\n\n  \nJust like a predefined buyer persona affects the customer experience, the\npersona of your employees will determine the quality of experience in the\nworkplace. It is advisable to create detailed employee personas before you\nstart outlining a framework for employee experience management. That way, you\ncan match every employee with the appropriate experience design and establish\nachievable goals.\n\n### **2\\. Your diversity and inclusion stance**\n\n  \nThe level of inclusivity your company practices will shape the nature of the\nworkplace experience. Studies prove that there is a significant gap in **[job\nsatisfaction](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/job-\nsatisfaction-definition-factors-importance-statistics-examples/)** between\nmale and female professionals. As a result, your workplace will be experienced\ndifferently by individuals of varying genders, ethnicities, and generations.\n\n### **3\\. The job role**\n\n  \nThe various aspects of the job role are essential factors contributing to the\nemployee experience. High-pressure jobs with daily targets will create a\nvastly different experience than a more senior role, requiring strategic\ndecision-making duties. That's why delivering a positive employee experience\n(regardless of job role) requires a highly personalized experience framework.\nThat would balance the seemingly negative aspects of the job (e.g., the\npressure of delivering daily targets) with more positive elements (e.g.,\nrecognition of a job well done or paid vacation days).\n\n### **4\\. The employee\u2019s immediate manager**\n\n  \nThis is a game-changing differentiator for employees, as a bad manager could\neven drive up your employee attrition rate. Not every manager will have the\nsame level or type of leadership skills, making it essential to collect\nregular feedback from employees on manager performance. In some instances, you\ncould even reassign an employee to another team or manager if their\npersonalities are entirely out of sync.\n\n### **5\\. Compensation and benefits**\n\n  \nAn employee enjoying competitive pay, along with an attractive benefits\npackage, is more likely to report a positive experience. Do keep in mind that\nthis may not be the only factor contributing to the experience. In contrast,\nan external worker who isn\u2019t eligible for the same benefits as those on the\ncompany payroll may not be equally satisfied. You can try to address these\nvariances with an employee experience management strategy that factors in all\ntypes of workers.\n\nThese are five variable factors that could influence employee experiences\nacross your company. Apart from this, several static factors affecting\nemployee experience are more in your control. These include flexibility of\nhours, equal opportunities at work, employee development plans, employee\nrecognition programs, healthy internal communication, and a positive,\ntransparent, and inclusive company culture as a whole.\n\nClearly, employee experience is multi-dimensional, far greater than the sum of\nits parts!\n\nSo how can you leverage these factors and deliver the best possible experience\nto your employees? Here are five effective strategies, with examples.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Employee Engagement vs. Job Satisfaction: Key Differences\nand Metrics**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-engagement-vs-job-satisfaction-differences/)\n\n## **5 Workplaces With a Great Employee Experience Strategy and Lessons for\nHR**\n\nThere\u2019s no one failproof strategy to manage the employee experience. Depending\non where you're situated, your workforce demographics, and the core business,\nyou need to identify exactly what motivates and delights your employees. This\nmeans figuring out emotional triggers, performance drivers, and common pain\npoints in the workplace, and making employee experience culturally relevant in\nthe workplace.\n\nThe five companies listed here achieved this with their unique frameworks for\nemployee experience management:\n\n### **1\\. Treat your employees like \u201cfamily\u201d**\n\n  \n_For example, The Cheesecake Factory._\n\nThe average number of hours spent at the office is continually increasing. It\nis vital that during this time, employees feel a sense of belonging and\ncommunity at work. They shouldn\u2019t just be clocking in, doing their job, and\nclocking out. Positive employee experience will include emotional rewards for\ncoming into the office every day, apart from the salaries and benefits earned.\n\nThe Cheesecake Factory is mainly focused on this aspect of employee experience\nmanagement. The company holds continuous training programs, maintaining\nconsistency across 220+ locations. It also has a \u201cWow Stories\u201d initiative that\nshares instances of employee success with everyone in the organization. 94% of\nworkers say they are made to feel welcome at the time of joining, and 90% say\nthey are treated as full members, regardless of their position.\n\nBecause of its efforts to enhance employee experience, [The Cheesecake Factory\nwas named #25](https://www.greatplacetowork.com/certified-company/1100151)\namong the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For in 2019.\n\n### **2\\. Give customer experience and employee experience equal importance**\n\n  \n_For example, Sephora._\n\nThe concept of employee experience is taken from the marketer\u2019s playbook,\nwhere employee experience is thought of as a product. Just as an enriching\ncustomer experience increases the chance of conversion and repeat sales,\nbetter employee experience has a similar impact on your workforce. It leads to\nsatisfied employees who are more productive, comfortable to retain, and likely\nto refer others.\n\nTake a leaf out of Sephora\u2019s employee experience strategy. The company\ncollects data on both employee and customer experience, using analytics to\nconnect the two. Based on the insights, Sephora then brings in an element of\npersonalization, removing barriers to work, enabling a sense of \u201cfun,\u201d and\nreinforcing its corporate social responsibility.\n\nThe data also highlights how better employee experience has directly impacted\ncustomer interactions, making these employees prime candidates for a show of\nappreciation.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How to Engage Employees in 2020: 10 Impactful\nSolutions**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-\nto-engage-employees-impactful-solutions/)\n\n### **3\\. Ensure that culture is the cornerstone of your business**\n\n  \n_For example, Salesforce._\n\nCulture is a key determining factor for employee experience quality. Without\nyour cultural values clearly outlined, the employee experience will be\ninconsistent. This is particularly true if you have a large, distributed\nworkforce. Give tangible labels to your cultural values and make sure that\nthese values are reflected in the way you do business. Over time, these values\nwill percolate through both the employee and customer experience.\n\nAt Salesforce, employees are aware of a clear set of values: \u201cTrust, Customer\nSuccess, Innovation, Giving Back, Equality, Wellness, Transparency, and Fun.\u201d\nThis is encapsulated in the company\u2019s \u201cOhana\u201d spirit, something that\u2019s been\naround its early days in 1999. Ohana creates a community of employees,\npartners, customers, and alumni, where everyone helps each other out.\n\nOn the business side of things, Ohana has inspired the 1:1:1 philanthropic\nmodel where 1% of Salesforce\u2019s software, company equity, and employee time is\ndonated for charitable purposes.\n\n### **4\\. Make your employees\u2019 priorities your priorities**\n\n  \n_For example, Starbucks._\n\nAn employee\u2019s personal goals, ambitions, and challenges can also influence how\nthey experience your workplace. For instance, a young parent worried about\nchildcare or a fresh graduate with student debt will struggle to achieve\noptimal productivity at work. You can address this by aligning your benefits\nto employee priorities, ensuring they receive a positive experience from being\npart of your company.\n\n[At Starbucks](https://www.wayup.com/guide/community/13-things-you-didnt-know-\nabout-working-for-starbucks/), this takes the shape of student-specific\nemployee benefits. 70% of Starbucks employees are either students or aspiring\nto re-enter education. The company offers full tuition coverage wherever\npossible through partnerships with local universities. There\u2019s an enrollment\ncounselor to guide students through the joining process.\n\nBasics such as food and drink are also covered, with one free item for every\nshift.\n\n### **5\\. Leverage data to address gaps in your employee experience**\n\n  \n_For example, Google._\n\nNo matter how hard you try, there\u2019s sure to be a few gaps or missing links in\nyour employee experience strategy. Regular data collection and analysis can\nhelp detect these before they become a significant pain point. You can\nleverage employee experience surveys, in combination with advanced analytics\nto pinpoint actionable insights.\n\nGoogle has always been known for its exceptional employee experience \u2013 this is\nthanks to its proactive stance. At one time, anecdotal evidence suggested that\nthere was a disproportionate number of women leaving the company. Using\nanalytics, Google realized that it was new mothers who were deciding to quit.\n\nThe company increased its maternity leave from 12 weeks to five months,\ntransforming how this demographic experienced the workplace. As a result,\n**[attrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-attrition-complete-guide/)** among women came down by 50%.\n\n**Getting Started With Employee Experience Management**\n\nTraditionally, employee experience has fallen under the scope of HR, with HR\npractitioners devising strategies for better experiences at work. However, as\nthis becomes a top priority for companies, we are now witnessing new jobs\ndedicated to employee experience management.\n\nThese statistics from [Deloitte\u2019s 2019 Global Human Capital\nTrends](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-\ntrends/2019/workforce-engagement-employee-experience.html) suggest why you\nmight need an employee experience management team in 2020:\n\n  * Employee experience was among the top three issues HR faced in 2019, according to 28% of respondents. Another 84% said that it was a priority.\n  * Companies on the top quartile of employee experience witness twice the degree of customer satisfaction, double the innovation readiness, and 25% more profits than companies in the bottom quartile.\n  * Despite these trends, only 9% of respondents said that they were \u201cvery ready\u201d to address the issue.\n\nThese events have given rise to new jobs such as \u201cEmployee Experience Manager\u201d\nand \u201cChief Employee Experience Officer.\u201d For example, a global leading\nhospitality pioneer, Airbnb, has a Global Head of Employee Experience who is\nin charge of maintaining company values and ethics across its many workplaces\nin the world.\n\n\u201cAt Airbnb we are focused on bringing to life our mission of creating a world\nwhere you can #belonganywhere, by creating memorable workplace experiences\nwhich span all aspects of how we relate to employees, including how we recruit\nthem, develop them, the work environment we create with them, the type of\nvolunteer experiences we offer them, and the food we share together,\u201d [said\nMark Levy, global head of employee experience at\nAirbnb](https://blessingwhite.com/airbnb-chief-human-resource-officer-becomes-\nchief-employee-experience-officer/), commenting on what employee experience\nmeans for the company.\n\nIn a single sentence, you could define employee experience management as a\nwell-defined pan-organizational strategy, designed to deliver positive\nworkplace experiences \u2013 with an eye on employee well-being as well as the\nbusiness bottom line.\n\nBut, even if you don\u2019t have a specialized employee experience function just\nyet, there are several platforms you can use to make sure your employees enjoy\ncoming to work, derive value from what they do, and are motivated to put in\ntheir best. These platforms, as [analyst Josh Bersin put\nit](https://joshbersin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/EXP_Whitepaper_v4.pdf),\nare called employee experience platforms (EXP).\n\n## **The Next Step? Use These 4 Platforms to Streamline Employee Experiences\nat Your Company**\n\nMeasuring the many intangible aspects of employee experience can be difficult.\nThat\u2019s why you need an intelligent tool that will collect data, give you\ninsights, streamline communication, and make positive action simpler. Here are\nour recommendations for 2020:\n\n### **1.** [**Workvine**](https://www.workvine.co.uk/employee-experience/)\n\n  \nThis is an end-to-end EXP, encompassing communication, training, feedback,\nprivate chats, surveys, and company-wide updates. It brings all of the\ninteractions that employees are likely to have across their professional\njourneys under one roof.\n\n### **2.**[ **Qualtrics**](https://www.qualtrics.com/au/employee-\nexperience/?rid=ip&prevsite=uk&newsite=au&geo=IN&geomatch=au)\n\n  \nThe company\u2019s EXP called Employee XM is a tool meant specifically for\ncollecting data and generating actionable insights. You can conduct surveys on\nengagement, training, onboarding, benefits, and offboarding \u2013 covering all the\nmajor touchpoints on the employee journey.\n\n### **3.**[ **Staffbase**](https://staffbase.com/en/)\n\n  \nThis EXP integrates all the tools an average employee uses every day. There\nare communication and survey tools, collaboration capabilities like document\nmanagement, employee self-service, recognition & rewards, and onboarding\nmanagement, among others.\n\n### **4.**[ **Medallia**](https://www.medallia.com/employee-experience/)\n\n  \nMedallia breaks down the employee lifecycle into key moments, soliciting\nscores and feedback across these areas. Using the data collected, you can make\nsmarter decisions on employee experience \u2013 or you can leverage the insights\ngained for customer experience enhancement as well.\n\nEquipped with the definition of employee experience and viable strategies for\nyour company, you can now take a call about whether you need an employee\nexperience manager in 2020, or if an EXP would suffice.

With the virus outbreak now\nreaching over 189 countries and affecting more than 730 000 people, the\nconcern around employee safety and health has gained paramount importance.\n\nOrganisations are already suspending finger/thumb-based biometric attendance.\nMost organisations are also moving away from swipe card-based attendance as\nit's equally unsafe. (We may at least wash our hands but never sanitise swipe\ncards as they are kept at all surfaces.)\n\nThe innocent-looking door handle/knobs seem to be the biggest source of\ninfection spread. Most organisations are looking for an effective **pandemic\ncontrol system** that can identify/isolate only the infected employee to drive\nemployee wellness and resume normalcy.\n\nOur partner, Ramco Systems, recently unveiled an advanced facial recognition-\nbased attendance system \u2013 RamcoGEEK, embedded with temperature recording that\ncan integrate with IOT sensor doors to enable organisations to move towards\n\u2018touch-less\u2019 attendance and workplace access, in the wake of the COVID-19\noutbreak.\n\nCombined with a thermal imaging device for temperature measurement, it enables\norganisations to track staff or visitors with high temperatures that may\nindicate infection and build in operating procedures to avoid further spread\nof infection within enclosed spaces,creating a healthy workplace.\n\n **RamcoGEEK for Attendance with Temperature Capturing can:**\n\n  * Detect and match the faces of staff members and mark their attendance along with temperature.\n  * System is linked to an IOT sensor-powered door which can restrict access in case the temperature is higher than normal and auto apply for leave on behalf of the employee.\n  * Communicate the information to HR and management in real-time.\n  * Track the movements of a high-temperature employee/person on the premises.\n  * Send notifications/alerts to all those employees, customers, vendors and others who interacted with in-person, in the event any person develops COVID-19 symptoms or is diagnosed.\n\nIn addition, you can implement a contact tracing chatbot which enables the\norganisation to trace the contacts around an infected employee or reverse\ntrace based on publicly available information to contain further spread.\n\nKeen to explore?

The two components\nneed to work hand in hand to achieve the right level of motivation and\nengagement.\u201d\n\nAgreeing with this sentiment was **Darien Mah, Chief Executive Officer of\nFOREFRONT International (Malaysia)** , who helms the rewards and recognition\ninitiatives in the organisation. He says: \u201cKeeping employees motivated is a\nfine balancing act that all companies strive to excel. In the shorter term,\nrewards give a quick boost to productivity. In the longer term, recognition\nhas proven to be an important component of our retention strategy.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, on her personal experience, **Leah Donovan, an Australia-based\nsenior HR executive with 18 years of experience** , says: \u201cRewards and\nrecognition are so interlinked. For example, money (salary) is a reward in the\nsense that you are giving your employee something of value for doing a job. At\nthe same time, you are also recognising them by paying them what the job is\nworth in the market.\u201d Having established that both rewards and recognition are\nneeded to successfully drive employee engagement and motivation, we speak to\norganisations that have mastered this two-pronged approach.\n\n### Beam Suntory\n\nTo **Ilja Rijnen, Emerging Asia HR Director for Beam Suntory** , while\nstrategically used rewards can drive performance and retention, it won\u2019t drive\n(longer term) engagement or efficiency in working. Whereas recognition, if\ndone authentically and timely, can have a prolonged impact on motivation,\nperformance and engagement.\n\nWith an ambition to be the fastest growing and most respected spirits company,\nBeam Suntory makes use of both rewards and recognition to engage and motivate\nstaff.\n\n\u201cIn order to live our ambition we need to be bold in our talent development\nand recognise great breakthrough achievements. We call this \u201cYatte Minahare!\u201d\n(go for it) and we stimulate our people to do things differently while always\nprioritising compliance and doing business the right way in line with our\nvalues and culture.\u201d\n\nThe company has regular communication and awards on \u201cYatte Minahare\u201d and\nachievements are celebrated.\n\n> ##### To reward for performance, Beam Suntory uses a clearly defined\n> leadership and behavioural framework as well as leadership assessments to\n> identify top performers based on what they deliver (50%), as well as on how\n> they had done it (50%).\n\n\u201cRewards are tied to this - monetary in the form of a fair performance reward\nsystem and great secondary benefits, including a great work climate, office\nbar, voluntary leave and good medical benefits,\u201d Rijnen says, adding that\nthose are the basics in place for all staff.\n\nWhere the differentiation starts between the core employees and top performers\nis through the partnerships it builds between top performers and the\nindividuals in terms of development where various development programmes are\nin place for (aspiring) leaders and functional talent.\n\nRijnen says: \u201cWe believe that development has to be mutual and a win-win.\nThere has to be ownership by each party, it has to be performance and how\nfocused, it has to be long term beneficial for both parties.\u201d\n\nBeing part of the Suntory Group, Beam Suntory can offer people places within\nits sister companies in a variety of industries. \u201cWe prepare people by sending\nthem on programmes with Beam Suntory and Suntory Group, by giving them stretch\nassignments and authority to come up with breakthrough projects between the\ndifferent entities.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the development programmes, Beam Suntory conducts local market\nand functional recognition regularly, tied in to locally relevant initiatives.\nTeam and individual recognition is also done on an ad-hoc basis and locally\nowned.\n\n### Canon Singapore\n\nPhotographic and digital imaging solutions company Canon believes both rewards\nand recognition factor equally in driving employee engagement and motivation.\n\n**Suzuki Takamasa, Director of Human Resources at Canon Singapore** , says:\n\n> ##### Recognition drives engagement while solely relying on rewards to\n> motivate employees would be difficult. Hence, organisations need a balance\n> of both.\n\nAt Canon Singapore, the compensation philosophy is centred around reward for\nperformance.\n\nTop performers are recognised through monetary rewards as well as being\nprioritised for greater exposure opportunities through roles in cross-\nfunctional projects and overseas assignments.\n\n\u201cAt Canon, new initiatives to enhance processes and great service attitudes\nare applauded. Internal awards such as \u2018Service Heroes\u2019, the \u2018Canon\nBreakthrough\u2019 or long service awards aim to instil pride and recognition for\nthe deserving staff.\u201d\n\nWinners are spotlighted on the Canon intranet and are featured in the monthly\ninternal e-newsletter. For the \u201cCanon Breakthrough Awards\u201d, selected winners\nalso have the opportunity to share their success stories with management and\nall staff.\n\nOn the reason behind the approach, Takamasa says: \u201cExtrinsic rewards must be\nbalanced with intrinsic ones. To further develop our talent and top\nperformers, we offer them greater exposure that will provide more growth and\nlearning avenues within Canon.\u201d\n\nTo communicate the rewards, the firm makes use of various face-to-face\nconversations with employees such as town hall sessions and group dialogues.\n\nAdditionally, Canon Singapore\u2019s CEO believes in hearing things from the\nground. Hence, dialogue sessions with the CEO are carried out on a monthly\nbasis, providing a platform for staff to share their suggestions and views\nwith the CEO directly.\n\nApart from this, regular updates are also shared through various employee\ncommunication touch-points such as monthly e-newsletters and \u201cCanon Express\u201d \u2013\na weekly live broadcast by employees.\n\nWhen it comes to creating an environment for recognition, Canon Singapore\nmakes it easy by providing employees with an easily accessible platform on its\nintranet system. Known as \u201cGive a Wow\u201d, the system was launched by HR to\nencourage workplace appreciation. Takamasa explains: \u201cStaff can utilise this\nto thank those who have helped and motivated them.\u201d\n\n### Case study: Heraeus Asia Pacific Holding\n\nRecognised by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment\nPractices (TAFEP) as an exemplary employer in the area of rewards and\nrecognition is Heraeus Asia Pacific Holding. The German technology company\u2019s\nphilosophy is pay for performance.\n\nDuring the annual merit increment exercise in July, managers are provided with\na guide on rewarding employees fairly. This helps Heraeus retain the best\nstaff, while reinforcing the company\u2019s values, goals and objectives.\nMeanwhile, the \u201crecognition award\u201d recognises and rewards employees for their\nextraordinary performance or contribution.\n\n**Raymund Chua Teck Boon, Managing Director for Heraeus Asia Pacific Holding**\n, says:\n\n> ##### We reward employees and teams for extraordinary performance or\n> contribution to the company.\n\nThe award is categorised into three levels \u2013 gold for stellar performance,\nsilver for outstanding performance and bronze for good performance \u2013 with a\nmonetary reward corresponding to the level, starting from $50 going up to <\n$1,500 to a maximum of 10% of an employee\u2019s annual base salary.\n\nEmployees are also rewarded according to the overall company and business unit\nperformance, individual targets and a third component, that is, the leadership\nfactor.\n\n**Roslyn Ten, General Manager of TAFEP** , notes:\n\n> ##### Exemplary employers are those that go beyond monetary means to reward\n> and recognise employees.\n\n\"They see compensation, benefits, recognition, skills development, and career\nopportunities as part of the total rewards that an employee receives as a form\nof recognition for their good performance.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to evaluating an employee\u2019s performance, it is important for\norganisations to adopt appraisal systems that are fair and objective, with\nmeasurable standards for evaluation. This will help ensure that employees are\nassessed and promoted on the basis of merit regardless of age, race, gender,\nreligion, marital status and family responsibilities or disability. As a\nresult, employees will feel more motivated and engaged at work, which in turn,\ncontributes to the success of the organisation.\u201d\n\n### Case study: HP Inc\n\nHP Inc believes rewards and recognition must work together. **Sowjanya Reddy,\nRegional Head of HR for Asia Pacific and Japan at HP** , says: \u201cAs part of our\nculture \u2013 the HP Way \u2013 we are committed to maintaining a holistic and\ntransparent compensation structure that ensures equal pay regardless of gender\nor ethnicity. We design and deliver rewards and recognition programmes that\nare flexible, tailored, performance-based and market-competitive.\u201d\n\nAll employees are eligible for an annual cash bonus based on overall company\nperformance and the employee\u2019s individual performance. Managers are coached to\ncreate a recognition moment that reinforces HP\u2019s rewards philosophy by talking\nwith employees about how their personal efforts and company performance led to\ntheir bonus payment.\n\nTop performing staff are also rewarded with career advancement. Sharing an\nexample, she says: \u201cOur technical employees can advance to roles that give\nthem an opportunity to influence our strategic direction and that carry\nappreciation in their titles such as \u2018distinguished technologist\u2019.\u201d\n\n> ##### Another way HP shows appreciation is through nomination-based\n> programmes that allow key contributors to be publicly recognised and\n> rewarded.\n\n\u201cOur annual HP Reinventor Rewards invites employees to submit a team project\nor product in one of eight categories. The winners receive recognition such as\npublic acknowledgment at a company-wide meeting or news coverage in internal\npublications.\u201d\n\nHP encourages managers and employees to make recognition a habit, and to\npractise it both within and across teams.\n\n\u201cWe coach managers to demonstrate regular appreciation for their team members,\nand we encourage employees to recognise their peers by sending e-cards with a\nmessage that describes what they appreciate about their peer\u2019s work. We are\nexpanding this programme in the coming year to also include opportunities for\nemployees to recognise more personal milestones.\u201d\n\nHP provides each manager with a rewards budget of points they can allocate to\nemployees for selecting merchandise or experiences from an online catalogue.\nThe firm is also in the beta stages of a recognition \u201cconcierge\u201d initiative\nwhere a manager can work with the recognition team to create a unique\nmemorable moment specifically designed for its employee.\n\n### How to communicate rewards effectively\n\nRewards may be straightforward to implement, yet difficult to communicate.\nLeah Donovan says: \u201cUnless you are going to be incredibly transparent with\nemployees on the different salary and job levels within the organisation, and\nthe bands that are applied to each role, you have got to be very considered in\nwhat you communicate and how you communicate, because you can\u2019t just tell\nsomeone half the story.\n\n\u201cIf the organisation is not mature, you have to think about the depth you will\ngo into educating them, and if they are ready to understand what the job\nlevels and salary bands are. If they are not ready, you don\u2019t want to confuse\nthem.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the concern of maintaining a competitive advantage, noting that\nbeing transparent may make it easy for competitors to increase their offering\nto poach people.\n\n\u201cHowever, if you have an engaged workforce and are paying your employees what\nthey are worth in the market, then competitors will find it hard to poach,\neven if they are aware of what you pay.\u201d\n\nTapping on his experiences, Eric Wong, of Intel Wise, advises: When handling a\ncommunication of such nature, something that could go both ways, it is\nimportant to know what message we\u2019re bringing across. Prepare and anticipate\nthe questions and angles. Deliver the communication in a firm and concise\nmanner.\u201d\n\nA common problem, he notes, is when managers try to soften the message. \u201cThis\nis very risky as the message may be distorted. So, don\u2019t try to undermine what\nyou\u2019ve prepared by changing the message or the way that it was intended to be\ndelivered.\u201d\n\n### An environment that makes recognition easy\n\nWhen it comes to recognition, becoming great at it involves training and\nstarting from the top. According to **Ken Lim, Human Resources Manager at The\nEsplanade Co** , who shares his personal experience, most employees feel\nunappreciated because they are not receiving any feedback for the great work\nthey have done.\n\nSuggesting a solution, he says: \u201cCompanies can consider training for managers\non providing effective feedback as part of their leadership development.\nManagers can also be encouraged to provide timely feedback and not wait until\nthe annual performance review.\u201d If the achievement is significant enough, he\nalso suggests to recognise it openly among peers, but cautions to ensure\nconsistency in such cases.\n\n###### Note: Unless otherwise stated, views expressed in this feature are\nbased on personal experience.\n\n* * *\n\n**Read the March edition of Human Resources, Singapore:**\n\n[![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/03/05140624/hrsg_mar19.jpg)](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/)\n\n\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

At\nthat time, the 23-year-old was over the moon at securing a full-time job\nbefore most of her peers did.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEverything went fine\u201d for about a month after her internship began, she said.\nThen, things went pear-shaped quickly.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak, which originated in China and had rattled Singapore\nsince January, has morphed into a full-blown pandemic.\n\nThe coronavirus can lead to severe respiratory problems and even death. As it\nspreads its tentacles all over the world, leading to hundreds of thousands of\ncases, travel restrictions turned into border closures.\n\nIn just a few months, the interdependent global economy has taken a\npummelling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Singapore expected to go into a full-year recession, companies began to\nannounce pay cuts and hiring freezes. Some, like Ms Chua\u2019s company, even began\nto lay off workers.\n\nOn Mar 26, the firm told Ms Chua that it would be laying off \u201chalf the team\u201d,\nincluding herself and several full-timers. She was told to pack her things and\nleave on the day itself.\n\n\u201cIt feels bad ... suddenly my whole plan was derailed,\u201d she said.\n\nIf Ms Chua is among those who have the misfortune of graduating amid a looming\nrecession, the millennials who are working in industries which have been\nbattered by Covid-19 are faring no better.\n\n### [READ: Singapore residents returning from ASEAN countries, France, India\nand Switzerland must self-isolate at hotels](/news/singapore/covid19-shn-\nasean-france-india-switzerland-imported-community-12610172)\n\n### [READ: Mustafa Centre to close for at least two weeks; will undergo\ndisinfection](/news/singapore/mustafa-centre-closed-two-weeks-\ncovid-19-12609734)  \n\nA Singapore Airlines (SIA) air stewardess, who wanted to be known only as\nIngrid, was last rostered on a flight in mid-March. Since SIA announced on Mar\n23 that it would be cutting 96 per cent of capacity due to vanishing demand,\nshe has been grounded, earning little more than S$1,000 a month in basic pay,\nabout one-fifth of her usual salary.\n\nIngrid then reached out to her aunt, who works at a hawker stall selling\nMuslim food, but was told that there were no vacancies.\n\n\u201cBefore this I went out on all my days off and would sit with my friends over\nbrunch at overpriced cafes, but I can\u2019t afford to do that now,\u201d said the\n25-year-old, who is currently cooped up at home scrolling through job-hiring\nsites.\n\n### [READ: COVID-19: Singapore Airlines to provide 300 'care ambassadors' to\nfill manpower gap at hospitals](/news/singapore/covid-19-singapore-airlines-\ncare-ambassadors-hospital-manpower-12608118)  \n\n### [READ: Commentary: Bitter truths for Singapore Airlines about this\naviation industry crash](/news/singapore/singapore-airlines-\ncovid-19-coronavirus-crash-aviation-industry-12591826)  \n\nThen there is Mr Dave Lim, a freelance photographer and videographer, who\nfrequently does events photography. Since Covid-19 has virtually wiped out\nlarge-scale corporate events across the island, he has seen his earnings fall\nby 50 per cent.\n\nThe 26-year-old said that he is attempting to switch to filming\nadvertisements, which remains in demand. However, he is finding this a\nchallenge, as he is not as well-established in the advertising scene and has\ndifficulty finding clients.  \n\nLike Ms Chua, Ingrid and Mr Lim, the majority of those in their early 20s to\nmid-30s \u2014 commonly referred to as millennials \u2014 are facing a crisis of global\nproportions for the first time in their adult lives. And as far as crises go,\nthey do not come much bigger than what the world is currently experiencing.\n\nWith millennials often dismissed as the \u201cstrawberry generation\u201d \u2014 easily\n\u201cbruised\u201d when faced with societal pressures or made to do some heavy lifting\n\u2014 will they be able to handle a crisis that has been dubbed as a \u201conce-in-a-\ngeneration occurrence\u201d, and one that could turn out to be the worst global\nupheaval since the Great Depression in the 1930s?\n\nAmong the more than a dozen millennials, ranging from soon-to-be university\ngraduates to workers in their mid-30s with families to feed, those who have\nlost jobs or business revenues in the past few weeks said the old adage of\n\u201csaving for a rainy day\u201d has acquired a new importance for them.\n\nWhile some used to lead lavish lifestyles which included frequent shopping and\ndining at higher-end establishments, they have since stopped all unnecessary\nspending and started to save money for the tough times ahead.\n\nThey have largely stayed at home (also partly due to social-distancing\nmeasures), go out less with friends, and will not be making any overseas trips\nanytime soon, especially with travel options almost non-existent. Instead,\nthey have been cooped up indoors searching for jobs, or attending courses to\nlearn new skills.\n\n![big read\n2](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\nAmong the more than a dozen millennials whom TODAY spoke to, ranging from\nsoon-to-be university graduates to workers in their mid-30s with families to\nfeed, those who have lost jobs or business revenues in the past few weeks said\nthe old adage of \u201csaving for a rainy day\u201d has acquired a new importance for\nthem.

In fact, some said that their parents would help them to stay\nafloat if there was no other choice. However, most are reluctant to depend on\nparental support, with one final-year student saying she \u201ccannot fathom the\nthought\u201d of living off someone else once she graduates.\n\nHowever, for some older millennials - those who have children and elderly\nparents to support - there is less of a safety net.\n\nThey said that compared to a decade ago when they faced the 2008/2009 global\nfinancial meltdown - triggered by the United States sub-prime mortgage crisis\n- in their early 20s, they now have greater responsibilities and a lot more to\nlose if they are not able to save up and earn a living.\n\n### [READ: Moody's cuts outlook for Singapore banks on COVID-19\nfallout](/news/singapore/coronavirus-covid-19-banks-uob-ocbc-dbs-\nmoodys-12602064)  \n\n### [READ: Commentary: No ordinary disruption \u2013 a rising generation meets the\ncoronavirus](/news/singapore/covid-19-coronavirus-graduates-students-job-\ncareers-12571044)\n\n **HOW ECONOMIC SITUATION DETERIORATED**\n\nIn February, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) slashed Singapore\u2019s\neconomic growth forecast for 2020 from between 0.5 and 2.5 per cent to between\n-0.5 and 1.5 per cent.\n\nAt that time, the COVID-19 outbreak was still concentrated in China, with most\nof the cases occurring there. However, the uncertainty at that time was\nalready enough for MTI to warn of a full-year recession.\n\nOn Mar 26, the ministry further downgraded Singapore\u2019s economic growth\nforecast for the year to between -4 and -1 per cent. By then, the global\nsituation was vastly different than the one in February, with the virus having\ninfected hundreds of thousands across the globe, and at least US$12 trillion\nwiped off world stock markets.\n\nThat same day also saw Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee\nKeat unveiling a [S$48 billion Resilience\nBudget](/news/singapore/covid19-coronavirus-budget-5-things-heng-swee-\nkeat-12579156) to help workers, businesses and households. This comes on top\nof the S$6.4 billion support package unveiled during the Budget in February.\n\nIn the financial markets, Wall Street\u2019s Dow Jones and S&P 500 had seen 22 per\ncent and 20 per cent slumps respectively in the first three months of this\nyear. During the Great Depression, in comparison, the record quarterly drop\nfor Wall Street was 40 per cent.\n\nIn Singapore, though there have been no reports of widespread layoffs thus\nfar, a few well-known companies, such as SIA, property developer CapitaLand\nand transport operator SMRT, have begun to slash wages or freeze the pay of\nits senior staff.\n\n### [READ: COVID-19 Resilience Budget: \u2018Landmark\u2019 S$48 billion package to tide\nSingapore through \u2018unprecedented\u2019 crisis](/news/singapore/covid-19-resilience-\nbudget-package-economy-jobs-employment-12578910)  \n\n### [READ: National Wages Council suggests management lead by example when\ncutting pay](/news/singapore/wage-council-covid-19-salaries-basic-12589242)  \n\nWith many companies following suit to implement such cost-cutting measures -\nmost of the millenials interviewed said their employers had already taken\nsimilar steps - the National Wages Council (NWC) on Mar 30 issued guidelines\non how they should cut wages responsibly.\n\nAmong other guidelines, NWC recommended management teams of struggling\ncompanies to \u201clead by example\u201d when considering wage cuts, and to keep the\nsalaries of low-wage workers intact.\n\nWhile many industries are already suffering from the effects of the general\ndownturn in the economy, the aviation sector is among the hardest hit as many\ncountries have imposed travel bans.

It\u2019s time we pause to ask ourselves why. Even though\norganisations globally aim to understand what drives their employees\u2019\nperformance through multiple performance management tools, it has\nunfortunately help them to only map out \u2018what\u2019 leaders and team members aim to\nachieve, and does not lay emphasis on the \u2018how\u2019 and the intangible factors\nthat influence motivation and well-being of employees within the organization.\n\nExtrinsic and intrinsic motivations are the cornerstones for high performance,\nand this comes from creating a strong sense of purpose and alignment,\nestablishing an effective rewards and recognition practice. The key to this is\nby understanding that high performance is not born out of systems that offer\nrecognition as a reward, instead, it comes from internal systems of an\norganisation. Ultimately, when you expect great performance on a daily basis,\nyou must also recognize your employee\u2019s efforts with equal frequency.\nTherefore, implementing a realistic and effective recognition program across\nall levels of employees will bring you significantly positive results.\n\n### Devising a human centric Recognition framework\n\nRecognition is one of the fundamental elements that impact a person\u2019s sense of\nself-worth, manner of interaction with the workplace, and performance. With\norganisations measuring engagement by noting the intensity of performance and\nintensity of commitment, and by reinforcing such behaviours through a\nrecognition program, organisations can see a steady increase in both.\n\nThe intensity of performance comes from a range of external factors that\nleaders can tap into for amazing results. Making your employees fearless by\nallowing them to voice their opinions and ideas, magnifying their success when\nthey do something that works, and offering a supportive work environment that\nallows people to feel as though they are a part of a team, rather than just\ncogs in the machine, can help leaders transform their employees into driven\nand passionate individuals.\n\nSo, how do you devise an engagement strategy for intrinsic motivation?\n\nBrad Shuck, our Academic Partner, states that, employees at a particular\nworkplace has nothing to do with the organization itself. Instead, it has\neverything to do with the way managers treat employees. Additionally,\nemployees must also connect with the larger purpose of their work, and\nunderstand why they are doing, what they are doing. When employees feel that\nthe work environment is a safe place to offer ideas and try innovative\napproaches to solving problems, they are more likely to be engaged and\norganically offer better results. Establishing this connection with individual\nemployees begins right from recruitment, eventually resulting in lower\nattrition rate.\n\n### Making Every Moment Count\n\nIn order to build a more human centric work environment that focuses on\noffering stability, support, and on fostering high performance, our global\nresearchers devised a strategy that aims to not only attract the talent you\nneed, but also retain them for longer periods. This strategy relies on\noffering recognition on a few crucial days that mark an employee\u2019s journey\nwith the organization \u2013 the Decision Day, First Day, Every Day, Achievement\nDay, and Referral Day.\n\nA candidate\u2019s Decision Day helps determine whether they can see themselves at\nthe organization. For this, one must engage in a few activities that revolve\naround building the right perception to attract great talent. This means,\nevery organisation needs a strong Employee Value Proposition (EVP) that\nincludes talent acquisition campaigns, and new talent welcome experience (that\noccurs before the first day of joining). Similarly, The First Day marks a\ncrucial one in the employee\u2019s journey \u2013 this day sets the tone for their\nemployment with you.\n\nNext, managers must strive to offer recognition on a daily basis. Whether this\nrecognition is offered for soft-behavior based achievements like arriving at\nthe workplace on time or offering support to other team members, or is offered\nfor professional traits like adherence to deadlines or great work, is a factor\nthat depends largely on the traits that your organization values.\n\nThis is because, at the end of the day, each organization must build its\nculture based on the qualities it values. Promoting behaviors that match your\nculture goes a long way in establishing the same. This defines the Every Day\nof your EVP philosophy.\n\nThe purpose of the Achievement Day is often confused with recognition itself.\nThis day is meant for formal rewards in the forms of raises, bonuses, and\nawards, and is not a substitute for the daily recognition that can help\nemployees feel more motivated. However, having said that, the Achievement Day\ndoes function as a form of public recognition in front of one\u2019s peers, and\nleaders should not discount the same from the EVP strategy.\n\nFinally, you\u2019ll see the cumulative effects of continual recognition and high\nperformance on the Referral Day.\n\n### Offering rewards that resonate with different generations of employees\n\nWith the millennial workforce increasingly valuing experiences over monetary\nbenefits, it is crucial for organizations to understand that a simple cash\nbonus is not enough to reward and boost employee morale and performance.\nOffering non-cash rewards, such as the opportunity to travel, a special dinner\nexperience, or even a movie ticket resonates far more with younger employees.\n\nOur studies have shown that due to the fact that over 69% Millennials\nexperience, to use a colloquial term, FOMO (the Fear of Missing Out), 3 out of\n4 Millennials state that they would rather be rewarded with experiences over\ncash benefits. Additionally, international organisations are now looking to\ntap into FOMO culture to boost their employees\u2019 motivation and performance\nlevels. A study conducted by PWC showed that 65% of corporates are now\nresearching non-cash rewards to offer recognition.\n\n### What to expect after establishing an effective recognitions program?\n\nRecognition leads to employees that are more motivated to work hard, and work\nsmart. When employees sense that they are part of a larger picture, they are\nfar more likely to offer creative solutions, and act on improving their\noverall performance in the workplace. As this improvement is largely born from\nintrinsic motivation, an employees\u2019 heightened performance develops at a pace\nthat is organic to that individual\u2019s pace of work, which ultimately results in\nperformance that does not come at the cost of decreasing one\u2019s work-life\nbalance or sense of personal time. As a result, the scope for dissatisfaction\nlevels with the job also decreases phenomenally, which in turn lowers the\norganisation\u2019s attrition rate.\n\nAdditionally, with studies showing that intrinsically happier employees being\n33% more prone to helping out other team members, organizations can stand to\nbenefit from a culture of teamwork and motivation, rather than only mindless\ncompetition. Engaged employees that notice their personal and professional\ngoals aligning are less likely to leave organizations.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Benefits &

Championing the\nimportance of company culture, of creating and fostering an employee brand\nwhere people feel a sense of purpose and that their contribution is valid, all\nfall under HR\u2019s remit \u2013 at least a large part of defining what is needed,\ncertainly does.\n\nOften companies are focused on ways to increase productivity, which tends to\ntranslate in many people\u2019s minds as cost reduction, the loss of resources,\npeople and budget.\n\nBut it is the companies and HR teams that are able to look at the problem in a\ndifferent way that are more likely to see increased performance, higher levels\nof commitment and an employee brand that stands head and shoulders above\nothers.\n\nInstead of asking how to improve and/or maximise productivity, you should be\nasking what needs to be done to ensure that your people have the opportunity\nto thrive in their roles.\n\nDecades of engagement survey results show that people who are more engaged to\nperform at higher levels are more likely to stay with a company.\n\nThere are some great examples of what happens when you think in this way. Take\nFord for example \u2013 it was one of the first companies to recognise that for\nemployees to thrive, it needed to reduce working hours.\n\nCutting its employee\u2019s hours to eight hours per day rather than the\ntraditional 10- to 16-hour working days, resulted in an increase in\nproductivity.\n\nThe move to a four-day working week has been shown to have a similar impact.\n\n> Create a continuous learning culture, starting at the top\n\nPaying attention to what employees\u2019 value and what they look for is a sure-\nfire way to ensure your \u2018people investments\u2019 are in areas that matter and make\na difference.\n\nHelping employees thrive can also counteract the loss of pay growth. A\n[report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/bulletins/labourproductivity/apriltojune2019)\npublished earlier this year by the Office for National Statistics found that\nfailure to maintain productivity growth was one of the main reasons for a lost\ndecade of pay growth, costing British workers as much as \u00a35,000 in missing\nincome.\n\nIt\u2019s important, therefore, to understand that every member of staff \u2013 from the\nmost junior to the most senior members of staff \u2013 plays a crucial role in\nperformance of a business, and HR must work with senior leadership to ensure\nemployees have the support they need to succeed and achieve their objectives.\n\nHere are some effective strategies for HR practitioners to increase employee\nproductivity:\n\n  1. **Encourage a learning culture within your organisation**\n\nCreate a continuous learning culture, starting at the top. From team meeting\u2019s\nto feedback sessions, to formal development, leaders can embed a number of\ntechniques and approaches that enhance and build capabilities on an on-going\nbasis.\n\nHR, often a member of the senior leadership team, is in prime position to\nmodel, encourage and establish the learning rhythms that can then be applied\nsimilarly across the organisation.\n\nIt also means that leadership needs to do more than just say learning and\ndevelopment matter. They must demonstrate support through their actions and\nreinforce training and development, recognising new skills and encouraging\npeople to share their learnings with other.\n\n  1. **Motivate staff to be accountable for their own development**\n\nWhile HR and senior leaders should be at the heart of learning and\ndevelopment, individuals must also be accountable for their own progression.\n\nIndividuals who lean on managers for direction, rather than seek out\nopportunities independently, can unfortunately be a real drain on both time\nand resources.\n\nDevelopment requires ownership by both employees and the company. As such\nemployees should be encouraged to look for opportunities to learn and\nprogress, whether that\u2019s through peer-to-peer learning, webinars or external\ncourses.\n\n  1. **Make sure employees are comfortable**\n\nIt\u2019s not just the learning and development that staff are able to access that\nleads to high performing organisations. The environment can also be a large\nfactor.\n\nWhile office layouts have changed over the years, the importance of employee\ncomfort has not. From the room temperature to the type of chairs we sit on,\nthe smallest things can have a costly impact, but there are simple steps HR\nteams can take to help ensure that the environment is inducive to people\ncontributing their best.\n\n\n\n> It\u2019s important to address desk discomfort; back pain, headaches and a lack\n> of concentration can often be attributed to poor ergonomics\n\nHR should look at ways to implement practical work schedules to allow staff to\nenjoy a good work-life balanceAdjusting lighting to brighten up a dimly lit\noffice will reduce eye strain, as well as drowsiness and headaches.\n\nSimilarly, setting a consistent temperature in your office can work wonders;\nit\u2019s important to provide methods of both sufficient heating and cooling\nthroughout the year.\n\nNoise levels can also be a factor \u2013 if you work in an open-plan office, ensure\nthat there are quiet spaces for staff to be able to concentrate.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to address desk discomfort; back pain, headaches and a\nlack of concentration can often be attributed to poor ergonomics.\n\nInvesting in good chairs, offering standing desks and removing unnecessary\nclutter can all make a significant difference to office productivity levels.\n\n  1. **Offer flexible working options**\n\nThe four-day week is starting to gain attention, and yet flexible working\nschedules have been around a lot time. The problem is that many companies fail\nto consider just how valuable flexible working hours can be.\n\nFrom boosting employee morale and engagement to enhancing productivity,\ncompanies that are abandoning traditional, ridged working hours in favour of\nflexitime are seeing results, and for good reason.\n\nHR should look at ways to implement practical work schedules to allow staff to\nenjoy a good work-life balance.\n\n  1. **Encourage healthy eating and exercise**\n\nWe\u2019re all found guilty of snacking at work from time to time \u2013 whether it\u2019s a\nbirthday to celebrate or food left over from a meeting, the 3pm slump has\nbecome synonymous with a sweet treat.\n\nHowever, there is a correlation between what we eat and our energy levels. If\nyou find that your employees are reaching for a sugary snack as a regular\nafternoon energy booster \u2013 followed by the dragging of feet once the sugar\nrush has worn off \u2013 you may want to consider encouraging a healthier office\nculture.\n\nMany companies have begun to offer discounted gym memberships as part of their\nbenefits packages, while others organise lunchtime exercise classes to get\ntheir workforce up and moving.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[Give me three issues of TJ for just\n\u00a39.99](https://www.dodsshop.co.uk/store/products,training-\njournal_22.htm?promo=TJTRIAL)\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nIn addition, why not swap the sugar and make fresh fruit and other healthy\nsnack options more readily available, so staff aren\u2019t tempted to buy and graze\non chocolate, biscuits and crisps?\n\n  1. **Reward staff for their hard work**\n\nPut simply, employees respond to appreciation at work, especially when they\nare recognised for their hard work and dedication.\n\nWell-engaged staff who are made to feel truly valued by an organisation are\nmore likely to thrive (aka be more productive), be proactive and deliver\nbeyond what\u2019s needed.\n\nPositive reinforcement sets an example for everyone in the company, motivating\nevery member of the team to do their best work.\n\nEmployee recognition doesn\u2019t have to come in the form of an elaborate event \u2013\na simple thank you, a hand-written note, financial incentives, certificates of\nachievement, extra holiday, celebratory meals and gifts and experiences are\nall great ways to show appreciation for a job well done.\n\nSo, when you are next considering how can you maximise productivity, pause for\na moment and reframe the question to: \u201cwhat can we do to ensure our people\nthrive?\u201d\n\n\n\n**About the author**\n\nRita Trehan is CEO of [Dare Worldwide](https://www.dareworldwide.com/) and\nauthor of [Unleashing Capacity: The hidden human\nresources](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Unleashing-Capacity-Hidden-Human-\nResources/dp/1912555506/ref=sr_1_1?qid=1569421183&refinements=p_27%3ARita+Trehan&s=books&sr=1-1&text=Rita+Trehan)\n\nTags\n\n[Diversity and inclusion](/tags/diversity-and-inclusion)\n\n[Engagement](/tags/engagement)\n\n[Evaluation and ROI](/tags/evaluation-and-roi)\n\nCategories\n\n[Business and industry](/categories/business-and-industry)\n\n[Education and skills](/categories/education-and-skills)\n\n### Share this page\n\n[![Printer-friendly\nversion](https://www.trainingjournal.com/sites/all/modules/print/icons/print_icon.png)Printer-\nfriendly version](https://www.trainingjournal.com/print/6879 \"Display a\nprinter-friendly version of this page.\")\n\n### CONTRIBUTIONS FROM READERS\n\nPlease [login](/user/login) to post a comment or [register for a free\naccount](/user/register).\n\n### Related Articles\n\n[![three young women comparing work on\nlaptops](https://www.trainingjournal.com/sites/www.trainingjournal.com/files/styles/original_-\n_local_copy/entityshare/34353%3Fitok%3DI_bhqpOe)](/articles/features/international-\nwomen%E2%80%99s-day-paving-way-future-success)\n\n[International Women\u2019s Day: Paving the way for future\nsuccess](/articles/features/international-women%E2%80%99s-day-paving-way-\nfuture-success)\n\n9 March 2020\n\nTo mark this year\u2019s event Olivia Manning asked 10 STEM industry experts to\nshare their thoughts and advice.\n\n[![&#039;busy introverting&#039;

Give Your Workers the Opportunity to Upskill and Ready Themselves for\nNew Roles\n\nDo you appreciate your employees enough to set them free? A robust learning\nand development (L&D;) program should ideally be geared to train your employee\nin myriad skill sets and knowledge areas so that they are equipped to take up\nnew roles in either their existing organization or even elsewhere.\n\nEmployees today value training as a primary motivator for working for a\ncompany, as this helps in their individual professional journey. Cutting-edge\ntools like MOOCs, e-Learning software, Adaptive Learning courses, and Blended\nLearning environments show your employees that you are truly invested in their\nprogression pathways.\n\n## 2\\. Make Employee Appreciation Day (or any Day of the Year) a WFH Day\n\nAdvanced technologies are breaking down locational and timeline barriers,\nallowing employees to log in at a time and place of their convenience. With\neasy-to-access, device-agnostic productivity apps like G-Suite or Dropbox, as\nwell as engaging collaboration tools such as Slack, Working from Home, while\nmaintaining a constant line-of-communication with the team is extremely easy.\n\nYou could leverage solutions like these to set apart a specific day of the\nweek or month as mandatory WFH, giving your employees a chance to catch up\nwith their friends and family. For small to mid-sized businesses, the level of\nflexibility can be a big differentiator when competing with world-renowned\nemployers. That\u2019s why SMBs were found heading the pack in the\n[Perkbox](https://www.perkbox.com/uk) research, with 60% of companies who\n\u201crecognize freely\u201d in the mid-sized bracket.\n\n## 3\\. Utilize Data from Project Management for Continuous Appreciation\n\nOften, amidst large teams and complex work stacks, small achievements and\nminor but necessary contributions (made exactly at the right time) get\noverlooked. However, the employee responsible is an integral part of the\nworkforce and it is essential that they are made aware of their role. A full-\nscale project management solution like Trello will display clear trends and\nindividual highlights that can be used to reward your employees.\n\nPerkbox found that Monday and Wednesday were the favorites for showing\nemployee appreciation -- project management data tells you who to reward\nduring these sessions. The data can even be fed into powerful performance\nmeasurement models to reaffirm the findings during annual appraisals or any\nstandardized appreciation event.\n\n_**Also read: _[9 Reasons Why You Need Rewards and Recognition\nTechnology](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-\nrecognition/9-reasons--you-need-rewards-and-recognition-tech/)_**_\n\n## 4\\. Meet and Exceed Employee Expectations around Everyday Amenities\n\nThere\u2019s no way around it; office essentials should be seamless, ready-to-use,\nand near-invisible in terms of availability. This means employees should be\nable to reach IT, staff, solve admin issues, answer HR queries, and self-serve\ncommon requests without even thinking about it.\n\nFoundational technologies such as a self-service portal and a company-wide\nintranet streamline day-on-day tasks for your workers, making their actual\njobs far simpler while also letting them know that the organization\nappreciates their contributions, and is investing in their daily \u2018ease-of-\nwork\u2019.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile Employee Appreciation Day comes around only once-a-year, there\u2019s no one-\nright-time to reward & recognize your workers. We\u2019ve shared four creative ways\nto deploy technology to reinforce the values behind Employee Appreciation Day,\nbesides regular perks & benefits.\n\n\u201cWhatever the reason, we must break with the common misconception that\nmotivation in the workplace is only driven by a pay cheque, taking all the\nsteps possible to showcase \u2018employee appreciation\u2019 throughout the entire year,\nparticularly as we look to encourage other, less traditional skill sets in our\nstaff, such as the much needed soft skills,\u201d said Chieu Cao, Co-founder of\n_[Perkbox](http://perkbox.com/)_.\n\n_**Also read: _[From the Archives: 4 Creative Ways to Reward Employees in the\nNew Year](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-\nrecognition/4-creative-ways-to-reward-employees-in-the-new-year/)_**_\n\nOf course, Employee Appreciation Day is a great time to look at personalized\nbenefits packages for star performers or exceptional teams. However, we\nrecommend keeping your ear to the ground and adopting R&R; technologies (among\nother tools) to make employee appreciation an organizational habit.\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Femployee-appreciation-day-exclusive-4-ways-technology-can-\namplify-your-rewards-and-recognition-\nprograms%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Employee+Appreciation+Day+Exclusive%3A+4+Ways+Technology+Can+Amplify+Your+Rewards+and+Recognition+Programs\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Employee+Appreciation+Day+Exclusive%3A+4+Ways+Technology+Can+Amplify+Your+Rewards+and+Recognition+Programs&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Femployee-appreciation-day-exclusive-4-ways-technology-can-\namplify-your-rewards-and-recognition-\nprograms%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Femployee-appreciation-day-exclusive-4-ways-technology-can-\namplify-your-rewards-and-recognition-\nprograms%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-\nand-recognition%2Femployee-appreciation-day-exclusive-4-ways-technology-can-\namplify-your-rewards-and-recognition-\nprograms%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Employee Appreciation Day Exclusive: 4 Ways\nTechnology Can Amplify Your Rewards and Recognition\nPrograms&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frewards-and-\nrecognition%2Femployee-appreciation-day-exclusive-4-ways-technology-can-\namplify-your-rewards-and-recognition-\nprograms%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Rewards & Recognition ](/category/rewards-and-\nrecognition/ \"Rewards & Recognition\")\n\n  * [ ![How to Retain Top Talent with Employee Recognition: Q&A With Cord Himelstein of Halo Recognition](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/halo_recognition_hr_talk_interview_545_x_240_px_5dc1685b95dbf.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/rewards-and-recognition/cord-himelstein-halo-recognition-top-talent/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How to Retain Top Talent with Employee Recognition: Q&A; With Cord\nHimelstein of Halo Recognition\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/rewards-and-recognition/cord-\nhimelstein-halo-recognition-top-talent/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nCord Himelstein, VP of marketing and communication, Halo Recognition, speaks\nabout how HR needs to approach employee recognition programs and more.\n\nby [Neha Pradhan](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/neha-\npradhan/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Nov 05, 2019\n\n  * [ ![6 Statistics That Confirm Employee Recognition and Retention Are Related](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/statistics_for_employee_recognition_and_retention_5e4e903c0e87c.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-recognition/employee-recognition-and-retention-statistics/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 6 Statistics That Confirm Employee Recognition and Retention Are\nRelated ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-\nrecognition/employee-recognition-and-retention-\nstatistics/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nFor companies looking to strengthen their retention capabilities, an effective\nrecognition program is essential.

culture](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/08/GettyImages-organizationalculture700-700x450.jpg)\n\nWhen Lisa Bettinger Buckingham took the HR reigns at Lincoln Financial Group\nin December 2008, the financial-services industry was struggling to survive a\nglobal economic crisis that many economists today believe brought the world to\nthe brink of a second Great Depression. Just weeks into Buckingham\u2019s tenure,\nthe Radnor, Pa.-based insurance and investment-management company laid off 12%\nof workers in its Lincoln Financial Distributors division. A few months later,\nLincoln announced it would accept $950 million in capital as part of the\ngovernment\u2019s $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), made a public\noffering of $600 million of common stock and sold Lincoln National plc, its\nUnited Kingdom unit that sold life insurance and retirement-income products.\n\nAlready a 20-year HR veteran, Buckingham\u2014who currently serves as executive\nvice president and chief people, place and brand officer and, [in 2017, was\nnamed _HRE_ 's HR Executive of the Year](https://hrexecutive.com/investing-in-\nthe-future/)\u2014wasn\u2019t surprised to find morale was low among Lincoln\u2019s\nthen-8,500 employees (Lincoln\u2019s workforce is now 12,000). While she and the\nrest of the management team were confident the company would weather the\nstorm, Buckingham knew the workforce would have to be engaged and motivated to\nrebuild once the dust had settled. Yet, she was concerned about Lincoln\u2019s\nprevailing culture, which she describes as, \u201cThat\u2019s how we do it. This is what\nwe do. We\u2019ve done it this way forever.\u201d For the high-energy Buckingham, who\nleft her position as senior vice president, global talent at Thomson Reuters\nto come to Lincoln, that simply wasn\u2019t going to cut it.\n\nA firm believer in building a strong team, Buckingham brought Chief Diversity\nOfficer Allison Green onboard in 2009 to help implement the changes she\nbelieved would not only engage Lincoln\u2019s workforce to help the company emerge\nfrom the financial crisis, but become a destination employer for the best and\nbrightest in the financial-services industry. Accomplishing that goal would\nentail cultivating a best-in-class organizational culture, an absolute must\nfor any organization that wants to succeed, according to Dave Whittington,\npartner at Calliope Learning, a Victoria, British Columbia-based company\nfocused on leadership and learning.\n\n\u201cHigh-functioning organizations have this wonderful symbiotic relationship\nbetween their organizational strategy and their organizational culture, where\nthe strategic objectives of the organization are supported by the culture, and\nthe culture supports the delivery of the strategic objectives,\u201d says\nWhittington. \u201cA lot of organizations claim they value their culture and\nconsider it a key to their future success but, if you are not measuring it,\nhow do you know that for sure?\u201d\n\n**See also:[2020 vision on 2020 corporate\nculture](https://hrexecutive.com/20-20-vision-on-2020-corporate-culture/)**\n\nThe notion of measuring culture is a challenging one, primarily because it has\nlong been regarded as \u201ctoo intangible, subjective and elusive to track,\u201d\naccording to Greg Besner, vice chairman and founder of CultureIQ, a New York-\nbased provider of culture-management software. Yet, as business leaders\u2014and HR\nexecutives, in particular\u2014are increasingly recognizing the role culture plays\nin determining an organization\u2019s success or failure, there has emerged an\nunderstanding of the need to effectively measure it.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n\u201cMeasuring the culture at your company means understanding how your HR\npolicies, programs and benefits impact everything from employee productivity\nand retention to your company\u2019s reputation as a good corporate citizen,\u201d says\nAnnmarie Neal, chief human resources officer at Ultimate Software in Weston,\nFla. \u201cMeasuring the return on cultural investments can feel more intangible\nthan measuring the ROI of implementing a new product or system, but when you\ninvest in putting your people first, the impact on the business is\ninvaluable.\u201d\n\n**Avenues of Measurement**\n\nRecognizing the need for a streamlined framework, a number of consulting firms\nand software vendors have developed processes and platforms for measuring the\ncomponents that typically comprise an organization\u2019s culture. While surveying\nthe workforce\u2014from top to bottom\u2014is the predominant means of gathering such\ninformation, which components are measured varies from tool to tool, says\nWhittington. Deciding which one to use is a matter of \u201cfinding the right fit.\u201d\nA values-driven organization would be better served by using a cultural-values\nassessment, he says, while a more technically oriented company is likely to\nget more bang for the buck by employing a quantitative approach.\n\nAt Lincoln Financial, four measures comprise its \u201cengagement index\u201d\u2014passion,\neffort, advocacy and retention. Originally, Lincoln management scoffed at\nBuckingham\u2019s proposal to include a passion measure, but she fought to keep\nit\u2014and won.\n\n\u201cThere was a view in the organization that it seemed weak or light-hearted, so\nI had to make a very big case to include it,\u201d recalls Buckingham. \u201cHow I broke\nit down was, \u2018How do you feel on a daily basis when you are driving into work\nor taking the train or going to your office in your house? What keeps your\npassion alive?\u2019 \u201d\n\nLincoln employs a number of avenues for gathering culture-related data. These\ninclude a biannual all-employee survey, periodic culture and engagement pulse\nchecks, and culture input sessions, consisting of 60-minute conversations\nabout Lincoln\u2019s culture with employees and leaders at all levels and in all\nareas of the business. This year, the company will pilot \u201cdaily culture pulse\nchecks\u201d with [Vohtr Inc.](https://www.vohtr.com) using kiosks in three of its\n12 city locations. Each day, a new question will be posed to all employees who\nchoose to visit the kiosk. Some questions will be fun in nature and are\nintended to spark a conversation or connection, while other questions will be\nspecific to Lincoln\u2019s progress against strategic, cultural and engagement\ngoals. The resulting data will be aggregated and available in real time.\n\n\u201cIn this digital age, where everything is on your phone, we chose to have\nkiosks because we wanted something employees could feel and touch and go up to\nand be seen giving feedback,\u201d says Green. \u201cThey can see all the responses of\nwhat people are saying, and we can use the data in real time to help us pivot,\nif necessary, around initiatives and practices and as we are thinking about\nrolling out new programs or positioning messages.\u201d\n\nCommunicating both good and bad responses is important, but maintaining\nconfidentiality is key to ensuring high participation and honest feedback,\nsays David Shanklin, managing director of culture solutions for New York-based\nCultureIQ. \u201cMeasuring culture in an anonymous or confidential way is important\nbecause it\u2019s not always safe to speak up, or we may be hesitant to share with\nleaders our views on the frontlines,\u201d he says.\n\nWith that in mind, Buckingham\u2019s team doesn\u2019t provide a team-specific report\nbased on the engagement and pulse surveys to any leader with fewer than eight\npeople in their organization. Instead, those responses are rolled up into the\nnext level. She credits this approach for enabling Lincoln to achieve\nparticipation rates of 88% to 98%.\n\n**More Than a Snapshot**\n\nAt Ultimate Software, three annual surveys help the company assess if it is\nliving up to its \u201cpeople-first\u201d culture. According to Neal, this \u201cregular\ncadence of surveys\u201d provides \u201cstrategic, recurring opportunities to check in\nwith employees around the world.\u201d\n\nIn addition to posing questions related to how employees feel about their\noverall experience\u2014if they\u2019re happy at work, whether the company\u2019s programs\nand benefits are effective, etc.\u2014the surveys focus on daily interactions\nbetween managers and employees, the effectiveness of communication and the\ndevelopment of leaders. The surveys are primarily comprised of open-ended\nquestions, says Neal, because that allows employees to provide \u201chonest,\npersonalized feedback, rather than having to tailor their answers to\npredetermined responses.\u201d\n\nAt Lincoln, continuous measurement helps mitigate one of Buckingham\u2019s\nconcerns: that data collected at a specific cadence could be skewed by recent\nevents or the mood of the employee on a specific day. \u201cWhen you are taking a\npulse survey or a biannual survey or an annual survey, I always wonder whether\nthe results are because of where they are in that moment in time or whether\nthey are really taking that thoughtful step back,\u201d she says.\n\nBuckingham\u2019s concern is a legitimate one, according to Susan Chu, founder of\nPhiladelphia-based Culture Crush. \u201cEngagement or climate is a snapshot, a\nmoment in time, whereas culture is the implicit and passive aspects of the\ncompany, the stuff that\u2019s underneath that you just know and feel and it\u2019s\nunderstood,\u201d she says.\n\n**Related:[See CultureCrush in this tech\nspotlight](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-video-see-culturecrush-in-\nthis-tech-spotlight/)**\n\nRecognizing that culture measurement can\u2019t just be an annual or even biannual\nevent, Buckingham led the initiative to create a Culture and Engagement\nfunction within Diversity and Inclusion to fulfill her vision of evolving\n\u201cengagement being synonymous with a survey event to it being part of the way\n[Lincoln does] business and work[s] together every day.\u201d Launched in 2019, the\nfunction is responsible for \u201cdiagnosing, measuring, and enhancing [Lincoln\u2019s]\norganizational culture and engagement levels.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nIn Seattle, Wash., Tammy Perkins, chief people officer at Pacific Market\nInternational, agrees that surveys are just the beginning when it comes to\nmeasuring culture. \u201cThroughout the year,\u201d she says, \u201cyou need to create\ndifferent types of touchpoints, so you aren\u2019t relying solely on some big\nannual survey that\u2019s more activity than impact. It\u2019s part of the rhythm of the\nbusiness.\u201d\n\nOn a continuous basis, Perkins and her team seek to \u201cactivate channels of\ncommunication and find ways to gauge and assess the pulse of the environment.\u201d\nIn addition to inviting employee participation and feedback, that includes\nlooking at metrics related to performance, rewards, attrition, diversity,\nadvancement opportunities, succession planning, turnover cost per hire,\nreferral rates and more. Externally, Perkins looks to Glassdoor feedback to\nhelp compile a reliable picture of PMI\u2019s culture.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing leadership initiative,\u201d says Perkins. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the fact\nthat you are measuring the culture that\u2019s valuable; it\u2019s the message it sends\nthat management is listening and holding itself accountable, as you take a\nregular employee pulse as the basis for your culture assessment.\u201d\n\nWhatever tools an organization employs to measure their culture, it\u2019s\nimperative that the resulting data are used to enact visible change, says\nShanklin. People are typically more than willing to share their thoughts, he\nsays, but only if they see action being taken as a result of employee\nfeedback.\n\nSince Buckingham\u2019s arrival, Lincoln\u2019s approach has evolved from \u201cmeasure\u201d to\n\u201ccelebrate and fix\u201d and is currently in the process of becoming \u201celevate,\u201d\nwhich entails arming leaders with specific practices they can adopt to make\nimprovements and then holding them accountable. Ultimately, Buckingham says,\nthe goal is to get to a place where Lincoln\u2019s approach to culture and\nengagement is best-in-class, where \u201cvalues, behaviors and practices that\npromote increasing levels of engagement are the cultural norm.\u201d\n\nWhile HR typically leads the effort, Buckingham says, it\u2019s important not to\nview culture as merely the purview of HR. It requires the commitment, support\nand participation of the entire business, not just to undertake a culture\nmeasurement, but to use the resulting data to improve the organization.\n\n\u201cFor those that are trying to learn about culture, they have to really embed\nthemselves with the business and their CEO and leadership team and make sure\nthey are all working towards the same goal,\u201d says Buckingham. \u201cIf you are\nmeasuring your culture and your engagement and you see themes and you are not\naddressing those, you\u2019re going to lose out.\u201d\n\nJulie Cook Ramirez is a Rockford, Ill.-based journalist and copywriter\ncovering all aspects of human resources.

Here's Part 2 of our feature interview.**_\n\n_**Read:[It\u2019s one big McFamily at McDonald\u2019s](https://hrmasia.com/its-one-big-\nmcfamily-at-mcdonalds/)**_\n\n_**Read:[Transforming jobs at McDonald\u2019s amidst\nautomation](https://hrmasia.com/mcdonalds-humanising-jobs-amidst-\nautomation/)**_\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SG_HRM_20200116_069.jpg)\n\nThe next time you\u2019re at McDonald\u2019s, take a look if the staff are wearing pin\nbadges on their uniforms as that\u2019s one of the ways employees are recognised\nfor their good work.\n\nOne of the most coveted pin badges is the recognition pin badge which is given\nto employees who embody the company culture of \u201cWin, Lead and Serve\u201d in their\ncontributions. And I was lucky enough to witness one of the 500 pin badges\nworn by Guest Experience Leader Daliya binti Latiff at the McDonald\u2019s outlet\njust below its office.\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/SG_HRM_20200116_141-250x313.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/SG_HRM_20200116_141.jpg)\n\nGuest Experience Leader Daliya binti Latiff with the recognition pin badge\n\nHowever, recognition at the company goes beyond just pin badges or annual\nawards. It is done on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cWe want to embed the culture of recognizing individuals constantly and\nopenly. And this has to come not just once a year, but on a daily basis,\u201d Hong\nsaid.\n\n\u201cWe have recognition boards at every department with \u2018well done\u2019 notes to\nencourage small wins and appreciation. We want to create an environment of not\njust growth, but recognition. And this is what helps us attract and retain\npeople.\u201d\n\n**Four Legacy Gifts**\n\nIn celebration of its 40th anniversary last year, the company decided to give\nits people four \u2018Legacy Gifts\u2019 \u2013 Gift of Learning, Gift of Recognition, Gift\nof Celebration and Gift of Giving back.\n\nAnd you can tell a company is big on helping its people learn and develop when\nthe first room you see as you enter the office is its Learning and Development\nCentre, which provides not only trainings for new employees, but upskilling\nones as well.\n\n\u201cAll employees from crew to our managers receive training the moment they join\nus so they can be effective and efficient in their work,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere are also continuous trainings where they can be upskilled through\nWorkforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) and SkillsFuture Programmes.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor trainings, we used to have everyone coming to the office, but now we have\ndigitalised our training. We\u2019ve made it available online in video formats,\nwebinars, webcasts, as well as \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d sessions where trainers\nwill bring back what they learnt to the restaurants to train the crew.\u201d\n\nTo put the money where their mouth is, the company has also provided\nopportunities for its employees to further their studies. And it\u2019s not just\ngiving them time off - employees\u2019 courses are fully sponsored without any\nbond.\n\nApril Lee, their youngest restaurant manager at 27 years old, is one of the\nemployees who has benefited from the Gift of Learning, graduating with a\nDiploma in Hospitality from Republic Polytechnic.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fculture-\nof-recognition-at-mcdonalds%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Culture+of+recognition+at+McDonald%27s&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fculture-\nof-recognition-at-mcdonalds%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fculture-\nof-recognition-at-mcdonalds%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

CR's people strategy by advancing an innovative, diverse\nworkforce was a \u201cdream come true.\"\n\nBy: [Maura C. Ciccarelli](https://hrexecutive.com/author/maura-c-ciccarelli/\n\"Posts by Maura C. Ciccarelli\") | February 26, 2020 \u2022 3 min read\n\nTopics: [Career\nDevelopment](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/career-\ndevelopment-talentmanagement/) | [Employee\nRecognition](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/employee-\nrecognition/) |\n[Engagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/engagement/) |\n[HR Leadership](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrleadership/) | [Insights\nfrom a CHRO](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrleadership/insights-from-a-\nchro/) | [Performance\nManagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/performance-\nmanagement/) |\n[Recognition](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/recognition/)\n| [Recruiting](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/recruiting/)\n| [Retention](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/retention/) |\n[Talent Management](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hpb/hpb-top-stories/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/InsightsFromaCHRO.Rafael-P\u00e9rez-700x467.png)\n\nWhen Rafael P\u00e9rez landed his first HR job, at Lockheed Martin, he celebrated\nby buying a brand-new car: a 1997 Dodge Stratus ES, black with gray interiors.\nEight years later, when he and his wife needed a car seat and extra room to\naccommodate their growing family, the choice was a Buick Enclave.\n\nFor the cars and the car seat, he went back to a trusted resource that had\nfueled his passion for cars when he was growing up in Puerto Rico and shaped\nhis ideas of how to get value for his money: _Consumer Reports_.\n\nIn November, he became CHRO at that nonprofit organization, after a career\nthat has also spanned consumer and financial services at Nestl\u00e9 Waters and\nAmerican Express, and strategic-marketing-analytics consulting at start-up\nAnalytic Partners. When he got the opportunity to lead _CR_ \u2019s people strategy\nfor its 500 employees by advancing an innovative and diverse workforce\ncommitted to _CR_ \u2019s mission, he says it was a \u201cdream come true.\u201d\n\n**HRE: How does your personal experience with CR fit into your new role?**\n\n**P\u00e9rez:** I've always had a very personal connection to not only the brand\nbut also the mission. When I look at different milestones in my life journey,\nI never realized until I came across the opportunity at _CR_ just how present\nit was in the background. _CR_ was there for me and my family in those special\nmoments [of major life purchases]. The more I reflected on what I wanted to do\nnext, it really spoke to me to have the opportunity and this broader remit\nthat allows me to draw from different [career] experiences and, at the same\ntime, do it in a place with a social mission that is very connected to who I\nam and what my life trajectory is.\n\n[**Also see:** Eva Sage-Gavin: The 5 elements of responsible\nleadership](https://hrexecutive.com/the-5-elements-of-responsible-leadership/)\n\n_CR_ also shaped my thinking around the idea of ratings\u2014recognizing that, in\ngeneral, they are imperfect, that there are trade-offs and there are multiple\nways in which one could examine the performance of a thing. Down the road, it\nshaped my thinking around [how] human performance could be viewed and\nevaluated through various different lenses to get to an honest picture of what\nis great in a performance and where there are tradeoffs and things that aren't\nquite perfect.\n\n**HRE: What sparked your interest in HR to begin with?**\n\n**P\u00e9rez:** I\u2019ve always been attracted to puzzles. When I came across the\ncurriculum of industrial labor relations, I very quickly found that it really\nis about solving for the entire ecosystem that surrounds human beings in the\nworld of work. So that means that practitioners such as myself weave together\nthoughts, ideas and solutions that run the gamut from organizational behavior\nto labor economics to statistics to collective bargaining and so on. That was\nwhat was attractive to me because it\u2019s my job to work within and through that\ncomplexity to arrive at value added for people and organizations.\n\n**HRE: What HR trends do you see developing in the coming years?**\n\n**P\u00e9rez:** HR is really blossoming as a truly value-added, indispensable part\nof the business. That has meant we are now drawing from different disciplines\nto shape the work that we do.\n\nOne thing that comes to mind is design thinking, which has been helpful in the\nHR profession in thinking about employees as customers. We want to map out the\njourney [of] those experiences we want [employees] to have along the way. It\u2019s\nbeen a very exciting trend to see design thinking emerging as a critical skill\n[and as an] incredible practice for the HR profession.\n\n[**Related:** Pivoting, questioning and always learning: Amy Cappellanti-\nWolf](https://hrexecutive.com/pivoting-questioning-and-always-learning-amy-\ncappellanti-wolf/)\n\nThe other one is leveraging technology and all that comes with it. There\u2019s a\nlot of chatter these days around AI [and] blockchain. The more I get to study\nthose things, the more excited I get. There are some very real possibilities\nto leverage those technologies to not only create efficiencies [but] actually\nimprove how we enable the performance and culture of the organization. One\nexample of bringing that to life is self-serve. Nowadays, HR is better\npositioned to be a special adviser to the business because there is technology\nthat allows us to provide very quick answers and very quick solutions to\nemployees and leaders by leveraging AI. We can personalize the solutions\ndelivery according to need. We can also get information solutions to people\nfaster than relying on manual process. And not only will it enhance the\nemployee experience but it will also enhance our effectiveness.\n\nThere is emerging research on the potential of blockchain in terms of\nmonitoring payment transactions. As we go further into an era of the gig\neconomy, there is going to be greater variation in terms of who gets paid,\nwhat amount and when, and those windows sometimes are shorter and there are\nmultiple windows. That complexity would play well with a solution like\nblockchain because it would allow employers to very seamlessly execute\ntransactions in a way that has excellence, quality and that doesn\u2019t disrupt\nthe fast flow of an organization.\n\nOn the subject of emerging trends, there is a healthy watch out for all of us\nin the profession [to ensure] that we never lose sight of getting the\nfundamentals right. Just because some solution is a new shiny object will not\nalways mean it is relevant or useful to this particular business at this point\nin time.\n\n[In addition to the fundamentals, we need to be] ensuring that whatever we do\nanchors to the strategy of the organization and connects to what the needs\nare. We will always have an obligation to ensure that that connection exists.\nIn a lot of cases it won\u2019t exist and that\u2019s OK, so long as we have put in the\nintellectual due diligence to ensure that are marrying the right solutions in\nthe right way to the right organizational objectives.\n\nI think that the better we get at being that voice of making sure we connect\nto get those things right will allow us to be more credible because we will be\nfocusing on the vital few that matter\u2014as opposed to throwing into the\norganization things that might or might not work. We\u2019ll do the careful but\nquick thinking upfront so that we don\u2019t derail a little bit of that\nperformance and culture that we are tasked with driving.\n\nMaura Ciccarelli is freelance writer based in Southeastern Pennsylvania.

Whether it was through Christmas bonuses, health care\nbenefits, or merely ensuring comfortable chairs at work, there have always\nbeen employers (albeit unknown and uncelebrated) who have tried to drive\nengagement at work. Having been through decades of slow evolution, it is not\nsurprising then that the basic map of employee engagement ideas that work has\nnot changed much.\n\nAre you stuck in age-old ways of engaging your employees?\n\nIs your idea of employee engagement still a boring survey followed by a\ncompulsory \"team activity\"?\n\nIt could often feel like we are drowning in the background noise of the same\nideas, just packaged differently.\n\nWhether we look at reports like Aon Hewitt's Global Trends in Employee\nEngagement, Quantum Workplace's Workplace Trends, or more recent reports like\nDeloitte's [Talent\n2020](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/mx/Documents/about-\ndeloitte/Talent2020_Employee-Perspective.pdf) series, what stands out is that\nin the last decade, there have been certain persistent trends in employee\nengagement.\n\nFor example, over the last decade, there has been a rise in the perceived\nimportance of the employee value proposition and innovation. These facets of\n**[employee experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-experience/)** have now been identified as key\ndrivers of engagement. How valued and supported employees feel has emerged as\nyet another metric that determines levels of engagement, as has the quest for\nmeaningful work.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **The Definitive Guide to AI in Employee\nEngagement**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/definitive-guide-to-ai-employee-engagement/)\n\n## **20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020**\n\nThe trends mentioned above, along with the growing emphasis on **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\nand employee experience, demand not only attention but action as well. So,\nlet's look at 20 fresh employee engagement ideas for 2020.\n\n### **1\\. Celebrate what employees achieve in their downtime**\n\n  \nHR should be mindful of an employee's 360-degree goals and targets, even\noutside the workplace. Someone may be an accomplished artist, chef, or\nmarathon runner \u2013 and recognition in these areas is as important as typical\nworkplace recognition.\n\nAn excellent employee engagement activity for 2020 would be hosting weekly\nmeetups where every employee/team shares stories of their downtime pursuits,\nwhat they have achieved and future hopes/goals.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How to Engage Employees in 2020: 10 Impactful\nSolutions**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-\nto-engage-employees-impactful-\nsolutions/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=4962&zd_term=prarthanaghosh)\n\n### **2\\. Upgrade communications to include video**\n\n  \nYour upgraded intranets, frequent mailers, and a cake-for-every-occasion can\nonly take you so far. They will not crack the code to the ultimate employee\nexperience. To truly provide the fabled \"holistic experience for a\nmultigenerational workforce,\" you must crack the video code.\n\nEvery employee is a consumer, and if video content works better for your\nexternal customers, it would work for your internal customers too.\n\nA video is also an excellent tool for pan-company announcements and to engage\nwith your deskless workforce, your gig workers, and your remote workers.\n\nEveryone loves a bit of the limelight, and broadcasting short culture-centric\nvideos of real employees speaking about their achievements and aspirations\nhelps to build a strong connection with the rest of your workforce. For people\nwho don't come to headquarters every day, videos can help them feel connected\nwith their teams and give them a sense of belonging and engagement.\n\n### **3\\. Give your pulse surveys a makeover**\n\n  \nWith Google Forms and SurveyMonkey, you can create pulse surveys with ease and\ncustomize them to suit your needs. But who says that a survey needs to look\nand feel like a survey? Ticking through boxes of endless options and choosing\nnumbers on a Likert scale are not the only way that your employees can tell\nyou how engaged they are.\n\nYou could ask for short WhatsApp voice notes not more than 20 seconds long \u2013\nan easy investment for your employees and for you \u2013 that encapsulates how the\nweek went. You could even do the same by asking them to upload a picture a\nweek.\n\nEmployees could also take a quick mood test, or engagement analytics tools\nthat study search trends within work systems that could give you a glimpse of\nthe general mood throughout the organization.\n\n### **4\\. Implement a non-anonymized survey to measure the engagement**\n\n  \nAnonymizing the results of an **[employee engagement\nsurvey](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nan-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-examples/)** has\nalways been a best practice. And this continues to hold for more formal\nsurveys, where you measure company-wide engagement/satisfaction levels. But\nyou could also implement a non-anonymized survey for small teams and employee\ngroups.\n\nMake this a fun employee engagement activity \u2013 hand out post-its after a\nmeeting where employees can jot down their feedback with a clear signature.\nThis will help them take ownership of feedback and feel like they are being\nheard as individuals, and not as an anonymized voice in a dataset.\n\n### **5\\. Enable remote working**\n\n  \nThe modern office is not a place but a function, and in our age of instant\n(and constant!) connectivity, this function could be carried out from\nanywhere. If your company policy does not allow a work-from-home option, it\ncosts you the chance to hire and engage a massive variety of diverse talent.\n\nIt is not just millennials who demand remote working tools and flexible\nculture. While they would make up 75% of the workforce by 2020, the minority\ngenerations at work would benefit as well.\n\nCreating a culture that is anytime-anywhere (by using collaborative systems\nlike Slack, easy video-calling solutions, and ensuring regular check-ins)\nmakes your mobile workforce feel valued and trusted.\n\nThat is a sure boost to engagement because then work becomes a more enjoyable\nexercise where employees' values, goals, and vision can coexist with those of\nthe organization.\n\n### **6\\. But say goodbye to the always-on culture for a week every quarter**\n\n  \nIt isn't always possible to switch off every time we step out of the office \u2013\nbut you could make it a mandate for at least one week a quarter, where\nemployees must remain unavailable outside of work hours. Convey clearly that\nno one should expect a response to an email or an instant message during this\nweek once the employee has left for the day.\n\nActivities like these are critical to reduce burnout and ensure that employees\nare adequately refreshed to maintain optimal productivity levels. They also\nhelp employees feel cared for, just like the company's customers.\n\n### **7\\. Encourage employees to become company brand ambassadors**\n\n  \nYour employer brand needs storytellers. Cultivating a band of employee brand\nambassadors serves a two-fold purpose \u2013 fostering a strong sense of pride and\nbelongingness within employees and building a credible employer brand that\ncandidates, clients, and external points of contact can believe in.\n\nWith employees being active contributors on platforms like Snapchat,\nInstagram, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor, the art of branded storytelling can be\nmore effective and is more critical than ever before. A lot of millennials\nespecially engage while engaging others and thrive in an environment that\nallows them to express their views and opinions on social platforms.\n\n### **8\\. Invest in gamification at different levels of the employee\nlifecycle**\n\n  \nWe've all heard of how gamified candidate selection or gamified corporate\nlearning has been creating ripples. But often, considerable shifts in\ntechnology and strategy are usually a \"them\" change before they become an \"us\"\nchange.\n\nWhile new-age technology can help you elevate gamification, you could put\ngamified processes to use even without futuristic tech. Game-based learning\nnot only boosts productivity levels, but also brings in a note of fun that\nencourages a bit of friendly competition, enhances collaboration, and elevates\nthe drive to succeed.\n\nYou could assign a day for some trivia quizzed on general knowledge and the\ncompany's brand or have a monthly tournament of Chess or Settlers of Catan,\nwhere teams have to collaborate strategically. Introducing relevant games such\nas these into the company culture would only enhance the overall employee\nexperience.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Employee Engagement vs. Employee Experience: Are They\nReally That Different?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-engagement-vs-employee-experience-are-they-different/)\n\n### **9\\. Offer a two-way mentorship program across departments**\n\n  \nTwo-way mentorship programs are an excellent strategy for upskilling and\nemployee engagement. They open up employees to new areas of learning and can\nserve as the key to unlocking hidden talent. It also helps employees\nunderstand their role in the larger organization.\n\nFor example, consider a two-way mentorship between a software developer and a\nmarketer. The former gets to know how their product is positioned in the\nmarket, while the latter receives a hands-on idea of the product they are\nmarketing. In the long-term, this strategy also has the potential to bolster\nyour productivity levels.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n### **10\\. Host frequent workshops**\n\n  \nAs adults, we tend to be averse to stepping outside our comfort zones and\nlearning new things. That is where fun workshops can shake things up.\nMoreover, this does not necessarily entail having to scour the market for\nexpensive coaches. You could source expertise internally as well.\n\nFor example, similar to the mentorship program, one of the coders could take a\ntwo-day workshop on basic HTML so that everyone in the product development\nteam knows what goes on in the backend. Workshops could also be engaging\nbrainstorming sessions or fun ideas like cocktail-making or baking that help\npeople get out of their routine while making them connect the balance of\ndifferent ingredients in a cocktail or a cake to the need for diversity at\nwork, for example.\n\n![employee engagement ideas](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. 20 fresh employee engagement ideas for 2020**\n\n### **11\\. Check your team's alignment to the organization's vision**\n\n  \nThe why of the organization \u2013 why it exists, why we do things the way we do\nthem, or why we wish to achieve one goal before another \u2013 is something that\nevery employee needs to understand and be on board with before they can truly\nbe engaged at work.\n\nVision alignment or being in sync with the vision of the organization is an\nessential pillar of engagement, and employees need to feel that the work that\nthey do matters and adds fuels the mission of the company.\n\nThe values and vision of the organization cannot exist merely on paper and\nwall-decals \u2013 they need to be lived every day. To do this, there should be\nenough scope for every employee to internalize what the organization stands\nfor and to align their own goals with organizational goals.\n\n### **12\\. Create an annual report of employee achievements**\n\n  \nAt the end of every year, companies publish a formalized annual report that\nshares its progress, achievements, and issues with the public. You can also\ntry a similar activity to increase employee engagement in 2020.\n\nReview performance data to find areas of outstanding performance \u2013 this could\nbe hard skills leading to business results, or soft skills that positively\nimpacted the work environment. Represent this data in a visual format, using\ncharts, infographics, badges, etc. This will encourage similar results and\nhigher productivity in the new year.\n\n### 13\\. Involve the entire company when onboarding new hires\n\nThis is particularly relevant for small-to-mid-sized businesses. Even large\nenterprises and 100% remote companies can leverage digital technology to\ngarner participation from every employee when someone new joins the company.\n\nHold a monthly onboarding day where the entire workforce gathers to welcome\nnew hires. You could also initiate a Slack thread called \"Hello! Let me tell\nyou about myself,\" where current employees (from interns to C-leaders) can\ntell the new hire something interesting about themselves. This will ensure\nthat employees are primed for engagement right from day one.\n\nBesides, for remote workers, instead of sending across the link to a recorded\nonboarding session, send them shorter video messages from team leaders and\ntheir teammates to inspire them.\n\n### **14\\. Invest in wellness at work**\n\n  \nA [report by Humana](https://www.humana.com/employer/group-benefits-101/after-\nenrollment/manage-employee-benefits/the-wellness-effect-the-impact-of-\nworkplace-programs/') called \"The Wellness Effect: The Impact of Workplace\nPrograms\" found that employee engagement and wellness are closely related. 67%\nof employees in organizations that prioritize wellness said that they felt\nmore engaged with the values and vision of the organization.\n\nWellness at work does not have to be a compulsory yoga class. Wellness\nincorporates within its umbrella physical, social, emotional, and financial\nwellness. Your wellness plan needs to be able to cater to all these aspects\nthat cumulatively ensure the holistic health of an employee.\n\nThere is also a need to destigmatize mental health challenges that many\nemployees could be facing but feel uncomfortable to ask about. Building\nsystems in place for decreasing workplace stress is more than an absolute\nnecessity.\n\nThis is an opportunity to help your employees understand that you care for\ntheir well-being, not merely to gain more productivity, but because that is\nwhat the organization believes in. Better performance is often just the\nbyproduct of a healthy workplace.\n\n### **15\\. Revamp rewards and recognition**\n\n  \nUsing AI to revamp rewards and recognition (R&R;) programs based on employee\nfeedback is a good way to get them more engaged. Employee engagement award\nideas that focus on rewarding behaviors that the organization values create a\nsense of achievement for being in tune with the culture at work. The process\nfor nomination or voting for this should be fair and objective. This helps\nfurther the cause of engagement.\n\nGiving out fun awards like the messiest-desk-but-gets-the-job-done, marbles\nunder their feet award, or an award for always thinking outside the box are a\ngreat way to get people to enjoy the process while also feeling valued and\nappreciated for what they do.\n\n### **16\\. Make diversity and inclusion the norm**\n\n  \nDiversity and inclusion is yet another facet of work that needs to become more\nthan just a mandate. It would be a fresh change for your employees to see the\norganization becoming more diverse. An environment that is an amalgamation of\ncultural, gender, and [generational\ndiversity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/the-need-for-\ngenerational-diversity-in-workplace/) is perceived to be alive and\ninteresting, and employees of all stripes thrive there.\n\nMoreover, a culture that is sensitive to the needs thought patterns, and\nideologies of individuals from different cultures, backgrounds, and\ngenerations are automatically more engaging.\n\nTo truly promote inclusivity, your organizational culture needs to allow every\nvoice to be heard. This involves allowing expression to individuals from\nminority groups and those more prone to being discriminated against.\n\nWhile taking the human out of certain screening processes could do away with\nbias, installing feedback loop portals at work that address diversity issues\nlike 15Five, OfficeVibe and CultureAmp help in setting a mechanism in place\nfor employees to express their voice at work. Besides ensuring a better mix of\nideas and perspectives, inclusivity at work also makes employees feel valued\nas individuals and not just a member of a specific group.\n\n### **17\\. Encourage work-life balance**\n\n  \nWe live in a world where attaining a [work-life\nbalance](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/four-\nways-ai-is-improving-worklife-balance/) is still considered a victory, whereas\nit should be the norm. A regular working day should be one in which you get as\nmuch time for yourself and your family as you do for work. The idea is to\ncreate a schedule in which you do not feel like you are at a constant tug of\nwar between your duties at work and all that you want to accomplish outside of\nwork\n\nMaking employees always put in extra time and effort at work will lead to not\nonly burnout but also a noticeable dip in engagement. This is truer now when\nwe can always be connected to work, and where it could often be a challenge to\nswitch off our internal work mode.\n\nA transparent, open, and enabling culture would allow employees to share their\nvoice out in case they do feel that managing work and life is becoming\ndifficult. Interventions should then be arranged to find out where the problem\nlies and to make employees feel that they are not alone in their struggle.\n\n[Voice-of-the-employee\ntechnology](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-voice-of-the-employee-technology/), individualized [employee assistance\nprograms](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/benefits-administration/how-\nemployee-assistance-programs-improve-workplace-mental-health/) (EAPs), and\nguided group counseling sessions are some resources that could be put in place\nto create a culture that is inherently enabling and supportive.\n\n### **18\\. Plan creative CSR programs**\n\n  \nA [2019\nstudy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283129700_Impact_of_corporate_social_responsibility_on_employee_engagement_A_case_of_Eskom_in_South_Africa/link/5a1f68e5aca272cbfbc2f166/download)\nfinds that employee engagement and corporate social responsibility (CSR) work\ntogether to achieve organizational goals. It also found that business success\nwas partly driven by employee engagement arising from CSR.\n\nA [study by Kenexa Research Institute](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-\nrelease/2008/09/11/1225374/0/en/The-Kenexa-Research-Institute-Reveals-Exactly-\nHow-Engaged-Employees-Are-and-What-Exactly-Employee-Engagement-Means.html)\nfurther asserts that how employees rate their pride in the organization, their\nlevel of satisfaction at work, and their willingness to recommend their\norganization to others is impacted by how they feel about the kind of work\nthat the organization does to give back to society.\n\nA genuine focus on CSR and [sustainability at\nwork](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/4-tips-to-create-a-\nculture-of-sustainability-in-the-workplace/) and can help build a personal\nconnection between the organization, the employee and the society while also\nharboring a sense of gratification in being able to add value to society at\nlarge.\n\n### **19\\. Upgrade your EVP**\n\n  \nEmployee value proposition (EVP) and **[employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/)** are closely related and both fall on the employee\nsatisfaction/happiness spectrum. EVP plays a part in how the employee\nperceives the employer brand right from the first telephonic interview until\ntheir last day and their direct impact on the employees' level of engagement\nand involvement at work.\n\nNow is the time to upgrade your EVP \u2013 the promise that you make to your\nemployees. In a market as riddled with dynamism and as wrecked with the\ncompetition, it is always helpful to take a step back and analyze what sets\nyou apart.\n\nWhat is the USP of the employee experience that you are promising? How can you\ndeliver better on this promise and make your employees want to be engaged?\n\nAnswering these questions will help you move towards engagement practices that\nare more organic and less transactional.\n\n### **20\\. Empower line managers to own employee engagement**\n\n  \nIt is time to delegate the onus of employee engagement to individuals beyond\nHR. [A white paper by Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/whos-\nresponsible-for-employee-engagement/') shows that companies like Rackspace,\nAT&T;, Progressive Insurance, Intuit, and Cintas reported better engagement\nnumbers when line managers took charge of leading employee engagement instead\nof HR managers.\n\nThis is an important finding suggesting that business leads can empower\nsupervisors and hold them accountable for the engagement of their teams while\ncreating a steady feedback loop.\n\nThe onus of employee engagement should be divided between the HR, line\nmanagers, the individual employee, and senior leaders. Top-down commitment\nacross all departments is necessary to encourage employees' commitment.\n\nMoreover, employees would automatically feel more engaged if they were made a\npart of the decisions regarding employee engagement and felt that their\nopinions mattered.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **15 Essential Employee Satisfaction Survey Questions for\nYour 2020 Questionnaire**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-satisfaction-survey-\nquestions/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=4962&zd_term=prarthanaghosh)\n\n## **From Theory to Practice**\n\nA [study by Gallup ](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236927/employee-\nengagement-drives-growth.aspx)found that teams that are deeply engaged are 21%\nmore productive. That's not all \u2013 Other research finds that investing just 10%\nmore in employee engagement can boost profits by $2,400 per employee annually.\n\nHow do you know whether your employee engagement ideas and activities are\nworking? Here are a few KPIs and questions that would help:\n\n**1\\. Engagement beyond work:** How many employees work outside regular\nworking hours (e.g., evenings and weekends)? Is this a good indicator of their\nown initiative, or were they asked to put in extra hours?\n\n**2\\. Broader corporate-social networks:** How many network connections does\nthe average employee have? How much time is spent with people outside of the\nimmediate team or region? This is a good indicator since passively disengaged\nemployees tend to have smaller social networks.\n\n**3\\. Participation without obligations:** What is the percentage of\nparticipation in ad-hoc meetings and initiatives that are unplanned and\nunstructured as opposed to recurring meetings and group events? For example,\ndo more employees attend team meetings where they feel attendance is mandatory\nas opposed to casual team lunches?\n\n**4\\. Branded communications:** Is any time spent in collaborating directly\nwith customers or outsiders beyond the normal scope of work? How are these\ninteractions? Is the company brand upheld with pride?\n\nThe KPIs and questions above are ones that you should keep an eye on.\n\nEmployee engagement activities must blend into a broader strategy and your\ncompany's culture to be truly effective. Without this, you are left with what\nJoelle Kaufman (CMO at Dynamic Signal) calls \"fireworks and smoke.\"\n\n\"One common mistake is what I call 'the fireworks and the smoke.' When it gets\nstarted, there's a lot of excitement, swag, a party. But a few weeks later,\nthe fireworks are over and there's just smoke. This is not a program or a\ncampaign. It's a fundamental way of operating. If you want to engage\nemployees, you have to be consistently putting out content that solicits\nengagement. It can't be just fireworks and smoke,\" she\n[said](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/employee-engagement/building-\na-culture-of-organizational-engagement-in-conversation-with-joelle-kaufman-\ncmo-at-dynamic-signal/).\n\nEmployee engagement initiatives should go beyond protecting the bottom line \u2013\nthey should be a way of life at work.\n[Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236927/employee-engagement-drives-\ngrowth.aspx) reported 37% less absenteeism, 90% less turnover, and 28% less\nsafety incidents in organizations with higher employee engagement scores.\n\nIf you find yourself stuck for new ways to improve engagement levels in your\norganization, give these ideas a shot. Remember to measure their effectiveness\nand keep modifying the concept to suit your employees' needs.\n\n**_Do you have any innovative employee engagement ideas?
