These new-age HRTech tools are now helping enterprises hire, train,\nengage and retain employees better, with a strong focus on increasing\n\u201cemployee experience\u201d and \u201corganizational productivity\u201d.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834c096babe.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n**HR News:**[VCV Launches AI-Powered Platform to Simplify the Hiring\nProcess](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/recruitment-onboarding/vcv-\nlaunches-aipowered-platform-to-simplify-hiring-process/)\n\nSingapore has traditionally been seen as a laggard in HRTech adoption, but the\nscenario has been fast-changing over the last two years. This demand for HR\ntechnologies has been further accelerated in recent times due to the COVID-19\noutbreak, as Singapore enterprises are looking to digitalize their HR\nfunctions to support remote working.\n\nThe details of all these providers have been published in the recently\nreleased 2020 Singapore HRTech Market Map, a comprehensive and collaborative\nresearch product of Adrian Tan, renowned HRTech blogger, and [hr\ntech.sg](https://www.hrtech.sg/), a Singapore-based boutique HRTech advisory,\nand analyst firm. Incidentally, Both Adrian Tan and hr tech.sg had worked\ntogether on the [2019 Market Map](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/digital-\ntransformation/2019-singapore-hrtech-market-map-unveiled-a-\nrecord-160-specialised-local-and-overseas-hrtech-providers-servicing-the-\nsingapore-talent-marketplace/) also, which was widely acclaimed for his\ncomprehensive coverage of the categories and players.\n\nA step further, the 2020 Singapore HR Tech Market Map has seen the addition of\nnewer HR categories and subcategories to help HR Professionals and Enterprises\nchoose the vendors in line with their specific needs.\n\nThe 2020 market map has been categorized the service providers across EIGHT\nmajor Talent segments: Talent Acquisition (Applicant Tracking System;\nSourcing\u00beJob Boards, Referrals, Tech Hiring, Non-PMET; Screening\u00beAssessments,\nVideo Interviews, Background Check), Talent Engagement (Employee\nCommunication; Onboarding; Performance Management), Talent Development\n(Coaching & Mentoring; Competency Management), Talent Operations **** (HR\nAutomation & Bots; Payroll), Talent Rewards (Benefits, Wellness, Compensation\nManagement), Talent Analytics, Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS\nEnterprise and SMB\u2019s) and Talent Planning.\n\n\u201cThe need of the hour for HR functions is to aggressively adopt HRTech. This\nwill not only help the HR teams to solve pressing business challenges and use\nbudgets more efficiently, but it also improves candidate and employee\nexperience too. And notably, it frees up bandwidth for HR teams to focus on\nmore strategic initiatives\u201d, says Adrian Tan.\n\n\u201cEnterprises that focus on HRTech as part of their transformational agenda are\ncreating sustainable economic value and better workplace experience for their\nemployees. Singapore enterprises should now leverage the Resilience Budget\nprovisions unveiled in the Parliament recently by Singapore\u2019s Deputy Prime\nMinister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, and other government programs\nsuch as IMDA\u2019s Singapore Digital (SG:D) initiative to digitalize their HR\nfunction\u201d, adds Sriram Iyer, CEO, hr tech.sg.\n\nOrganizations around the world are widely adopting systems from enterprise\nsoftware providers as well as specialized HR tech vendors, depending on their\nspecific workplace requirements.\n\n**HR News:**[The Era of Passwords at Work Ends With the Release of Okta\nFastpass](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/hr-tech-news/the-era-of-\npasswords-at-work-ends-with-the-release-of-okta-fastpass/)\n\n![2020 Singapore HR Tech Market Map](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=HR+Technology+Service+Providers+Aim+at+Digital+Transformation\n\"Share this News on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=HR+Technology+Service+Providers+Aim+at+Digital+Transformation&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this News on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this News on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this News on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-email-\nicon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=HR Technology Service Providers Aim at Digital\nTransformation&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fhr-technology-service-providers-aim-at-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this News via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Digital Transformation ](/category/digital-\ntransformation/ \"Digital Transformation\")\n\n  * [ ![Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/shutterstock_1134410339_5db306fad1860.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-special-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-\nspecial-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe future of work is uncertain, and the fear of AI taking over work is real.\nBut there\u2019s more to it, as expressed by some HR leaders we spoke to.\n\nby [Puja Lalwani](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/puja-\nlalwani-1/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Oct 25, 2019\n\n  * [ ![How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process \\(and How It Won\u2019t\\)](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/ai_in_recruitment_5da994c5c9d8b.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-and-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-wont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process (and How It Won\u2019t)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-\nand-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-\nwont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nWe hear a lot about AI\u2019s effect on jobs, but what about its effect on\nrecruiters?

As an organization's most significant\nasset, employees hired must be satisfied, motivated, developed, and retained.\nAn organization\u2019s human resource policies play a very important role in this.\n\nCosmo Films took up HR transformation to create systems and processes which\nproved to be enablers for the company\u2019s journey to becoming an Employer of\nChoice. Some of the processes that we have improved upon in order to define a\nclear focus on capability building, keeping our employees at the core are-\n\n1\\. Performance appraisals\n\n2\\. Recruitment processes\n\n3\\. Compensation and benefits\n\n4\\. Employee engagement\n\n5\\. Employee life cycle\n\n6\\. Rewards & Recognition\n\n7\\. Background checks and verifications\n\n8\\. Automation of HR through implementing SAP\u2019s Success Factor\n\nOne of the major areas that we have worked towards in the past year is\nEmployee Engagement and its 4 pillars through the medium of automated HR. Let\nus discuss them in some detail-\n\n **Employee Engagement**\n\nEmployee Engagement is one of the key focus areas for the company, and we have\ndesigned a very robust and comprehensive engagement model based on the\nfindings of engagement survey of 2017. Engagement is also done by way of\ncapability building, innovative methods of resourcing and culture change. With\nthis systemic and strategic approach, various activities are being carried out\nin the company to boost employee engagement. The engagement model is based on\nfour pillars which are-\n\n **Career Opportunities:-** An employee has clear defined visibility on\nknowledge, skill & attributes required for his position as well as the role\nhe/she would aspire to be in and requisite resources for his/her career\nplanning. On this front, we have recently launched a Career Progression\nModule, where we identify good talent within the organization and give them a\nboost in their career through training and interdisciplinary assignments. This\ntalent would be identified on the basis of past ratings and would be defined\nunder two major categories- The High Performers (HiPOS) and the Top Guns.\nWhere the HiPOS would be identified on the basis of excellent performance in\nthree consecutive quarters, the Top Guns would be identified with consistently\nexcellent performance in at least three quarters in their career at Cosmo\nFilms.\n\n **Reward & Recognition:- **Reward & Recognition System is aimed to accelerate\nthe pace of the employee performance in the most competitive way, ensuring\nhealthy completion to go the extra mile for the organization and get rewarded\nby an utmost transparent method. We have a very comprehensive system in place\nto identify deserving employees and reward them with several recognitions like\nSales Incentive Plan, Chairman\u2019s Award, CEO Award and monthly & quarterly\nincentives.\n\n **Empowerment and Authority:-** This is a cultural shift that is being\ninitiated by way of Empowerment & Autonomy by bringing a manager driven\nculture. Transparency is being built between the employee and their managers\nto reward the efforts of the employee by the most objective Performance\nManagement Systems. We have divided our system into three different E\u2019s-\nEnable, Empower and Excel.\n\na. Enable: Creating a culture that gives recognition, competency development\nopportunities, a healthy and safe working environment, and a process-driven\nculture.\n\nb. Empower: Giving employees a degree of autonomy and responsibility for\ndecision-making regarding their specific organizational tasks.\n\nc. Excel: To perform our responsibilities entrusted by the organization\nexceptionally well. Outstanding practices in managing the organization and\nachieving superior results.\n\n4\\. Supervision:- Competencies reflected in the employees are impacted by way\nof Supervisory Development Training, which is included in a new employee\ninduction program, buddy programs, technical as well as behavioral training-\non and off the job, development programs and plant visits for people working\nat remote locations. Additionally, some other initiatives started in the\ncompany, contributing towards a cultural change and capability building are-\n\n **Introduction of Human Resource Business Partner Concept: -** Now there are\ndedicated HR executives in the company who are closely working with all the\nvertical heads on their business requirements, various issues and concerns;\nand extending the support for smooth day to day operations.\n\n **Moving employees to the next level through Digital HR Practices:-** In the\ncurrent working environment, we have made it easy for employees to access HR\nservices and data from anywhere across the world with our automated HR through\nthe medium of Cosmo Intranet and SAP Success Factor. This is accessible to all\nemployees not only on their laptops but also through their smartphones.\n\n **Recruitment of Female Employees:-** In our plant in Shendra, Aurangabad,\nfemale Graduate Engineers are being recruited as GEL (Graduate Engineer\nLearners). They have done various good projects with us and given important\ninputs for the improvement in operations.\n\n **Launch of Cosmo Global Competencies:-** Cosmo Global competencies were\nlaunched in 2017 for all the employees and detailed training was given on 08\ncompetencies which should be acquired by all employees.\n\nWith these revisions and structures now in place, Cosmo Films has been able to\ncreate a viable working environment for its employees, and also placed the\ncompany as a great place to work for.\n\nDisclaimer: _The views expressed in the article above are those of the\nauthors' and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of this\npublishing house_\n\n* * *\n\n**Share this article:**\n\n**Tags assigned to this article:**\n\n[Vipul Dave](/tags/Vipul-Dave-107296/) [Cosmo Films ltd.](/tags/Cosmo-Films-\nltd.-107297/) [COVID-19](/tags/COVID-19-105499/) [coronavirus\noutbreak](/tags/coronavirus-outbreak-103398/)\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Around The World\n\nAdvertisement\n\n### Socialize\n\nGet Social!

The application sought to insert a new schedule to provide for\naward flexibility on a temporary basis.\n\nThe FWC acknowledged that the recent Government announcements in response to\nCOVID-19 would likely have a substantial impact on employers and employees in\nthe hospitality sector. The FWC determined that the variation was necessary to\nachieve the modern award objective and to ensure the retention of as many\nemployees as practicable in the current crisis.\n\nThe determination varies the Hospitality Award to insert 'Schedule L \u2013 Award\nflexibility during the COVID-19 Pandemic.' The award variation commenced on 24\nMarch 2020 and will operate until 30 June 2020. The Schedule allows employers\nto make the following directions:\n\n  * For employees to perform duties outside the scope of their classification subject to the duties being within their skill and competency, being safe and the employee being licensed and qualified to perform them, and the Higher Duties provision in the Hospitality Award;\n  * For full-time employees to work fewer hours (an average of between 22.8 and 38 ordinary hours per week) and the employer will pay the employee on a pro rata basis;\n  * For part-time employees to work fewer hours (an average of between 60% and 100% of their guaranteed hours per week or the guaranteed hours per week over the roster cycle); and\n  * For employees to take annual leave with 24 hours' notice, subject to the employer considering the employee's personal circumstances.\n\nEmployees that are directed to work fewer hours will continue to accrue annual\nand personal leave based on the employee's ordinary hours of work prior to the\ncommencement of the Schedule. Employees that take annual or personal leave\nwill also be paid leave based on their ordinary hours of work prior to the\ncommencement of the Schedule.\n\nWhile employers can direct employees to take annual leave, this does not\nprevent an employer and employee agreeing to the employee taking annual leave.\nBy agreement between the employer and employee, during the operation of the\nSchedule, an employee may take twice as much leave at half the rate of pay for\nthe period of annual leave.\n\nAccess the FWC's determination and Schedule L [\nhere](https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/documents/awardmod/variations/2020/pr717757.pdf).\n\nAccess the reasons for the FWC's decision [\nhere](https://www.fwc.gov.au/documents/documents/awardmod/variations/2020/2020fwcfb1574.pdf).\n\n### Proposed Clerk Award changes in response to COVID-19\n\nOn 26 March 2020, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( **ACCI** )\nand the Australian Industry Group ( **AI Group** ), with the support of the\nAustralian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Services Union, made a\njoint application to the FWC to vary the _Clerks \u2013 Private Sector 2010_ (\n**Clerks Award** ). Similar to the above application, the ACCI and AI Group\nare seeking to include a new schedule in response to COVID-19.\n\nThe application seeks to vary the Clerks Award by inserting 'Schedule I \u2013\nAward flexibility during the COVID-19 Pandemic.' The Schedule would make the\nfollowing flexibility changes:\n\n  * For employees to perform duties within their skill and competency regardless of their classification, provided the duties are safe and the employee is licensed and qualified to perform them;\n  * For employers to roster part-time employees working from home by agreement for a minimum of two consecutive hours on any shift, and for casual employees working from home by agreement to be entitled to a minimum payment of two hours' work at the appropriate rate;\n  * For the spread of ordinary hours for day workers to be between 6.00am and 11.00pm, Monday to Friday, and between 7.00am and 12.30pm on Saturday, for employees working from home by agreement with the employer;\n  * For employers and full-time and part-time employees to agree to reduced ordinary hours;\n  * For employers and employees to agree to the taking of up to twice as much annual leave at a proportionately reduced rate;\n  * For employers to direct an employee to take accrued annual leave with at least one week's notice or on shorter notice if agreed; and\n  * For employers to require employees to take annual leave as part of a close down, or for employees who have not accrued sufficient leave to take paid annual leave for the part of the close down for which they have accrued leave and unpaid leave for the remainder of the close down.\n\nThe application is listed for hearing on 28 March 2020.\n\nAccess the application [ here](https://www.fwc.gov.au/awards-and-\nagreements/awards/award-modernisation/variation-\napplications/AM2020/10?type=variation&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Award%20matters&utm_content=Award%20matters+CID_e07acc680d91baf2acb11beb562c7aa3&utm_source=campaign%20monitor&utm_term=AM202010%20-%20Clerks%20-%20Private%20Sector%20Award%202010).\n\n### What next?\n\nGiven the widespread impact of COVID-19 on employers and employees, we\nanticipate that other unions and employer associations will make applications\nto vary other modern awards. Employers should stay informed of any award\nchanges to assist with the management of their employees during this time.\n\nWe will publish further information about variations to other modern awards.\n\n_The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the\nsubject matter.

Adaptation and agility have become a necessary skills\nevery human resources professional (and even those not in HR) is using to\ncarry out their normal business functions.  But those aren't the only skills\nthey're seeing emerge within their colleagues or even those employees working\nfor their respective companies.\n\nIn fact, there are a whole host of new leadership competencies coming to bare.\nSome more than others.  Regardless, HR professionals are having to call upon\ntheir ability to adapt in an effort to assimilate these new competencies into\ntheir own tool kits and embrace and nurture them in their company's employees.\n\n# Emerging Leadership Competencies\n\n## The Research\n\nIn our [State of HR](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/reports/the-state-of-hr) report released in December 2019, we asked\nHR professionals around the globe a series of questions.  One of those related\nto the concept of emerging leadership competencies.  We asked respondents to\nthink about the multigenerational workforce and pick those competencies they\nsee as being the most prevalent.\n\nThe results are in the graph below:\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/sohr_4_2.jpg)\n\nThe top three were:\n\n  1. Innovative Thinking\n  2. Technology Knowledge\n  3. Multigenerational Organizational Skills\n\nWhat's significant about these results?  These three traits, and the others\nchosen by respondents, define what HR should expect from future workers in\nterms of ability.  Additionally, the majority of the traits are soft skills.\nAs HR Exchange Network editor Mason Stevenson wrote in the report\u2026\n\n\"HR recognizes it's not enough to just have technical expertise.  Workers must\nalso be able to interact effectively with other people.  The human component\nis once again taking precedence over an employee's skill with a particular\ntool.  This new class of worker must be able to communicate effectively.\nCompanies that don't embrace these skills will increase their risks of falling\nbehind competitors.\"\n\nFor the purposes of this article, let's take a look at the top three in more\ndetail.\n\n### Innovative Thinking\n\nAvish Parashar is a motivational speaker.  His definition of innovative\nthinking really breaks down the concept in an easy to understand way.  He says\ninnovative thinking is \"to think up something new, or to think about something\nold in a new way.\"  That is not only necessary for HR professionals, but it is\na common trait in Millennial and Generation Z employees.\n\n#### Nurturing Innovative Thinking\n\n[In his blog](http://dinghappens.com/innovation/innovative-thinking/),\nParashar outlines several ways leaders can foster this trait and nurture in\ntheir employees.\n\n  * > **Inspire people to think out of their box.** Play different games that promote innovative thinking and let people know you respect every thought they have.\n\n  * > **Award thoughts, not people.** If there is someone who deserves to be appreciated, don't hold back. Even receiving a simple certificate would invite more innovative thinking by others.\n\n  * > **Award attempts, not only results.  **We live in a results-driven world, and mot rewards are given to the people with the best results. That seems fair. The challenge is that innovation often comes after failure. If you only reward results, people will be discouraged from trying new things that may not work. Keep rewarding great results, but also add in some recognition for those who are attempting innovation.\n\n  * > **Don 't Discount Ideas.**Appreciate the efforts of every person who comes up with a thought not previously shared. It's possible you'll find some ideas to be completely nonsense, but this is how you dig through the coal to get diamonds.\n\n  * > **Create a \"Thought Box.\"**Place a box in the office and let everyone put their ideas into it whenever they want to. This can be anonymous so people will be freer in their ideas.\n\n### Technology Knowledge\n\nEmployees today are very knowledgeable when it comes to technology.  Just look\nat the traits often associated with Millennials and Generation Z adults.\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/gen_y_and_gen_7.jpg)\n\nBoth are technologically savvy.  That's not to say other generations don't\nhave an interest in technology or have technology knowledge of their own.\nThis is just a generalization.  That said, when it comes to this topic,\nGeneration Z employees have a leg up.\n\nGeneration Z is the first real group of digital natives.  Most of them can't\nremember a time before smartphones and tablets or even social media.  Some\nhave joked this generation was practically born with a tablet in-hand.  And it\nreally defines the generation when you consider other characteristics.\n\nGen Zers have built in expectations when it comes to access to information in\ntheir personal lives, and they extend that to their professional lives.\n\n> To read more about Generation Z, check out our Rise of Gen Z article series.\n> [Click here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\n> management/articles/rise-of-generation-z-what-hr-should-know) to read Part\n> I.\n\n### Multigenerational Organizational Skills\n\nAccording to a [Forbes\narticle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennagoudreau/2013/02/14/how-to-\ncommunicate-in-the-new-multigenerational-office/#35abeff4a6b4), the average\nworkplace houses up to four different generations.  Some house all five.\nRegardless of the size of the organization, HR and leadership must recognize\nthat each generation has its own set of skills and has a lot to offer in terms\nof those skills and experience.  The way to really organize this and make it\nwork for the company is through the workplace culture.  This culture must be\nset up to embrace these varying skills and experiences.  Doing so will lead to\nmore productivity and engagement among workers.\n\nWhen thinking about culture, especially where the varying generations applies,\nkeep a few things in mind.  A company culture should be:\n\n  1. Richly Diverse\n  2. Innovative\n  3. Open to dissent\n  4. Transparent\n  5. Aligned with the company brand\n  6. Supported by all, especially leadership\n  7. Aligns with strategy and process\n\nMore on these concepts can be found\n[here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/articles/workplace-culture-hrs-guide-to-implementation).\n\n## In Summation\n\nThere are many emerging leadership competencies not outlined in this article.\nIt doesn't mean they are any less important.  Regardless though, every HR\nprofessional and leader should keep an open mind when it comes to these\ncompetencies.  That includes coming up with a plan or strategy to deal with\neach.  And be prepared to change course to adapt as more Generation Z workers\ncome into the fold and more Baby Boomers and Generation X workers leave the\nworkforce.  The key is to find the balance between these competencies and then\nmaintain that balance at all times.\n\n\n\n**_Want more content faster?   Connect with us on Twitter, Facebook and\nLinkedIn.

In fact, when Human Resources Online asked HR leaders to rate the\nimportance of employee health and wellbeing on a scale of one to 10, we\nreceived an average rating of nine.\n\nBut, today, health and wellness goes beyond physical wellbeing. It also\ninvolves mental, financial, career, and social aspects.\n\nMohamad Roslan Bin Mohamad Nasir, Senior General Manager \u2013 Corporate, Denso\nMalaysia, reveals that his company, the supplier of advanced automotive\ntechnology, systems and components, is in the midst of planning for a full\nemployee wellness package.\n\n\u201cThe management is very supportive to embark on employee health and\nwellbeing,\u201d he said. Even though the firm is still at the benchmarking stage\nof the programme, Denso has various employee engagement initiatives that aid\nin staff wellness. For instance, a stress management programme for mental\nwellbeing and a consistent sports programme that helps with physical wellness.\n\nFor career and social wellness, the firm has a strong engagement programme\nthat looks at employee career movement within the company, and regionally, as\nwell as CSR programmes related to sustainable development. With many more\nelements of wellness to consider, in the following pages, we uncover how\norganisations are designing truly holistic wellbeing programmes through a\nseries of case studies.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-icon-\noffshore-is-achieving-employee-wellbeing-by-doing-more-with-less/): How Icon\nOffshore is doing more with less\n\nOn a scale of one to 10, employee wellbeing is a 10 for offshore support\nvessel provider, Icon Offshore. Despite being faced with financial constraints\ndue to a slowdown in the oil and gas industry, when it comes to health and\nwellness programmes, Kamarunnihar Abdul Samad, General Manager, Human\nResources, Icon Offshore, reveals a holistic view is taken.\n\nWhile Icon Offshore does not tick all five boxes of mental, physical,\nfinancial, career, and social, the initiatives it has introduced are very\ninterlinked, combining two or more aspects of wellness.\n\n> ##### With the slowdown in the oil and gas sector in recent years, with all\n> our staff activities, we are trying to do more with less.\n\nFor instance, to encourage financial wellbeing, a financial talk was held in\nJuly 2019 where staff were given practical financial advice and were able to\nask questions.\n\n\u201cBecause of the overall downturn in the global oil and gas sector, we are\nunable to pay very competitive salaries. So, we embarked on this talk to help\nour staff by giving them someone who can advise them on how best they can save\nfor the future.\u201d\n\nThe HR team is also working on a talk on how to prevent falling victim to\nfraud, which will be launched in Q3 2019.\n\nApart from improving financial wellbeing, the talks also help with mental\nwellbeing, she says, noting that \u201cif a person has issues with their finances,\nit\u2019s probably going to affect their mental health as well\u201d.\n\nThe initiative she is most proud of is the staff activities, which include\nindoor and outdoor games that not only get staff moving, but also provides an\nopportunity for them to socialise within the organisation.\n\n> ##### The outdoor games include badminton, futsal, and walk-a-hunt \u2013 a\n> treasure hunt that involves walking around town. While the indoor games\n> include charades, darts, and board games such as Scrabble.\n\n\u201cFor these games, the staff are divided into three groups. Each group has\nabout 20 to 25 people and includes a number of departments, a gender balance,\nand various levels. Even the big boss has to play. We encourage the younger\nstaff to be the leaders of the group so we can share leadership advice with\nthem informally,\u201d she says.\n\nThe first time the games were rolled out 2017, a town hall was held to explain\nto employees how the games would work. The second time, a general announcement\nwas made and the team leaders were contacted to disseminate the information.\n\nTo encourage participation, the game rules are that each person has to play at\nleast one game. Otherwise, points will be deducted from the team. At the end\nof the set of games, the winning team will get a monetary reward which they\ncan use to buy lunch or something else for each team member.\n\nWhile the returns on wellness are difficult to quantify, Kamarunnihar has a\npositive anecdote to share.\n\n> ##### The first time the games were introduced, two people actually changed\n> their mind about resigning, despite being offered a much higher salary at\n> the other organisation. When I asked why, they shared that the activities\n> had helped them feel like the company (here) is a family and that they might\n> not get the same experience there.\n\nThe number one thing HR should keep in mind when implementing such programmes?\n\u201cSafety is always number one.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-fostering-an-\nenvironment-that-prioritises-wellbeing-at-aberdeen-standard-investments/):\nFostering an environment that prioritises wellbeing at Aberdeen Standard\nInvestments\n\nAberdeen Standard Investments (Asia) is fully committed to providing employees\nwith a work environment that supports their overall wellbeing.\n\nTay Kheng-Guet, Head of Human Resources \u2013 Asia Pacific, Aberdeen Standard\nInvestments, says: \u201cWe have a corporate wellness strategy which is part of the\nAPAC HR strategy on diversity and inclusion. The strategy emphasises fostering\na work environment that prioritises employee wellbeing, valuing diversity, as\nwell as building inclusion and social engagement. Broadening the perspective\nof wellness, there is also a talent and career development strategy which\nguides the development of employees.\u201d\n\nThe APAC strategy has three prongs which include workplace support initiatives\nthat aim to protect employees\u2019 holistic wellbeing in the midst of changes and\nchallenges through three aspects:\n\n  * Agile working and flexible work arrangements which provide employees with flexible autonomy, allowing them to work smarter and more efficiently, which helps them to achieve a work-life balance.\n  * Work-life coaches (employee assistance programmes) which is a confidential service aimed at assisting employees on issues that are work-related, personal, legal, financial, as well as in transitions. Employees can have access to five work-life coaching sessions per year across 10 APAC locations. Coaches can support the diverse language requirements in all locations as well.\n  * Wellness initiatives that go beyond the usual health screenings.\n\nOn the wellness initiatives, Tay says:\n\n> ##### We have a comprehensive wellness calendar in place for the whole year\n> \u2013 covering monthly talks and activities in accordance with quarterly themes\n> of heart (emotional wellness), mind (personal effectiveness), body (physical\n> wellness) and spirit (mental wellness).\n\nApart from the monthly activities, on 31 July 2019, Aberdeen Standard\nInvestments held its inaugural ASI Health & Wellness Day where a whole day was\ndedicated to celebrating employees\u2019 wellbeing. Activities for the event\nincluded terrarium building, ergonomics awareness, aromatherapy sessions, and\nmass yoga conducted across three countries.\n\n\u201cThe event is a summer interns-led wellness project aimed at supporting our\nongoing effort to promote health and wellness. Our goal is to encourage all\nemployees to prioritise and take charge of their health amid their busy\nschedules and achieve a work-life balance.\u201d\n\nA variety of activities were planned to educate and cater to individuals\u2019\ninterests and needs \u2013 from an ergonomics talk addressing the importance of\nproper posture in alleviating common aches and pains resulting from prolonged\nsitting, to a yoga hour to help employees achieve mental wellness through\nmindful meditation.\n\n\u201cWe also had a terrarium-making workshop with MINDS to reduce stress and\nsharpen mental focus; as well as an aromatherapy session to help employees\nunderstand the tremendous benefits in helping one to relax and improve their\nmood,\u201d she adds.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-british-\namerican-tobacco-singapore-reduced-absenteeism-by-23/): How British American\nTobacco Singapore empowers staff to take charge of their wellbeing\n\nHaving been established for more than a century, British American Tobacco\n(BAT) is well-known for taking care of employee welfare. It constantly\nmeasures itself against the market and adapts practices to cater to employees\nthrough time and demographic-relevant solutions.\n\nMausami Arora, Head of HR, British American Tobacco Singapore, says: \u201cAt BAT\nSingapore, we are very diverse, with 24 nationalities, a multi-generational\nworkforce and functional breadth. Hence, it becomes imperative to have a\nholistic approach centred around our employees that has both buy-in and\nimpact.\u201d\n\n> ##### We take employee feedback very seriously and we continue to push the\n> envelope to make BAT Singapore a great place to work.\n\nThe organisation has a spectrum of programmes covering the five key aspects of\nwellness. This includes workshops to raise awareness on mental wellness and\nstress management, as well as those focused on savings and retirement\nplanning.\n\nApart from the mental and financial aspects, on the social front, BAT has an\nemployee-led and run sports and social committee which organises events such\nas Family Day, Durian Day, Sports Day, Dinner and Dance, and more. For the\ncareer aspect, the firm strongly believes in growth from within and invests\nheavily in employee development across all grades.\n\nFalling largely under the physical area of wellness, BAT launched an Active360\nhealth and wellness programme in January 2019. The programme seeks to appeal\nto different generations, empower them to take charge of their wellbeing\nthrough various preventive initiatives, and encourage a healthy lifestyle\namong employees.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind this new programme, Arora says: \u201cWhen we\nanalysed our inpatient and outpatient data, we realised the trend was\nreflective of national health concerns around hypertension, diabetes and\ncholesterol. We tend to spend 75% of our waking hours at work and there is a\nconstant blurring between work and life. Hence, at BAT Singapore, we wanted to\ncreate a preventive culture of health and wellness.\u201d\n\nAfter obtaining buy-in from top management and senior stakeholders, the health\nand wellness programme was rolled out with a wellness party to coincide with\nthe launch of the National Corporate Steps Challenge, Season 4.\n\n> ##### An activity plan for the entire year was mapped out, with weekly\n> recurring activities that are relatable, meaningful, impactful, and\n> amplifying.\n\n\u201cActivities include Yoghurt Mondays, Fruity Tuesdays, Salad Wednesdays and De-\nStress Thursdays which are intended to continuously engage the employees and\nraise awareness on healthy eating and mental wellbeing.\u201d In the middle of the\nyear, BAT followed up with a super healthy buffet day where employees were\nable to sample healthy and delicious dishes during lunch.\n\n\u201cA role model was also appointed to share how she achieved her desired weight\nand BMI by persevering with healthy eating habits. Overall, the event was very\nwell-received, and we got lots of positive feedback from the employees.\u201d\n\nTo measure programme success, BAT monitors the emerging trends across medical\nbills, absenteeism, health & safety, employee engagement scores, and employee\nuptake ratios.\n\n> ##### We are already seeing some early success, with absenteeism dropping by\n> 23% to date in 2019 versus the same period last year.\n\nRather than focusing on fixed targets which may end up killing the programme\nin its infancy, BAT looks to create a culture where employees are empowered to\nmake conscious choices towards their health goals, she concludes.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-taiyo-\nnippon-sanso-holdings-singapore-reduces-work-related-stress/): How Taiyo\nNippon Sanso Holdings Singapore reduces work-related stress\n\nWhile employee health and wellbeing is typically considered HR\u2019s\nresponsibility, the responsibility is shared between HR and the business at\nindustrial gas manufacturer, Taiyo Nippon Sanso Holdings Singapore.\n\nWith health and wellbeing being an underlying foundation for an effective\ntalent management strategy at the firm, Pauline Loo, Vice President, Human\nResource & Admin, Taiyo Nippon Sanso Holdings Singapore, says: \u201cIt is a shared\nresponsibility between HR professionals and business leaders to actively\nengage employees in a holistic manner, going beyond physical wellbeing.\u201d\n\nThe organisation has a plethora of initiatives covering the five aspects of\nwellness. In the area of physical wellness, it has the health and wellness\nclub (H&W) which started in April 2018. Comprising employee representatives\nfrom various divisions, including engineering and HR, the club rolls out\nmonthly health and wellness activities ranging from badminton sessions to\nbowling sessions, and even ice-skating sessions.\n\n> ##### \u201cThis year, starting from July and ending in September, for a period\n> of three months, the H&W club organised sports tournaments for our\n> employees,\u201d Loo adds.\n\nIn the area of financial wellness, as part of its HR Cares \u2013 Keep Our People\nInteractive quarterly seminar, speakers are invited to speak with employees on\nvarious wealth education series, ranging from will-writing to lasting power\nattorney.\n\nOn the social front, the company leverages on its Unity in Diversity campaign\nwhich started on 8 August 2018. The firm identified its first Unity in\nDiversity ambassador to promote D&I in social activities within the company\nand among the group\u2019s subsidiaries.\n\n\u201cA Unity in Diversity video was produced in June 2019 to showcase the spirit\nof embracing unity despite differences between the Japan head office and the\nSingapore regional headquarters. We are also working on a Unity in Diversity\nvideo for the Southeast Asia region.\u201d\n\nIn the area of career wellness, it has implemented two competency models \u2013 the\nManaging Self and Leading Others model and a Human Resource competency model.\nThe two models were designed and developed from April 2019 to ensure\nconsistent talent management practices across Southeast Asia, and India. \u201cThis\nhelps integrate talent practices, for example, ensuring that rewards are tied\nto performance, and performance is tied to development.\u201d\n\n> ##### To ensure mental wellness, one of the 10 core general competencies in\n> the Managing Self and Leading Others competency model is around time and\n> stress management.\n\n\u201cIncorporating \u2018time and stress management\u2019 as one of the ten core general\ncompetencies helps create awareness among the employees that effective time\nmanagement enables them to deliver their work assignments in an efficient\nmanner and reduce unnecessary work-related stress. \u201cIn this way, the employees\nmanage themselves better in terms of striking a better work-life balance and\noverall mental wellbeing.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Loo shares that time and stress management was the first core general\ncompetency shared with employees in the inaugural run of HR Cares Brown Bag\nseminars.\n\nAsked about measuring the ROI on wellness, Loo reveals she plans to measure it\nthrough employee engagement analytics.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-fave-\nkeeps-employee-health-wellness-in-check/): A range of wellness activities at\nFave\n\nWhile online-to-offline commerce platform Fave does not have special\ninitiatives parked under each aspect of wellness, the organisation organises a\nrange of activities, says Anisha Sasheendran, Regional Head of People, Fave.\n\nTo promote physical wellness, the firm organises post-work exercise classes\nthroughout the week.\n\n> ##### \u201cWe have Yoga Mondays, Futsal Tuesdays, Badminton Wednesdays, and\n> Zumba Thursdays. We also have free health checks and talks from time to\n> time,\u201d she says.\n\nOn the financial front, with the average age of Fave\u2019s employees being 27,\nmany are interested in wealth and financial management, she observes. In line\nwith that, the organisation hosts talks and workshops with external partners\nfrom time to time.\n\nIn an effort to support employees\u2019 mental wellness, while Fave does not have\nexperts within the company, it provides contacts to organisations/ experts\nthat are trained to help individuals who need assistance.\n\n\u201cWe have also given time off to some employees that were pre-\ndiagnosed/diagnosed with some sort of mental condition. This really helped\nthem rejuvenate. Some are back now and doing great stuff within the\norganisation.\u201d\n\n> ##### On the career front, Fave has mentorship programmes, internal job\n> rotation opportunities, and one-to-one career chats for employees who are\n> keen to know more about their career growth.\n\nTo provide opportunities for employees to socialise, Fave has various social\nevents in and out of the office which employees are occasionally able to bring\ntheir family and friends to attend.\n\nApart from that, she says: \u201cWe host external events at the office and\nencourage our employees to attend networking and external sessions outside the\noffice as well. We also established a learning fund which employees can use to\nlearn something new \u2013 from attending conferences abroad to even taking a\nKorean class.\u201d\n\nThe initiatives are communicated to staff via Fave\u2019s monthly/quarterly all-\nhands sessions as well as via email, and effectiveness is gauged through pulse\nsurvey scores.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-urbanfoxs-\nbroad-spectrum-of-health-and-wellness-initiatives/): UrbanFox\u2019s broad spectrum\nof health and wellness initiatives\n\nEmployee wellbeing is of utmost importance to UrbanFox, a B2B2C logistics\nenabler that is a subsidiary of Keppel Logistics.\n\n**Abeline Kok, HR Team Lead at UrbanFox** , shares that the organisation\nundertakes a broad spectrum of health and wellness initiatives to support the\nphysical, mental, financial, career, and social wellbeing of its employees.\n\nOn the physical aspect, she says: \u201cWe have mobile massages for our employees\nat least once a month. Employees register for the massages; each session lasts\nabout 20 minutes.\u201d\n\n> ##### The massages are also part of UrbanFox\u2019s CSR efforts as the firm\n> engages the mobile massage team from the Singapore Association of the\n> Visually Handicapped.\n\nOther initiatives for physical wellness include high intensity interval\ntraining workshops once to twice a month, and complimentary health screenings\nfor employees.\n\nOn the mental aspect, UrbanFox organises lunchtime talks on mental wellness,\nas well holds staff engagement sessions.\n\n\u201cThe engagement sessions support mental wellbeing by providing employees with\na platform for them to share their feelings and provide feedback.\u201d\n\nIn addition, lunchtime talks are also held to promote financial wellness.\nTopics for the talks include personal financial planning as well as sharing on\nCPF and MediSave policies and schemes.\n\nTo ensure career wellness, UrbanFox has career discussions with high potential\nemployees. \u201cDuring these sessions, we will discuss their career goals,\u201d Kok\nsays. She adds that mentors are also assigned to high potentials.\n\nElaborating on other employee development and growth initiatives, she notes:\n\n> ##### We work with Workforce Singapore to conduct skills profiling workshops\n> for our employees. We also have quarterly appraisals where supervisors speak\n> to teams about their performance and careers.\n\nOn the social front, UrbanFox has a plethora of initiatives to encourage staff\nbonding. The firm organises family day events, festive celebrations, as well\nas team building sessions every year.\n\n\u201cWe also have activities which are staff-initiated. Employees with similar\ninterests will create a chat group on Google Hangouts and organise get-\ntogether sessions. We have chat groups for bowling, rock climbing, board\ngaming, KTV, and more,\u201d she says.\n\nThe initiative under the social umbrella which she is most proud of, is the\nFoxlympics, a sports and games event that runs across the entire year. The\ninitiative started in 2018 and is now in its second run.\n\nIt comprises competitions in foosball, table tennis, darts, Jenga, and\nScrabble. Staff are grouped into divisions which compete against each other.\nEach division will consist of a few departments to facilitate inter-department\ninteractions. At the end of the year, a trophy will be given to the division\nwith the most points.\n\n> ##### Senior management is supportive because it sees that sports and games\n> contribute to the physical and mental wellness of the employees.\n\nIn addition, bonds between colleagues have strengthened over the friendly\ncompetitions.\n\n\u201cThe turnout for the event has been good and there has been positive feedback\nthrough various channels, including employee surveys and monthly round tables\nwith the Managing Director. We also encourage staff to share feedback on\nGlassdoor. Since it is anonymous, the feedback should be pretty honest,\u201d she\nsays.\n\n* * *\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/10115352/HRSG-Sep-Oct-2019-Health-Wellness-feature-\ninfographic.jpg)\n\n_This feature was published in[Human Resources\u2019 September-October 2019\nedition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of the Singapore\nmagazine._\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/03161518/hrsg_sep-oct19.jpg)\n\n_Photos / provided  \nImage/ [iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/)_\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

[Nate\nDvorak](//www.gallup.com/people/item.aspx?a=167717)\n\n![Rethinking Competencies, Part 1: 7 Expectations for\nLeaders](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/pscquacgyuckin9mmwcf1q.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * A broken competency model makes everyone's job harder than it needs to be\n  * HR needs to reevaluate the behaviors that actually contribute to success\n  * Start by aligning job descriptions with strengths and development\n\n_This article is the first in a series about rethinking competency behaviors,\nfeedback and programs._\n\nThe simplest way to be clear about behavioral expectations for leaders is to\ncommunicate which behaviors achieve the results your business wants -- not\nwith a list of competencies that may or may not link to outcomes. Companies\nthat don't examine the behaviors that lead to the desired outcomes are liable\nto confuse leaders about what is expected of them.\n\nThat's not at all unusual. Though knowing what is expected of them at work is\nan employee's most fundamental need, [Gallup's 2017 _State of the American\nWorkplace_ report](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-\nworkplace-report-2017.aspx) found that only six in 10 employees know what\nthose expectations are. What's more, just 41% strongly agree that their job\ndescription aligns well with the work they are asked to do.\n\nThe lack of clear expectations and accurate job descriptions creates an ever-\npresent fear of being exposed as incompetent and being punished for it.\n\nAnd managers may be worse off than the teams they lead. According to Gallup's\nfirst perspective paper in a series on this topic, [_The Manager Experience:\nTop Challenges & Perks of\nManagers_](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/259820/manager-experience-\nchallenges-perk-perspective-paper.aspx), managers are:\n\n>   * 15 percentage points more likely to say they have multiple competing\n> priorities\n>   * four points less likely to say their job description is clear or that it\n> aligns to the work they do\n>   * six points more likely to feel stress during a lot of the workday\n>   * 11% less likely to strongly agree they get to do what they do best every\n> day.\n>\n\nThe lack of clear expectations and accurate job descriptions creates an ever-\npresent fear of being exposed as incompetent and then being punished for it.\nLeaders have a real incentive to meekly accept lists of competency\nrequirements, even if the requirements don't align with their role.\n\nConsequently, HR's performance reviews can't be entirely realistic or\ncomprehensive. When HR must rely on an ambiguous, inconsistent, contradictory\narray of traits, skills, capabilities, knowledge, behaviors, and\nresponsibilities -- and trust, this describes far too many competency models\n-- the job is far more difficult than it has to be.\n\nWhat HR needs, what _all_ leaders and managers need, is a fresh look at the\nbehaviors that actually contribute to performance, development and success.\n\n### **Competencies 2.0: The 7 Expectations for Leadership Behavior**\n\nRecently, Gallup researchers conducted a study involving more than 550 job\nroles and 360 unique job competencies. It showed that leaders achieve success,\ndespite varied roles, organizations, and industries, by focusing on the\nbehaviors within these seven expectations:\n\n**1\\. Build relationships.** Establish connections with others to build trust,\nshare ideas and accomplish work.\n\n**2\\. Develop people.** Help others become more effective through strengths\ndevelopment, clear expectations, encouragement and coaching.\n\n**3\\. Lead change.** Recognize that change is essential, set goals for change\nand lead purposeful efforts to adapt work that aligns with the stated vision.\n\n**4\\. Inspire others.** Encourage others through positivity, vision,\nconfidence, challenge and recognition.\n\n**5\\. Think critically.** Seek information, critically evaluate the\ninformation, apply the knowledge gained and solve problems.\n\n**6\\. Communicate clearly.** Listen, share information concisely and with\npurpose, and be open to hearing opinions.\n\n**7\\. Create accountability.** Identify the consequences of actions and hold\nyourself and others responsible for performance.\n\nChanging the expectation from a focus on competency to behavior instead allows\norganizations and their leaders to focus on the critical expectations of the\njob, not the things no one can control (e.g., idiosyncrasies), overly specific\nrequirements (e.g., specific knowledge), and unrealistic aspirations (e.g.,\nirrelevant skills).\n\nWhat HR needs, what all leaders and managers need, is a fresh look at the\nbehaviors that actually contribute to performance, development and success.\n\nAnyone can gear their actions toward an expectation, though everyone does so\nin their own way. A leader's \"own way\" can be identified and measured with the\nCliftonStrengths assessment. [People who know and use their\nCliftonStrengths](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/home.aspx) are:\n\n>   * 6x as likely to be engaged at work\n>   * 7.8% more productive in their role\n>   * 3x as likely to have an excellent quality of life\n>   * 6x as likely to do what they do best every day\n>\n\nThe CliftonStrengths assessment provides a common language with which to\napproach human development that necessitates individualization, allowing\nleaders to bring their own strengths to bear for each of these behaviors.\nThere is no more effective way to empower leaders than to see each person in\nterms of their strengths.\n\nAnd, ultimately, successful performance _is_ the expectation for leaders.\nPerformance is the criteria HR should be evaluating and coaching toward.\n\nLeaders ought to ask, without fear of consequences, if their role expectations\nare in their job description, if their behaviors help them meet those\nexpectations, and if the development they get is the help they need to achieve\nthe desired outcomes.\n\nThough leaders are often judged on their ability to conform to a competency\nlist, companies are judged for their success. Achieving success can't happen\nthrough muddled, ineffective leadership behavior. A good faith examination of\nbehaviors may take some energy and nerve, but it encourages leaders to do what\nthey do best -- and their companies, too -- that's the competency that matters\nmost.\n\n### **Rethink the route to success:**\n\n  * Want to learn more about competencies?

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Entrepreneurs](/entrepreneurs)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nSubbu Viswanathan\n\nCEO of [Disprz](https://www.disprz.com/), an enterprise skills acceleration\nplatform. 3-time tech entrepreneur. Ex-McKinsey, IIT, ISB\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nIn my time at McKinsey, one of the associate partners once said, \u201cOur client\nmay have the knowledge, but we have the skill  \u2014 specifically, the problem-\nsolving skill  \u2014 to overcome the knowledge barrier.\u201d These words represent the\nbedrock of management consulting: Teams with no prior knowledge of fields as\ndeep as oil and gas exploration can counsel clients who have spent decades in\nthese industries.\n\nJust three months after learning about oil and gas offshore exploration, we\ntold a boardroom full of veterans in that industry what their five-year\nstrategy should be. This shows that knowledge and skills are not the same. The\nclient had the knowledge of the dynamics of the oil and gas industry. We as a\nconsulting company had the skills around business strategy, problem solving\nand analytical reasoning.\n\nKnowledge, skills and behaviors, together called competencies, define each\nrole in the corporate world, from the CEO to the production worker.\n\nIf you are a startup founder, after defining your functions and roles (read my\nprevious post on this\n[here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2019/07/10/why-thinking-long-term-\nabout-functions-and-roles-is-critical-as-you-scale-your-\nstartup/#2825c4c74169)), it\u2019s important to define your competency map. This\nwill form the basis of your people strategy.\n\n**So, what is a competency?**\n\n[According to the University of Nebraska-\nLincoln](https://hr.unl.edu/compensation/nuvalues/corecompetencies.shtml/),\ncompetency is defined as \u201cthe combination of observable and measurable\nknowledge, skills, abilities and personal attributes that contribute to\nenhanced employee performance and ultimately result in organizational\nsuccess.\u201d\n\nAt my current company, a skills acceleration platform for enterprises, we\nbelieve a well-defined competency map is the foundation of success. This\nactivity requires the active attention of founders, and it could mean the\ndifference between a unicorn and a failed startup.\n\nUnfortunately, I\u2019ve found that many companies fail to fully leverage\ncompetency mapping. Some companies don\u2019t do it at all, despite growing to\nhundreds of employees.\n\nHR functions of large corporations usually leverage competency mapping, but\nthey often face fatal flaws  \u2014 being dated or too leadership-skills focused.\nIn today\u2019s AI era in which new roles and competencies are constantly being\ncreated, it\u2019s important for competency mapping to be kept up to date.\n\nStill other companies conduct competency mapping implicitly, but putting it on\npaper and making it the immediate assignment of their HR function would reap\nthem a host of benefits.\n\n**How should you think about competencies?**\n\nThere are different ways to think about competencies, but at my enterprise-\nskilling company, we think about it in four dimensions (most documented\nliterature on the subject will mirror this thinking):\n\n1\\. Knowledge areas: These are specific to your industry (for example, oil and\ngas exploration, rubber manufacturing or SaaS), your company (your company\nhistory and values) and regulations in your industry (for example, HIPPA).\nThese knowledge areas should be common to everybody in the company, from the\nproduction worker to the CEO.\n\n2\\. Functional skills: These are the hard skills required for each role. They\nare role-dependent. For a digital marketing manager, functional skills would\nbe LinkedIn marketing, Facebook marketing and Google Analytics. For a data\nscientist, these might be data visualization, data modelling and Python. Note\nthat digital skills are a part of functional skills, but some list them as a\nseparate competency category. It doesn't matter where you want to place them,\nas long as you think about them.\n\n3\\. Leadership skills: These are the soft skills required for different levels\nof leadership, irrespective of function. A widely accepted industry norm here\nis to think about it in three levels: leading self, leading teams and leading\nbusinesses.\n\nIndividual contributors need skills around leading self, which include time\nmanagement, work-life balance, emotional intelligence and analytical thinking.\nManagers need skills around leading teams, including conflict resolution,\ncoaching and mentoring, and collaborative team leadership. Finally, business\nheads need skills around entrepreneurship and business strategy.\n\nHR departments are good at defining these skills; this is where a lot of the\nvalues of a company are reflected. For instance, building sustainable\nbusinesses could be a leadership skill for a company that promises to make\nproducts that are environmentally friendly. Customer orientation could be a\nleadership skill for a company that has a strong customer-first philosophy.\n\n4\\. Behaviors: This is where it gets interesting. The first three categories\nare measurable in some way, while behaviors are observable. Examples include\nownership, trust, sensitivity and approachability.\n\n**What do you do with competency mapping?**\n\nIn an ideal company, every employee clearly knows their list of competencies\nacross the four categories (it will come to between 10-15 competencies total)\nand strives to improve every day. Companies that attract and retain the best\npeople use this common shared understanding of competencies to drive all their\npeople decisions in recruitment, training and career advancement.\n\n1\\. Recruitment: When you recruit, assess candidates along these competencies.\nDefining your company\u2019s competencies gives you an objective scale to decide\nwho to hire and who not to hire. Communicate the expected performance on each\ncompetency. We lay out the competencies in the offer letter itself.\n\n2\\. Training: Structure learning pathways around your defined competencies.\nOur goal is to help companies create personalized learning journeys for\nemployees by combining digital learning and social learning interventions.\n\n3\\. Appraisals: Assess individual employees\u2019 proficiency levels on each\ncompetency through manager evaluations, assessments and 360-degree feedback.\nCommunicate the results to each employee.\n\n4\\. Promotions/career advancement: The resulting proficiency levels on each\ncompetency should drive promotion decisions. For example, a software engineer\nshould know the proficiency levels they need to hit in each competency in\norder to get to the next role of senior software engineer. Make it\ntransparent.\n\nThere are many management books out there on how to build great companies that\nfocus on strategy, team building and culture. The science of competency\nmapping is often overlooked, but it is just as important.\n\n[![YEC](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/assets/images/avatars/blog-1789_400_48b435d08b4faa6b9d7a43bb49d8f561.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/\n\"Photo of YEC\")\n\n[YEC](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/)\n\n[Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC)](http://yec.co) is an invitation-only, fee-\nbased organization comprised of the world's most successful entrepreneurs 45\nand younger.

When people exaggerate their experiences it can be\nquite evident as the lack of experience is reflected in the words that they're\nusing.'\n\nEnsure to also address the recruiter at the start then talk about your core\nattributes.\n\nKaren explained that when she sees that someone is addressing her directly,\nshe can see that they are investing time into the opportunity.\n\n'Think about what the first impression that's created would be when the\nrecruiter reads your resume'.\n\nShe also recommends utilising blank space by using titles and fewer words for\na greater impact.\n\n### The best things to include in your resume\n\nList all forms of education \u2013 high school, tertiary study, online courses,\ndiplomas, certificates, apprenticeships\n\nDisplay relevant training, the institution and completion year for each course\ncompleted\n\nInclude all past job titles, duties involved and expertise\n\nAlter your resume for every job and relate your responsibilities and\nexperiences to the position advertised\n\nShare your significant achievements well\n\nWrite a succinct summary explaining career objectives and value to the\norganisation\n\nClearly highlight core skills by using bullet points\n\nList the most recent and relevant position first to showcase skills and\nknowledge\n\nList your interests and hobbies\n\nProvide a good summary to showcase

a\npotential employer to read through your resume\n\nSpeaking to Seek, Pete Noblet from Hays said one of the best things you can do\nis highlight both your job title and your achievements.\n\n'[So you might say] as a social media consultant for Company A, I manage many\ndigital media channels to help drive engagement and brand awareness with\nconsumers,' he told the job site.\n\nIf you are trying to stand out in front of other candidates on LinkedIn, you\nwill need to provide full descriptions of what you have done and the skills\nthat can be used immediately in a new role\n\nYou should then highlight something you have individually done - whether\nthat's tripling the audience on Facebook or doubling the amount of followers\non Facebook.\n\nPete said this is a good approach because it outlines your background and gets\nstraight to the point.\n\nA similar tactic should also be used on LinkedIn in order to separate yourself\nfrom others applying for the same job.\n\n'A lot of people assume that once they have filled out the basics on their\nLinkedIn profile, that is all that they need to do,' Sue said.\n\n'If you are trying to stand out in front of other candidates, you will need

groups of people from gathering\nin one place at any given time, online platforms including LinkedIn are a\ngreat way to develop connections and network with other people.\n\n'Now is a good time to track down past colleagues and managers and request an\nonline recommendation via LinkedIn,' Sue said.\n\n'And don't be afraid to contact members of a professional association related\nto where you would like to work and see if you can volunteer in some way'.\n\nShe also said to 'be realistic' about how much time is spent each day on\ncareer development tasks, as adjusting to the new home isolation 'rhythm' will\ntake time.\n\n'I usually suggest two hours a day, five days a week is more than enough to\nkeep you in the running for great opportunities,' she said.\n\nRead more:\n\n  *

health & wellness initiatives at Taiyo\nNippon Sanso Holdings Singapore, __Pauline Loo, the firm 's __Vice President,\nHuman Resource & Admin, reveals how work-related stress is reduced by\nincluding time and stress management as a core __general competency._\n\nWhile employee health and wellbeing is typically considered HR\u2019s\nresponsibility, the responsibility is shared between HR and the business at\nindustrial gas manufacturer, Taiyo Nippon Sanso Holdings Singapore.\n\nWith health and wellbeing being an underlying foundation for an effective\ntalent management strategy at the firm, Pauline Loo, Vice President, Human\nResource & Admin, Taiyo Nippon Sanso Holdings Singapore, says: \u201cIt is a shared\nresponsibility between HR professionals and business leaders to actively\nengage employees in a holistic manner, going beyond physical wellbeing.\u201d\n\nThe organisation has a plethora of initiatives covering the five aspects of\nwellness. In the area of physical wellness, it has the health and wellness\nclub (H&W) which started in April 2018. Comprising employee representatives\nfrom various divisions, including engineering and HR, the club rolls out\nmonthly health and wellness activities ranging from badminton sessions to\nbowling sessions, and even ice-skating sessions.\n\n> ##### \u201cThis year, starting from July and ending in September, for a period\n> of three months, the H&W club organised sports tournaments for our\n> employees,\u201d Loo adds.\n\nIn the area of financial wellness, as part of its HR Cares \u2013 Keep Our People\nInteractive quarterly seminar, speakers are invited to speak with employees on\nvarious wealth education series, ranging from will-writing to lasting power\nattorney.\n\nOn the social front, the company leverages on its Unity in Diversity campaign\nwhich started on 8 August 2018. The firm identified its first Unity in\nDiversity ambassador to promote D&I in social activities within the company\nand among the group\u2019s subsidiaries.\n\n\u201cA Unity in Diversity video was produced in June 2019 to showcase the spirit\nof embracing unity despite differences between the Japan head office and the\nSingapore regional headquarters. We are also working on a Unity in Diversity\nvideo for the Southeast Asia region.\u201d\n\nIn the area of career wellness, it has implemented two competency models \u2013 the\nManaging Self and Leading Others model and a Human Resource competency model.\nThe two models were designed and developed from April 2019 to ensure\nconsistent talent management practices across Southeast Asia, and India. \u201cThis\nhelps integrate talent practices, for example, ensuring that rewards are tied\nto performance, and performance is tied to development.\u201d\n\n> ##### To ensure mental wellness, one of the 10 core general competencies in\n> the Managing Self and Leading Others competency model is around time and\n> stress management.\n\n\"Incorporating \u2018time and stress management\u2019 as one of the ten core general\ncompetencies helps create awareness among the employees that effective time\nmanagement enables them to deliver their work assignments in an efficient\nmanner and reduce unnecessary work-related stress. \"In this way, the employees\nmanage themselves better in terms of striking a better work-life balance and\noverall mental wellbeing.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Loo shares that time and stress management was the first core general\ncompetency shared with employees in the inaugural run of HR Cares Brown Bag\nseminars.\n\nAsked about measuring the ROI on wellness, Loo reveals she plans to measure it\nthrough employee engagement analytics.\n\n* * *\n\n_This case study was published in[Human Resources\u2019 September-October

This seismic shift has increased workplace\nvolatility and complexity.\n\nDigital transformation is about technology, but it is also largely about\npeople and how they adapt, work with, and augment technology to support\norganizational goals. The HR function is in a unique position to help\norganizations not only navigate this turbulence but also to help position any\norganization\u2019s most valuable asset, people, to succeed in a digital world. At\nMcLean & Company, an HR research & advisory firm, we partner with HR leaders\nto provide practical solutions to their complex HR problems. Digital\ntransformation has been an increasingly popular topic with our members. So\nwhen we put together our annual survey of HR professionals, as well as\nprofessionals outside of HR, to get their take on the talent landscape, we\nincluded HR and digital disruption as a key theme. What we found was\nfascinating.\n\n### **A focus on employee development and change management leads to the\nbroadest positive organizational outcomes**\n\n  \nWhile there has been a lot of buzz in HR circles about digital disruption, a\nfull 30% of respondents indicated their HR teams were not yet taking action to\nsupport digital transformation in their organizations. HR functions that fail\nto act, risk negative outcomes in innovation, productivity, and overall\norganizational performance.\n\nOn the flip side, organizations that focus on change management, equipping\nleaders to lead in agile environments, and updating and developing employees\non new core competencies and specific new skills had positive results across\nthe most key outcomes:\n\n![McLean & Company, 2020 HR Trends Survey](/images/ajax-loader.png)  \n**Source: McLean & Company, 2020 HR Trends Survey, n=419**\n\nIf enhancing or developing new skills and competencies are critical to get the\nmost out of digital transformation, how should HR tackle this and what\ncompetencies should they focus on?\n\n### **Workforce proficiency in digital transformation competencies is bleak**\n\n  \nIn our research and conversations with members, we found that six key\ncompetencies came up over and over. So we set out to assess how proficient\norganizations are in these competencies \u2013 and the results were disheartening:\nonly digital literacy and resilience scored more than 6/10 in average\nproficiency\u2026and fewer than 30% of organizations had high proficiency in either\ncompetency. What\u2019s more, the results showed smaller organizations had much\nhigher proficiency across all the digital transformation competencies than did\ntheir larger counterparts, suggesting there may be an innate nimbleness in\nsmaller organizations which allows them to transition more quickly. Regardless\nof organizational size, there is definitely an opportunity for HR to focus on\nhelping their workforce increase their digital transformation competence.\n\n![McLean & Company, 2020 HR Trends Survey](/images/ajax-loader.png)  \n**Source: McLean & Company, 2020 HR Trends Survey, n=429**\n\n###\n\n### **Continuous learning is key\u2026and doesn\u2019t have to cost a ton**\n\n  \nIt is clear that learning & development will play a huge role in digital\ntransformation success. Our survey showed that organizations with highly\neffective learning & development functions also have increased innovation; a\ngreater employee experience; and an increased ability to support change\n(McLean & Company, 2020 HR Trends Survey, n=838).\n\nDespite these benefits, while enabling learning & development is in the top\nthree of talent-related priorities for that outside of HR, only 41% of HR\ndepartments are highly effective in this area. (McLean & Company, 2020 HR\nTrends Survey, n=365 / n = 827).\n\nThe good news is that throwing money at learning & development isn\u2019t required\nto make learning effective. Those who take the following actions to promote a\nculture of continuous learning are outperforming on the following key outcomes\nrelated to digital transformation: ability to quickly change; enabling\ninnovation; workforce productivity; and supporting change (McLean & Company,\n2020 HR Trends Survey, n=456). And none of these actions are directly related\nto spending large amounts of money!\n\n  \n  \n![McLean & Company, 2020 HR Trends Survey](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Source: McLean & Company, 2020 HR Trends Survey, n=456**\n\nIf organizations look at digital transformation as a technology-driven\nexercise, they will fail to capture the benefits that they\u2019re seeking. The\nimpact of the workforce, not only in providing the deep technology skills\nrequired but in learning to work with new technology and adapting to the\nchanges and is pivotal to success.\n\nWhat the 2020 HR Trends Report ultimately shows us is empowering employees\nthrough a combination of Learning & Development, and effective Talent\nManagement can not only help with the adoption of digital transformation\nefforts but will also help with sustaining and expanding those efforts in\nyears to come. After all, technologies will continue to evolve and change but\nan engaged and talented workforce powered by digital transformation will\nremain as the real competitive differentiator.\n\nAs the department that acquires and equips talent to achieve the\norganization\u2019s goals, HR has a huge role to play in enabling digital\ntransformation.\n\nLearn More:\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fwhat-hr-needs-to-do-more-for-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=What+HR+Needs+to+Do+More+for+Digital+Transformation\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What+HR+Needs+to+Do+More+for+Digital+Transformation&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fwhat-hr-needs-to-do-more-for-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fwhat-hr-needs-to-do-more-for-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fwhat-hr-needs-to-do-more-for-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=What HR Needs to Do More for Digital\nTransformation&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2Fwhat-hr-needs-to-do-more-for-digital-\ntransformation%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Digital Transformation ](/category/digital-\ntransformation/ \"Digital Transformation\")\n\n  * [ ![Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/shutterstock_1134410339_5db306fad1860.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-special-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-\nspecial-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe future of work is uncertain, and the fear of AI taking over work is real.\nBut there\u2019s more to it, as expressed by some HR leaders we spoke to.\n\nby [Puja Lalwani](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/puja-\nlalwani-1/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Oct 25, 2019\n\n  * [ ![How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process \\(and How It Won\u2019t\\)](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/ai_in_recruitment_5da994c5c9d8b.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-and-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-wont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process (and How It Won\u2019t)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-\nand-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-\nwont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nWe hear a lot about AI\u2019s effect on jobs, but what about its effect on\nrecruiters?

The workplace I described in my book, [_The 2020\nWorkplace: How Innovative Companies Attract, Develop, and Keep Tomorrow's\nEmployees Today_](https://www.amazon.com/2020-Workplace-Innovative-Companies-\nTomorrows/dp/0061763276 \"https://www.amazon.com/2020-Workplace-Innovative-\nCompanies-Tomorrows/dp/0061763276\"), is now distinguished by a workplace where\nthe rapid pace of change is the new constant in the world of work!\n\nAs we head into the 2020 workplace, ask yourself: how can you lead your HR\nfunction in the next decade?\n\n![Humans + Bots](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e1f37d7a854780006e8966f/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nHumans + Bots\n\nShutterstock / Panuwat Phimpha\n\nHere is my countdown of what you need to include on your HR agenda for the\n2020 workplace:\n\n### **#1)** Start With Focusing On Worker Wellbeing\n\nMany companies concerned about the future of work focus on the massive\ndisruption of jobs, automation, and workforce demographics. All of this is\nimportant but as HR leaders we need to start with making worker wellbeing a\npriority in 2020!\n\nMichael Fenlon, Chief People Officer of [PwC](https://www.pwc.com/\n\"https://www.pwc.com/\"), shares why this is growing in importance, \"As HR\nleaders worker wellbeing is impacted by several macro trends such as the\ngrowth of the digital economy and the increased need to develop resilience\nwhile we are being bombarded by constant social media notifications. We\ndecided as a firm it was time to study this and take action.\" PwC conducted a\ncomprehensive study among their global workforce with University of Southern\nCalifornia (USC) to explore this in depth.\n\nToday In: [Leadership Strategy](https://www.forbes.com/leadership-strategy)\n\n  * [\n\n### Judges Slap Down USCIS Again On H-1B Visas\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2020/04/08/judges-slap-down-\nuscis-again-on-h-1b-visas/)\n\n  * [\n\n### We Are In The Grips Of A Global Pandemic. What Should Business Leaders Be\nDoing Next?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hankprybylski/2020/04/07/we-are-in-the-grips-\nof-a-global-pandemic-what-should-business-leaders-be-doing-next/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Markets End Their Panic But Remain Highly Tentative\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2020/04/07/markets-end-their-\npanic-but-remain-highly-tentative/)\n\nFirst, PwC defined worker wellbeing in a holistic way, including physical,\nmental, emotional, and spiritual lenses. Then PwC team set out to identify\nspecific practices that can improve wellbeing. This makes wellbeing tangible\nrather than an abstract concept. These habits are identified in the [PwC Habit\nBank](https://habitbank.pwc.com/#tab=1 \"https://habitbank.pwc.com/#tab=1\") and\nrange from reminding employees to stand up for short meetings, wind down prior\nto sleep, make time to be outside with nature, turn off smartphone\nnotifications, and decide what \"not\" to do as well as what to \"focus\" on!\n\nPwC created a technology platform that integrates all of this called [Be Well,\nWork Well](https://habitbank.pwc.com/#tab=1\n\"https://habitbank.pwc.com/#tab=1\") and it is a one-stop-shop for all things\nwellbeing.\n\nBut just providing the information on wellbeing isn't enough. According to\nFenlon, \"The real power lies in creating a wellbeing culture, making a\ncommitment to wellbeing at the individual, team, and organizational levels and\nequipping employees with technology that promotes wellbeing behaviors.\" This\nis just the advice we need as we craft our HR agenda for the 2020 workplace!\n\n### **#2) Prepare for Humans + Bots as The New Blended Workforce**\n\nWhen we think of the blended workforce we often think of full-time workers\nworking side by side with contract and gig workers. In 2020 when we refer to\nthe \"blended workforce,\" we mean humans and bots working together.\n\nResearch among 8,370 global HR leaders, hiring managers and employees\nconducted by [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html\n\"https://www.oracle.com/index.html\") and [Future\nWorkplace](https://futureworkplace.com/ \"https://futureworkplace.com/\") found\nthat half (50%) of workers already use some form of A.I. at work, up from 32%\nin 2018. As Gartner predicts, by 2021 [25% of workers will use a virtual\nemployee assistant (VEA)](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-\nreleases/2019-01-09-gartner-predicts-25-percent-of-digital-workers-will-u\n\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-01-09-gartner-\npredicts-25-percent-of-digital-workers-will-u\") daily, an increase from less\nthan 2% in 2019. This includes Amazon Alexa for Business and an array of\nconversational bots used for all types of HR processes.\n\nKnowing how to orient, develop, engage, and work side by side with a bot will\nbe the newest skill set for 2020, as human and bot teams will work together\nand, in many cases, outperform either humans or bots working on their own! How\nyou orient, develop and engage your blended workforce in 2020 will be your\ncompetitive advantage.\n\n[DBS Bank](https://www.dbs.com.sg/index/default.page\n\"https://www.dbs.com.sg/index/default.page\"), the largest bank in Southeast\nAsia was an early adopter to using a chatbot for recruiting high-volume jobs\nin the consumer bank.\n\n[DBS created a chatbot to augment talent acquisition and was able to:\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/01/08/ten-hr-trends-in-the-\nage-of-artificial-intelligence/#223334a33219\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/01/08/ten-hr-trends-in-the-\nage-of-artificial-intelligence/#223334a33219\")\n\n  1.

[ respond to 96% of all candidate queries](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/01/08/ten-hr-trends-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/#223334a33219 \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/01/08/ten-hr-trends-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/#223334a33219\"). \n\nThis allowed DBS recruiters to perform higher-value work such as sourcing,\nrecruitment marketing, and engaging with candidates, and it even inspired them\nto create a new job role: Chatbot Coach training the chatbot with the latest\ninformation to answer candidates\u2019 queries.\n\n### **#3) Look for New Use Cases of AI 4 HR**\n\nArtificial intelligence is being used in talent acquisition at both\n[L\u2019Oreal](https://www.lorealparis.ca/en \"https://www.lorealparis.ca/en\") and\n[Hilton Hotels](https://www.hilton.com/en/ \"https://www.hilton.com/en/\") to\ndeliver significant results increasing speed to hire and allowing recruiters\nto assume more strategic roles. It\u2019s time in 2020 to expand AI to other HR\nprocesses. The range of new use cases includes Schneider Electric's launch of\nan AI powered internal talent mobility platform, Open Talent Market, and\nDaVita's pilot of an AI powered tool to report misconduct in the workplace.\n\nAndrew Saidy, vice president of talent digitization for [Schneider Electric\n](https://www.se.com \"https://www.se.com\")sees the [Open Talent\nMarket](https://lnkd.in/faVd9Yj \"https://lnkd.in/faVd9Yj\") as a one stop\ncareer development and mobility platform where employees can build a profile,\nsee the range of jobs that fit their desires, explore new career\npossibilities, and even connect to a mentor to prepare for a future role.\nSaidy believes that \"AI-powered career development is now the expectation of\ncandidates as they assess career growth and mobility opportunities at a\nprospective employer.\"\n\nSexual harassment exposed by the #metoo movement led to the development of\nanother new application of AI at work: an AI powered platform to report sexual\nmisconduct in the workplace. According to Jeff Rieb, Senior Director, People\nOperations & Innovation, [DaVita](https://www.davita.com/\n\"https://www.davita.com/\"), \"One of the many benefits of using an AI Bot to\nreport discriminatory behavior is while employees want to report these events,\nthey are reluctant to do so out of fear of retaliation. But reporting the\nincidence to a conversational bot results in a time stamped report of the\ninformation they can either send to their employer (anonymously) or hold on to\nfor potential reporting at another time.\"\n\nLook for more leading-edge use cases of AI for HR in 2020 to power every\naspect of the employee life cycle.\n\n### **#4) Focus On Building Ethical AI**\n\nAs we move into 2020, a key issue for companies will be to use AI in an\nethical and responsible manner and prove it. AI vendors and companies using AI\nplatforms may be [subjected to requirements\nsimilar](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/news/450421130/Data-\nskeptic-Cathy-ONeil-explains-why-we-need-to-regulate-algorithms\n\"https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/news/450421130/Data-skeptic-Cathy-\nONeil-explains-why-we-need-to-regulate-algorithms\") to safety checks now\nconducted on automobiles. Conducting AI audits and testing for unequal\noutcomes across gender, race, and age will start to be commonplace.\n\nConsider [California's Bot Transparency\nbill](https://www.financialservicesperspectives.com/2019/06/californias-bot-\ntransparency-law-goes-into-effect-on-july-1-2019/\n\"https://www.financialservicesperspectives.com/2019/06/californias-bot-\ntransparency-law-goes-into-effect-on-july-1-2019/\") which went into effect\nJuly 1, 2019 requiring firms to disclose when a bot rather than a human is\nanswering questions online. This is followed by a [new Illinois bill which\nsets new rules for using AI for video\ninterviews](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/state-\nand-local-updates/pages/illinois-ai-video-interviews.aspx\n\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/state-and-local-\nupdates/pages/illinois-ai-video-interviews.aspx\") and goes into effect January\n1, 2020 requiring employers to tell candidates they are using AI to analyze\nvideo interviews before asking them to record and submit an interview.\n\nBeyond understanding these emerging laws, HR leaders must be prepared for\nissues related to employee data privacy. In the Oracle and Future Workplace\nresearch, AI @ Work, conducted among [8,370 global HR leaders, employees and\nmanagers 80% of employees shared their company should ask permission before\ngathering data on them using AI and 71% said they are at least sometimes\nconcerned that there will be more data security breaches as companies use AI\nin the workplace.](https://futureworkplace.com/ebooks/aiwork-from-fear-to-\nenthusiasm/ \"https://futureworkplace.com/ebooks/aiwork-from-fear-to-\nenthusiasm/\")\n\nThere is a new competency for HR: understanding how to build ethical and\nresponsible AI.\n\n### **#5) Consider Soft Skills to Be Power Skills In 2020**\n\nAs more routine tasks are taken over by AI in the workplace, as depicted in\n[McKinsey's Global Institute report, Jobs Lots and Jobs Gained, The Workforce\nin a time of\nTransition](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Future%20of%20Organizations/What%20the%20future%20of%20work%20will%20mean%20for%20jobs%20skills%20and%20wages/MGI-\nJobs-Lost-Jobs-Gained-Executive-summary-December-6-2017.ashx\n\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Future%20of%20Organizations/What%20the%20future%20of%20work%20will%20mean%20for%20jobs%20skills%20and%20wages/MGI-\nJobs-Lost-Jobs-Gained-Executive-summary-December-6-2017.ashx\") there will be\nan increased need for workers to hone their \"soft skills,\" or what I have\ncalled \"power skills\" in the chapter I wrote for the Federal Reserve\npublication, [Navigating the Future Workplace: The New Power Skills for Jobs\nof the Future.](https://www.investinwork.org/-/media/Files/volume-\none/Power%20Skills%20for%20Jobs%20of%20the%20Future.pdf?la=en\n\"https://www.investinwork.org/-/media/Files/volume-\none/Power%20Skills%20for%20Jobs%20of%20the%20Future.pdf?la=en\") These include\na combination of soft skills, thinking skills, and digital skills. Taken\ntogether, these skills are the new expectation for employability in 2020 and\nbeyond.\n\n![Power Skills: Soft Skills, Thinking Skills, and Digital\nSkills](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e1e28efa854780006e886b2/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nPower Skills\n\nFuture Workplace\n\n  \n\nThese power skills are growing in importance and acknowledge how most jobs are\nbeing disrupted at the same time our expertise has a shorter shelf life. The\nsecret sauce to attracting and developing the next generation will be to\ndevelop these power skills. This is what Ravi Kumar, President, Infosys, is\npioneering as Infosys is recruiting for technical talent at [Rhode Island\nSchool of Design](https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/2018/design-\npartnership-RISD.html \"https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-\nreleases/2018/design-partnership-RISD.html\") and [Trinity College Liberal\nArts](https://commons.trincoll.edu/reporter/along-the-walk/trinity-infosys-\nlaunch-partnership/ \"https://commons.trincoll.edu/reporter/along-the-\nwalk/trinity-infosys-launch-partnership/\"). then training them in the hard\nskills they need to be successful in technical roles. Ravi Kumar says, \"We are\nfocusing on recruiting individuals with learnability and aptitude to operate\nat the intersection of design, technology, and industry, and not just\nrecruiting them for their current credentials.\"\n\n### **#6) Audit Your Workplace Environment for Physical, Emotional, and\nEnvironmental Attributes**\n\nWhen you think about creating a healthy workplace environment, you probably\nthink of fitness centers, standing desks, or even meditation rooms. These are\njust some of the workplace benefits that make up the $3.6 million spent on\nworkplace wellness in 2019. But is any of it paying off?\n\n[Future Workplace](https://futureworkplace.com/\n\"https://futureworkplace.com/\") and [View](https://view.com/\n\"https://view.com/\") recently [surveyed 1,601 workers across North\nAmerica](https://futureworkplace.com/future-workplace-wellness-study/\n\"https://futureworkplace.com/future-workplace-wellness-study/\") to figure out\nwhich wellness perks matter most to them and how these perks impact\nproductivity.\n\nSurprisingly, we found [employees want the basics first: better air quality,\naccess to natural light, and the ability to personalize their\nworkspace](https://hbr.org/2019/08/survey-what-employees-want-most-from-their-\nworkspaces \"https://hbr.org/2019/08/survey-what-employees-want-most-from-\ntheir-workspaces\"). Half of the employees we surveyed said poor air quality\nmakes them sleepier during the day, and more than a third reported up to an\nhour in lost productivity as a result.\n\nAfter conducting this research, we recommend heads of HR partner with Real\nEstate and Facilities leaders to take a holistic view of their workplace\nenvironment including defining workplace wellness as physical wellness,\nemotional wellness, and environmental wellness, then conduct an audit to\ndetermine how to improve all aspects of the workplace environment. You might\neven conduct this audit during the open enrollment period when employees are\nalready thinking about their health and wellbeing for the coming year!\n\n### **#7) Explore Virtual Reality for Corporate Training**\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) may not have reached its potential in the consumer market\nyet, but it is growing in corporate training. According to [ABI\nResearch](https://www.abiresearch.com/market-research/product/1027162-virtual-\nreality-in-enterprise-training/ \"https://www.abiresearch.com/market-\nresearch/product/1027162-virtual-reality-in-enterprise-training/\"): the VR\ntraining market will reach $6.3B by 2022.\n\nLeaders in this market, [Strivr](https://www.strivr.com/\n\"https://www.strivr.com/\") and [Mursion](https://www.mursion.com/\n\"https://www.mursion.com/\"), are offering VR solutions for a range of training\nas diverse as safety training, customer service training, leadership\ndevelopment, and re-inventing the employee experience. And research is showing\nthat immersive learning is able to facilitate behavior change in developing\nnew skills in the workplace.\n\nFor example, [Verizon has been using VR to train store managers and their team\non how to handle a potential store\nrobbery](https://www.strivr.com/resources/customers/verizon/\n\"https://www.strivr.com/resources/customers/verizon/\"). VR allows store\nmanagers to practice the nuances of proper response in a potential robbery.\n\nWhen the Verizon store managers were surveyed, [95% said they better\nunderstood the factors they would need to consider during an actual burglary\nattempt than when using traditional types of\ntraining.](https://fortune.com/longform/virtual-reality-struggle-hope-vr/\n\"https://fortune.com/longform/virtual-reality-struggle-hope-vr/\")\n\nDerek Belch, CEO of [Strivr](https://www.strivr.com/\n\"https://www.strivr.com/\") believes,\" the future of using VR in the workplace\nwill move beyond distinct use cases like Verizon store operations to be the\nnext generation of corporate training. VR is ideally suited for this because\nit delivers higher knowledge retention, increase engagement, and allows for\npractice before being in the situation.\"\n\nUsing VR for soft skills how [Mursion](https://www.mursion.com/\n\"https://www.mursion.com/\") is helping develop problem solving resolution\nskills among front desk employees at Best Western Hotels. To date, the\n[results have been impressive, with Best Western hotels experiencing an\naverage of 2-5% gains in post-guest satisfaction ratings and strong gains in\nproblem solving resolution training.](https://www.mursion.com/case-\nstudies/i-care-every-guest-every-time/ \"https://www.mursion.com/case-\nstudies/i-care-every-guest-every-time/\") According to Mark Atkinson, CEO of\n[Mursion](https://www.mursion.com/ \"https://www.mursion.com/\"), \"The big\nopportunity to use VR going forward is in the area of soft skills development.\nWhen we think about the skills employers need for the workforce of the future,\nit\u2019s skills like building empathy, handling conflict, and having difficult\nconversations with both co-workers and customers. VR provides workers with the\nopportunity to perform at their best in their moment of need.\"\n\n**#8) Re-Define Blended Learning To Include On Demand Coaching**\n\nMost coaching solutions are expensive, time consuming, and reserved for top\nleaders. In 2020, this seems out of sync with how we work and the changing\ndemographics of the workforce where Millennials and Gen Z now make up more\nthan 60% of global workers.\n\n[Mars, Incorporated,](https://www.mars.com/made-by-mars/petcare\n\"https://www.mars.com/made-by-mars/petcare\") the global food, petcare, and\nconfectionery company, felt that established approaches no longer met the\nneeds of their modern learners, or the increasing size, scale, and diversity\nof their company. Traditionally at Mars, leadership training was conducted in\na classroom and reached under half of first-time leaders globally. This\napproach limited accessibility and was inconsistent with Mars\u2019s egalitarian\nculture and principles.\n\nIn 2019, Summer Davies and the Mars University team reinvented the\norganizations new people leader training program by launching a fully virtual\ndevelopment program called Great Line Management Experience, or GLMe. GLMe\ncombines digitally delivered content supported by on-demand, personalized\ncoaching.\n\nThe solution created by Mars University was blending virtually delivered\nleadership development training with an on-demand coaching experience from\n[BetterUp](https://www.betterup.com/ \"https://www.betterup.com/\") that is\nconvenient, accessible, and impactful while meeting the needs of Mars\u2019s\nevolving workforce.\n\nTo date, more than 2,000 new leaders have participated in the program. The\ndesign has given new meaning to \"blended learning,\" which no longer means\ncombining inherently limited face-to-face training with online training but is\nnow democratized to include on-demand coaching as well.\n\n### **#9) Recruit for Skills Rather Than College Pedigree**\n\nMore companies are piloting skills based hiring, or the practice of setting\nspecific skills and competency requirements for a job rather than only looking\nat a candidate's credentials _._ Many companies realize they need to tap into\nnew sources and relax some of the requirements they held in the past to find\ncandidates for open positions. [According to\nGlassDoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/no-degree-required/\n\"https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/no-degree-required/\"), companies as varied as\nApple, Bank of America, Google, and Nordstrom will now consider and hire\ncandidates without a college degree as a requirement.\n\n[Research conducted by Wiley Educational Services and Future Workplace with\n600 HR Leaders found the majority of companies are open to hiring \"non-\ntraditional workers.\u201d](https://edservices.wiley.com/closing-the-skills-gap-\nreport-2019/ \"https://edservices.wiley.com/closing-the-skills-gap-\nreport-2019/\") More than half (53%) would hire someone with some college\ncoursework but no degree, or a person who had not attended college but earned\nindustry certification (52%), while only 10% said they would not hire someone\nwho didn\u2019t have a college degree. (Wiley/Future Workplace Study).\n\n![53% of survey respondents would hire someone with some college coursework\nbut no degree.](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e1e2c83da6d38000629960f/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nNon-Traditional Hiring\n\nFuture Workplace\n\nIn addition to sourcing non-traditional candidates outside of four year\ncolleges, companies are expanding their recruiting channels to include boot\ncamps, company sponsored Hackathons, apprenticeships, and partnerships with\ncommunity based organizations like [LRGN](https://www.lrng.org/\n\"https://www.lrng.org/\") offering training in cities across the US to close\nlocal skills gap.\n\nOne company that is making progress in sourcing non-traditional talent is [The\nHartford](https://www.thehartford.com/ \"https://www.thehartford.com/\"), which\ncreated an apprenticeship program developed in partnership with Connecticut\nDepartment of Labor, Capital Community College, and Rio Salado College. The\nobjective is to develop an auto insurance specific curriculum and paid on-the-\njob training to equip students for key customer-facing roles in The Hartford\u2019s\nclaims operation. Mark Wagner, Vice President of Learning at The Hartford,\nsays, \"We are actually going one step beyond the apprenticeships to offering\ncoaching and mentoring to enable success of these new hires.\u201d\n\n**#10) Make Your Workplace Experience  A Top Priority**\n\nIn my book, [The Future Workplace Experience](https://www.amazon.com/Future-\nWorkplace-Experience-Disruption-\nRecruiting/dp/1259589382/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1XI651R8VF9KL&keywords=the+future+workplace+experience&qid=1570388504&s=books&sprefix=the+future+workplace%2Caps%2C285&sr=1-1\n\"https://www.amazon.com/Future-Workplace-Experience-Disruption-\nRecruiting/dp/1259589382/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1XI651R8VF9KL&keywords=the+future+workplace+experience&qid=1570388504&s=books&sprefix=the+future+workplace%2Caps%2C285&sr=1-1\"),\n\"the last best experience anyone has anywhere becomes their minimum\nexpectation for the type of experiences they want everywhere, and especially\nin the workplace.\" Workplace experience is the application of user experience\nto the workplace, re-imagining the physical, digital, and cultural aspects of\nwork. This \"employee as customer mindset\" requires a total re-thinking of the\nmoments that matter to segments of employees \u2013 those starting their first day\non the job to those exiting the organization. Work needs to be as friction\nless, digital, and personalized as the rest of our lives.\n\nHR leaders at companies ranging from [IBM ](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/?ar=1\n\"https://www.ibm.com/us-en/?ar=1\") [Airbnb ](https://www.airbnb.com/\n\"https://www.airbnb.com/\")to [HP ](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html\n\"https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html\")are executing on this by forming cross\nfunctional teams of HR, Real Estate, and IT and developing a shared vision to\nidentify moments that matter to various segments of workers. As Diane Gherson,\nCHRO of IBM says,\u201d [Our job in HR is to create that connected, transparent,\nmobile, personalized, searchable and 24x7 universe through our workplace and\nour tools.\u201d ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2018/08/06/ibms-hr-\nchief-shares-best-advice-on-the-future-of-work/#70a36bde3dc4\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2018/08/06/ibms-hr-chief-shares-\nbest-advice-on-the-future-of-work/#70a36bde3dc4\") This means creating an\nemployee experience which mirrors our best customer experience!

Fugro\n> identified competency and skills management as a key business process in\n> this journey. \u201cWe work with our clients on specialized projects that require\n> our staff to have proven technical competency to perform these jobs,\u201d said\n> Darren Walley, Global Competence Manager. \u201cIt was clear from the beginning\n> that Kahuna was the competency management system of choice as it fits\n> perfectly with our technical competency framework. Since January, we have\n> rolled out the system to the Global Remote Operated Vehicle and Diving\n> operations, with the survey frameworks to be released in October. Benefits\n> to the company, our clients and personnel are already becoming apparent due\n> to being able to select specific personnel based on competence, and an\n> increase in personnel engagement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorking with Fugro is exciting because the nature of their business requires\nthe use of leading-edge technology. We are helping Fugro optimize its\nworkforce in keeping up with the ever-changing technology landscape and\noperate safely with high service quality,\u201d said Jai Shah, CEO of Kahuna\nWorkforce Solutions.\n\nHaving transparency in job requirements also benefits Fugro\u2019s employees. The\nKahuna platform provides employees clear visibility into global job\nrequirements and allows for consistency in skill assessments. This approach\nengages and empowers employees in their career development while reducing bias\nin the promotion process.\n\nBecause Kahuna is a [fit-for-purpose\napplication](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fkahunaworkforce.com%2Fsolutions%2Ffeatures%2F&esheet=52115150&newsitemid=20191022005223&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=fit-for-\npurpose+application&index=3&md5=2936d53685f78af7c5250053f892a8bb), integration\nto the global Fugro IT landscape was of paramount importance. Kahuna\u2019s ability\nto integrate with Workday\u00ae, Fugro\u2019s chosen platform for core HR processes, was\ncritical to success. The integration works in both directions. Core employee\ndata is managed in Workday and passed to Kahuna. Competency assignments and\nassessments are managed in Kahuna and passed in real-time back to Workday. The\nresult is that anyone (HR, supervisors, or employees) can run a report in\nWorkday and see a comprehensive talent profile inclusive of competencies and\nall systems stay in sync without manual intervention.\n\nErwin Hoogeveen, Fugro\u2019s Chief Human Resources Officer, added, \u201cIt was\nexciting working with the Kahuna team to make this a success. They understood\nour business and worked with our team to deliver a state-of-the-art solution\nin time and fully integrated with our Workday solution. The commitment and\npassion of both the Kahuna and Fugro teams made the difference and, since\ndeploying Kahuna to the field, we\u2019ve already received great feedback.\u201d\n\n**About Fugro**\n\nWe are the world\u2019s leading Geo-data specialist, collecting and analyzing\ncomprehensive information about the Earth and the structures built upon it.\nThrough integrated data acquisition, analysis and advice, we unlock insights\nfrom Geo-data to help our clients design, build and operate their assets in a\nsafe, sustainable, and efficient manner.

Employee Engagement\n\nEmployee engagement was the most critical issue for the second straight year.\nEmployee engagement covers many areas, including retaining high-performing\ntalent, fortifying the employee-employer relationship, managing performance\nand creating an energizing culture.\n\nResearch shows that the top reason workers leave a job is because they are\nunhappy with their manager, but other things that turn off employees are a\nlack of trust in senior management and the perception that the company values\nmaking money more than its workers' well-being.\n\nThat's a good reason for employers to invest in training managers on coaching\nand providing feedback, encouraging employees with frequent personalized\nrecognition, and treating employees like adults, Currence said.\n\nChanneling President John F. Kennedy, Currence said that employers should \"Ask\nnot what your employees can do for you, but what you can do for your\nemployees.\"\n\nHR can also increase employee engagement by offering learning opportunities\nand health and wellness initiatives and by asking employees for their\nimprovement suggestions.\n\n2\\. Talent Acquisition\n\nCurrence said she had expected this result: Attracting and hiring talent is\none of solo practitioners' top concerns, especially with U.S. unemployment at\na record low and recruiters reporting increasing difficulty finding the talent\nthey need. Average time-to-fill is 42 days, she said.\n\nEmployer branding and digital presence is essential, Currence said. Talent\nacquisition teams can find prospective employees on sites like LinkedIn and\nFacebook, ensure visibility on job boards, and develop a proactive reputation\nmanagement strategy for Glassdoor and other employer review sites.\n\nCurrence recommended that solo practitioners advertise career development\nopportunities and showcase employee testimonials and employer branding videos\non the company's careers site and social media.\n\nShe also recommended improving recruiting processes, looking for bottlenecks\nand shortening time-to-hire.\n\n3\\. Leadership\n\nLeadership ties very closely with the HR competency of business acumen,\nCurrence said. Survey respondents said that they felt HR still has a long way\nto go to be taken seriously enough to be included in major business decisions.\n\"To gain credibility, first understand the 'why and how' of building a\nbusiness strategy\u2014I'm talking specifics,\" she said. \"Applying what you know\nabout the business when leading and promoting change and executing key HR\ninitiatives is showing leadership.\"\n\nCurrence recommended attendees use [SHRM's competency assessment\ntools](/learningandcareer/career/pages/accelerate-your-career.aspx) to gauge\ntheir HR skills and competencies and guide them toward further training and\ndevelopment.\n\n4\\. Communication\n\nDelivering, receiving and translating messages up and down the organizational\nchain is the foundation for HR's success in an organization, Currence said.\n\n\"Too many organizations are siloed,\" she said. \"Employees crave cross-\nfunctional interaction. Think about what happens when people don't know what\nother people are doing. Processes are all askew.\"\n\nWays to break down those siloes include holding all-hands meetings in person\nso colleagues can talk to one another face-to-face, conducting\u2014and acting on\nthe results of\u2014employee engagement surveys, and onboarding new hires properly.\n\n\"Onboarding is so important,\" Currence said. \"Onboarding can be a great way to\nintroduce new hires to other people in the organization, breaking down siloes\nfrom the beginning.\"\n\nShe also recommended using behavioral assessments to understand how different\nindividuals communicate.\n\n5\\. Business Acumen\n\nA strong understanding of the business allows HR to make decisions quickly and\nconfidently.\n\n\"In order to have a seat at the table, HR needs to know how its efforts are\naffecting the bottom line and the strategic goals of the organization,\" she\nsaid. \"Being strategic for HR means aligning HR programs with the goals of the\norganization.\"\n\nSome of the areas HR departments of one need to know about to do this include\nfinance, strategy, sales, marketing and operations, as well as understanding\nthe company's industry and competition.\n\nAnother way of thinking about business acumen is knowing what's best for the\ncompany, Currence said.\n\nShe shared that one of the best learning experiences she ever had was when she\nwas a solo practitioner at a sales organization years ago and was going on a\nride-along with a sales manager to understand the business from the ground up.\n\n\"When thinking of ways to enhance your business acumen, be creative, make sure\nyou relate your efforts to the business and, if all else fails, just ask\nquestions,\" she said.  \n\n[Leadership and Navigation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Leadership and\nNavigation) [Business Acumen](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Business\nAcumen) [Communication](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Communication)\n[Employee Relations](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Employee Relations)\n[Organization and Employee\nDevelopment](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Organization and Employee\nDevelopment)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+Top+5+Priorities+for+HR+Departments+of+One&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/hr-\ntoday/news/hr-news/Pages/Top-5-Priorities-HR-Departments-of-One.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

Thus, it is a process that helps in determining the gap\nbetween the present skills and competencies and the preferred skills and\ncompetencies. A talent gap analysis helps you fill the gaps in your\norganizational talentscape to build a competent, committed, and creative\nworkforce.\n\nFor example, conducting a talent or skill gap analysis could help you pinpoint\nthat with the volume of new projects coming in, there will be a shortage in\nyour design team for a mid-senior level UX designer in three months. With that\nin mind, you can now start your hunt for the right talent. This may be a\nrather simplistic instance, but then again, a t times, we just need to connect\npeople with business outcomes in the most simplistic and obvious of ways to\ndrive success.\n\n## **The Process of Talent Gap Analysis**\n\nThe process of talent gap analysis rests on four primary steps. While the\ntools to execute this process may change from one organization to the other\nbased on the size of the workforce, budget constraints, sector, and even the\nculture within the company, its basic pillars remain the same.\n\nThese four steps of the talent gap analysis process are as follows:\n\n### **Step 1: Plan smart**\n\n  \nAny analysis requires data, planning, and forethought. Organizations work at\ntwo levels \u2013 **the individual level and the organizational level**. When it\ncomes to charting the path ahead at the individual level, it helps to get a\nsense of the skills required to carry out a certain role and to then map the\nemployee\u2019s current skill level to that role. Based on this pre-analysis, the\nnecessary steps can then be taken.\n\nPlanning at the organizational level requires you to look at your team of\nemployees as a whole to check what skills and competencies could be upgraded\nthrough training and which ones would require recruiting from external\nsources.\n\nThere are skills tracking and competency-mapping tools like Skills Base and\nSkills DB Pro that can aid with the process of planning an effective talent\ngap analysis.\n\n### **Step 2: Map a skills hierarchy**\n\n  \nTo understand where the gaps are in your talent tapestry, it is necessary to\nsegregate skills into a hierarchy based on **immediacy, applicability, and\nsustainability**. While company values such as agility, flexibility, and\ncreative competency often dictate when and how you need to upgrade your\ncollective skill set to stay relevant, the three points mentioned above act as\neffective guides.\n\nSkills that score high on immediacy are the ones that you need now or in the\nvery near future. The applicability of a skill or talent can be measured in\nterms of how easy the transfer of training is from a learning environment to\nthe actual work environment.\n\nThe sustainability of a skill refers to the potential of the skill to stay\nrelevant in the future. With this hierarchy in place, you now have a map in\nterms of where to wish to see your organization in specific time spans.\n\n![The process of talent gap analysis](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n_Figure 1. The process of talent gap analysis_\n\n### **Step 3: Plot the current state of skills**\n\n  \nOnce you know the talent and the levels of skills that you need, how do you\nsee the gaps? By **plotting the current state of skills on your vision map**.\nMethods of tracking where the organization stands at present in terms of the\nskills vision map include assessments and surveys that employees and their\nmanagers could fill out, in-depth employee interviews, and performance\nreviews.\n\nSoftware tools such as TrackStar make this process a little simpler and less\ntime-consuming. That said, the depth of data that can be gained through\ninterviews cannot be paralleled by most other dipstick methods. If your\ncurrent **state of skills** is much below par, it really is an SOS for\nimmediate action.\n\n### **Step 4: Execute, execute, execute**\n\n  \nHow do you kill it in the talent game? You execute your plan of action! Any\nskill or talent gap can be filled in either of two ways \u2013 **training or\nrecruitment**. Once you know where your gaps lie and how big the hiatus is\nbetween where you are and where you wish to be, execution is the key.\n\nWhat do you do with the data? The debate then becomes whether your present\nemployees are at a trainable level to enable the skills vision or whether you\nneed to acquire new talent who already possess the required skill level. Both\ndecisions require investment in terms of energy, time, and finances, but you\nneed to decide based on projected ROIs and your organizational needs.\n\n## **After the Talent Gap Analysis**\n\nNow that you know what your talent gaps are, what do you do to ensure that\nyour organization moves forward? Granted, that the two inevitable choices are\ntraining and recruitment, but that cannot be all that an in-depth talent gap\nanalysis leads to.\n\nLike a training need analysis only points to where the lack of talent lies, a\ntalent gap analysis is a compass as well. Yes, your immediate course of action\nshould be to fill the gap by either upgrading present skills or by welcoming\nexternal skills, but learnings from a talent gap analysis can be applied\nfurther.\n\n**Learn More:** **[How to Become a Smart Recruitment Specialist in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-to-\nbecome-a-smart-recruitment-specialist/)**\n\n## **Talent Gap Analysis for the Smart HR Manager**\n\nAs the digital skills gap widens and we move towards 2020, the smart HR\nmanager needs to pause, take stock of current talent processes, and rejig the\nways of work. Frontrunners like IBM already have a model in place to [close\nthe skills gap](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/how-can-organizations-close-the-skills-gap-ibm-offers-an-\nanswer/).\n\nWhen it comes to closing the skill gap in 2020 and beyond, be mindful of the\nfollowing as you go about your talent gap analysis:\n\n### **1\\. Regard expertise as the simplest currency**\n\n  \nAs the market shifts gears, you need to shift your focus to the value of\nbuilding an expertise-driven culture. That is how the skills gap can truly be\nclosed \u2013 by not just reactively developing the necessary skills but by\nadapting proactively and adopting skills before they become the trend.\n\n### **2\\. Truly understand your workforce**\n\n  \nHow many HR managers today can honestly claim to actually know what their\ntalent needs and wants? The smart HR leader of the future needs to develop a\nmuch deeper understanding of the present workforce. Only then will they be\nable to plan for their growth and expansion. This understanding must be beyond\nbasic data from surveys and extend to changing global political, economic, and\nsociological trends to provide a holistic, humanized, and collaborative\nunderstanding of talent gaps.\n\n### **3\\. Enable internal mobility**\n\n  \nMobility within the organization is a big positive when it comes to improving\n[employee engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-engagement/) and elevating the overall employee\nexperience. This also creates a meaningful career path for all employees and\nallows the organization to fill skill gaps from within the system with\nhomegrown talent.\n\n### **4\\. Power learning with AI**\n\n  \nAfter a talent gap analysis, once you know which areas need focus, AI can be\nthe partner you need to build a culture of learning, curiosity, and agility.\nTools that use [AI in learning and\ndevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/definitive-guide-to-ai-in-learning-and-development/) provide\nthe option of smaller modules of learning that seem less daunting, are more\nengaging with gamified content, and that encourage collaboration within teams.\n\n### **5\\. Be open to new ways of work**\n\n  \nWith wider, dynamic talent gaps emerging, there is often an influx of new\n[multigenerational\ntalent](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/3-tips-on-managing-a-\nmultigenerational-workforce/) within the organization. This presupposes the\nneed to adapt effectively to new ways of work, different perspectives, and a\nrich diversity of ideas.\n\n### **6\\. Place focus on continuous improvement**\n\n  \n[Continuous improvement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-\nanalytics/why-hr-analytics-is-the-key-to-continuous-improvement/) holds true\nwhen it comes to talent gap analysis as well. In fact, identifying and filling\nup talent gaps is in itself an attempt at improvement and being better. As a\nsmart HR manager, you need to drive the vision of evolution and of encouraging\ntoday\u2019s talent to be better tomorrow.\n\n## **Bridging the Talent Gap**\n\nUnderstanding the talent gaps could help in the formulation of better training\nmodules for existing employees and more intelligent assessments for\ncandidates. Bridging the talent gap is not a one-time activity and needs to be\ninvested in throughout the year to create a culture of proactive awareness and\naction. Moreover, the fact that talent gaps do arise needs to be viewed in a\npositive light and used as impetus to build and foster a culture of continuous\nlearning, adaptability, and agility.\n\n_What are the challenges you face in a talent gap analysis?

According to Lim, while many of Shopee's young leaders are\n\"exceptional in their own domain\", they are also first-time managers who have\nfaced steep learning curves.\n\nHe says: \"Even for experienced managers who have led teams before, our rapid\ngrowth means that they have had to adapt and manage bigger teams.\"\n\nThe solution? A competency-based, systematic and holistic approach towards\nleadership development, shares Lim. This approach integrates programmes for\nnew and aspiring managers to align on practices of developing high-performing\nteams, as well as tailored programmes for five levels of leadership\nexperience.\n\nAdditional programmes and resources are also available, which include coaching\nand mentoring programmes; organisation-wide feedback tools to identify\nleadership development needs; regular sharing sessions by senior leaders; and\ndedicated in-house leadership trainers and training partners.\n\n\"Our approach necessitates heavy involvement from top management.\"\n\n> ##### Together, with the dedication of our talented professionals within the\n> learning and development team, we are able to build a learning culture.\n\nTo facilitate this culture, the company's Shopee Academy provides foundational\nmodules that introduce first-time leaders to leadership, as well as more\nadvanced modules for experienced leaders.\n\nThe first step into Shopee's learning and development modules takes place\nthrough an intensive regional onboarding programme for managers, where\nexperiential activities highlight the importance of the leadership culture and\ncompetencies. These managers also attend deep-dive sessions to improve their\nunderstanding of Shopee's key business functions. Over 350 leaders have been\ninvolved in this programme since its inception in 2018.\n\nSecond, the academy offers five tiers of leadership development programmes\ndesigned to meet the needs of Shopee's leaders at different stages. Every\nleader in the organisation is invited to participate in the tailored, two-day\ntraining programmes each year.\n\nThe range of programmes include leadership masterclasses (conducted\nexternally); two-hour training courses; brown-bag sessions by senior leaders;\npanel discussions; learning networking sessions; and subsidies for online or\nexternal training.\n\nWithin the first quarter of 2019, more than 450 leaders across the region have\nparticipated in these programmes.\n\nIn addition to the above, Shopee also chose to integrate its current coaching\nprogramme with its leadership programme so as to ensure continuity in its\nstaff learning while emphasising on the application of learning.\n\nLike in every implementation, the team at Shopee has faced some challenges\nalong the way in implementing this gamut of programmes. Lim explains: \"One of\nour challenges in implementing our coaching and mentoring programmes was the\nlimited numbers of coaches and mentors we had, in relation to the number of\nemployees interested in the programmes.\"\n\nIn fact, he admits that the mentoring programme is widely popular, with more\nthan 100 mentors and 300 mentees benefitting from the programme.\n\nTo address this, he shares: \"We learned that senior management support, role-\nmodelling from senior leaders, sharing of success stories, and proper training\nby Shopee's learning and development team, helped to motivate coaches and\nmentors in investing their time and effort.\"\n\n\"Many have commented that they have learnt a lot through the programmes\nthemselves!\"\n\n### Looking towards 2020: What\u2019s on the agenda?\n\nCurrently, Lim believes there is a shortage of talent, especially leaders with\nspecialised tech experience and skills suitable for the eCommerce industry.\n\nFurther, he says: \"Transitioning from tech professionals to leadership\npositions can be rather challenging.\n\n\"Therefore, a formalised, progressive development programme for tech leaders\ncould focus on building critical tech leadership skills, based on the specific\nchallenges faced within tech teams.\"![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/22105026/Screenshot-2019-08-22-at-10.49.17-700x446.png)\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n_This case study was part of a feature on leadership development, which\nappeared in the June-July edition of[Human Resources magazine\n(Singapore)](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/).

It becomes even more\ncomplex when we have vague answers or no answers to questions like what is\nneeded, why it\u2019s needed, when it\u2019s needed and how to go about it. Here are a\nfew reasons why traditional hiring processes fail to deliver desired results:\n\n  * Lack of proper competency profile for a role\n  * Hiring for perceptions rather than competencies\n  * Unclear expectations from the role/resource\n  * Inability to match candidate profile with competency profile\n\nThus, having a structured competency-based hiring process in place helps\nhiring the best candidate for available roles. It should then come as no\nsurprise that most global organizations have a competency-based hiring model\nin place that supports a robust recruitment process.\n\n### Creating Competency Profiles\n\nCreating competency profiles for a role includes mapping various competencies\nrequired for a candidate to successfully perform that role. It includes:\n\n  1. Identifying key competencies\n  2. Identifying the importance of each competency for a particular role\n\nIn order to understand this better, let\u2019s consider the competency profiles of\na manager and a coordinator. For a managerial role, \u2018leadership skills\u2019 might\nhold a very high importance; however, the same competency is absolutely not\nneeded for a coordinator role. Similarly, for a coordinator role,\n\u2018understanding & translating instructions for task accomplishment\u2019 might hold\na very high importance; however the same competency is not needed for a\ncoordinator role.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to understand that every role has a different competency profile,\nand hence, also has a different interview assessment criterion. This\nnecessitates the need for preparing a well thought of competency profile for\nany role before starting the hiring process. We must remember that there are\nno tailor-made candidates; however, someone with the relevant competencies can\nalways be trained to become a perfect fit.\n\n### Designing competency-based interview questions\n\nAssessing on competencies can be tricky but it\u2019s really worthwhile to train\nthe hiring managers on acquiring this skill for effective hiring. One of the\nkey lessons here to understand that past behavior is the best indicator of\nfuture performance. Competency-based interview questions are designed to let\nthe candidate talk; they are open-ended and they invite a response that tells\nthe employer about a real-life challenge that candidate has faced and how they\nreacted. It\u2019s easy for a trained hiring manager to distinguish between a\nrehearsed answer and a genuine answer.\n\nThe key to designing competency-based interview questions is to interpret the\nresponses properly and match the responses with the requirement of the role.\nQuestions that encourage the candidate to probe and reflect are usually used\nto understand the candidate and determine if they are a right fit. You can use\nthe STAR approach to design competency-based questions:\n\n**S/T-** Create a Situation or a Task\n\n**A-** Seek the action taken in that situation by the candidate\n\n**R-** Seek the final outcome/result of that action & candidate\u2019s reaction to\nit.\n\nHere are some examples of competency-based questions to assess different\nskills in a candidate:\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1567855891/Shruti1_sthyng.png)\n\n### Evaluating competency-based interviews\n\nInterpretation of answers to competency-based questions goes beyond\nunderstanding the meaning of plain words. The use of the probing technique can\nhelp undertake the best assessment of a candidate\u2019s reaction. For example, for\na question such as \"Describe a time when you had to deal with pressure\", the\npositive and negative indicators may be as follows:\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1567855891/Shruti2_zc66s5.png)\n\n### Structured interviews: Eliminating perceptual bias\n\nStructured Interviews- Each candidate for a role is evaluated against the\nexactly same functional, technical & behavioral competencies that are\nessentially decided in the competency-profile of the role with the same\nimportance. Interview Questions mostly remain similar for every candidate. For\nexample, interviewers can rate the same candidate in the following manner and\nderive at the average:\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1567855891/Shruti3_noohce.png)\n\nAssessment profiles like the one shown above can be created for all the\ncandidates, and the ones with the best rating can be selected for the next\nround. These can then be tallied with the functional or technical competencies\n(which are based on more factual information) to take the final decision.\nSince we are keeping the behavioral skills constant for each competing\ncandidate and the final score is arrived at by considering 3 different\nevaluations, chances of perception-based short-listing are largely eliminated.\n\nAt the end of the day, misfits are bound to be hired, and the right fits are\nbound to become misfits if we do not do the groundwork properly. Resources\nemployed with confused expectations from the hiring managers are bound to\nfail. Hence it becomes critical that have a concrete answer to deciding how\nand why we choose which candidate and a replicable strategy to implement it.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Talent

The group operates under two brands: Deutsche Post provides postal\nservices to Europe and DHL offers international express, freight\ntransportation, e-commerce and supply chain management services.\n\n<https://www.dpdhl.com/en.html>\n\nLindsay Bridges, Senior Vice President of HR, Deutsche Post DHL (DPDHL) Supply\nChain, UK and Ireland, has worked at DHL for 25 years. Bridges began her\ncareer at DHL in an operational role before moving to HR. Over the last 12\nyears, Bridges has led HR functions in multiple regions around the world.\nToday, Bridges leads the HR function for the UK and Ireland.\n\n<https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsay-bridges-6866464/?originalSubdomain=uk>\n\nBridges describes DHL as, \u201ca diverse, and globally connected business, that is\nexciting to work for. The opportunity to progress and develop within the\ncompany both in the UK and abroad for the individual is endless. Many of our\ncolleagues have moved around the world with the company.\u201d Over the last 16\nmonths, Bridges has not only been focusing on traditional HR functions of\ntalent learning and development, but driving engagement and a change in\nculture too. \u201cWe want to strengthen our core business, DHL\u2019s Strategy 2025\nprovides a framework for accelerating opportunities,\u201d says Bridges, who\nhighlights that talent management is an important aspect of her role.\n\n\u201cLogistics is a marketplace driven by the employee,\u201d continues Bridges. \u201cIt is\nimportant that our talent strategy ensures DHL hires and manages its employees\neffectively in order to develop their skills and progress them within the\nbusiness.\u201d In order to do so, DHL uses a lifecycle approach that clearly maps\nout an employee\u2019s journey. \u201cThere are key \u2018moments that matter in an\nemployee\u2019s journey that are an integral aspect of how we manage and maintain\ntalent,\u201d says Bridges. When it comes to retaining talent, Bridges acknowledges\nthat expectations are changing, \u201ccandidates want to work for more than just a\npay cheque. They want a flexible career, clear progression and managers that\nact as mentors,\u201d continues Bridges. With the help of data analytics, DHL has\nbeen developing these key areas to further improve inclusivity as well as\nincrease staff retention. \u201cOur data points - generated by running focus and\nlistening groups - show us that those who have clearly defined career paths\nstay with us longer,\u201d comments Bridges. \u201cWe\u2019ve used this data to create\nbespoke employee journeys, tailored to specific groups of individuals,\u201d she\nadds. To manage performance at DHL, \u201ccolleagues have regular feedback sessions\nwith their line managers to ensure there is a two-way conversation about\nperformance which is then fed into a bespoke employee map outlining their\njourney, objectives and goals.\u201d Bridges also notes, in 2019, DHL piloted an\nemployee experience management tool which includes coaching, mentoring and\npractical development plans.\n\nLooking back on the evolution of HR functions, Bridges highlights that \u201cHR has\nshifted. Strategic HR has always been on the agenda but it is being elevated.\u201d\nDHL\u2019s talent strategy is now focused on making its recruitment process more\nefficient and effective using \u2018competency-based\u2019 recruiting and automation.\n\u201cWe want to better develop managers and leaders through programmes to\nreinforce culture, instil values, and create a sustainable leadership.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to maintaining and developing talent, DHL offers its employees a\n\u2018Certified Specialist Programme\u2019 that provides a suite of products, delivered\nby subject matter experts to enhance leadership, operations and functions\ncapabilities. \u201cWe place emphasis on practical application of learning and on\nthe job learning, while empowering colleagues to take control of their\ndevelopment,\u201d says Bridges. In addition to the company\u2019s \u2018Certified Specialist\nProgramme\u2019, DHL wants to upskill its workforce at all levels, through tailored\nprogrammes that align to business needs and priorities. \u201cWe have developed our\nown training schools for warehouse colleagues and drivers looking to progress\nthrough our operations as well as for employees leading a department and\nlooking to make the next steps into senior management.\u201d DHL also partners with\nspecialist training providers to offer apprenticeship schemes ranging from a\nlevel two qualification (equivalent to two GCSE\u2019s) through to a level seven\nqualification (equivalent to a Masters).\n\nWith sustainability and digital transformation being key 2019 trends within\nthe business world, Bridges highlights that it is talent and good leadership\nthat provides DHL with a competitive advantage. \u201cWe continuously communicate\nwith our colleagues, ensuring they have the necessary tools to upskill where\nneeded. As we adopt cleaner and greener technology into our fleet, we make\nsure our drivers are fully informed and coached.\u201d In addition, DHL now offers\na robotics engineer apprenticeship for employees to upskill their talent as\ntechnology continues to advance.\n\nReflecting on the company, Bridges believes that DHL\u2019s \u2018Certified Specialist\nProgramme\u2019 is the company\u2019s biggest success to date within talent management,\nwhich the company will be continuing to develop to ensure cohesion across the\nbusiness. In addition, Bridges advocates that DHL\u2019s strengths when it comes to\ntalent management are, its global presence, its employee journey mapping\nprocess and its talent programmes. \u201cWe have defined the moments that matter\nthe most to our employees and this has had a positive effect on onboarding,\nengagement, retention and productivity metrics.\u201d\n\nDHL continues to aspire to be agile enough to quickly identify competency gaps\nto deliver training, e-learning, or development programs where needed, as well\nas utilising these gaps to inform how the company hires the right people.\n\nFor more information on all topics for Procurement, Supply Chain & Logistics -\nplease take a look at the latest edition of [Supply Chain

These synergies help both the employee and\nthe employer, create realistic future plans, identify individual and\ncollective weaknesses, increase motivation and productivity, and eventually\nleads to higher retention of top talent.\n\nLet us take a look at how HR will help employees build sustainable careers in\nthe future:\n\n### Champion change\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that HR needs to do to help employees build a stable and\ndurable career, it is to equip them with skills and help them embrace\ncontinuous learning. There is no denying that the skill requirement by\nbusinesses is changing rapidly, and a significant portion of the workforce\nmight be rendered unemployable in the near future. This naturally creates a\nchallenge, and an opportunity, for HR to provide the right training in\ntechnical and soft skills. HR must not get caught up in job titles,\nremunerations, or numbers, and consider helping employees learn new skills as\na mandatory transitory exercise into the future of work. The end goal is to\nhelp each employee identify their strengths, work upon their weakness, and\nmake changes to the overall career direction.\n\n### Facilitate lateral movement\n\nAs a direct consequence of the above, HR will also be expected to build\ndedicated programs that facilitate lateral movement, job rotation, cross-\ntraining, mentoring, and transfers within the organizations based on the right\nskill set and competency. Besides, to conduct regular skill and competency\nassessments, HR will also have to lead focused career development discussions\nwith employees to help them understand current opportunities within the\norganizations, provide career-related feedback and advice, and relate current\nperformance and challenges to future potential in realistic ways. These\nstrategies will also arise in response to higher attrition levels and a dearth\nof quality talent. Lateral movement and intra-organization transfers will not\nonly make it easier for organizations to train willing talent as required but\nalso ensure that the employees continue to fit in culturally.\n\n### Help employees re-enter the workforce\n\nThe next component of helping employees in career planning will be re-entry\nprograms for employees on breaks. In a talent-starved market, employers are\nbeginning to see the benefit of allowing employees to go on sabbaticals for\npersonal or learning purposes and assuring them of re-joining the\norganization. While several organizations have \u2018Back-to-Work\u2019 programs and\npolicies for women, the ambit needs to be increased to all employees who wish\nto take a break. Naturally, HR will have to ensure that employees going on\nbreaks return to the organization once they are ready to re-join the\nworkforce. This includes building and maintaining communication channels once\nthey have left, supporting them during their sabbatical, and helping them\nadjust to the changes once they are back. Having formal re-entry programs in\nplace will secure employment for talented and willing individuals after a\nsabbatical, but also ensure a diverse workforce.\n\nTo excel in this role, HR leaders and professionals must realize that their\nrole goes beyond supporting employees in their current position. They must\nidentify that helping employees navigate their career is not only a way to\ndemonstrate commitment, but also an opportunity to establish an ongoing\ndialogue with the workforce. The underlying questions that can help HR\nprofessionals undertake meaningful career development for their employees\nmight seem trivial or simplistic. However, they offer profound insights into\nhow the people working in the organization are thinking. To help businesses\nthrive in the future and ensure that they enjoy recurring talent benefits, HR\nleaders must begin investing in their people today and ensure that they are\npoised to succeed in their respective careers.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Strategic HR](/category/leadership-strategy/strategic-\nhr?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=strategic-hr \"Browse more in:

While kindness has a part to play in our\neveryday lives, when we think about public policy (not just what the strategic\ndirection is, but how we implement it) where does kindness feature? Jessica\nSellick investigates._\n\n* * *\n\nBack in 1931 an American judge called **[Oliver Wendell\nHolmes](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes_Jr.)** described\nhow the interpretation of constitutional principles must not be too literal in\nreminding us how _\u201cthe machinery of Government would not work if it were not\nallowed a little play in its joints.\u201d_ People\u2019s views on public policy can\noscillate between \u2018harshness\u2019 with policy makers seen as treating people worse\nthan they deserve, or \u2018generosity\u2019 where policy makers are seen as treating\npeople better than they deserve. Nowhere are such debates more prevalent than\naround social welfare policy where issues such as \u2018need\u2019, \u2018entitlement\u2019, who\nis or should \u2018deserve\u2019 benefits or how the system should \u2018incentivise people\nto help themselves\u2019 are prevalent. This can lead to trade-offs being made in\nhow eligibility criteria is set and welfare support administered. In a rural\ncontext, debates persist over the funding formulas used to decide \u2018what\u2019 and\n\u2018how\u2019 public services are provided [are we distributing resources in a fair\nand equitable way for rural residents?] With ever-increasing demands being\nplaced on public services, amid fewer resources and the rising expectations of\nsome service users, can or should kindness help us navigate some of these\ndebates and issues?\n\n###### **What is kindness?**\n\nKindness is an elusive concept \u2013 we recognise it in our everyday lives and yet\nfind it difficult to define.\n\nThe term derives from the Middle English word \u2018kindenes\u2019 meaning \u2018noble deeds\u2019\nor \u2018courtesy\u2019. Its philosophy can be traced back to Aristotle and Book II of\n**[Rhetoric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric_\\(Aristotle\\))** in which\nhe defines kindness as _\"helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return\nfor anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself, but for that of the\nperson helped.\u201d_ Nietzsche considered kindness to be \u2018curative herbs and\nagents.\u2019 In religion, Buddhists view kindness as the act of \u2018doing things for\nanother person, without substantial motivation\u2019. The Christian apostle Paul\nlists kindness as one of the nine traits considered to be the \" **[fruit of\nthe Spirit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_Spirit)** \". Judaism\nteaches that \u2018the world is built on kindness.\u2019 In literature, Mark Twain\nconsidered kindness as a _\u201clanguage which the deaf can hear and the blind can\nsee.\"_ While Charles Darwin\u2019s work on evolution might at first suggest\n**[survival of the fittest](https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letters/darwins-\nlife-letters/darwin-letters1866-survival-fittest)** required selfishness, he\nactually believed humans to be social beings seeking good.\n\nIn academic circles, researchers have been carrying out studies into the\npsychology and biology of kindness. Psychologists at the University of Sussex,\nfor example, published a [study](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/broadcast/read/46037)\nabout the \u2018warm glow\u2019 of kindness \u2013 with their findings based upon brain scans\nfrom some 1,000 people looking at what happens in the brain when they act out\nof genuine altruism and when there\u2019s nothing in it for them.\n\nA **[study](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_703807_en.html)**\nby the Universities of Exeter and Oxford found that taking part in self-\ncompassion exercises calms the heart rate and switches off the body's threat\nresponse. 135 Exeter students were divided into five groups, and members of\neach group heard a different set of audio instructions. The two groups whose\ninstructions encouraged them to be kind not only reported feeling more self-\ncompassion and connection with others, but also showed a bodily response\nconsistent with feelings of relaxation and safety.\n\nBack in 2015 geographer **[Danny Dorling](http://www.dannydorling.org/wp-\ncontent/files/dannydorling_publication_id5134.pdf)** drew upon multiple\nsources of evidence to try to understand the reasons why the UK had become one\nof the most unequal countries when ranked alongside 25 other countries. He\ndiscussed how behind every unequal policy there is a lack of empathy, and that\nonly kindness and respect will enable us to see each other as if we really are\n\u201call in this together\u201d.\n\nIn the United States last year UCLA established the **[Bedari Kindness\nInstitute](https://kindness.ucla.edu/)**. The Institute takes an\ninterdisciplinary approach to the study of kindness \u2013 looking at the\nevolutionary, psychological, economic, sociological, and other factors that\nfacilitate kind actions toward others. In developing its research programme\nthe Institute aims to translate its work into real-world practices and engage\nwith the public.\n\nIn everyday life kindness has come to the fore in the UK and around the world\nrecently - with acts of kindness and solidarity burgeoning amid Coronavirus\n(COVID-19): from a **[postcard](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-\ncornwall-51880695)** that you can drop off with neighbours who are self-\nisolating, offering your help with shopping or a friendly phone call; to\n**[supermarkets](https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/help-information/customer-\nservice/coronavirus)** designating certain hours for vulnerable shoppers or\nNHS staff and frontline workers; the **[clap for our\ncarers](https://clapforourcarers.co.uk/)** , the 750,000\n**[volunteers](https://www.goodsamapp.org/NHS)** signing up to support the 1.5\nmillion people asked to shield themselves for three-months and the countless\nrainbows we see displayed in windows. Of course, much of it has also been\ngoing on behind the closed doors of hospitals and homes, anonymously and\nunsung.\n\n###### **Where does kindness fit in public policy?**\n\nBack in 2017 **[The Carnegie UK\nTrust](https://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIh53L1r-z6AIVV4fVCh07hQ_xEAAYASAAEgIbn_D_BwE)**\ninvited **[Julia Unwin](http://www.juliaunwin.com/)** to explore kindness in\npublic policy through holding a series of roundtables discussions, polling\n5,000 people, and speaking at events and writing. In her\n**[report](https://www.carnegieuktrust.org.uk/news/julia-unwin-report-\nexamines-role-of-kindness-in-public-policy/)** , published in November 2018,\nUnwin argued that kindness, emotions and human relationships are a blind spot\nin public policy. She argued that kindness matters and makes a huge\ndifference: for without acts of kindness the \u2018state\u2019 and the \u2018market\u2019 would be\nincapable of functioning. Three drivers in public policy \u2013 (i) the\ntechnological power to manage information, (ii) the digital power to manage\ncommunication, and (iii) the economic force of austerity \u2013 have made it\nincreasingly important to look at the role of emotions, and kindness in public\npolicy. While policy makers are always engaging with emotional responses,\nfeelings and relationships; kindness itself tends not to feature in public\npolicy. Unwin\u2019s work on kindness suggests it matters for those developing,\nmanaging and accessing services: _\u201caction on kindness in communities must be\nmet by a new contract\u2026a contract that recognises that public services are\nalways about relationships and emotions. A contract that is written in the two\nlexicons of public service [rational and relational] and helps us all to be\nmore bilingual. A contract that will build trust in public services, encourage\nengagement and make social change possible\u201d._\n\nUnwin\u2019s work has stimulated further debate in this area. In September 2019\nSimon Anderson and Julie Brownlie from the University of Edinburgh queried if\nkindness was a concept belonging in, or having much to say to, the realm of\npublic policy \u2013 as part of discussions around how to enable and sustain what\nthey called an \u2018infrastructure of kindness\u2019. Their\n**[report](https://d1ssu070pg2v9i.cloudfront.net/pex/carnegie_uk_trust/2019/10/08105859/Public-\nPolicy-and-the-Infrastructure-of-Kindness-in-Scotland-Final-website-.pdf)**\nunpacks the conversations within policy and research circles in Scotland about\nhow and why kindness has emerged as a focus for policy. Anderson and Brownlie\ndescribe how the National Performance Framework (\n**[NPF](https://www.gov.scot/publications/launch-of-national-performance-\nframework-2018/)** ) has an _internal focus_ in creating the conditions in\nwhich acts and relationships of kindness can flourish within organisations;\nand an _external focus_ in creating the conditions in which acts and\nrelationships of kindness can flourish between individuals in community\nsettings. The NPF already signals a new approach being taken by civil servants\nand politicians \u2013 the national outcomes for **[children and young\npeople](https://nationalperformance.gov.scot/national-outcomes/children-and-\nyoung-people)** , for example, sets out a challenge to not only ensure that\nyoung people grow up with equal opportunities, but also that they \u2018feel loved,\nsafe, and respected\u2019.\n\nIn Wales, the **[Well-being of Future Generations\nAct](https://futuregenerations.wales/about-us/future-generations-act/)**\nrequires public bodies to consider the long-term impact of their decisions, to\nwork better with people, communities and each other, and to prevent persistent\nproblems such as poverty, health inequalities and climate change. The _**[art\nof the possible](https://futuregenerations.wales/the-art-of-the-possible/)**_\nprogramme is intended to make the Act \u2018real\u2019 by challenging \u2018business as\nusual\u2019 to create public services that meet the needs of current and future\ngenerations. A **[Healthier\nWales](https://futuregenerations.wales/a-healthier-wales/)** , for example,\ndescribes _\u2018a society in which people\u2019s physical and mental well-being is\nmaximised and in which choices and behaviours that benefit future health are\nunderstood\u2019_ \u2013 it further describes a need to _\u2018support people to act with\ncompassion.\u2019_\n\nOutside the UK, in a\n**[speech](https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/09/1021182)** at the United\nNations General Assembly in September 2018 New Zealand\u2019s Prime Minister\nJacinda Ardern called for kindness and collectivism as an alternative to\nisolationism, protectionism and racism. Since then the New Zealand Government\nhas implemented a **[family tax\npackage](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2017-12/Families%20Package%20Factsheet.pdf)**\naimed at reducing the number of children living in poverty by 41% by 2021 and\nintroduced a **[Child Poverty Reduction\nAct](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2018/0057/18.0/LMS8294.html)**\nwhich contains further child poverty reduction measures. In his 2018\n**[Christmas message](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/read-prime-minister-\njustin-trudeau-s-christmas-message-1.4230076)** the Canadian Prime Minister\nJustin Trudeau talked about _\u201cspreading kindness and light to each other\u201d_.\n\nBack in the UK, on the 31 March 2020 the think tank Compass held an **[online\nevent](https://www.compassonline.org.uk/events/the-ethics-and-emotions-of-the-\ncoronavirus-emergency/)** on \u2018the ethics and emotions of the Coronavirus\nemergency.\u2019 This looked at how the pandemic is forcing us to think and behave\ndifferently: how do we relate to each other socially and politically now? What\nare the right emotions and tone to adopt?\n\nMany of these policy research discussions and dialogues have emerged as a\nresult of seeing limits to the welfare state (be it a crisis in health care or\nchild poverty); or global issues such as COVID-19, climate change or\nmigration; and/or in response to populist political leaders. All of this is\nleading to reflections on if and where kindness, empathy and compassion fit\ninto public policy.\n\n###### **Where does kindness fit into policy interventions?**\n\nThe civil service **[competency\nframework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-\ncompetency-framework)** sets out 10 competencies grouped into three areas\n(setting direction, engaging people, and achieving results) to indicate how\ncivil servants are expected to work. From a HR perspective the framework is\nintended to be used for recruitment, performance management and staff\ndevelopment discussions and progression. Similarly, the **[capabilities\nplan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-capabilities-\nplan)** for the civil service identified four priority areas for future\ndevelopment: (i) leading and managing change, (ii) commercial skills and\nbehaviour, (iii) delivering successful projects and programmes, and (iv)\nredesigning services and delivering them digitally. Holders of public office\nshould act in accordance with the **[7\nprincipals](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-\npublic-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2)** of public life:\nselflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and\nleadership. While it is important that civil servants adhere to these\nframeworks and codes, does kindness require a behavioural shift that is not\nexplicit in these existing documents? A shift that would lead towards more\n_open and collaborative working_ \u2013 including a long term commitment from\nnational and local policy and decision makers to understand, support, reflect\nand invest in organisations and communities?\n\nKindness could bring civil servants _closer to communities_ \u2013 by being\naccessible and listening to what people are saying, including the voices of\npeople who are not traditionally heard.\n**[Research](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/Policy%20making%20in%20the%20real%20world.pdf)**\nhas looked at repeated efforts to rationalise policy through processes,\nqualities, structures and politics. This can lead policy to be seen as\nresponding to problems rather than identifying issues before they become\nproblems in need of intervention. In business, for example, there is often a\nquality control process whereby any new products are trialled and stress-\ntested before they reach the marketplace. Policy makers can find it difficult\nto adapt to local and changing circumstances (i.e., they often focus on making\nthings happen systematically). We also need a greater awareness of, and be\nable to measure, the intended and unintended effects of the implementation of\npolicy (i.e., will the intervention\n**[disadvantage](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rural-proofing)**\nsome rural communities?).\n\nKindness could open up a new dialogue about where, how and why policy makers\nshould _**invest**_. At a macro level some of us spend time looking at the\nproduction, distribution, consumption and trade of goods and services and yet\nless time understanding the role rural residents and community organisations\nplay in reducing isolation, loneliness and demand on acute health services and\nsocial care. Can we _measure what we value_ \u2013 such as the value of\nbefriending, improved mental health or savings from joint working? The\nScottish Household Survey (\n**[SHS](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-household-survey-key-\nfindings-2018/)** ), for example, contains questions asking respondents about\npeople who are kind and trusted in their neighbourhoods; other public bodies\nare using **[social value tools](https://socialvalueengine.com/)** to measure\nthe wider benefits and outcomes of their interventions.\n\nUnderstandably, some commentators query if kindness should inform policy and\ndecision making at all. They cite the need to ensure _fairness, openness,\nclarity and transparency_. **[Steven\nPinker](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/steven-pinker)** , a\npsychologist at Harvard University, describes our natural tendency to\nempathise more with our friends and relatives than with strangers \u2013 and he\nsuggests that no amount of training can erase this difference. Similarly, we\ncan focus on the \u2018warm glow\u2019 we get from being kind rather than thinking\nthrough whether it will deliver positive results (i.e., what are the upstream\nand downstream consequences? Does being kind lead us to focus on \u2018us feeling\ngood\u2019 rather than implementing initiatives that actually \u2018make people\u2019s lives\nbetter?\u2019?) Some commentators question how kindness fits into evidence based\npolicy ( **[EBP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_policy)** ) in\nwanting to apply scientific standards of proof?\n\nNowhere is this discussion more illuminated than in health. NHS England\u2019s\n**[Evidence Based Intervention Programme](https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/ebi-statutory-guidance-v2.pdf)** examined how to avoid\nvariations in clinical interventions. And yet in \u2018the **[Language of\nKindness,\u2019](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Language-Kindness-Nurses-\nStory/dp/1784741973)** former nurse Christie Watson explains how when she\nstarted her career some 20-years ago she thought of nursing as a combination\nof chemistry, biology, physics, pharmacology and anatomy, but gradually\nrealised it to be much more about philosophy, psychology, art, ethics and\npolitics. Similarly, the **[mum\ntest](https://www.cqc.org.uk/news/releases/making-mum-test-real-cqc-sets-out-\nits-new-model-inspecting-adult-social-care)** developed by the Care Quality\nCommission (CQC) seeks to personalise the inspection regime \u2013 by asking if the\nservice is \u2018caring\u2019 the CQC explores whether staff \u2018involve and treat everyone\nwith compassion, kindness, dignity and respect.\u2019 Here the balance between\nscientific\u2013technical and psychosocial elements of patient care [a\n**[biomedical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_model)** of\nmedicine] and the humanisation of medical care [having empathy, compassion and\nbeing kind and sympathetic] come to the fore. In the United States, for\nexample, physician-scientists Stephen Trzeciak and Anthony Mazzarelli have\nhighlighted what they refer to as the systemic inhumanity within \u201cpatient-\nbased\u201d medicine. Referring to a **[\u201ccompassion\ncrisis\u201d](https://www.compassionomics.com/)** in US health care; they argue\nthat treating patients more kindly would improve health outcomes, reduce\ndoctor burnout and reduce costs.\n\n###### **What makes a (rural) community kinder?**\n\nThe Carnegie UK Trust and Joseph Rowntree Foundation have compiled\n**[evidence](https://d1ssu070pg2v9i.cloudfront.net/pex/carnegie_uk_trust/2017/07/LOW-\nRES-3110-Kindness-Overcoming-Risk-Report.pdf)** and undertaken action research\nwith communities on kindness. They view kindness as important in both reducing\nsocial isolation, tackling loneliness and improving wellbeing; and in\nproviding the building blocks for community empowerment through positive\nrelationships and values. They have highlighted three factors that contribute\nto kinder communities: (1) _welcoming places_ \u2013 by this they mean places that\nare free to use, have warm hospitality and are free from any agendas. (2)\n_Informal opportunities_ \u2013 creating opportunities to connect and act in\nkindness. (3) _Values of kindness_ \u2013 being kind to you, trusting people and\ncelebrating kindness. Linked to these themes they suggest three actions lead\nto kinder communities: (i) _thinking and talking about kindness to encourage\nus all to be kinder_ , (ii) leaders _empowering people to act in kindness_\n(particularly leaders of organisations that provide services), and (iii)\nGovernment _removing barriers to kindness_.\n\nIn July 2019 the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG)\nset out its\n**[vision](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/819477/MHCLG_Communities_Framework_Accessible.pdf)**\nfor **[stronger local\ncommunities](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/brokenshire-unveils-new-plan-\nfor-building-stronger-communities)** \u2013 what they look like and what Government\nand local partners can do to support them. The vision focuses on four areas:\n(i) trust, connectedness and local pride; (ii) active citizenship and local\ncontrol; (iii) shared community spaces; and (iv) shared prosperity. Building\non activity taking place across departments, Government intends to hold\nconversations with communities across the country, establish Civic Deal pilots\nand publish a Communities White Paper. According to MHCLG stronger communities\nare built on _people, place and pride_ and lead to improvements in health and\nwellbeing, local services, economic growth, decision making and the\nenvironment. The vision cites the **[Ennerdale\nHub](https://thegatherennerdale.com/)** in Cumbria as an example of a strong\ncommunity. Here residents came together to form a cooperative to develop and\nrun \u2018The Gather\u2019, a community centre, shop, caf\u00e9, exhibition and event space\nin the heart of the village. The Hub developed this facility for the local\ncommunity in response to the reduction and withdrawal of services in the area.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2015 the **[RSA](https://www.thersa.org/)** worked with the\nUniversity of Central Lancashire and London School of Economics to carry out\n**[research](https://www.thersa.org/action-and-research/rsa-projects/public-\nservices-and-communities-folder/connected-communities-social-inclusion-and-\nmental-wellbeing)** in seven neighbourhoods across England on **[connected\ncommunities](https://www.thersa.org/action-and-research/rsa-projects/public-\nservices-and-communities-folder/connected-communities-social-inclusion-and-\nmental-wellbeing/about)**. This longitudinal project focused on how\ncommunities can support themselves [where people are embedded within networks\nof social support in which people experience reduced social isolation and\ngreater wellbeing] in ways that reduce pressure on public services. They\nargued that by investing in interventions that build and strengthen networks\n**[4 types of divided](https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-\narticles/reports/community-capital-the-value-of-connected-communities)** will\nbe shared by people in the community: a wellbeing dividend, a citizenship\ndividend, a capacity dividend and an economic dividend.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a non-profit organisation, national charity or Government\ndepartment, what does all of this work mean for rural communities? I offer\nthree points.\n\n  1. _People:_ rural residents do things intuitively every day for others in their local community that are either taken for granted or that we rarely take the time to reflect upon (e.g. dropping a prescription off, providing a lift to get somewhere or checking in on a vulnerable resident). Existing work on kindness, connectedness and strength tends to focus upon individuals or community organisations (looking upwards or downwards) rather than at a whole community level (within). Who is doing what, when and why \u2013 and how might we encourage more people [living in rural and urban areas] to adapt some of these practices?\n  2. _Place:_ RSN readers are well-rehearsed in the innovative ways that rural communities seek to overcome access to services difficulties \u2013 we are used to getting by with less in rural areas compared to our urban counterparts. In being kind to each other in rural communities do we reduce demand on public services? (E.g. we may notice when a vulnerable person we visit is deteriorating and support them to access help sooner so they do not present in crisis; we pick up the prescription to help a neighbour get and stay well). This opens up an important dialogue about ensuring policy makers do not leave rural communities to \u2018get on with it\u2019 [i.e., where services might be reduced or withdrawn] or that they seek to absorb what we do into their system with its strategies and processes. We need the relationship between rural communities and policy makers to be \u2018bilingual\u2019, can kindness build and strengthen links between rural communities and policymakers? \n  3. _Outcomes:_ there are clearly societal benefits that come from acts of kindness (e.g. reduction in isolation and loneliness, improved health and wellbeing etc.) but we often find it difficult to identify, describe, quantify and measure these. In many instances we have not collated data or used it as part of an evidence base to make the case for investing in rural communities. \n\nFor me kindness is not grand, rather it is found in small everyday acts,\nsomething that you do for another unselfishly but from which your personal\ngain can also be unavoidable. While talking about kindness in a professional\ncontext has not always sat comfortably with many of us, amid COVID-19 it has\nbrought it to the fore and for many of us offered warmth and support at a time\nof great need. How can we ensure the kindness displayed amid this tragic\nglobal pandemic continues and informs whatever our \u2018new normal\u2019 ways of\nworking will be? How can we continue to talk about kindness in our work, in\nour lives and in our rural communities?\n\n![](/images/RoseSmall.png)_Jessica is a researcher/project manager at Rose\nRegeneration.

Technology governs our work as well and demands that we stay\nready to adapt with agility and intelligence. With so much around us in a\nstate of constant flux, Human Capital Management (HCM) warrants a deeper\nunderstanding.\n\n## **1\\. What is Human Capital Management?**\n\nHuman Capital Management (HCM) is defined as a set of practices for human\nresource management, with the goal of achieving organizational competency for\nworkforce acquisition, management and optimization.\n\nBefore we delve deeper into HCM processes, features and strategies, let\u2019s take\na moment to focus on the key elements of the definition.\n\n**First** , HCM is not mere theories and rules \u2013 but rather a \u201cset of\npractices\u201d. The practical aspect of HCM is important because it points to the\nfact that in order to be practical, these systems need to stay relevant.\n\n**Second** , HCM is \u201cfocused on the organizational need\u201d. What might be\nperfect for organization A might be a completely wrong fit for organization B.\nThe point to be noted here is that while we are often bombarded with best\npractices for doing everything, the best practice to start with is often to\nstep away from the herd and find the best fit.\n\n**Third** , under the HCM canopy, we need to find the right competencies to\nfocus on with regard to \u201cworkforce acquisition, workforce management, and\nworkforce optimization\u201d. While the use of \u201cworkforce\u201d may seem a little dated\nin today\u2019s WoW (World of Work) of \u201ctalent\u201d speak, the definition does capture\nthe essence of HCM. Having said that, the practices under HCM need to evolve\nto keep pace with our growing relationship with technology.\n\nToday there are multiple HCM suite solutions available in the market. For\nexample, multi-feature, comprehensive suite offerings by Workday, SAP, Oracle,\nPeopleSoft, BambooHR, Zoho People and many other players offer such a wide\nvariety of solutions that it leads to a decision dilemma in assessing what\nwould really work for a particular organization.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is HRIS? System, Model and\nApplication**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)\n\n## **2\\. The 3 core aspects of Human Capital Management (HCM)**\n\nHuman Capital Management covers a wide spectrum of talent acquisition and\nmanagement processes throughout the employee life cycle. To understand better,\nlet\u2019s divide the whole spectrum into three broad functionalities \u2013 **(A)\nTalent Acquisition (TA), (B) Talent Management and (C) Talent Optimization** \u2013\nand deep dive into the nuances within each of these categories.\n\n### **Talent Acquisition**\n\n  \nIt\u2019s always best to start at the beginning - where the employee life cycle\ncommences. To be precise though, it actually starts just before the TA\nprocesses with Talent Gap Analysis. Predictive workforce planning tools like\nSAP HR Analytics and Oracle HCM Cloud take into consideration the current\ntalent spread, the immediate talent requirements and business strategies to\nmap future requirements based on a holistic analysis.\n\nA comprehensive TA-centric Human Capital Management system needs to cater to\nthe needs of the primary TA process:\n\n  1. **[Recruitment/ eRecruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-recruitment/) \\- **This includes sourcing, screening, qualifying, and skill-matching\n  2. [**ATS (Application Tracking System)**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-applicant-tracking-systems/)\n  3. **[Onboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) \\- **background checks, joining formalities, orientation, and a 30-60-90 day growth plan to get the new recruit started.\n\n  \nSolutions like SuccessFactors, SilkRoad Life Suite, Taleo (Oracle talent\ncloud), ClearCompany HRM and TribeHR offer tools that focus on gaining access\nto and acquiring the right talent. Finding the right match in today\u2019s\nimpatient and volatile environment is as difficult as it is necessary. An\nefficient ATS, for example, not only makes the job of the smart recruiter\neasier, but also improves the candidate experience. Recruitment being the\nfirst engagement between an organization and a prospective employee, it\nmatters how well the system is managed.\n\nWhile smart recruitment algorithms and recruiting chatbots have made the\ninitial stages of sourcing and screening a lot easier, a comprehensive end-to-\nend TA HCM solution needs to deliver more than that. It needs to be able to\nhelp the TA manager with the processes of qualifying r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, scheduling\ninterviews and skillset-matching while helping to collect and store data for\nbackground checks, carry out joining processes and also helping chart out a\ngrowth plan for the first three months for the new joinee. A 30-60-90day plan\nnot only lends more credibility to the need for a particular talent bust also\nprovides the newbie with a business-goals-centric plan to get started during\nthe first three crucial months.\n\nHuman Capital Management suites can also make the first day at work a lot\nsmoother and a lot less daunting with conversational bots to guide the way and\nhelp in a preliminary orientation to software, processes and organizational\ncharts.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What Is Talent Acquisition? Definition, Process,\nStrategies, and Best\nPractices**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-acquisition/)\n\n### **Talent Management**\n\n  \nThe nature of talent that present-day organizations have to manage has changed\nmore in the last decade than it had changed over the 30 years before that.\nWork is no longer a place but a function with teams dispersed across\ncontinents, freelancers pitching in and increasingly flexible work-hours.\nHuman Capital Management systems need to be aware of and conscious about these\nnew tweaks to the work ecosystem. Keeping that in mind, here are the must-have\nfeatures for a talent management HCM system:\n\n**1.** **Time and attendance**\n\n  * Leaves and Absence management\n  * Self-service application and tracking systems\n  * Biometrics and security\n\n  \nWith an increase in remote workers, freelancers and globally dispersed teams,\nmapping time and attendance while also maintaining security needs is crucial.\nTools like TimeAttend and CeiPal Workforce make it easier to track and manage\non-the-job timings, leave applications and security requirements. Moreover,\nHCM tools enable self-service by allowing employees to manage their data\nthemselves thus creating greater transparency and improved engagement.\n\n**2.** **Payroll**\n\n  * Compensation mapping\n  * Remuneration tracking and roll-out\n  * Compensation planning for gig workers\n\n  \nWhile the focus has been growing on the non-monetary aspects at work,\ncompensation and benefits would always remain a key motivator. No matter how\nhard we try to eliminate the transactional nature of jobs, at the end of the\nday, while the paycheck is not the only thing that matters, it surely matters\na lot. Using Human Capital Management tools to manage payroll has been in\npractice for quite a few years now since it is one of the easier things to\nautomate. AI-enabled payroll HCM like Zenefits and RUN help in mapping\nindustry trends to benchmark compensation plans for the different sets of\nworkers from full-time on-location to remote gig-workers.\n\n**3.** **Performance management**\n\n  * Goal-alignment\n  * Task-tracking\n  * Internal communication and team planning\n\nHCM systems encourage and enable better communication. These mechanisms allow\nanytime-anywhere access, help in planning goals, aligning individuals and\nteams on the relevant business objectives and also allow 360 degree task-\ntracking. With tools like Performly, AssessTEAM, PerformancePro and BirdDogHR,\norganizations can boost productivity in ways that are more congenial to\nemployees.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Performance\nManagement?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)\n\n**4.** **Culture connect**\n\n  * Rewards and recognition\n  * Grievance addressal and redressal systems\n  * Weaving ethics into the system\n\n  \nWhat employees do at work everyday makes up the culture of the organization.\nWith tools like Globoforce and TinyPulse, organizations can build a branded\nculture of ethical behavior, recognition, gratitude and engagement. Moreover,\nwith Human Capital Management software, the culture can be translated to every\nemployee in all the functions that they serve and all the processes that they\nare a part of.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Talent Management? Definition, Strategy, Process\nand Model**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/)\n\n### **Talent Optimization**\n\n  \nThe journey does not end with finding the right talent \u2013 it begins from there.\nIn that journey there can be no room for stagnation. Organizations need to\nconstantly try to create avenues for talent optimization \u2013 for individual and\ncollective growth, without turning on business goals and objectives. You need\nto future-proof your employees. Here are four ways in which the right HCM can\nenable that:\n\n  1. Career-pathing\n  2. Competency mapping\n  3. Succession planning\n  4. Learning and development\n\nWith a tailored HCM solution, organizations can not only train their employees\non immediate skill needs but also for the skill requirements of the future.\nCoursera, for example enables skills benchmarking with the use of AI\n(Artificial Intelligence). With efficient cloud-backed, data-driven HCM\nsystems, organizational leaders can make the right career-pathing decisions in\nadvance thus providing both the organization and the individual a map to\nfollow. Succession planning has been proven to a great way to optimize HiPos\nand the right HCM tools can help in decisions regarding the same by studying\ngallons of data. Tools like SuccessFactors HCM by SAP encourage diverse teams\nto collaborate better and optimize on the positives of having a team of very\ndifferent individuals.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is People Management? Complete Process with Best\nPractices**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-people-management/)\n\n## **3\\. The Right HCM Solution: Finding the \u201cSuite\u201d Spot**\n\nLike we stated in the beginning, when it comes to choosing an HCM suite, best-\nfit matters more than best practices.\n\nHere are some key considerations and questions when choosing the right HCM\nsolution\n\n### **1.** **Why do we need an HCM system?**\n\n  \nYou need to know what are the areas that need greater intervention, what are\nthe reasons that some processes have been difficult or stalled and what you\nwish you achieve with the investment in a new tool-system.\n\n### **2.** **What are the must-have and nice-to-have features we want?**\n\n  \nThe MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have this time) priority\nlist is a great start for any decision. You need to be able to answer what the\nHCM solution must do, should do, could do and also what it would do in the\nfuture.\n\n### **3.** **Present budget v/s growth needs?**\n\n  \nTo answer this, you might first have to identify where in the spectrum you\nfall. Are you an SMB (small and medium business) with less than 1000\nemployees, an MM (mid-market) player with an employee strength between\n1000-5000, an enterprise with over 5000 employees, a well-established MNC with\nover 10000 employees or are you a cusp organization transitioning between\nthese segregations? Based on where you fall in the spectrum and where you are\nheaded, you need to choose a solution that caters to your immediate needs but\nthat is also dynamic enough to incorporate your future needs. Your budget\nwould differ accordingly.\n\n### **4.** **What is the level of customization you require?**\n\n  \nThere are multiple HCM suite players in the market today that offer need-based\nplans. Most basic plans do not allow for customization but you need to be\nclear about what customizations you would need.\n\n### **5.** **Are you ready to adapt?**\n\n  \nBefore you build your case for investing in a new or upgraded HCM solution,\nask yourself whether your organization is ready for the change. There is often\nthe need for training with the introduction of any new tool and employees need\nto be allowed some teething time as well. The organization must be willing and\ncapable of letting employees and HR adapt to the change.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **HRIS vs. HCM: What's the\nDifference?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/hris-vs-hcm-whats-the-difference/)\n\n## **The 5 Big HCM Trends for 2020**\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse into the future and the five key trends that would shape up\nthe HCM space in the years to come:\n\n### **1\\. An end to worries about job-stealing-AI**\n\n  \nContrary to the \u201cAI Apocalypse\u201d narrative, recent studies point out that 93%\nof people are willing to take orders from a robot and 70% of employees are\nalready using some form of AI in their personal lives. By 2020, with this\nmentality seeping into work culture, employees would become a lot less fearful\nand a lot more adaptive to AI.\n\nThis would lead to greater, more effective human-AI collaboration in the\nsuper-job era, and better rationalization of high-value jobs and roles for\nhumans. It also means that HCM systems need to be set up to manage all kinds\nof \u2018employees\u2019 - human and non-human.\n\n### **2\\. AI will no longer be optional**\n\nAccording to a recent study by Oracle, 79% of HR leaders believe that failure\nto adopt AI will have a negative impact on their overall organization;\nhowever, only 6% of HR professionals are actively deploying AI solutions.\nRealizing this discrepancy will push more companies than ever \u2013 including\nthose that have traditionally been hesitant \u2013 to embrace artificially\nintelligent solutions.\n\nWhile more involvement and encouragement from the HR to create an AI-enabled\nwork culture would be ideal, the fact is that many HR teams are still\nstruggling with basic digital transformation and automation challenges. A\nstep-change approach is needed to ensure the drastic transformation - and your\nsystems need to be able to support this transformation with agility and scale.\n\n### **3\\. HR to lead the predictive analytics movement**\n\n  \nWhile many think of HR as a \u201csoft\u201d skill, the future of this industry is built\non the use of predictive analytics to make intelligent employee decisions. A\nrecent survey by HBR shows that 31% of HR professionals are already using AI-\nbacked data analysis to identify at-risk talent, source best-fit candidates\nvia resume analysis, and predict high-performing recruits. In 2020, I expect\nthis number to jump much higher.\n\nSmarter decisions backed by data and powered by predictive tools are on the\ncards, but what new skills do HR leaders need on their teams to ensure they\ncan make the most of these smart decision-making tools? What new workflows\nneed to be defined, designed and automated to ensure these smarter methods of\ntalent acquisition and employee retention are executed flawlessly\n\n### **4\\. Digital assistants will become \u201cco-workers\u201d**\n\n  \nDigital assistants, accessible through voice or SMS, work 24/7 and can provide\nnearly-instant, tailored responses on simple tasks like vacation balance and\nexpense approval to complicated subjects like taxes and benefits. Over time,\nthe digital assistants can even take on more sophisticated personas such as\nmentors, coaches or counselors.\n\nThe need to understand generational diversity at work better and in ways that\nare more actionable will be strategic to organizational success. Smart HCM\nSystems will create a seamless employee experience for everything from\nefficient and effective employee onboarding; day-to-day time-consuming tasks\nlike expense reporting; and career-defining initiatives such as coaching with\nreal-time, always-on systems that employees can access at their convenience\n\n### **5\\. Smarter, mobile recruitment**\n\n  \nWith the human attention span averaging just 8 seconds and the unemployment\nrate at its lowest in 50 years, applying for jobs needs to be easy and able to\nbe done on-the-go. Moving into 2020 and beyond, HR professionals will be\nforced to adapt their recruiting techniques to this new norm or risk losing\nquality talent to competitors.\n\nOrganizations need to create their employer brand based on candidate\nexpectations, technology trends, and the changing business environment. The\n\u2018last mile\u2019 between the job opportunity ad the potential candidate is a\ncrucial and vulnerable link - using technology to close that gap at the last\nmile with speed, accuracy and as per process is going to be central.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Top 5 Human Capital Management (HCM) Software Features for\n2019**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/top-hcm-software-features/)\n\n## **Handle Change Meaningfully**\n\nIn conclusion, what needs to be kept in mind is that the right HCM solution\ncan prove to be a lot more than a system that simply manages data and\nprocesses better. It can be a tool to motivate your employees, to engage them\norganically and to provide an augmented employee experience through the\nduration of their employment or even career. That said, how well a Human\nCapital Management system functions within an organization depends on how well\nyou use it and how motivated your employees feel to adapt to the upgrade. In\nthe end, it\u2019s all about how you, the HR manager can HCM - handle change\nmeaningfully!\n\n**_Are you happy with the HCM system you use?

A competency model is a set of competencies that\ncollectively define the requirements for effective performance in a specific\njob, profession or organization, such as HR.\n\nThe Society for Human Resource Management defines competencies as either\ntechnical or behavioral and says that \u201ctechnical competencies reflect the\nknowledge required to perform a specific role,\u201d while \u201cbehavioral competencies\ndescribe the KSAs that facilitate the application of technical knowledge to\njob-related behavior.\u201d In other words, technical competencies reflect the\nknowledge HR professionals apply to their jobs, and behavioral competencies\nreflect how HR professionals apply this knowledge.\n\nIn his SHRM Online article [Certify This! The Role of Competency-Based\nCertification in HR](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-\nforecasting/special-reports-and-expert-views/pages/alex-alonso.aspx),\nAlexander Alonso stresses the importance of [competency-based\ncertification](https://www.shrm.org/learningandcareer/career/pages/shrm-\ncompetency-model.aspx) for HR professionals:\n\n\u201cFor years, HR professionals have been told that we are not part of the\nbusiness family. This assertion is all wrong, and a close examination of\ncompetencies across various business disciplines, including HR, illustrates\ntheir connective tissue. The DNA of HR professionals is only distinct from\nother disciplines in its technical genome and the relative importance of key\nbehavioral elements. The evidence base suggests HR professionals are not\ndeveloped and certified the same way other professionals are.\n\nThe time for change is now as advancements in measurement, testing and\nperformance appraisal make selecting, training and certifying HR professionals\non more than technical knowledge a reality. Only selection instruments,\nperformance management tools, training programs and certifications using a\ndual-emphasis competency-based approach will succeed in elevating the HR\nprofession. Organizational success is depending on it.\u201d\n\nTo function effectively, HR professionals must master specific concepts and\ncompetencies and be able to apply that knowledge to specific business\nsituations and settings.\n\nThe [future of HR is\nhere](https://www.shrm.org/certification/Documents/16-0078_Certification_Infographics.pdf),\nand earning your SHRM-CP or SHRM-SCP credential, based on the SHRM Body of\nCompetency and Knowledge\u2122 (SHRM BoCK\u2122), makes you a recognized expert and\nleader in the HR field and a valuable asset to your organization\u2014keeping you\nand your organization competitive in today's economy. This professional\ndistinction sets you apart from your colleagues, proving your high level of\nknowledge and skills.\n\nHow do you view the role of competencies in HR? How will they define and\ndirect the success of HR professionals?\n\nPlease join [@shrmnextchat](http://@SHRMnextchat) at 3 p.m. ET on July 31 for\n#Nextchat with special guest Alex Alonso\n([@SHRM_CKO](https://twitter.com/SHRM_CKO)), SHRM chief knowledge officer,\nresearcher, credentialing expert and author of The Price of Pettiness.

Making a group of people work hard for desired outcomes has\nbeen the objective of every business organization. Historical accounts trace\nthese concerns, predominantly, from the first World War. Let us take a quick\nlook at how people and human management practices have evolved in the last\ncentury by touching upon some of the most important milestones.\n\nFour prominent scientific management principles by Frederick Winslow Taylor,\nfather of the scientific management, proposed that by optimizing and\nsimplifying jobs, productivity would increase. An era of rationality-based\npeople management started during the early 1900s, by questioning \u2018Rule of\nthumb,\u2019 and a need for harmony vs. discord and cooperation, instead of\nindividualism was postulated. \u2018Mental revolution\u2019 and focus on the\ndevelopmental needs of employees for efficiency and prosperity were advocated.\n\nElton Mayo's contribution (during the 1920s) to management theory helped pave\nthe way for modern human relations management methods. Mayo management theory\nstated that employees are motivated far more by relational factors such as\nattention and camaraderie than by monetary rewards or environmental factors\nsuch as lighting, humidity, etc. As cited in the literature, \u2018Industrial\nwelfare\u2019 included regulation of work hours and inclusion of women in the\nworkforce, etc. During World War II, the focus was on recruitment and\nselection and later on training, improving morale and motivation, discipline,\nhealth and safety, joint consultation and wage policies, and a beginning of a\n\u2018personnel department.\u2019 A focus on \u2018effectiveness,\u2019 \u2018doing things right,\u2019 and\n\u2018efficiency,\u2019 i.e., \u2018doing the right things,\u2019 meant that people management\ninterventions include employee\u2019s behavior at work in addition to the desired\noutcome. Personal departments emerged into \u2018Human Resources Management (HRM),\nand interventions for \u2018Human Resource Development\u2019 (HRD) became a norm.\n\n\u2018Performance Excellence\u2019 was required for \u2018business excellence\u2019 in a\ncompetitive business environment and dominance of the service sector in a\nglobal world. Thus, discourses on \u2018Human Resource\u2019 as postulated by the\nscientific era shifted to \u2018Human Being.\u2019 People management interventions for\nperformance excellence mandated that organizations think about people's\nwellbeing and deploy them strategically aligning business needs with workforce\ncompetencies and capabilities. Peter Drucker\u2019s framework for \u2018Management by\nobjectives\u2019 (MBO) for alignment, HR Partner and HR champions for change by\nDave Ulrich and other scholars from the University of Michigan addressed the\nissue of strategic alignment for business excellence.\n\nInformation Technology (IT) resulted in another paradigm shift for people\nmanagement interventions towards the end of the last century. IT helped HR\nmanagers offload routine tasks and give them more time to solve complex\nproblems. IT solutions also ensured that a greater amount of information was\nmade available to make decisions. The use of the internet and a shift to a\n24/7 society, new jobs in e-commerce are using new modes of recruitment,\ne-recruitment, use of social media and online training, led to the emergence\nof \u2018Humanistic Management.\u2019 This included modern concepts like \u2018flexibility\u2019,\n\u2018diversity,\u2019 \u2018part-time engagement\u2019 and \u2018temporary contracts\u2019, \u2018distance\nworking\u2019, and \u2018work from home\u2019.\n\nThe Project Oxygen team of \u2018Google\u2019 changed the discourse yet again. One-year\ndata-mining from employee documents (which recorded more than 10,000\nobservations of manager behavior) resulted in 400 pages of notes to identify\nstandard behavioral science methodologies and being a good coach became one of\nthe eight critical competencies. Empowerment instead of micromanagement,\nowning team member\u2019s success and wellbeing, and their career progression\nemerged as some essential people management interventions for performance\nexcellence. These behaviors had one thing in common: the role of a manager\nincludes a deep commitment to short- and long-term employee success.\n\nIn the end, it will be worth mentioning some of the current rhetoric being\nused by thought leaders in the area of HRM. These include, \u2018employee first,\ncustomer second,\u2019 \u2018building capability, not just compliance\u2019, focusing away\nfrom centers of expertise towards the \u2018employee experience,\u2019 the EACH model -\nEmployees as Adults, Consumers, and Human beings, and the SMAC model - Social,\nMobile, App and Cloud management of the workforce. The focus today is on\nunderstanding employee\u2019s strengths and the unique contribution they can make,\nfrom competency to strength-building and the conversation has shifted to\ncareer and learning, rather than performance reviews. Data-driven HR using\nmachine language (ML) & artificial intelligence (AI) is being discussed\nextensively and used by some businesses. Alongside, employee health and\nmorbidity concerns are being addressed, and a need for a compassionate\napproach for people management is being deliberated to create a better working\nenvironment that will benefit both employees and the companies\u2019 performance.\n\nExcellence is a journey and involves constant striving for improvement, and\ntherefore, performance excellence would need continuous conversations and\ninsights from both practitioners and researchers for more evolved people\nmanagement interventions.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Performance

Often enough, the phrase human\nresource management system (HRMS) is thrown into the alphabet soup as well.\nThis is a classic case of oversimplification leading to complications. These\nare not exactly the same things, though they deal with the cornerstone of\nevery organization \u2013 people. HRIS and HCM are both systematic approaches to\nmanage people better and to leverage the human potential of every\norganization. That said, their internal systems and processes have certain\ncardinal differences that cannot be overlooked._**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834b324a1a1.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n  * **What Is an HRIS?**\n  * **What Is HCM?**\n  * **HRIS vs. HCM: What's the Difference?**\n\n## **What Is an HRIS?**\n\n[Human resource information system\n(HRIS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/) can be defined as a software or online solution that is\nused for data entry, data tracking, and the data management of all human\nresources operations of an organization. An HRIS thus deals with all things\ndata and helps translate that to on-demand information and insights.\n\nThe six key HRIS systems and working components that most solutions offer are\nas follows:\n\n  * Database management\n  * Time and labor management\n  * Payroll functions\n  * Benefits management\n  * Employee interface\n  * Talent acquisition and retention\n\n  \n**Learn More:[What Is HRIS? System, Model, and\nApplication](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)**\n\n## **What Is HCM?**\n\nHuman capital management (HCM) is defined as a set of practices for human\nresource management with the goal of achieving organizational competency by\nfocusing on workforce acquisition, management, and optimization.\n\nToday, there are multiple HCM point and suite solutions available in a rather\ncrowded market. For example, multi-feature suite offerings by Workday, SAP,\nOracle, PeopleSoft, BambooHR, Zoho People and many other players offer a wide\nvariety of solutions.\n\nThe three pillars of human capital management are:\n\n### **1\\. Talent acquisition**\n\n  * Recruitment / eRecruitment\n  * ATS (application tracking system)\n  * Onboarding\n\n### **2\\. Talent management**\n\n  * Time and attendance\n  * Payroll\n  * Performance management\n  * Culture-building\n\n### **3\\. Talent optimization**\n\n  * Career pathing\n  * Competency mapping\n  * Succession planning\n  * Learning and development  \n\n**Learn More:[What is Human Capital Management (HCM)? Definition, Process and\nStrategy](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-human-capital-management/)**\n\n## **HRIS vs. HCM: What\u2019s the Difference?**\n\nThe primary difference between and HRIS and HCM suite solutions is that the\nHCM suite usually includes all the HRIS processes and systems under its\numbrella.\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 1. Comparing HRIS, HCM, and HRMS_**\n\n### **Does HCM have a wider scope?**\n\n  \nAs the figure below depicts, an HCM suite not only takes care of all HRIS sub-\nprocesses but also manages onboarding functions, **[performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)** , position mapping, and succession\nplanning, salary/compensation benchmarking, global connectivity, compliance\n(for geographically spread out organizations), and HR analytics.\n\nTo provide you with a holistic picture, we\u2019ve also included a depiction of\nwhere HRMS fits into the picture, or rather how HCM and HRIS both fit under\nthe broader umbrella of HRMS.\n\nMost HCM suites today are trying to incorporate payroll and labor management\nwithin their functionality and thus expanding their span of control to include\nHRMS offerings.\n\nWhat needs to be kept in mind while navigating this HR solutions market,\nespecially in an age of digital and data dependency, is that there are quite a\nfew talent management (TM) point solution vendors who often dub themselves HCM\nvendors to elevate their brand and to expand their clientele.\n\nWhether you choose an HRIS or an HCM suite depends on the talent management\ncapabilities you require and the extra functionalities that your people\nfunctions will benefit from. Moreover, time- and labor-centric point solutions\noften market their offerings as workforce management, but that is not the same\nas talent management.\n\n![HRIS Vs. HCM Vs. HRMS](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **Core features and capabilities**\n\n  \nThe core capabilities of HRIS and HCM solutions differ significantly. While an\nHRIS helps with recruiting, leave management, workflows, training, and\ndevelopment, benefits administration, self-service portals, compensation\nmanagement, and personnel tracking, there are often organizational needs that\ngo beyond the acquisition and management of data.\n\nCore HCM offerings, on the other hand, include all HRIS features along with\ntracking employee performance, [onboarding\nprocesses](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/), analytics (from all HRIS data)\nand workforce planning with regard to mapping the talent path ahead.\n\n**Learn More:[What is People Management? Complete Process with Best\nPractices](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-people-management/)**\n\n## **A Matter of Choice**\n\nThus, while it might often be confusing to choose the right solution, knowing\nthe difference between HRIS and HCM is a good start. That, followed by\nanalyzing your unique organizational needs, takes you closer to making the\nright choice. While choosing any HR software solution, keeping the following\nquestions in mind always help:\n\n  * What is my current and projected employee strength?\n  * What are the issues we face with our present HR processes or HR software?\n  * Where are the process gaps?\n  * How well are my employees equipped to adapt to a new or upgraded system?\n  * What are the limitations with regard to hosting all our existing data on the new system?\n  * How flexible is it and how easily can we upgrade or migrate to something different in the future?\n  * What are the potential challenges that we could face?\n  * What are the must-have, good-to-have, and great-to-have features based on our needs?\n\n  \n**Learn More:** **[Talent Acquisition Specialist: 10 Key Skill Requirements\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-specialist-key-skill-requirements/)**\n\nChoosing the right HR software is an important decision since every piece of\ndata helps you solve the larger people puzzle. Whether you go ahead with an\nHRIS or an HCM, your decision should be based on careful scrutiny of the\npresent scenario and your growth plans.\n\n_Do you use an HRIS or an HCM suite?

Taylor, Jr., SHRM-SCP. Just as importantly, Taylor told the roughly\n900 attendees at the 2019 SHRM Volunteer Leaders' Business Meeting this\nweekend, SHRM will continue to raise its profile with both federal and state\nlegislatures as well as among C-suite leaders to shape workplace policy.\n\n\"Only one group is prepared to be the voice of the future of work,\" Taylor\ntold the enthusiastic crowd on the last day of the meeting. SHRM chapter and\nstate council leaders traveled from across the country to advocate on Capitol\nHill, learn more about SHRM and get resources to help lead their\norganizations.\n\nSHRM will increase advertising on national television and online as part of\nthe strategy to amplify its voice, Taylor said. The recent TV commercials have\nshifted from spotlighting only HR to embracing business solutions\u2014like\nbuilding more-inclusive workplace cultures and closing the skills gap, a\nreflection of the expanded role SHRM is taking on the national stage.\n\nTaylor noted that when the CEO of McDonald's was fired for having a\nrelationship with a colleague, reporters from CNN, the _Financial Times_ and\nother media organizations called SHRM for comment. \"We have become the trusted\nsource,\" he said.\n\nSHRM has been on a roll. It now has 310,000 members, a nearly 9 percent jump\nfrom two years ago. Revenue will hit a record $168.4 million this year.\n\nNext year, SHRM will continue its effort to aid companies in hiring people\noften overlooked in the job market. This year, SHRM has stressed the\nimportance of hiring the formerly incarcerated and offered tools to guide\ncompanies through that process.\n\nLast month, the SHRM Foundation launched the [Employing\nAbilities@Work](https://employingabilities.org/) initiative to boost\nemployment of individuals with disabilities. That will continue in 2020.\nTaylor said the new year will also bring a program to fight the blatant ageism\nthat's evident any time employers talk about their desire to hire bright,\nyoung workers\u2014thus overlooking older individuals, despite the likelihood that\nolder workers will remain the workplace longer.\n\n\"Ninety-year-olds are going to be needing career development,\" he joked.\n\nNext year, SHRM will launch a new People Manager Qualification (PMQ), an\nevidence-based learning program for working professionals who have their first\njob supervising employees or need to improve their skills. He said HR\nprofessionals can better concentrate on driving business results if they\naren't continuously having to solve issues that should be settled by managers.\n\nThe idea of a PMQ drew praise from conference attendees. Many said that\ncompanies often promote people to become managers because they excelled at\ntheir day-to-day job without considering their temperament or people skills.\nThose shortcomings are often compounded by a lack of training.\n\n\"So many managers don't know how to manage,\" said Sherry Cooke, a human\nresources consultant. She believes the PMQ will be especially helpful for\nsmaller employers that don't have the time or budget for extensive in-house\ntraining. \"They are usually just so focused on making money,\" she said.\n\nTaylor also addressed the heated presidential election, which is already\ncausing significant tension in the workplace. HR must play a role in\nmaintaining a civil culture, he said.\n\nAccording to research SHRM released earlier this month, [nearly half of survey\nrespondents have had a disagreement in the workplace over\npolitics](/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-relations/pages/political-\ndiscord-is-disrupting-the-workplace.aspx). A third said that their workplace\nisn't inclusive of differing political perspectives.  \n\n\"There is going to be a focus on the election at work, and we have to get out\nin front of it,\" Taylor said, adding that it is crucial for employers to stay\nneutral. He admitted he wanted to take a ride on Air Force One when he was\ninvited recently, but he knew it would cross the line from policy to politics.\n\"We don't want to engage in politics,\" Taylor said.\n\nZack O'Connor, director of human resources at the Fort George Brewery + Public\nHouse in Astoria, Ore., said there haven't been any blow-ups about the\npresidential election among the company's politically diverse staff of about\n150 people. However, he does worry that could change as the rhetoric becomes\nmore heated. \"It's something we need to think about,\" he said. \"We have to\nmaintain our value system and remind everyone that we have to share the\ncountry.\"  \n\n  \n\n[Leadership and Navigation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Leadership and\nNavigation)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=SHRM%e2%80%99s+Vision+for+2020&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/hr-\ntoday/news/hr-news/Pages/SHRM-Vision-for-2020.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

Self-financed\nfrom the outset by its 30 customers (Bouygues Construction, Eurotunnel, SPIE,\netc.), the company raised this first round of financing from MySeedCap, BPI\nFrance, BNP, CIC, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and a group of Euratechnologies Business\nAngels.\n\nCreated in 2015 by 3 mining engineers, Olivier Rohou, Florian Bojda and Jean-\nBaptiste Noachovitch, eLamp aims to become the platform of reference when\ncompanies wish to map data on the knowledge of their teams and employees. In\nsimple terms, it captures the competencies of teams, wherever they are, and\nmakes them usable in business processes. Its technology, which makes uses of\nAI and machine learning, can match different skill portfolios (employees,\nprojects, professions, training, etc), and adapt skills management rules to\nmeet structural and regulatory challenges of companies, among others. Easy to\nimplement, its open and documented APIs are based on market standard\ntechnologies. Currently, the platform is available in 10 languages and 13\ndifferent countries (including China and Russia,) in both web and mobile\nversions, and has more than 30 customers worldwide.\n\nOlivier Rohou, CEO and co-founder of eLamp, said: \" _Currently, companies do\nnot know their employees, which slows down staffing, certification management\nand strategic decision-making processes on their resource pools. Our\ntechnology allows companies to switch from a business approach to a competency\napproach by identifying, in real time, all the skills of their employees.\nIntegrated into operational processes, eLamp becomes the processor of the\ncompetency data and the foundation for all processes: staffing, HR and\ncertifications/authorizations \". _\n\nWhat convinced investors to invest was the new opportunity that eLamp offers\nto go beyond the exclusive HR framework, offering a business-oriented solution\ncapable of improving both operational performance and HR processes.\n\nThe fresh funds will be used in particular to develop four strategic axes,\nincluding commercial development in France and then in Europe,\nindustrialization of deployments for key accounts, innovation and R&D of their\ndata model and user experience, and team expansion in Lille and Paris to\ndouble its workforce in 2020.\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [eLamp](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/elamp/)\n  * [employee development](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/employee-development/)\n  * [employee management](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/employee-management/)\n  * [employee training](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/employee-training/)\n  * [hr](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/hr/)\n  * [human resource](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/human-resource/)\n  * [Lille](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/lille/)\n  * [Paris](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/paris/)\n  * [soft skills](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/soft-skills/)\n\nSHARE\n\n[__Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-\nstartups.com%2F2020%2F03%2Flille-based-elamp-raises-e2-million-to-expand-its-\nemployee-skills-management-platform%2F)\n[__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Lille-\nbased+eLamp+raises+%E2%82%AC2+million+to+expand+its+employee+skills+management+platform&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-\nstartups.com%2F2020%2F03%2Flille-based-elamp-raises-e2-million-to-expand-its-\nemployee-skills-management-platform%2F&via=EU_Startups)\n[](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-\nstartups.com%2F2020%2F03%2Flille-based-elamp-raises-e2-million-to-expand-its-\nemployee-skills-management-platform%2F&title=Lille-\nbased+eLamp+raises+%E2%82%AC2+million+to+expand+its+employee+skills+management+platform&source=EU-\nStartups) [__](whatsapp://send?text=Lille-\nbased+eLamp+raises+%E2%82%AC2+million+to+expand+its+employee+skills+management+platform%20-%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-\nstartups.com%2F2020%2F03%2Flille-based-elamp-raises-e2-million-to-expand-its-\nemployee-skills-management-platform%2F)\n\n  *   * [tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\nPrevious article[\"Look up funds that are targeting you as founders\": Interview\nwith founder of Unconventional Ventures, Thea (Women's Day\nspecial)](https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/03/look-up-funds-that-are-\ntargeting-you-as-founders-interview-with-founder-of-unconventional-ventures-\nthea/)\n\nNext article[Copenhagen-based Penni.io snaps up \u20ac2 million to help insurance\ncompanies open to new online markets](https://www.eu-\nstartups.com/2020/03/copenhagen-based-penni-io-snaps-up-e2-million-to-help-\ninsurance-companies-open-to-new-online-markets/)\n\n[![](https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/plugins/user-avatar/user-avatar-\npic.php?src=https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/avatars/14006/1574860853-bpfull.jpg&w=96&id=14006&random=1574860853)](https://www.eu-\nstartups.com/author/charlotte-tucker/)\n\n[Charlotte Tucker](https://www.eu-startups.com/author/charlotte-tucker/)\n\nCharlotte is the Head of Content at EU-Startups.com.

year in review: Performance management systems\n\nA look at some recent developments within performance management over the\nyear.\n\n![The year in review: Performance management\nsystems](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1577497803/1577497802.jpg)\n\nPerformance management and assessments have always proved a crucial way to\nassess employee productivity and create the right basis for employee promotion\nand appreciation. A robust performance management system plays an important\nrole in helping companies determine the efficacy of their workforce while\nensuring employees have a clear idea of the important parameters of\nassessment. With such an important role, it's of little wonder that 2019 has\nwitnessed many companies experiment with the right way to undertake\nperformance management and technology has had a central role in play in many\nof such changes.\n\nFor companies, getting performance management right has become imperative.\nWith external market conditions becoming more competitive and technology\ndisrupting much of how business once used to happen, having the right\nperformance management system in place means having a clear idea where and how\nto make employees more productive. It also helps companies address\ninefficiencies in their workforce and develop the people with the right fit\nand skills even further.\n\nWith this intent in mind, it comes as little surprise how the relevancy of\nupdating the performance management system has become an important HR\npriority. A Gartner report notes that a vast majority of HR leaders (84%) are\nworking to fix their performance management systems. Also, to making the\nprocess more impactful, factors like perception of performance management as\nbureaucratic, costly and of the low-value processes make it important for HR\nprofessionals to revamp performance management to make it more robust.\n\nThe year saw a shift of many companies moving away from traditional, often\nannual ways of addressing performance issues and taking up a rather dynamic\napproach. The best companies are shifting away from rigid systems toward a\nmore flexible approach that reinforces the critical behaviors that matter\nevery day and aligned individual work with organizational goals. Effective\nperformance management includes providing meaningful, real-time feedback;\nensuring that employees have clear expectations; and coaching employees to\nachieve their maximum performance levels. The following aspects of performance\nmanagement took center stage this year\n\n### Compensation models\n\nToday these is a need to measure performance more accurately. Employees,\nespecially in companies that operate in highly disruptive industries like tech\nand finance, often work through different projects and cross-functional teams/\nPerformance management as a result too has become more holistic. 360-degree\nreview, for example, is slowly becoming accepted as a form of performance\nreview and helps make the entire process more adaptive.\n\n### Employee experience and development\n\nEmployee experience has become an important factor to influence performance\nmanagement systems. Much like how other aspects of modern-day HR take employee\nexperience into account, performance management systems have begun doing the\nsame. Today employee experience refers to the culture that the employees are a\npart of through their entire interaction with the company. The process has\nbeen made to feel less transactional and cumbersome for employees and helps in\nenabling employees to improve their overall performance. Managers too are\nbeing trained on having performance-based discussions that help address gaps\nand make employees more productive.\n\n### Role of technology\n\nThe growing role of HR tech has enabled performance management to be more\ndata-driven and take into account a larger set of data to remove bias. The\ndigital technologies within performance management have made it more real-time\nand impactful in driving productivity. But with such a rise, there also is the\nneed to build the right ways to leverage tech. With the application of AI and\nautomation increasing, HR professionals will aim to create more robust and\nmeaningful performance reviews, in the coming years.\n\n### Succession planning and training gaps\n\nPerformance management systems have been tuned to create ways of assessing\ncompetency gaps and developing talent. HR professionals can leverage such\nsystems to identify high performing talent and plan leadership succession with\ngreater accuracy. By building systems that are continuous and involve a\n360-degree performance review, HR professionals can contribute more\nstrategically to businesses and channelize efforts to retain key talent.\n\nThe bedrock many such changes in performance management in recent years has\nbeen in the case of improving the effectiveness of such systems in the first\nplace. Usually being a cumbersome process and one that many dreaded, the aim\nof performance management to make an employee more productive has been an\nimportant force of change this year. This shift is important as many companies\nhave begun extending this concept to undertake performance management more\ncontinuously. In an attempt to make change performance management from a\nperiodic, transactional, and often tick in the box activity, HR professionals\nare actively trying to use it to add more value to employee work.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Performance Management](/category/compensation-\nperformance/performance-\nmanagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=performance-management

read\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/themes/riskandinsurance/avatars/468.png)\n\nJosh Bersin writes _HRE_ \u2019s HR in the Flow of Work column. Bersin is an\nanalyst, author, educator and thought leader focusing on the global talent\nmarket and the challenges and trends impacting business workforces around the\nworld. He recently spoke at the [HR Technology Conference in Las\nVegas](https://www.hrtechnologyconference.com/). He can be emailed at\nhreletters@lrp.com.\n\nTopics: [Columnists](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hpb/hpb-columnists/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [HR\nTechnology Conference News](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-\ntechnology-conference/)\n\nWhy the HR Business Partner is An Evolving Role\n\nIn July, I convened a meeting with senior HR leaders from a range of\ncompanies, including Verizon, IBM, P&G, United Health Group, Medidata, BASF\nand Colgate-Palmolive. The meeting\u2019s sole purpose was to discuss the role of\nthe HR business partner in modern business.\n\nThroughout the day, we discussed how this role has changed over the years and\nwhat it looks like now; the traits and skills required; and the kind of\ntraining and development activities that would help HR professionals move into\nthe role. As expected, each leader brought different perspectives to the\nconversation.\n\nIn this month\u2019s column, I\u2019ll discuss my view of the HRBP role\u2014past and\npresent. In next month\u2019s column, I\u2019ll share how an evolved role fits into the\n[ongoing transformation of HR](http://hrexecutive.com/here-is-hrs-chance-to-\nbuild-the-workforce-of-the-future/) and some of the ideas we discussed for\ntraining and development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nSHRM describes an HR business partner as follows: \u201cThe HR business partner\nposition is responsible for aligning business objectives with employees and\nmanagement in designated business units. The position serves as a consultant\nto management on human resource-related issues. The successful HRBP acts as an\nemployee champion and change agent.\"\n\nI view the HR business partner as a \u201cforward-facing\u201d HR consultant embedded in\nthe business. HRBPs should live in the business, understand it thoroughly and\nwork proactively with business leaders on various workforce challenges and\nstrategies. I would prefer to do away with the term \u201cpartner\u201d because it\ncontinues to reinforce the idea that the individual is just an HR order taker\nspecifically assigned to the business.\n\nI believe the HRBP role exists in some fashion in virtually any company. In\nsmall companies, vice presidents of HR or HR managers are essentially business\npartners. In large global companies, HRBPs are resident in business units,\ngeographies or functions. While they are expected to have extensive knowledge\nabout HR operations, their more important function is as senior advisors,\nconsultants and experts to business leaders. Their allegiance is first to\ntheir business leaders, second to HR.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nIn fact, all involved in the discussion agreed that deep HR domain expertise\nwas not a critical capability of the HRBP role. It was assumed HRBPs know the\nHR basics and have had prior experience in one or more HR functions. Meeting\nattendees agreed that mindset, problem-solving capabilities, listening and\ncommunication skills, and relationship building are what really drive value in\nthe HRBP role.\n\nI also think it\u2019s critical that high-performing HRBPs are\n[agile](http://hrexecutive.com/is-your-enterprise-agile-enough-for-the-\nfuture/) in the sense that they can jump into new projects, move to new roles\nand learn through ongoing experiences.\n\nFollowing is a more comprehensive list of the individual competencies\nidentified in the working session of our meeting:\n\n  * **Intellectual curiosity and empathy.** HRBPs must have a desire to learn all aspects of the business and understand its goals. In fact, an HRBP should view attainment of these goals as a critical measure of his/her performance. Additionally, HRBPs must have deep caring for the business workforce and be a proactive force behind workforce strategy.\n  * **Problem solving.** HRBPs must be comfortable working with business leaders and managers to address any workforce challenges or issues. And, rather than viewing problems as \u201cyours,\u201d they should view them as \u201cours\u201d and be an active part of the solution.\n  * **Risk taking and courage.** HRBPs must be comfortable saying \u201cno\u201d and offering alternative opinions or actions to business leaders. They also must be ready to fail (and have the air cover to allow for failure).\n  * **Digital acumen.** This was one of the most important characteristics identified by meeting attendees, due to the [increased availability of people-related data](http://hrexecutive.com/what-hr-transformations-are-on-the-horizon/). Today, HRBPs must have the ability to analyze and interpret data, use it to help business leaders better understand workforce needs and incorporate results into workforce strategy and planning.\n  * **Business-language knowledge.** To ensure credibility, HRBPs need to be able to speak \u201cin business.\u201d This comes with knowing the details of the business they are serving and understanding its jargon and acronyms.\n  * **Networking skills.** \u201cKnowing who knows\u201d within the business unit, as well as externally, is hugely important, as is the ability to develop relationships with those who have knowledge and decision-making power.\n  * **Change-management skills.** HRBPs must have the ability to facilitate discussions around change and transformation. Additionally, they must be able to identify in advance where and when change management will be needed and proactively participate in developing plans.\n  * **Discretion.** Several attendees who have served as HRBPs in their careers stressed the importance of this. Business leaders need to trust their HRBPs with sensitive, \u201cinsider\u201d information. For instance, a sales manager needs to know a conversation about potentially missing sales goals will be kept confidential.\n\nPersonally, I do not believe the HRBP role is going away; rather, it is\nbecoming more important. In next month\u2019s column, I will write about how this\nrole is changing, suggested ways to develop candidates for the role and how\nstrategic deployment of HRBPs can facilitate the transformation of HR\norganizations.\n\nI also look forward to more discussion on this topic\u2014particularly how\ntechnology advancements are impacting the HRBP role\u2014at the upcoming [HR\nTechnology Conference and\nExposition\u00ae](https://www.hrtechnologyconference.com/).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2F8-skills-\nhr-business-partners-need-for-success%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=8+Skills+HR+Business+Partners+Need+for+Success&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2F8-skills-\nhr-business-partners-need-for-success%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2F8-skills-\nhr-business-partners-need-for-success%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

HR management is driven by HR functions and several HR\nprinciples.\n\nHuman Resource Management (HRM) is a collective term for all the formal\nsystems created to help manage employees and other stakeholders within a\ncompany.\n\nEach organization has its human resources, which should be managed effectively\nbecause the success of the organization in the competitive environment is\ndependent on human resource factors. Other resources (financial,\ntechnological, and so on) are common to almost every organization.\n\nThe HR department plays a central role in managing the employees of the\norganization. For this purpose, it performs key functions of HRM.\n\nBusinesses should be aware of such functions: Employment, recruitment,\nselection, training and development, employee services, salary and wages,\nindustrial relations, health and safety, education, working conditions,\nappraisal and assessment, compensation and benefits, employee and labour\nrelations, and human resource research.  \n\nThe HR department thrives on specific principles.\n\n **Commitment**\n\nOne aspect that the HR department tries to deal with is job security. To\nguarantee job security, many employees know that they need to show commitment\nto the company and their job duties.\n\nThe HR management implements measures that ensure that staffing levels\ncorrespond to the company's needs, and in the process, assure employees of\ntheir long-term positions within the organization.\n\n **Competence**\n\nThe success of a firm depends on the competence of its employees. The HR\ndepartment tries to sustain workforce competency by providing training\nopportunities.\n\nIt also schedules orientation programs, which provide avenues to enlighten new\nemployees on a company's mission and objectives.\n\n **Cost-effectiveness**\n\nFirms must ensure that they compensate their workers accordingly. The worker\nreward system must be able to sustain the firm or the organization.\n\n **Coherence**\n\nAll methods undertaken by an organization or a company in the management of\nhuman resources should be in consonance with the firm's vision and mission. In\nlike manner, Human resource managers must direct their concentration on what\nthe firm needs and the abilities of its employees.\n\n **Comprehensiveness**  \n\nThis covers the efficient management of all aspects of the individuals\nworking, keeping in consideration that human resources are actually the most\nessential resource the firm possesses.\n\nIn other words, in terms of health, financial needs, or transportation,\nanything that workers require must be properly taken care of.\n\n **Recruitment to retirement**\n\nHR is all about dealing with employees from recruitment to retirement. It\nincludes manpower planning, selection, training and development, placement,\nwage and salary administration, promotions, transfers, separation, performance\nappraisal, grievance handling, welfare administration, job evaluation, merit\nrating, and exit interview.\n\nPeople behind the machine count -- previously, it used to be the machine\nbehind the people that counted. Today, people are the real power to drive\norganizations forward. Machines only assist people.\n\n **Hire for attitude, recruit for skills**  \n\nAttitude is the key to employee engagement and success. Hence, HR leaders must\nemphasize attitude rather than experience. It is better to hire a new job-\nseeker with a good attitude and no experience, than one with a rotten attitude\nand years of experience.\n\n **Appreciate attitude but respect intelligence**  \n\nIt is true that both attitude and intelligence are essential to improving the\norganizational bottom line.\n\nIf HR leaders find it is tough to get both, they should choose attitude over\nintelligence, as it helps accomplish organizational goals and objectives.\n\n **Hire slow, fire fast**\n\nHR leaders must be slow in hiring the right talent for their organizations.\nThey must look for the right mindset, skill set, and tool set in job seekers\nduring recruitment.\n\nIf they find that bad apples entered into their basket, they must be removed\nquickly to contain further damage to their organizations.\n\n **Shed complexity, wed simplicity**\n\nPeople today prefer to work in flat organizations rather than tall ones. Tall\norganizations often have hierarchies with a bureaucratic mindset that doesn't\nwork in the present context.\n\nStaff are happy to work with partners rather than with bosses. So shed\ncomplexity and wed simplicity to achieve organizational excellence and\neffectiveness.\n\n **HR leaders are the masters in makers**\n\nHR leaders are masters of their trades, not jacks of other trades. They know\neverything about HR, but they don't necessarily know much about other aspects\nin the organization.\n\nCEOs are masters in their own domains and jacks of other domains. They are\nmasters in their areas and know something about others areas.\n\n **To serve is to lead and live**  \n\nHR leaders must serve people with pleasure without any pressure. They must\nbecome torch-bearers of human capital and knowledge. They must learn, unlearn,\nand relearn to stay relevant.\n\nHuman resource management does not just handle the recruitment of new\nemployees; it also oversees other business-related matters for companies that\nwant to downsize.\n\nOverall, human resource management guarantees the smooth running of employees\nwithin a company by following HR functions and principles.\n\n  \n _Taslim Ahammad

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nCarmen Feinberg\n\nExperienced Human Resources executive-level consultant focusing on cultivating\ncultures of productivity and profit.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nShutterstock\n\nMany human resources competencies are non-negotiable, because a lack of them\ncould mean the difference between business success or failure. No smart\nbusiness owner with employees will \u2014 nor should \u2014 discount the impact of human\nbeings and their contribution, connection, communication and emotion when\nconducting business. This should be where human resources comes in. Here are\nseven essential HR competencies for business success:\n\n**1\\. Effectively navigate the hierarchical structure:**  It is not easy to\n[align groups](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateharrison/2014/10/02/employee-\nalignment-the-secret-sauce-to-success/#3cb47d3be024), grapple with politics,\ncommunicate in a way people can hear and more. Many departments think others\ndon\u2019t work as hard. Many executives think employees don\u2019t appreciate what they\nhave. Many individuals think they are \u201cthe one\u201d that makes it all happen.\nHuman resources gets the awesomely challenging responsibility of giving\neveryone that \u201ccheck\u201d needed to remember it takes a team.\n\n**2\\. Have a vision aligned with the CEO:** It is truly like a marriage,\nbecause human resources leaders must align their vision of company culture\nwith the CEO\u2019s vision of profits. Once there is alignment here, HR gets the\ndistinct honor of convincing everyone else on staff to align under this shared\numbrella. [Staying true to facts and a vision](https://hbr.org/2007/10/the-\nimportance-of-vision) is as important as proactive, ongoing communication and\nalignment directly with the CEO as climates and markets and profits change.\nIt\u2019s up to human resources to bridge the gap between employers and employees\nand then get everyone moving the same direction.\n\n**3\\. Exhibit influence:** Without influence, which can only come from\nconsistency in character, human resources leaders will not succeed. There is\nno way around it. This takes an extremely competent person because the only\nway to gain influence is to be more proficient than the majority \u2014 and, in\ndoing so, win more battles than you lose. If HR cannot be respected overall,\nthey cannot be effective. There is no shortcut to take.\n\n**4\\. Have personal integrity:** HR leaders have the toughest job of all when\nthey are positioned smack in the middle of opposing conflicts between multiple\nlevels of leadership and their staff. It truly takes a special skill to bring\nthese entities together as one unit. As already stated, the only way to move\npeople is for them to believe in your character and integrity.\n\n**5\\. Navigate with ethical consistency:** Human resources is the place where\nit is ultimately decided, with managers and leaders, who stays and who goes.\nIt\u2019s the place where it is decided if sexual harassment occurred and what the\nconsequence is, if so. It\u2019s where investigation, confrontation and consequence\nhappens for bribery, conflicts of interest, discrimination and competency\nmanagement. It's even where it's determined if and when it\u2019s OK to bring\nchildren and pets into the workplace \u2014 not to mention, HR is the final say\nregarding the legalities and ethics of hiring and firing real people with real\nfamilies and real personal needs. Each of these situations must be navigated\nwith equal diligence and ethical consistency.\n\n**6\\. Expertise in behavioral communication techniques:** Building\nrelationships, creating and leading a team, behaving with [emotional\nintelligence](https://www.trainingjournal.com/articles/features/managers-\nguide-emotional-intelligence), managing conflicts, building trust,\nnegotiating, effectively communicating and then translating, leading diversity\ninitiatives, understanding business implications, leading organizational and\noperational change management, etc. \u2014 the list is endless. Human resources has\nbecome a sort of catch-all for executing, evaluating and redirecting all\ndepartments' and employees' behaviors and communications.\n\n**7\\. Know technical human resources laws and practices:**  These include\nbenefits, EEOC, FLSA, OSHA, HRIS, ATS, [sexual\nharassment](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2018/04/13/employers-\ncliffs-notes-for-creating-sexual-harassment-policies-in-a-metoo-world/),\nemployment laws (by state), recruiting, payroll, compensation strategies and\nbenchmarking, strategic planning, talent acquisition, employee engagement,\nlearning and development, total rewards, organizational structure, operational\neffectiveness, workforce management, labor relations, technology and risk\nmanagement, disaster recovery, auditing, security, corporate social\nresponsibility, mission/vision/values ... just to name a few. Know this list\nis certainly not all-inclusive, and that it is imperative for HR leaders to be\nwell-versed with technical acumen, real-world best practices and SOPs.\n\nRequired competencies for HR professionals are vast, and executing these takes\ncharacter and strength \u2014 not just overnight or whimsical character and\nstrength, but the hardcore kind that\u2019s not easy to come by. It\u2019s not a\nprofession for the meek, and choosing HR leaders wisely is one of the most\nimportant things that CEOs must get right. It takes absolute superstars to\nnavigate the complex world that falls under the term \u201chuman resources.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t recognize these terms or your HR leader doesn\u2019t have these\nresponsibilities or competencies and instead just processes new hires, writes\npolicies and oversees the monthly birthday cake and company parties, then you\nare exposed and potentially in danger as a business. And even more\nimportantly, you are leaving tons of money on the table, rather than in your\npocket. Make finding and keeping the right human resources leader a high\npriority.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Carmen Feinberg](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2018/03/carmenfeinberg_avatar_1522247923-400x400.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/carmenfeinberg/\n\"Photo of Carmen Feinberg\")\n\n[Carmen\nFeinberg](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/carmenfeinberg/)\n\nExperienced Human Resources executive-level consultant focusing on cultivating\ncultures of productivity and profit.\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Carmen Feinberg&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: Seven Human Resources Competencies That Drive Company Success %0A Author: Carmen Feinberg %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2018/05/11/seven-human-resources-competencies-that-drive-company-success/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

But often, it's HR's own staff that gets\noverlooked in the process. [Phyllis G.\nHartman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phyllis-hartman-b726a09/)'s [_A Manager's\nGuide to Developing Competencies in HR\nStaff_](https://store.shrm.org/a-manager-s-guide-to-developing-competencies-\nin-hr-staff-tips-and-tools-for-improving-proficiency-in-your-reports.html)\n(SHRM, 2017) is here to help. Hartman, who hold a SHRM-SCP, is the founder of\n[PGHR Consulting](http://pghrconsulting.com/) and has more than 25 years of\nexperience as a human resource professional. Her book helps HR managers\nunderstand the work of developing their staff in an organized, step-by-step\nway.\n\nThe _HR Magazine_ Book Blog recently spoke to Hartman about the book.\n\n **How does your new book take the mystery out of HR staff development?**\n\nMost HR professionals understand the traditional functional areas of HR but\nmay struggle with the connection to competencies. Developing HR staff often\nseems overwhelming to HR managers as they are faced with daily challenges and\ndemands. There is just not enough time in the day, and staff development may\ntake a back seat. This book includes hundreds of ideas for developing\ncompetencies that managers can use immediately or as jumping-off points for\ntheir own or other employees' ideas.\n\n**How should HR managers charged with development of HR staff use the book?**\n\nThe book can be used in multiple ways. As a broad text, it supplies managers\nwith a total competency development road map, from assessing individual and\ngroup needs to developing HR staff. If an individual already knows what they\nneed, he or she can get advice on how to assess their own proficiency levels.\nIf a manager knows what is needed, the book provides hundreds of ideas,\ngrouped in different approaches and activities that can help boost HR employee\ndevelopment. The strategies can be easily customized to fit the needs of the\nindividual and the team.\n\n **One of the toughest challenges HR managers face with HR staff development\nis which competencies to focus on. Any recommendations?**\n\nIt all goes to understanding the business or organization and its mission and\ngoals. HR managers must know what is important to their organization's\nsuccess. Collaborating with the management team to learn about the goals and\nthen apply them to the HR function is the first step. Once that is done, you\ncan identify the most critical competencies for the organization and HR. Next,\nan analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the HR team should be done. By\ndetermining the gaps and then prioritizing needs based on available financial\nand time resources, the manager can make a plan.\n\n**What are some direct and indirect ways of assessing current employees?**\n\nBy communicating directly with employees using a focused set of questions that\nencourage discussion about specific competencies, managers can assess not just\nknowledge but the ability to appropriately apply skills. Discussions also\nincrease the likelihood that the employee will participate in development and\nbe engaged. Communicating with others can help managers evaluate proficiency,\ntoo. Indirect ways include reviewing existing documentation, career history\nand experiences, and examining certifications achieved.\n\n **How can HR managers create development plans for their HR staff, and for\nthemselves?**\n\nOnce managers know what is needed in terms of specific competency development,\nthey can begin to determine activities that will lead to proficiency. Practice\nleads to proficiency. Development activities need to be planned with the\ninterest and learning preferences of the individual in mind.\n\nThe other major factor to take into consideration is available resources,\nincluding money and time. This may require setting priorities as to who gets\ndevelopment when, but care should be taken not to neglect the manager's needs.\nThe book provides a number of forms and references to make planning easier.\n\n **What were you surprised to learn researching and writing the book?**\n\nProbably the biggest surprise in talking to many HR professionals was learning\nthat there is still some confusion about what competencies really are. At\ntimes over the last two years when I asked the question \"What is the most\nimportant competency in your HR department?,\" I got answers that included\nthings that are not competencies. I was also surprised to hear business\nmanagers talk about developing competencies by \"sending someone to a class.\"\nThough knowledge is certainly a part of competency, the skills, abilities and\nother traits are equally important, and I'm not sure everyone understands\nthat.\n\n **The book includes real-life examples and insights from current HR managers.\nCan you share some of your favorite top tips?**\n\nFern\u00e1n R. Cepero, SHRM-SCP, chief human resources officer and chief diversity\nofficer of the YMCA of Greater Rochester in New York, says that one way his\norganization develops competencies is by recognizing the value of \"internal\nsharing.\" This helps HR staff develop both communication and consultation\ncompetencies.\n\nHaving an organizational commitment to development is important in garnering\nresources. Often, not just time but also experiences are needed that go beyond\nwhat you can provide inside an organization. Beverly Widger, SHRM-SCP, senior\nVP of human resources at Mascoma Savings Bank in Lebanon, N.H., says her\norganization supports development and has an HR budget devoted to it. By\nworking with local universities, her organization is able to offer high-level\nprograms that go beyond internal classes and programs.\n\nTim A. Baker, SHRM-SCP, senior director for talent management and\norganizational development at Williamsburg-James City County Public Schools in\nVirginia, says his experience working in three very different school\ndistricts, as well as in the private sector, has taught him that every\nemployee is different when it comes to development.  \n\n _Matt Davis is manager, book publishing, at SHRM._  \n\n  \n\n[Organization and Employee\nDevelopment](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Organization and Employee\nDevelopment) [Leadership and\nNavigation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Leadership and Navigation)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=A+Manager%27s+Guide+to+Developing+Competencies+in+HR+Staff+&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/hr-\ntoday/news/hr-magazine/1017/Pages/a-managers-guide-to-developing-competencies-\nin-hr-staff-.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

As more data is collected through\nnew platforms and tools, HR professionals can identify where employee turnover\nis spiking and why, correlate hiring data with employee performance or\ndemonstrate the influence of engagement on workforce productivity.\n\nBut adding data-analytics competency in the HR staff is a challenge. In a\ntight labor market, applicants with these skills are scarce\u2014and expensive.\nMany HR leaders in smaller companies are forced to build those capabilities by\ntraining existing staff or borrowing experts from other functional areas,\nrather than recruit externally to fill those roles.\n\nA recent study report, _The Age of Analytics_ , by McKinsey & Company details\nthe nature of that recruiting challenge. Approximately half of executives\nsurveyed reported greater difficulty in recruiting analytical talent than\nfilling any other kind of role in their organization, the study found.\n\nMany HR functions face hurdles when seeking to add analytics competencies to\ntheir staffs, said Jeanne Achille, chair of the Women in HR Tech Summit at the\nannual HR Technology Conference & Exposition and CEO of the Devon Group.\n\n\"HR is swimming in data but often doesn't have the staff to help interpret\nthat data in a meaningful way for the business,\" Achille said. \"In terms of\nrecruiting for those roles, I think we're still several years out from having\nan established talent pool.\"\n\nGiven that challenge, what are the best ways to build data-analytics skills\nfor HR staff who may have limited quantitative, statistical or storytelling\nabilities?\n\n _[SHRM members-only platform : _[_SHRM\nConnect_](https://community.shrm.org/home?_ga=2.268625778.206560651.1493167936-920689375.1491920969)\n_]_\n\nData Analytics Training Options\n\nSome HR leaders don't have the luxury of having dedicated data analysts on\nstaff, so they turn instead to educating HR generalists in those skills or\nrecruiting others with some social science or quantitative backgrounds, said\nJake Ridgway, vice president of people with Health Union in Philadelphia.\n\nRidgway believes generalists can be taught skills such as learning to sift\nthrough data in an HR information system (HRIS) or applicant tracking system\nto identify trends and using visual representations to show the data. In\nlarger organizations, dedicated HR data analysts often have responsibilities\nthat include developing and maintaining HR analytical tools or dashboards,\nensuring the accuracy and consistency of datasets, and partnering with\nworkforce planning teams.\n\nBut Ridgway believes one of the most important skills for any data analyst to\nhave is storytelling ability. \"You don't need to be a Python coding expert or\nto run SPSS regressions to add value in data analytics,\" Ridgway said. \"Having\nbasic data literacy skills along with an ability to use Excel and PowerPoint\nto tell impactful stories about workforce data can go a long way.\"\n\nWhat do HR leaders and industry experts think would make a good analytics\ntraining curriculum for HR generalists? Whether delivered internally or\nexternally through university programs or massive, open, online learning\ncourses, that content might cover quantitative and mathematical skills, data\ngathering, survey design, root cause analysis, hypothesis generation and\nstorytelling with data.\n\nJeff Mike, vice president and head of the HR research practice for Bersin,\nDeloitte Consulting, said HR organizations successful in building data-\nanalytics competencies often use multidisciplinary training approaches\nfeaturing action learning projects. \"They might put a cross-functional team\ntogether with HR business partners or generalists along with data analysts\nborrowed from other parts of the organization who can translate their\nexpertise to HR,\" he said.\n\nMike said smaller HR functions may not need a dedicated data analyst if they\nhave access to one elsewhere in the company. \"But everyone in HR should be\ndata-literate enough today to understand how people data influences business\ndata,\" he said.\n\nSome experts believe a combination of buy and build approaches can work best.\nFor example, an HR leader might hire a seasoned data analyst who can help\ntrain others in the function, as well as have those who complete external\neducation programs return to train their peers.\n\n\"The more HR understands the business, the more we can use data in a way that\nspeaks directly to the challenges line leaders have, rather than just trying\nto guess what those challenges are or trying to solve for problems HR thinks\nis interesting but others in the organization don't see as a high priority,\"\nRidgway said.\n\nData Analyst or Data Scientist?\n\nThe growing demand for data analysts and data scientists has led more academic\ninstitutions to develop programs specifically for HR needs. One example is the\nMaster of Science in human capital analytics and technology at New York\nUniversity (NYU). The seven-course core curriculum features content in data\nanalysis and automation, along with foundations of behavioral and\norganizational sciences.\n\nA prerequisite to the program is the \"Foundations of Analytics for Human\nCapital Management\" course, designed to help aspiring or new HR professionals\nperform data analysis, get familiar with analytics tools and develop an\nability to communicate insights from data analysis to the rest of the company.\n\nRoy Altman, an HR analytics expert and former HRIS manager at Memorial Sloan\nKettering Cancer Center in New York City, is an instructor in the NYU program.\nHe said understanding the distinction between data analysts and data\nscientists when making staffing decisions is important for HR leaders.\n\nData analysts have an ability to analyze workforce data and extract insights\nfor line managers, in addition to other data management skills, Altman said.\nData scientists have competencies in such skills as regression analysis,\nmachine learning programming or mathematical modeling and usually hold\nadvanced degrees.\n\n\"The bigger need in HR is usually for data analysts skilled at correlating\ndata and translating their findings into relevant stories for line managers\nand executives,\" Altman said. He added that some of the capabilities data\nscientists provide to organizations, such as machine learning or predictive\nanalytics, are now embedded in vendors' software tools.\n\nTeaching HR staff to look beneath the surface of workforce data is key to good\ntraining approaches, Altman said. For example, just presenting reports to\nexecutives that show general turnover or diversity metrics isn't enough.\n\n\"You might run a report that shows 50 percent of your employee population is\nmade up of women and members of minority groups, so it appears you're doing\nfine in diversity,\" he said. \"But if you map the percentage of those\npopulations at each level of the organization, it might tell a different\nstory. The role of data analysts is to tell stories with numbers that help\nleaders see what's really happening in their organizations.\"\n\n _Dave Zielinski is a freelance business writer and editor in Minneapolis._\n\n[HR Careers](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=HR Careers) [HR Technology\nCareers](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=HR Technology Careers) [Business and\nCompetitive Awareness](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Business and\nCompetitive Awareness)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Buy%2c+Build+or+Borrow%3f+How+to+Develop+Data-\nAnalytics+Skills+in+HR&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/technology/Pages/How-to-Develop-Data-Analytics-Skills-in-HR.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

HR analytics is defined as the\nprocess of measuring the impact of HR metrics, such as time to hire and\nretention rate, on business performance._\n\nHuman resources is a people-oriented function and is so perceived by most\npeople. But for those who think that the HR team\u2019s contributions are limited\nto extending offer letters and onboarding new hires, human resource analytics\n(HR analytics) can prove them wrong. When used strategically, analytics can\ntransform how HR operates, giving the team insights and allowing it to\nactively and meaningfully contribute to the organization\u2019s bottom line.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d82188ac18b5.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nIf you are looking to get started with HR analytics, this guide is for you.\n\n## **Table of Contents**\n\n  * **What Is HR Analytics?**\n  * **What Metrics Does HR Analytics Measure?**\n  * **What Data Does an HR Analytics Tool Need?**\n  * **How to Get Started With HR Analytics**\n  * **So, Should You Invest in an HR Analytics Solution?**\n\n## **What Is HR Analytics?**\n\nTo understand the essence of HR analytics and to explain how it impacts\nbusiness performance, we asked Mick Collins, Global Vice President, Workforce\nAnalytics & Planning Solution Strategy and Chief Expert at SAP SuccessFactors,\nto break it down for us.\n\n\u201cHR analytics is a methodology for creating insights on how investments in\nhuman capital assets contribute to the success of four principal outcomes: (a)\ngenerating revenue, (b) minimizing expenses, (c) mitigating risks, and (d)\nexecuting strategic plans. This is done by applying statistical methods to\nintegrated HR, talent management, financial, and operational data,\u201d says\nCollins in an exclusive discussion with HR Technologist.\n\nHR analytics focuses primarily on the HR function and is not \u2013 as is largely\nbelieved \u2013 exactly interchangeable with **[people\nanalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-\npeople-analytics/)** or workforce analytics.\n\n### I. HR Analytics, People Analytics, and Workforce Analytics: What is the\nDifference?\n\nThe terms HR analytics, people analytics, and workforce analytics are often\nused interchangeably. But there are slight differences between each of these\nterms. It would help you to know the difference to be able to assess the most\nrelevant data to their function.\n\n![The difference between HR Analytics, People Analytics, and Workforce\nAnalytics](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**The difference between HR Analytics, People Analytics, and Workforce\nAnalytics**\n\n**HR analytics:** HR analytics specifically deals with the metrics of the HR\nfunction, such as time to hire, training expense per employee, and time until\npromotion. All these metrics are managed exclusively by HR for HR.\n\n**People analytics:** People analytics, though comfortably used as a synonym\nfor HR analytics, is technically applicable to \u201cpeople\u201d in general. It can\nencompass any group of individuals even outside the organization. For\ninstance, the term \u201cpeople analytics\u201d may be applied to analytics about the\ncustomers of an organization and not necessarily only employees.\n\n**Workforce analytics:** Workforce analytics is an all-encompassing term\nreferring specifically to employees of an organization. It includes on-site\nemployees, remote employees, gig workers, freelancers, consultants, and any\nother individuals working in various capacities in an organization.\n\nIn the HR context, some workforce analytics metrics and HR analytics metrics\nmay overlap, which is why the two terms are often used as synonyms. The goal\nof the two may also be the same.\n\nFor instance, data on employee productivity and performance informs both HR\nand workforce analytics, and the goal is to improve retention rates and\nenhance the employee experience.\n\n**Learn more:** [**What is Human Capital Management\n(HCM)?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-human-capital-management/)\n\n### II. How Does HR Analytics Drive Business Value?\n\nHR has access to valuable employee data. How can this data be used to enable\nchange in the organization?\n\nThere is a great deal of discussion on replicating the consumer experience in\nthe employee experience. Essentially, the data on consumer behavior and\nmindset can help develop strategies to maximize sales by capitalizing on those\nfactors. Similarly, the data useful for the HR function can be used to improve\nemployee performance, the employee experience, and in turn, maximize business\noutcomes.\n\nCollins offers an example of how HR analytics can be used to enhance business\nvalue. \u201cHR analytics could be used to measure investments in reskilling, which\nwill deliver the right competencies to support a new revenue model, using\ndata-driven insights to modify the training offering as sales results emerge.\u201d\n\nThis is definitive granular data that can not only impact the bottom line, it\ncan also transform **[employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/)** in an organization.\n\n\u201cAs such,\u201d Collins continues, \u201cyou might think about the \u2018ROI\u2019 of HR analytics\nbeing that of increasing the business value derived from using data for talent\ndecisions.\u201d\n\n## **What Metrics Does HR Analytics Measure?**\n\n**![Common metrics measured by HR analytics](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**Common metrics measured by HR analytics**\n\nSeveral HR metrics contribute to business value, but the key question when\nmeasuring these metrics is this: what does the business need?\n\nThis question can be best answered by having a conversation with business\nleaders. A strategic collaboration between the C-suite and HR leaders will\nhelp determine the HR analytics strategy.\n\nBased on the key performance indicators (KPI) of the organization, HR can then\npropose the metrics that can influence these KPIs.\n\nIt is important to note that the C-suite sees a clear connection between the\nneed for analytics and the impact it will have on the bottom line. As an HR\npractitioner, you will need to build a case for why tracking metrics related\nspecifically to the people of the company is critical.\n\nFor instance, the C-suite may not be interested in the number of people who\nhave left the organization voluntarily. What might interest them is how many\nof these employees were in strategic positions or were highly skilled, the\nduration of their employment, what led to their exit, the cost of replacing\nthese employees, and finally, how all these events affect company profits.\n\nHere are some common metrics tracked by HR analytics:\n\n**1\\. Revenue per employee:** Obtained by dividing a company\u2019s revenue by the\ntotal number of employees in the company. This indicates the average revenue\neach employee generates. It is a measure of how efficient an organization is\nat enabling revenue generation through employees.\n\n**2\\. Offer acceptance rate:** The number of accepted formal job offers (not\nverbal) divided by the total number of job offers given in a certain period. A\nhigher rate (above 85%) indicates a good ratio. If it is lower, this data can\nbe used to redefine the company\u2019s talent acquisition strategy.\n\n**3\\. Training expenses per employee:** Obtained by dividing the total\ntraining expense by the total number of employees who received training. The\nvalue of this expense can be determined from measuring the training\nefficiency. Poor efficiency may lead you to re-evaluate the training expense\nper employee.\n\n**4.** **Training efficiency:** Obtained from the analysis of multiple data\npoints, such as performance improvement, test scores, and upward transition in\nemployees\u2019 roles in the organization after training. Measuring training\nefficiency can be crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of a training program.\n\n**5\\. Voluntary turnover rate:** Voluntary turnover occurs when employees\nvoluntarily choose to leave their jobs. It is calculated by dividing the\nnumber of employees who left voluntarily by the total number of employees in\nthe organization. This metric can lead to the identification of gaps in the\n[**employee experience**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-experience/) that are leading to voluntary\n**[attrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-attrition-complete-guide/)**.\n\n**6\\. Involuntary turnover rate:** When an employee is terminated from their\nposition, it is termed \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d The rate is calculated by dividing the\nnumber of employees who left involuntarily by the total number of employees in\nthe organization. This metric can be tied back to the recruitment strategy and\nused to develop a plan to improve the quality of hires to avoid involuntary\nturnover.\n\n**7\\. Time to fill:** The number of days between advertising a job opening and\nhiring someone to fill that position. By measuring the time to fill,\nrecruiters can alter their recruitment strategy to identify areas where the\nmost time is being spent.\n\n**8\\. Time to hire:** The number of days between approaching a candidate and\nthe candidate\u2019s acceptance of the job offer. Just like time to fill, data-\ndriven analysis of time to hire can benefit recruiters and help them improve\nthe **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\nto reduce this time.\n\n**9\\. Absenteeism:** Absenteeism is a productivity metric, which is measured\nby dividing the number of days missed by the total number of scheduled\nworkdays. Absenteeism can offer insights into overall employee health and can\nalso serve as an indicator of employee happiness.\n\n**10\\. Human capital risk:** This may include employee-related risks, such as\nthe absence of a specific skill to fill a new type of job, the lack of\nqualified employees to fill leadership positions, the potential of an employee\nto leave the job based on several factors, such as relationship with managers,\ncompensation, and absence of a clear succession plan. HR analytics can be used\nto measure all these metrics.\n\n## **What Data Does an HR Analytics Tool Need?**\n\nBroadly, the data required by an HR analytics tool is classified into internal\nand external data. One of the biggest challenges in data collection is the\ncollection of the right data and quality data.\n\n**![Common data sources HR analytics solutions](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**Common data sources HR analytics solutions**\n\n**I. Internal data**\n\n  \nInternal data specifically refers to data obtained from the HR department of\nan organization. The core HR system contains several data points that can be\nused for an HR analytics tool. Some of the metrics that an HRIS system\ncontains includes:\n\n1\\. Employee tenure  \n2\\. Employee compensation  \n3\\. Employee training records  \n4\\. Performance appraisal data  \n5\\. Reporting structure  \n6\\. Details on high-value, high-potential employees  \n7\\. Details on any disciplinary action taken against an employee\n\nThe only challenge here is that sometimes, this data is disconnected and so\nmay not serve as a reliable measure. This is where the data scientist can play\na meaningful role. They can organize this scattered data and create buckets of\nrelevant data points, which can then be used for the analytics tool.\n\n**II. External data**\n\n  \nExternal data is obtained by establishing working relationships with other\ndepartments of the organization. Data from outside the organization is also\nessential, as it offers a global perspective that working with data from\nwithin the organization cannot.\n\n**1\\. Financial data:** Organization-wide financial data is key in any HR\nanalysis to calculate, for instance, the revenue per employee or the cost of\nhire.\n\n**2\\. Organization-specific data:** Depending on the type of organization and\nits core offering (product or service), the type of data that HR needs to\nsupplement analytics will vary.\n\nFor example, says Collins, \u201cHR leaders at a global retailer should power their\nanalytics engine with store revenue and costs and customer experience data,\nwhereas HR at a construction company might pursue operational \u2013 health and\nsafety \u2013 data and data related to contingent labor costs.\u201d\n\n**3\\. Passive data from employees:** Employees continually provide data that\nis stored in the HRIS from the moment they are approached for a job.\nAdditionally, data from their social media posts and shares and from feedback\nsurveys can be used to guide HR data analysis.\n\n**4\\. Historical data:** Several global economic, political, or environmental\nevents determine patterns in employee behavior. Such data can offer insights\nthat limited internal data cannot.\n\nFor example, the recession in 2008 was a global event that changed the way\nemployees perceived jobs or \u201cwork.\u201d The freelance, start-up and gig economies\ntook off as people continued to lose their jobs. Data from such a critical\nhistorical event can help predict how the workforce may react to similar\nshifts in the future. It can then be used to identify trends in the current\nworkforce and predict voluntary and involuntary turnover.\n\n## **How to Get Started With HR Analytics**\n\nFor HR leaders keen to **get started with using HR analytics** for data-based\ndecision making, here are some tips:\n\n**![The complete HR analytics cycle](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**The complete HR analytics cycle**\n\n### **I. Create a collective mindset**\n\n  \nBefore the operational and mathematical aspect can kick in, HR leaders must\nprepare their teams and organizations for a workflow-driven by analytics.\n\nWhile the discussion with the C-suite for the need for analytics is one part\nof the change, the other is preparing your team to deal with the amount of\ndata that they will now be using to measure the change.\n\nThis is a crucial aspect of **[HR\u2019s digital\ntransformation](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-hr-digital-transformation/)** as well as company-wide\ndigital transformation. Getting the team started on small projects and asking\nthem to create the reports that they will discuss with business leaders is a\ngood way to begin.\n\n### **II. Bring in data scientists**\n\n  \nThe data scientist is expected to become an integral part of HR teams. They\nare best suited to assess the viability of an analytics solution. They can\nalso ensure the robustness of the statistical modeling and predictions.\n\nAs Collins says, \u201cdata scientists will play an invaluable role in creating a\nculture of analytics across HR. As the role of HR business partners and\ngeneralists evolves to include skills such as data strategy, analysis, and\ncommunication (articulating \u2018the story behind the science\u2019), the data\nscientist will serve as the coach, mentoring their colleagues across HR in how\nto understand, and apply, the insights.\u201d\n\n### **III. Start small**\n\n  \nA great technique to convince stakeholders that HR analytics can drive\nbusiness value is to first implement a small project successfully. Called\n\u201cquick wins,\u201d these projects can deliver tangible results in a short amount of\ntime with high impact.\n\n### **IV. Get clearance from the legal team**\n\n  \nThe sort of data collection that HR analytics uses is governed heavily by\ncompliance laws. Some legal considerations to keep in mind when implementing\nan HR analytics solution are:\n\n  1. Employee privacy and anonymity\n  2. Consent from employees about the amount and type of data being collected\n  3. Establishing the goal of data collection and informing employees accordingly\n  4. IT security when using third-party software to run HR analytics\n  5. Location of the HR analytics vendor \u2013 with whom the data will be stored \u2013 and their compliance with local laws\n\n  \nCollaborate with the legal team of your organization to ensure ethics and\ncompliance norms are followed.\n\n### **V. Choose an HR analytics solution**\n\nAny HR analytics solution that will be used at scale must have certain\ncomponents.\n\n**![The key features of an HR analytics solution](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**The key features of an HR analytics solution**\n\n**1\\. They answer the business questions the C-suite asks.** This may require\nthat you invest in a solution to address each question, leading to investments\nin multiple analytics solutions for granular data on each question.\nAlternatively, you may choose a unified solution that can assess multiple\nmetrics to answer each business question.\n\n**2\\. They are easy to use by individuals who are not data scientists.** An\naccessible solution created for laypersons is ideal when they want to assess\nany one or more metrics without interrupting the workflow of the data\nscientist.\n\n**3\\. They are cloud-based rather than on-premise.** A cloud-based solution\nalso aids accessibility without heavy IT integration. This grants HR the\nautonomy to use the solution as and when needed.\n\n**4\\. They are powered with statistical analysis and machine learning\ntechnology.** Big data platforms require advanced data management systems\npowered by machine learning and natural language processing. This allows the\ntechnology to learn and reason autonomously, revealing insights that data\nscientists can then analyze.\n\n**5\\. They are based on predictive analytics.** \u201c[Predictive analytics is] the\npractice of extracting information from existing data sets to determine\npatterns and forecast future outcomes. Analysts use statistical methods to\nforecast future alternatives \u2013 will the current termination rate continue at\nthe same pace or might we expect a surge of exits as the job market\nstrengthens?\u201d explains Collins.\n\n**6\\. They are powered with visualization technology.** A visual\nrepresentation of vast amounts of data can allow for better understanding of\ntrends and events. The complex data processed through an analytics engine\nrequires advanced visualization software, as it cannot be presented in simple\ncharts and presentations.\n\n**7\\. They are available through a subscription model.** Subscription models\nof software as a service (SaaS) platforms are useful because they easily allow\nyou to access the latest upgrades in technology. They also eliminate the\nsignificant upfront expense of purchasing an analytics solution and may be a\nmore cost-efficient way of investing in analytics.\n\n## **So, Should You Invest in an HR Analytics Solution?**\n\nHR analytics offers some undoubted benefits. It allows HR teams to\nsignificantly streamline processes that reduce costs, reduce attrition, and\nconsequently improve the bottom line.\n\nWith task automation, you are freed up to innovate and explore the human\naspect of human resources without spending time on tracking mountains of data\nfrom multiple sources.\n\nOverall, the use of HR analytics has been established as an HR technology\ntrend for 2019, as it is posed to improve the employee experience that\ndirectly translates into improved business outcomes.\n\nHowever, it also presents some real challenges.\n\nAs Collins tells us, \u201cWhile HR is ambitious about the use of predictive HR\nanalytics, two HR leaders I recently spoke with said \u2018we want to be able to\npredict everything!\u2019 The vision for how analytics will become an HR core\ncompetency is being constrained by limited consumption (insights being shared\nonly within the four walls of HR) and action (the research does not lead to a\nprogram change or new investment). There is still much progress to be made.\u201d\n\nIn addition, because data is siloed across the organization and conversations\nabout the goal of implementing analytics are unclear, the valuable data HR\nrequires for analytics is often underutilized.\n\nThe challenge is in waiting to actually see results. Predictive analytics is\nlikely to take a minimum of 24 months to show meaningful results, but it will\nhelp get started with HR transformation.

\u2013 Recruitment and Applicant Tracking\nSystem in the 2019 HRM Asia Readers Choice Awards.\n\nBy: [Paul Howell](https://hrmasia.com/author/paul/ \"Posts by Paul Howell\") |\nDecember 6, 2019\n\nTopics: [Digital Transformation](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/digital-\ntransformation/) | [News](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/news/)

[Talent\nManagement](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/talentmanagement/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/TalentMind-RCA-pic.jpg)\n\nSho Kondo, Head of TalentMind, is still celebrating the company for its\nsuccess in the HRM Asia Readers Choice Awards. TalentMind was judged the Gold\nAward winner in the Best HR Tech \u2013 Recruitment and Applicant Tracking System\ncategory, providing an excellent recognition for his team and products.\n\n\u201cHaving the judges and readers evaluate us, and ultimately coming out tops, is\na great justification to the work that we\u2019re doing at TalentMind and AnyMind\nGroup - not just in developing such a powerful platform to help HR and\nrecruitment professionals scale their activities, but also in ensuring our\nclients are able to onboard the TalentMind platform to fit it seamlessly into\ntheir hiring efforts,\u201d he said. TalentMind was launched in January 2018, and\nhas quickly made an impact on recruitment markets across Asia.\n\n\u201cOur objective was to make the recruitment process much more efficient for HR\nprofessionals,\u201d Kondo said. \u201cThis has evolved into a more comprehensive\nplatform that includes an artificial intelligence-driven candidate screening\nfunction and applicant tracking system, but also a HR Information System \u2013\nempowering HR professionals with even more streamlined data utilisation,\ninsight, and action across recruitment and employee management.\n\nArtificial intelligence has only rarely been used in the recruitment function\npreviously, but Kondo says there are powerful applications if the data quality\nis there. \u201cThe beauty in what we\u2019re doing though is combining data points from\nemployees \u2013 including average tenure and performance \u2013 to better guide talent\nacquisition efforts,\u201d he says. \u201cThis provides a more comprehensive and data-\ndriven view into the wider span of HR.\n\n\u201cAt TalentMind, we believe that technology is a true enabler for HR\nprofessionals, reducing manual or mundane work and empowering users to focus\non more strategic aspects of their already vast work scope. Additionally,\nuseable data is no longer limited by geographical or departmental boundaries,\nproviding additional scale to what HR can achieve across the entire\norganisation.\u201d\n\nThe team from TalentMind were unable to join the Readers Choice Awards Gala\nCeremony on November 1, but were excited to receive the trophy at their office\na few days later.\n\n**TalentMind**\n\nTalentMind is a HR technology business and part of AnyMind Group. Through\nTalentMind's recruitment solution, HR professionals can make hiring more data-\ndriven and efficient. Leveraging on an AI-driven screening solution,\nTalentMind identifies and scores potential job candidates through their\nresume, social media and competency data, whilst learning the hiring manager's\npreferences.\n\nAll hiring activity is managed through a single TalentMind applicant tracking\nsystem. TalentMind has also just launched HR management system that manages\nemployee data, including attendance and absences, along with payroll.\n\n[www.talentmind.ai/](http://www.talentmind.ai/)\n\n  \n---  \n  \n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Freaders-\nchoice-2019-recruitment-and-applicant-tracking-system%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Readers+Choice+2019%3A+Recruitment+and+Applicant+Tracking+System&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Freaders-\nchoice-2019-recruitment-and-applicant-tracking-system%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Freaders-\nchoice-2019-recruitment-and-applicant-tracking-system%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

It can become impossible to find the right person for the job if\nyou don't first identify what the ideal candidate needs to succeed.\"\n\nCompetency-based selection is a process of evaluating candidates' behavioral\nattributes\u2014as well as their skills and knowledge\u2014by using role-based models\nand structured interviews to determine their fit for a position.\n\n\"You can hire for technical competencies all day long, but, if your new hires\ndo not align with the company's guiding principles and culture or the role's\nbehavioral competencies, you're setting them up for failure,\" said Michael\nGoldberg, managing director of MMGoldberg & Associates, an HR and talent\nacquisition consulting firm based in Dallas.\n\n\"Competency models are not one-size-fits-all, and they are very dependent on\nthe job in question,\" said Tara Gullans, industrial organizational\npsychologist at Caliper, an employee assessment and talent development company\nin Princeton, N.J. \"Hiring managers need to consider the outcomes they are\nlooking for in a certain position and then hire for competencies that will get\nthem to that outcome.\"\n\nGullans added that competency-based selection benefits the organization in\nvarious ways. Competency models can be incorporated into job descriptions to\nattract the right candidates for open positions. Recruiters and hiring\nmanagers use them to evaluate candidates in the selection process. And they\nserve as an employee's baseline for development later on. But they also\nbenefit the candidates themselves.\n\n\"The models add clarity and expectations for a role,\" she said. \"Candidates\nand new hires may want to know if there are certain aspects of the job where\nthey will thrive and others they may need to work on to succeed.\"\n\nLennon added that defining competencies for new hires can help set goals,\nidentify areas for professional development, make decisions about promotions\nand relocate employees in the case of an organizational restructuring.\n\n\"Ultimately, core competencies not only help hire the right people, but also\nensure they are well-equipped to do their job and fulfill their career\naspirations within your company,\" he said.\n\n _[SHRM members-only platform : _[_SHRM\nConnect_](https://community.shrm.org/home?_ga=2.268625778.206560651.1493167936-920689375.1491920969)\n_]_\n\nCreating New-Hire Competencies\n\nLennon said there are job-specific and organizational competencies to\nconsider. To identify job-specific competencies, think about what is required\nto complete the duties of the job, including hard and soft skills, knowledge\nin the field, and behavioral attributes and work style.\n\n\"Determining position-specific competencies will include the input of not only\nthe position's supervisor, but also other employees who work closely with the\nposition,\" he said.\n\nGullans said not to forget to talk to high-performing incumbents in the role.\n\"I want to hear from them what it is they do every day, what is important to\nthem about their job, what makes them successful,\" she said.\n\n\"Keep in mind that you're looking at the job as it is today. People get caught\nup in future potential, which is important to consider, but you don't want to\noverload a new-hire model with future-seeking competencies.\"\n\nOrganizational competencies will be consistent across all roles in a company,\nLennon said. They can be created by identifying norms and behaviors expected\nacross the company.\n\n\"Many of the organizational competencies will relate to the company's brand\nand values,\" he said. \"If your organization has codified its brand, values and\nculture, refer to these as a starting point to help you identify your\norganizational competencies.\"\n\nThat's the low-hanging fruit, Goldberg said. \"Most organizations have guiding\nprinciples, mission and value statements, but 90 percent of them aren't asking\ncandidates questions that align with those.\"\n\nExperts agreed that HR and talent acquisition should work together in\nspearheading competency creation through interviews, focus groups and survey\ndata collection.\n\n\"When creating a competency model, focus on the must-haves, while also noting\nthe competencies that would be nice to have or that you are willing to spend\ntime developing in your new hires,\" Gullans said. \"In a sales role, a must-\nhave would likely be the competency of influence and persuasion. A nice-to-\nhave could be about their time management skills, which might be an area that\nyou can help develop. If you're hiring for a leadership role, it's important\nfor hires to have a big-picture view, make tough decisions and think\nstrategically. A candidate may demonstrate high detail orientation and quality\nfocus, but is this a key competency? Not likely.\"\n\nShe provided the following examples of role-based competencies:\n\n  *  **Bank teller.** People in the role work with customers to complete account transactions. What does that mean in terms of competencies? \"There's a good amount of quality focus\u2014they are working with people's money, typing in numbers,\" Gullans said. \"Another competency is helpfulness, which captures the customer-facing aspect of their job. They must be friendly and able to take ownership of any issues that come up with customers. Following standard practices is important\u2014they are not being asked to be creative as a teller but instead follow strict transaction rules.\"\n  *  **Midlevel manager.** Important competencies would include being able to drive results, communicate performance expectations, delegate responsibility and manage process, Gullans said. From that point you can add in industry-specific requirements.\n\nUsing Competencies to Guide Interviews\n\nOnce you've created competency models for the role and the organization, the\nnext step is integrating the models into the candidate interview process.\n\"Identifying core competencies provides the basis for structuring effective\ninterviews,\" Lennon said.\n\nGoldberg added that recruiters and hiring managers should not just be\npassively asking questions during interviews and assessments but also have a\nway of scoring candidates' answers. \"Listen for what you know will work and\nwhat will not work.\"  \n\n[Communication](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Communication) [Critical\nEvaluation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Critical Evaluation) [External\nRecruiting](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=External Recruiting) [Talent\nAcquisition Communication](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Talent Acquisition\nCommunication) [Interviewing](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Interviewing)\n[Sourcing Strategies](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Sourcing Strategies)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Make+Better+Hires+with+Competency+Models&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/talent-acquisition/Pages/Make-Better-Hires-with-Competency-Models.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

management processes and procedures have evolved at a blistering\npace, perhaps faster than any other part of the Human Resources discipline.\n\nPM has transitioned from an industrial-age framework focused on maintaining\nconsistent production schedules and quality to a flexible \u2013 and interconnected\n\u2013 tracking, coaching and talent development tool.\n\nTechnology capabilities and limitations often drove process design in early\nPMS implementations.\n\nOrganizations now require technology solutions that reflect their specific\nperformance management framework and focus on the competencies that enable\ntheir unique strategy.\n\n### Aligning performance management with organizational strategy\n\nTo design an effective performance managemtn system, organizations need to\nunderstand how each job \u2013 and the career ladders or development paths for\nthose jobs - feed into the organization\u2019s strategic goals.\n\nThat understanding provides the framework for how and how often performance\nassessment and guidance is conducted.\n\nIt provides a way to assess performance not just in terms of \u201cwhat have you\ndone for me so far?\u201d but also, \u201cWhere can we best use your talents and\noptimize your skills going forward?\u201d\n\nWhy is that so important?\n\nEffective and[ engaged employees ](https://www.betterbuys.com/talent-\nmanagement/hr-engagement-retention/)share a couple of common characteristics,\nregardless of industry, job function, or seniority.\n\nThey understand how their daily efforts make a difference in whether and how\ntheir organization achieves its strategic goals.\n\nWithout that understanding, how can they to rate their own efforts and see\nwhere they should develop strengths and overcome limitations?\n\nAn effective performance management solution provides the tools to answer that\ndeceptively straightforward question for individual contributors, teams and\norganizations.\n\nAnd, like individual performance goals, a PM system design should flow from a\nclearly-defined strategy. Otherwise, those systems can limit, instead of\nadvancing, that strategy.\n\n### Asking the right questions\n\nOften, discussions about the need for performance management approach the\ntopic at a tactical level.\n\nIndeed, many vendors\u2019 websites suggest that customers look at tactical drivers\nwhen they are researching performance management tools.\n\nThey suggest organizations ask themselves,\" Why are we looking at investing in\na new PMS?\"\n\n    * Compensation decision making?\n    * Administrative support?\n    * Developmental planning and guidance?\n    * General performance measurement and reporting?\n\nFor nearly every organization, the answer is, \u201cYes, all of that.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that there's a growing ecosystem of performance management\ntechnology providers that support those core capabilities. And that\u2019s fine as\nfar as it goes.\n\nBut that is also a problem. In the end, those are questions about the tool\u2019s\ncapabilities, not about the competencies required to implement your strategy.\n\n### Strategy drives competencies, competencies drive PM\n\nStrategy is the expression of an organization\u2019s mission, goals, objectives and\ninterrelated action plans for achieving each of those targets.\n\nThose are the factors that determine what competencies you need to build,\nmaintain and nurture.\n\nMapping strategy components onto various functions \u2014 product development,\nproduction, marketing, sales, management and administration and partnerships \u2014\nhelps define and prioritize the tasks that you ask each of your people to\nperform.\n\nAnswering strategic performance management questions requires the customer,\nand solution provider, to understand how each job \u2013 and any associated\ndevelopment plans and career ladders -[\nfeed](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/how-hr-can-earn-that-elusive-seat-at-\nthe-c-suite-table/)[ ](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/how-hr-can-earn-\nthat-elusive-seat-at-the-c-suite-table/)[into the organization\u2019s strategic\ngoals.](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/how-hr-can-earn-that-elusive-seat-\nat-the-c-suite-table/)\n\nAn understanding of the competencies needed to support your strategic aims\nprovides a framework for defining jobs, assessing performance and guiding\nemployee development.\n\n### Shared understanding of why, what and how\n\nIf each of your processes flow directly from strategy, you can trace\neveryone\u2019s work (actions and behaviors) from task to outcome.\n\nThat allows everyone to see how their work combines with everyone else\u2019s to\nenable the organization\u2019s strategic ambitions.\n\nWhen everyone shares a strategy-based understanding of job responsibilities\nand interdependencies, they are empowered to hold themselves, and each other,\naccountable for outcomes.\n\nThey can see where changes and improvements in their jobs might better support\nstrategy. And they can anticipate and participate in realizing those changes.\n\n### Feedback and adjustment\n\nSo, if everything flows from strategy, is this a one-way, top down process?\n\nNo. Like any successful living organism, companies, government agencies,\ncharitable foundations or any other group enterprise operate in an infinite\n[series of feedback loops and adjustment\nmechanisms](http://blog.competencycore.com/2012/08/linking-performance-\nmanagement-corporate-strategy.html).\n\nDesigning a performance management structure and selecting the tools that can\nbest support that structure needs to be a similarly interactive process.\n\nPMS design needs to include ways to capture and consider input from all\nstakeholders ranging from senior executive management through to line\nmanagers, employees and unions and, in many cases, indirect input from end\ncustomers.\n\n### Are you optimizing people or processes?\n\nWhen companies were measuring how many acceptable widgets came off production\nLine B, and knew they\u2019d be making those widgets for the foreseeable future,\nperformance was easier to assess and to manage.\n\nEmployees weren\u2019t expected to change tasks on the fly, if at all. Training\nrequirements were well-defined and could focus on a few specific skills.\n\nToday, however, you need every employee ready to quickly learn new skills and\nperform new tasks to support an evolving strategy.\n\nManagers need visibility into how workers\u2019 capabilities fit with their current\njobs and insight into any talents and interests that would be valuable\nelsewhere.\n\nWorkers need to see how their skills fit with current tasks and what new\nskills they can and should develop to climb their chosen career ladder.\n\nThat means both managers and workers need a holistic view of current and\nfuture competency requirements.\n\nAnd there is a real payoff: the more of a role your employees play in\nrecommending and selecting [skills they want to\ndevelop](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/career-development-in-demand/),\nthe more excited they will be to use those skills.\n\n### Performance management is everyone's responsibility\n\nOf course, these highly complex and interdependent performance management\ntools and processes are only valuable if used consistently across your\norganization.\n\nHere again, tying the performance management process back to strategy makes it\nclear to all stakeholders just how critical it is.\n\nLeadership support for and continued attention to employee development sets\nthe tone, but ease of use plays a huge part in how effective PM processes and\ntechnology solutions are for the organization.\n\nEmployees and managers need to be able to learn and use PM systems without a\nmassive time investment that takes away from productivity.\n\nThat means organizations need to make learning and using performance\nmanagement processes and tools part of every job description.\n\nAnd organizations should push PMS providers to continually improve both user\ninterfaces and user training so those meet your specific needs.\n\n### Measuring performance management ROI\n\nPerformance management systems provide powerful tools for developing and\nnurturing competencies, making them among the most important investments an\norganization must make.\n\nUltimately, performance management that maximizes workforce development and\nflexibility in line with a strategic framework is what differentiates\nsuccessful and less successful organizations - even in the most highly-\nautomated industries.\n\nThe return on your performance management investment can be measured in\nfinancial terms reflecting increased efficiency, reduced turnover and other\nmetrics.\n\nBut the true measure of a successful PMS implementation is a flexible,\nteachable workforce that understands and supports your strategy and that has\nthe resources they need to succeed and grow with your business.  \n  \n\n![Tim\nMcElgunn](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Tim\nMcElgunn](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Tim\nMcElgunn](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/07/newtimart-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Tim McElgunn](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/tmcelgunn/)\n\nTim, a member of the HRMorning staff, is a veteran writer and editor.

Curriculum Guidebook and Templates\n\nThe SHRM Human Resource Guidebook is provided for any university that wants\nits HR curriculum aligned with SHRM\u2019s recommended minimum standards for\ndegree-based coursework in HR. The HR Curriculum Guidebook and Templates are\nbased on extensive research and is revalidated every three to five years. Over\ntime, it increasingly integrates the HR Competency Model components most\nrelevant to early-career HR professionals.\n\n  \n\nThe process to request analysis is free of charge to the university. For\nuniversities interested in becoming aligned, and included in[ SHRM\u2019s HR\nProgram Directory](/certification/for-organizations/academic-\nalignment/Pages/HR-Program-Directory.aspx), refer to the chapter entitled\n\u201cHaving Your University\u2019s HR Degree Program Analyzed for Alignment\u201d in the\n[SHRM Human Resource Curriculum Guidebook and Template](/certification/for-\norganizations/academic-\nalignment/Documents/2019%20Curriculum%20Guidebook%20Update_FNL.pdf).  \n\n  \n\n **Assessing Your University\u2019s HR Degree Program : Does it align with SHRM\u2019s\nguides?**  \n\n  \n\nTo increase flexibility, creativity and innovation to universities in\ndesigning HR curricula, the Guidebook identifies HR topics that should be\nrequired curriculum in an HR degree program, as well as additional HR topics\nto complement the required core. The sample course module templates identify a\nvariety of options to aid universities when developing courses that cover the\nHR content areas discussed in the guidebook.

[Nate\nDvorak](//www.gallup.com/people/item.aspx?a=167717)\n\n![Rethinking Competencies, Part 3: Is Your Program\nBroken?](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/mokwasrvweolp5sjikqvjw.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * The dream of competencies is laudable, but results are scarce\n  * Simple programs beat complex ones; developmental beats evaluative\n  * Effective competency programs identify emerging leaders\n\n_This article is the third in a series about rethinking competency behaviors,\nfeedback and programs._\n\nLeadership and management competencies are part of the organizational DNA of\nmodern business. Since the 1970s, competencies have offered the guiding\nprinciples of managerial excellence. Competencies were designed as a\nfoundation for people leader development, a means to generate value, a\nprecursor of organic growth, a guide to engineering consistent cultures -- and\neven as a part of compensation programs.\n\nIf only.\n\nSince their well-intended introduction, competencies have taken on a life of\ntheir own. Rather than serving as a set of must-have skills, many competency\nprograms have become a list of contradictory demands and subjective rationales\nthat can be used to justify almost anything.\n\nConfusing, demoralizing and only occasionally linked to employee development\nand organic growth, most leadership competency models have not created the\norganizational value that they were meant to.\n\nAnd because every leadership role demands its own competencies, each role --\nor sometimes, each leader -- requires a unique format. Running many different\ncompetency assessments for many different people with the input of many, many\n_other_ people takes a great deal of HR's time and energy, introduces rater\nbias, may expose companies to privacy issues, and may not identify the\nqualities proven to improve leadership performance.\n\nIt may also ruin your leadership pipeline.\n\n### **Examine Your Competencies Critically**\n\nGallup research shows that [91% of people who have recently changed\nroles](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/245480/why-need-compete-employees-\ncustomers.aspx) left their former company to do so, that the most talented are\nthe [likeliest to leave](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231641/talent-walks-\nwhy-best-employees-leaving.aspx), and that 87% of millennials and 69% of older\ngenerations say \"professional or career growth and development opportunities\"\nare [chief concerns in a\njob](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236438/millennials-jobs-development-\nopportunities.aspx).\n\nA competency model has to promote growth or it wastes HR's time and leaders'\npatience. But if the program is so confusing that it fails to attract and keep\ntalented people, it's creating a leadership vacuum for the future. So if your\nleaders raise their eyebrows at your company's must-have competencies, or your\nmust-haves don't seem to measurably affect their performance, it's time to\nrethink the model. Before you start, ask yourself these questions:\n\n  1. **Is your competency program too complicated?** Too many competencies on the list, too many competency models being used at the same time, too many measures and too many raters baffle leaders and managers about who is rating whom, on what, for what purpose -- and HR leaders can get lost in the weeds too. As a result, that overcomplicated program just confuses people and won't improve performance much.\n\n  2. **Does your program focus more on evaluation than development?** If most of your investment is spent on the upfront administration and reporting, and not on using the results for coaching, learning, growth and development, the focus is misplaced. An effective competency model [clearly connects results to learning and growth](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/267020/rethinking-competencies-part-feedback.aspx).\n\n  3. **Is your 360 used for rankings?** 360s are often used to rate or rank. That's not what 360s are for. That is what goals and performance management systems are for. The most effective use of multi-rater feedback is developmental, so if a 360 is used to evaluate performance rather than guide growth, it may miss the mark.\n\n  4. **Is your competency assessment dismissed as \"just a year-end thing\"?** Leadership competency acquisition must be measured at some point in time, of course, but if the assessment seems like a chore and the results aren't put to effective use (i.e., ongoing conversations with clearly defined goals and outcomes) the whole process can feel like a check-the-box exercise.\n\n### **The Right Model: Simple, Strengths-Oriented and Development-Focused**\n\nToo many \"yes\" answers to the questions above indicate that it's time to build\na new model. Gallup recommends basing it on the findings from a recent study\nof more than 550 job roles and 360 unique job competencies, which shows that\nnearly all competencies fall into seven dimensions ([everything from building\nrelationships to creating\naccountability](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/267017/rethinking-\ncompetencies-part-expectations-leaders.aspx)).\n\nUse those seven dimensions to develop _one_ model, and introduce variations\nwhen a role is quantifiably unique. One model is easier to create, administer,\ncommunicate and use in subsequent development.\n\nThat said, any model should reflect achievable, future-oriented performance\ngoals. And it should focus on what the leader is most capable of and what\nthey're naturally great at, rather than weaknesses the leader must fix.\nPredicating a review on strengths helps HR align learning and growth\nopportunities with the review _and_ the individual's areas of greatest\npotential.\n\nBut that's not enough. The program should communicate all coaching resources,\nindividual self-paced learning, cohort or classroom learning, and experiential\nopportunities that allow people to use the feedback as a starting point for\ndevelopment, not a summary or evaluation.\n\nA more simplified, strengths-oriented, development-focused performance review\ncomes a lot closer to the original vision for leadership competencies. And\nit's far likelier to achieve the outcomes that companies want -- the outcomes\nthey hire leaders to accomplish -- while increasing the capacities of the\nleaders they have.\n\nSo if your current competency program is at all contradictory, overly\ncomplicated or demoralizing, it is not doing what you need it to do. It should\nfill your leadership pipeline with emerging leaders who are learning and\ngrowing in their role. It should have a measurable positive outcome on\nperformance. It should create organic growth.\n\nIf it doesn't do those things, why bother with it at all?\n\n### **Most performance development programs simply don 't work. Build one that\ndoes.**\n\n  * Want to learn more about competencies?

strides in becoming more diverse\nand inclusive, news headlines demonstrate how far we still have to go before\nall employees have full opportunities to contribute and succeed and workforces\nreflect the demographics of society.\n\nThe #MeToo movement has spread far beyond the entertainment industry and has\nshed new light on the challenges women face in the workplace and why it\u2019s\nimperative that organizations establish strong policies to protect employees\nfrom negative behaviors.\n\nIn the wake of an incident at one location last year, Starbucks\u2014which scores\nhigh on D&I\u2014shut down all its stores for several hours on May 29 to conduct\nracial-bias training for its employees, an action that underscored the problem\nof unconscious bias in the workplace and throughout society.\n\nDespite their best efforts to become more diverse and inclusive, organizations\nsometimes are their own worst enemy. Companies as disparate as Papa John\u2019s\nPizza and Fisher Investments have experienced substantial business losses\nfollowing unacceptable remarks by their founders.\n\nThe negative headlines reflect a broader truth: workplace bias\u2014both overt and\nunconscious\u2014continues to impede the hiring, development and promotion of\nunderrepresented groups.\n\nAll told, workers filed over [76,000\ncomplaints](https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/4-10-19.cfm) with the\nU.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2018, with charges of\nretaliation accounting for just over 50% of complaints, followed by\ndiscrimination based on gender or sexual orientation, disability and race.\n\nA McKinsey report, _Women in the Workplace_ , which included input from 279\ncompanies, concludes that progress on gender diversity has stalled. For more\nthan 30 years, the report states, women have been earning more bachelor\u2019s\ndegrees than men. They\u2019ve been asking for promotions and negotiating salaries\nat the same rates as men. And, contrary to conventional wisdom, women are\nstaying in the workforce at the same rate as men.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nYet, despite all this, women continue to be underrepresented in all levels of\nmanagement.\n\nThe lack of progress is even more stunning in light of the overwhelming\nevidence that diverse companies are more productive, innovative and perform\nbetter financially. Studies show that diverse management teams:\n\n  * are 33% more likely to generate better-than-average profits;\n  * are 70% more likely to capture new markets; and\n  * generate 19% more revenue from innovation than companies with below-average leadership diversity.\n\nDiversity is no longer just a matter of regulatory compliance or even social\njustice. It\u2019s a clear and present business-performance issue. Organizations\nthat lag behind their competitors in diversity will find it more difficult to\nattract top talent, break into new markets, innovate and build a good\nreputation among employees, customer, and outside stakeholders.\n\n**World\u2019s Most Admired Companies**\n\nCompanies that are on the forefront in becoming more diverse and inclusive are\nmore effective at leveraging their efforts to drive business strategy and\nperformance.\n\nFor many years, Korn Ferry has produced a list of companies that are \u201cMost\nAdmired for HR\u201d for _Human Resource Executive_. Each year, we focus on a\nspecific best practice that distinguishes the best companies from the rest.\nThis year, appropriately, the focus is on diversity and inclusion.\n\nOur research showed that WMACs (scoring among the top three in their\nindustries in the _Fortune \u201c_ World\u2019s Most Admired Companies\u201d rankings) differ\nfrom their peers (companies also participating in the rankings but scoring\nlower) in several key areas:\n\n**WMACs hold leaders accountable for driving diversity and inclusion** : All\nleaders and line managers are expected to articulate the importance of\ndiversity and inclusion across the organization and to drive measurable\nresults in their business units and departments. WMACs view D&I achievements\nas a differentiating competency that aspiring leaders must possess to rise in\nthe organization.\n\nSeventy-four percent of WMACs say senior-leadership scorecards reflect a \u201creal\ncommitment\u201d to diversity and inclusion, compared with 66% at peer companies.\nSimilarly, 87% of WMACs view inclusive leadership as a differentiating\ncompetency, versus 79% at peer companies.\n\n**WMACs are more effective at connecting diversity and inclusion to business\nperformance:** WMACs link diversity and inclusion to the organization\u2019s\nmission, business strategy and performance goals. They view D&I as central to\nthe company culture and a significant driver of financial value.\n\nNinety percent of WMACs report that diversity and inclusion are an important\nstrategic focus\u2014versus 83% in peers\u2014and 73% of WMACs utilize metrics to\nmeasure and evaluate the impact of diversity and inclusion on business\nperformance, compared with 67% in peers.\n\n**Pay equity is a focus of WMACs:** Managing pay equity effectively builds\ntrust in leadership, increased engagement and reduces turnover. Inequities in\ncompensation, on the other hand, can lead to employee dissatisfaction and a\nhigher risk of litigation, union issues and shareholder disapproval.\n\nEighty percent of WMACs monitor pay equity globally, versus 77% of peers. By a\nslightly larger margin\u201477% to 72%\u2014WMACs analyze the root cause of pay-equity\ndisparities.\n\n**WMACs do a better job of mentoring and sharing diversity success stories:**\nOur research has shown that the primary driver of \u201cheadline\u201d pay gaps is an\nimbalance in the distribution of women and underrepresented groups across\nlevels, functions and sectors. Accordingly, the underlying challenge is\nbuilding talent pipelines. At organizations lagging in diversity,\ndevelopmental practices often perpetuate the existing make-up of the workforce\nrather than foster diversity. WMACs specifically target women and other\nunderrepresented groups for development.\n\nEighty-one percent of WMACs have formal developmental programs for women and\n77% for other underrepresented groups, compared with 73% and 71%,\nrespectively, at peer companies. Eighty-four percent of WMACs share female\nsuccess stories and 81% share success stories of other groups, versus 78% and\n74%, respectively, at peers.\n\n**WMACs embed diversity and inclusion throughout the organization:** To create\na truly diverse and inclusive organization, everyone must be involved. While\nit\u2019s the responsibility of top leaders and managers to set the tone and\nexample, all employees must understand the business case for D&I and embrace\ninclusion in everything they do.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nSeventy-eight percent of WMACs report they effectively communicate their D&I\nstrategy to the workforce, versus 73% of peers, and 82% say their D&I\ninitiatives are effective, against 74% of peers.\n\n**Building Sustainable Inclusion**\n\nInclusion allows organizations to maximize potential of their talent and\ndeeply engage with diverse customers. To build a truly inclusive organization,\ncompanies need to start by understanding the experiences of their diverse\nemployees and customers. They need to have strong inclusive leadership\ncapabilities at the top. Leaders need not only to role model inclusive\nbehaviors, they must also act as inclusion architects and design and build\norganizations for inclusion.\n\nIn addition, organizations need to focus on both structural and behavioral\ninclusion. In the same way that effective traffic flow requires both good\ndrivers and good infrastructure, effective inclusion requires both structural\n(processes, polices, practices and, increasingly so, algorithms) and\nbehavioral elements. This duality must be enabled by a shared responsibility\nbetween individuals and the organization. Individuals drive their development\nand performance, while the organization removes systemic barriers, ensures\nbias-free decision-making and purposefully builds equity across the entire\nemployee experience. Like any critical business area, D&I must be approached\nwith scientific and analytical rigor. Leaders\u2019 decisions and actions must be\ninformed by data, analytics and verifiable research; only then can\norganizations achieve measurable progress in addressing complex D&I challenges\nand opportunities.\n\n_Sustainable Inclusion_\n\n[![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/KornFerry2.12.9.19-700x394.png)](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/KornFerry2.12.9.19.png)\n\nNotably, WMACs\u2019 top three D&I objectives are building teams and talent\nprocesses that reflect markets and customers, optimizing team performance and\nenhancing their competitive advantage in the marketplace.\n\nTo help organizations understand where they are in their D&I maturity, we have\nbuilt a model that identifies five key dimensions of D&I efforts (Compliance,\nAwareness, Talent Integration, Operations Integration, Market Integration);\nthe benchmarks that must be met within each dimension; and the behavioral and\nstructural changes that are required to make their D&I achievements\nsustainable.\n\nEach of these five dimensions contains behavioral and structural inclusion\nelements. Behavioral-inclusion initiatives are intended to create inclusive\nmindsets, skill sets and relationships. Structural-inclusion initiatives are\nintended to build equitable and transparent structures, processes and\npractices that work for all employees and customers.\n\nWithin each of these dimensions, progress is plotted for both structural and\nbehavioral initiatives from basic to progressing to advanced to leading edge.\nAt the basic level, the D&I initiative is contained within a single department\nor function. At the leading edge, the initiative is fully embraced by the CEO,\nleadership team, managers and employees.\n\n_D &I Maturity_\n\n[![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/KornFerry1.12.9.19-700x489.png)](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/KornFerry1.12.9.19.png)\n\nHere is a brief description of what \u201cleading-edge\u201d success looks like for each\ndimension in our model:\n\n**Compliance:** The HR group, top leaders and the board proactively monitor\nD&I risk and enforce consequences for anyone\u2014regardless of their position\u2014who\nviolates organizational policies and values. Leaders and HR executives\neffectively deal with power dynamics and negative behaviors, and all employees\nfeel comfortable reporting abuses.\n\n**Awareness:** Diversity and inclusion is enshrined as a top leadership\npriority and a core value. Metrics are established to measure progress, and\nemployees are recognized for D&I achievements. Leaders passionately advocate\nfor D&I and consistently display inclusive behaviors. All employees take part\nin diversity and inclusion learning journeys.\n\n**Talent Integration:** Diversity and inclusion is fully integrated with the\ntalent-management strategy, including recruitment, employee development and\npromotions. Inclusive behaviors infuse the entire talent-management lifecycle\nand all key talent decisions. The organization builds relationships with\ndiverse professional groups to identify and recruit talented individuals.\n\n**Operations Integration:** Business leaders are responsible for integrating\ndiversity and inclusion in the operations ecosystem to improve performance,\ninnovation and problem solving. Leaders and managers role model inclusive\nleadership skills and make sure that teams are diverse and operate in an\ninclusive manner.\n\n**Market Integration:** Reaching out to diverse customers is considered part\nof the organization\u2019s brand. Diversity and inclusion is embedded in sales,\nmarketing and customer-service functions. Leaders and employees develop cross-\ncultural knowledge and competencies and display those skills both internally\nand when communicating with customers and partners.\n\n**Apple\u2019s Story**\n\nThe No. 1 company on our list of Most Admired Companies for HR, Apple\nComputer, provides a constructive example of how a committed leader can build\na more diverse and inclusive organization while at the same time fostering a\nculture of innovation and improving financial performance.\n\nWhen Tim Cook took over as CEO of Apple in 2011 from Steve Jobs, the major\nquestion on the minds of investors was how Cook could match the performance of\nSteve Jobs\u2014arguably one of the greatest innovators in business history.\n\nA passionate believer in diversity, Cook appointed three women to the\nexecutive team, recruited directors from underrepresented groups, transformed\nhiring practices and launched an [annual inclusion and diversity\nreport](https://www.apple.com/diversity/), which he shares with the public.\n\nSince 2014, the percentage of new hires at Apple who are female increased from\n31% to 36%, and the number of females among the under-30 age groups increased\nfrom 31% to 38%. While those numbers may seem modest, Apple is now considered\nat the top of the list for D&I within the tech sector. Other tech companies\nreportedly are following Apple\u2019s lead.\n\nApple\u2019s financial performance under Cook has been stellar. In 2018, Apple\nearned $265.6 billion, the highest annual revenue in the company's history.\nThe share price has gone from $53.39 when Cook took over to $249 in late 2019.\n\nApple\u2019s D&I progress\u2014in terms of numbers\u2014has been slow and steady. But it\u2019s\nclear that Cook has transformed the culture and elevated Apple\u2019s social brand.\n\nApple has proven that a thoughtful, genuine and sustained commitment to D&I,\nas well as full integration of D&I into talent and business practices,\nultimately will deliver results.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fhow-\nthe-worlds-most-admired-companies-drive-diversity-and-inclusion%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+the+world%E2%80%99s+most+admired+companies+drive+D%26I&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fhow-\nthe-worlds-most-admired-companies-drive-diversity-and-\ninclusion%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fhow-\nthe-worlds-most-admired-companies-drive-diversity-and-inclusion%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

[Josh Bersin](https://hrexecutive.com/author/josh-bersin/ \"Posts by Josh\nBersin\") | February 25, 2020 \u2022 4 min read\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/themes/riskandinsurance/avatars/468.png)\n\nJosh Bersin writes _HRE_ \u2019s HR in the Flow of Work column. Bersin is an\nanalyst, author, educator and thought leader focusing on the global talent\nmarket and the challenges and trends impacting business workforces around the\nworld. He recently spoke at the [HR Technology Conference in Las\nVegas](https://www.hrtechnologyconference.com/). He can be emailed at\nhreletters@lrp.com.\n\nTopics: [Career\nDevelopment](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/career-\ndevelopment-talentmanagement/) |\n[Columnists](https://hrexecutive.com/category/columnists/) |\n[Diversity](https://hrexecutive.com/category/diversity/) | [Diversity and\nInclusion](https://hrexecutive.com/category/diversity-and-inclusion/) |\n[Employee\nRecognition](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/employee-\nrecognition/) |\n[Engagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/engagement/) |\n[Performance\nManagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/performance-\nmanagement/) |\n[Recognition](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/recognition/)\n| [Talent\nAcquisition](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/talent-\nacquisition/) | [Talent\nManagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hpb/hpb-top-stories/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\nIn 2014, I wrote a speech titled \u201cSimply Irresistible\u201d that discussed the need\nto rethink employee engagement. Out of that speech came a research model\nexploring how meaningful work, sound management, an inclusive environment,\ncareer growth and leadership were all part of creating an irresistible work\nexperience.\n\nSince then, there has been a flood of new studies on employee experience, all\nof which have common takeaways: People want meaningful jobs, fair pay,\ntransparency, growth and, most of all, kindness.\n\n**New Research on Loneliness**\n\nI\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking about kindness in the workplace. At last\nyear\u2019s CHRO Summit at UC Berkeley, the Greater Good Science Center presented\nits research on happiness and wellbeing. The Berkeley faculty has found that\ncompassion, empathy, forgiveness, gratitude, mindfulness, social connection\nand awe are the most important things in our lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nFor me, this research was a wake-up call. I realized that, in the hundreds of\nmeetings I\u2019d conducted over two decades, I had never seen these words in\ncompany mission statements, competency models or leadership values.\n\nCigna recently published results from its _[U.S. Loneliness\nIndex](https://www.cigna.com/about-us/newsroom/studies-and-reports/loneliness-\nepidemic-america?WT.z_nav=newsroom%2Fnews-releases%2F2019%2Fcignas-us-\nloneliness-index-provides-actionable-insights-for-improving-body-and-mind-\nhealth;Body;U.S.%20%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20Loneliness%20Index)_ , which explores\nthe connection between physical health and emotional wellbeing. The survey\nresults are frightening: Fifty-two percent of Americans say they feel alone\nmost or all of the time, an increase of 6% over the last year. And 38% say\nthey \u201cdo not have close relationships with other people.\u201d The essence of the\nbook _Bowling Alone_ , published almost 20 years ago, has come true: We are\nliving in a world where social media, the internet, emails and TV dominate our\ntime\u2014leaving many of us unable to create meaningful relationships in our\nlives.\n\n  \n\nAnd, according to Cigna research, young people are the loneliest of all,\nperhaps exacerbated by job hopping. The Cigna research points out that the\nmore frequently we change jobs, the more likely we are to be lonely. It takes\ntime to build relationships at work, and when we leave positions, these\npersonal relationships often evaporate.\n\n**Anxiety** **and Stress**\n\nAt work, anxiety and stress are at all-time highs. I talk with HR leaders\nabout this almost every day, and most are bending over backward to understand,\nredesign and improve the employee experience as a result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nIn fact, IBM\u2019s [most recent study of skills\ngaps](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-09-06-IBM-Study-The-Skills-Gap-is-Not-a-\nMyth-But-Can-Be-Addressed-with-Real-Solutions) shows that stress management,\ntime management and the ability to deal with uncertainty are the most in-\ndemand skills. These power skills, as I call them, are not only complex in\nnature, they also center around being kind to others and ourselves.\n\n**In the Public Sphere, Kindness Seems Lacking**\n\nThere is also a sense of growing despair around us. Despite the growth in GDP\nand the stock market, this economic cycle has been unkind to many. As David\nLeonhardt recently wrote in the _New York Times_ , more than half of U.S.\nworkers have not seen wage growth for decades. In my city of Oakland,\nhomelessness is a terrible problem. My family and I spent time bringing food\nto homeless people this past holiday season, and I saw first-hand their cruel\nplight. Many had lost their jobs or had fallen ill and couldn\u2019t work. An\nexpression of kindness was an acknowledgement of their humanity.\n\n**The Role of HR**\n\nWe, as HR leaders and professionals, can help bring kindness into our\ncompanies. While the dimensions of the simply irresistible model are\nimportant, the human element is most important of all. Kindness means truly\ncaring about others, and acting and behaving in a kind and forgiving way. I\nurge you to consider a few things:\n\n  * Is your management rewarded for listening, caring and understanding people on the team?\n  * Does your company\u2019s culture allow people to make mistakes and then learn and grow from them?\n  * When your business slows, do you let people go or do you find a way to help them stay?\n  * Are your products and services kind to your customers, their families and the environment?\n  * Do people come to work feeling they can be themselves and they will be accepted for who they are?\n\nThese are not business or HR strategies, they\u2019re sound principles for life. As\nyou and your teams focus on employee retention, engagement and productivity,\nmake sure you bring the concepts of kindness, forgiveness and generosity to\nwork.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fjosh-\nbersin-kindness-the-missing-ingredient-in-a-great-employee-experience%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Josh+Bersin%3A+Kindness%E2%80%94What%27s+missing+in+a+great+employee+experience&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fjosh-\nbersin-kindness-the-missing-ingredient-in-a-great-employee-\nexperience%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fjosh-\nbersin-kindness-the-missing-ingredient-in-a-great-employee-experience%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

The organisation had just launched a refreshed\nvision, mission and values statement, in parallel with driving the\nrejuvenation of Mandai Precinct into an integrated nature and wildlife\ndestination.\n\nTasked with the agenda of inculcating these refreshed ideals, Heng spent the\nfirst 100 days getting to know the organisation, restructuring the HR\nfunction, understanding the competency gaps, and networking with the key\nstakeholders, which in WRS\u2019 case involved not just the HODs, but also two\nstrong unions. Today, WRS has a 1,200 employee-strong workforce (supported by\na bench of about 800 part-timers), and works passionately and tirelessly to\ninspire people to value and conserve biodiversity.\n\nIn this interview, Heng talks about the roll-out and achievements of the\nthree-year plan, which includes the journey into digitalisation, a career path\nfor zookeepers, flexible work arrangements for front-facing staff, and more.\n\n### Q WRS is managing four zoological parks, as well as the corporate office\nspace \u2013 what is the culture and how do you maintain it uniformly throughout\nyour properties?\n\nThe common thread here is that we\u2019re a strong community of people sharing the\nsame passion to protect wildlife. The culture is family-oriented, and defined\nby collaboration, teamwork, and inclusiveness. Sharing a common purpose and\npassion brings people together.\n\nIn providing staff meals, teams dine in a family-oriented way. Major festivals\n(usually riding on the town halls) are celebrated together, so the feeling of\ntogetherness is evident across the parks, and we are looking forward to the\nJurong Bird Park team moving over to Mandai in 2022.\n\nOur approach and communication towards this culture has always been very\nconsistent. The philosophy is strongly anchored by the leadership. The\nmanagement truly walks the talk, for example, every Sunday, one member of the\nsenior management team is on duty in one of the parks, as well as on Friday\nnights at the Night Safari. In this way, they not only appreciate what\nemployees are doing, but at the same time, understand the challenges they\u2019re\nfacing in delivering the guest experience. Additionally, on May Day last year,\nwe instituted a Management Action Day, where the management team was assigned\nto help out on the front line.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/05103528/Aditi-Feb-2020-Marcus-Heng-WRS-GS-shoot.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Q You\u2019ve progressed quite a bit since you launched the refreshed vision\nand mission. How have employees adapted to this new way of life?\n\nOur vision is to protect the wildlife and we do that in a lot of ways. For\nexample, we used to sell bottled water, but we have since stopped and put\nwater dispensers around the park. Yes, that impacted our revenue, but that\nsays something about holding true to our organisational beliefs.\n\nTaking another example, in the first year of the roll-out, we organised a\nseries of team-building programmes to help everyone align to the new values.\nFor an organisation with 60% of operational staff, can you imagine the\nlogistics to get everyone out for team-building?\n\nEvidently, when the organisation walks the talk, it makes an impact on the\nemployees as well. We have also aligned the new values to the performance\nappraisal, which allows us to measure the values that are being exhibited and\nthe areas in which they need to improve. All such actions allow us to embed\nthe values in everything that we do.\n\nWe\u2019ve been able to measure the impact through our biannual employee engagement\nsurveys, which show our employees are strongly aligned to the new mission,\nvision and values. Also, among our several conservation projects, we find\nstaff themselves volunteering to help out. From the participation rate of such\nprojects, it is clear they have subscribed to the organisational philosophy.\n\n### Q What do the surveys show are some of the things that employees love, and\nareas where you can improve?\n\nThe employees love the work conditions and environment. It\u2019s truly an open\noffice like no other. People are friendly, collaborative, and treat everyone\nwith respect. So teamwork emerged as one of our strongest themes. Another area\nthat really stood out is our brand. As a world-leading zoological institution,\nemployees feel proud associating with us.\n\nEngagement levels are high and people say they want to stay in the\norganisation. These are some of our strongest points according to this year\u2019s\nsurvey, where we got a 92% response rate from our team of about 1,200 full-\ntimers.\n\nThings that we could do better are the processes. The Bird Park, Zoo, Night\nSafari, and River Safari have been around for 49 years, 47 years, 26 years,\nand six years respectively. It\u2019s time for us as an organisation to look at how\ntechnology can enhance and streamline our processes, while helping us strike a\nbalance between governance and efficiency. So, we have embarked on an IT\nmaster plan to digitalise our journey to transformation.\n\n> ##### E-learning is very impactful for us because, with 60% of our workforce\n> made up of operational staff, sometimes it\u2019s impossible to get them away for\n> even two days.\n\n### Q Talk us through your journey towards digitalisation so far.\n\nIn November 2018, we commenced our five-year plan capturing the technology\npath we want to go down on. With new parks, attractions and developments\ncoming up, we wanted to look at the processes that could use technology to\nmake things more efficient.\n\nExternally, that means we are looking at leveraging technology to enhance the\nguest experience. Internally, our objective is for employees to experience\ndigitalisation for themselves before they can go and talk about it.\n\nWe\u2019ve brought a new HR integrated system on board, and have incorporated the\ntalent management and succession management modules for a start. We have also\ngone electronic for appraisals and learning. E-learning is very impactful for\nus because, with 60% of our workforce made up of operational staff, sometimes\nit\u2019s impossible to get them away for even two days. With this bite-size-\nlearning, they can do it anytime.\n\nWe have also rolled out on-the-job training (OJT) and our Zookeeper Competency\nFramework \u2013 all online. All the way from being trained, coached, assessed and\npassing the module, none of it is done on paper. We have also digitised the\nleave application. So be it applying for leave or doing your claims, employees\nonly need to use the app, effective early 2020.\n\nAnother thing we\u2019ve done is started using Yammer as a platform to communicate\nwith staff. No longer do they need to use emails while they are busy preparing\ncoffee for guests. As part of our outreach, we post company news, form\ncommittees based on interest groups, and more.\n\nAs for the management, they no longer have to approach HR to access employee\ninformation in their department. Everything is available digitally \u2013 right\nfrom staff profiles, to their performances, goals, and individual development\nplans (IDP).\n\n### Q How has using technology made an impact on productivity?\n\nOnce everything goes online, we don\u2019t need to pass papers around anymore,\nlooking for supervisors to sign things. We\u2019ve already saved so much time and\ngained convenience!\n\nFor employees, on the appraisal and career development front, everything is\naccessible right from IDPs to competency planning. Zookeepers can know exactly\nwhat their competency level is and what they need to learn in order to\nprogress to the next level of competency, for example.\n\nFor the HR team, it means we are no longer spending time chasing and\nprocessing forms. We\u2019ve designed the system not on the basis of current\nprocesses, but on the basis of the most efficient way of doing things. This\nallows us to take away things that add no value to processes.\n\nPut all of this together and so much time has been freed up for people to do\nmore value-added work. We have measurements in place to track progress\ndigitally, such as the completion rates for the appraisal forms, which were\nhard to track while we were still chasing paper forms.\n\n### Q You believe very much in self-directed learning. Tell us how the\nZookeeper Development Programme adds to that strategy.\n\nThis programme is unique because there is no public institution in Singapore\nthat prepares people for the profession of zookeeper. We train employees from\nscratch. We built this programme in-house in 2018, when we first got the\nmanagement and curators from the zoology side to identify the core\ncompetencies that are needed for each level, starting from junior zookeeper to\nzookeeper to senior zookeeper. There was a lot of involvement from the line as\nwell because they know well the kind of competencies that are needed.\n\nWe went on to identify 15 core competencies, about 40 sub-competencies, and\nabout 400 skill sets that are needed for career progression over four to five\nyears, thus giving our employees complete clarity over their career. In\nparallel, we also came up with about 1,800 tasks in the Zookeeper OJT\nBlueprint.\n\n> ##### It is indeed a resource-intensive project, but ultimately it\u2019s for the\n> greater good of employees.\n\n### Q Did you face any challenges in implementing this unique framework?\n\nOne of the challenges when you implement something like this is to ensure\nenough communication goes out and all questions are responded to. For example,\npeople asked if they needed to cross all the core competencies before they\ncould be promoted, or what happens if someone was quite senior in age, but not\ntech-savvy. These were some of the key union and management concerns we\naddressed. So the overarching goal was to give employees the assurance that\nthis programme was for their development.\n\nThe other challenge was in ensuring our coaches and assessors were ready. We\nneeded to equip them with the skill sets to coach and train. Some already had\nthe skill sets, but were not confident enough to coach, so we worked side-by-\nside with them. It is indeed a resource-intensive project, but ultimately it\u2019s\nfor the greater good of employees.\n\n### Q Let\u2019s talk about the flexible working arrangements (FWAs) \u2013 how did you\nimplement those in such a roster-based industry?\n\nWe are frontrunners in implementing FWAs in the tourism, attractions and\nhospitality industry. In 2018, we looked at our current and future workforce,\nand recognised that one of the things they really value is work-life.\n\nNow, the typical view is that work-life balance is not really possible in this\nindustry where we\u2019re typically open 365 days a year and almost 24 hours a day\n(taking the Night Safari into account). But it\u2019s up to us to challenge the\nnorm. So we decided to explore the programmes available, and then customise\nthose to suit our context.\n\nOur next challenge was the fear that only a few people would benefit from this\n\u2013 the corporate staff yes, but the staff on the operations side might feel a\nbit shortchanged. So our aim was to ensure that our programme must benefit as\nlarge a population as possible.\n\nWe then went out and did an intensive stakeholder engagement campaign \u2013 lots\nof focus groups and any opportunities to understand our options.\n\nWe then launched telecommuting, flexible working hours, and staggered work\nhours. We also came up with the Blue Skies policy \u2013 wherein we encourage\nemployees to clock in 15 minutes extra from Monday-Thursday, and leave an hour\nearlier every Friday, when the sun is still shining and the sky is blue! It\nbecame so popular because policies like these make the weekend seem longer and\nbring happiness to the workforce. We first launched it on a trial basis for\nthree months, and it has now been a year since it has been implemented.\n\nNot forgetting the operations staff, we started looking at a five-day workweek\nroster, instead of the five-and-a-half-day workweek. We worked with the line\nmanagers to adjust the rosters and achieve optimal outcomes. We also have the\nbenefit of leaning on our flexi-workforce of part-timers to support us for\nsuch programmes.\n\nHowever, while we were able to implement FWAs for four sections of the front-\nfacing operations staff, we still haven\u2019t found a way to make it work for the\nF&B staff. What we have done, though, is communicated this well enough and\naddressed the reason for this with the staff and unions, with F&B being such a\nmanpower-intensive industry and Singapore facing a nationwide shortfall.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nExpert Panel, Forbes Human Resources Council\n\nSuccessful HR executives from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) offer leadership and management\ninsights.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nBusinesses tend to take on a personality of their own. As most individuals who\nwork in human resources can attest, company culture is as much a personality\nof a business as it is the way the organization operates.\n\nIf left to its own devices, company culture can become unmanageable very\nquickly. At worst, it can lead to high worker turnover and poor employee\nmotivation. It's generally up to the HR department itself to guide the\ncompany's culture into being more cooperative and beneficial and less toxic.\n\nBelow, 13 professionals from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) take a look at the ways that an HR\ndepartment can partner with stakeholders to bring positive company culture to\na business, and why these methods are essential to a company's development.\n\nMembers explain how HR leaders can encourage the development of a strong,\ncohesive company culture.\n\nPhotos courtesy of the individual members.\n\n**1\\. Partner With The CEO  **\n\nThe CEO is the lifeblood of the organization where the culture flows into the\ncompany. HR should partner with the CEO and be regarded as a partner in\nreturn. Sustainable cultures are rich and compliant. The values, beliefs and\ngoals of the organization must correlate to compliance standards, including\nacceptance of diversity and inclusion. HR can help navigate complexities to\nfoster great culture. -[ Christine\nWzorek](https://twitter.com/christinewzorek),[ White Label\nAdvisors](https://www.whitelabeladvisors.com/)\n\n**2\\. Interview For Culture Fit  **\n\nDuring interviews is a great time to assess culture fit. A great way to do\nthis is to ask behavioral competency questions that align and support the\ncompany's core values, mission and vision statements. This is a way to be\nstrategic and proactive in your approach to finding the right fit! -[ Adam\nMellor](https://twitter.com/AdamCMellor),[ ONE Gas,\nInc.](http://www.onegas.jobs/)\n\n**3\\. Model And Reinforce Key Behaviors  **\n\nCompanies with great cultures have key behaviors or norms that the majority of\nemployees demonstrate. HR should not only demonstrate these but also help\nmanagers identify when someone on their team is not demonstrating these. Then\nthey should work with the manager to coach the employee to help demonstrate\nthose key behaviors. - [Jennifer\nDill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-d-418559145),[ Data Innovations\nLLC](http://www.datainnovations.com/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only organization for HR\nexecutives across all industries. _**Do I qualify?**_\n\n**4\\. Demonstrate You Value Your People  **\n\nEmployees want to work in a culture that demonstrates they are appreciated and\nvalued. HR organizations should introduce values and initiatives that\ncontinually support and drive those types of behaviors. Creating a great\ncompany culture results in higher productivity, lower attrition and greater\nemployee engagement. This also leads to greater customer satisfaction. -[\nCharles Ashworth](https://twitter.com/CIAshworth),[\nCopper](https://www.copper.com/)\n\n**5\\. Ask The Team  **\n\nEmployee engagement surveys are a great, cost-effective way to gain insight\ninto how the employees feel about the company culture. This feedback can be a\ncritical tool in determining whether the HR department is on the right track,\nor if an area needs to be course corrected. The simple act of asking the\nemployees what they think goes a long way in supporting a positive company\nculture. - [Melinda Godfrey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melinda-godfrey-phr-\nshrm-cp-59b81540/),[ Seakeeper, Inc.](http://www.seakeeper.com/)\n\n**6\\. Foster A Culture Of Respect  **\n\nThe common denominator of every great company culture is respect. Employees\nshould feel respected by co-workers, managers, C-level executives and vice\nversa. HR should display respect for employees by addressing issues and\ncomplaints in a timely manner. When respect is demonstrated from the top of\nthe company down, it will reflect in employee satisfaction and engagement. -[\nJohn Feldmann](https://twitter.com/john_feldmann),[\nInsperity](http://www.insperity.com/)\n\n**7\\. Create An Employee-Only Committee  **\n\nThis is something we practice ourselves -- we are growing and with that the\nculture shifts and grows with us. By having an employee committee, I am able\nto be proactive in our growth by talking with peers on things to do in the\noffice for creating a positive culture for everyone. Keep it simple -- limit\nthe number of people on the team, meet often and talk about wellness, fun and\ngrowth. -[ Kelly Loudermilk](https://twitter.com/yourHRsource),[ BuildHR,\nInc.](http://www.yourhrsource.com/)\n\n**8\\. Develop A Listening Strategy  **\n\nDevelop and deploy a comprehensive listening strategy. Everyone has an opinion\non culture, but the only one that matters is the collective opinion of the\nworkforce. Go beyond the annual engagement survey to more of an \"always-on\"\nfeedback mechanism to truly understand how employees feel about the existing\nculture, and gather their ideas on what needs to change to be prepared for the\nfuture. - [Kevin Oakes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinoakes),[ Institute\nfor Corporate Productivity (i4cp)](http://www.i4cp.com/)\n\n**9\\. Diversify And Engage  **\n\nHR departments can't overlook company culture in favor of day-to-day minutiae.\nBy bringing in diverse candidates who share similar values to those of the\ncompany, HR can foster a great community. HR teams can also develop engagement\nprograms to better integrate employees, survey their attitude toward the\ncompany and provide avenues to continually explore and expand on the\norganization's values. -[ Rachel\nLyubovitzky](https://twitter.com/rlyubovitzky),[\nEverythingBenefits](http://www.everythingbenefits.com/)\n\n**10\\. Recognize Achievements  **\n\nToo often, we move through the weeks and months without recognizing employees\nfor their achievements. Take time to tell your employees specifically why they\nare being recognized, and make sure their peers see that they are acknowledged\nfor their hard work. This builds morale, improves the culture and shows\nappreciation in a sustainable way. -[ Greg\nFurstner](https://twitter.com/gfurstner),[\nSkillPath](http://www.skillpath.com/)\n\n**11\\. Build Relationships  **\n\nEmployees look forward to coming to work if they know they are going to be\nspending time with people they like! They are also more likely to have a good\nattitude when they are on the job because everyone around them is a friend.\nThis positive attitude means employees communicate more effectively, learn to\nrely on and trust each other. In short, they work better together and get more\ndone. - [Gina Deciani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gina-deciani-32a0b5a),[\nAssociation for Supply Chain Management](http://www.ascm.org/)\n\n**12\\. Ensure Two-Way Communication  **\n\nHR should be the facilitator of company culture, but it can't start and stop\nin HR. Executive management's messages must set the tone and reflect hallmarks\nof the culture. These should coordinate with vision and values statements but\ngo further to bring them to life with applicable examples. There also needs to\nbe a way for all employees to participate so they feel ownership in spreading\nthe message. - [Dan Fries](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danfriessibson),[\nSibson Consulting](http://www.sibson.com/)\n\n**13\\. Hold People Accountable  **\n\nHR can hold leadership and staff alike accountable for the culture. When\nbehavior does not match the values, it should be called out. HR should also be\nhiring for culture and bring people in who embody the values of the\norganization. -[ Lotus Buckner](https://twitter.com/lotusbuckner),[\nNCH](http://www.nch.org/)\n\n[![Forbes Human Resources Council](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/assets/images/avatars/blog-4332_400_ca7d92be72a8ef01cadb837abca3e5f4.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/\n\"Photo of Forbes Human Resources Council\")\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only, fee-based organization\nfor senior-level human resources executives across all industries.

This helps managers revise or replace metrics as\ncircumstances change.\n\nManagers may push back against the added work, which involves planning,\nconducting reviews and documentation, but \"HR can help to keep managers on\ntrack,\" Spake said, by showing managers how their departments and the\norganization can benefit from discovering and remedying issues that hinder\nemployee performance.\n\nHR can also train managers to give \"impromptu feedback tailored in a way\nthat's helpful, not hurtful, and to remember that guidance is a gift, not a\nwhip.\" When pointing out problems or mistakes, use such language as \"that's\nwrong,\" not \"you're wrong,\" he noted.\n\nThese performance conversations can complement another performance management\ntrend: ratingless evaluations, Spake said.\n\nJettisoning formal employee ratings \"sometimes just leads to 'shadow ratings'\nbehind the scenes, with less transparency,\" he said. However, there are also\ngood reasons to do away with ratings, he continued. For instance, in the\ncommon ranking of 1 to 5, too often, the number an employee receives becomes\nthe center of the discussion, which eclipses more-productive conversations,\nlike how to improve performance.\n\n\"Establish a clear line of sight between performance and total rewards, even\nwithout ratings,\" Spake said.\n\nHe also suggested breaking up annual bonuses, such as paying them quarterly\ninstead of annually, so they are paid out closer to the performance that's\nbeing rewarded.\n\n_[SHRM members-only how-to guide : _ [ _How to Establish Salary\nRanges_](/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/how-to-\nguides/pages/howtoestablishsalaryranges.aspx) _]_\n\nEnsure Variable Pay Success\n\nTraditional merit-based pay systems often reward mediocre performance, whereas\na variable pay strategy rewards those employees who add the most value to the\norganization, said John A. Rubino, SHRM-SCP, founder and president of Rubino\nConsulting Services, a global human resources consulting company, during a\nJune 24 concurrent session at the conference.\n\nMost annual base pay increases in the U.S. have been in the 2.8 percent to 3.1\npercent range, \"which is no way to reward your best and brightest employees,\"\nRubino said.\n\n\"Stop pretending that you're paying for performance with base pay\nadjustments,\" he advised. The alternative is a variable pay program, with lump\nsums based on performance. Variable pay increases make it easy to see the link\nbetween results and rewards, but \"putting in place broad-based variable pay\nrequires a culture change within organizations. Some are ready for variable\npay, some are not,\" Rubino said.  \n\n\"Base pay provides a compensation baseline, for expected and predictable\nperformance improvement,\" he added. Salaries, however, grow exponentially, so\nthat each increase raises the base on which future increases are pegged.\n\"Slowing down base pay growth can at least partially fund variable pay\nprogram,\" Rubino said.\n\n\"Salary increases should be based on market value of jobs, determined by\ncomparative position analysis,\" he noted. Salary increases then become market\nadjustments.  \n\n\"Don't go down the road of variable pay until you can ensure that your\nperformance management system works,\" Rubino advised. That's because variable\npay draws on performance management metrics to determine targeted plan\npayouts.  \n\nAll employees can be included in a broad-based variable pay program, with\n[performance payouts often weighted by employee level](/hr-today/news/hr-\nnews/conference-today/Pages/2017/Evolving-Company-Culture-from-Base-Pay-to-\nComprehensive-Variable-Rewards.aspx#variable-pay). For most organizations,\nvariable payouts can range from 8 percent to 19 percent of base pay,\ndetermined by meeting individual, team and organization goals, but often these\nare paid only if the company achieves or overachieves its goals.  \n\n\"Specify what behaviors you want from employees, and structure the program\naround them,\" he said. \"Articulate what outstanding behavior is, and build it\ninto your metrics.\"\n\nInvite employees to write their own goals, aligned to business unit and\norganizational goals, Rubino recommended. Whether metrics are quantifiable\nhard measures or not, the criteria must be valid and discernable.\n\nTo avoid manager subjectivity or biases, use a rating system that solicits\nfeedback from multiple vantage points.  \n\nLike Spake, Rubino noted that employees are motivated by payouts timed close\nto the performance being rewarded. \"Consider paying semiannually or quarterly\nif all performance measures can be accurately evaluated within those time\nframes,\" he advised.  \n\n\"Top performers love variable pay. Your mediocre employees will not. Variable\npay will result in [an increase in] voluntary departures by mediocre employees\nwho just get by and who don't want to play by these rules.\"\n\nHe added, \"Be prepared for turnover when you change the culture.\"\n\nRubino warned, \"You can't change the culture of compensation from the HR\ndepartment.\" Adopting a variable pay approach \"must be supported by top\nleaders on down.\" HR, however, \"can catch the ear of senior executives\" and\nencourage them to get behind a variable pay strategy.  \n  \n\n**Related SHRM Articles :**\n\n[Employers Try Better Ways to Measure and Reward\nPerformance](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/compensation/Pages/better-ways-\nmeasure-reward-performance.aspx), _SHRM Online_ , August 2017  \n\n[Evolving Company Culture from Base Pay to Variable Rewards](/hr-\ntoday/news/hr-news/conference-today/pages/2017/evolving-company-culture-from-\nbase-pay-to-comprehensive-variable-rewards.aspx), _SHRM Online_ , June 2017  \n\n[Compensation Strategy and\nPlanning](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Compensation Strategy and Planning)\n[Critical Evaluation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Critical Evaluation)\n[Variable Pay](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Variable Pay)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Continuous+Evaluation+and+Variable+Pay+Are+Transforming+Company+Cultures&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/compensation/Pages/continuous-evaluation-and-variable-pay-transform-\ncompany-cultures.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

They quickly\nembraced what Ralph Hamers, CEO of the global banking group ING, calls\n\"banking on the go.\"\n\nBy 2014 about 40% of all interactions with ING retail customers were coming in\nthrough mobile apps. (Now the figure is closer to 60%--and branch visits and\ncalls to contact centers have dropped below 1%.) Even then mobile customers\nexpected easy access to up-to-date information whenever and wherever they\nlogged in. For instance, someone who started a loan transaction during the\ntrain ride home from work wanted to be able to continue it on a desktop that\nnight. \"Our customers were spending most of their online time on platforms\nlike Facebook and Netflix,\" says Hamers. \"Those set the standard for user\nexperience.\"\n\nThat meant ING needed to become nimbler and more user-focused to serve its 30\nmillion-plus customers across the world at every point in their financial\njourneys. So Hamers worked with Nick Jue, then the CEO of ING's Netherlands\ngroup, to launch a pilot transformation in the headquarters of ING's largest\nunit, its Dutch retail operations. The first step was to help other senior\nleaders and the board envision a new agile, team-based system for deploying,\ndeveloping, and assessing talent. (ING had already adopted agile and scrum\nmethodologies in its Dutch IT unit, but those ways of working were new to\nother parts of the organization.) Hamers and his leadership team then met with\npeople at tech companies they admired, learning how their talent systems\nenabled better customer service. By the spring of 2015 the headquarters of ING\nNetherlands, home to some 3,500 full-time employees, had replaced most of its\ntraditional structure with a fluid, agile organization composed of _tribes,\nsquads,_ and _chapters._\n\n#### Tribes, Squads, and Chapters\n\nING's new agile system for deploying talent and managing performance organizes\npeople by domain, customer need, and function. After experimenting with this\nstructure in its Dutch retail unit, the company decided to roll it out more\nbroadly.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_TRIBES.png)\n\nThirteen tribes were created to address specific domains, such as mortgage\nservices, securities, and private banking. Each tribe contains up to 150\npeople. (Employees in sales, service, and support functions work outside this\nstructure--in smaller customer-loyalty teams, for instance--but they\ncollaborate with the tribes.) And each has a lead who establishes priorities,\nallocates budgets, and ensures that knowledge and insights are shared both\nwithin and across tribes.\n\nThe tribe lead has one other critical responsibility: to create, with input\nfrom tribe members, self-steering squads of nine or fewer people to address\nspecific customer needs by delivering and maintaining new products and\nservices. These squads are cross-disciplinary--typically, a mix of marketing\nspecialists, data analysts, user-experience designers, IT engineers, and\nproduct specialists. One squad member is designated the \"product owner,\"\nresponsible for coordinating activities and setting priorities. The squad\nstays together as long as is required to meet the customer need from start to\nfinish--whether it is, for example, improving user experience on the mobile\napp or building a particular feature. Some tasks are completed in two weeks;\nothers might take 18 months. Sometimes the squads disband and the members join\nother ones. Most often, however, squads that are working well stay together\nand move on to address other customer needs.\n\nBy working in such small units and with colleagues from various disciplines,\nsquad members can quickly resolve issues that might previously have bounced\nfrom department to department. Information sharing is encouraged through\nmechanisms such as scrums and daily stand-ups--the kinds of gatherings you'd\nfind at a tech start-up. Seeing a project through from start to finish gives\neach squad a sense of ownership and connection to the customer.\n\nImplementing an agile talent system doesn't mean embracing chaos. In fact, a\nsystem that's well designed observes clearly defined rules and safeguards to\nensure institutional stability. Every tribe, for example, has a couple of\nagile coaches to help squads and individuals collaborate effectively in an\nenvironment where employees are encouraged to solve problems on the ground\nrather than pass them on to someone else. Although you might think adapting\nwould be most difficult for long-term bank employees, that's not so, according\nto ING Netherlands CIO Peter Jacobs. Many of them \"adapted even more quickly\nand more readily than the younger generation,\" he says, perhaps because their\nexpertise now has more impact than in the past, when so many sign-offs were\nrequired.\n\nWorking in small, cross-functional units, squads can resolve issues quickly.\n\nThen there are the chapters, which coordinate members of the same discipline--\ndata analytics, say, or systems processes--who are scattered among squads.\nChapter leads are responsible for tracking and sharing best practices and for\nsuch things as professional development and performance reviews. Think of\nchapters as a way of retaining the helpful parts of traditional management\neven while dispensing with time-consuming handoffs and bureaucracy.\n\nRegular assessments are built into the system. Every two weeks squads review\ntheir work. Says Hamers, \"They get to decide how they will continue to improve\nthe product for our customers, or if they want to 'fail fast.'\" (Learning from\nfailure is applauded.) Squads also do a thorough self-assessment after\ncompleting any engagement, and tribes perform quarterly business reviews\n(QBRs), looking at their biggest successes and failures, reviewing their most\nimportant learnings, and articulating goals for the next three months.\n\nThese safeguards help counter what Vincent van den Boogert, the current CEO of\nING Netherlands (and part of the team that launched the new organizational\nstructure), sees as the two biggest challenges of a squad-based system. One is\nthe possibility that self-empowered squads responding primarily to the needs\nof customers might embark on changes that aren't in sync with company\nstrategy. The QBRs mitigate that risk. The second challenge is somewhat\ncounterintuitive. Self-evaluating squads are sometimes content with the\nincremental improvements they make every two weeks. The QBRs help in that\nregard, too, because top management uses them to formulate and reinforce\nstretch goals.\n\nMore than two years in, Hamers considers the talent experiment a big success.\nCustomer satisfaction and employee engagement are both up, and ING is quicker\nto market with new products. So the bank has started to roll out this new way\nof working to the roughly 40,000 employees outside its home country. For\nHamers, the change can't come soon enough. The apps for each of ING's 13\nretail markets vary in appearance, design, and function. Hamers wants to make\nthings much simpler so that any customer, anywhere, will encounter the same\nING. \"Tech companies have one platform across the globe,\" he says. \"No matter\nwhere you use Netflix, Facebook, or Google, you get the same service. ING must\ndo the same. That is the only way we will bring all our customers along into\nthe future of banking.\"\n\n## HR Goes Agile\n\n  * [Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter%20cappelli)\n  * [Anna Tavis](/search?term=anna%20tavis)\n\n  * __Save\n  * __Share\n\nAgile isn't just for tech anymore. It's [been working its way into other areas\nand functions](/2016/05/embracing-agile), from product development to\nmanufacturing to marketing--and now it's transforming how organizations hire,\ndevelop, and manage their people.\n\nYou could say HR is going \"agile lite,\" applying the general principles\nwithout adopting all the tools and protocols from the tech world. It's a move\naway from a rules- and planning-based approach toward a simpler and faster\nmodel driven by feedback from participants. This new paradigm has really taken\noff in the area of performance management. (In a [2017 Deloitte\nsurvey](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/lu/Documents/human-\ncapital/lu-hc-2017-global-human-capital-trends-gx.pdf), 79% of global\nexecutives rated agile performance management as a high organizational\npriority.) But other HR processes are starting to change too.\n\nIn many companies that's happening gradually, almost organically, as a\nspillover from IT, where more than 90% of organizations already use agile\npractices. At the Bank of Montreal (BMO), for example, the shift began as tech\nemployees joined cross-functional product-development teams to make the bank\nmore customer focused. The business side has learned agile principles from IT\ncolleagues, and IT has learned about customer needs from the business. One\nresult is that BMO now thinks about performance management in terms of teams,\nnot just individuals. Elsewhere the move to agile HR has been faster and more\ndeliberate. GE is a prime example. Seen for many years as a paragon of\nmanagement through control systems, it switched to FastWorks, a lean approach\nthat cuts back on top-down financial controls and empowers teams to manage\nprojects as needs evolve.\n\nThe changes in HR have been a long time coming. After World War II, when\nmanufacturing dominated the industrial landscape, planning was at the heart of\nhuman resources: Companies recruited lifers, gave them rotational assignments\nto support their development, groomed them years in advance to take on bigger\nand bigger roles, and tied their raises directly to each incremental move up\nthe ladder. The bureaucracy was the point: Organizations wanted their talent\npractices to be rules-based and internally consistent so that they could\nreliably meet five-year (and sometimes 15-year) plans. That made sense. Every\nother aspect of companies, from core businesses to administrative functions,\ntook the long view in their goal setting, budgeting, and operations. HR\nreflected and supported what they were doing.\n\nBy the 1990s, as business became less predictable and companies needed to\nacquire new skills fast, that traditional approach began to bend--but it\ndidn't quite break. Lateral hiring from the outside--to get more flexibility--\nreplaced a good deal of the internal development and promotions. \"Broadband\"\ncompensation gave managers greater latitude to reward people for growth and\nachievement within roles. For the most part, though, the old model persisted.\nLike other functions, HR was still built around the long term. Workforce and\nsuccession planning carried on, even though changes in the economy and in the\nbusiness often rendered those plans irrelevant. Annual appraisals continued,\ndespite almost universal dissatisfaction with them.\n\nNow we're seeing a more sweeping transformation. Why is this the moment for\nit? Because rapid innovation has become a strategic imperative for most\ncompanies, not just a subset. To get it, businesses have looked to Silicon\nValley and to software companies in particular, emulating their agile\npractices for managing projects. So top-down planning models are giving way to\nnimbler, user-driven methods that are better suited for adapting in the near\nterm, such as rapid prototyping, iterative feedback, team-based decisions, and\ntask-centered \"sprints.\" As BMO's chief transformation officer, Lynn Roger,\nputs it, \"Speed is the new business currency.\"\n\nWith the business justification for the old HR systems gone and the agile\nplaybook available to copy, people management is finally getting its long-\nawaited overhaul too. In this article we'll illustrate some of the profound\nchanges companies are making in their talent practices and describe the\nchallenges they face in their transition to agile HR.\n\n## Where We're Seeing the Biggest Changes\n\nBecause HR touches every aspect--and every employee--of an organization, its\nagile transformation may be even more extensive (and more difficult) than the\nchanges in other functions. Companies are redesigning their talent practices\nin the following areas:\n\n### Performance appraisals.\n\nWhen businesses adopted agile methods in their core operations, they dropped\nthe charade of trying to plan a year or more in advance how projects would go\nand when they would end. So in many cases the first traditional HR practice to\ngo was the annual performance review, along with employee goals that\n\"cascaded\" down from business and unit objectives each year. As individuals\nworked on shorter-term projects of various lengths, often run by different\nleaders and organized around teams, the notion that performance feedback would\ncome once a year, from one boss, made little sense. They needed more of it,\nmore often, from more people.\n\n[An early-days CEB\nsurvey](https://www.cebglobal.com/content/dam/cebglobal/us/EN/best-practices-\ndecision-support/human-resources/pdfs/eliminate-performance-ratings.pdf)\nsuggested that people actually got _less_ feedback and support when their\nemployers dropped annual reviews. However, that's because many companies put\nnothing in their place. Managers felt no pressing need to adopt a new feedback\nmodel and shifted their attention to other priorities. But dropping appraisals\nwithout a plan to fill the void was of course a recipe for failure.\n\nSince learning that hard lesson, many organizations have switched to frequent\nperformance assessments, often conducted project by project. This change has\nspread to a number of industries, including retail (Gap), big pharma (Pfizer),\ninsurance (Cigna), investing (OppenheimerFunds), consumer products (P&G), and\naccounting (all Big Four firms). It is most famous at GE, across the firm's\nrange of businesses, and at IBM. Overall, the focus is on delivering more-\nimmediate feedback throughout the year so that teams can become nimbler,\n\"course-correct\" mistakes, improve performance, and learn through iteration--\nall key agile principles.\n\nIn user-centered fashion, managers and employees have had a hand in shaping,\ntesting, and refining new processes. For instance, Johnson & Johnson offered\nits businesses the chance to participate in an experiment: They could try out\na new continual-feedback process, using a customized app with which employees,\npeers, and bosses could exchange comments in real time.\n\nThe new process was an attempt to move away from J&J's event-driven \"five\nconversations\" framework (which focused on goal setting, career discussion, a\nmidyear performance review, a year-end appraisal, and a compensation review)\nand toward a model of ongoing dialogue. Those who tried it were asked to share\nhow well everything worked, what the bugs were, and so on. The experiment\nlasted three months. At first only 20% of the managers in the pilot actively\nparticipated. The inertia from prior years of annual appraisals was hard to\novercome. But then the company used training to show managers what good\nfeedback could look like and designated \"change champions\" to model the\ndesired behaviors on their teams. By the end of the three months, 46% of\nmanagers in the pilot group had joined in, exchanging 3,000 pieces of\nfeedback.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, a fast-growing biotech company, is going even\nfurther with its appraisals overhaul. Michelle Weitzman-Garcia, Regeneron's\nhead of workforce development, argued that the performance of the scientists\nworking on drug development, the product supply group, the field sales force,\nand the corporate functions should not be measured on the same cycle or in the\nsame way. She observed that these employee groups needed varying feedback and\nthat they even operated on different calendars.\n\n#### Why Intuit's Transition to Agile Almost Stalled Out\n\nThe financial services division at Intuit began shifting to agile in 2009--but\nfour years went by before that became standard operating procedure across the\ncompany.\n\nWhat took so long? Leaders started with a \"waterfall\" approach to change\nmanagement, because that's what they knew best. It didn't work. Spotty support\nfrom middle management, part-time commitments to the team leading the\ntransformation, scarce administrative resources, and an extended planning\ncycle all put a big drag on the rollout.\n\nBefore agile could gain traction throughout the organization, the transition\nteam needed to take an agile approach to _becoming_ agile and managing the\nchange. Looking back, Joumana Youssef, one of Intuit's strategic-change\nleaders, identifies several critical discoveries that changed the course--and\nthe speed--of the transformation:\n\n  * Focus on early adopters. Don't waste time trying to convert naysayers.\n  * Form \"triple-S\" (small, stable, self-managed) teams, give them ownership of their work, and hold them accountable for their commitments.\n  * Quickly train leaders at all levels in agile methods. Agile teams need to be fully supported to self-manage.\n  * Expect that changing frontline and middle management will be hard, because people in those roles need time to acclimate to \"servant leadership,\" which is primarily about coaching and supporting employees rather than monitoring them.\n  * Stay the course. Even though agile change is faster than a waterfall approach, shifting your organization's mindset takes persistence.\n\nSo the company created four distinct appraisal processes, tailored to the\nvarious groups' needs. The research scientists and postdocs, for example,\ncrave metrics and are keen on assessing competencies, so they meet with\nmanagers twice a year for competency evaluations and milestones reviews.\nCustomer-facing groups include feedback from clients and customers in their\nassessments. Although having to manage four separate processes adds\ncomplexity, they all reinforce the new norm of continual feedback. And\nWeitzman-Garcia says the benefits to the organization far outweigh the costs\nto HR.\n\n### Coaching.\n\nThe companies that most effectively adopt agile talent practices invest in\nsharpening managers' coaching skills. Supervisors at Cigna go through \"coach\"\ntraining designed for busy managers: It's broken into weekly 90-minute videos\nthat can be viewed as people have time. The supervisors also engage in\nlearning sessions, which, like \"learning sprints\" in agile project management,\nare brief and spread out to allow individuals to reflect and test-drive new\nskills on the job. Peer-to-peer feedback is incorporated in Cigna's manager\ntraining too: Colleagues form learning cohorts to share ideas and tactics.\nThey're having the kinds of conversations companies want supervisors to have\nwith their direct reports, but they feel freer to share mistakes with one\nanother, without the fear of \"evaluation\" hanging over their heads.\n\nDigitalOcean, a New York-based start-up focused on software as a service\n(SaaS) infrastructure, engages a full-time professional coach on-site to help\nall managers give better feedback to employees and, more broadly, to develop\ninternal coaching capabilities. The idea is that once one experiences good\ncoaching, one becomes a better coach. Not everyone is expected to become a\ngreat coach--those in the company who prefer coding to coaching can advance\nalong a technical career track--but coaching skills are considered central to\na managerial career.\n\nP&G, too, is intent on making managers better coaches. That's part of a larger\neffort to rebuild training and development for supervisors and enhance their\nrole in the organization. By simplifying the performance review process,\nseparating evaluation from development discussions, and eliminating talent\ncalibration sessions (the arbitrary horse trading between supervisors that\noften comes with a subjective and politicized ranking model), P&G has freed up\na lot of time to devote to employees' growth. But getting supervisors to move\nfrom judging employees to coaching them in their day-to-day work has been a\nchallenge in P&G's tradition-rich culture. So the company has invested heavily\nin training supervisors on topics such as how to establish employees'\npriorities and goals, how to provide feedback about contributions, and how to\nalign employees' career aspirations with business needs and learning and\ndevelopment plans. The bet is that building employees' capabilities and\nrelationships with supervisors will increase engagement and therefore help the\ncompany innovate and move faster. Even though the jury is still out on the\ncompanywide culture shift, P&G is already reporting improvements in these\nareas, at all levels of management.\n\n### Teams.\n\nTraditional HR focused on individuals--their goals, their performance, their\nneeds. But now that so many companies are organizing their work project by\nproject, their management and talent systems are becoming more team focused.\nGroups are creating, executing, and revising their goals and tasks with scrums\n--at the team level, in the moment, to adapt quickly to new information as it\ncomes in. (\"Scrum\" may be the best-known term in the agile lexicon. It comes\nfrom rugby, where players pack tightly together to restart play.) They are\nalso taking it upon themselves to track their own progress, identify\nobstacles, assess their leadership, and generate insights about how to improve\nperformance.\n\nIn that context, organizations must learn to contend with:\n\n_Multidirectional feedback._ Peer feedback is essential to course corrections\nand employee development in an agile environment, because team members know\nbetter than anyone else what each person is contributing. It's rarely a formal\nprocess, and comments are generally directed to the employee, not the\nsupervisor. That keeps input constructive and prevents the [undermining of\ncolleagues](http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employees-reportedly-slam-\neach-other-through-this-internal-review-tool-2015-8) that sometimes occurs in\nhypercompetitive workplaces.\n\nBut some executives believe that peer feedback should have an impact on\nperformance evaluations. Diane Gherson, IBM's head of HR, explains that \"the\nrelationships between managers and employees change in the context of a\nnetwork [the collection of projects across which employees work].\" Because an\nagile environment makes it practically impossible to \"monitor\" performance in\nthe old sense, managers at IBM solicit input from others to help them identify\nand address issues early on. Unless it's sensitive, that input is shared in\nthe team's daily stand-up meetings and captured in an app. Employees may\nchoose whether to include managers and others in their comments to peers. The\nrisk of cutthroat behavior is mitigated by the fact that peer comments to the\nsupervisor also go to the team. Anyone trying to undercut colleagues will be\nexposed.\n\nIn agile organizations, \"upward\" feedback from employees to team leaders and\nsupervisors is highly valued too. The Mitre Corporation's not-for-profit\nresearch centers have taken steps to encourage it, but they're finding that\nthis requires concentrated effort. They started with periodic confidential\nemployee surveys and focus groups to discover which issues people wanted to\ndiscuss with their managers. HR then distilled that data for supervisors to\ninform their conversations with direct reports. However, employees were\ninitially hesitant to provide upward feedback--even though it was anonymous\nand was used for development purposes only--because they weren't accustomed to\nvoicing their thoughts about what management was doing.\n\nMitre also learned that the most critical factor in getting subordinates to be\ncandid was having managers explicitly say that they wanted and appreciated\ncomments. Otherwise people might worry, reasonably, that their leaders weren't\nreally open to feedback and ready to apply it. As with any employee survey,\nsoliciting upward feedback and not acting on it has a diminishing effect on\nparticipation; it erodes the hard-earned trust between employees and their\nmanagers. When Mitre's new performance-management and feedback process began,\nthe CEO acknowledged that the research centers would need to iterate and make\nimprovements. A revised system for upward feedback will roll out this year.\n\nBecause feedback flows in all directions on teams, many companies use\ntechnology to manage the sheer volume of it. Apps allow supervisors,\ncoworkers, and clients to give one another immediate feedback from wherever\nthey are. Crucially, supervisors can download all the comments later on, when\nit's time to do evaluations. In some apps, employees and supervisors can score\nprogress on goals; at least one helps managers analyze conversations on\nproject management platforms like Slack to provide feedback on collaboration.\nCisco uses proprietary technology to collect weekly raw data, or\n\"breadcrumbs,\" from employees about their peers' performance. Such tools\nenable managers to see fluctuations in individual performance over time, even\nwithin teams. The apps don't provide an official record of performance, of\ncourse, and employees may want to discuss problems face-to-face to avoid\nhaving them recorded in a file that can be downloaded. We know that [companies\nrecognize and reward\nimprovement](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265063411_What_Do_Performance_Appraisals_Do)\nas well as actual performance, however, so hiding problems may not always pay\noff for employees.\n\n_Frontline decision rights._ The fundamental shift toward teams has also\naffected decision rights: Organizations are pushing them down to the front\nlines, equipping and empowering employees to operate more independently. But\nthat's a huge behavioral change, and people need support to pull it off. Let's\nreturn to the Bank of Montreal example to illustrate how it can work. When BMO\nintroduced agile teams to design some new customer services, senior leaders\nweren't quite ready to give up control, and the people under them were not\nused to taking it. So the bank embedded agile coaches in business teams. They\nbegan by putting everyone, including high-level executives, through\n\"retrospectives\"--regular reflection and feedback sessions held after each\niteration. These are the agile version of after-action reviews; their purpose\nis to keep improving processes. Because the retrospectives quickly identified\nconcrete successes, failures, and root causes, senior leaders at BMO\nimmediately recognized their value, which helped them get on board with agile\ngenerally and loosen their grip on decision making.\n\n_Complex team dynamics._ Finally, since the supervisor's role has moved away\nfrom just managing individuals and toward the much more complicated task of\npromoting productive, healthy team dynamics, people often need help with that,\ntoo. Cisco's special Team Intelligence unit provides that kind of support.\nIt's charged with identifying the company's best-performing teams, analyzing\nhow they operate, and helping other teams learn how to become more like them.\nIt uses an enterprise-wide platform called Team Space, which tracks data on\nteam projects, needs, and achievements to both measure and improve what teams\nare doing within units and across the company.\n\n### Compensation.\n\nPay is changing as well. A simple adaptation to agile work, seen in retail\ncompanies such as Macy's, is to use spot bonuses to recognize contributions\nwhen they happen rather than rely solely on end-of-year salary increases.\n[Research and practice](https://ceo.usc.edu/files/2016/09/CE_PM_FINAL.pdf)\nhave shown that compensation works best as a motivator when it comes as soon\nas possible after the desired behavior. Instant rewards reinforce instant\nfeedback in a powerful way. Annual merit-based raises are less effective,\nbecause too much time goes by.\n\nPatagonia has actually eliminated annual raises for its knowledge workers.\nInstead the company adjusts wages for each job much more frequently, according\nto research on where market rates are going. Increases can also be allocated\nwhen employees take on more-difficult projects or go above and beyond in other\nways. The company retains a budget for the top 1% of individual contributors,\nand supervisors can make a case for any contribution that merits that\ndesignation, including contributions to teams.\n\nUpward feedback from employees to team leaders is valued in agile\norganizations.\n\nCompensation is also being used to reinforce agile values such as learning and\nknowledge sharing. In the start-up world, for instance, the online clothing-\nrental company Rent the Runway dropped separate bonuses, rolling the money\ninto base pay. CEO Jennifer Hyman reports that the bonus program was getting\nin the way of honest peer feedback. Employees weren't sharing constructive\ncriticism, knowing it could have negative financial consequences for their\ncolleagues. The new system prevents that problem by \"untangling the two, \"\nHyman says.\n\nDigitalOcean redesigned its rewards to promote equitable treatment of\nemployees and a culture of collaboration. Salary adjustments now happen twice\na year to respond to changes in the outside labor market and in jobs and\nperformance. More important, DigitalOcean has closed gaps in pay for\nequivalent work. It's deliberately heading off internal rivalry, painfully\naware of the problems in hypercompetitive cultures (think Microsoft and\nAmazon). To personalize compensation, the firm maps where people are having\nimpact in their roles and where they need to grow and develop. The data on\nindividuals' impact on the business is a key factor in discussions about pay.\nNegotiating to raise your own salary is fiercely discouraged. And only the top\n1% of achievement is rewarded financially; otherwise, there is no merit-pay\nprocess. All employees are eligible for bonuses, which are based on company\nperformance rather than individual contributions. To further support\ncollaboration, DigitalOcean is diversifying its portfolio of rewards to\ninclude nonfinancial, meaningful gifts, such as a Kindle loaded with the CEO's\n\"best books\" picks.\n\nHow does DigitalOcean motivate people to perform their best without inflated\nfinancial rewards? Matt Hoffman, its vice president of people, says it focuses\non creating a culture that inspires purpose and creativity. So far that seems\nto be working. The latest engagement survey, via Culture Amp, ranks\nDigitalOcean 17 points above the industry benchmark in satisfaction with\ncompensation.\n\n### Recruiting.\n\nWith the improvements in the economy since the Great Recession, recruiting and\nhiring have become more urgent--and more agile. To scale up quickly in 2015,\nGE's new digital division pioneered some interesting recruiting experiments.\nFor instance, a cross-functional team works together on all hiring\nrequisitions. A \"head count manager\" represents the interests of internal\nstakeholders who want their positions filled quickly and appropriately. Hiring\nmanagers rotate on and off the team, depending on whether they're currently\nhiring, and a scrum master oversees the process.\n\nTo keep things moving, the team focuses on vacancies that have cleared all the\nhurdles--no req's get started if debate is still ongoing about the desired\nattributes of candidates. Openings are ranked, and the team concentrates on\nthe top-priority hires until they are completed. It works on several hires at\nonce so that members can share information about candidates who may fit better\nin other roles. The team keeps track of its cycle time for filling positions\nand monitors all open requisitions on a kanban board to identify bottlenecks\nand blocked processes. IBM now takes a similar approach to recruitment.\n\nCompanies are also relying more heavily on technology to find and track\ncandidates who are well suited to an agile work environment. GE, IBM, and\nCisco are working with the vendor Ascendify to create software that does just\nthis. The IT recruiting company HackerRank offers an online tool for the same\npurpose.\n\n### Learning and development.\n\nLike hiring, L&D had to change to bring new skills into organizations more\nquickly. Most companies already have a suite of online learning modules that\nemployees can access on demand. Although helpful for those who have clearly\ndefined needs, this is a bit like giving a student the key to a library and\ntelling her to figure out what she must know and then learn it. Newer\napproaches use data analysis to identify the skills required for particular\njobs and for advancement and then suggest to individual employees what kinds\nof training and future jobs make sense for them, given their experience and\ninterests.\n\nIBM uses artificial intelligence to generate such advice, starting with\nemployees' profiles, which include prior and current roles, expected career\ntrajectory, and training programs completed. The company has also created\nspecial training for agile environments--using, for example, animated\nsimulations built around a series of \"personas\" to illustrate useful\nbehaviors, such as offering constructive criticism.\n\n#### What HR Can Learn from Tech\n\nThe agile pioneers in the tech world are years ahead of everyone else in\nadopting the methodology at scale. So who better to provide guidance as\nmanagers and HR leaders grapple with how to apply agile talent practices\nthroughout their organizations? In a recent survey, thousands of software\ndevelopers across many countries and industries identified their biggest\nobstacles in scaling and the ways they got past them.\n\n![R1802B_SPOT_WHATHRCANLEARN](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_WHATHRCANLEARN.png)\n\nFind this and other HBR graphics in our [Visual Library __](/visual-\nlibrary/2018/03/what-hr-can-learn-from-tech)\n\nTraditionally, L&D has included succession planning--the epitome of top-down,\nlong-range thinking, whereby individuals are picked years in advance to take\non the most crucial leadership roles, usually in the hope that they will\ndevelop certain capabilities on schedule. The world often fails to cooperate\nwith those plans, though. Companies routinely find that by the time senior\nleadership positions open up, their needs have changed. The most common\nsolution is to ignore the plan and start a search from scratch. But\norganizations often continue doing long-term succession planning anyway.\n([About half](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-\nresearch/publications/2010-ceo-succession-planning-survey) of large companies\nhave a plan to develop successors for the top job.) Pepsi is one company\ntaking a simple step away from this model by shortening the time frame. It\nprovides brief quarterly updates on the development of possible successors--in\ncontrast to the usual annual updates--and delays appointments so that they\nhappen closer to when successors are likely to step into their roles.\n\n## Ongoing Challenges\n\nTo be sure, not every organization or group is in hot pursuit of rapid\ninnovation. Some jobs must remain largely rules based. (Consider the work that\naccountants, nuclear control-room operators, and surgeons do.) In such cases\nagile talent practices may not make sense.\n\nAnd even when they're appropriate, they may meet resistance--especially within\nHR. A lot of processes have to change for an organization to move away from a\nplanning-based, \"waterfall\" model (which is linear rather than flexible and\nadaptive), and some of them are hardwired into information systems, job\ntitles, and so forth. The move toward cloud-based IT, which is happening\nindependently, has made it easier to adopt app-based tools. But people issues\nremain a sticking point. Many HR tasks, such as traditional approaches to\nrecruitment, onboarding, and program coordination, will become obsolete, as\nwill expertise in those areas.\n\nMeanwhile, new tasks are being created. Helping supervisors replace judging\nwith coaching is a big challenge not just in terms of skills but also because\nit undercuts their status and formal authority. Shifting the focus of\nmanagement from individuals to teams may be even more difficult, because team\ndynamics can be a black box to those who are still struggling to understand\nhow to coach individuals. The big question is whether companies can help\nmanagers take all this on and see the value in it.\n\nThe HR function will also require reskilling. It will need more expertise in\nIT support--especially given all the performance data generated by the new\napps--and deeper knowledge about teams and hands-on supervision. HR has not\nhad to change in recent decades nearly as much as have the line operations it\nsupports. But now the pressure is on, and it's coming from the operating\nlevel, which makes it much harder to cling to old talent practices.\n\n* * *\n\n[Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter+cappelli) is the George W.

Diane Gherson, the chief human resources officer at IBM, recently\nspoke with HBR about how that's playing out as the iconic tech company revamps\nits business model. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nHBR: In what sense is IBM putting employee experience at the center of people\nmanagement?\n\nGHERSON: Like a lot of other companies, we started with the belief that if\npeople felt great about working with us, our clients would too. That wasn't a\nnew thought, but it's certainly one we took very seriously, going back about\nfour or five years. We've since seen it borne out. We've found that employee\nengagement explains two-thirds of our client experience scores. And if we're\nable to increase client satisfaction by five points on an account, we see an\nextra 20% in revenue, on average. So clearly there's an impact. That's the\nbusiness case for the change.\n\nBut it has required a shift in mindset. Before, we tended to rely on experts\nto build our HR programs. Now we bring employees into the design process, co-\ncreate with them, and iterate over time so that we meet people's needs.\n\n![R1802B_SPOT_MONTANA.jpg](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_MONTANA.jpg)\n\nSally Montana\n\nDiane Gherson, IBM's head of HR\n\nWhat does that look like in practice?\n\nA good example is employee onboarding--the first process we took a very hard\nlook at. We knew we wanted people to walk out thinking, \"I'm superexcited I'm\nhere, and I understand what I need to know to get going.\" But we started too\nsmall. We approached it in a traditional way that made it all about the\norientation class, all about the experience you have on your first day. Once\nwe began asking new hires how their onboarding had gone, we heard things like\n\"I didn't get my laptop on time,\" or \"I couldn't get my credit card in time to\nget to my first meeting,\" or \"I had problems accessing the internal network.\"\nAll those things affect how someone feels about having joined the company.\n\nOnce you realize that, the remit for the onboarding team becomes how people\nexperience the whole process, end to end. To get it right, you have to work\nwith a broader set of players. You bring in Security to make sure the ID\nbadges are there. You bring in Real Estate to make sure people have a physical\nspace and know where to go. You bring in Networking to make sure their remote\naccess is up and running. All that is part of onboarding. It's not just having\na great meeting with a bunch of other new hires on your first day.\n\nIt took a while for us to understand that. You have to broaden your scope and\nstop thinking in silos in order to create a great employee experience.\n\nHow has IBM's approach to learning and development changed?\n\nPeople consume content on their phones and tablets now--they use YouTube and\nTED talks to get up to speed on things they don't know. So we had to put aside\nour traditional learning-management system and think differently about\neducation and development. Again, we brought in our Millennials, brought in\nour users, and codesigned a learning platform that is individually\npersonalized for every one of our 380,000 IBMers.\n\nIt's tailored by role, with intelligent recommendations that are continually\nupdated. And it's organized sort of like Netflix, with different channels. You\ncan see how others have rated the various offerings. There's also a live-chat\nadviser, who helps learners in the moment.\n\nWe measure HR offerings such as learning with a Net Promoter Score--the\nultimate metric for an irresistible experience. Before, we used a classic\nfive-point satisfaction scale. Even if someone rated you a 3.1, you ended up\nsaying they were satisfied, whereas with Net Promoter, you have to be at the\nfar end of the scale for it to mean anything, because you have to subtract all\nthe detractors. It's much harder to get that, and it gives you much better\nfeedback on what people are experiencing. For learning, at last count, our NPS\nwas 60. That's in the \"excellent\" range, but of course there's still room to\nimprove.\n\nWhat kinds of tools do you use to customize learning?\n\nWith Watson Analytics, we're able to infer people's expertise from their\ndigital footprint inside the company, and we compare that with where they\nshould be in their particular job family. The system is cognitive, so it knows\nyou--it has ingested the data about your skills and is able to give you\npersonalized learning recommendations. It tells you, \"OK, you need to increase\nyour depth in these areas--and here are the offerings that will help you do\nthat.\" You can then pin those or queue them up in your calendar for future\nlearning. The system also looks at how close you may be to earning a digital\nbadge, which we've started using in just the past couple of years to\ndemonstrate which employees have applied skills. The tool then helps you\nachieve the badge by recommending specific webinars and internal and external\ncourses. It's all based on artificial intelligence. Skills inference is at\nabout 96% accuracy at this point.\n\n\"People are less likely to resist change when they've had a hand in shaping\nit.\"\n\nHow do you know that?\n\nWe used to have this laborious manual process of getting people to fill out\nskills questionnaires and having their managers sign off on them. But that\ngets outdated really fast. So we stopped doing that. Instead, leaders in\nparticular job families or industries do spot checks on how well we are\ninferring. They interview employees and identify where they are, comparing\nthat with what the inference was in our system.\n\nIBM has given its performance management system an overhaul as well. How have\nemployees been involved in that process?\n\nAs you know, performance management is kind of a lightning rod in most\ncompanies. Rather than do the typical thing--which would be to do some\nbenchmarking, pull together a bunch of experts, come up with a new design, and\npilot it--we decided to go all out and co-create it with our employees in a\nsort of extended hackathon. We used design thinking and came up with what you\nmight describe as a \"concept car\"--something for people to test drive and kick\nthe tires on, instead of just dealing with concepts. We did that in the summer\nof 2015 and implemented it across the company five months later. That's the\npower of engaging the whole workforce--people are much less likely to resist\nthe change when they've had a hand in shaping it.\n\nTo start the co-creation process, I blogged about it one day and said, \"We'd\nlove your input. If you hate it, we'll start over, no problem. But we really\nwant your thoughts.\" We made a few videos about what we thought it might look\nlike. I got 18,000 responses overnight. Fortunately, we had the technology to\nanalyze it all and see what people liked and didn't like.\n\nAt first some people said, \"This is such a sham--you already know what you\nwant to do.\" But we explained that we really wanted to hear from them, and we\ngot them into various discussion forums. It took a while, but I think we did\nturn them around. We kept communicating, saying, \"OK, you liked this; you\ndidn't like that. And here are areas where you can't seem to agree.\"\nMeanwhile, we were putting together prototypes to show people.\n\nI was clear up front that there were some ground rules. For example, we were\nnot going to get rid of performance discussions, and we wanted pay-for-\nperformance. But in general, it was wide open. The whole process took less\ntime than most companies take to redesign their performance management\nprograms, and we involved about 100,000 employees. Finally, we asked, \"What do\nyou want to call it?\" Tens of thousands of people voted. We had three names in\nthe end, and Checkpoint was selected.\n\nPerformance management can never be perfect. But your baby is never ugly. Our\nemployees created their own program, and there is pride in that. You can see\nit in their ongoing blogs, where we ask them to talk about what's working and\nwhat's not and to tell us how we can improve the system. We've been doing that\never since we put it out there. Their overall message has been \"This is what\nwe wanted.\" It was cited as the top reason engagement improved. People are\ngetting much more feedback out of this system, in much richer ways. And more\nimportant, they are not feeling like spectators in our transformation; they\nare active participants.\n\n\"We've been able to swiftly detect problems and commit to doing something\nabout them.\"\n\nHow are you using \"sentiment analysis\" to further address employees' needs?\n\nSentiment analysis is very helpful in a world where people are always\ncommenting online. Our cognitive technology looks at the words people choose\nand picks up the tone. It identifies whether it's positive or negative and\nthen goes deeper, saying whether it's strongly positive or strongly negative.\nIn that way it's almost like looking at music--seeing where there are very\nhigh notes or very low notes that are loud. It's always behind our firewall,\nnever external. It's not looking at any of the information people pass around\nor at their e-mail content or browsing behavior. It's just looking at tone in\ntheir blogs and comments inside the firewall.\n\nWith this approach you can pick up pretty quickly if there's an area you need\nto dive into. We've been able to swiftly detect problems that are starting to\nbrew and, more important, make a commitment to do something about them. This\nis the most exciting part of having a social platform to work with. We've had\nseveral examples of things we did wrong. Some of my folks decided we wouldn't\nreimburse for ridesharing. Employees became agitated, and I could quickly\nrespond to a concern that had turned into a petition. \"I read all your\ncomments,\" I told them, \"and you made some great points we hadn't thought of.\nWe were trying to look out for your security, but on balance, this wasn't the\nright choice. Let's return to our original policy.\" All this happened within\n24 hours. People felt listened to and were very appreciative.\n\nWe had a similar situation about a year ago. We had to impute income when you\nwere traveling to a client site for a full week and, instead of returning home\nright away, you had your spouse or a friend join you for the weekend. Because\nwe would reimburse the guest's travel, it created a tax issue. We altered the\nprogram because that was getting messy, and again employees were incensed. I\ncan certainly understand why. If you're on the road all the time, of course\nyou might want your spouse to join you for a weekend. People didn't want us\nmaking the decision for them. That was another case where we quickly got\ntogether and said, \"Hey, if they want to be responsible for their own taxes,\nthey can do it.\" It was a good wake-up call for us to not be so paternalistic.\n\nIn organizations where people aren't physically all together, you can use\nsentiment analysis to get a sense of where you've got trouble spots, where\nyour management isn't strong enough, where groups of people are expressing\nnegative opinions. It allows you to check in on those sites or groups and find\nout what's going on.\n\nDo employees have more power now than in the past?\n\nYes. So much more weight is now given to what is said inside an organization,\nbecause it can be heard outside as well, through social media. Glassdoor is a\nperfect example. In the past you might have had companies that weren't great\nto work for, but only a small circle of people knew about it. Now the whole\nworld knows about it, because it's on Glassdoor--and that's turned companies\ninto glass houses. People can look in and see what's going on and make\njudgments about whether they want to work there in a way that they weren't\nable to before.\n\nLet's go back to the business reasons behind IBM's shift to agile talent\npractices--can you say more about those?\n\nI mentioned client satisfaction. Clients today are looking for speed and\nresponsiveness like never before. In an earlier era what they really wanted\nwas the best product at the best price--efficiency was important, but speed\nwas less so.\n\nIn the early 2000s we would have staffed a project with experts from all over\nthe world, and they would have spent a fraction of their time on that project,\nbecause they were also working on other projects. They would have joined\nconference calls, which is always hard because people are in different time\nzones. And I'm sure they were multitasking while they were on those calls.\nThat project might have taken six months to a year. Now we would take a\nsmaller group of dedicated people and put them together for three months, and\nthey would get it all done using agile methodology. It's a different way of\nthinking about how to create value for clients. It responds to their need for\nspeed.\n\nIs there some hope that an agile approach to talent will help IBM make up\nground in revenue and growth that it lost in its transition to cloud computing\nand other businesses?\n\nWe're a company that's transforming itself: 45% of our revenue comes from\nbusinesses we were not in five years ago, and we are an $80 billion company.\nWhen you're going through that kind of shift and seeing a downturn in some of\nyour legacy businesses, and you're renovating those while you're launching new\nbusinesses, you may see some unevenness in performance. You're basically\nchanging the tires while you're driving the car. And yes, that takes agility.\n\n* * *\n\n[Lisa Burrell](/search?term=lisa+burrell) is a senior editor at _Harvard\nBusiness Review_.\n\n* * *\n\n## One Bank\u2019s Agile Team Experiment\n\n  * [Dominic Barton](/search?term=dominic%20barton)\n  * [Dennis Carey](/search?term=dennis%20carey)\n  * [Ram Charan](/search?term=ram%20charan)\n\n  * __Save\n  * __Share\n\n![COLORMOS/GETTY\nIMAGES](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_BARTON.jpg)\n\nCOLORMOS/GETTY IMAGES\n\nWhen web and mobile technologies disrupted the banking industry, consumers\nbecame more and more aware of what they could do for themselves. They quickly\nembraced what Ralph Hamers, CEO of the global banking group ING, calls\n\"banking on the go.\"\n\nBy 2014 about 40% of all interactions with ING retail customers were coming in\nthrough mobile apps. (Now the figure is closer to 60%--and branch visits and\ncalls to contact centers have dropped below 1%.) Even then mobile customers\nexpected easy access to up-to-date information whenever and wherever they\nlogged in. For instance, someone who started a loan transaction during the\ntrain ride home from work wanted to be able to continue it on a desktop that\nnight. \"Our customers were spending most of their online time on platforms\nlike Facebook and Netflix,\" says Hamers. \"Those set the standard for user\nexperience.\"\n\nThat meant ING needed to become nimbler and more user-focused to serve its 30\nmillion-plus customers across the world at every point in their financial\njourneys. So Hamers worked with Nick Jue, then the CEO of ING's Netherlands\ngroup, to launch a pilot transformation in the headquarters of ING's largest\nunit, its Dutch retail operations. The first step was to help other senior\nleaders and the board envision a new agile, team-based system for deploying,\ndeveloping, and assessing talent. (ING had already adopted agile and scrum\nmethodologies in its Dutch IT unit, but those ways of working were new to\nother parts of the organization.) Hamers and his leadership team then met with\npeople at tech companies they admired, learning how their talent systems\nenabled better customer service. By the spring of 2015 the headquarters of ING\nNetherlands, home to some 3,500 full-time employees, had replaced most of its\ntraditional structure with a fluid, agile organization composed of _tribes,\nsquads,_ and _chapters._\n\n#### Tribes, Squads, and Chapters\n\nING's new agile system for deploying talent and managing performance organizes\npeople by domain, customer need, and function. After experimenting with this\nstructure in its Dutch retail unit, the company decided to roll it out more\nbroadly.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_TRIBES.png)\n\nThirteen tribes were created to address specific domains, such as mortgage\nservices, securities, and private banking. Each tribe contains up to 150\npeople. (Employees in sales, service, and support functions work outside this\nstructure--in smaller customer-loyalty teams, for instance--but they\ncollaborate with the tribes.) And each has a lead who establishes priorities,\nallocates budgets, and ensures that knowledge and insights are shared both\nwithin and across tribes.\n\nThe tribe lead has one other critical responsibility: to create, with input\nfrom tribe members, self-steering squads of nine or fewer people to address\nspecific customer needs by delivering and maintaining new products and\nservices. These squads are cross-disciplinary--typically, a mix of marketing\nspecialists, data analysts, user-experience designers, IT engineers, and\nproduct specialists. One squad member is designated the \"product owner,\"\nresponsible for coordinating activities and setting priorities. The squad\nstays together as long as is required to meet the customer need from start to\nfinish--whether it is, for example, improving user experience on the mobile\napp or building a particular feature. Some tasks are completed in two weeks;\nothers might take 18 months. Sometimes the squads disband and the members join\nother ones. Most often, however, squads that are working well stay together\nand move on to address other customer needs.\n\nBy working in such small units and with colleagues from various disciplines,\nsquad members can quickly resolve issues that might previously have bounced\nfrom department to department. Information sharing is encouraged through\nmechanisms such as scrums and daily stand-ups--the kinds of gatherings you'd\nfind at a tech start-up. Seeing a project through from start to finish gives\neach squad a sense of ownership and connection to the customer.\n\nImplementing an agile talent system doesn't mean embracing chaos. In fact, a\nsystem that's well designed observes clearly defined rules and safeguards to\nensure institutional stability. Every tribe, for example, has a couple of\nagile coaches to help squads and individuals collaborate effectively in an\nenvironment where employees are encouraged to solve problems on the ground\nrather than pass them on to someone else. Although you might think adapting\nwould be most difficult for long-term bank employees, that's not so, according\nto ING Netherlands CIO Peter Jacobs. Many of them \"adapted even more quickly\nand more readily than the younger generation,\" he says, perhaps because their\nexpertise now has more impact than in the past, when so many sign-offs were\nrequired.\n\nWorking in small, cross-functional units, squads can resolve issues quickly.\n\nThen there are the chapters, which coordinate members of the same discipline--\ndata analytics, say, or systems processes--who are scattered among squads.\nChapter leads are responsible for tracking and sharing best practices and for\nsuch things as professional development and performance reviews. Think of\nchapters as a way of retaining the helpful parts of traditional management\neven while dispensing with time-consuming handoffs and bureaucracy.\n\nRegular assessments are built into the system. Every two weeks squads review\ntheir work. Says Hamers, \"They get to decide how they will continue to improve\nthe product for our customers, or if they want to 'fail fast.'\" (Learning from\nfailure is applauded.) Squads also do a thorough self-assessment after\ncompleting any engagement, and tribes perform quarterly business reviews\n(QBRs), looking at their biggest successes and failures, reviewing their most\nimportant learnings, and articulating goals for the next three months.\n\nThese safeguards help counter what Vincent van den Boogert, the current CEO of\nING Netherlands (and part of the team that launched the new organizational\nstructure), sees as the two biggest challenges of a squad-based system. One is\nthe possibility that self-empowered squads responding primarily to the needs\nof customers might embark on changes that aren't in sync with company\nstrategy. The QBRs mitigate that risk. The second challenge is somewhat\ncounterintuitive. Self-evaluating squads are sometimes content with the\nincremental improvements they make every two weeks. The QBRs help in that\nregard, too, because top management uses them to formulate and reinforce\nstretch goals.\n\nMore than two years in, Hamers considers the talent experiment a big success.\nCustomer satisfaction and employee engagement are both up, and ING is quicker\nto market with new products. So the bank has started to roll out this new way\nof working to the roughly 40,000 employees outside its home country. For\nHamers, the change can't come soon enough. The apps for each of ING's 13\nretail markets vary in appearance, design, and function. Hamers wants to make\nthings much simpler so that any customer, anywhere, will encounter the same\nING. \"Tech companies have one platform across the globe,\" he says. \"No matter\nwhere you use Netflix, Facebook, or Google, you get the same service. ING must\ndo the same. That is the only way we will bring all our customers along into\nthe future of banking.\"\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/110-dominic-barton.jpg)\n\n[Dominic Barton](/search?term=dominic+barton) is the global managing partner\nof McKinsey & Company.

She got the opportunity to help out with\npayroll and administration for a business in the NASCAR industry while the\nregular employees were on vacation.\n\n[\n![](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/c_crop%2ch_3700%2cw_3702%2cx_413%2cy_0/c_fit%2cf_auto%2cq_auto%2cw_767/v1/Magazine/iStock-479367704_n5nbzf)](/hr-\ntoday/news/hr-magazine/0517/Pages/5-Reasons-to-Seek-SHRM-certification-\nvideo.aspx)  \n  \n**Video : ** [5 Reasons to Seek SHRM Certification](/hr-today/news/hr-\nmagazine/0517/Pages/5-Reasons-to-Seek-SHRM-certification-video.aspx)\n\nEventually, she began working full time for the U.S. office of a Formula One\ncar racing series powerhouse. \u201cThey wanted someone who understood the\noperations of racing as well as an office, and they didn\u2019t have anyone in HR,\u201d\nshe recalls.\n\nHunter (pictured above) worked with the company\u2019s payroll vendor, set up its\n401(k) plan and other benefits, and learned many aspects of HR on the job, an\nexperience shared by many who find themselves working in HR.\n\n\u201cI convinced my company to pay for me to join a local [Society for Human\nResource Management (SHRM)] chapter,\u201d she says. \u201cI learned so much from other\nprofessionals and discovered that I knew more about HR than I thought.\u201d\n\nAs she prepared for the next steps in her career, she wanted a way to showcase\nthat she had critical HR skills. So she decided to pursue a [SHRM\ncertification](/certification/pages/default.aspx) and successfully sat for the\nexam during the first testing window in 2015. Within months of receiving her\ncredential in September of that year, she was getting wooed by companies\nlooking to hire a SHRM-certified professional.\n\nHunter interviewed for the operations director position at\n[Recruiter.com](https://www.recruiter.com/)\u2014a leading online careers site and\nrecruiting platform based in Farmington, Conn.\u2014where, she says, her SHRM-SCP\ncertification stood out. \u201cWith the certification, there was no question that I\ncould lead a team and handle payroll and other aspects of HR,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen the folks at Recruiter.com offered her the job, Hunter recalls one of\nthem saying, \u201cYou\u2019re SHRM. You\u2019ve got it.\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is \u201cit\u201d? Perhaps it\u2019s the understanding that today\u2019s HR\npractitioners must be adept at many roles in their day-to-day work\u2014business\nadvisor, leader, communicator, recruiter, brand expert and more\u2014and thus need\nto take a behavioral approach to their own professional growth. Yet until\nrecently, the career development and certification options for those working\nin HR remained mostly based on knowledge alone. By contrast, the materials in\nthe [SHRM Learning System](/certification/learning/pages/default.aspx)\u2014which\nHunter used to prepare for the certification exam\u2014focus on situations that HR\nprofessionals tackle every day.\n\n\u201cThe questions in the book involved so much more than just memorizing the date\nan act went into effect and what it covers,\u201d she says. \u201cThere were real-life\nexamples, and the correct answers gave me more experience just by reading\nthrough them and thinking critically about them.\u201d\n\nHunter recalls a sample question about what to do during a layoff when some of\nthe workforce is covered by the [Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/adea.cfm). The correct answer\nexplained that there are added protections and notice requirements that apply\nwhen workers age 40 or older are laid off. For example, those individuals\nshould be given more time to review a severance agreement that includes a\nwaiver of discrimination claims.\n\n\u201cNow, if my company were to close its doors and we were to provide severance\npackages, I know how it should play out,\u201d Hunter says.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why some HR professionals, including Anthony Ray, SHRM-CP,\nexecutive director of human resources for Morton College in Cicero, Ill.,\nchoose to keep the SHRM Learning System handy as a reference in the office.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be able to refer ... to the material when issues come up,\u201d he\nsays. \u201cI can look up the relevant competencies and get answers.\u201d\n\nThe SHRM Certified Professional (SHRM-CP) and SHRM Senior Certified\nProfessional (SHRM-SCP) certifications are built on a behavior model known as\nthe [SHRM Body of Competency and\nKnowledge](/certification/about/bodyofcompetencyknowledge/pages/default.aspx)\n(BoCK). That framework, which is based on extensive global research that\ngathered information from employers, academics and HR practitioners,\nidentifies what it takes to be a successful HR professional across the\nperformance continuum, around the world, and from early to executive career\nlevels.\n\nThe BoCK includes eight behavioral competencies\u2014Business Acumen,\nCommunication, Consultation, Critical Evaluation, Ethical Practice, Global &\nCultural Effectiveness, Leadership & Navigation, and Relationship\nManagement\u2014plus one technical competency, HR Expertise.\n\n![](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/c_crop%2ch_1389%2cw_1389%2cx_1028%2cy_400/c_fit%2cf_auto%2cq_auto%2cw_767/v1/Magazine/Melanie_Olsen_jqnqkp)\n\n\"When I end up being pulled in multiple directions at once, the faster I can\napply my knowledge to make an effective decision and act on it, the better.\"\n\nThe model is designed to help HR professionals identify the information they\nneed for any given situation\u2014quickly. \u201cWhen I end up being pulled in multiple\ndirections at once, the faster I can apply my knowledge to make an effective\ndecision and act on it, the better,\u201d says Melanie Olsen, SHRM-CP, an HR\nmanager for 3M\u2014a multinational corporation based in St. Paul, Minn.\n\nAs the immediate past president of the Twin Cities Human Resource Association,\nOlsen was an early adopter of the SHRM Competency Model and certification.\n\nSince earning her certification, she has been dedicated to mastering the eight\nbehavioral competencies while also understanding and gaining experience across\nall of the HR functional areas covered under the HR Expertise competency\u2014from\ntalent acquisition and retention to employee relations and from risk\nmanagement to business strategy. She says doing so builds her credibility and\nmakes her work more meaningful to her organization by positively affecting\nbusiness growth and employee satisfaction.\n\n\u201cThis is especially true when your employer is a dynamic global company, like\nmine, that often has layers of complexity,\u201d Olsen says.\n\nFor Hunter, one of the biggest benefits of certification has been the way the\nlearning process has sharpened her own already-strong critical-thinking skills\nand helped her apply them to the business.\n\n\u201cI am always the \u2018what if\u2019 person at meetings,\u201d she explains. \u201c \u2018If it works\nwell here, how can we apply it there?\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor example, when Hunter\u2019s former employer needed to relocate an international\nemployee to the U.S., she was involved in several meetings about how to work\nout the details. By knowing what questions to ask about relevant laws and\nlogistics\u2014and where to find the answers\u2014she was able to help the worker make a\nsmooth transition.\n\nBecause of the SHRM Competency Model\u2019s strong focus on many aspects of\nbusiness, some professionals who work outside the HR sphere have found it\nuseful as well\u2014such as Stefan A. Mecke,  SHRM-SCP, a shareholder with law firm\nBarber & Bartz in Tulsa, Okla. He obtained his SHRM certification to forge a\nconnection and common knowledge base with his HR clients.\n\n\u201cI see how HR plays a role in the bigger picture, and we are missing it if we\ndon\u2019t have that connection with the HR world,\u201d Mecke says.\n\nThe certifications can bring the HR community closer as well. When HR\nprofessionals see Olsen\u2019s SHRM-CP credential on her LinkedIn profile or name\nbadge at a conference, they often ask her about it.\n\n\u201cMany times, the questions they have are about the certification itself,\u201d she\nsays. \u201c \u2018Should I get it? What are the benefits? Is it hard to obtain?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThese conversations give her an opportunity to share her experiences, grow her\nHR network and promote her local SHRM chapter. \u201cHR professionals are often so\nbusy developing others that they neglect their own development,\u201d she says.\n\u201cSHRM certification ensures you don\u2019t forget about yourself.\u201d\n\n##  Anthony Ray, SHRM-CP\n\n![](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/c_crop%2ch_1350%2cw_2400%2cx_0%2cy_92/c_fit%2cf_auto%2cq_auto%2cw_767/v1/Magazine/HR_007_eekozt)Executive\nDirector of Human Resources, Morton College, Chicago Metro Area\n\nAfter working for a major airline for more than 20 years, Ray moved into a\nrole with HR responsibilities\u2014which prompted him to get certified.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about the value of the SHRM certification,\u201d he says. \u201cA true\nHR professional uses the competencies every day. From Consultation to\nLeadership & Navigation to Business Acumen\u2014it fits what I do on a daily\nbasis.\u201d\n\nLeadership & Navigation\n\nRay says the competency he uses most in his current position is Leadership &\nNavigation, which SHRM defines as the ability to direct and contribute to\ninitiatives and processes within the organization. Proficiency in this area\ncan lead to decreased turnover and improved job satisfaction and performance.\n\n  \n\nThe Competency in Action\n\nWhen Ray\u2019s HR department must make changes to the compensation structure, job\nclassifications or other areas, Ray compiles and analyzes data to show the\nbottom-line cost of each HR decision. \u201cIt\u2019s also useful to provide the\nleadership team with comparative data about what other organizations have\ndone,\u201d he says.\n\nMaking the Business Case\n\n\u201cPrior to my arrival, my former employer was using paper performance\nevaluations for its nonunion employees that didn\u2019t cover any of the goals in\nthe strategic plan,\u201d he says. The company was also approving the same flat\nraises across the board.\n\nHe and his team drew on the Leadership & Navigation competency to convince the\nsenior team that annual increases should be tied to employee performance and\nthe company\u2019s strategic goals. Then they rolled out a digital process for\ndoing so.\n\n\"There\u2019s no doubt about the value of the SHRM certification.\"  \n\n\u201cDuring the merit increase period, we were able to present a documented case\nfor every employee increase that was requested,\u201d he says. \u201cThis process took\nthree months of meeting with different departments and decision-makers to get\ntheir buy-in.\u201d\n\nThe competencies underscored for him that he must make a business case even\nfor the best and most established HR practices. \u201cI can\u2019t just walk into the\nC-suite and say, \u2018This is what we have to do,\u2019 \u201d he says.\n\n##  Stefan A. Mecke, SHRM-SCP\n\n![](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/c_crop%2ch_1211%2cw_2153%2cx_0%2cy_0/c_fit%2cf_auto%2cq_auto%2cw_767/v1/Magazine/Stefan_3_exgt5q)Relationship\nManagement\n\nAttorney, Barber & Bartz, Tulsa, Okla.\n\nAlthough Mecke has a law degree and an MBA, he wanted to sharpen his HR\nskills. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of day-to-day HR stuff that lawyers don\u2019t get brought\ninto,\u201d he says.\n\nThe certification-preparation materials introduced Mecke to myriad relevant\nconcepts. \u201cNow I feel like I\u2019m a specialist with up-to-date knowledge.\u201d\n\nHe also feels more kinship with those who work in HR. \u201cPeople are very social\nin that community,\u201d he notes. \u201cThey share knowledge and ideas and build\nrelationships within the local chapter. That\u2019s been a big deal.\u201d\n\n  \n\nSHRM certification gave Mecke more confidence in Relationship Management,\nwhich focuses on maintaining productive interpersonal relationships and\nhelping others do the same. This competency is about establishing credibility\nand building engaging relationships with stakeholders.\n\nThe Competency in Action\n\nAfter earning his certification, Mecke got more involved with his local SHRM\nchapter. \u201cI started getting out into the community more and learning about\nthings that would better serve my clients,\u201d he says.\n\nAt one event, he met with HR professionals who were talking about how they\nwere handling coming layoffs. Building and maintaining relationships with HR\nprofessionals helps him stay in tune with the issues that his clients tackle\nevery day.\n\nHe also started speaking publicly on HR topics and writing articles for Tulsa\nLawyer, a local magazine published by the county bar association.\n\n\u201cSHRM certification has really given me confidence to do some of these\nthings.\u201d\n\nCritical Evaluation\n\nMecke was recently contacted by an HR manager to assist with a discrimination\nclaim that an employee had filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC).\n\n\u201cHaving an understanding of HR best practices was critical in assessing the\ncompany\u2019s position and the appropriate response to the discrimination claim,\u201d\nhe says. \u201cI needed to fully understand everything the company did and gauge\nthese actions against industry HR best practices in order to properly advise\nthe HR manager.\u201d\n\nTogether, Mecke and the client determined that voluntary EEOC mediation would\nbe the best solution.\n\n##  Vanessa Alvarado Guevara, SHRM-CP\n\n![](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/c_crop%2ch_1519%2cw_2700%2cx_0%2cy_288/c_fit%2cf_auto%2cq_auto%2cw_767/v1/Magazine/20170322-LA2_1956_2_fcqcoj)Alvarado\nGuevara has been responsible for many aspects of human resources in her more\nthan 20 years spent in the medical device industry. She\u2019s also a former\npresident of the Puerto Rico SHRM chapter, which has more than 1,000 members.\n\nGlobal & Cultural Effectiveness\n\nAlvarado Guevara finds the Global & Cultural Effectiveness competency\nparticularly useful. HR professionals who have mastered this competency value\nand consider the perspectives and backgrounds of all parties in global\nbusiness. That means respecting and understanding the differences in rules,\ncustoms, laws and business operations among cultures and building cross-\ncultural relationships and partnerships.\n\nThe Competency in Action\n\nAlvarado Guevara helped build cross-cultural partnerships as part of the team\nthat led an effort to offer SHRM\u2019s certification-preparation training and\nmaterials in Spanish. Now HR professionals can take the exam in either English\nor Spanish, which creates opportunities for more professionals to hone their\nskills and connect with the HR community.\n\nConsultation\n\nAlvarado Guevara says she was coaching an HR professional who was extremely\ntalented and wanted to transition from an administrator to an HR advisor role.\n\n\u201cAn HR advisor needs to provide guidance,\u201d she says, \u201cso to transition to the\nnext level, I told this coachee that she needed to think about herself as a\nconsultant. We sat down together and looked at the key Consultation behaviors\nfor advanced HR professionals.\u201d\n\nThose behaviors include:\n\n  * Designing strategic HR and business solutions.   \n\n  * Coaching executives on people management issues.  \n\n  * Listening to business leaders\u2019 challenges.  \n\n  * Identifying creative solutions for the organization and its business units.  \n\n\u201cWhen we \u2026 read through the behaviors of the senior-level HR person, it\nsparked her own self-discovery process to develop goals and objectives,\u201d\nAlvarado Guevara says. \u201cShe was able to identify the necessary behaviors to\nadvance her skills in those areas, which helped her transition to the next\nlevel.\u201d\n\n  \n\n_Lisa Nagele-Piazza, J.D., SHRM-SCP, is SHRM\u2019s senior legal editor.  \nCover Photo: Kimberly Hunter, SHRM-SCP.

But while\ndiversity and inclusion policies typically focus on overcoming biases based on\nrace, ethnicity, disability, age, gender and sexual orientation, hundreds of\nmillions of people are affected by another bias because they are not native\nspeakers of the English language. Studies show that nonnative English speakers\nare considered by native English speakers as less successful, intelligent and\nbelievable than other native English speakers.  \n\nEnglish is the common language of global business. Companies such as Siemens,\nNissan, Honda, Sodexo, Rakuten and Renault have adopted English as their\nofficial working language. More than 1.5 billion people speak English, but\nabout 75 percent are nonnative speakers. There is an expectation among hiring\nmanagers and HR professionals that employees will be able to speak English at\na \"useful\" level, even if it is not their first language. Yet there is little\nor no expectation that native English speakers should have to learn a foreign\nlanguage to be successful.\n\nLearning to speak English as a second language (ESL) requires commitment and\nhard work. However, research by Mayflower College in Plymouth, England,\nsuggests that ESL speakers are rarely given the credit they deserve, and there\nappears to be considerable unconscious bias against them.\n\nIn one study, the psycholinguist Shiri Lev-Ari, Ph.D., asked nonnative English\nspeakers to record statements such as \"Ants don't sleep\" in English. Native\nEnglish speakers recorded the same statements. When native English speakers\nrated the recordings for their veracity, they rated the speakers with the\nheaviest accents as least true, while native speakers were rated the truest.\n\n\"We're less likely to believe something if it's said with a foreign accent,\"\nLev-Ari said.\n\nMagda Bowyer, a U.S. citizen who is originally from Poland, said, \"It often\nhappened to me that a customer questioned my answer to a problem simply\nbecause of my accent. I was told, 'I don't think you understand what I am\nsaying. Can I talk to someone else?' They acknowledged [my answer] only after\nthey heard the same answer in 'perfect' English.\"\n\nResearch shows that we need to have diversity of opinion to make better\nworkplace decisions. But bias\u2014[whether conscious or\nunconscious](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-\ncultural-effectiveness/pages/putting-humanity-into-hr-compliance-become-aware-\nof-unconscious-bias.aspx)\u2014against nonnative English speakers causes \"the\nsilencing effect.\" They can feel isolated and excluded, and team meetings are\nless valuable as a result.\n\n\"I notice that native English speakers tend to take over during project\nmeetings,\" said Lennert Visser, a quality manager for a multinational\norganization in the Netherlands. \"They will start jumping in when nonnative\nspeakers leave time and space or are slow in coming back with replies.\nSometimes we just need more time to formulate our thoughts in English.\"\n\nSome say this issue is even more problematic. \"This goes beyond unconscious\nbias and is very much a form of classism, and elitism even,\" said Sarah Saska,\na diversity and inclusion specialist in Toronto. \"I'm always taken aback when\nnative English speakers tease, correct or even mock those who speak English as\na second language.\"\n\nThis communication barrier isn't confined to formal meetings. Information\nflows, team unity and career progression can be built just as effectively in\ninformal settings, such as over lunch or at get-togethers after work, as in\nstructured interactions like meetings.\n\nWhose Language Is It, Anyway?\n\nExperts note the irony that the very people who are struggling to have their\nvoices heard at work due to English language differences are the same people\nhaving a huge impact on the evolution of global English. The nature of the\nEnglish language is changing. Pronunciation, vocabulary and grammar have been\nadapted as English reflects the first languages of international speakers.\nEnglish as a \"[lingua franca](https://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/lingua%20franca) (ELF)\" may be spoken with a Spanish\ntwist, an Italian rhythm and a Japanese lilt.\n\nResearch has found that native English speakers often have a negative\nemotional response to ELF, regarding it as erroneous and substandard. \"It is\neasy to dismiss ELF as the use of incorrect English by people who have not\nlearned it very well, but it is an entirely natural linguistic development, an\nexample of how any language varies and changes as it is appropriated by\ndifferent communities of users,\" according to Barbara Seidlhofer, professor at\nthe University of Vienna.\n\nNative English speakers may be responsible for more communication breakdowns\nthan they realize. It isn't just how native speakers view English that causes\nproblems; it's also how they use it.\n\nMayflower College research on 1,000 nonnative English speakers showed that 88\npercent find it more difficult to communicate with a native English speaker\nthan with another nonnative speaker, because native speakers typically don't\nknow how to adjust their English for their audience.\n\nAirline pilot Dimitri Kovalov, a native Russian, illustrated the point from\nthe safety-critical world of aviation: \"I still have bad dreams about the\nfirst time I flew to the U.S. I was an experienced pilot, and my English was\nOK, but when the air traffic controller asked me, 'How are you riding today?'\nI had no idea. I understood the words but not the meaning. In fact, he meant,\n'Is the flight bumpy? Is there turbulence?' It's a scary thing when you're\nflying a plane and you don't understand an instruction or a question!\"\n\nCreating an effective language management strategy within a diversity and\ninclusion plan requires going beyond raising awareness of unconscious bias\nagainst international speakers of English, say language experts. It needs to\nhelp native speakers adjust the way they communicate with their international\ncolleagues and customers. But why are many native English speakers so bad at\nthis effort?\n\nSome have accused native English speakers of having a sense of superiority,\neven \"linguistic imperialism,\" which they voice by saying such things as, \"I'm\na native English speaker; therefore, the problem cannot be mine. It must be\nyours.\"\n\nMany in the U.K. and the U.S. fail to fully understand and empathize with the\nchallenges faced by nonnative speakers because they do not learn foreign\nlanguages. Education systems in English-speaking countries typically reward\nthe use of idiomatic, \"sophisticated\" language. This is usually the opposite\nof what is needed when communicating with international English speakers\u2014when\ntolerance and understanding are most needed.\n\nNative English speakers who learn a second language are applauded for their\nintelligence and hard work. However, the same isn't true for nonnative English\nspeakers. \"In France, it's no longer a bonus to have English on your resume.\n... It's just considered normal, something which is expected,\" said Jean-\nPierre Blavac, a postgraduate student in Toulouse, France.\n\nLanguage training solutions have traditionally been designed to enable ESL\nspeakers to improve their English. However, it may be time to consider the\nrole of the native English speaker, as well.\n\nKim Min-seo, a financial analyst from South Korea, eloquently explained the\nchallenge: \"I really find it difficult when I go to our office in the U.K.\nMost of the other people have English as their first language, and sometimes I\nhave no idea what they are talking about, especially when they are talking\nwith each other. I just wish they could slow down a bit. It makes me feel\nstupid ... a little bit humiliated.\"\n\nTo address this issue, language pros suggest that native English speakers do\nthe following:\n\n  * Learn how to filter and adapt their English when communicating with nonnative speakers.\n  * Become more empathetic to the challenges faced by their international colleagues and customers.\n  * Change any unconscious bias they have that their opinion somehow matters more because they can say it in \"perfect\" English.\n\nChange Is Rarely Easy\n\nPeople tend to react with anger and irritation when confronted about their\nbiases. But that is no reason not to confront them. The cost of behavioral\nchange is not much when compared with the benefits. Albert Einstein summed up\nthis concept rather well: \"The world as we have created it is a process of our\nthinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.\"\n\n _Paul Stevens is the CEO of Mayflower College in Plymouth, United Kingdom. _\n\n  \n\n[Language](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Language)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Viewpoint%3a+The+Silencing+of+ESL+Speakers&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-cultural-\neffectiveness/Pages/Viewpoint-The-Silencing-of-ESL-Speakers.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

experts has provided insights into the role of HR professionals at the launch of Swinburne's refreshed Master of Human Resource Management\n  * The Master of Human Resource Management has been co-developed with Swinburne's partners Siemens and Medibank\n\nHuman resource (HR) professionals need to be data-driven, people-focused and\ntech-savvy in the rapidly transforming world of work, four industry experts\nhave said at the launch of Swinburne's refreshed [Master of Human Resource\nManagement](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/study/course/Master-of-Human-\nResource-Management-MA-HRM/local).\n\nDeloitte Access Economics forecasts the [demand for human resource\nprofessionals](https://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/pages/economics/articles/future-\nof-work-occupational-education-trends.html) will grow by almost 8,000 people\nover the next five years to 2023 - an annual growth rate of 2.5 per cent.\n\nThe HR professionals from Medibank, PaperCut, Siemens and PACCAR Australia\nshared insights into how HR leaders can help their organisations thrive.\n\n## Data-informed decisions\n\nUsing data analytics and metrics is now a core competency in HR, says Robert\nBrierley formerly from PACCAR Australia, a global leader in the design and\nmanufacture of trucks.\n\n\"If you're going to come up with a new HR initiative, you need to be able to\njustify it with the numbers and make a case for why there is a business need.\nIt is no different in that way to other business operations like marketing or\nIT.\"\n\nData can also show employee sentiment that in turn can be used to shape a\nbetter employee experience, which General Manager of People and Culture for\nthe private health insurer Medibank, Melissa Wong, says is a key role of HR.\n\n\"Using data we can look at things like what time someone swipes in to what\ntime they are sending emails at night\u2026through the staff intranet system you\ncan then actively push out content about resilience or health and\nwellbeing\u2026that's the potential we have in terms of the metrics to improve the\nemployee experience.\"\n\nSwinburne Adjunct Professor and HR professional, Gaynor Witts, says some\norganisations are using data to inform employee retention strategies.\n\n\"I've seen one company use data to see that somewhere between year three and\nfour of employment there was a drop off, whereas if an employee stayed five\nyears they would likely stay much longer.\"\n\n\"As a result of having that information they were able to target a development\nprogram for people in year three and four and saw really quickly that the\ndrop-off rate significantly decreased.\"\n\n## People-first approach\n\nRelational abilities and influential skills are some of the key attributes HR\nprofessionals should have, says Ms Wong from Medibank.  \n\n\"One of the most important things we can do is have our ear to the ground and\nunderstand the dynamics of the workplace\u2026because quite often people come to us\nfor counsel and advice about other people,\" she says.\n\n\"The ability to build rapport is also important so people know to come to you\nwhen things happen\u2026then to be able to have influential conversations after\nthat is critically important.\"\n\n## Embracing flexible working\n\nAdam Axon from PaperCut says technology enables his organisation to support\nremote workers.  \n\nPaperCut is a print management software startup that has grown to 200\nemployees across three offices, with many employees working remotely.\n\n\"We use technology to make sure if someone is remote that they are 'always\non', we have a screen in the office to hook up a permanent video link and we\nhave good microphones set up so that when our team are collaborating they can\nchime into the conversations.\"\n\nHe says it is vital to make remote workers feel like a valued part of the\nteam, which can be shown in small ways.  \n\n\"When we have an office party we always have donuts\u2026 for our people who work\nremotely, we send them a donut voucher at the start of the year to help them\nfeel included.\"\n\nThe HR experts agree that organisations should not try to roll out a 'one size\nfits all' approach.\n\n\"Flexible working has to be tailored to the individual's needs\u2026there should be\nguidelines as opposed to rules,\" says Ms Wong.\n\nMr Axon says people's experiences differ depending on where they are located.\n\n\"If you strive for too much consistency you might lose something special.\nCreate frameworks rather than policies and allow for people to have scope\nwithin those bounds.\"\n\n##

Businesses are also dealing with newer talent challenges. In the IT\nsector, for instance, there is an ongoing focus on creating a leaner middle\nand senior management layer even as companies are hiring extensively at the\nentry level. This is a trend that is linked directly to the skills gap\nchallenge \u2013 where fresh candidates are being trained with new skills, while\nexperienced workers unwilling to upskill are fired.\n\nIn order to navigate growth or to drive productivity, companies need to find\nthe right talent. 42% of the companies that participated in Mercer-Mettl\u2019s\n\u201cTech hiring and technology adoption trends 2019\u201d study said that they are\nunable to source the desired quality of candidates. This is despite the fact\nthat companies already using a number of screening tools which include a\ncombination of MCQ and coding simulators, paper based and white board\ntechnical assessments. According to the same report, companies are planning to\nincrease their tech hiring by 21% over the last year. And the success of the\ntech hiring process rate is currently only 50 percent, on average.\n\nTo make the most of the process, companies need to be able to evaluate a\ncandidate holistically \u2013 they need to assess their technical knowledge,\nbehavioural competencies and readiness. For the first time, companies have\naccess to tools that can measure learning readiness as well as skill\nproximity. Raghavendra K, Vice President and Head, Human Resources, Infosys\nBPM said that \u2018holistic assessments\u2019 are extremely critical. He added that a\ndedicated Center of Excellence (COE) at the company evaluates existing\ncompetencies, their potential and readiness of the talent.\n\nAs the number of companies strategizing for the future rises, here\u2019s how\ncompanies can identify the skills they need for the future:\n\n### 1\\. Define a competency framework\n\nOne way of breaking down the job requirements for the future is by identifying\ndifferent competencies by categories of skills needed in the form of a\n\u2018competency framework\u2019. The aim is to break down competencies according to\ncognitive skills, behavioral skills and technical/domain specific skills.\nAligning specific competencies to jobs can help identify current and future\ncandidates.\n\nFor example, take the case of a financial analyst \u2013 the domain specific\nknowledge would knowledge about the Balance sheet reconciliation, Accounts\nreceivable/ payable. The behavioral skills could include planning and\norganization, stress management, establishing trust, teamwork etc., while the\ncognitive skills would include numerical reasoning, analytical ability,\nproblem solving etc. This step can include any emerging skills either in\ntechnology or experience in working in cross functional teams etc.,\n\n### 2\\. Align assessments mapped to the jobs\n\nThe next step in ensuring that you\u2019re identifying the right talent for the job\nis to ensure that you assess candidates based on these competencies. By\naligning assessments for the job, not only can employees be upskilled,\nprospective candidates can also be directly assessed.\n\nAt Infosys, Raghavendra pointed out that the hiring and role change\nconsideration requests are linked to the company\u2019s competency framework.\n\n\u201cVirtual assessments, leadership assessments,360-Degree assessments are linked\nto the Infosys BPM competency framework that enable the company to strengthen\ndata-driven decision making for role change considerations. In addition to\nproviding insights on learning & development interventions, the assessments\nhelp in talent pipeline building, career development, talent engagement and\nretention,\u201d he said.\n\n### 3\\. Measure impact and work on the feedback\n\nAssessments can help bring a qualitative shift in hiring. The costs incurred\non hiring the wrong candidates and losing productivity at work can be brought\ndown by hiring for the right fit. Speaking about the impact of holistic talent\nassessments, Sheetal Sandhu, CHRO, ICRA noted that \u201cholistic talent\nassessments lead to significant results, including productivity increase, cost\nsavings, decreased attrition.\u201d\n\nAdministering tests online also cuts down on the time. It offers a quick and\nhassle free process that speeds up the hiring process. \u201cOrganizations using\nimmersive, compelling assessments experiences with technology enabled online\nassessments are seeing immediate results and feedback,\u201d Sheetal said.\n\n### 4\\. Keep up with new content and assessments\n\nOne of the key challenges in administering tests on future readiness is\nstaying up to date on advances in testing content and methods. Unless a\ncompany has access to a dedicated team that can monitor and plug-in\ndevelopments across the business and map them to future needs, there\u2019s little\nprogress that companies can make themselves. This is where the effectiveness\nof specialists can greatly reduce the work and effort needed to bring best\npractices.\n\n\u201cFocusing on industry specific best practices is knowledge that most companies\nneed, but not all companies can afford to invest in. This is where specialist\nassessment experts come in. They can help map your hiring needs to future-\nlooking trends with benchmarked data,\u201d said Siddhartha Gupta, CEO, Mercer\nMettl. Having access to such data can help align the business needs to\nindustry shifts.\n\nHiring the right candidate necessitates a strong understanding of the market,\nand being able to articulate what your ideal candidate should look like in the\ncontext of your company\u2019s culture. As new jobs emerge, and old ones get\naugmented with the power of automation, having a robust skills roadmap is the\nonly way to weather the uncertain storm. Continuous digital transformation is\nchanging the landscape of business \u2013 right from the way companies allocate\nresources, the way they innovate and how they hire.\n\nCompanies need to invest not just in identifying the right courses, but they\nneed to continuously ensure that the program is personalized to the learning\nneeds of the employee. The input about the method of learning \u2013 whether that\u2019s\nformal learning programs like classroom sessions etc., or informal learning\nchannels like byte sized learning tools, gamification tools and so on needs to\nbe aligned to the content. Assessments can help in understand the\neffectiveness of the content, the learning delivery as well as the learning\npotential of the employee.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics:\n[Assessments](/category/assessment/assessments?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=assessments\n\"Browse more in: Assessments\"), [Behavioural\nAssessments](/category/assessment/behavioural-\nassessments?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=behavioural-assessments\n\"Browse more in: Behavioural Assessments\"), [Strategic\nHR](/category/leadership-strategy/strategic-\nhr?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=strategic-hr \"Browse more in: Strategic\nHR\"), [#DecodeTalent](/tag/decode-\ntalent?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=decode-talent \"Browse more in:\nDecodeTalent\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Authors\n\n[![J Jerry Moses](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1442828069/authors/j-jerry-\nmoses.jpg)](/author/j-jerry-moses)\n\n#### [J Jerry Moses](/author/j-jerry-moses)\n\nJ Jerry Moses is a Content Manager at People Matters.

Now, these managers focus more on people than on paper and,\nlike skilled teachers, they help both the strugglers and the stars. And in the\nfuture? Expect those in HR (if it's still called that) to be akin to\nchampionship coaches, guiding employees throughout their careers and becoming\nmore essential than ever to business analytics and strategy.\n\nThe role of the HR professional has changed dramatically along with the\nworkforce and economy, and that evolution will continue as machines and\ntechnology replace tasks once performed by humans. But that doesn't make\npeople\u2015or the HR teams that work with them\u2015any less important. Tomorrow's HR\nleaders will need to be bigger, broader thinkers, and they'll have to be tech-\nsavvy and nimble enough to deal with an increasingly agile and restless\nworkforce.\n\n\"I think we're going to see HR positions [develop] in such a way that [they]\nwill probably be one of the most sought-out professions in the enterprise,\"\nsays Jill Goldstein, global practice lead for talent and HR operations at\nmanagement consulting firm [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/new-\napplied-now) in the Miami area. \"I can envision a future where HR\nprofessionals are no longer thinking that their job is to stay on top of\ncurrent HR trends, but to reposition [themselves] to become workforce\nadvisors.\"  \n\n\u200bTechnology is freeing up HR to take on bigger-picture matters, making the\nfield more exciting, more demanding and perhaps more competitive as well. \"We\nused to be about compliance, party planning and benefits,\" says Tracie\nSponenberg, SHRM-SCP, senior vice president of human resources at The Granite\nGroup, a wholesale plumbing supplies distributor in Concord, N.H. \"To some\nextent, there are still some companies that see HR as a purely tactical kind\nof role. But the good ones, the smart ones, see HR as a strategic partner.\"  \n\n##  We\u2019ve Come a Long Way\n\n\u200bHR has greatly evolved since one of the earliest HR departments (called\n\"personnel management\") was created in 1901 in response to a strike at the\nNational Cash Register Co. in Dayton, Ohio. It wasn't until after World War II\nthat the public embraced the idea of a human resources department to handle\nemployees. And in the latter half of the 20th century, a slew of work-related\nlaws\u2014including the Equal Pay Act (1963), the Civil Rights Act (1964), and the\nFamily and Medical Leave Act (1993)\u2014made the presence of HR specialists even\nmore important.  \n\n\u2018I can envision a future where HR professionals are no longer thinking that\ntheir job is to stay on top of current HR trends, but to reposition\n[themselves] to become workforce advisors.\u2019  \nJill Goldstein\n\nNowadays, the stock of the HR professional is rising, with some practitioners\nbeing asked to join the C-suite instead of just visiting it. Many\norganizations are ditching the title \"HR manager\" for monikers such as chief\nhappiness officer, director of talent-attraction strategy and even head of\noptimistic people. Future titles are likely to reflect the growing focus on\ntechnology and analytics in the field, says Jonathan Kestenbaum, managing\ndirector of New York City-based [Talent Tech\nLabs](https://talenttechlabs.com/), a talent acquisition software company.\n\nIt's that technology that will help HR adjust to a changing workforce\naccustomed to going online to get everything from a date to groceries. HR\ndepartments will need to make more information and services available to\nworkers around the clock\u2015a shift that will also free up time to focus more on\nbusiness strategy and employee career paths.  \n\n  \n\n![](https://cdn.shrm.org/image/upload/c_crop%2ch_720%2cw_1280%2cx_0%2cy_0/c_fit%2cf_auto%2cq_auto%2cw_767/v1/Magazine/1118_Milligan_chart_pwmdrh)  \n\n\u200bEven if your job title or your responsibilities have yet to change, it's\nimperative to start adapting to the new reality now. You can begin by\nenhancing your skills in seven critical areas that analysts say are key to\nfuture success in the profession and likely to be widely practiced by 2025.\nThey include business strategy, analytics and, of course, people.  \n\n _[SHRM members-only resource : [Accelerate Your\nCareer](/LearningAndCareer/Career/Pages/Accelerate-Your-Career.aspx)]_  \n\n##  1\\. Embrace Technology and Analytics\n\n\u200bSavvy HR departments are already using analytics to predict and assess\neverything from employee retention to recruitment strategies to the success of\nwellness programs. For example, chatbots allow candidates and employees to\nhave automated, personalized conversations with a computer. A worker could use\na chatbot to find out how many sick or vacation days he has remaining or what\nprocedures the company's dental plan covers. And a job candidate can answer\nquestions, complete assessments, and track the status of his or her\napplication through a personalized assistant who has a name, a face and a\npleasant demeanor. Of course, all these features are computer-generated.\n\nMillennials, now the largest generation in the workplace, are used to getting\ninformation right away through a computer or smartphone. A wide range of\nemployee experiences, then\u2014from application to onboarding to checking benefits\nand paid time off\u2014should be available online to accommodate the digital\ncustomer experience younger workers prefer, and HR should be managing that\neffort.\n\n\"Technology is enabling us to provide employees with a more consumer type of\npresence at work, with a greater ability to have richer digital experiences\nand find what they need 24/7,\" says Larry Nash, U.S. director of recruiting at\nconsulting company [EY](https://www.ey.com/us/en/home) in Pittsburgh.  \n\n\u200bFreed from such mundane tasks as processing payroll, answering benefits\nquestions and scheduling interviews, HR will have more time for strategic\nplanning. Human resources \"can go from being a steward of employment to being\na steward of work,\" says Ravin Jesuthasan, a managing director in the Chicago\noffice at HR consultancy [Willis Towers\nWatson](https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en). \"It may be the pathway to what\nwe aspire to be\u2015the trusted advisor.\"  \n\n##  2\\. Understand How the Company Succeeds\n\n\u200bIt's not enough to be conversant in the language of HR. Human resource\nprofessionals need to know and contribute to the vision, mission and financial\nsuccess of the business\u2015otherwise, they won't be taken seriously by the\nC-suite. And on a practical level, they won't be able to execute effective\nworkforce planning or attract, hire and train the right talent, experts say.\n\n\"I see HR lacking, literally, core competency in the businesses they manage\nevery day,\" says Amelia Ransom, senior director of engagement and diversity at\nSeattle-based [Avalera](https://www.avalara.com/simplify/en/avatax/avalara-\nbrand.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3srB8q-d3gIVhAOGCh2LxwSmEAAYASAAEgKWrvD_BwE&CampaignID=7010b000000eP0wAAE&st-t=all_visitors&ef_id=EAIaIQobChMI3srB8q-d3gIVhAOGCh2LxwSmEAAYASAAEgKWrvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL%215131%213%21278193500631%21p%21%21g%21%21avalera&lso=Paid%20Digital&lsmr=Paid%20Digital),\na tax software business. Beyond knowing the company's stock price and how to\nread a profit and loss statement, HR leaders need to understand the strategic\ndirection of the business and the economic and social environment in which the\ncompany operates. They need to anticipate and prepare for changes in work and\nthe workforce. Only then can HR leaders effectively manage human capital and\nalign HR initiatives with the organization's goals.\n\n\"HR professionals need to understand something about how business and\ncompanies work. What does the CEO worry about? What does the CFO worry about?\"\nsays Janine Walter, chief talent officer at Epic Holdings, a financial firm in\nthe New York City area. As HR moves into the C-suite, it needs to start acting\nlike part of the executive team.  \n\n\u200bHR Jobs of the Future  \n\n\u200bAs the nature of HR and of work itself changes, so will the skills you'll\nneed to do your job. What HR jobs could be in your future? Experts offer their\npredictions:  \n  \n---  \n\u200b **HR data scientist/chief technology officer.** Data and analytics will\nincreasingly drive the job of HR\u2015and this is the person who will head the\neffort.  \n  \n **Employee experience specialist.** This HR professional will focus on the\nentire worker relationship with the company, from benefits to training to\ncareer trajectory.\u200b  \n\u200b **Head of talent-acquisition technology selection.** New talent acquisition\nplatforms are emerging and evolving. This specialist will comb through them to\nfind those most appropriate for the organization.  \n  \n **Head of candidate experience.** The hiring process should provide job\ncandidates with all the speed, convenience and efficiency of the best online\nconsumer experiences. This person will oversee that effort, ensuring that\napplications do not simply go into a \"black box.\"\u200b  \n\u200b **Performance coach.** This HR specialist will help maximize the individual\ncontributions of both management and nonmanagement staff.  \n  \n\u200b **Organizational psychologist.** While not technically an HR position,\norganizational or industrial psychologists use the principles of psychology to\ndevelop a more holistic approach to HR, marketing and sales.  \n  \n\u200b  \n  \n##  3\\. Stay Focused on People\n\n\u200bEmbracing technology doesn't mean taking humans out of the equation. In fact,\nHR managers in 2025 will have more time to focus on individuals, enhancing\nboth recruitment and retention. At Cisco, executive vice president Fran\nKatsoudas' title changed from HR officer to chief people officer. She sees\nthat as a sign that her job is morphing from mitigating risk and ensuring\ncompliance to executing business strategies.  \n\n\u2018Today, technology is bringing a level of intelligence to HR that really\nthrusts HR into a compelling consultancy role.\u2019  \nFran Katsoudas\n\n\"Today, technology is bringing a level of intelligence to HR that really\nthrusts HR into a compelling consultancy role,\" she says, noting that's how\nthe HR team at Cisco now functions. The team is also more focused on coaching\nand management issues.\n\nAdditionally, top HR professionals of tomorrow could become what Goldstein\ncalls \"talent brokers\" and coaches who help to guide the individual careers of\neveryone at the office, says Sponenberg, who is a member of the [Society for\nHuman Resource Management's HR Disciplines Special Expertise\nPanel](/membership/volunteers/special-expertise-panels/pages/default.aspx).  \n\n\u200bWith competition fierce for good talent, successful HR managers need to give\ntop workers a reason to come to work for them. \"If you're not in a global\nbusiness now, you're going to be competing with global businesses for the very\nbest employees,\" says Judy Collister, executive vice president and human\nresource officer at Cleveland-based Park Place Technologies, a data center\nsupport company. \"You need to create an environment where people enjoy being\nthere and can't imagine being anywhere else.\"  \n\n##  4\\. Be Ready for the New Workforce\n\n\u200bThe 2025 workforce will include not just transient workers (60 percent of\nMillennials told Gallup they are open to new job opportunities) but also gig\nworkers who pop in and out of jobs on a daily basis. In addition, HR will need\nto help assess which tasks throughout the organization can be automated and\nthen reskill those whose jobs are affected by automation. A recent Willis\nTowers Watson survey found that more than half of employers say it will take\n\"breakthrough approaches in HR's role\" to deal with automation and\ndigitalization. Meanwhile, some of HR's remote workers will increasingly be\nvery remote\u2015as in, seven or 10 time zones away\u2015as globalization leads to an\nincreasingly diverse workforce.  \n\nHR Roles Are Already Evolving\u200b  \n  \n  \n---  \n\u200bSome new HR roles focus on creating a powerful employee experience that\nmirrors the customer experience, says workplace futurist Jeanne Meister.\nExamples of those roles and the people filling them include:  \n  \n  \n  * \u200bMelissa Werneck, senior vice president of global HR, performance and IT at Kraft Heinz. Werneck has a **combined responsibility for the HR and IT functions** , leveraging machine learning techniques and sophisticated algorithms to automate work and create a consumer experience for employees.  \n\n  \n  \n  * \u200bAnshul Sheopuri, IBM's vice president of data, artificial intelligence and offering strategy. Sheopuri **oversees HR's use of data to proactively retain employees** and enhance internal career mobility with learning opportunities and personalized job alerts based on their skills.  \n\n  \n  \n  * \u200bAshar Khan, director of people analytics at Kraft Heinz. Data-driven initiatives already under way include predicting employee retention and **suggesting which employees in the company are likely deserving of recognition** through a merit increase.  \n\n  \n  \n##  5\\. Market a Modern Benefits Package\n\n\u200bAttracting and keeping talent involves offering (and administering) a\nbenefits package that appeals to the modern worker. That includes not just\nparental leave and flextime but also caregiver leave, expanded fertility\nbenefits, gender reassignment and transformation assistance, financial\nwellness programs, and a slew of benefits that support critical life events,\nsays Kathie Patterson, chief human resources officer at Ally Financial\nServices in Detroit. \"Recruitment marketing exists now, but given the\ndemographics and importance of attracting talent, more organizations could add\nthose [benefits],\" she says.  \n\n##  6\\. Stay Abreast of Compliance Issues\n\n\u200bComplying with tax regulations, laws like the federal Family and Medical\nLeave Act, and Form I-9 and E-Verify requirements will continue to be at the\ncore of HR compliance. But as the workforce changes, HR will need to be agile\nenough to comply with laws related to the gig economy and remote workers, says\nemployment lawyer Michael Studenka, a partner in the Newport Beach, Calif.,\noffice of the law firm [Newmeyer &\nDillion](https://www.newmeyeranddillion.com/).\n\nAdditionally, changing state laws on marijuana use will force HR to deal with\npotential new policies (though federal law conflicts with the states that have\napproved recreational or medicinal marijuana use). There's also likely to be\ncontinued attention on pay equality, forcing HR to determine how to construct\na compensation strategy that allows the organization to attract star workers\nwhile not violating the law, Studenka says.  \n\n##  7\\. Be Certified (or Update Your Skill Set)\n\n\u200bAs certain HR functions become automated or outsourced (payroll, benefits and\nrecruiting, for example), human resource specialists need to expand their\nknowledge of both traditional tasks and overall business strategy. \"Education\nin our field is becoming increasingly more important,\" says Walter, Epic's\nchief talent officer. \"The field of HR is changing rapidly, with many new\nregulations impacting how we interview, how we pay, required training, how we\nprotect privacy, et cetera.\" HR professionals need to pursue education\nopportunities. She advocates taking courses in business finance to develop a\nmore authoritative voice in the executive suite.\n\nHR veterans also note that certification leads to higher pay and more\npromotions. A 2018 [PayScale survey ](https://www.payscale.com/data/hr-\ncertifications-pay)found that certification increased the odds of being\npromoted within five years by more than 21 percent for HR assistants and by\nnearly 25 percent for HR directors. And the higher the title, the more likely\nan individual is to have HR certification, the study found. Salaries, too,\ntend to be fatter for those with formal certification. In 2018, HR credential-\nholders made nearly 32 percent more than those without credentials, PayScale\nfound.\n\nAll signs indicate that HR will look very different by 2025. \"I can really\nenvision a day when HR is no longer HR,\" Goldstein says. Not only will HR\nleaders administer business decisions, they will help make those decisions\u2014as\ntrusted workforce advisors.\n\n _Susan Milligan is a freelance writer based in Washington, D.C._  \n\n _Illustration by James Fryer_\n\n[Leadership and Navigation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Leadership and\nNavigation)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=HR+2025%3a+7+Critical+Strategies+to+Prepare+for+the+Future+of+HR&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/hr-\ntoday/news/hr-magazine/1118/Pages/7-critical-strategies-to-prepare-for-the-\nfuture-of-hr.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

By\nRoss Falconer**\n\nHermes Airports began a Transformation Journey six years ago, with the vision\nto be an Employer of Choice. It is a journey that has required everyone\u2019s\ncommitment, contribution and participation, and which was recognised with the\nHR Excellence Award at this year\u2019s ACI EUROPE Best Airport Awards.\n\n![](http://www.airport-business.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/hermes-\nairports-award-winning-vision-to-be-an-employer-of-choice-1.jpg)\n\nAngela Gittens, Director General, ACI World, presented the HR Excellence Award\nto Natasa Iacovides, Senior HR Manager, Hermes Airports and Eleni Kaloyirou,\nCEO Hermes Airports.\n\n\u201cThe foundation was set in 2013 when \u2018People\u2019 became one of the six strategic\npriorities of Hermes Airports,\u201d explains Natasa Iacovides, Senior HR Manager,\nHermes Airports. \u201cIt was then that we set the goal to become an Employer of\nChoice, and our mission was to create a healthy organisation, with strong\nleadership and a high-performance culture, in which People would feel\nrecognised, respected, and given developmental opportunities that would\nimprove their personal and professional lives.\u201d\n\nThe journey began with a Culture Audit, where the overall purpose was to\ncapture the perceptions of the existing culture and involve Hermes Airports\u2019\nPeople in creating a new culture \u2013 one that would reflect its revised values,\nvision, and priorities. Based on the results, the People Action Plan was\ndeveloped, covering actions in all HR areas.\n\n\u201cSince then, we introduced well-established practices in Leadership, Learning\nand Development, Communication and Collaboration, Talent Management, Executive\nCoaching, Wellbeing, Recognition and Renumeration, etc,\u201d says Iacovides. \u201cThe\nintroduction of these initiatives has supported our desire to be a healthy,\ncaring organisation with strong leadership, outstanding results, and a\ncommitment to providing exceptional service to our customers.\u201d\n\nIndeed, employee Productivity increased by 55% and the Satisfaction and\nEngagement level by 30% (4.14/5 in 2018 compared to 3.18/5 in 2013).\n\n\u201cWinning the HR Excellence Award is a significant recognition of our\nTransformation Journey,\u201d Iacovides adds. \u201cAccreditations with the calibre of\nthe HR Excellence Award and the Platinum Investors in People standard signify\nthat Hermes Airports is an Employer of Choice in Cyprus and abroad. Our vision\nfor Hermes Airports to be a healthy organisation and an Employer of Choice is\na key priority for us; it increases the possibility to attract and maintain\nmore talents and skilled professionals, while at the same time enabling our\npeople to feel that they work for an organisation they are proud of.\u201d\n\n### **Establishing a shared airport culture**\n\nFor Hermes, learning is an ongoing developmental journey, and in 2017 the\nHermes Academy was designed with the aim to establish a learning culture that\nsupports constant development of technical knowledge and skills.\n\n\u201cNew joiners enter the Induction Program in order to effectively assume the\nresponsibilities of their role and become familiar with the corporate culture\nand core competencies,\u201d says Iacovides.\n\nAs People progress, they have the opportunity to develop their leadership and\nmanagement competencies, as they are defined within the \u2018Leadership and\nManagement Competency Framework\u2019.\n\nIacovides explains that Learning & Development has become a strength, scoring\n4.21/5 where in 2013 it was identified as a weakness (2.9/5).\n\n\u201cThe next step was to expand the Academy to the airport community as we aspire\nto establish a shared airport culture and collaborative mindset, where all\nstakeholders, acting as one, inspire our People to create an environment where\ncustomers can experience our high-level services and enjoy the warmth of the\nCypriot Philoxenia (hospitality).\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Hermes Airports established the Evexia | Being Well Program aiming to\nsupport its people and help them maintain a happy, healthy and productive\nlife. Initiatives are offered based on eight dimensions of wellness: physical,\nemotional, environmental, occupational, financial, spiritual, social and\nintellectual.\n\n\u201cThe initiatives include positive nutrition workshops, blood tests/health\nchecks, on-site occupational doctor visits and massage sessions, parental\ncoaching workshops including one-on-one sessions with a specialist, hiking and\nfootball clubs, the Employee Appreciation Week, and more,\u201d Iacovides comments.\n\nLooking ahead, Hermes Airports plans to introduce new and innovative HR\npractices to maintain the positive results and keep its People motivated,\nengaged and productive.\n\n\u201cWe will continue our leadership development journey, focusing on agility,\ncollective leadership and the creation of a self-transforming leadership\nculture, aiming to support our leaders steering the organisation through this\ncomplex and rapidly-changing environment,\u201d says Iacovides.\n\nShe adds that focus will also be given to the Hermes Academy for the airport\ncommunity. \u201cWe are confident that all of the above will be achieved through\nthe involvement and active contribution of our People and stakeholders.\u201d\n\n__\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\n### Leave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published.

total cost of workforce\n\nWhile in larger enterprises, workforce cost management is more kind of good-\nto-have, rather than a must-have, in case of smaller businesses, where capital\nis one of the many major hurdles, cost management becomes a matter of\nindispensability, rather than a matter of choice.\n\n![How to manage the ever-increasing total cost of\nworkforce](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1583470936/1583470935.jpg)\n\nCost of labour or the cost of human resources is one of the topmost\nexpenditure that a company incurs while running a business. The influx of\nmodern technologies into the HR function such as data automation, predictive\nanalytics and artificial intelligence (AI) have now added a certain level of\nsophistication in how businesses can manage and engage with their workforce\nfor higher productivity. However, this also has translated into more cost to\nthe company as now employers are recruiting staff who are well-versed in these\nemerging technologies. Such in-depth know how of advanced technologies and\nnew-age skill sets naturally enhances the individual\u2019s remuneration in the job\nmarket. Therefore, considering the aforementioned scenario, it is critical for\ntoday\u2019s businesses to not only manage this cost optimally, so as to ensure a\nhealthy ROI but also to ensure higher levels of employee productivity. While\nin larger enterprises, workforce cost management is more kind of good-to-have,\nrather than a must-have, in case of smaller businesses, where capital is one\nof the many major hurdles, cost management becomes a matter of\nindispensability, rather than a matter of choice.\n\nLet us look at some of the key ways on how to improve workforce cost and save\nfunds wherever possible:\n\n  * **Effective result-oriented productivity analysis of employees:** It is imperative to map the productivity of each and every employee working in the organization, against the cost or investments that are being incurred on those employees, from time to time. It must also be noted that productivity benchmarks and targets also shift depending on the nature of the industry and the scale of business in question. Some jobs already have basic benchmarks established while others follow stringent processes and modules. Performance measurement matrices today have become more scientific in nature, with the burgeoning use of various intelligent and intuitive online tools. It is also important to ensure that the employees are a right fit to the organization\u2019s culture and whose objectives are aligned to the overall vision of the organization. Each and every employee should be mapped on the basis of predefined benchmarks and aligned to the same, decisions on the next steps can be actioned. If productivity is not upto the mark specified, an organization may consider transferring the employee to another operational department or allocate him an option, wherein he or she can best demonstrate his/her capabilities. Similarly, if an employee is performing well, incentive should be awarded to encourage productivity and add to their motivation.\n  * **Manpower planning vis-\u00e0-vis revenue:** The cost of manpower as the ratio of revenue of an organization varies depending on the nature of the business. Meticulous planning and optimal allocation of resources are the absolute prerequisites to keep this at the lowest side. Manpower planning involves reviewing current manpower resources, forecasting future requirements and availability, and taking steps to ensure that the supply of people and skills meets the demand. In a nutshell, over-staffing or under-staffing can both be detrimental for an organization. Balancing out the ratio of labour and work volume, therefore, helps an organization to ensure profitability in the long run. Many business leaders are aware of this and have created systems to sustain this necessary balance. Some common methods that are in place include annual projection of vacancies, long-term estimates of vacancies, fixed minimum man specification requirements and specific position estimations. It also includes how much each team member contributes to the overall revenue (ROI) of that particular team vis-\u00e0-vis his individual pay scale.\n  * **Effective utilization of technology:** With the advancements in technology, database recording, digital health report recording, analytics, cloud processing and remote work solutions have changed the way workforce operates. Technological breakthroughs have done away with the limitations of geography and time, making today\u2019s workplace more flexible. Any employee can work from anywhere and coordinate/ collaborate with his team members in real time over calls, VCs and other online video and audio platforms and services. For example, with the help of video-conferencing, the R&D team which is centrally located can impart training to teams in regional offices smoothly. \n  * **Cross functional exposure:** Optimum utilization of resources through cross functional exposure is a good way to manage cost and help individuals grow, at their own pace and in their own time. For instance, considering today\u2019s integrated digital world, an employee in the marketing department could also easily be cross trained to handle social media platforms or PR functions of a brand. It is a great mutually beneficial concept, where employers can get more work done with fewer employees and employees can add another skillset to their professional portfolio. Win-win for all! Many organizations today also invest in training their workforce. Here, one-size-fits-all training is no longer adequate to meet the unique needs of learners. Employees expect customizable training across multiple platforms. Factoring in such costs is also therefore essential. Many organizations today organize boot camps, workshops, tailor-made training programs to cross train employees and hone their skills in other ancillary functions, apart from their core- competency areas. Internal audits are organized where the specific needs and requirements are identified. Post which, modules and faculties are conceptualized to organize such trainings. Employee exchange programs to domestic and foreign locales are also another way to ensure cross-functional exposure and holistic learning of workforce. In fact, learning and development, today, has become one of the key investment areas for corporates.\n\nOn a concluding note, managing workforce cost is not too difficult and can be\nachieved through keeping a track of finances. Managing finances astutely and\nimplementing practices such as cross-functional training through L&D programs,\nleveraging best-in-class technologies, effective manpower planning can go a\nlong way in

We\u2019ll start with a quick look at several macro\ntrends and then dive into the details of behind several vendors. (There\u2019s even\na book review to consider too!)\n\n## **Global pay**\n\nMost any business with more than a couple of employees is doing something\nacross global borders. The need for a single, global payroll engine has been\napparent for a long time although the available solutions have been, in a\nword, lacking. Severely lacking in my opinion.\n\nToday, many HR solution providers are either introducing their initial payroll\nproduct or earnestly trying to expand their payroll app to cover more than a\ncountry or two[. Kronos has rolled out a U.S. payroll\nproduct](https://www.kronos.com/products/payroll) and will expand into other\ncountries over time. Ceridian has grown beyond its U.S. and Canadian payroll\nfunctionality and earlier this year [announced support for the Australian\npayroll](https://www.ceridian.com/company/newsroom/2019/ceridian-australia-\nlaunch-of-dayforce-payroll) market. ADP, via its [global payroll functionality\nand its Celergo acquisition](https://www.adp.com/what-we-offer/products/adp-\nglobal-payroll.aspx), can support 140+ countries.\n\nOther firms are in play, too. [Blue Marble](https://bluemarblepayroll.com/) is\nrelatively new to the space but getting a lot of visibility with prospects and\nat HR shows. Blue Marble claims to support payroll in 135+ countries. [Papaya\nGlobal](https://papayaglobal.com/) moved into Payroll not long ago and\nsupports payroll in 100+ countries.\n\nPayroll providers are also going the other way. Companies like [Paylocity are\nadding HCM functionality](https://www.paylocity.com/) to their payroll\nsolutions.\n\nVendors that provide a basic global gross-to-net payroll function though are\nstill not delivering what customers really want. Software buyers want:\n\n  * Robust payroll to general ledger interfaces/integration\n  * Solid integration with cost accounting systems\n  * The ability to make error corrections anywhere in the process and ensure that other upstream and downstream systems receive the same adjustments automatically\n  * The ability to deliver payroll any day, any time, on-demand\n  * A single payroll entry system and a single payroll engine globally\n\nWe\u2019re still years away from this vision and businesses will still have to live\nwith a material amount of inefficiency during this timeframe.\n\n## **Workforce Management**\n\nWorkforce Management (WFM) is red hot right now. It seems every ERP and HRMS\nvendor either has developed their own WFM technology or is partnering with an\nexisting provider. SAP and Kronos have one such alliance.\n\nWFM is important for several reasons and verticals. Many positions require\nworkers have current certifications and are trained to do the tasks asked of\nthem. WFM tools track and ensure currency with such. You will see WFM getting\na lot of interest in health care, utility companies, railroads, regulated\nindustries and many service industries.\n\nWFM functionality can also include a robust scheduling tool to ensure that\nonly the right people get staffed on specific assignments.\n\nWFM functionality is targeted today for service organizations but it can do\nmore for manufacturers and others. This is why service management solutions\nare exploding in the hard industries as these firms add more service\ncapabilities (e.g., repair, warranty and workover activities) to existing\nofferings. Servitization is another driver of this phenomenon (e.g., turbine\ngenerator uptime as a service).\n\nHere\u2019s just one proof point on how hot this space is getting. [This week we\nsaw](https://www.prweb.com/releases/workforce_insight_acquires_presence_of_it_workforce_management_north_america/prweb16700619.htm):\n\n> [_Workforce Insight_](https://www.workforceinsight.com) _, a world leader in\n> workforce optimization, announced today that it reached a definitive\n> agreement to acquire Presence of IT Workforce Management North America, LLC,\n> a recognized leader in the Human Capital Management (HCM) and Workforce\n> Management (WFM) space across North America._\n\n## **Smart Analytics**\n\nSeems every HR vendor has a machine-learning enabled analytic application to\ndemonstrate these days. The future of reporting and analytics is clearly\nmoving this way. However, these solutions are still far from being mainstream,\ncommon and comprehensive.\n\nSmart analytic applications are mostly beta-products today. You\u2019ll see them at\nuser conferences and in sales pitches but they\u2019re not on the price list of\nmost vendors today as they\u2019re not ready for prime time yet.\n\nSmart software buyers should quiz any software sales team to provide them with\nresumes of people skilled in these tools and show you their availability to\nwork on your implementation. A tool that can\u2019t be implemented isn\u2019t worth\nanything.\n\n## Book Review - Flat, Fluid and Fast\n\nBrynne Kennedy founded [Topia](https://www.topia.com/), a talent mobility\nsolution, several years ago. She and her team created/pioneered a number of\nconcepts regarding talent mobility while launching and growing Topia. Now,\nBrynne\u2019s documented these learnings into her book, [**Flat, Fluid and\nFast**](https://www.amazon.com/Flat-Fluid-Fast-Revolution-\nEngagement/dp/1260457273).\n\nTalent Mobility is actually a big problem for many firms especially those that\nstill possess old-school ideas re: performance management, time-based career\ndevelopment, etc. The world (and workforce demographics/psychographics)\nchanged but many firms\u2019 attitudes regarding promotions, transfers,\nassignments, projects, etc. didn\u2019t. It\u2019s why some firms are struggling to find\nthe talent they need.\n\nThese firms struggle because they:\n\n  * Only promote people once they\u2019ve been in a position for a specified time regardless of whether the person may have been ready for new responsibilities months or years prior\n  * They don\u2019t look at the skills a person possesses and instead focus on time served in a given role\n  * Hire based on experience not skills or accomplishments\n  * Don\u2019t look at internal candidates to fill open roles \u2013 the bias is to keep existing employees right where they are and look to competitors to supply new people for the open positions\n\nThat old school thinking isn\u2019t working and a new generation of workers isn\u2019t\nsettling for it. I\u2019ve seen this first hand as younger workers value employers\nthat promote/hire based on demonstrated results not on time served.\n\nBrynne\u2019s book is structured well and it covers the gamut of talent mobility\nissues. The first part of the book looks at global mobility and the issues\nemployees face when firms don\u2019t know how to do it well. As someone who\u2019s done\na couple of ex-patriate moves in my career, these moves are often handled by\nHR people who have little to no first-hand knowledge of what the worker will\nencounter. I got through everything in one piece; however, colleagues at other\nfirms did not.\n\nOne colleague spent a year in the UK only to return to an organization that\nmade no provision for his return. Sadly, his is one of many similar stories\nI\u2019ve heard where the initial expatriate provisioning mostly worked but the re-\nentry was unplanned and botched. A company could be Flat, Fluid and Fast and\nstill be a Failure if it doesn\u2019t have a closed-loop process in place for\ntalent mobility.\n\nCHROs are facing a number of strategic challenges these days. They have to\nsupport outsized growth, fill many open positions, develop new sources for\nfuture skill needs and more.\n\nThese CHROs need a new approach to acquiring and utilizing talent if they hope\nto keep their own jobs. Brynne\u2019s book offers a number of pointers and is worth\nthe read.\n\n## Vendor Updates\n\n**Kronos** \\- I did a big piece on [Kronos in July this\nyear](https://diginomica.com/kronos-what-you-might-not-have-known). That\narticle described their offerings: Workforce Central, Dimensions and Ready. At\nthis week\u2019s KronosWorks, the company\u2019s biggest announcement was the\navailability of its new time clock technology.\n\n![Brian\nS](/sites/default/files/styles/article_images_full_desktop/public/images/2019-11/2019%2011%20Fall%20HR%20review%20pic%201.JPG?itok=StOpgFaU)\n\n_Photo by Brian Sommer \u2013 used with permission_\n\nThe new time clock, InTouch DX, is more like a consumer grade mobile phone or\ntablet in its look and feel. It does have a biometric scanner on the top and\nwill soon have a camera capability for facial recognition. The device has a\ncapacitive touch screen and supports a large number of features beyond simple\nclocking in/out (e.g., scheduling time off, reviewing absences, reviewing a\nteam\u2019s planned time off, etc.).\n\nThis device has two modes. It can operate in Community mode. This is useful\nfor badging in large numbers of people in a rapid fashion. Community mode is\ngreat for shift changes. It limits some user functionality to make fast entry\na reality. Individual mode is the other option. It provides the widest\npossible amount of functionality. A user need only swipe once and then can\naffect any number of actions.\n\nAre time clocks still relevant? No matter what you may think, Kronos sold a\nrecord number of time clock devices this last year and user interest in the\nnew devices was very strong (and positive). These devices still have a place\nin numerous verticals and in applications where physical security, cost\naccounting and/or time tracking are quite necessary. Will cell phones/tablets\nreplace these devices in time? Maybe, but not in the short-term.\n\nBeyond the new time clock, Kronos also announced record revenues of over $1.4\nbillion and strong EBITDA, too. Market uptake for the new all-cloud Workforce\nDimensions continues to grow. Over 600 customers have signed on with this\nproduct including a number of well-known, large firms.\n\nInternational growth is becoming an ever-important part of the overall growth\nstory behind Kronos.\n\n**Alight** \\- [Alight](https://alight.com/our-story) is one of the largest HR\nconsulting, implementation and outsourcing firms globally. I recently wrote\nabout their [acquisition of NGA HR](https://diginomica.com/alight-and-nga-hcm-\nacquisition-bold-ambitions). [In 2019, they also\nacquired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alight_Solutions) Hodges-Mace and\nCarlson Management Consulting (the latter is an implementer of Adaptive\nInsights \u2013 a budgeting/planning/consolidation toolset owned by Workday).\n\n[The firm recently announced](https://alight.com/our-story/newsroom/alight-\nsolutions-launches-artificial-intelligence) a smart virtual assistant, Eloise,\nthat \u201c _corrects, predicts and prevents costly payroll errors_ \u201d. Smart tools\nthat eliminate piles of non-value-added (or low-value-added) work in HR are a\ngreat use for new machine learning, workflow powered and exception-handling\ncapabilities. [OneSource Virtual](http://www.onesourcevirtual.com) is also\ninvesting in this kind of capability.\n\n**J\u00e4b\u00f4rd** \u2013 I did a call today with a new HR recruiting solution,\n[J\u00e4b\u00f4rd](https://www.jabord.com/home). For those employers (and jobseekers)\nseeking a newer alternative to LinkedIn, here\u2019s a potential new offering.\nJ\u00e4b\u00f4rd has tools to help employers enhance job postings, facilitate a better\n1-click application, a smarter ATS functionality, etc. For jobseekers, the\nsite permits faster applications, a better chance of matching to great jobs,\netc.\n\nJ\u00e4b\u00f4rd is brand new and a demo may be the best way to grasp all of the\ncapabilities that separate it from piles of old school solutions.\n\n**Vault** \u2013 I recently chatted with [Vault\nPlatform\u2019s](http://www.vaultplatform.com) Co-Founder and CEO Neta Meidav. This\nis a solution that helps firms avoid being implicated in a #MeToo issue. Vault\nPlatform permits workers to have a safe, secure way of reporting issues within\ntheir firm. The software documents incidents, timestamps all interactions and\nstores/saves evidence.\n\nVault\u2019s sales are being driven more and more by boards of directors not just\nfrom HR.\n\nOne aspect of the software that I liked was the software\u2019s ability to \u2018\n_connect the dots_ \u2019 when other employees are experiencing a similar issue or\ndifferent issues from the same perpetrator. If HR wants to get ahead of\npotential litigation or avoid the corporate and recruiting brand damage that\noccurs when rogue behavior becomes public, it might want to consider a more\nconsidered solution like Vault\u2019s.\n\n**Saba** \u2013 Saba has grown a lot in recent years. It did a deal to [acquire\nHalogen in May 2017](https://www.saba.com/press/news/saba-completes-\nacquisition-of-halogen-software) and then did another deal almost exactly a\nyear ago [when it acquired Lumesse](https://www.saba.com/press/news/saba-\nsoftware-completes-acquisition-of-lumesse). The Lumesse deal brings additional\nEuropean customers and sales pipeline to Saba. The combined firm now has over\n1,400 employees and over 4,000 customers globally.\n\nThe big product news involves their new people experience solution. This\nsolution (me:time), from my perspective, helps employees craft a better, more\npersonalized training program that aligns the person\u2019s immediate and long-term\ncareer needs with the needs of the firm. This solution delivers content\nexactly when needed, to the exact employee requesting it, in the format the\nemployee desires. The best aspect may be in how the training aligns with the\ndirection the employee wants to take their career. Instead of recommending\ntraining that aligns with what the employee already does, it can suggest\ncareer paths and the training needed to successfully traverse these.\n\n**AllyO** \u2013 [AllyO is the place to go](https://www.allyo.com/) to see a lot of\nbots in action in HR and Recruiting. That means there are lots of AI/ML-\npowered bots to better source, connect, engage, onboard, etc. candidates and\nemployees. Any software selection team needs to, at a minimum, see AllyO\u2019s\nsolutions as a way of understanding how HR must change and what opportunities\nexist to eliminate more low-value-added work and improve the recruiting and\nwork experience for jobseekers and employees.\n\n**Appcast** \u2013 [Appcast](https://appcast.io/) is what smart recruiters can use\nto better manage their spending re: job ads. If recruiters aren\u2019t careful,\nthey\u2019ll funnel too much spend to the wrong or low value job boards or\ndestination websites or overpay for the best sites.\n\n85% of the Appcast\u2019s shares were recently [sold to a German firm\nStepStone/Springer](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-\nrelease/2019/07/01/1876659/0/en/StepStone-acquires-majority-of-U-S-technology-\nprovider-Appcast.html) .\n\n**Visier** \u2013 Long-time HR analytics leader [Visier](http://www.visier.com) has\nbeen busy, too. I\u2019ve previously documented their OEM deal with [mid-market\nsolutions provider Insperity](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/visier-\npartners-with-insperity-to-bring-people-analytics-to-mid-market-\norganizations-300840560.html). They recently did [another deal with\nPaycor](https://www.hcmtechnologyreport.com/paycor-launches-visier-powered-\nanalytics-package/) where HR analytics are available to their mid-market\ncustomers, too.\n\nVisier\u2019s entry into the mid-market is notable as many analytic apps are too\ncomplex and require so much big data that makes them unusable for all but the\nlargest firms/employers. The new mid-market solutions are targeted for firms\nwith 500 or so employees and should work with mid-market HRMS products from\nfirms like BambooHR, Lever, Greenhouse and others.\n\n**Paylocity** \u2013 [Paylocity](https://www.paylocity.com/) is a payroll service\nprovider that went public in 2014. Their brand has been linked with payroll\nprocessing from the get-go. However, what too few people realize is that it\nhas a full HCM/HRMS suite, too. Now, the firm is getting the word out and\ntrying to change the perceptions people have about them.\n\nNot only has the company\u2019s product line grown, but it now has over 3200\nemployees and over 20,000 customers.\n\n**Kahuna Workforce** \u2013 [Kahuna\nWorkforce](https://kahunaworkforce.com/company/about-us/) is a competency\nmanagement solution that has a high degree of connection to workforce\nmanagement solutions. Like workforce management products, you find Kahuna in\nvertical industries like oil & gas, utilities, etc. The software allows you to\ndefine the competencies/certifications/etc. needed per role or position. Next,\nyou can assess where your team is along this dimension and identify what\ntraining or other steps are needed to get the team in optimal standing. People\ncan be assigned to specific projects based on their fit and compliance level.\nThe product is designed to work with many HRMS and ERP solutions.\n\n## My take\n\n2019 is showing some advancement in HR technology. In fact, I\u2019m more impressed\nwith the innovation in HR apps than the pittance of innovation in many ERP\nfirms (That\u2019s a subject for another piece). Payroll is still a big pain point\nwith many of my clients. But more firms would do well to start scanning the\ninnovations in HR if only to realize what could be leveraged by their firm\n(and what is still too immature). It\u2019s from realizing the potential of new\nsolutions that CHROs can begin to tackle some of their most strategic and/or\npainful workforce issues. It\u2019s time to move from the tired, mundane and costly\nHR products to ones that can redefine work, talent acquisition and retention.\n\n_Image credit - Brian Sommer_\n\nRead more on:\n\n  *

new consortium uses blockchain technology to store verifiable employee\nrecords.\n\nBy: [Carol Patton](https://hrexecutive.com/author/carol-patton/ \"Posts by\nCarol Patton\") | November 25, 2019

longer worry about the\nlength of time or paperwork required to verify a job applicant\u2019s learning\ncredentials. A new consortium is currently building a global clearinghouse or\ndatabase, called the Learning Credential Network (LCN), which supports\nblockchain technology to store permanent, verifiable records of job seekers\u2019\nskills and academic qualifications.\n\nThe [consortium](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2019/11/a-new-learning-\ncredential-blockchain-to-help-bridge-the-skills-gap/) was founded by five\norganizations: IBM; Central New Mexico Community College (CNM); an Australian\nUniversity that prefers to remain anonymous; the National Student\nClearinghouse, which provides educational reporting, data exchange,\nverification and research services; and VetBloom, which specializes in online\nveterinary courses and continuing education.\n\n\u201cBlockchain is a technology that solves issues around trust, transparency and\nprovenance,\u201d explains Alex Kaplan, global leader of AI and blockchain for\nlearning credentials at IBM. \u201cVerification is built into the technology,\neliminating the need to work with email or paper [forms]. No other\nverification is required.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nBesides mitigating the risk of fraud\u2014applicants using fake credentials\u2014the LCN\ncan help employers produce a list of potential workers with desired skills,\ncredentials or qualifications.\n\nAmong the key concepts behind the LCN is digital self-sovereignty, adds\nKaplan. Job candidates will own this information and have the power to decide\nwhat information they want to share with employers.\n\n\u201cEmployers can look across all skills, how they align with jobs of the future\nor projects they anticipate handling, and help employees better map their own\ncareer pathways by understanding what skills they need to develop to be\nsuccessful in their career,\u201d Kaplan says, adding that the LCN could also store\ninformation about employer courses or tests that employees completed or\npassed. As an example, he points to IBM\u2019s digital-badging program, which has\nissued more than 1.5 million badges to people for passing tests or finishing\ntechnology courses.\n\n**An Array of Benefits**\n\nAs the LCN becomes more widespread, [higher-education\ninstitutions](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/using-blockchain-new-\nmexico-community-college-becomes-first-community-college-to-issue-student-\nowned-digital-diplomas-300557931.html) can then step out of their long,\nestablished roles as middlemen between employers and students.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t really our core competency,\u201d says Tobe Phelps, chief technology\nofficer at CNM. \u201cWe\u2019re here to educate, not facilitate, relationships and be\nthe gatekeeper. We want to extricate ourselves from this [verification]\nprocess and allow students and employers to communicate more effectively in a\ntrusted fashion.\u201d\n\nPhelps says CNM wanted a quicker onramp for students into the world of work.\nOftentimes, he says, the verification process is slow and can delay or even\njeopardize a student\u2019s chances of being hired.\n\n**Related**[These are the skills recruiters of tomorrow will\nneed](https://hrexecutive.com/these-are-the-skills-recruiters-of-tomorrow-\nwill-need/)\n\nHe adds that federally mandated training, such as on safety or sexual\nharassment, can also be included in the LCN. So can courses employees complete\nafter earning their college degree to retool as their industry changes. He\nenvisions employers heavily using the LCN to verify post-college training.\n\nIt may not be long before the consortium reaches out to job sites like\nMonster.com or Glassdoor. Phelps says the LCN can validate information on\napplicants\u2019 resumes and then pre-populate online templates with their\neducation and training history.\n\nMeanwhile, Phelps is beta testing the LCN with his own employees who graduated\nfrom the school or completed CNM courses and is developing a free LCN phone\napp for students.\n\n\u201cBeing able to sift through an employee\u2019s or job candidate\u2019s information\neasily and map it against skill sets and degrees makes this a powerful tool,\u201d\nPhelps says, adding that the consortium is exploring subscription-based and\nother types of business models for the LCN.\n\n**Just the Facts**\n\nBy removing the grunt work involved with verifying applicant information, the\nLCN will enable recruiters to shift their focus to more important aspects of\nthe recruiting process. But there may be a tendency for some to rely too much\non these data and not take full advantage of opportunities to gather valuable\ninformation, such as during candidate interviews, says Scott Simpson, HR\nconsultant and chief technology officer at Cambria Consulting.\n\nTake several applicants competing for the same position. While the LCN\nverifies their degrees and employment history, it can\u2019t assess whether they\nwere self-starters, good at their jobs, strong communicators, effective\nproblem solvers or team players, Simpson says.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking for better ways to evaluate employee performance,\u201d says\nSimpson. \u201cRight now, we can\u2019t store reliable, subjective information.\nOrganizations would be reluctant to create public, permanent records that have\na lot of subjectivity to them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nIn the future, he says, artificial intelligence may provide subjective\ninformation on employee performance.\n\n**[Click HERE to read more coverage about AI in HR\ntechnology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/)**\n\nUntil then, he says, HR professionals can consider mining the LCN for fresh\ninsights into educational and employment trends.\n\nAlthough useful, Simpson adds, the LCN streamlines only a small portion of a\nrecruiter\u2019s job.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not anywhere near the whole of the recruiting process,\u201d Simpson says.\n\u201cBut, on the plus side, people can spend less time chasing down details and\nmore time looking at candidates\u2019 value-add and what they can bring.

How? Read on to know more:\n\n### The offbeat but \u2018cool\u2019 office culture\n\nIf there is one thing that makes startups stand apart from the big\ncorporations, is their ability to innovate, experiment, and maintain a quirky\nculture.\n\nTake this example of Zomato India\u2019s Trial Week. Trial week is a program where\nengineers are hired to work at Zomato for a week. The company takes care of\nthe travel expenses, and food is on the house, like for every other employee.\nThis is an excellent way for both the employee and Zomato to gauge the actual\nwork experience first hand, without committing.\n\nAnother company, Buffer has a concept called Open Salaries wherein the company\nprovides the information about how an employee's salary is calculated. The\ncompany has a formula to calculate salaries and these are shared with the\nwhole team. Open salaries are a step towards the ultimate goal of Buffer being\nan Open Company.\n\n### Startups: The millennials-attracting machine\n\nMillennials seek from their employers to value their contribution, which gives\nthem a sense that they are actually making a difference and not just following\na process. At the same time, they are a generation that wants work-life\nbalance and would much rather prefer a workplace that allows them to leverage\ntechnology for flexible and remote working than one that bogs them down with a\n9 to 5 routine.\n\n### Offering next-gen rewards and benefits\n\nFrom gift coupons to travel during holidays to paying for your internships,\nstartups offered the best and most luxurious perks and benefits that companies\nare offering this year.\n\nTake this instance of VMWare. The company recognizes employees who have been\nwith the company for four, six, eight, and 12 years. At each of these\nmilestones, employees get certain amount of money that they can give to any\ncharity of their choice. At the 12 year mark, they\u2019re given $12,000 for this\npurpose.\n\nStartups get a lot of advice. One of the most confusing pieces of advice is\nperhaps the question of when and how a company should add HR or People\nfunctions. The right time to adding HR function is still a conundrum for many\nstartups. However, one thing is sure that they compelled HR function to\nreinvent the overall wheel of employee experience.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Culture](/category/organizational-\nculture/culture?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=culture \"Browse more in:\nCulture\"),\n[#MyNextCurve](/tag/mynextcurve?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=mynextcurve\n\"Browse more in: MyNextCurve\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Anushree Sharma](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1500295266/authors/anushree-\nsharma.jpg)](/author/anushree-sharma)\n\n#### [Anushree Sharma](/author/anushree-sharma)\n\nAnushree is an Assistant Manager- Content at People Matters.

One of the main\nreasons is companies' traditional engagement-measuring tools\u2014employee surveys\nand feedback channels reviewed manually\u2014are inadequate for getting a full\npicture of how employees really feel.\n\nCue sentiment analysis technology powered by natural language processing and\nmachine learning. It interprets huge amounts of feedback to uncover\norganizational strengths and weaknesses and detect positive and negative\nfeelings toward a new policy, a change in benefits, management practices or\nworkplace culture.\n\nHR can then make decisions and changes, based on the feedback, to address\nemployees' concerns, which in turn encourages more open communication and\nhigher engagement.\n\n\"We know how to analyze traditional human capital data, but we've been missing\nthe other side, which is what I would call qualitative insights,\" said Armen\nBerjikly, senior director of growth strategy at Weston, Fla.-based Ultimate\nSoftware. He was the founder and CEO of Kanjoya, a leading software-as-a-\nservice company that developed natural language processing capabilities to\nmeasure and improve employee experience. Kanjoya was acquired by Ultimate\nSoftware in 2016 and rebranded as UltiPro Perception.\n\n\"There's far more going on behind what can be learned from traditional\nquantitative metrics, and it's usually going on in the realm of 'what are\npeople feeling?' and 'why are they feeling that way?' \" Berjikly noted. \"The\ngoal of sentiment analysis technology is to have a machine try to understand\nwhat someone feels and why they feel that way.\"\n\n _[SHRM members-only toolkit : _[_Managing Employee\nSurveys_](/resourcesandtools/tools-and-\nsamples/toolkits/pages/managingemployeesurveys.aspx) _]_\n\nSmarter Surveying\n\nLevel Access, a Vienna, Va.-based company helping organizations ensure that\ntechnology is accessible to people with disabilities, uses UltiPro Perception\nto learn about its 200 employees quickly, without the human bias that comes\nfrom manual review.\n\nBefore the company implemented the tool, employee surveys were inconsistent,\nmaking it difficult for Chief People Officer Colleen Wood to gauge sentiment\ntrends with any surety.\n\nThe company had conducted exit surveys for years but hadn't used standard\nquestions, she said. And general employee surveys were given at random times,\nwith different questions, so there was no way to truly compare how things were\nchanging.\n\nSince Level Access was already using Ultimate's HR information system,\nadopting UltiPro Perception was a natural fit. Easily integrating the survey\ntool with the company's employee demographics and organizational information\nmakes slicing and dicing the data that much easier, Wood said.\n\nShe fed 20 years of exit survey data into the tool, allowing her to study\nlong-term trends. She also can now capture feedback from employees with short,\nroutinely timed pulse surveys asking about relevant topics. \"If it's goal-\nsetting time, we might ask about goals,\" Wood said, \"or we will ask employees\nto rate a recent all-hands meeting.\"\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe discipline of sentiment analysis based on language has been around for a\nlong time, said Holger Mueller, vice president and principal analyst at\nConstellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm based in\nCupertino, Calif. But the application of digital data analytics technology to\nsentiment is more recent.\n\nLisa Abbott, vice president of marketing at Wootric, a feedback management\nsoftware company in San Francisco, said engagement surveys that solicit open-\nended feedback return voluminous amounts of sentiment. \"It quickly becomes\nimpossible to read, let alone act on, every piece of open-ended feedback,\" she\nsaid.\n\nIn addition, there's always the potential to introduce bias into an evaluation\nwith manual review.\n\nBefore implementing sentiment analysis technology, conclusions from a survey\nreview at Level Access essentially came down to Wood's \"gut feeling about what\nI was reading,\" she said.\n\nA sentiment analytics platform uses machine learning to recognize emotion in\nthe text, Abbott said. \"As themes are recognized, each employee comment from\nthe various surveys can be tagged with the relevant theme and sentiment\u2014for\nexample, positive, negative or neutral. The algorithms do the grunt work,\nreading the qualitative feedback and organizing comments into different\nbuckets with respective tags.\"\n\nWhile the technology helps HR managers understand general worker sentiment,\nBerjikly said Ultimate's tool also allows HR to view employees' emotions with\nmore granularity.\n\n\"Previously, both confusion and concern would have fallen under the negative\numbrella, but that doesn't help me improve employee engagement or job\nsatisfaction,\" he said. \"Even after drilling down and seeing that employees\nare sad or excited about something is not enough. You want to find out why\nthey feel that way in order to solve business problems. Sentiment analytics\ncan tie employees' confusion to their benefits, or their concern to pay\nequity.\"\n\nBut sentiment analysis will only be successful if enough employees submit\nenough text to be studied, Mueller said. \"Technology has made the inputs\neasier, but employees don't really want to write long sections in response to\nsurveys or performance reviews. People have survey fatigue. Sometimes the\nemployer forces it and gets garbage in return, which brings into question the\ndata and the validity of the analysis.\"\n\nBest Practices\n\nHere are some practical takeaways for HR professionals who are using sentiment\nanalysis technology:\n\n**Survey genuine issues.** \"Employees very quickly find out if only \u2026 routine\ntopics are being surveyed,\" Mueller said. \"It's important that survey\ndesigners are in contact with operational teams that know what the true\nchallenges, opportunities and hot topics are among employees.\"\n\n **Field short surveys less often.** Surveys should not take more than five to\nseven minutes to complete, Mueller said, adding that employees will be quickly\nturned off by a tool that requires too much of their time. \"Finding the right\nbalance between frequency and necessity is crucial for the success of any\nsurvey tool.\"\n\n **Show the connection.** Wood said employees at Level Access are thrilled to\nhave a way to share feedback and receive the results of that feedback. \"We\nclose the feedback loop by outlining 'here's what we asked, here's what you\nsaid, and here's what we are going to do about it.' If you share the results\nand what you will do to respond to employees' concerns, you are able to drive\ntrust and encourage future survey responses.\"\n\n **Commit to privacy.** Employee privacy is critical. \"Anything less is a dead\nend for a survey tool,\" Mueller said. \"Ensuring privacy and anonymity of the\nsurvey tool is crucial for the success of its implementation because the right\nbalance is the only way for employees to keep taking surveys and maintaining\ntrust.\"  \n\n  \n\n[Leadership and Navigation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Leadership and\nNavigation) [Change Management](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Change\nManagement) [Technology Metrics and\nAnalytics](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Technology Metrics and Analytics)\n[Consultation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Consultation)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Employee+Sentiment+Analysis+Shows+HR+All+the+Feels&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/technology/Pages/Employee-Sentiment-Analysis-Shows-HR-All-the-\nFeels.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

Click here to sign in.](https://login-\nsandbox.td.org/Company.aspx?ReturnUrl=referrer)\n\nShare\n\n**(Alexandria, VA), January 8, 2020** \u2014The Association for Talent\nDevelopment\u2019s latest research to measure the pulse of the profession\nculminated with today\u2019s release of the [Talent Development Capability\nModel](https://www.td.org/capability-model/access), a framework to guide TD\nprofessionals on the knowledge and skills they need to develop themselves,\nothers, and their organizations.\n\n\u201cThe new model underscores how specialized knowledge about how to create,\ndeliver, foster, and measure learning is essential to TD\u2019s ability to boost\nthe potential of our learners and deliver value to the organizations we\nserve,\u201d says Courtney Vital, associate vice president of education at ATD.\n\nn late 2018\u2014for the ninth time in 41 years\u2014ATD set out to define talent\ndevelopment (TD) today and to create concrete career paths for TD\nprofessionals with roles and levels into the next five years. More than 3,000\npractitioners from 73 countries (23 percent of respondents were from outside\nthe United States) evaluated the importance of 197 competencies for successful\njob performance now and in the future, and those results became the basis of\nthe model. The survey was the largest ever completed on behalf of competency\nmodel research.\n\nNoted in its accompanying book [_Capabilities for Talent\nDevelopment_](https://www.td.org/books/capabilities-for-talent-development),\nthe research confirms that talent development is no longer simply focused on\nthe tactical aspects of the design and delivery of learning. Instead, the TD\nfield has become a key element in the success and competitive advantage of\norganizations, making its practitioners essential partners with all areas of a\nbusiness in achieving organizational goals. Key business trends that inform\nhow talent development must approach its work include:\n\n\u2022 digital transformation and disruption  \n\u2022 innovation and adaptability  \n\u2022 contingent or gig workforce  \n\u2022 demographics of workers.\n\nThe latest research captured the major shifts in society and the larger\nbusiness landscape since the previous model was published. The major changes\nin the TD field were identified through a comprehensive literature review,\nexpert practitioner interviews, and advisory panel discussions. These trends\nspanned a variety of areas in business, technology, learning, science, and the\nprofession itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTalent development complements and supplements other organizational functions\nto prepare and enable the workforce to achieve the strategic aims of the\nbusiness,\u201d says Tony Bingham, president and CEO of ATD. \u201cTalent development\nclearly owns specific functions in their direct execution (such as training,\nperformance improvement, and career development), but it also influences the\nbroader talent management and HR ecosystem (such as talent acquisition,\nselection, succession planning, engagement, and performance management). It is\nthis combination of owning and influencing that establishes a strategic\nframework for talent development professionals to grow their own capabilities\nand increase the value they bring to their work.\u201d\n\nPreviously, ATD published competency models. This new model highlights\ncapabilities over competencies.  \n\u201cCompetence refers to having the knowledge and skills necessary to perform a\njob. It remains integral to performance and is one element of capability;\nhowever, capability is about adapting and flexing to meet future needs,\u201d\naccording to [_Capabilities for Talent\nDevelopment_](https://www.td.org/books/capabilities-for-talent-development).\n\u201cATD\u2019s focus has broadened to helping TD professionals build capability that\nwill not only help them be competent performing their work today, but also\nprepared for challenges they\u2019ll face in the future.\u201d\n\nThe new Capability Model is structured around three domains of practice, which\ninclude 23 capabilities:  \n\nAdvertisement\n\n  * that derive from interpersonal skills (Building Personal Capability) \n  * that come from building professional knowledge related to developing people and helping them learn (Developing Professional Capability)\n  * that affect an organization\u2019s ability to drive toward results and mission success (Impacting Organizational Capability). \n\n[_Capabilities for Talent Development_](https://www.td.org/books/capabilities-\nfor-talent-development) offers an in-depth look at the model and its\ncomponents, drawing from the research behind it. Inside are application tips\nfor individuals, educators, and organizations as well as examples and\ninterviews with thought leaders that describe an exciting future ahead for the\ntalent development field.  \nLearn more about ATD\u2019s new Talent Development Capability Model at\n[td.org/capability-model](https://www.td.org/capability-model).\n\n_Capabilities for Talent Development: Shaping the Future of the Profession_  \nISBN: 9781947308893 | 128 Pages | Paperback, PDF  \n[td.org/books/capabilities-for-talent-\ndevelopment](https://www.td.org/books/capabilities-for-talent-development)  \nTo order books from ATD Press, call 800.628.2783.\n\n  \n**_About ATD_**  \nThe Association for Talent Development (ATD) is the world\u2019s largest\nprofessional membership organization supporting those who develop the\nknowledge and skills of employees, improve performance, and help to achieve\nresults for the organizations they serve.

And he's not the only one.\n\n\"We have all seen situations where the decision to hire\u2014when two or more\ncandidates present the same level of hard skills' strength\u2014is made with soft\nskills as the differentiator,\" says recruiter Rebecca Bayne, the president of\nBayne Consulting & Search in Broomfield, Colo. \"It triggers the gut-level\ninstinct of the hiring manager and determines who will get the offer.\"\n\n\"And soft skills,\" Lammert adds, \"will also determine how well you perform in\nthe job, and how long you do it.\"\n\nOther recruiters are on the same wavelength as Lammert and Bayne on the\nimportance of soft skills. Although hard skills like specialized knowledge and\ntechnical expertise in an industry subsector are still essential, a successful\nleader needs a broad soft skill set to navigate different managing situations,\nrecruiters say.\n\nGiven the importance of soft skills, five industry recruiters were asked to\nshare which skills they believed to be most crucial in today's hiring market.\nIn these discussions, two broad soft skill sets\u2014communication ability and\nemotional intelligence\u2014came up time and again. Recruiters explained how these\nskills apply to specific managerial situations, and they discussed the soft\nskills of the future.\n\nCommunication\n\nFor many recruiters, communication ability reigns supreme when it comes to\nsoft skills.\n\n\"The most important soft skill is communication. It's the foundation of every\nother soft skill,\" says Jane Snipes, managing partner at NorthStar Recruiting\nin Florence, S.C.\n\n\"In my experience, communication skills are paramount to one's capability to\nexecute and deliver the day-to-day requirements of leadership and having\noversight for a team, small or large,\" Bayne says.\n\nIn Lammert's view, communication skills are an umbrella that covers several\nindividual talents that have many applications, both inside and outside the\nfirm.\n\n\"It's such an important skill set\u2014there's so much interaction internally [in a\ncompany],\" he says. \"It covers speaking, active listening skills, presentation\nskills and more.\"\n\nFor example, a manager's speaking and conversation skills will be a huge asset\nin working with vendors and external business partners outside the company, as\nwell as technical staffers, C-suite executives and the CEO.\n\n\"In this fast-paced business environment, the ability to communicate clear and\nconcise messages is crucially important,\" Lammert explains.\n\nAnother key asset under the communications umbrella is the ability to be an\neffective storyteller. For an aspiring manager, the value of this skill begins\nin the interview\u2014the ability to communicate and frame one's career progression\nas a purpose-driven narrative that is gaining momentum is \"critically\nimportant for a successful candidate,\" Lammert says.\n\nAfter the manager lands the job, storytelling continues to be an asset. \"It\nalso helps you become an influencer wherever you are in the organization,\" he\nadds.\n\nCommunication skills are also crucial for a manager in working with direct\nreports, recruiters say. Successful managers have a desire to coach,\nfacilitate and develop talent, and this takes continual\u2014and sometimes nuanced\nand sensitive\u2014communication.\n\n\"In general, those who achieve the greatest success in their careers have a\ngenuine interest in those around them and are skilled in communicating,\"\nSnipes says.\n\nFor years, employee surveys have found versions of \"I don't like working for\nmy boss\" as the most common reason for people leaving a job.\n\nAlthough there may be various reasons why a manager is disliked, a common one\nstems from the manager's failure to adequately communicate how valuable an\nemployee's contributions are. The employee winds up feeling undervalued and\nunappreciated, Snipes says.\n\n\"People don't leave companies, they leave managers, and the common factor\nlacking in those managers who chase away great talent is the ability to\ngenuinely appreciate the value an individual has to the company and to\nconsistently communicate that value,\" she explains.\n\nFor managers, the lesson here is not only that communication skills are vital,\nbut that they need to be consistently used. Sometimes, otherwise articulate\nmanagers will fail to communicate due to being too self-absorbed\u2014they are\noccupied with their own career advancement and impressing the organization's\nsenior leaders, rather than attentive to their direct reports. \"Many managers\nfocus on themselves instead of serving those they lead,\" Snipes says.\n\nFinally, there's another communication-related skill that's a key asset for\nmanagers\u2014the ability to establish a safe space for honest two-way\ncommunication, says Kevin Spagone, vice president of Reitman Personnel\nBranford, Conn.\n\nThis type of communication needs to be embedded in the company's culture, so\nthat employees feel comfortable in offering honest views without fear of\nreprisal or relationship damage, he explains. Not only will this help employee\nretention, it will also help the firm's reputation among potential employees,\nwhich will help recruitment efforts.\n\n\"Leaders who foster a culture where open, honest two-way feedback is the\nnorm,\" he explains, \"are savvy enough to realize that this gives them a\ncompetitive advantage in the marketplace.\"\n\nEmotional Intelligence\n\nBesides communication skills, emotional intel\u00adligence has become an important\nattribute for candidates in the current job market, says recruiter Stephanie\nCampbell of Security and Investigative Placement in Bethesda, Md. \"I am\nfinding more and more interest in that skill set,\" she says.\n\nEmotional intelligence (often abbreviated as EQ) is the ability to perceive\nanother's emotions, reactions and perspective, and to handle interpersonal\nrelationships judiciously and empathetically. In the world of management, it\nhas many applications, recruiters say.\n\nCampbell illustrates by relating a question she asks clients when trying to go\nbeyond the job description to get a strong handle on what type of candidate\nwould be a good fit.\n\n\"When we're working with a client, we will sometimes ask, 'What is it that's\nnot in the description that you are looking for?'\" she says. \"What's that\nextra bit, that's sort of between the lines?\"\n\nThe answer is often \"a lot of EQ skills.\" These include working well as a\nteammate, empathetic listening, building consensus and an ability to be\npersuasive and to motivate.\n\nProfessionals are rarely required to answer the question, \"Why are we doing\nthis?\" she says. Emotional intelligence is a huge asset for a manager who is\ntrying to explain this in such a way that will motivate teams to embrace\ninitiatives, she continues.\n\nEQ is also an asset in the interview itself, because it helps candidates\ndemonstrate their value, Snipes adds.\n\n\"The high EQ ones are fine-tuned to how they are perceived,\" she says.\n\"They're not just leaning on their laurels. They have actively done the\nresearch on the company, and so they can give examples of potential\ncontributions that are directly relevant\u2026. They are making really good\nimpressions.\"\n\nLammert is also convinced of the value of emotional intelligence, and says it\nbolsters a manager's communication skill set.\n\nFor example, managers with high EQ are aware of their audience; they know that\ndifferent employees have different learning styles and interests, and they can\ntailor messages and delivery to fit each employee.\n\n\"One case may call for more of a visual message, another case more of a\ntechnical type of message,\" he says.\n\nSkill Gaps\n\nWhile there is a near-uniform consensus on the importance of communication\nability and emotional intelligence, these skills are hard to find in some\ncandidates, recruiters say. Some observe that an overreliance on technology is\neroding person-to-person communication.\n\n\"Communication skills are becoming seriously lacking,\" Snipes says. \"We've\nbecome a society, a world, so focused on communicating electronically that the\nability to strike up a conversation in person with another human being is\nbecoming a lost art, particularly with the younger generations.\"\n\n\"The more the younger generations communicate electronically,\" she adds, \"the\nless practice they'll have communicating in person and the more often that\nlack of skill will be noticed.\"\n\nBayne voices a similar view. \"I believe that some of the technology we use on\na daily basis has changed our approach to communication and made some of us a\nbit lazy,\" she says. \"This has most clearly affected younger generations who\nhave learned to communicate more frequently with those tools, instead of using\ntraditional verbal or written communication.\"\n\nAnd Snipes sees another communication-related issue that is becoming more\ncommon with younger professionals. As the use of LinkedIn becomes ubiquitous\nin the business world, some younger candidates are using it as a social\nnetwork instead of a professional network.\n\n\"These users are using profile pictures from social situations, with nary a\nthought as to how the picture might be perceived by a prospective employer,\"\nSnipes says.\n\nHer advice is simple: keep professional photos professional. \"I suggest\navoiding the 4 Bs in profile pictures\u2014no beer, boats, baseball caps or other\npeople's body parts (that is, no one else's chin, arm, hair or shoulder).\"\n\nCommunication gaps are not the only deficiency, recruiters say. In the area of\nemotional intelligence, self-awareness can be a subtle yet important attribute\nfor a manager to have, but some lack it, Lammert says.\n\n\"It's that seeking of feedback, the willingness to admit mistakes and take\nresponsibility for actions,\" he says.\n\nOne possible reason is that, unlike other skills that can be linked to\nperformance metrics, \"self-awareness is not as easy to measure,\" and not as\nfrequently talked about, he adds. Still, it is a great quality to have, and\nself-aware managers often realize the importance of continuous growth.\n\n\"It can also drive a desire for development, and a desire to take on\nleadership roles,\" he explains.\n\nAnother subtle-yet-valuable soft skill that seems to be lacking in many\nmanagers these days is the ability to question assumptions, says Spagone. With\ntechnology and analytics developing at lightning speed, a successful manager\ncan't hold on to traditional ways of solving problems.\n\n\"There is a key subtle difference in the ability to identify a challenge\nwithout assuming that it can be solved the same way it was a year or two ago,\"\nSpagone explains.\n\nTake for example a manager who has found that one component of the firm's\nsecurity program has fallen out of compliance. That manager should not assume\nthat the traditional methods of addressing that problem are still valid.\n\n\"They must consistently question how decisions are reached, while still\nadhering to consistent standards, such as regulatory requirements,\" he says.\n\nSkill Sets\n\nBut while some managers may need to fill skill gaps, others pull together\nseveral soft skills to build a skill set that is especially effective in\ntoday's industry.\n\nFor example, Bayne cites the common industry reality that companies continue\nto try to do more with less, even though the pace of business continues to\nspeed up.\n\n\"Anyone in our industry who is good at what they do has more on their plate\nthan ever, and is busier than they have ever been before,\" she says. \"Because\nof that, the job needs to be done right the first time, for efficiency in\nproductivity and to maintain the highest level of customer retention.\"\n\nManagers who can survive, and even thrive, in this environment usually combine\ncommunication skills with the ability to work under pressure, a knack for\ntroubleshooting, and an insistence on maintaining integrity and a code of\nethics so no corners are cut, Bayne says.\n\nSpagone mentions another persistent reality in the industry\u2014the view held by\nsome company leaders that some departments are cost centers that distract\n(albeit a necessary one) from the overall business goals and financial targets\nof the firm.\n\nIn this environment, certain managers have the right combination of business\nunderstanding, executive presence and a focus on vision, goals and\ntransparency, and this skill set helps top executives think of their\ndepartments in a less limited way.\n\n\"It's about breaking the mold,\" Spagone says.\n\nBayne agrees, and adds that some of the soft skills in a desired skill set\nevolve over time. She offers the example of executive presence.\n\n\"The executive presence which now seems to garner the highest level of respect\nis very different than it was in previous decades,\" she explains. \"More than\never, leaders are expected to be transparent, approachable and in the trenches\nwith their teams, rather than delivering orders from above.\"\n\nFurthermore, Bayne cites another relevant trend in the industry: an\norganizational focus on developing a strong and distinctive culture. In that\nenvironment, managers who have combined the soft skills of coaching, team\nbuilding and teaching are often sought after.\n\n\"Coaching, team building and teaching often tie back to specific areas of\ncorporate culture, and because they are being demanded from the most recent\nadditions to the talent pool, they are in the spotlight more than ever,\" she\nexplains. \"They are now considered critical by both candidates and companies.\"\n\nFinally, Spagone says it is important to keep in mind that the combination of\nsoft skills needed will also depend on the circumstances surrounding the\nposition being filled.\n\n\"Companies and cultures are unique. And all new hires are about addressing an\norganizational challenge of some kind,\" he says.\n\n **Skills of the Future **\n\n\"We used to struggle with candidates that were heavily\ninstitutionalized\u2013leaders who had been successful inside of their own insular\ncorporate cultures, but who were unable to adapt in a different environment,\"\nSpagone explains. \"They were not agile enough to be effective in a new or\ndifferent organization.\"\n\nBut this is becoming less common, as businesses are more interconnected than\never. To compete, companies must be increasingly agile.\n\nTeam building will still be crucial, but in a more strategic and fluid way, so\nthat interdependent teams are staffed with members possessing portable skills.\nThey may trade members, interlock if necessary and work at an increasingly\nrapid pace, and managers must be able to make strategic decisions on the fly\nand nimbly rearrange all the pieces.\n\n\"Leaders must continue to understand where they need to add to their roster,\"\nSpagone says, \"and what skills can be groomed, what can be replaced or\noutsourced, or shared among their team\u2014and themselves.\"\n\n_Mark Tarallo is senior editor of_ Security Management _magazine_.\n\n_This article is adapted from _[Security Management\n_magazine_](https://sm.asisonline.org/) _ with permission from ASIS \u00a9 2019.\nAll rights reserved._\n\n[Communication](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Communication) [Management\nDevelopment](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Management Development)\n[Relationship Management](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Relationship\nManagement)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+Hard+Truth+About+Soft+Skills&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/organizational-and-employee-development/Pages/The-Hard-Truth-About-\nSoft-Skills.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

When it comes to management, we joke that _change is\nthe only constant_ yet we struggle as managers to deal with even the most\nbasic of changes. The rate of change is exponential and organizations that\nfail to adapt are swept away by the tides of competition and irrelevance.\nUnfortunately, when we consider the single most important position to drive\nchange, update processes, and ensure alignment between individual performance\nand corporate objectives, there are often few resources assigned to train,\nmentor, and guide new managers.\n\nMany new-manager development programs are based in the fundamentals,\nstructured upon the foundations of Fayol\u2019s five principles of planning,\norganizing, staffing, leading, and controlling. As essential primer points,\nthese are important\u2014but not enough to keep up with the challenge of managing\ntoday\u2019s workforce within the current global context.\n\nToday\u2019s leaders must also develop the following competencies to build a\nworkforce that is resilient and capable to achieve success in a globally\ncompetitive environment.\n\n**1\\. Purpose and Passion** \u2014Managers must find what drives them and inspire\nothers with their vision and confidence. Now more than ever, employees can\nsniff out a fake. Any manager who is simply \u201cgoing through the motions\u201d or\nlacks credibility, integrity, or honor will be eaten alive. On the other hand,\npeople will follow a leader with the right vision and passion.\n\n**2\\. Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving** \u2014Managers must learn how to\ncreate solutions to the problem, not just treat the symptom. We have become\ngood at putting a Band-Aid on things and sending the problem down the line.\nManagers who stop, fix it, and solve the problem will make the biggest\ndifference.\n\n**3\\. Communication** \u2014Interpersonal, written and verbal communications are\nessential to success. In a world of texting\u2014full of noise but void of human\nconnection\u2014the manager who can actually connect to his or her people will gain\ntrust, loyalty, and performance every time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n**4\\. Growing Others** \u2014A manager\u2019s success is tied to how well they can help\nothers succeed. After all, an organization is only as good as the people\nworking for it. The sooner managers understand that they are only as good as\nthe people they work with, the sooner they will figure out their primary role\nto grow, develop and improve those with whom they work.\n\n**5\\. Building Partnerships** \u2014Identifying key stakeholders and partnering to\nachieve more is the synergistic model to do more, achieve more and become\nmore. It\u2019s that simple. We can do more together than alone and the sooner a\nmanager can understand that, the sooner they will become successful.\n\n**6\\. Accountability** \u2014This simply means holding ourselves and others to the\ngoals and standards we set to achieve. Employees want to know when they are\ndoing a good job\u2014and they also want to know when they are not, but in a\ncandid, respectful manner. They want to be successful, but they can\u2019t fix what\nthey don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a manager\u2019s job to help them succeed and to hold them\naccountable when they are not engaging in success-oriented behavior.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n**7\\. Alignment** \u2014Managers must create a path to success where people,\npractices, and leadership align. From there, the manager\u2019s primary job is to\ncoach and guide others to stay on the path and move forward to achieve\nsuccess.\n\nSmart organizations don\u2019t wait for managers to be promoted before beginning\nthe competency development journey. By recognizing the value of these\ncompetencies, organizations can identify how they are applied in different\npositions and settings to optimize outcomes. Once their applications are\ndefined and measured, these concepts can be built into development\nopportunities, training, coaching, and other learning that can begin even\nprior to their assignment as a manager. This allows for gradual and ongoing\ndevelopment of key talent to prepare for management opportunities. These\ncompetencies can then be built into the core content as organizations engage\nin management development once in their new positions.\n\nTimes will continue to change. The workforce and global competitive dynamics\nwill always remain dynamic. By developing these essential competencies within\nyour new and existing managers, they will be empowered with the tools of\nresilience and flexibility to meet the ongoing challenges that will come their\nway.  \n\n[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.astd.org/Publications%20Marketing/Books/2018/Leadership%20Lessons%20for%20Any%20Occasion/Betof%20Leadership%20Lessons%20for%20Any%20Occasion-\nPromo-Card-desktop.png)](https://content.td.org/r/38606)\n[![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.astd.org/Publications%20Marketing/Books/2018/Leadership%20Lessons%20for%20Any%20Occasion/Betof%20Leadership%20Lessons%20for%20Any%20Occasion-\nPromo-Card-mobile_2.png)](https://content.td.org/r/38606)\n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [Accountability](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Accountability)\n  * [Collaboration](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Collaboration)\n  * [Communication](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Communication)\n  * [Engagement](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Engagement)\n  * [Executive Development](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Executive%20Development)\n  * [Leadership Development](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Leadership%20Development)\n  * [Listening & Assessing](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Listening%20%26%20Assessing)\n  * [Management Development](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Management%20Development)\n\n[ ](https://www.td.org/user/about/WadeLarson)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[Wade Larson](https://www.td.org/user/about/WadeLarson)\n\nDr. Wade Larson is an author, speaker, coach, consultant, and CHRO for\nWagstaff Inc., a global manufacturing firm in Washington State, and has worked\nmore than 25 years in the field of human resources and professional\ndevelopment.

If the leader chooses to consider\nadvancement in line management as part of their development planning, he/she\nmay have to overcome some or all typical perceptions of HR in their\ninteractions with line management people.\n\n# HR Leader Development\n\n## **Typical Line Management Perceptions of HR**\n\nUnfortunately, it is fair to say that when a line executive position becomes\navailable within most companies, few HR leaders are given serious\nconsideration among the internal candidates for it.  This is primarily due to\ntheir lack of relevant work experience in line management.  However, it is\nalso due to several perceptions that line managers and executives have\nregarding HR leaders, for whom they have little respect as a business peer.\nTherefore, if an HR leader wants to be seriously considered for any line\nmanagement opening, he or she must fully understand and respond to these\nperceptions in all their interactions of line management.  \n\n> DOWNLOAD:  [The Future of Work: Strategy, Culture and HR's\n> Role](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-tech/whitepapers/the-future-of-\n> work-strategy-culture-and-hrs-role)\n\nHere are some of the important perceptions.\n\n  1. HR leaders are viewed as an HR person FIRST and as a business person a distant SECOND.\n  2. HR leaders have little or no pragmatic understanding of the strategic, financial or operating aspects of the company's business.\n  3. HR leaders have little or no understanding of the company's strategic, financial or operating business objectives for the current fiscal year.\n  4. Due to their lack of these understandings, they are considered as theoretical or conceptual thinkers, rather than pragmatic business thinkers and doers.\n  5. Many line managers and executives view HR primarily as an administrative function that operates by itself, far away from the significant challenges and risks of the business itself. Line management's compensation and reputation is directly dependent upon their ability to achieve difficult business results in this uncertain and volatile business environment.  Conversely, HR management's compensation and reputation is primarily risk adverse while being dependent upon its administrative excellence that is unencumbered by the hectic and risky operating side of the business - in stark contrast to all other functions that deal with it daily.\n  6. HR leaders are overly concerned with their administrative duties, almost to the exclusion of trying to help the CEO and line management executives to achieve the company's strategic, financial and operating business objectives for the current fiscal year and beyond. In fact, most line executives would be elated if HR would provide some innovative and pragmatic HR program or training and facilitative service to help them achieve these business objectives.\n  7. HR's leadership development programs, especially those for senior and upper management, deal almost exclusively with soft leadership skill development, rather including the hard skills that line executives value much more in a **75% hard/25% soft skills mix**. Line executives would much prefer that the APPROPRIATE MIX of hard and soft skills be TAUGHT TOGETHER while applying them to the executive's real world business objectives, plans, challenges and risks, because **that is the way they exist in their real business world**.  Historically, HR leaders have tended to cover only the soft skills because they are unfamiliar and/or uncomfortable with the hard skills.\n  8. Here are some examples of **hard skills** for senior and upper management.\n\n  1. _Functional Acumen_ - understanding various business functions (sales, marketing, product development, manufacturing, etc.) and sub functions (for manufacturing, they are production, quality control, manufacturing engineering, inventory control, etc.), along with planning, controlling and leading major multi-functional and/or multi-divisional team efforts to achieve critical business results.\n  2. _Financial Acumen_ - understanding the company and division Income and Cash Flow Statements and Balance Sheet, sales volume and gross profit margins for major products, budget/profit planning and performance.\n  3. _Fiscal Year Business Objectives_ \\- for the company, divisions and key executives.\n  4. _Business Strategy_ - understanding the company and divisional strategic plans, major product/market development plans, financial plans and contingency plans.\n  5. _Executive Skills_ - Board and top management interaction on key business issues, stock market analysis and analyst interaction, championing innovation and continuous improvement, consistently achieving a profitable financial results and strategic growth, creating an effective work place culture, leadership, and so on.\n\n  \n---  \n  \n  9. HR leaders seem to spend a disproportionate amount of their time and resources on the problems of lower and middle management where the problems are relatively simple and the solutions are relatively easy, at the expense of those faced by senior and upper management where the problems are much more complex and the solutions are complicated and far from easy to implement.\n\n> SEE ALSO:  [Feedback that's Wanted](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-\n> talent-management/articles/feedback-thats-wanted)\n\n## Inherent Decision-Making Factors\n\nThere are certain inherent factors that relate to any selection of a person to\nfill a top HR or line management position at the senior or upper management\nlevel.  Some of the key ones are listed below.\n\n  1. First and foremost is the following HARD TRUTH: As long as investors and the market hold the Boards and top management of any private or public company accountable for achieving certain strategic, financial and operating business objectives over the short and long term, any viable candidate for a senior or upper line management position must first have the necessary hard skills that meet the requirements of the position.   Without those hard skills, job success will be very difficult to achieve.\n  2. Such decisions are usually made by the CEO, line management executives and, in the case of important top management positions such as the CHRO, by a member of the Board of Directors; almost all of whom typically have a line and/or financial management background.\n  3. All of the decision-makers noted above probably have had little experience in their own business careers working with a business-oriented HR executive in a significant and meaningful strategic or operational way. Therefore, the HR candidate must make it **explicitly clear** in an interview exactly how HR can help the CEO to achieve the company's business objectives and strategies.\n  4. HR success in any company is inexorably tied to the respect that the CEO and line executives have for the HR leader **as a business person.** In their eyes, such respect cannot simply be handed over to the person because of their job title. **  **Rather, the HR leader must be able to think and act as a business person at all times in an effort to earn that respect.\n  5. As a general rule, the CEO and line executives will be looking for the HR leader to \"chart their own path\" to the function's legitimacy as an equal business partner by **directly** connecting some of their HR programs, and training and facilitation services to the achievement of several company business objectives.\n\nTo facilitate upward career growth in either HR or line management, the HR\nleader should consider various guidelines in their development planning in\norder to achieve a successful outcome.  Such guidelines are outlined below for\na HR or line management path, a line management only path and an HR management\nonly path.\n\n## HR or Line Management Path\n\n  1. The earlier in your career that you start your development planning for either or both paths, the more likely you are to be successful.\n  2. Each year, the HR leader should have a personalized development plan that takes into account the leader's next job aspirations and management's assessment of them.\n  3. For senior and upper management development, utilize a 75% hard/25% soft skills mix because the vast majority of CEOs and line executives view and value them as such. Soft skills would include interpersonal skills, management skills and leadership styles, among others.\n  4. There should be a thorough and fair assessment of the HR leader's current hard and soft skills that are required for the next most likely management position in the career path.\n  5. Assuming the HR leader's current performance is above satisfactory, the plan should concentrate on providing the necessary hard skills set for the next most likely position while getting the approval of the appropriate management executives. These skills should be selected within the practical context of the position's current and upcoming fiscal year business objectives and plans.\n  6. The plan should include the development of the HR leader's **business acumen** in relation to the company and/or division's business plans and objectives for the fiscal year.\n\na. Financial\n\n  *     * Net Sales or Revenue\n    * Operating Profit - both dollar and per cent of net sales or revenue\n    * Net income - both dollar and per cent of net sales or revenue\n    * Net earnings (income) per share\n    * Cash Flow - dollar amount\n    * Major capital expenditures\n\nb. Sales/Revenue\n\n  *     * Top ten customers by dollar sales volume\n    * Top ten products by dollar sales volume and gross profit margin percentage\n    * Major sales contracts up for renewal\n    * Customer Service improvement metric(s)\n\nc. R&D and Product Development\n\n  *     * Major product engineering projects to be launched in the next few years\n    * Current year new product introduction and launch with the expected sales volume increase\n    * Current year existing product enhancements with the expected sales volume increase\n    * Expected major quality, reliability and performance specificiation improvements\n\nd. Manufacturing\n\n  *     * Quality improvement metric(s)\n    * Production efficiency improvement metric(s)\n    * Production scheduling improvement metric(s)\n    * Specific cost control improvement metric(s)\n    * Purchasing improvement metric(s)\n    * Inventory Control improvement metric(s)\n\ne. Strategic Planning\n\n  *     * Anticipated acquisitions and their expected financial and market impact\n    * Expected new product and/or market introductions\n    * Expected amounts of net income and earnings per share improvement\n\nThis data gives the HR leader the necessary awareness of the company's\ncritical strategic, financial, and operating business objectives and plans\nwhich, in turn, gives him/her the ability to interact with the CEO and line\nexecutives on these critical business matters, rather than only being able to\ninteract with them on HR matters.\n\n  7. Recognize that 70% of the meaningful and pragmatic learning and development for any management position will occur from actually performing its duties and responsibilities, 20% from team-related projects and 10% from seminars.\n  8. Generally, seminars should only be used to provide some general background and information about a function or management position that the HR leader has had little or no background.\n  9. Each function within a business (Sales, IS, Operations, Product Development, Finance, etc.) has four or five major sub-functions. Within each sub-function, there are several important departments that have management positions which, in turn, have four or five major responsibilities.  The HR leader should start to interact with the current managers in these positions to understand and document this information, and how it relates to the company's ability to achieve its business objectives and strategy.\n  10. The HR leader's developmental progress versus the plan items should be reviewed at least every six months, and preferably every three months.\n  11. It is important to achieve significant quantitative and qualitative business results in every one of the management positions you assume in order to reinforce to upper management your upward management potential. Achieving these results typically takes at least two years.\n  12. Whichever path is pursued, establish a network of insider and outside experts in all of the appropriate sub-functions and/or departments to assist in the development.\n  13. The HR leader's developmental plan progress versus the plan items should be reviewed at least every six months, and preferably every three months.\n\n## Line Management Only Path\n\n  1. Understand and appreciate the vast number of complexities and difficulties that the CEO and line executives must navigate within every fiscal year so that all functional aspects of the business are intertwined and coordinated successfully to beat the company's competitors, achieve its financial goals and increase shareholder value.\n  2. When establishing a development plan for an upcoming line management position, give primary emphasis to the necessary hard skills that are required for job success.\n  3. Advise upper HR management in advance that you are exploring this line management career option as a **possible** career path. Even if the HR leader subsequently returns to HR after assuming a line management position, such experience will be invaluable to both HR and the company in the future. \n  4. Seek out an **influential** line executive, preferably within the particular function in which you will assume your initial management position, who knows you well and can act as your mentor. Once selected, advise HR management accordingly.\n  5. If the ultimate career goal is running a business as a general management executive, you should uncover a sequential progression of management positions in the various key functions of the business (Product Development, IS, Sales, Finance, etc.) If the ultimate career goal is to become a functional executive (V-P Sales, V-P Marketing, etc.), uncover a sequential progression of management positions in the various sub-functions involved (for Manufacturing, they would be Manufacturing Engineering, Production, Inventory Control, Purchasing, Quality Assurance, etc.).\n  6. In each sub function there is three or four key departments that have salaried management positions which are valued more than others. Each of these positions typically has three or four important areas of responsibility in which actual work experience is more desirable than others for advancement purposes.  If possible, you should strive to assume a management position within one of these important sub-functions.\n  7. However, seek out your **initial** line management position within a particular function where you have had the most practical work experience interacting with their managers and different managerial positions. Review the job description and understand the position's major areas of responsibility and the business objectives for current fiscal year.\n  8. Before assuming any line management position, make a concerted attempt to participate in and/or lead a major team project that deals directly with the particular line department or take an appropriate seminar in an effort to acquire some practical department knowledge.\n  9. With the advice of the mentor and the new boss, review the key areas of responsibility for your management position and each position under your control beforehand. Learn about the major projects and tasks currently underway, the progress made to date and any potential roadblocks to success.  Finally, understand how the areas of responsibility and projects relate to the department's business objectives.\n  10. Start interacting with appropriate line management executives within the function regarding the department's various business issues and how they relate to the function's ability to meet its business objectives.\n  11. Recognizing the desired 75% hard/25% soft skill mix for any line management position, seek out and verify the position's required hard skills for your future development.\n\n## HR Management Only Path\n\n**All of the following guidelines assume that the HR leader desires to support\nor elevate the respect for the HR function as an equal business partner to\nline executives, as they work together to help the CEO achieve the company 's\nstrategic, financial and operating business objectives.**\n\n  1. HR leaders will typically have an ultimate career goal of being a Chief HR Officer (CHRO) or the head of a HR sub function, such as V-P Compensation & Benefits. The development plan for one is very different than the one for the other.\n  2. If you desire to pursue the CHRO path, it is critical to assume important salaried management positions within the following critical sub functions: Compensation (including executive compensation), Talent Management, HRIS, Management Training & Development and, if appropriate, Labor Relations. If you desire to pursue the path as a sub-functional HR executive, you should acquire actual job experience in the appropriate major departments within the sub-function.  For example, under the Compensation sub function, the departments would be Salary Administration, Executive Compensation, Benefits Planning and Benefits Administration, while emphasizing the understanding of various HR-related laws and legal requirements.\n  3. Whichever path is pursued, establish a network of inside and outside experts in all the appropriate HR sub-functions and/or departments to assist in your development.\n  4. It is important for the HR leader to establish and maintain a personalized data base of important outside research papers, survey results, functional reports, major internal proposals, seminar notes, and other relevant information for each sub function to help facilitate movement into any new salaried management position in the career path.\n  5. Before the start of every fiscal year, fully understand the company's and/or division's strategic, financial and operating business objectives so that you can interact with other company executives regarding them. For each business objective, seek out a new and innovative HR program or management training and facilitation service that can help the CEO and line executives to achieve them.  Such HR efforts will clearly demonstrate HR's **business value** to the company. \n  6. To accomplish 5 above, the training/facilitation services provided by the Management Training and Development department will have to shift its program emphasis **AWAY FROM** providing development on only interpersonal skills, simple leadership styles and basic management skills, and **MOVE TOWARD** offering a **BALANCED PORTFOLIO** of soft skills development and business-related skills development.\n  7. To accomplish 6 above, seek out HR programs and training/facilitation services such as those outlined in the following examples.\n\n**_Financial Objectives_**\n\n.  _To improve earnings per share from \"X\" to \"Y\" dollars/share_.\n\no With Finance, implement a Cost Control/Profit Improvement workshop to\nidentify and quantify potential cost savings and profit improvement\nopportunities.\n\no With Engineering and Marketing, implement a Product Improvement workshop to\nidentify product/service innovations that can gain market share +/or reduce\nproduct cost.\n\n.  _To increase cash flow by \"Z\" dollars_.\n\no Train Sales staff how to resolve and collect outstanding receivables to\nbring in more cash.\n\no With Manufacturing, implement an Inventory Reduction workshop to identify\nand quantify items that can be eliminated, reduced or replaced by less\nexpensive ones.\n\n**_Strategic Objectives_**\n\n.  _To develop 20 general managers who can operate a $50M/year business._\n\no With outside experts, develop a seminar workshop that covers strategic\nplanning, financial management, product/market  development, sales and\nleadership.\n\no Set up a personalized development plan for each general manager.\n\no Review the entire compensation package for each general manager annually.\n\n.  _To increase sales 20% by acquiring a business that uses an important new\ntechnology._\n\no Update the Sales Incentive plan to recognize the new technology and improved\nprofit.\n\no With Sales, evaluate the competency level of Sales staff in the new\ntechnology.\n\no Evaluate the current recruiting sources in the new technology and identify\nnew ones.\n\n**_Operating Objectives_**\n\n.  _To reduce time-to-market for product \"A\" by 30% to exceed industry\nstandards_.\n\no With Engineering and Marketing, implement several team efforts to reengineer\nand streamline the entire design and launch cycle.  Retrain management on key\nchanges.\n\no Conduct a Project Management workshop to ensure that this project, and all\nsubsequent product development projects, are achieved on time.\n\n.  _To improve customer care to exceed industry standards_.\n\no With Customer Care, survey outside and company experts to catalog new key\nservice principles, standards, measures and reporting requirements.\n\no Determine the new key skills areas required for success and assess the\ncompetency level of these skills on current staff.\n\no Hire new personnel and retrain all staff on new principles, processes and\nmeasures.\n\no Review findings with top management and acquire implementation approval.\n\n  8. When HR is considering a new or improved HR software package, ensure that the first priority is given to which software package will best **directly** support the company's business objectives. Once that is satisfied, the second priority should be which software package will best improve the effectiveness and efficiency of HR performing its administrative duties.\n  9. In all interactions with the CEO and line executives, think and act like a business person FIRST and an HR person SECOND.\n\n## **Summary**\n\nThe above guidelines are primarily designed to facilitate the career growth of\nany HR leader who has the potential to work in senior or upper management,\nwhile supporting or elevating the respect for the HR function within the\ncompany.\n\n_Picture

These\nchallenges can become threats to the culture and identity of the nation. All\nof this requires vigilance and an updated education system, which includes\nstrengthening the role of teachers,\u201d he added.\n\nHundreds of teachers attended the annual celebration at ICC, where 27 teachers\nwere recognised for their contribution to education.\n\nReceiving the Meritorious Teachers Award were retired educators Pg Datin\nPaduka Hjh Mariam Pg Hj Matarsat; Dato Paduka Hj Ishaaq Hj Abdullah and Hjh\nHalimah Mohd Ya'akub.\n\nMeanwhile, recipients of the Excellent Teachers Award were Dr Lim Lee Hoon, a\nchemical science lecturer from UBD; Zulkipli Hamid who teaches machining at\nthe IBTE Sultan Bolkiah campus in Seria; Rossaleni Hj Selamat, a Malay\nlanguage teacher from Masin Secondary School; and Lim Kian Boon, who teaches\nmanagement at the Institute of Brunei Technical Education.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * [Tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n  *   * [WhatsApp](https://thescoop.co/2019/09/23/moe-upgrades-hr-department-to-raise-teacher-performance/?share=jetpack-whatsapp \"Click to share on WhatsApp\")\n  * [Email](https://thescoop.co/2019/09/23/moe-upgrades-hr-department-to-raise-teacher-performance/?share=email \"Click to email this to a friend\")\n  * More\n  * \n\n  *   * \n\nTags:\n\n  * [Education](https://thescoop.co/tag/education/)\n  * [Sultan of Brunei](https://thescoop.co/tag/sultan-of-brunei/)\n  * [teachers day](https://thescoop.co/tag/teachers-day/)\n\n## Trending Stories\n\n  * [COVID-19 live updates: No new cases for third day in a row](https://thescoop.co/2020/04/04/covid-19-live-updates-2/)\n  * [Elderly man charged with bludgeoning puppies to death](https://thescoop.co/2020/04/07/elderly-man-charged-with-bludgeoning-7-puppies-to-death/)\n  * [COVID-19 live updates: March archive](https://thescoop.co/2020/03/13/covid-19-live-updates/)\n  * [Sapura Energy vows to expand business in Brunei](https://thescoop.co/2019/08/27/sapura-energy-vows-to-expand-business-in-brunei/)\n  * [Health minister pays tribute to nurses, midwives](https://thescoop.co/2020/04/07/health-minister-pays-tribute-to-nurses-midwives/)\n\n#### Videos\n\n### Temburong bridge opens to the public\n\n[](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCcrD4bNN6k&rel=0 \"Temburong bridge opens to the\npublic\")\n\n### Brunei's 36th National Day\n\n[](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_i92H6jdTk&rel=0 \"Brunei's 36th National Day\")\n\n### K-pop fans in Brunei plant forest for BTS\n\n[](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXfyi_3Tqy4&rel=0 \"K-pop fans in Brunei plant\nforest for BTS\")\n\n[Follow us on\nYouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5-xUW7jW1IeMUFaDnTNAaw \"Follow us\non YouTube\")\n\n[![The Scoop](https://thescoop.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/The-Naked-Scoop-\nWhite-300x101.png)](https://thescoop.co/)\n\n  * [About us](https://thescoop.co/about/)\n  * [Contact](https://thescoop.co/contact/)\n  * [Advertise with us](https://thescoop.co/advertise-with-us/)\n\n#### Follow Us\n\n  * [ Facebook ](https://facebook.com/thescoop.co)\n  * [ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/thescoop_co)\n  * [ YouTube ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5-xUW7jW1IeMUFaDnTNAaw)\n  * [ Instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/thescoop.co)\n\nCOPYRIGHT [wpsos_year] SCOOP MEDIA\n\n__\n\nSend to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address\n![loading](https://thescoop.co/wp-\ncontent/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif) Cancel\n\nPost was not sent -

You need to start hiring talent with\nsustainability credentials\n\nrcnt.eu/6ud3j\n\nBy [Jon Axworthy](https://www.raconteur.net/contributors/jon-axworthy)\n\nMarch 6, 2020\n\n![Sustainability and talent management](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/SB_P4_1.jpg)\n\nCommunication, emotional intelligence and problem-solving are just some of the\nattributes companies currently prize when looking for talent. However, it\u2019s\nrecently emerged that sustainability recruitment is being overlooked in the\ninterview room, which could come at a real cost for any company not making it\na procurement priority.\n\nThe disconnect has been highlighted by research released earlier this year by\nexecutive recruitment specialists Russell Reynolds, which revealed that out of\n1,500 appointments in 2019, only 2 per cent of role profiles specified a need\nfor sustainability credentials as a candidate requirement.\n\n\u201cConversations around sustainability have never been louder, yet this is not\nalways translating into action on the ground,\u201d says chief executive Clarke\nMurphy.\n\n\u201cSustainable business cannot happen without [sustainable\nleadership](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/future-ceo-esg) and change will only\noccur if companies find leaders with the right skills and motivations to drive\nsustainability outcomes alongside financial success. This will require a\nradical rethink in the way board and C-suite leaders are selected.\u201d\n\n![Role specs for sustainability](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/SB_P4_2.jpg)\n\nOf course, the rise of the chief sustainability officer role in the C-suite\nhas been marked of late, but Murphy believes that to create a truly\nsustainable company, boards must go further.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, companies that do not live and breathe their values are called\nto task by their own employees. This is not just grumbling around the\nwatercooler. When employees complain today, they do it on social media, for\neveryone to see. If a company brands itself as supporting the environment, but\nemployees know executives do not act that way, they are going to tell the\nworld,\u201d he warns.\n\n## Informing the recruitment team\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time human resources departments have had to take a\npivotal role in future-proofing an organisation to cope with emerging market\npressures.\n\nMurphy draws an interesting parallel between the necessary shift towards\nsustainability recruitment and the digitalisation revolution of a decade ago\nwhen business started to wake up to the fact that [hiring candidates with data\nacumen would be essential to growth](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/innovating-\nto-offer-a-next-generation-recruitment-strategy). That\u2019s when we began to hear\nabout companies hiring chief digital officers and chief data officers, roles\nthat are now the norm.\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t stop with C-suite appointments and companies began to\nrespond to the changes by hiring candidates, with digital competency, at all\nlevels.\n\nSimilarly, companies need to adapt their procurement policy to focus on the\nsustainability issues that are particular to their business practices so they\ncan draw on that talent pool in coming years.\n\n![C-suite sustainability priority](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/SB_P4_3.jpg)\n\nHowever, a sustainability recruitment strategy isn\u2019t just the opportunity to\nalign a business with sustainability thinking because, as we move into 2020\nand beyond, it will also become a necessity for any organisation that wants to\nattract top talent.\n\nBy 2025, millennials will comprise three quarters of the workforce and they\nbring with them a set of standards, confirmed by the 2016 CONE Communications\nEmployee Engagement Study, which found 64 per cent of millennials wouldn\u2019t\ntake a job at a company that doesn\u2019t have a strong sense of corporate social\nresponsibility.\n\n## The successful candidate will choose you\n\nThere has been a quiet revolution going on when it comes to hiring and savvy\nprocurement teams are realising that as much as they are recruiting talent,\nthe talent is also recruiting them.\n\n\u201cHiring managers who can\u2019t articulate their company\u2019s sustainability\ncredentials and goals will find it harder to attract high-quality candidates\nas they will simply go somewhere that does,\u201d argues executive graduate talent\nengagement specialist Amelia Jory.\n\n\u201cEvery day I talk to candidates who are looking for their dream role. What\u2019s\nencouraging is that the conversation rarely focuses entirely on salary, and\nthere\u2019s one \u2018must have\u2019 that comes up time and time again and that\u2019s\nsustainability.\u201d\n\nHR departments also have to ensure they not only secure the talent through\nsustainability recruitment, but that they retain and maximise it in the coming\nyears by implementing coaching and mentoring schemes, and instigate a learning\nculture where sustainability knowledge is successfully shared.\n\nThe goal is simple, but it\u2019s time critical. Identifying sustainability-focused\nleaders and corporate activists today will ease the environmental burden of\ntomorrow. It will present the C-suite with a massive opportunity to inject\n[sustainability into the very DNA of their\nbusiness.](https://www.raconteur.net/business-innovation/sustainable-business-\nreaps-rewards)\n\n# Walking the walk\n\n![](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SB_P5_1-768x432.jpg)\n\nThe Danish bioscience company Chr. Hansen was hailed as the world\u2019s most\nsustainable company in the 2 _019 Corporate Knights Global 100 Index._\n\nHowever, the accolade didn\u2019t happen overnight as sustainability became part of\nthe company\u2019s hiring process in 2015, when it formulated a \u201cpassion for a\nmeaningful cause\u201d branding strategy.\n\n\u201cWe deliberately highlight our strong sustainability profile across all\ntouchpoints, from our career section on the website to the storytelling on\nsocial media and in our job postings. It\u2019s a clear differentiator for us in\nthe war for talent,\u201d says corporate vice president Alice Larsen.\n\nShe is aware that the world is at a tipping point and sustainability is\nrapidly becoming a skill applicable in every career.\n\n\u201cWe believe that change-makers are needed in every corner of an organisation,\nnot just in a designated sustainability department. We need to have\nprofessionals in every part of the organisation who are capable of making\nconscious, sustainable decisions, whether they are scientists, number-\ncrunchers or marketers,\u201d she says.\n\nObviously, the organisation is still looking for skills and personality in the\nhiring process, but they are also seeking candidates who are looking to build\na sustainable future. \u201cWe work for a better world\u201d is one of the key tenets of\nthe company\u2019s culture model.\n\n\u201cThis is a platform which has been included in our competence-based interview\nguide for managers when hiring,\u201d says Larsen. \u201cThe hiring manager is asked to\njudge if the[ candidate upholds ethics and\nvalues,](https://www.raconteur.net/business-innovation/attract-talent-company-\npurpose) and encourages organisational and individual responsibility towards\nthe community and the environment.\n\n\u201cSustainability is indeed running through the veins of our employees, no\nmatter the function they work in.\u201d\n\nAnd these sustainability recruitment credentials don\u2019t end with a signed offer\nletter. In 2019, the company instigated a Better World campaign, which\nchallenged all employees to launch initiatives that support a sustainability\nfocus.\n\nThis focus has ensured a sustainability profile that ranges from 82 per cent\nof revenue directly supporting United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals\nto safety shoes, made from plastic waste recovered from the oceans, being\ntested at the company\u2019s plants. It\u2019s an active demonstration that when it\ncomes to environmental impact, the company not only talks the talk, it quite\nliterally walks the walk.\n\nSpecial Report\n\n[ ![Sustainable Business

The conclusion for many is that\n> the current manual, paper-laden processes are not scalable or sustainable\n> and typically result in costly redundancies, siloed data, and general\n> frustration.\n\nHaving digitized their own clinical competency management processes,\nIntermountain Healthcare has realized operational efficiencies and has\nvalidated their clinical competency content with over 3.6 million competency\nassessments. These efforts have resulted in a significant ROI with over $13\nmillion in savings in the first six years, and an amazing record of zero Joint\nCommission audit findings with their digitized competency content.\n\n\u201cDigitizing our orientation processes has been a game-changer. We started 11\nyears ago and invested significant time and resources into standardizing our\nrole-based curricula and observational assessments into required behavioral\nexpectations. Defining the exact skills each role needed and providing the\ncontent in a digital platform has made the entire organization more\nefficient,\u201d said Tammy Richards, Intermountain\u2019s Assistant Vice President of\nProfessional Practice and Learning. \u201cThis solution helps our staff work at the\ntop of their license and gets them doing the work they\u2019re qualified to do as\nquickly as possible. Working with Kahuna, we now have the opportunity to take\nwhat we\u2019ve done to a whole new level and bring this solution to our peers\nacross the healthcare industry.\u201d\n\nThe Kahuna/Intermountain solution vastly improves these processes through the\ncombination of leading-edge technology and best-in-class competency content.\nThe combined Kahuna/Intermountain solution achieves the following:\n\n  * Efficiency \u2013 Elimination of redundancies in skill assessment and training hours through automated assignment and a \u201cbuilding block\u201d approach to career development. \n\n  * Transparency \u2013 \u201cSingle pane of glass,\u201d where learning, competencies, procedures, and experience all come together to form a complete picture of each individual as well as aggregation to a unit or an entire facility or system. \n\n  * Alignment to the Future \u2013 Historically, tracking caregiver competencies has largely been about risk avoidance (i.e. audit requirements). With this digital platform, competency assurance is optimized while also enabling strategic planning for future workforce needs, employee development, tactical staffing, and flexible enterprise staffing models. With the Kahuna/Intermountain solution, organizations will put in place a foundation for capturing and structuring this data that comes ready to support these downstream processes on Day 1. \n\nKahuna brings a best-of-breed competency management platform that has been\nbuilt to serve the needs of complex global competency assurance environments.\nKahuna\u2019s CEO, Jai Shah, said of the partnership, \u201cWe have worked very hard to\nbuild a skills platform that works for regulated environments and always knew\nwe could deliver significant value in healthcare. To enter the market with a\ngold standard organization such as Intermountain Healthcare as both a customer\nand a partner is just an amazing opportunity.\u201d\n\nIntermountain provides validated competency and skills content that has been\ncurated to suit a number of various roles (nursing and non-nursing). This\ncontent library can fill the gap for systems needing assessment criteria\ndesigned by healthcare professionals and organized in a user-friendly format.\n\u201cOftentimes, the inertia in competency or skills initiatives is the lack of\nalignment on the actual content. Beyond being associated with a great brand\nlike Intermountain, the idea that we can offer such high-quality validated\ncontent to the healthcare market makes this partnership very exciting,\u201d added\nShah.\n\n\u201cOur market analysis confirmed that the competency management processes for\nclinical personnel are ripe for improvement across our industry. By partnering\nwith Kahuna, we are bringing something revolutionary to healthcare\ninstitutions by addressing very real and material inefficiencies,\u201d said Mike\nPhillips, M.D., Managing Director and Partner for Intermountain Ventures.\n\u201cWhile this partnership with Kahuna marks an important milestone for our\ninternal innovation program and for Ventures, more importantly, this solution\ncreates significant internal value while also laying a foundation for how\nother institutions can plan, develop, and deploy their clinical resources in\nthe future.\u201d\n\n**About Kahuna Workforce Solutions**\n\nKahuna Workforce Solutions is transforming competency management and workforce\nplanning.

With more than 31,000 associates, ensuring the digital competence\nof its workforce was a matter of relevance and sustainability to the\norganization. Here is how Bosch India used smart learning to build digital\ncompetencies for the present and the future.\n\n### The challenge\n\nIn an increasingly competitive world, Bosch was struggling to integrate the\neconomies of the digitalization into its core business processes as its\nworkforce was operating primarily on fuzzy definitions of new-age business and\ndigital dynamics. The organization\u2019s decade-old traditional automotive\nmanufacturing culture was further making it challenging to implement an\norganization-wide change. However, the company already had in-house expertise\nfor the Internet of Things (IoT), strong business fundamentals, and a new\nbusiness model for \u2018digital mobility\u2019 the business of the new era. The\nchallenge then, naturally, was to focus on the top weaknesses and threats,\nwhile simultaneously improving existing strengths and maintaining the market\nleadership position. Since this was a challenge that the organization was\nfacing in all geographies, the global leadership at Bosch decided to make\ndigital competence building the focal point of its plan to devise new systems,\nprocesses, and models of business operations.\n\n### The intervention\n\nA new digital competence-building model, based on the existing one, was\ndesigned to focus on digitally transforming the organizations. It encompasses\nthirteen new competencies; six technical skills like Software Engineering\n(SWE), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Digital Transformation (DT), Cloud\ncomputing, etc. and seven cross-functional competencies i.e., Business\nModeling, User Experience (UX), Agility, Change Management, etc. A clear\npathway was developed to build these competencies across all levels of\nhierarchy and function. Bosch\u2019s EDT Competence Model is designed on the\nfollowing features:\n\n  * **EDT Self-Check Tool:** A tool to facilitate learners evaluate their digital competence as per 13 competencies included in EDT Competence Model. \n  * **Basic and Advanced Programs:** Learning programs to help learners basic and advanced skills in a variety of digital competencies and also provide measures of learning for each function and competency. \n  * **Expert Qualification:** Using eUniversities and external learning platforms to help learners build expertise in their competencies, bringing in external perspectives on knowledge.\n  * **Digital Transformation Information:** To help build awareness and mindsets among learners to prepare for a digital transformation & help them realize the importance of learning and upskilling. \n  * **Training for Management:** A one-day training setup to trigger digital business modeling in leadership for all senior and middle managers.\n\nAcross all hierarchies of leadership and management, the mentioned tools,\nresources and learning suites are being provided. However, there was an\nadditional challenge of \u2018cultural change\u2019, which was suitably addressed by\nnominating department-wise \u2018change agents\u2019. Other challenges like investments\nfor these learnings, learning architecture and infrastructure were also\novercome by creating an organization-wide \u2018buy-in\u2019 by the L&D team.\n\n> The runaway success of the Bosch EDT Competence model has encouraged the\n> organization to set even more ambitious goals for the next year\n\n### The result\n\nThe learning interventions at Bosch are not only optimizing existing business\nprocesses and improving efficiency but also enabling employees and leaders to\ndevelop and implement digital business models independently. With more than 90\npercent of the learning forecast of 2019 already achieved, hundreds of\nlearners have gained expertise in complex digital competencies, like the\nInternet of Things (IoT), cybersecurity, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality\n(AR/VR), artificial intelligence, and data analytics. While 130 senior and\nmiddle managers have gained skills in digital business modeling. That\u2019s not\nall; the management has identified digital products and customers for all\nbusiness units and has also digitized several processes for partners and\nstakeholders. Digital transformation is expected to script a change in the\norganization\u2019s culture, mentorship, and learning approaches as well. Among the\nworkforce, several \u2018DigiMonks\u2019 (digital champions) have been identified in\neach business division, and they are playing a pivotal role in helping their\npeers self-evaluate, observe \u2018digital days\u2019, and experience digital immersion.\n\nThe runaway success of the Bosch EDT Competence model has encouraged the\norganization to set even more ambitious goals for the next year, as more than\n1500 associates will be made digital business modeling competent and more than\nhalf of the company\u2019s leadership will be equipped with digital skills to drive\ndigital business models independently.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Learning &

Click here to sign in.](https://login-\nsandbox.td.org/Company.aspx?ReturnUrl=referrer)\n\nShare\n\nMany people ask common questions about a competency assessment, such as, \u201cWhat\nis a competency assessment?\u201d \u201cWhy do I need one?\u201d and \u201cHow do I get started?\u201d\n\n## A Competency Assessment Compares an Individual\u2019s Skills to Requirements\n\nA competency assessment is the assessment of someone\u2019s capabilities against\nthe requirements of their job. Those requirements are defined in a competency\nmodel. To be valuable, competency models should contain only tasks and skills\nthat are critical to success in the role, not every activity they perform in\ntheir job (which comes from a traditional job task analysis).\n\nThe assessment is performed on those identified tasks and skills for which a\nrating is selected based upon how they do that task, which defines their\nproficiency level. In other words, a competency assessment measures _how_\n(behaviors) someone does the _what_ (task or skill). The individual\u2019s selected\nproficiency level is then compared with the target level, defining proficiency\nor skill gaps for each task and skill.\n\nFor example, a manager assessment without a self-assessment will not provide\nthe results you seek since there will be no buy-in to the results. Start with\na self-assessment, add a manager assessment, and optionally add those from\nsubject matter experts.\n\n## Competency Assessments Quantify the Size of Your Skill Gaps\n\nMost organizations are blissfully unaware of the quantity and size of their\nskill gaps. They know they have them, but they don\u2019t know how large or\nwidespread they are, and they can\u2019t inform organizational plans, priorities,\nand strategy. Think about that for a moment. If you don\u2019t know what you can\nand can\u2019t do, how can you be successful? How can you truly define your\norganization\u2019s strengths, which opportunities you should pursue, or what you\nshould do about it?\n\nIf you are a senior leader and you don\u2019t have competency assessment data or\nskill gap analysis, you should be scared. You\u2019re making decisions that are\nbased on inadequate data. When it comes to understanding organizational\ncapability, you don\u2019t have to be in the dark. A competency assessment shows us\nthe light. And then the best decisions can be made, including where we need to\nupskill and reskill staff.\n\n## Competency Assessments Tell You What Action to Take\n\nIf you are in a learning, talent, or effectiveness role, you are capable of\neliminating this data void. Delivering competency assessments and using them\nto create a culture of learning such that upskilling and reskilling can happen\ncontinuously, should be part of your job description. Typically, that is\nensuring that people have the skills required to do their current and future\njobs. Without skills assessment data, you have no ability to mitigate skill\ngaps effectively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce you know who does and doesn\u2019t have the required skills:  \n\n  * You can provide personalized learning to close those gaps.\n  * You can pair high performers of a specific skill with those who have that skill gap to close gaps quickly with task-based mentoring. (Read \u201c[The Value of Task-Based Mentors](https://www.td.org/insights/the-value-of-task-based-mentors).\u201d) \n  * Your talent acquisition strategy can be more focused so you hire those with the skills the organization lacks.\n\n## Competency Assessment Is Not \u201cOne and Done\u201d\n\nWhile some C-level executives think that you can do a competency assessment\nonce every few years, that\u2019s like saying you need only report company\nfinancials every five years. How could someone possibly want to invest? And in\nthis case, how can you invest well in your talent, your greatest asset?\n\nAccording to Rob Lauber, CLO at McDonald\u2019s, \u201cChange is happening so fast that\nby the time we upskill or reskill employees, some of those new skills are\nalready obsolete. We are looking at a future where millions of people will\nconstantly have to reinvent their skills.\u201d\n\nIf you want to \u201csay\u201d you\u2019ve done a competency assessment so you can check the\nbox, then just do one.\n\nBut if you want to actually drive capability in your organization, you must\ncreate the cycle of assessment, ongoing development, and reassessment _only_\non the tasks and skills you\u2019ve worked on so that you have a current picture of\ncapability at any time. Plus, you get the benefit of creating a culture of\nlifelong learning, driven by competency assessments, that drives real growth\nin your organization.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Additional Competency Assessment Uses: Career Development and Rapid\nOnboarding\n\nA competency assessment can also be used by individuals to assess their\nreadiness for other roles. People will no longer make assumptions about their\nreadiness for a role or guess at the requirements\u2014they will really know. They\ncan use the personalized learning recommendations as a career development plan\ntemplate to take specific action to plan for the role they desire. ( [More\nAbout Career Planning](https://www.td.org/insights/how-to-use-competency-\nmodels-for-career-planning))\n\nA competency assessment during the first few days of onboarding tells the new\nhire exactly what it looks like to be good and great in the job. No more\nfumbling. It shows them what action to take to close any gaps so they can own\ntheir development. Not only will it speed their time to proficiency, but it\nwill eliminate the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that leads to early exits\nwithin the first six months.\n\n## How to Get Started Assessing\n\nYou need at least two, but preferably three, elements for a competency\nassessment:  \n\n  1. a role-based competency model for those to assess\n  2. a competency assessment system to facilitate scale, privacy, and capability analytics\n  3. personalized learning to create individual reskill and upskill action plans.\n\nThe system is important because historically used tools, such as spreadsheets\nsent around, lack the privacy and control required globally (for example\nGDPR). And the volume of skills inventory data will be substantial. You need a\nsystem that will crunch it and create data visualizations you can use without\nmanual effort, or else you\u2019ll have lots of insightful data that is never used.\n\nWhile you could capture capability data with only the first two elements, you\ncan\u2019t affect skill gap closure. Knowledge without an action plan will get you\nonly so far.\n\nRecognize the self-awareness that comes when an individual realizes that they\ncan\u2019t do their job as well as they need to. They will buy into that there is\naction they need to take. If you provide personalized learning they can use to\ncreate and work an individual development plan or action plan, you have a\nchance to set each person on a path toward continuous learning.\n\n**[To learn more, join me at ATD 2020 International Conference&\nEXPO.](https://atdconference.td.org/)**  \n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [ATD Competency Model](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=ATD%20Competency%20Model)\n  * [Career Development Programs](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Career%20Development%20Programs)\n  * [Individual Development Plans](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Individual%20Development%20Plans)\n  * [My Career](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=My%20Career)\n  * [Skills Gap](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Skills%20Gap)\n  * [Talent Management](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Talent%20Management)\n  * [Workforce Planning](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Workforce%20Planning)\n\n[ ](https://www.td.org/user/about/CherylLasse-000001)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[Cheryl Lasse](https://www.td.org/user/about/CherylLasse-000001)\n\nCheryl Lasse is SkillDirector\u2019s managing partner.

Today, job seekers and job holders alike are all driving\naround without a map. Tomorrow, the competency marketplace will provide a GPS\nto help employees (current or aspiring) to navigate from point A to point B.\nYour dream is to become a business analyst with a focus on data visualization,\nbut you dropped out of community college two years ago? The competency\nmarketplace will allow you to figure out the most efficient path to gaining\nthe competencies you require, as indicated by actual job descriptions in your\nregion.\n\nI\u2019ve been talking about the competency marketplace for five years and have\noften referenced [LinkedIn](https://venturebeat.com/2015/04/16/linkedin-eats-\nthe-university-2/) as the likely winner in this revolution. Its acquisition of\nLynda.com (now LinkedIn Learning) marked a leap ahead for the field, pairing\ninsights from across the LinkedIn network with ready access to courses that\ncan help learners to land a job \u2013 or [boost their\nincome](https://money.cnn.com/2017/01/12/technology/project-management-\nlinkedin/index.html). Last year, I wrote about the [rollout of Skill\nInsights](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryancraig/2018/11/12/opening-the-door-\nto-linkedins-learning-store/#1c81c340430d), which allows organizations to\nidentify how many employees have a particular skill, and deliver the most\nrelevant LinkedIn Learning courses and learning paths to address those gaps.\nNow, with last fall\u2019s acquisition of Glint, LinkedIn is not just taking on the\nchallenge of employee competencies, it is establishing the first competency\nmarketplace for managers.\n\nLinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nLinkedIn\u2019s new twist on the competency marketplace provides a GPS for managers\nto improve their own performance, specifically with regard to employee\nengagement. If a manager\u2019s employees aren\u2019t engaged, they\u2019re almost certainly\nnot a productive, functioning team. And if not, the manager needs a clear\npathway to improving employee engagement.\n\nThis is where Glint comes in. Founder Jim Barnett is passionate about high-\nfunctioning teams and recognized that while executives have real-time\ndashboards for all sorts of KPIs, there was no dashboard for team performance.\nIn addition, most companies performed annual employee engagement surveys, but\ncompletely separate from annual reviews, not to mention from goal setting and\nlearning and development. Even best-in-class employers weren\u2019t immune and\ntypically failed to break the infrequent data down to the level of the team\nand manager. Barnett\u2019s key insight was that, just as going to the doctor for\nan annual physical isn\u2019t typically effective in helping you get into shape, in\norder to improve manager effectiveness, individual managers require regular\nfeedback to boost employee engagement. So the Glint platform is designed to\nprovide managers actionable real-time data \u2013 more effective than the\ntraditional top-down model, providing feedback to the CEO and the HR team.\n\nLinkedIn\u2019s competency marketplace for managers begins with frequent, short\nengagement surveys, which Glint calls \u201cpulses.\u201d Pulses are typically sent\nquarterly: 15-20 questions, taking 3-4 minutes. The feedback is provided\nimmediately to managers who see not only results, but a clear action plan.\nFirst, each manager is provided with insights from the data \u2013 both strengths\nand opportunities. (And for any employee groups Glint deems to be \u201cat risk,\u201d\nmanagers are delivered \u201cattrition alerts.\u201d) Next, Glint recommends 1-3\nspecific focus areas that are likely to provide the biggest engagement lift\nfor the team. Then, for each area of improvement, the manager is provided with\n8-10 suggested actions. Finally, the manager is connected to on-demand\nlearning content such as articles or videos for each strategy. It\u2019s up to the\nmanager to select the strategy and learning material, but she knows she\u2019ll\nreceive feedback again in three months, and her managers will be looking for\nimprovement.\n\nWhile Glint hasn\u2019t yet integrated with LinkedIn Learning, Barnett sees a huge\nopportunity. His goal is to embed learning into the flow of work to ensure\nthat managers are participating in the competency marketplace for managers on\na daily basis.\n\nWhereas LinkedIn\u2019s original conception of the competency marketplace empowers\nworkers to focus on skill development and career opportunities, its new\ncompetency marketplace for managers empowers employers to focus on manager\ndevelopment and enterprise advancement. What they have in common is that both\ncapture and utilize data in new ways and have the potential to change how we\nthink about human resources.\n\n[![Ryan Craig](https://blogs-images.forbes.com/ryancraig/files/2019/01/Ryan-\nCraig_avatar_1546647261-400x400.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryancraig/\n\"Photo of Ryan Craig\")\n\n[Ryan Craig](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryancraig/)\n\nI am the author of College Disrupted (2015) and A New U: Faster Cheaper\nAlternatives to College (2018).

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nKathi Graham-Leviss\n\nKathi Graham-Leviss is President of [XBInsight](http://www.xbinsight.com/), an\ninnovative HR technology company that offers customized talent assessments and\ncoaching.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nFor most organizations today, chances are high that many of the company\u2019s\nmanagement roles are currently filled by a millennial. In fact, one\n[report](https://www.upwork.com/press/2014/10/29/hiring-managers-say-\nmillennials-surpass-prior-generations-in-several-key-business-skills-new-\nstudy-reveals-2/) says 28% of millennials are managers today, but workplace\nleadership is expected to be two-thirds millennial by 2024.\n\nHowever, in my experience coaching millennial managers, there are some\nchallenges that are important to navigate as more millennials move into\nleadership and management positions, including how to impart effective\nmanagement skills and competencies to do their job well. In fact, according to\n[research](https://experts.randstadusa.com/hubfs/Randstad_GenZ_Millennials_Collide_Report.pdf)\nmy firm conducted with a client company, millennials themselves pointed to\nseveral competency areas their education did not prepare them for, including\nconflict resolution, managing other people, working in a team and working with\nolder people.\n\nBeyond the critical importance of developing millennials\u2019 management skills,\norganizations must also contend with a potential turnover issue if leadership\ndevelopment is not offered to them. For example, a report by\n[Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-\nDeloitte/deloitte-2019-millennial-survey.pdf#page=16) (download required)\nfound that 28% of millennials likely to leave in the next two years are\nunhappy with how their skills are being developed.\n\n**Key Competencies To Develop Among Your Millennial Managers**\n\nNow is the time for employers to address any leadership or management skill\ngaps among its millennial workforce, particularly given the fast pace at which\nthese younger workers are filling the roles of departing baby boomers.\n\nThere are several competencies and skills that are critical to developing\namong millennial managers, many of which relate to emotional intelligence\n(EQ).\n\n**1\\. Effective Communication**\n\nMany new managers may find themselves getting caught up in their busy, day-to-\nday schedules and neglecting to take the time to listen and communicate with\nemployees. The intricacies of workplace communication -- how we say things and\nwhat tactics we employ -- have become more complex and can be a major barrier\nto effective management. The ability to demonstrate effective verbal\ncommunication can go a long way to improve day-to-day relationships and garner\nthe respect of team members.\n\nTo help build these skills in your millennial manager:\n\n\u2022 Provide consistent feedback on their verbal and written communication\nstrengths and development opportunities.\n\n\u2022 Use coaching questions to help them identify ways to improve communication,\nsuch as:\n\n1\\. \"Give me some examples of situations where you believe you did a poor,\nadequate, or excellent job speaking.\"\n\n2\\. \"When do you become tongue-tied?\"\n\n3\\. \"What can you do to improve your communication in those situations where\nyou are less confident?\"\n\n\u2022 Urge managers to consider the behavioral style differences of their team\nmembers and learn how to adapt to other communication preferences.\n\n\u2022 Encourage managers to write out relevant points they want to make prior to\ntheir conversations or meetings, and to reread emails before sending to ensure\ntheir message is clear.\n\n\u2022 Provide 360-degree assessments or feedback on their ability to communicate\narticulately in specific situations, and the kind of messages their\nsubordinates and others feel they are sending, both verbally and nonverbally.\n\n**2\\. Teamwork**\n\nTeamwork is the secret that makes organizations perform at a high level. The\nnature of today\u2019s business landscape requires workgroups to perform well\ntogether. Part of building an effective team is uncovering and understanding\nthe behaviors and personalities of its members. Help your millennial manager\nrecognize and appreciate the different behavioral styles of each staff member.\n\nConsider using talent assessments to help your millennial manager better\nunderstand:\n\n\u2022 The problem-solving and decision making approach of all team members, and\nhow different styles work best together to achieve results.\n\n\u2022 People\u2019s values, needs and preferences. For example, some people value\nprestige and recognition, others value the political game, while others value\ncontinuous achievement.\n\n\u2022 How to offer performance feedback when needed and train and coach their\nemployees.\n\n\u2022 How to effectively share their vision and values for team collaboration.\n\n\u2022 How to set clear expectations and deadlines and regularly get updates on\nprogress. If deadlines are missed, they should take time to understand why.\nOpenly discuss performance problems so that others know where they stand and\nwhat to do differently.\n\n\u2022 How to conduct and participate in a team-building exercise. This will help\ntheir team members approach things from a \"we\" or \"team\" orientation.\n\n**3\\. Influence**\n\nA manager\u2019s ability to influence and persuade others is an essential\nleadership skill, particularly when overseeing older generations. The ability\nto affect others\u2019 actions, decisions, opinions or thinking is essential to\nsecuring genuine commitment to objectives, more engaging working relationships\nand, ultimately, higher productivity and performance.\n\nMany millennial managers lack strong expertise in this area, failing to\npresent rationale to support their position or build a common vision with\nwhich their team can identify. To help millennial managers address this\ncritical skill, consider:\n\n\u2022 Providing opportunities for them to build relationships with key leaders in\nyour organization. Share what you know about each leader\u2019s goals, priorities\nand communication preferences.\n\n\u2022 Helping them prepare for important meetings to ensure they are able to ask\nthought-provoking questions and weigh in on decisions when appropriate to be\nseen as a true contributor to the discussion.\n\n\u2022 Providing ongoing feedback on the manager\u2019s strengths and development\nopportunities to help him/her be a more impactful influencer.\n\n\u2022 Helping them develop assertiveness skills. Assertive people focus on getting\ntheir own needs met while considering the needs of others. Provide them\ntraining or development strategies to learn how to present their ideas,\nopinions and suggestions in a direct, yet unemotional manner.\n\n\u2022 Asking them to read about influencing without power. Encourage them to\ninvolve others in decisions and plans to cultivate a sense of ownership and\ncommitment to outcomes.\n\n**Start Empowering Your Millennial Managers**\n\nOften, many leaders simply see talent development initiatives as a time-\nconsuming, bureaucratic exercise. However, when talent development is not\nviewed as valuable in the organization, it\u2019s difficult for millennial managers\nto take it seriously.\n\nIf you want a high-performing, engaged millennial manager, start making their\ndevelopment of key competencies and skills a priority. Assist managers in\nidentifying specific areas of strength and opportunities for development, as\nwell as behaviors that may be blocking their growth. Competency assessments\nare a powerful tool in helping benchmark the performance of your millennial\nmanagers today and measuring their progress over time.\n\n[Forbes Coaches\nCouncil](http://www.forbescoachescouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is\nan invitation-only community for leading business and career coaches. **_[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbescoachescouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)_**\n\n\n\n[![Kathi Graham-Leviss](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbescoachescouncil/files/2018/12/kathigrahamleviss_avatar_1544651666-400x400.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/people/kathigrahamleviss/\n\"Photo of Kathi Graham-Leviss\")\n\n[Kathi Graham-\nLeviss](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/people/kathigrahamleviss/)\n\nKathi Graham-Leviss is President of [XBInsight](http://www.XBInsight.com), an\ninnovative HR technology company that offers customized talent assessments and\ncoaching.\u2026\n\n Read More\n\nKathi Graham-Leviss is President of [XBInsight](http://www.XBInsight.com), an\ninnovative HR technology company that offers customized talent assessments and\ncoaching.\n\n Read Less\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Kathi Graham-Leviss&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: Key Competencies To Develop Among Millennial Managers %0A Author: Kathi Graham-Leviss %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2019/08/12/key-competencies-to-develop-among-millennial-managers/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

Possibilities are,\nyou may face one of the following feedback from your employees when they hear\nthe word, \u2018performance management\u2019:\n\n  * The process creates anxiety and stress\n  * The overall process of performance evaluation is draining and time-taking\n  * It is just a one-way communication\n  * The performance reviews are, more often than not, inaccurate and filled with biases\n\nIn a workplace as dynamic and multigenerational as today, the right approach\nto performance has become enormously important in accelerating growth,\nboosting motivation and engagement and thereby, curbing attrition. In that\nregard, it is critical to shift performance ownership from management to\nemployees for everyone to evolve and put more skin in the game.\n\nHowever, since most Gen X / Gen Y employees have been experiencing performance\nmanagement in a very traditional even conventional kind of way, there are a\nfew quandaries and questions that every organization and employee is bound to\nhave: \u201cWhat do I have to do to own my own performance?\u201d, \u201cHow do I get more\nclarity if my performance is contributing to the larger growth of the org?\u201d,\n\u201cAre my organization\u2019s goals syncing with the needs of the market?\u201d, \u201cWhat am\nI to expect when my organization says \u2018own your performance\u2019?\u201d, \u201cCan ALL\nemployees own their performance?\u201d, \u201cWhat should the focus areas be?\u201d, \u201cWill a\nlot of guidance be required?\u201d, \u201cWill there be a great amount of effort going\ninto change management?\u201d, \u201cApart from the possible increase in financial\nperformance, are there other avenues that will get affected through an\nemployee-owned performance system?\u201d,\u201cAre my managers equipped to handle this\nchange and provide adequate support?\u201d\n\nThe need of the hour is for HR to offer strategies and uncover solutions that\ncan enable organizations to effectively shift ownership of performance to\ntheir employees.\n\n**This is how you can empower employees to take charge of their own\nperformance:**\n\n### Mentor them to craft their own goals:\n\nIdentify your employees\u2019 professional goals and help by offering them a\nframework to establish their short term and long term goals. Let them assess\nhow these goals would benefit them as well as the organization. When employees\nalign their goals with the company, it helps them see whether they fit into\nthe organization or not. It also allows them to understand what they are\nexpected to focus on , and how they will manage their performance to achieve\nthose goals.Additionally, personal goals really need to be driven by the\nemployee. Handing them a list of things that you want them to do will not\ninspire them or make them feel engaged in the process beyond a point. So,\nallow them to identify opportunities and goals which they themselves want to\npursue and that which will help them grow.\n\n### Enable them to initiate performance conversations:\n\nBy default, most performance evaluations focus on correcting past mistakes,\nidentifying skill gaps and calling out personal weaknesses. Often managers are\nbiased toward recent events or continue to emphasize problems long after the\nfact. Hence, most of the time employees dread performance conversations. To\nreally drive a successful performance programme, employees should receive\nmeaningful feedback that is timely, actionable direction, and can play an\ninstrumental role in shaping their performance. One of the ways of achieving\nthis is by empowering employees to initiate and drive their performance\nconversations with their managers and other stakeholders.\n\nTechnologies today incorporate functionalities like monthly or quarterly\ncheck-in, continuous feedback, and 360\u00b0 feedback which allows employees to\ncollect feedback from multiple stakeholders within and even outside the\norganization, to enable a holistic, unbiased and balanced evaluation their\nperformance.\n\n### Have them conduct periodic self-reviews:\n\nEmployees should be asked to conduct a self-review on how they think they are\nliving out the company values before managers and employees sit for official\nend-of-year review. It gives them a chance to reflect on their own personal\ndevelopment and gives managers a chance to assess the employees\u2019 self-\nawareness of their worth and buy-in to company culture, which always has a\ndirect correlation to metric-driven performance.\n\n### Empower them to craft their learning journey:\n\nBy taking charge of their performance management, employees are able to\nvisualize their learning path and, within that road map, adjust their course\nto address their specific weaknesses, strengths, and learning goals.\n\nEncourage employees to have a separate conversation with their managers on\ntheir individual development goals. Those conversations should enable them to\nhave open conversations about what skills they want to acquire, which course\nthey want to do and how managers can support them in pursuing the learning\ngoals.\n\nMaking the performance management system owned by employee may seem like a\nchallenging task at first. However, with an arsenal of technologies available,\nthe process can be made impactful with features like Continuous Feedback,\nCompetency Mapping and Individual Development Plans for both managers and\nemployees. Besides these, there are also other comprehensive features, such as\nGoal Cascading, Succession Planning, Multi-stakeholder Feedback. That not only\nenables better alignment of the employee\u2019s goals with those of the\norganization and leadership, but also enables employees to drive their\nperformance conversation and assessment.\n\nTo know more about creating a new-age employee-led performance management\nprogramme, attend the webinar on [How to slingshot growth by making employee\nthe owner of Performance\nManagement?](https://www.peoplematters.in/webcast/watch-making-employee-the-\nowner-of-performance-management \"Webinar\") Register yourself\n[here](https://www.peoplematters.in/webcast/watch-making-employee-the-owner-\nof-performance-management) for the webinar.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Performance Management](/category/compensation-\nperformance/performance-\nmanagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=performance-management \"Browse\nmore in: Performance Management\"), [#Smarter Work Life](/tag/smarter-work-\nlife?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=smarter-work-life \"Browse more in:\nSmarter Work Life\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Anushree Sharma](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1500295266/authors/anushree-\nsharma.jpg)](/author/anushree-sharma)\n\n#### [Anushree Sharma](/author/anushree-sharma)\n\nAnushree is an Assistant Manager- Content at People Matters.

The group showed:\n\n  * Significant improvement in all aspects of EI, with an average improvement of 12%.\n  * A significant increase across 7 scores most notably Self Regard (+21%), the primary aspect of EI that underpins all other scales, and Reflective Learning (+18%).\n  * Scores higher than the comparison group in 3 areas - Regard for Others (+10%), Authenticity (+10%) and Trust (+6%).\n  * Scores the same as the comparison group in 7 areas, and below the comparison group in just 6 areas.\n  * An improvement of 13% in both feelings scales (Self Awareness and Awareness of Others).\n\nNeurodiversity is an umbrella term used to describe those of us whose brains\nand thinking styles are slightly different to the norm.\n\nLots of businesses currently attach little value to these behaviours, with\ncompetency frameworks that merely assess and reward for behavioral norms. This\npaper shows why, and how, an understanding of how to value and nurture\ndivergent thinking styles can improve performance and well-being.\n\nDr. Jo Maddocks, Chief Psychologist at PSI Talent Management, said,\nneurodiversity is a term that many of us in the corporate world are becoming\nfamiliar with.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637214460857116193.jpg)](/au/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-worklife-balance/218771)\n\n#### [Fun Friday: 5 TED Talks on work/life\nbalance](/au/specialisation/employee-engagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-\nworklife-balance/218771)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0223_637215104111082460.jpg)](/au/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/how-to-keep-mental-health-on-track-during-remote-working/218895)\n\n#### [How to keep mental health on track during remote\nworking](/au/specialisation/employee-engagement/how-to-keep-mental-health-on-\ntrack-during-remote-working/218895)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637215071772967347.jpg)](/au/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218863)\n\n#### [Awkward 'mistake' on video call goes viral](/au/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218863)\n\n\"But to date there has been little understanding of how to nurture the non-\ntypical thinking styles that are crucial for innovation in our fast-changing\nworld,\" said Dr. Jo Maddocks.\n\n\"This new study supports the view that developing attributes of EI can help\nneurodivergent individuals to work to their strengths and cope with the\nemotional and functional challenges that they face at work. It's not about\nchanging people but helping them to learn to manage their emotions and their\nrelationships to become happier and more effective at work.\"\n\nCathy Harris, Director at Executive Resilience Coaching added that it's time\nfor a paradigm shift in HR practices which recognises the relationship between\npeoples' emotional state and their effectiveness.\n\n\"Ultimately, we're looking to help people fulfill their potential in a healthy\nway. This requires teaching people how to manage anxiety, attention, and\nenergy levels in healthy and effective ways as well as raising awareness for\nHR professionals.\"\n\n### Related stories\n\n  *

Click here to sign in.](https://login-\nsandbox.td.org/Company.aspx?ReturnUrl=referrer)\n\nShare\n\nWith the release of its new [Talent Management Capability\nModel](https://www.td.org/capability-model/access), the Association for Talent\nDevelopment serves TD professionals with the most comprehensive compilation of\nskills, concepts, and strategies necessary to fulfill their roles. It is\nimportant to emphasize that those efforts can achieve maximum impact only when\nguided by a comprehensive talent management (TM) strategy.\n\nATD\u2019s new model groups capabilities into three domains: building personal\ncapability, developing professional capability, and impacting organizational\ncapability. Talent strategy and management is one of the model\u2019s 23\ncapabilities and resides in the impacting organizational capability domain.\n\nA TD professional with capability in talent strategy and management will need\nknowledge of:  \n\n  * talent management functions (for example, workforce planning, acquisition, employee development, performance management, and compensation and rewards)\n  * succession planning and talent review processes (for example, assessment, scenario planning, talent mobility, and critical roles identification) \n  * methods to identify the critical requirements of tasks, jobs, and roles (for example, job analysis, competency modeling, and leadership competency development), \n  * talent acquisition strategies and concepts (for example, talent mobility, employment branding, sourcing, passive and active recruiting, and onboarding), and approaches for identifying and developing high potential talent.\n\nAccording to _[Capabilities for Talent\nDevelopment](https://www.td.org/books/capabilities-for-talent-development )_\n(ATD Press), to fulfill capability requirements, TD professionals need to be\nskilled at:  \n\n  * creating and aligning the talent development vision and strategy with the organizational and business vision and strategy \n  * designing and implementing strategic plans for talent development projects, programs, or functions \n  * identifying anticipated constraints or problems affecting talent development initiatives (for example, resource deficiencies or lack of support) \n  * establishing and executing a marketing strategy to promote talent development \n  * communicating how talent development strategies and solutions support the achievement of targeted business and organizational results\n  * communicating the value of learning and professional development \n  * developing workforce plans that articulate current and future talent and skill requirements designing and implementing a performance management strategy.\n\nAmong TD veterans recognized for leadership in this area is Martha Soehren,\nwho transitioned from CTDO to senior vice president of HR at Comcast in\nNovember as she prepares for a July 2020 retirement. Throughout her career,\nSoehren has appreciated the importance of a multifaceted talent management\nstrategy built on fundamentals.\n\n\u201cFor a TM strategy to work effectively, it must be embraced from the top\ndown,\u201d she insists. \u201cOver time, it evolves from the bottom up, especially in\nthe evaluation of talent and the determination of successors for key roles\nwithin the organization.\u201d She adds that it\u2019s important to build a \u201cholistic\nsupport system\u201d for such activities rather than conduct them on a piecemeal\nbasis.\n\nThose activities must be tightly connected to development, Soehren says.\n\u201cRegardless of whether that development is formal or informal, internal or\nexternal, high potential or broad-based, there must be a way to help build\nfuture capabilities so that people can progress and align with both short- and\nlong-term objectives.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut most importantly, she believes, talent management and development must be\nrigidly aligned with the business.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not easy and people don\u2019t always do it,\u201d Soehren observes. \u201cAfter all,\nit\u2019s difficult to build those relationships that get you a \u2018seat at the\ntable.\u2019 We have to earn that seat by showing that we\u2019re learning the business,\nthat we\u2019re operationally focused, that we \u2018get\u2019 L&D, and that we achieve\nmeasurable impact to support our initiatives.\u201d\n\nSoehren believes that some TD professionals are often \u201cso tied up with the\ndidactics of L&D that they overlook the connection between learning impact and\nbusiness impact.\u201d She says some have even abandoned the practice of measuring\nTD impacts entirely because their companies don\u2019t expect a return-on-\ninvestment of training.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sure not my world,\u201d she muses. Comcast\u2019s senior executives expect to\nknow the precise difference that learning makes for employees and hold her\naccountable. The scenario includes a heightened priority regarding inclusion\nof women and people of color in the workforce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes that accountability can surface in ways one can\u2019t envision, such as\nin 2014 when Comcast announced its intent to acquire Time Warner. Comcast\nUniversity was ordered to identify top talent within Time Warner for possible\nreassignment to new roles within the combined company. For six months, Soehren\nand teammates visited Time Warner markets to meet with key talent and high\npotentials for the proposed new organization.\n\nThe merger was ultimately quashed by the U.S. Justice Department but not\nbefore Soehren and colleagues learned some valuable lessons. Among them: \u201cWhen\nyou\u2019re going through that period of analysis, you have to evaluate the best\n_and_ the weakest of both companies so that you emerge with the best of the\nbest,\u201d she reports.\n\nShe says that\u2019s not an easy process because \u201cyou must accept that your own\nteam isn\u2019t composed of all A players, and that this is an opportunity to up\nyour game for your organization.\u201d\n\nSoehren also has strategic thoughts about the future of her profession. \u201cIn\nthe world of L&D, we haven\u2019t nailed down what it means to work and lead within\na global, digital organization. Learning leaders have a great opportunity to\ndefine what that looks like and set the stage for success\u2014not just for the\nlearning organization but for business leaders too,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cLearning leaders, trainers and program managers will all be operating and\ntraining differently. They will have to learn a new kind of software set and\nother technologies. As a result, I believe most L&D professionals will become\nlearning coaches and learning builders.\u201d  \n\nExplore the Talent Development Capability Model\n\nATD's new Talent Development Capability Model sets the standard for what TD\nprofessionals should know and do to be successful.

In today\u2019s day and age there\ncannot be a more perfect meeting place for human and artificial intelligence\n(AI) than human resources (HR). The synergy of the two is all set to transform\nthe way organizations recruit, assess, manage and motivate talent.\n\nOne has to understand that AI is not set to put HR executives out of work,\nrather it is set to transform HR departments across organizations. Therefore,\nit is not surprising that many see AI as having the potential to transform and\nalter key HR functions, such as recruiting, performance evaluation and\ncapability development.\n\nKPMG International\u2019s latest global survey _The Future of HR 2019_ , indicates\nthat 60% of HR executives feel \u201cvery confident\" about HR\u2019s actual ability to\ntransform and move them forward via key capabilities like analytics and AI.\n\nTalent acquisition, for example, is a key responsibility for an HR department.\nA question which an organization should ask oneself is how do we ensure that\nwhat we have hired is indeed talent as there can be scenarios whereby a\nstreet-smart employee fails to live up to potential.\n\nPertinent to note is HR departments in organizations are inhabited by fallible\nhumans and are not immune to human bias in such situations. AI here can help\nrestructure such processes with the help of analytical processing of data\ninstead of on individual observations.\n\nFor a start, AI can help in designing questions for an interview that wholly\ndisregard someone\u2019s background at the expense of focusing on their competency\nfor a role. These questions more often than not are based on an individual\u2019s\nearlier work records and, the pre- requisites of the job they apply for. Also,\nAI\u2019s assistance with talent management helps the personnel in charge of\nperformance evaluation. An employee\u2019s performance can generate volumes of\ndata, which AI can sort out within minutes, further aiding HR managers with\nswift access to systemized insights.\n\nOddly though, while organizations in India are recognizing how AI can drive\nsignificant value in HR, they are in the minority by a long way. The KPMG\nInternational survey revealed that a mere 50% of HR functions have started to\nintroduce AI and only 26% have invested in AI in the past.\n\nThis indicates that India is marked with a series of dichotomies. Though HR\nleaders here have shown the intent to strive towards transforming their\nbusinesses and HR functions like their global counterparts, a majority of them\nwant to take it slow, doing so at the risk of becoming outdated and\nirrelevant.\n\nLastly, the HR department is probably the most promising field to put AI to\nuse as they are the first line in dealing with the \u201chuman\" component of their\nbusinesses. AI, could serve as a great ally to them at each stage, right from\nsourcing talent, shortlisting applicants, screening, on-boarding and\nperformance assessment, making it a key tool in HR management, with benefits\nthat are already ripe for picking.\n\n_Vishalli Dongrie is partner and head (people and change) at KPMG India._\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Facebook Share\")\n[](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Opinion  The role of Artificial\nIntelligence in talent management - https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-\nnews/opinion-the-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-talent-\nmanagement-1562770611228.html %0a%0a%0aDownload mint app for latest in\nBusiness News - https://bit.ly/32XEfFE) [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Linkedin\nShare\") [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Tweet\")\n\nShare Via\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Facebook Share\")\n[](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Opinion | The role of Artificial\nIntelligence in talent management - https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-\nnews/opinion-the-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-talent-\nmanagement-1562770611228.html %0a%0a%0aDownload mint app for latest in\nBusiness News - https://bit.ly/32XEfFE) [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Linkedin\nShare\") [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Tweet\")\n\nTopics\n\n[Digital Dossier](/topic/digital-dossier)\n\nClose\n\nNo Network\n\nServer Issue\n\nInternet Not Available\n\n#### Wait for it\u2026\n\nLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

analyst discussed some of the biggest challenges and\nopportunities in HR technology.\n\nBy: [Andrew R. McIlvaine](https://hrexecutive.com/author/andrew-r-mcilvaine/\n\"Posts by Andrew R. McIlvaine\") | October 2, 2019 \u2022 4 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [HR\nTechnology Conference News](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-\ntechnology-conference/) | [Top Stories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-\nstories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Bersin-700x467.jpg)\n\nIndustry leader Josh Bersin delivered the opening keynote address Wednesday\nmorning at HR Tech at the Venetian in Las Vegas.\n\nIf HR Tech attendees felt a bit overwhelmed going into the Expo hall with more\nthan 500 exhibitors, Josh Bersin wanted them to know he feels their pain.\n\n\"I've been an analyst in this space for over 20 years, and I have a lot of\nrespect for the vendors in this space, but you as HR leaders have to make\nsense of all this and so many of you have told me there are just so many\noptions,\" said the global industry analyst, who delivered the opening keynote\non the second day of HR Tech.\n\n[**VIDEO: See Josh Bersin 's interview about his report with\n_HRE_.**](https://hrexecutive.com/watch-josh-bersin-talks-hr-tech-trends/)\n\nThe title of Bersin's presentation, \"Untangling the HR Technology Market,\"\nreflects the sheer volume of activity that's been swirling in the space for\nthe past 10 years. Boosted by billions in venture capital funding, the market\nalso reflects the fact that the very nature of work is changing, he said.\n\n\"The job market is hot and yet we also have this problem of lagging\nproductivity,\" said Bersin. \"This gap is getting bigger and it's born by the\nstress, workload, engagement and health and sleep of employees. So there's\nthis huge market for HR tech as wellbeing, engagement, productivity and\nretention become core, rather than nice-to-haves.\"\n\n[**HR Tech 2019: How agile innovated Walmart 's\nhiring**](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-how-agile-innovated-walmarts-\nhiring/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Josh-\nBersin-150x150.jpg)\n\nJosh Bersin\n\nThe latest research shows CEOs are more concerned than ever about growth and\nthat they want more creativity out of their people. \"'Curiosity is actually\nbecoming a competency,\" he said.\n\nEmployees, meanwhile, are very concerned about their jobs and careers.\n\"They're saying 'If I join your company, what am I going to get out of it for\nmy career? And that's created a new demand within the organization for\ncontinuous learning.\"\n\nMost importantly, \"we're not building software for HR anymore\u2014we're building\nit for employees,\" said Bersin. \"If employees don't find it useful, if it\ndoesn't fit into 'the flow of work,' then it's not going to be used.\"\n\n**[More from HR Tech: Follow along here for our ongoing\ncoverage.](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-technology-\nconference/)**\n\n**Employee Experience is Primary**\n\nOne of the most fundamental changes in the industry is the primacy of employee\nexperience, said Bersin. \"HR is now the secondary audience\u2014employees are the\nprimary audience. And that's shifted the market.\"\n\nVendors are focusing their attention on \"employee-centric tools\" that operate\nwithin Microsoft Outlook, Slack, Salesforce and other widely used tools, he\nsaid. \"That's the big existential thing the tech community is working on. And\nthat means there are going to be some winners and losers in the marketplace.\"\n\n**[HR Tech 2019: Five key lessons from Barbara\nCorcoran](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-5-hr-lessons-from-barbara-\ncorcoran/)**\n\nThe major vendors are trying to push themselves into the employee experience\ncategory, said Bersin.\n\n\"In the early days when I got into HR tech, there was a very clear strategy\nthat you'd go to ADP, PeopleSoft, and that was it,\" he said. \"Now we're in a\nmuch different situation. HR tech platforms at the core are becoming more like\nyour phone\u2014more like platforms in which you put apps in, and you delete apps.\nIf the apps don't take off, just shut them down. And that's the way the world\nis now\u2014someone's going to build something and you'll say 'My God, we need\nthat.' And you'll try it and it'll be great, or it won't work out and you'll\njust turn it off.\"\n\nOn top of that is the talent space and there \"We have an incredible array of\ntechnologies,\" said Bersin.\n\nTalent management vendors need to keep the following in mind, he said: \"You\nneed to think about not what you think is going to be cool, but what are the\nmanagement philosophies that are trending, and those are growth, development,\njob mobility, highly diverse, highly inclusive talent practices, transparency,\nnetwork effect\u2014those are the things senior leaders are talking about.\"\n\n**AI and Recruiting**\n\nThe area of HR tech that's the most dynamic is recruiting, said Bersin.\n\n\"AI is probably more mature in recruiting than any other part of HR,\" he said.\n\n[**HR Tech 2019: Findings** **from the just-released Sierra-Cedar\nreport**](https://hrexecutive.com/new-sierra-cedar-report-what-should-happen-\nafter-the-hr-tech-buy-in/)\n\nDiversity and inclusion has become so important that's now a significant\nmarket in its own, said Bersin. \"You can now use AI to identify biased\ninterviewing, sourcing and recruiting practices. You can at least see them and\ndo something about them.\"\n\nAI is becoming ubiquitous in HR technology, he said. \"It's hard to build an HR\nplatform of any kind without designing some kind of AI solution. AI is now\ngoing mainstream.\"\n\nVendors like Pymetrics, PhenomPeople, IBM, Oracle, Workday, HireVue are all\nincorporating AI into their products, said Bersin.\n\nFinally, employee experience platforms are big in the HR tech market.\n\n\"Vendors like ServiceNow, Deloitte, Mercer, SAP SuccessFactors, IBM, all have\nplatforms focused on the employee experience,\" he said. \"You can't expect out-\nof-the box ERP to do this. This is going to be a significant market.\"\n\nAndrew R.

All of these factors affect how companies do business and attract\nand retain talented workers.\n\n\"If we don't keep up with all the changes going on around us in terms of the\ntasks we do every day, we become obsolete,\" said Dan Schawbel, partner and\nresearch director at New York City-based Future Workplace, an executive\ndevelopment firm dedicated to rethinking and reimagining the workplace.\n\nIt's more important now than ever for business professionals to look forward\nthree or six months or even a few years, he said during a mega session at the\nSociety for Human Resource Management 2019 Annual Conference & Exposition.\n\nConference attendee Jessica Whitney said she hoped to learn about any new\ntrends for the workplace so she could compare what's discussed to what her\ncompany is currently doing\u2014to see what it's doing right and if there are any\nnew ideas she can take back to the office. Whitney is a people partner at Unum\nTherapeutics in Massachusetts.  \n\nThese are the top 10 trends that will impact HR departments in 2019, according\nto Schawbel's research.\n\n1\\. Fostering the relationship between workers and robots.\n\nOne of the biggest trends of 2019 is the partnership between robots and\nhumans. \"The human element will never go away,\" Schawbel said. HR will\ncontinue to manage the human workforce, and information technology (IT) teams\nwill manage the robots. \"The big opportunity moving forward is for HR to\npartner with IT and even other departments \u2026 in order to collaborate and\nmanage the human experience,\" he said.\n\n2\\. Creating flexible work schedules.\n\n\"Flexibility is something that we want because we're working more hours than\never before,\" he said. Regardless of age or generation, employees want to have\na life outside of work.\n\n3\\. Taking a stand on social issues.\n\nYounger workers, especially, want to work for companies that are making a\npositive difference in the world, Schawbel said. Companies that take a stand\non social issues will be unpopular with some people, he noted, but if they\nwant to attract the right talent, they have almost no choice.\n\n4\\. Improving gender diversity.\n\nCompared to men, few women hold executive positions. _The New York Times_\nreported that \"[fewer women run big companies than men named\nJohn](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/upshot/fewer-women-run-big-companies-\nthan-men-named-john.html).\" That's the bad news. \"The great news,\" Schawbel\nsaid, \"is that countries are getting involved, companies are getting involved,\nand it looks like changes are on the horizon.\"\n\n5\\. Investing in mental health.\n\nMany people either have mental disorders or interact with someone who does,\nand mental health is becoming less stigmatized as more people speak publicly\non the topic. Britain's Prince Harry, for example, is partnering with Oprah\nWinfrey and Apple on [a series about mental\nhealth](https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/10/entertainment/prince-harry-oprah-\nwinfrey-mental-health-tv-series-intl-scli-gbr/index.html) and has also asked\nemployers in the United Kingdom to sign a pledge to take a stand on this\nissue. Schawbel noted that employers who sign the pledge signal to employees\nthat they take mental health seriously.\n\n6\\. Addressing the loneliness of remote workers.\n\nMany employees today can work from wherever they want. Remote work is\ngreat\u2014and employers need to promote flexibility\u2014but there is a cost, Schawbel\nsaid. The isolation employees feel when they don't interact enough with co-\nworkers may cause them to check out. Investing in offsite and team-building\nevents can help. Connecting with remote workers in person even once a year can\nmake a huge difference and build trust, he noted.\n\n7\\. Upskilling the workforce.\n\nThere are 7.4 million open jobs in the U.S., and the unemployment rate is 3.6\npercent. So employers need to find creative ways to [close the skills\ngap](/ResourcesAndTools/legal-and-compliance/employment-law/Pages/3-Ways-HR-\nCan-Help-Close-the-Skills-Gap.aspx). Companies are starting to hire more older\nworkers, workers with disabilities, workers who were formerly incarcerated and\nveterans. \"The [talent] pool is getting wider and wider, which is great,\"\nSchawbel said. \"It's great because talent can come from anywhere.\" Companies\nare less focused on age, gender and other factors and more concerned with\n[whether the person can do the job](/hr-today/news/hr-news/Pages/SHRM-CEO-\nCalls-for-More-Inclusive-Workplaces.aspx) and work well with others, he added.\n\n _[SHRM members-only toolkit : _[_Employing Older\nWorkers_](/resourcesandtools/tools-and-\nsamples/toolkits/pages/employingolderworkers.aspx) _]_\n\n8\\. Focusing on soft skills.\n\n\"Soft skills are the new hard skills,\" Schawbel said. Ninety-one percent of HR\nprofessionals [surveyed by LinkedIn](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-\nsolutions/blog/talent-on-tap/2019/linkedins-head-of-recruiting-weighs-in-on-\nthe-top-talent-trends-2019) believe soft skills are very important for the\nfuture of recruiting. \"You can train for hard skills, but soft skills take a\nlong time to learn,\" Schawbel noted. \"If you hire someone who has a positive\nattitude, good organizational skills, is able to delegate work \u2026 they're going\nto be incredibly valuable in today's world.\"  \n\n9\\. Preparing for Generation Z.\n\nEmployers need to understand Generation Z, the demographic born between the\nmid-1990s and mid-2000s. Many in this cohort identify anxiety as a major issue\nthat gets in the way of their workplace success, which relates to addressing\nmental health, Schawbel said. And even though Generation Z workers self-\nidentify as the digital generation, they say they want more face-to-face\ninteraction at work. Additionally, they tend to expect quick promotions, so\nemployers should set realistic expectations, he noted.  \n\n10\\. Preventing burnout.\n\nEmployees must grapple with an \"always on\" work culture, and many employees\nleave their companies as a result of being overworked. Employers should\nrecognize what causes burnout and aim to fix it, because it may cost them more\nover time if they don't, Schawbel said.\n\n\"We have to think about work differently,\" he added. \"The future is uncertain\n\u2026 but we can make changes today that will give us a better tomorrow.\"\n\n _[Visit SHRM's resource page on_[ _workforce\nreadiness_](/ResourcesAndTools/Pages/Workforce-Readiness.aspx) _.]_\n\n[Compensation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Compensation) [Employee\nRelations](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Employee Relations) [Organization\nand Employee Development](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Organization and\nEmployee Development) [Benefits](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Benefits)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Top+10+Workplace+Trends+for+2019&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/hr-\ntoday/news/hr-news/Pages/Top-10-Workplace-Trends-for-2019.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

Though the future of work may often seem murky now, it is assuring\nto know that many of the present aspects of work that we are so used to today,\nwere once mere predictions\u2026or science fiction! If the world of work\ncollectively had the power to adapt, evolve and strive ahead then, it can do\nso now too.\n\n## **What is the Future of Work?**\n\nThe future of work is a ubiquitous topic of debate and discussion and not\nwithout reason. It is always important to ask \u201cWhere are we headed?\u201d\nespecially in an environment as change-centric as ours.\n\nDeloitte\u2019s Global Human Capital Trends report for 2019, as you can see below,\nprovides an interesting slice of insight into trends to watch out for over the\nten years to come.\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Source:_ _Deloitte\u2019s 2019 Global Human Capital Trends Report_**\n\nThe report, based on a longitudinal survey of 10,000 participants across 119\ncountries, is based on what professionals today are assigning value to and\nwhat they feel are and would be the biggest opportunities and challenges to\nrise to in the next few years. With these global perceptions setting the\ncontext, let\u2019s dive into the ten key future of work trends to watch out for in\nthe next ten years.\n\n**Learn More:[What is Full Cycle Recruiting? Definition, Process and Best\nPractices](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-full-cycle-recruitment/)**\n\n## **What is the Future of Work? 10 Key Trends for the Next 10 Years**\n\nThe future of work would be born out of the present landscape at work \u2013 an\namalgamation of the need to change, the desire for speed and the demand for\naugmented experiences. Here are the ten key trends that organizations should\nprepare for.\n\n### **1\\. Learning to Learn, Unlearn and Relearn**\n\n  \nChange presupposes adaptation. With the larger environment and its smaller\nmoving parts undergoing digital and technological tectonic shifts, is it not a\nsurprise that professionals across the globe perceive learning as the most\nimportant trend to prepare for.\n\n**Hawley Kane, Head of Organizational Talent and Leadership Development at\nSaba Software** says, \u201cHands down we see the connection of learning to\nperformance as being the a-ha moment for L&D.; Here\u2019s the crux of it: For\nhigh-performing organizations, learning is not the outcome - it is the\nbehavior that drives performance.\u201d Hawley adds that learning and performance\nmanagement do not merely co-exist - they are dependent on one another. To\ndeliver learning experiences that move the needle on performance, talent\nleaders need to empower employees to drive their own development with learning\nthat is aligned to the individual, the team and relatable business goals.\n\n**Heide Abelli, Senior Vice President, Content Product Management at\nSkillsoft** feels that a huge trend to watch out for in organizational\nlearning is \u201cthe growing sense of urgency to address gaps in the readiness of\nthe workforce to execute on the digital agenda. With the introduction of new\nroles, the elimination of outdated roles, the increased scope of\nresponsibility in key roles and the removal of management layers, the\nchallenge around talent readiness is enormous.\u201d\n\nLearning is inextricably connected to the workings of any organization, more\nso today than ever before and the way organizations learn is changing.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/) **\n\n### **2\\. Driving Employee Experience**\n\n  \nWe live experientially. The rising importance of the user interface has\nextended to the workplace as well. At work, however, the employee experience\nis not limited to the technological interfaces alone \u2013 every interaction that\nan employee has with the organization right from the stage of candidacy to\nwhen the employee leaves or retires.\n\n\u201cAt the crux of all business transformation, there are people, not\ntechnology,'' says **Gajendra Chandel, the ex-CHRO of Tata Motors**. To enable\nany change, at any level, organizations need to keep in mind the experience\nthey offer to their employees, the relevance the transformation can and will\nhold for their people. They also need to craft strategies that enable people\nto do meaningful work (for them and for the business). The culture at work and\nhow diversity is managed becomes all the more important and the focus shifts\nto the individual.\n\nWith technology paving the way, organizations need to adapt to the kind of\nexperience employees want. All aspects of talent management and people metrics\nwould need to have not just the business goal in mind but also the goal of\nproviding engaging employee experience.\n\n### **3\\. Talent Mobility v/s Stagnation and Complacency**\n\n  \nThe Echelon Group\u2019s definition of talent mobility as, \u201cthe practice of moving\npeople within an organization, in hopes that new skills will be gained and\nsharpened through the employees' new roles and responsibilities\u201d hits the nail\non the head. In the present race for talent, engagement is the key to holding\nonto the right employees. In order to engage employees long-term, there needs\nto be a culture that fights career stagnation and role immobility. Allowing\nworkers to move within the system, find their niche, have the allowance to\nswitch and find a new niche to reinvent their skillsets is a great way to help\nemployees grow and to retain them. This holds especially true in an ecosystem\nwith a rising alternative workforce.\n\nEmployees are now choosing a job based on the level of work flexibility it\noffers. Thus, quickly becoming an important parameter for job-decisions,\ntalent mobility will drive the quality of employee engagement as well as that\nof the workforce. \u201cThis is a trend that shows no signs of stopping. Thirty-\neight percent of hiring managers predict that their employees will work\npredominantly remotely in the next ten years,\u201d says **Zoe Harte, Senior Vice\nPresident, Human Resources and Talent Innovation, at Upwork**. Allowing\nremote-work could be an effective way to communicate to present and future\nemployees the organization\u2019s openness to incorporate the individual\u2019s\npreferences and growth needs into the job role.\n\n### **4\\. The Evolution of Leadership**\n\n  \nWith the work, worker and workplace changing, leaders and styles of leadership\nneed to evolve as well. With the decrease of age-based seniority, the growing\nimportance of building relationships in building employee engagement, the\ngenerational shift in the workplace majority. Redesigned managerial structures\nand the universal culture of agility, the kind of leaders that organizations\nneed and want has changed. This is not merely because of the millennial boom\nbut rather due to a mix of all the factors stated above.\n\nSallyann Della Casa, Founder at GLEAC, points out that workplaces \u201cneed to be\nemployee-centric, there is no longer any specific size that fits all. Many\nworkforces are now virtual, work at home is a normal day at the office, teams\nassemble and dis-assemble based on projects with no fixed roles or titles but\ninstead matching competencies for project needs.\" The leaders to come thus\nneed to be able to deal with such a workforce build effective relationships\nand create a winning strategy every day. The more human-centric leadership\nskills will be the greater priority in a world that gets progressively\ndependent on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and newer\ntechnologies.\n\n### **5\\. Faster, Better, Simpler HR Technology**\n\n  \nWith AI and ML making inroads into core and subsidiary HR functions, the\nfuture demands better integration. **Prithvi Shergill, Co-Founder, Co-create\nTomorrow** states, \u201c60 to 70 percent of organizations today say that they use\nAI to enhance valuation.\u201d He adds, \u201cbeing able to adopt technology is not\nalways about a mindset shift or reluctance but rather an issue of budget and\nauthority.\u201d\n\nWith HR tech becoming a trend that organizations need to adopt and adapt\neffectively, both the enterprise mindset and budget planning needs to be in\nfavor of the smoothest transformation. This applies to the selection of the\nright human capital management (HCM) tools and suites as well.\n\nSallyann says, \u201cHCM's today have to be predictive in nature interpreting and\nmaking connections with data, easy plug and playable and competency-centric.\nBy predictive, it should have an employee engagement bot that talks to a\nlearning and development system (because one of the stickiest measures of\nengagement is how much someone thinks they are learning) and send off warning\nsignals when either one goes haywire.\u201d A good HCM system should also allow\neasy plug and play features. That is where the future of HR tech needs to lead\norganizations \u2013 towards work that is easy, smart and engaging.\n\n**Learn more:[The Definitive Guide to AI in Employee\nEngagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/definitive-guide-to-ai-employee-engagement/)**\n\n### **6\\. Creativity, Collaboration, and Communication**\n\n  \nThe future of work demands that organizations invest in creating a culture\nwhere creativity thrives, collaboration is facilitated and communication is\nencouraged. The current trend of leading by example requires this cultural\nshift to be driven top-down with the effective involvement of C-suite\nemployees. Collaboration not only refers to the cooperation between teams and\nfunctions but also between business leaders and HR heads.\n\n**Engelbert Camasura, President & CEO of Asia Select, Inc.** pointed to the\nimportance of the role of HR in making the AI revolution and the digital\ntransformation a dual success. He says, \u201cCHROs need to take a bolder stand and\nbe true business leaders instead of being service delivery executives or even\njust business partners.\u201d The onus of business transformation thus needs not\nonly to be partnered by but also co-led by the HR.\n\nBeing a part of the AI revolution is an active decision to make and to stick\nby. Englebert also spoke of how data needs to be regarded not as a challenge\nbut rather as an enabling tool. Businesses thus need to make a shift and focus\non the resources-mindset-data triangle to reap the benefits of the revolution\nthat is near.\n\n**Learn more:[What Is HR Digital Transformation? Definition, Strategies, and\nChallenges](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-hr-digital-transformation/)**\n\n### **7\\. From Wellness to Happiness at Work**\n\n  \n**Dr. Rajiv Kumar, President & Chief Medical Officer of Virgin Pulse, **states\nthat the three most important reasons for organizations to embrace workforce\nwellness are:\n\n  1. Employees expect and demand that their place of employment offer this benefit. Millennials, which comprise the largest share of our workforce today, choose where they work based on a company demonstrating that it cares for them. An important way to show that care is by offering a comprehensive wellbeing program.\n  2. Bottom-up wellbeing programs are an essential tool to foster workforce collaboration and cohesion, which leads to strong, vibrant corporate cultures.\n  3. When implemented correctly, wellbeing programs can save organizations a lot of money in healthcare costs, decreased absenteeism and presenteeism, and even decreased employee attrition.\n\n  \nThe importance of mental and emotional health at work is gaining increasing\ntraction and not without reason. With AI-enabled tools to monitor and guide\nemployee health better, the trend of creating a healthier and happier\nworkforce is actively guiding organizational decisions.\n\n### **8\\. The Rise of \u201cSuperjobs\u201d**\n\n  \n**Anand Shankar, Partner, Leader \u2013 HR Transformation, Deloitte,** speaks of\n\u201csuperjobs\u201d as the natural outcome of our collaborative transformation.\nOrganizations need to start preparing for the skill-requirements of tomorrow\nand ensure that their employees are ready to rise up to the challenge.\nCreating an adept and agile talent pipeline rests on an adequately skilled\nworkforce that can collaborate with the latest technology. As AI gears up to\naugment jobs, human roles need to be augmented as well. Organizations will\nneed to relook at the implications of the transactional aspects of work being\ndone away with and even strategic decisions being aided.\n\nThus, with jobs evolving to superjobs that set the context for skill-\ndevelopment, basic processes and our understanding of them would predictably\ngo through some tweaks as well. This is a trend that is separate from the more\nwidespread updating in learning and development processes because this has to\ndo with the modification of jobs, tasks, and roles as we know them.\n\n### **9\\. A Treasure Trove of Data**\n\n  \nToday, our data universe defines who we are, and every digital experience that\ncomes our way is based on and tuned to our data identity. Even companies like\nTwitter use algorithms to make precise assumptions about our gender for\nexample simply based on our activity on the platform. All, this, just to\nexperience a world that is more personalized \u2013 more us.\n\nWhat implications do innovations such as these have on the work-worker-\nworkplace ecosystem? Employees also seek individualized interactions from\nevery aspect of work. We look for immersive experiences in what is \u201cno longer\nan Internet of Things (IoT) but rather an Internet of Me (IoM)\u201d, as **Shawn\nDuBravac, Founder & President at the Avrio Institute **puts it. \u201cThe interface\nof information is changing how we interact with technology,'' adds Shawn. As\nwe move from a digitized environment to a datafied one, organizations need to\nbe able to keep up with this abundance of data in order to avoid scarcity of\ninformation.\n\nThis is what businesses of the near-future would need to mine intelligently to\ndeep-dive into a ready, on-demand pool of information to make better\ndecisions, create happier workplaces and lead to greater business success.\n\n### **10\\. Winning with diversity**\n\n  \nWith data analytics and AI-enabled tools striving to create decision-making as\nprejudice-free as possible, a mature conversation on diversity appears to be a\nquickly evolving trend. More companies today are coming forward to recognize\nthe need for proper diversity education and not just sensitization. With that,\nthe dialogue has shifted from having a laundry list for diversity and\ninclusion (DI) initiatives to more meaningful and actionable plans that could\nactually make a difference.\n\n\u201cInequity in the workplace breeds lack of consumer loyalty while inclusive\ncultures can yield a stronger customer base,\u201d says Bill Proudman, CEO of\ndiversity consulting firm White Men As Full Diversity Partners (WMFDP).\n\nTaking a DI stance on recruitment was one of the first efforts started albeit\nto score brownie points as an employer brand. Whatever the motivation might\nhave been, it was a much-needed journey to start and one that will hopefully\nonly pick up the pace till diversity becomes an organic part and parcel of any\norganization. Jill Strange, VP of Science Applications of Infor HCM warns,\n\u201cWhile candidate assessment is not a new concept, using AI to help speed up\nthe recruiting process is still in its nascent phases. As more companies\ncontinue to bet big on AI to help them overcome unconscious biases, it is\ncrucial that HR leaders work with AI throughout the hiring process, rather\nthan relying on it to solve institutional bias,\u201d\n\nWith diversity, despite the multiple strings of conversation around the topic,\nthe process has been relatively slow since stereotyping, being prejudiced and\nexercising bias are all thought and behavior patterns that are evolutionarily\nentrenched in us. That said, the trend is surely on the rise and with\ntechnology adding more impetus to it, the coming decade could hope to see the\nmomentum picking up as newer demographic compositions start working together.\n\n**Learn more:[What is Talent Pipeline? Definition, Management with\nExamples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-talent-pipeline/)**\n\nWhile these are the key trends we see growing to impact the workplace in the\ncoming decade, the world of work is a dynamic macrocosm where even the\nsmallest changes, lead to big differences and subsequent trend waves. However,\nwhat organizations need to ask themselves is whether they are happy playing\ncatch-up or ready to lead change.\n\n**_What are your thoughts on the future of work?

Work design\nrefers to the nature and organization of tasks, activities, and\nresponsibilities within a job or [work\nrole](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-\npsych-010213-115208) _._ From a psychological perspective, when work is well-\ndesigned, workers have interesting tasks, autonomy over those tasks, a\nmeaningful degree of social contact with others and a tolerable level of task\ndemands: reasonable workloads, clear responsibilities and manageable emotional\npressures.\n\nFor employees, the [benefits](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-06118-001)\nof well-designed work include job satisfaction, engagement, improved home-work\nbalance, lower job stress, better well-being and an overall sense of purpose.\nFor companies, good work design means opportunities to fully harness and\ncultivate talent by providing more [job\nautonomy](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-04925-009), one of the strongest\ndrivers of employee creativity,\n[proactivity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16737360) and innovation.\nBut when work is poorly designed, the opposite is true. Jobs can become\nintolerable and demotivating\u2014particularly jobs in which the tasks are\nrepetitive and tightly controlled, or jobs in which the level of demand\noverwhelms people.\n\nDespite the benefits of well-designed work, poor work design abounds in many\ncompanies. Why? The typical answer focuses on macro-level forces such as the\n[decline in\nunions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314258855_Work_Design_Influences_A_Synthesis_of_Multilevel_Factors_that_Affect_the_Design_of_Jobs)\nand inadequate national labor laws. While we agree that large-scale variables\nare important, our research shows that they do not explain the whole story.\n\n **Study #1 : Managers Often Make Boring Jobs More Boring**\n\nTo discover why poor work design continues to be so prominent in organizations\naround the world, we conducted [a\nstudy](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-01471-001) to understand how people\nthink about and develop roles for others. An [earlier\nstudy](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01126707) shows that, when\nasked to design jobs, management students at the university level tend to\ncreate roles with highly repetitive and boring work due to a belief that such\nwork is more efficient. Our goal was to see if this finding applies to\nmanagers and professionals as well.\n\nWe invited managers and professionals from human-services industries\n(organizational psychologists, safety managers, health and safety inspectors)\nto participate in two online simulations. In the first simulation,\nparticipants had to design a job. They were presented with a half-time\nclerical job made up entirely of photocopying and filing tasks. We then asked\nthem to make it a full-time job by selecting additional tasks from a list and\nadding them to the current role. Participants could make the job extremely\nrepetitive by adding even more photocopying and filing tasks, or they could\nmake the job more meaningful and interesting by adding tasks such as greeting\nvisitors or helping with a quality improvement project. They were told that\nall the tasks were relevant, that the clerk was capable of doing them all, and\nthat the job would be a permanent one.\n\nA surprising finding (especially given that we deliberately focused on human\nservice managers and professionals) was that almost half (45%) of the\nparticipants designed the job to be even more boring, composed of doing almost\nentirely photocopying and filing tasks, eight hours a day.\n\n **Study #2 : Managers Would Often Rather \"Fix the Worker\" Than Change the\nWork Design**\n\nNext, we asked participants to imagine that they were the manager in various\nscenarios involving workforce problems. As an example, we told participants\nthey managed a warehouse worker (Karen) who was failing to meet 50% of her\ndeadlines. For each scenario, we made it clear the work design was poor. In\nKaren's case, we stated that she \"moves quickly\" and \"often runs\" to pick up\ngoods, but still can't pick them off the shelves on time. Participants then\nrated how effective they believed various strategies would be to address these\nproblems. Some strategies focused on 'fixing the poor work design' and some\nfocused on 'fixing the worker'.\n\nEven though quite a few participants chose strategies to fix the poor work\ndesign (such as \"redesign the work so the tasks don't need to be timed\"), a\nsurprising number of participants still opted to 'fix the worker.' For\nexample, despite knowing that Karen often had to run to meet her times, more\nthan two-thirds of participants said they would \"send Karen on training\";\nalmost one third chose to \"advise Karen to improve her physical fitness\"; and\nnearly one quarter opted to \"threaten to reduce Karen's pay if she doesn't\nimprove her times.\" Each of these strategies indirectly \"blames\" the worker\nwhen poor work design is the more fundamental issue.\n\nHow Can Organizations Help?\n\nManagers and professionals are in an excellent position to create meaningful,\nmotivating and stress-free work for their employees. But our research suggests\nthat many will not do so\u2014they have a natural tendency to design poor work for\nothers. Many professionals are also inclined to blame the worker when there\nare performance issues, rather than change the inadequate work design.\nFortunately, organizations can learn from [our\nresearch](https://www.transformativeworkdesign.com/research-streams), and take\nsteps to improve the situation.\n\n **Recognize the importance of well-designed work \u2014 from all perspectives**.\nImproving work design from a psychological perspective is not on the radar for\nmany companies. Work design is usually considered from a process perspective\nonly (such as introducing lean principles), or from a physical work space\nperspective (such as open plan offices). But by ignoring the psychology behind\ntruly good work design, organizations risk disengaging their workers,\naccelerating turnover and driving down productivity. Indeed, there is little\npoint in having a funky office that is meant to spark innovation, while having\nbosses who tightly control all aspects of the work.\n\n **Train managers and other relevant professionals.** Leadership teams have an\nimportant role to play when it comes to designing quality work. Through their\nown actions, managers can allow people more autonomy over decisions, ensure\nthat tasks are various, and provide staff with support when demands are high.\nHowever, our research shows that these skills don't come naturally for most,\neven those who work in the human services field. In fact, our findings suggest\nthat people with high conservation life values (that is, those who attach high\nimportance to security, conformity and tradition) value narrow, repetitive\nwork the most, design the worst jobs, and may need additional support and\ntraining. Without educating the people responsible for assigning work, poor\nwork design will continue in many work places.\n\n **Beware of self-perpetuating cycles.** In our study, the worst job designers\nlacked autonomy in their own careers, suggesting that people unconsciously\nmimic their work designs when designing work for others. This means that\norganizations with a hierarchical command-and-control model present a unique\nchallenge for managers looking to shift to a more autonomous model. To avoid a\nvicious cycle in which bad work is perpetuated, good work design needs to\nstart at the top. Managers who experience the value of well-designed work are\nmore likely to create it for others.\n\n **Discuss work design in performance reviews.** When a worker behaves in a\nway that is not ideal (being absent, missing deadlines or failing to\ninnovate), the cause can be poor work design. But our research shows that\nmanagers often prefer to 'fix the worker' \u2014  sending them off to training\nprograms or removing their bonuses. We believe that including work design in\nperformance review discussions will allow managers to more easily identify how\nbig, or how little, a role it plays in employee performance. For instance,\nwhen an employee is not being innovative, rather than assuming the person\n\"isn't up to it or needs training,\" managers should check to make sure the job\nhas enough autonomy to motivate and inspire creativity.\n\n **Involve experts where necessary.** Our study found that leaders with\nspecific training and expertise in work design (that is, organizational\npsychologists) designed more meaningful work. In some cases, particularly\nthose in which improving work design requires a system-level change, a deeper\nlevel of expertise is beneficial. Organizational psychology is one of the\n[fastest growing\nprofessions](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/americas-20-fastest-growing-jobs-\nsurprise/story?id=22364716) in the U.S., with [scholars in this\nfield](https://thinkers50.com/) making an increasingly important mark on the\nbusiness world. We encourage organizations to draw on this form of expertise,\nand related forms, if poor work design is entrenched in their organization.\n\nEconomically and socially, well-designed work pays off. We need to build\nbetter work for people, and this need is a timely one. While offering promise\nand productivity, the digital era also brings with it [potential\nthreats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28182465) to the quality of\npeople's work design. We see this at Amazon, where technology is used to\nmonitor people's movements and to impose excessive control over their actions.\nIn addition, there is [vast\nevidence](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27478453_Designing_Healthy_Work)\nthat well-designed work helps prevent the emergence of mental health issues.\nNow more than ever, we need a better understanding of which work designs are\noptimal and how to achieve them.  \n\n[ _Sharon K.\nParker_](https://hbr.org/search?term=sharon%20k.%20parker&search_type=search-\nall) _is an Australian Research Council Laureate Fellow, a Professor of\nManagement at Curtin University in Perth, and Director of the Centre for\nTransformative Work Design._[ _Daniela\nAndrei_](https://hbr.org/search?term=daniela%20andrei&search_type=search-all)\n_is a Research Fellow at the Centre for Transformative Work Design, Future of\nWork Institute, Curtin University.

HR deals with building,\nmaintaining, and improving human relationships in organization. The constant\nneed for human touch in each of the HR processes make way for the\nimplementation of AI. AI is revolutionizing how recruitments are done,\ntraining is imparted, and data is used to derive people\n[analytics](https://aithority.com//?s=analytics). It is helping HR\nprofessionals smartly automate repetitive actions while allowing them with the\nbandwidth to focus on more strategic tasks that need human intervention.\n\n\u201cAI is an accelerator \u2013 it allows us the ability to ingest a variety of data\nand provide context to a decision-maker or employee or business leader. It\nallows us to deliver the right intelligence in the moment and achieve\nPersonalization at scale.\u201d [Tom Stachura](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-\nstachura-3842308/), Vice President Talent Solutions & People Analytics,\n[IBM](https://aithority.com//?s=IBM).\n\n#####  **Some Interesting Stats:**\n\n[Gartner](https://aithority.com//?s=Gartner) reported in 2017 that [AI will\nautomate 1.8 million people out of work by\n2020](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/top-trends-in-the-gartner-\nhype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-2017/). While most people made a fuss\nabout the number of jobs lost due to automation, they failed to note the point\nthat the same report also mentioned that AI will help create 2.3 million jobs\nby the same year. That\u2019s an addition of 500,000 new jobs.\n\nA [study by\nMcKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Digital%20Disruption/Harnessing%20automation%20for%20a%20future%20that%20works/MGI-\nA-future-that-works_Full-report.ashx) in 2017 revealed that just 5% of US jobs\ncould be automated fully, and that around 60% could be partially automated.\nThe point is, AI is not going to eliminate the human workforce. Of course,\nmany tasks will be automated and many will get redundant, but a future-ready\nworkforce will thrive in the end. The human intervention will always be\nrequired at the end of the funnel. Human work is only going to be more\nproductive with the assistance of AI.\n\nNow that AI has already made its way into the [HR technology\n](https://aithority.com//?s=HR)space, let\u2019s see how it is reinventing HR Tech\nfor good.\n\n _ **Read More:**_[ _Cybercrime Damage Expected to Hit $6 Trillion Mark\nAnnually by 2021_](https://aithority.com/ait-featured-posts/cybercrime-damage-\nexpected-to-hit-6-trillion-mark-annually-by-2021/)\n\n####  **5 Ways Artificial Intelligence is Reinventing HR Tech**\n\n#####  **1\\. Cognitive-supporting Decision-making**\n\nIBM surveyed around 6000 executives in 2017 and came out with the report\n\u201c[Extending expertise: How cognitive computing is transforming HR and the\nemployee experience](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/QVPR1K7D).\u201d An\nimportant pick from the study was that 66% of CEOs believed that [cognitive\ncomputing](https://aithority.com//?s=cognitive+computing) could drive\nsignificant value in HR. More than 50% of HR executives seconded with this.\n54% of them believed that cognitive computing will influence key HR roles.\n\nIBM proved the point by demonstrating how cognitive engines could actually\nhelp professionals arrive at key day-to-day decisions in the organization\neasily. Tasks such as determining the mood of an employee before and after a\nclient call can be assessed and it could be decided if s/he needs a break or\nis fine to continue. AI could also help detect anxiety in the tone of the\nemployee for the employers to look into the depth of the matter and resolve it\nbefore it harms the well-being of the staff or the organization. This is just\none example; Human Resources can utilize similar capabilities to take care of\na lot more such aspects.\n\nCompanies have been collecting customer and [employee\ndata](https://aithority.com//?s=employee+data%C2%A0) for many years. But even\nthough they have understood what to make of customer data to quite an extent,\nit\u2019s not the same with employee data. With [customer\ndata](https://aithority.com//?s=customer+data), organizations can understand\ntrends, gain insights, and predict future consumer behaviors. But sadly, HR\nteams are still in a fix as to what to track and how to use the information to\narrive at insights. AI will help gather insightful data for the HR departments\nto make data-driven, intelligent decisions.\n\n#####  **2\\. Enhancing the Recruitment Process and Time-to-hire**\n\nWe are still very far from the goal of making the entire recruitment process\ndevoid of human touch. But Artificial Intelligence has gone a long way towards\nmaking the process faster and simpler and no one is even thinking of\ncompletely automating the recruiting cycle.\n\n52% of recruiters say [screening candidates from a large applicant pool is the\ntoughest part of recruitment](https://ideal.com/ai-recruiting/). An AI-enabled\nprogram comes in handy when the recruiters and HR professionals need to go\nthrough and filter candidates out from a stack of hundreds and thousands of\nresumes. Recruiters can make use of AI to carry out labor market analysis,\nskills matching, competency identification, and bias detection in job\ndescriptions. AI will keep biases from entering the hiring process at any\ninstance. Furthermore, HR executives can use\n[chatbots](https://aithority.com//?s=chatbots) to communicate with candidates\nbefore scheduling interviews and provide answers to their common queries. This\ncuts down a lot of time and efforts and reduces time-to-hire.\n\nThe introduction of AI in the recruitment process has positively affected the\ncandidate experience and recruiter efficiency at the same time.\n\n#####  **3\\. More Efficient Training and Development**\n\nAny organization needs to keep its workforce updated with the latest skills\nand expertise in order to thrive in the ever-changing digital landscape. With\nAI by the side, training and development methodologies have modernized\nconsiderably.\n\nCompanies can employ AI in conjunction with [AR](https://aithority.com//?s=AR)\nand [VR](https://aithority.com//?s=VR) to train their staff and stay ahead of\nthe competition. HR teams can personalize training content as per the\nindividual requirements of the employees. This is a win-win situation for both\nthe employees and the organizations which further contributes to positive\nemployee experience and job satisfaction.\n\n ** _Read More:_**[ _5 Ways Artificial Intelligence Brings Diversity to the\nModern Workplace_](http://aithority.com/guest-authors/5-ways-artificial-\nintelligence-brings-diversity-to-the-modern-workplace/)\n\n#####  **4\\. Voice of the Employee Analytics**\n\nGartner says Voice of [Employee (VoE) analytics is going to be a key area that\nwill interest modern HR](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-\nreleases/2019-06-19-gartner-identifies-three-most-common-ai-use-cases-in-?)\ndepartments. HR leaders from across the globe want to improve the way they\nmonitor employee engagement. For instance, companies can analyze survey data,\nor social media behavior of its employees to check their positive or negative\nsentiments towards certain aspects of their workplaces. For instance, if\nemployees are talking about long working hours, companies can take necessary\nmeasures to look into this and prevent employees from further developing\nnegative emotions because of this.\n\nSo, other than getting information from surveys, firms can utilize several\nother communication channels too. [VoE\nplatforms](https://aithority.com//?s=VoE+platforms) use AI technologies that\nemploy a variety of [NLP](https://aithority.com//?s=NLP) (Natural Language\nProcessing) and textual analysis techniques to study sentiment and get\ninsights from text-based answers. This is going to be a major tool for HR\ndepartments in the days to come.\n\n#####  **5\\. Employee Retention**\n\nArtificial Intelligence has the capability to completely transform how the HR\ndepartment functions. Whether it is about recruiting, employee engagement,\ncommunication, talent management, benefits assessment, training and learning,\nAI is making a mark everywhere.\n\nIn addition, AI can also assist with employee retention. It can detect the\npossibilities of employees leaving the firm by checking information related to\npay-scale, employee experience, attrition rate, time in role, performance,\netc. It can understand from their browsing patterns, outgoing e-mails, and\nkeystrokes if they are looking out for opportunities. This makes way for HR\nteams to look into the possible causes of employees leaving, and take\npreventive measures to avoid that happening. [Employee retention is a problem\nfor 57% of companies](https://empxtrack.com/blog/statistics-for-human-\nresource-management/), and implementing AI in their HR functions would surely\nhelp the cause to a great extent.\n\nWhile AI will cut the mundane tasks out of the HR operations, more and more\ntech-savvy professionals would be needed to supervise the acts. AI systems may\nbe good enough to carry out the tasks, but they would not be able to think\noutside of the box and make intelligent decisions.\n\n ** _Read More:_**[ _Amazon Brings AI Performance to the Cloud with NVIDIA T4\nGPUs_](https://aithority.com/computing/amazon-brings-ai-performance-to-the-\ncloud-with-nvidia-t4-gpus/)\n\nThat\u2019s where the **_Human_** in Human Resources will reign supreme.\n\n[AI](https://www.aithority.com/tag/ai/)\n[AR](https://www.aithority.com/tag/ar/)\n[chatbots](https://www.aithority.com/tag/chatbots/) [Cognitive\nComputing](https://www.aithority.com/tag/cognitive-computing/) [HR\nTechnology](https://www.aithority.com/tag/hr-technology/)\n[IBM](https://www.aithority.com/tag/ibm/)\n[news](https://www.aithority.com/tag/news/) 2019-09-30\n\n**[AIT Staff Writer](https://www.aithority.com/author/ait-staff-writer/ \"Posts\nby AIT Staff Writer\") **\n\nTags [AI](https://www.aithority.com/tag/ai/)\n[AR](https://www.aithority.com/tag/ar/)\n[chatbots](https://www.aithority.com/tag/chatbots/) [Cognitive\nComputing](https://www.aithority.com/tag/cognitive-computing/) [HR\nTechnology](https://www.aithority.com/tag/hr-technology/)\n[IBM](https://www.aithority.com/tag/ibm/)\n[news](https://www.aithority.com/tag/news/)\n\n[__ Twitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=https://www.aithority.com/ait-\nfeatured-posts/5-ways-artificial-intelligence-is-reinventing-hr-technology/\n\"5+Ways+Artificial+Intelligence+is+Reinventing+HR+Technology\") [__\nFacebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.aithority.com/ait-\nfeatured-posts/5-ways-artificial-intelligence-is-reinventing-hr-technology/)\n[__ Google\n+](https://plusone.google.com/_/+1/confirm?hl=en&url=https://www.aithority.com/ait-\nfeatured-posts/5-ways-artificial-intelligence-is-reinventing-hr-technology/)\n[__\nlinkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.aithority.com/ait-\nfeatured-posts/5-ways-artificial-intelligence-is-reinventing-hr-technology/ \"5\nWays Artificial Intelligence is Reinventing HR Technology\") More\n\n###  Authors\n\n![AIT Staff Writer](https://www.aithority.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/Staff-Writer-180-x-180-150x150.jpg)\n\nPosted by : [AIT Staff Writer](https://www.aithority.com/author/ait-staff-\nwriter/ \"Posts by AIT Staff Writer\")\n\nAiT Staff Writer is a trained content marketing professional with multiple\nyears of experience in journalism and technology blogging.

This year, 70 percent of\nrespondents to the Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends Survey cited\nrecruitment as an important issue, and 16 percent highlighted it was one of\nthe three most urgent issues their organization is likely to face in 20191.\nThis is rightly so, as in the age of the knowledge economy and changing\nworkforce dynamics, hiring the right people at the right time can be the\ndifference between a successful enterprise and a failed one.\n\nIn the fast-paced scenario, it is important to find the right fit for a role\nfrom a saturated labor pool quickly. Due to the record low unemployment rates\nin the developed world, the pool of qualified candidates to choose from has\nshrunk. For example, China\u2019s unemployment rate was 3.8 percent in Q4, 2018.\nFurther, the demand for technical skills combined with managerial prowess is a\nunique skill set which not many in the labor market possess. Around 60 percent\nof the respondents to the Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends Survey feel\nthat the biggest challenge in recruitment is \u2018finding qualified experienced\nhires\u2019.\n\nThe war for talent is raging more fiercely than ever. Winning the battle\nrequires more than execution; it demands reinvention not just of the talent\nacquisition process, but of the talent acquisition mindset\n\nIt is in this context, that technology has the potential to become a driver of\ntransformation in hiring practices across businesses.\n\n### The unutilized talent pool\n\nBroadly, the traditional talent pool can be classified into internal hires and\nexternal hires. When we talk about recruiting, the focus of most companies is\non finding the right person from outside the organization. There are head-\nhunters, job posting websites, intermediaries, etc. to which companies often\nend up paying huge fees and yet end up hiring sub-optimal talent.\n\nCompanies often overlook the internal talent pool. Research has shown that it\ncosts 1/6th to retrain an internal resource than hiring an external talent1.\nThe DHCTS also shows that 56 percent of the respondents believe that it is\neasier to find a job outside the organization than inside. The question then\nis, how can we leverage technology to encourage internal hiring?\n\n### Alternate workforce: The talent pool of tomorrow\n\nContingent workers and other non-traditional arrangements form the alternate\nworkforce. This tactic of working is gaining popularity not just among\ncompanies, but also amongst workers. This provides companies the flexibility\nthey want in managing their balance sheets and meeting the legal requirements\nand provides workers the flexibility with their timing and workload. However,\nhow do companies access this labor pool of the future, is the biggest\nquestion. Perhaps it is one that can be answered through technology.\n\n### Leveraging technology for the talent pools\n\nPerhaps the single biggest change in the recruitment scenario has been brought\nin through the advent of data analytics, machine learning and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI). Companies are leveraging these technologies to make hiring\nmore scientific and accurate. However, in spite of this recognition, the\nDeloitte study has found that only six percent of respondents believe that\nthey utilize best in class processes and technologies.\n\nIn this scenario, it is pertinent to have a look at some ways in which\nrecruitment is being changed by technology:\n\n  * **Screening of candidates:** Gone are the days when companies used applicant tracking systems to help catalog employees. Now technology exists which makes the screening process more scientific, robust and scalable. For example, there are tools in the market which use publicly available information about a candidate to create a profile of the candidate which can then be mapped to relevant roles in the organization. Many HR Tech Startups with AI-based chatbots, claim to reduce the time taken to screen candidates by 30-50 percent. This time can be spent on other critical hiring processes like interviews, and bringing the \u201chumane\u201d element back into recruitment. \n  * **Conducting Interviews:** Video interviews are being used to screen candidates and to assign them to roles that are the best fit for them. A few tools can be used not just to identify coding prowess of future employees, but it also offers a tool for online interviewing1.\n  * **Internal Hiring:** The most overlooked component of hiring can be greatly reformed by technology. Often, companies are unaware of the talent pool inside the organization. In this scenario, an AI-based assessment system can help organizations in mapping the competencies of their employees and find the right fit for roles from within. One of the largest global consumer goods organization has already used such tools for hiring external candidates who may not have college degrees but may be well suited for specific roles. Organizations should consider making AI-enabled competency mapping for employees a must so that they find the right talent in-house and cut down the time and cost of on-boarding of employees.\n  * **Tapping the alternate workforce:** Use of job networks can help companies tap into talented employees who want to return to work but maybe not on a full-time basis. Similarly, talent network sites provide access to a wide talent pool that prefers alternate work arrangements. Companies need to consider tapping into these networks to hire workers on a short-term basis to complete non-critical tasks. Companies would need to use tech solutions to tap into these networks, screen the right person and get them working immediately. \n\nRecruiting must accept new technologies and capitalize on these capabilities\nto hire the right people and reduce the cost of hiring for the company.\nCompanies must figure out a way to tap into the alternate workforce so that\nthey can leverage the talent pool that exists in the gig economy.\n\n> The single biggest change in the recruitment scenario has been brought in\n> through the advent of data analytics, machine learning and Artificial\n> Intelligence; however, study finds that only six percent of respondents\n> believe that they utilize best in class processes and technologies\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn today\u2019s world of changing jobs and skills, organizations have an\nopportunity to take a fresh look at how they approach talent acquisition,\nexploring new approaches to determining what talent they need\u2014and where and\nhow to find it. The war for talent is raging more fiercely than ever. To win\nrequires more than execution; it demands reinvention\u2014not just of the talent\nacquisition process, but of the talent acquisition mindset. To do this,\norganizations would need to rethink how to access existing internal talent,\nreset traditional expectations on where talent can be found and what it looks\nlike, and rewire the recruiting process by taking advantage of advanced\ntechnologies like AI. The talent is out there if you know how to look.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Talent

That's what's so important about\nwhat we do. Our voice is powerful.\"\n\nDickens was speaking during a mega session June 23 at the SHRM 2019 Annual\nConference & Exposition. She moderated a panel discussion with federal agency\nleaders on how HR professionals can make a meaningful impact on critical\nissues in the world of work.\n\nConference attendee Angelia Washington, SHRM-SCP, said she was interested in\nunderstanding how SHRM and HR professionals are helping to shape policies. She\nworks for Elkhart Housing Authority in Indiana and is earning a master's\ndegree in social work.\n\nOne critical issue on HR's radar is how to close the skills gap. Eighty-three\npercent of HR professionals who responded to [a 2018 SHRM survey](/hr-\ntoday/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-\nsurveys/Documents/SHRM%20It%27s%20All%20About%20Talent%20Infographic.pdf) said\nthey had difficulty recruiting suitable job candidates in the prior year.\nSeventy-five percent of respondents said there's a skills shortage among\ncandidates and 52 percent felt that the skills gap had worsened in the last\ntwo years.\n\nSo what can HR professionals and government leaders do to help close the\nskills gap? Here are three ideas panelists shared.  \n\n1\\. Support Multiple Training Pathways  \n\nHR specialists need to be part of the conversation to help prepare people for\ncareer paths and eliminate the gap, said Scott Stump, assistant secretary for\ncareer, technical and adult education at the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nThere's a fundamental discontent between education and economy, Stump noted.\nFor several decades, high-school graduates and job seekers have been pushed\ntoward earning a four-year degree, he said. \"But we've neglected multiple\npathways.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is exploring ways to get people off the\nsidelines of the labor force and involved in the mainstream, said Jonathan\nBerry, the DOL's acting assistant secretary for policy. The government needs\nto develop programs that ensure people are provided paths to sustainable\ncareers and are getting the training and education they need to participate\nfully in the workforce, he said, noting that those programs can involve\napprenticeships, on-the-job training or a traditional college education.\n\nBerry supports [industry-led apprenticeship programs](/resourcesandtools/hr-\ntopics/talent-acquisition/pages/dol-supports-industry-certified-\napprenticeship-programs.aspx) that put that responsibility on industry experts\nto develop the programs. The federal government can be in the background\nmaking sure programs meet certain standards. The White House regulatory office\nrecently concluded its review of a draft for the apprenticeship program, he\nsaid, \"so stay tuned.\"\n\n2\\. Hire Older Workers\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) focuses on eliminating\nemployment discrimination, but the agency also wants to ensure that more\npeople get recruited into the workplace, said Victoria Lipnic, an EEOC\ncommissioner. The economy is much better now than it was during the Great\nRecession of the late 2000s, but many older workers are still on the\nsidelines, she said, noting that she prefers the term \"experienced\" workers to\n\"older\" workers.\n\nForty-nine percent of respondents to a 2019 survey by NORC at the University\nof Chicago who experienced age-related discrimination said it happened during\nthe job application process.\n\nDespite the booming economy, workers ages 50 and older experience longer terms\nof unemployment after a layoff than their younger colleagues, Lipnic noted.\n\n\"People live longer and need to work longer,\" she said. So HR professionals\nshould think about how they are recruiting and how to reach a more diverse\npool of candidates. \"Everyone has to broaden their approach,\" she added.\n\n3\\. Hire Formerly Incarcerated Workers  \n\nThe EEOC's most recent guidance on using criminal background information to\nmake employment decisions was released in 2012. The guidance recognizes that\nrelying on arrest and conviction records may have a disparate impact on\napplicants based on race and national origin. Among other requirements,\nemployers were instructed to conduct [an \"individualized\nassessment\"](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/talent-\nacquisition/pages/individualized-assessments-background-checks.aspx) allowing\ncandidates to provide evidence that a conviction is not related to their\nability to perform a job.\n\nThe guidance was pretty controversial when it was released, but attitudes have\nshifted since 2012, Lipnic said.\n\nEighty-two percent of managers surveyed by NORC and 67 percent of [HR\nprofessionals surveyed](/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-\nsurveys/pages/second-chances.aspx) by SHRM in 2018 felt that the quality of\nhire for workers with criminal records was as high as or higher than that for\nworkers without records.\n\nSHRM encourages employers to give opportunities to qualified job applicants\nwith criminal backgrounds and has partnered with Koch Industries to launch the\n[Getting Talent Back to Work](https://www.gettingtalentbacktowork.org/)\ninitiative.\n\n\"The employment of people with criminal records is an issue workplaces should\nbe talking about,\" said Johnny C.
