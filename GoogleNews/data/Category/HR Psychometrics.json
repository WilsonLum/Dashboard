across sixteen geographies has identified the four most important\nglobal HR and human capital trends for 2020 and 2021._  \n\nAccording to the research by [Mercer](/firms/mercer \"Mercer\"), the four top\ntrends have already increasingly been shaping the face of the human resources\nlandscape for a number of years, but these are now accelerating in importance\namid the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on economy and society. \"The trends\nare ramping up changes in the way organisations globally are working and will\ncontinue to work into the future,\" stated the report.\n\n## **ESG and Purpose**\n\nWith a new, more responsible mandate emerging, the challenge for business is\nto rethink what makes corporations successful. Although 85% of executives\nagree that the organisation's purpose should extend beyond shareholder\nprimacy, only 35% deliver on a multi-stakeholder model today.\n\nThe majority of the C-suite agrees more needs to be done: 68% of executives\nwant to accelerate progress on environmental, social and governance (ESG)\nmetrics in 2020, and 69% believe HR should update its success models to\nreflect the experience economy. However, with responsibility for many ESG\nmetrics and culture change outcomes sitting primarily with HR (71% of CHROs\nshoulder the responsibility for culture change, compared with between 16% and\n29% of other executives), more shared responsibility is required.\n\n![The top HR and human capital\ntrends](/illustrations/news/detail/2020-03-28-115806555-The-top-HR-and-human-\ncapital-trends.jpg)\n\nMuch of an organisation's success depends on employees trusting that their\ncompany is taking a holistic view of their careers, wealth and well-being. Yet\ncareer pipelines have tightened in recent years. As many as 72% of older\nworkers say they plan to work past retirement age and 55% of Gen X say\nlongevity in the workplace is limiting progression. Gen Z also want more\ntransparency on the effect of career choices and the long-term outlook.\n\nAn intriguing finding of the 2020 HR Trends report is that employees who know\nthe lifespan of their skills feel more positive about the future. Employees\nwhose companies are transparent about which jobs will change are more likely\nto be thriving (72% versus 56%).\n\nAs the Covid-19 pandemic impacts productivity, better management of older\nworkers and good financial advice for all generations will be part of creating\nshared value. More than three-quarters (78%) of employees want long-term\nfinancial planning initiatives. Meanwhile 75% of employees who feel in control\nof designing their retirement say they are thriving, compared with 29% who\nlack the control they desire.\n\nYet, with just 23% of companies providing financial education for employees\ntoday, there is a long way to go. Pandemic-driven disruption demands that\norganisations urgently rethink financial support and ensure that decisions\ninclude both economic and empathetic considerations (a balance that only 37%\nof employees say their company is currently well equipped to do).\n\n## **Building and adapting skills**\n\nWith 99% of organisations saying they want to embark on transformation in\n2020, and almost all reporting significant skills gaps, the C-suite regards\nreskilling as the top talent investment capable of driving business success.\nWorkforce capability and lack of future skills are seen as primary reasons why\ntransformations fail, and reskilling is one of the investments they hope to\nmaintain in a downturn. Just 28% identified cutting back on reskilling\ninitiatives as a tactic to mitigate economic softening.\n\nEmployees also see reskilling as an emerging part of the deal (rising in\nimportance as an attraction and a retention driver this year). And although\nmore than three-quarters of employees say they are ready to learn new skills,\ntwo in five say they lack the time to take advantage of reskilling. In this\nrespect the Covid-19 pandemic may offer the opportunity required to kick-start\nreskilling. Some business areas will have more time to spare, and firms can\ntake advantage by directing those employees toward online learning courses and\ncareer exploration.\n\nHowever, just 34% of HR leaders are investing in workforce learning and\nreskilling as part of their future of work strategy. Moreover, 40% of HR\nleaders do not know what skills their workforce possesses. This can be\nregarded as a worrying lack of insight, given executives' gut feeling that\nless than half (45%) of their workers are capable of adapting to the future of\nwork.\n\nWithout redesigning roles and career options for those at risk of\ndisplacement, HR cannot address firm-wide needs to fill new roles with\nreskilled internal talent. The concern is that without an integrated approach\nto strategic workforce planning (which takes account of how skills may change)\nand limited data on existing skills, companies may inadvertently lose valued\ntalent. Long-term planning would enable firms to imagine brighter futures for\ntheir employees and boost their competitiveness once economic conditions\nimprove.\n\n## **Data science**\n\nThe good news is that the workforce science discipline is gathering momentum.\nThe use of predictive analytics has nearly quadrupled in five years, from 10%\nin 2016 to 39% today, and the use of metrics on pay inequities and total\nrewards usage has more than doubled.\n\nThat said, insights into workforce management could be adopted more widely.\nOnly 43% of organisations use metrics to identify employees likely to leave,\n18% know the impact of pay strategies on performance, and just 12% use\nanalytics to correct inequities and prevent them from recurring. Moreover, in\nthe current disruption are companies looking in the right places to ensure\nsustainability? Only 24% have data on who is at risk of burnout and only 15%\ncan determine whether it is better to buy/build/ borrow employees.\n\nThe next wave of maturity requires HR to lean in to structure analytics such\nthat it can answer key strategic questions, like: In a downturn, which\nstrategy offers the best chance of maintaining performance? Which departments\ncould deliver a similar level of output with more contingent staff? Where\nshould we locate talent hubs to take advantage of skilled talent pools?\n\nIn parallel, advances in machine learning continue to filter through\ndepartments, including HR. Although machines outperform humans at tasks\nrelated to scale and speed, humans still outpace machines in sense-checking\nand judgment Sixty-seven percent of HR leaders are confident they can ensure\nAI is not institutionalising bias. However, ethics codes about the collection,\napplication and implications of data analytics are still in their infancy.\n\nTalent assessment is an area where human intuition is needed alongside\npsychometrics to qualify findings. Today, only one in two employees have a\npositive assessment experience. This is just one example of data collection\nthat will attract more scrutiny as data-informed decision-making becomes\ncommon. Leading companies are on the front foot sharing data-driven insights\nwith employees to help them make health, wealth and career decisions: 38% of\norganisations today apply intelligent \"nudging\" technology to help employees\nmake better choices. Further, exploring relevant metrics and sharing them with\nemployees shows how the new climate of remote working affects productivity.\n\n## **Employee experience**\n\nDelivering on the employee experience is a top priority for HR in 2020. Fifty-\neight percent of organisations are redesigning their structures to become more\npeople-centric. Yet only 27% of the C-suite believe their investment in the\nemployee experience will yield a business return. Why? Because executives are\nyet to be convinced of the link between the employee experience and\nproductivity.\n\nAlmost half (48%) of executives rank employees' well-being as a top workforce\nconcern, but only 29% of HR leaders have a health and well-being strategy.\nFeeling depleted is a worrying trend (particularly for employees in Japan and\nthe UK), and two-thirds of employees globally feel at risk of burnout in the\nyear ahead. Burnout risk will only be exacerbated as employees now balance\nwork with social distancing, remote working, closures and quarantines.\n\nThe Mercer study shows that action is vital, given that energised employees\nare four times more likely to report a healthy, flexible and inclusive\nworkplace. Employees who are energised by their job are essential to\ntransformation agendas: Energised employees say they are more likely to stay,\nmore resilient and more ready to reskill. Energised employees work in cultures\nthat are empathetic, in environments they find enriching, and in work cultures\nthat are both efficient and embracing.\n\nSeamless interactions and better enablement of digital working in times of\nsocial distancing have a clear role to play, yet only two in five companies\nsay they are mostly or fully digital, the same proportion as in 2018. This\nwill remain a C-suite priority.\n\nFocusing on the desired interactions between HR and the business is key to\nunlocking energy and enhancing the employee experience. Delivering on this\naspiration requires HR to step out of its traditional functional silos.\nDespite the benefits associated with a more joined up approach, just 40% of HR\nleaders say they have an integrated people strategy today.\n\nThe good news is that 50% of HR respondents have moved away from traditional\nstructures to meet their businesses' escalating need for agility and 26% say\nthey have built a fluid team to respond to different business priorities.\nGrappling with stability and agility will be a key theme in 2020.\n\n## **Summary**\n\nAccording to Mercer's 2020 Global Talent Trends study, the talent landscape\nwill be disrupted in the coming years as jobs are replaced, new skills enter\nthe labour market and the demands of workers changes. As employers transform\nto tackle these matters, they should reconsider their company's purpose and\ntheir responsibilities to employees and employees' future earnings. And, they\nneed to do so while facing unforeseen challenges like the current coronavirus.\n\n  * [ __](mailto:?&subject=The top HR and human capital trends for 2020 and

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Innovation](/innovation)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nMahe Bayireddi\n\nMahe Bayireddi is CEO of [Phenom People](http://www.phenompeople.com/), a\nglobal HR technology company with a mission to help a billion people find the\nright job.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nIt only takes  [a tenth of a\nsecond](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/how-many-seconds-to-a-\nfirst-impression) to form an impression of a stranger. For HR bringing in new\nemployees, however, that doesn\u2019t exactly provide enough time to eliminate\nsubconscious bias and determine if someone is the right fit for a job.\n\nSo how can organizations make unbiased, more science-based predictions about\nwho is the best fit for a position, team or particular business challenge?\nRight now psychologists are getting closer to that answer through the study of\npersonality, cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Now that we can work with\nbigger data sets and artificial intelligence (AI), we can make more accurate\npredictions about the perfect fit through the use of validated psychometric\nassessments.\n\n**What Are Psychometric Assessments?**\n\nThese new assessments ask questions based on dimensions that predict what kind\nof person you are -- factors such as your work style, cognitive ability and\naptitude (many skills that can be difficult or impossible to identify during\ninterviews). This might not be a new idea, but the [latest psychometric\nassessments](http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2019-06-05/business-\nnews/75-of-Fortune-500-companies-use-psychometric-testing-in-\nrecruitment-6736209146) are more objective and popular.\n\nWe now live in a world where the candidate you hire today may not fit your\ncompany\u2019s needs in the near future. Companies that are no longer hiring only\nfor hard skills but also soft skills and aptitude will likely be the first to\nfully adopt psychometrics, but before long, more and more companies will need\nto make sure they have a much better indicator of how a candidate will thrive\nand perform at their company.\n\n**Out With the Old Tests, In With the New**\n\nThe idea behind using psychometrics for business is to make an objective\neffort to assess individuals in a more thoughtful way, looking beyond\ntraditional skills and education. As organizations move toward improving the\nentire talent experience for candidates, recruiters, employees and management,\npsychometrics testing becomes an essential component of every HR strategy.\n\nTo supplement interviews and help find the right talent, many companies are\nusing personality testing for building and maintaining successful employee\nbases. While this is a good start, it\u2019s easy to risk using the wrong methods:\nMany traditional assessments have been debunked by psychologists, [such as the\ninfamous Myers-Briggs Type\nIndicator](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/give-and-\ntake/201309/goodbye-mbti-the-fad-won-t-die).\n\nPsychometrics is becoming mainstream with [science-based personality\ntesting](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/personality-quiz/). And new\npsychometric companies like Plum, Traitify, Predictive Index, and Pymetrics\nare creating assessments that can integrate easily into today\u2019s talent leader\nworkflows, like chatbots and SMS messaging, which provide next-level insights\ninto a candidate\u2019s desires, ambitions and overall behavioral patterns.\n\n**Future-Proofing Your Employees**\n\nPsychometric testing tells us who we are from a critical-thinking, creative\nand empathetic perspective -- and these are the essential foundations to build\nteams that can tackle the challenges that face us in the future of work.\n\n[A Deloitte study](https://www2.deloitte.com/al/en/pages/about-\ndeloitte/articles/2016-millennialsurvey.html#) shows candidates are likely to\nremain at a company longer if they share their organization\u2019s values.\nPsychometrics will help everyone in the talent journey quickly see if these\nvalues align. With better psychometric assessments, recruiters and talent\nmanagers not only gain insight into which candidates will be the right fit for\na role or promotion, but employees can make that call as well. When we get\nthat right, everyone wins.\n\nRecruiters and hiring managers can also use the results during the interview\nstage, developing stronger questions to address a candidate\u2019s particular\nstrengths and weaknesses. In this way, both the recruiter and management\nexperiences are enhanced. If psychometric testing reveals certain motivations\nand working behaviors, hiring managers and recruiters can tailor their\nquestions and conversations to better understand whether or not they\u2019re the\nright fit for their organization.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that answers to these tests aren\u2019t right or\nwrong; rather, they illustrate the natural tendencies of a person -- and that\nallows management to understand how to best interact, motivate and inspire a\nfuture employee. If a candidate is hired and becomes an employee, the benefits\ncontinue. Understanding an employee\u2019s motivations and preferred communication\nstyles empowers managers to have more constructive conversations that fuel\ntheir engagement and productivity at the organization.\n\nAttracting the right talent at the right time is critical to achieving\nbusiness success. With psychometrics, talent acquisition teams can be smarter\nabout uncovering candidate experiences and preferences, as well as the keys\nthat will help them thrive and prosper as employees.\n\n[Forbes Technology\nCouncil](http://www.forbestechcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology\nexecutives. **_[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbestechcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)_**\n\n[![Mahe Bayireddi](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil/files/2019/06/mahebayireddi_avatar_1560348468-400x400.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/mahebayireddi/\n\"Photo of Mahe Bayireddi\")\n\n[Mahe\nBayireddi](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/mahebayireddi/)\n\nMahe Bayireddi is CEO of [Phenom](http://www.phenompeople.com), a global HR\ntechnology company with a purpose to help a billion people find the right job.\n[Read Mahe Bayireddi's full executive\nprofile](https://profiles.forbes.com/members/tech/profile/Mahe-Bayireddi-CEO-\nCo-Founder-Phenom/f9d96d5c-d033-4973-93fb-a27550218614)\u2026\n\n Read More\n\nMahe Bayireddi is CEO of [Phenom](http://www.phenompeople.com), a global HR\ntechnology company with a purpose to help a billion people find the right job.\n[Read Mahe Bayireddi's full executive profile\nhere](https://profiles.forbes.com/members/tech/profile/Mahe-Bayireddi-CEO-Co-\nFounder-Phenom/f9d96d5c-d033-4973-93fb-a27550218614).\n\n Read Less\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Mahe Bayireddi&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: Is HR Ready For The New Age Of Psychometrics Testing? %0A Author: Mahe Bayireddi %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/07/19/is-hr-ready-for-the-new-age-of-psychometrics-testing/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

For instance, they can revamp their recruitment\nprocesses by integrating digital solutions like online proctoring to conduct\nvirtual exams and use state-of-the-art virtual hiring platforms to enable a\nseamless virtual screening and interviewing experience.\n\nBut recruiting new profiles is not enough. Business leaders also need to focus\non retaining the existing talent to avoid disruptions to business processes\nwhich, under current circumstances, can deal with a considerable blow to the\norganizational well-being. To prevent this, companies under lockdown can\nutilize virtual employee development tools to conduct effective learning and\ndevelopment (L&D) programs for fresh hires as well as existing employees.\n\n **Advantages Of Virtual Recruitment Solutions**\n\nBesides meeting the current business needs, the digital solution suite also\nprovides a superior experience than their traditional counterparts. For\ninstance, a tech-based online ecosystem allows recruiters to source, screen,\nselect candidates, offer job offers and engage them post joining virtually\nusing a diverse new-age talent management platforms.\n\nFor sourcing the right kind of candidates from a huge blend, virtual\nhackathons, contests and ideathons can be conducted to get a hang of\ncandidate's right skills and competencies. A range of virtual assessments like\npsychometrics and domain tests could be leveraged for screening candidates\nlike gauging the aptitude, attitude, cognitive skills and subject knowledge of\nthe candidates. Not limited to these, online assessments can also simulate\nreal-life business and coding simulators which can quickly test Java, C++,\nPython or any other technical language abilities.  \n\nNext in the hiring order is candidate selection which has to go digital too\nduring this time to ensure that the quarantine acts to limit physical\nmovements but not the business operations. There are multiple virtual\nplatforms designed to manage the end-to-end interviewing experience to deliver\na well-modeled and structured interview experience built around a set of\nweighted skills mapped to the job role. These tools also allow recruiters to\nmake consistent hiring decisions based on competency-driven scores, while\nfaster hiring and flexible scheduling enhance the time-to-hire metric with on-\nthe-go screening. Such virtual solutions can also be extended to campus hiring\nand lateral hiring within the organization.\n\n **Advantages Of Virtual Employee Development Solutions**\n\n\n\nAt the same time, businesses can now remotely drive the L&D plans for their\nemployees, both new hires and existing workforce on the back of 360-degree\nonline feedback tools which include digital feedback surveys, among other\nthings. Further, Virtual Assessment Centers simulate real-world Assessment\nCenters, Development Centers exercises for effective succession planning\nstrategy and plans. Companies can also access online hackathon platforms to\ncreate greater employee engagement and conduct end-to-end hackathons entirely\non the virtual domain (Another use case of hackathons).\n\nAll such new-age recruitment and L&D solutions are effectively backed by\nremote proctoring solutions wherein manual or auto proctors can invigilate\nthousands of candidates anywhere anytime and make such examinations credible,\nvalid, scalable, and cheating-proof. Apart from its remote-enablement aspect,\ncutting-edge recruitment technology permits companies to evaluate the\npotential of their workforce with more efficiency on account of its easy\nscalability, logistical comfort and ease of access for candidates. Business\nand HR leaders can now continue to remotely identify high-performing, high-\npotential candidates who can unlock greater business growth.\n\nVirtual platforms have rapidly advanced from being a catchphrase to being the\nmost accessible and effective solution to the urgent challenges that\nbusinesses are currently facing against today's quarantined backdrop. By\nensuring business continuity in the time of crisis by leveraging effective\ntech tools, organizations can emerge from the storm better, smarter and\nhealthier.\n\n## Latest on Entrepreneur\n\nCommercial Enquiries\n\nFor all commercial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [sales@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:sales@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nAffiliated Sites\n\n  * [Franchise India](http://www.franchiseindia.com)\n  * [Indian Retailer ](http://www.indianretailer.com/)\n  * [Restaurant India](http://www.franchiseindia.com/restaurant)\n  * [WellnessIndia.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness)\n  * [EducationBiz.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/education)\n  * [LicenseIndia.com](http://www.licenseindia.com)\n\nEditorial Enquiries\n\nFor all editorial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [editor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:editor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nCompany\n\n  * [Advertise](http://entrepreneurindia.com/advertisement/)\n\nProducts\n\n  * [Franchise](/franchise)\n  * [Podcasts](/listen)\n  * [Books](https://bookstore.entrepreneur.com)\n\nContributor Enquiries\n\nFor all contributor enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact\n[contributor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:contributor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nEditions\n\n  * [United States](/us)\n  * [India](/in)\n  * [Asia Pacific](/ap)\n  * [Middle East](/me)\n  * [Europe](/eu)\n  * [Espa\u00f1ol](/es)\n  * [Georgia](/ga)\n  * [South Africa](/sa)\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n[ ![Edition: March\n2020](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x4/600/20200307084422-EntrepreneurMarchCover.jpeg?width=150&quality=15)\n](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n  * [Subscribe](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n[![Entrepreneur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20190308060624-ENT-\nIndia-Logo-White.svg)](/)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/EntrepreneurInd\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/EntrepreneurIND\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entrepreneur-media-india\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/entrepreneurmedia\n\"Pinterest\")[__](https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurind/\n\"Instagram\")[__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Q3EHcO5kH9oaD4oaMvjw\n\"YouTube\")\n\n[Terms of Use](/terms-of-service) [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) [Cookies\nPolicy](/cookie-policy) [Site Map](/sitemaps/main)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

But we are expected to\nsay, yes, we are a team player.\n\n\"So, it's not necessarily the honest answer that is the correct one or the one\nthat gets you the job. You have to be able to portray yourself in the best\npossible way while still being true to your values.\"\n\n## Tests offer 'better awareness' of ourselves\n\nDr Chamorro-Premuzic says things like [unconscious\nbias](/news/2017-03-08/unconscious-bias-keeps-women-out-of-senior-\nroles/8335246), or someone with their own agenda, can influence a fair and\neffective recruitment process.\n\n\"This is why having an independent source of data or an assessment is a very,\nvery powerful tool,\" he says.\n\nMr Wilson agrees, and \u2014 though he's clear tests should co-exist with multiple\ninterviews, rigorous CV assessment and reference checking \u2014 he says\npsychometric tests \"haven't really failed me\".\n\n\"It's actually scary.

Business leaders\n> are not particularly confident right now; workforces are not particularly\n> confident right now.\n\nThat\u2019s the reality organizations are facing this year. CEO confidence is at\nits lowest levels for a decade, while millennials are worried about their\nability to achieve their ambitions at work, observes Mallon. That\u2019s set\nagainst a backdrop of concerns about climate change, a possible economic\nslowdown, the US election in November and the UK formally leaving the European\nUnion next week:\n\n> Simultaneously, in most regions of the world businesses are finding it hard\n> to find people, employment is relatively low in most places, yet struggling\n> to keep the talent they need and reward them in the right way. It just\n> strikes us that this is a year in which the HR function is asked to do more\n> with less.\n\nAgain? HR is no stranger to the idea of doing more with less, but Mallon\nbelieves the problems facing those in the role are getting harder. The best HR\ndepartments will need to do more than just ride the turbulence, but steer\ntheir organizations through it, says Mallon. In other words, make a problem\ninto an opportunity:\n\n> You could look at the tea leaves, as it were, and have reason to be\n> depressed by them, but we see a lot of evidence that the HR function can be\n> a force for good at a moment like this.\n\nTo be this \u201cforce for good\u201d it\u2019s essential HR personnel identify the things\nthat really matter to the business and focus on getting those right rather\nthan try and spread themselves too thin, says Mallon:\n\n> As we connected the dots across all the different research, it struck us\n> this is a year where HR should step back and be much, much clearer about\n> what it should be doing and exactly where it should be putting its time and\n> energies.\n>\n> The first and best thing you can do is get a sense of clarity. What is your\n> organization\u2019s purpose and how do you as an HR function play in that how do\n> you help your organization reinvent work itself with a human focus?\n\n## Letting go is good\n\nThis means having the courage to let go of some of the processes, traditions\nand work practices that are ingrained in the HR psyche and instead adopt new\nways of working. Not an easy ask, admits Mallon:\n\n> Focus is hard and it asks us to let go of some things we consider sacred or\n> tried and true.\n\nWhile these areas of focus will of course differ between organizations, Mallon\nis confident that data and analytics are likely to play a major role in most\nfirms. For example, data and analytics are challenging traditional notions of\nlearning and development. Companies are using new tools to decide how to nudge\nmanagers to behave in different ways or tackle bias in the organization, notes\nMallon, rather than have them attend a workshop:\n\n> Maybe we don\u2019t need two-day workshops any more. What we really need is\n> better use of data and to nudge our managers, on a day-to-day basis, to see\n> their role differently and make different decisions.\n\nAnother possible area of focus for HR is psychometrics. While psychometrics is\nnot a new concept - it\u2019s long been a tool for retailers to assess possible\nrecruits - Mallon contends that there are opportunities for HR to expand its\nusage to match talent to potential needs and to predict the success of\nemployees. But what this boils down to, yet again, is how comfortable HR is\nwith data and how to use it.\n\nSkills should be a key area that requires a fresh approach. HR traditionally\nfocuses on the skills and competencies needed for their organizations and how\nto reskill or upskill people to meet market changes. While that\u2019s useful,\nthere\u2019s a problem with focusing too much on skills, maintains Mallon:\n\n> [Skills] are fundamentally context-dependent and timebound. That\u2019s why they\n> are constantly expiring as technology changes, products change, the world\n> changes. I could train you in one skill and we know that in short order,\n> possibly in the next six months, but certainly in the next six years, that\n> will expire.\n>\n> Our worry is that if that\u2019s all we\u2019re focused on, it\u2019s like a hamster wheel\n> that you can never get off of and just gets faster and faster and faster.\n\nInstead of skills, companies need to look at human capabilities, such as\nempathy, creativity, analytical reasoning, storytelling and resilience -\nthings that artificial intelligence has been unable to duplicate yet. They\nhave a benefit because they are timeless and they are not context-dependent,\naccording to Mallon:\n\n> Some organizations are beginning to realize that separate from any skilling\n> efforts they can cultivate these and they are a way to future-proof.\n\nOne global retailer, notes Mallon, uses virtual reality to put its employees\nin difficult or anxiety-provoking situations as if they were customers. The\npurpose is not to teach customer service skills, its one and only aim is to\nhelp them develop a sense of empathy. Whether it\u2019s empathy, resilience, growth\nmindset, Mallon asserts that:\n\n> There are muscles there that can be strengthened over time by giving people\n> chances to practice them and to grow them that are independent of particular\n> scenarios or skills.\n\nPeering at the tea leaves further to the next 10 years, Mallon points to two\npossible trends that will become more prevalent.\n\nOne is how AI, machine learning, data and analytics will augment humans, not\nby doing things for us, but by helping to build faster or see things faster.\nSat nav is an example of how this has already become embedded in our daily\nroutines, but there will be many more areas of our lives where this will\nhappen, he suggests.\n\nThe other shift is that the HR function itself may change greatly.\nOrganizations are always going to need people expertise: experts at changing\nhuman behavior, identifying skills needed and then sourcing and supplying\nthem, plus the rules and regulations of compensation and labor. But, Mallon\ncontends:\n\n> Ten years from now, is that going to sit in a traditional HR function or is\n> that increasingly becoming so much about how much the organization operates\n> that the lines are blurred between what\u2019s human resources and what\u2019s\n> operations?\n\n> So a team leader would figure out what types of people they need for their\n> team, whether they will come from internal or external sources and how to\n> make them successful or reward them. All these things HR has traditionally\n> done as a parallel or on the side just become so intertwined that individual\n> team leaders may not consciously recognize that specialists are helping with\n> all of this because it\u2019s so interwoven.\n\nSo, HR is still there, but the lines between where it starts and stops will be\nblurred. And it goes further than the idea of the last decade of HR getting\ncloser to the business, says Mallon:\n\n> It\u2019s not so much HR coming to the business, as the business absorbing it.\n\n## My take\n\nSometimes it's important to stand back and take stock. Now would be a good\ntime to do that. It\u2019s not a case of investing heavily in new technology, but\nof looking at the way things have been done and questioning whether that is\nactually the best way to do it. If 2020 is to be a turbulent year, then, as\nthe cliche advises, let's not waste a good crisis.\n\n[ ![diginomica supports UNLEASH20 Spring London banner with

tools have long been associated with senior hires, but new\nresearch by Network HR suggests that organisations are spreading their use far\nwider than this. Peter Crush investigates.**\n\nPsychometric testing has long been seen as an exercise in telling recruiters\neither what they already knew, or what could easily be deduced from a face-to-\nface interview.\n\n## How organisations get the best out of psychometric testing (download)\n\n[![Download the full report](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cjp-rbi-\nptod/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/09/psychometric-research-\nfc-150-204.jpg)](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cjp-rbi-ptod/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2015/09/Personnel-Today-Network-HR-Psychometric-\nTesting-Research-PDF.pdf)Exclusive research from Network HR and Personnel\nToday looks at what tools are used by HR and how test results are perceived.\n**[Free download](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cjp-rbi-ptod/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2015/09/Personnel-Today-Network-HR-Psychometric-\nTesting-Research-PDF.pdf \"Psychometrics evolution: how testing has won over\nHR\")**\n\nBut new research by Personnel Today and Network HR Executive Search appears to\nshed new light on how the HR sector perceives this predominantly recruitment-\nsupporting tool.\n\nNot only do three-quarters of respondents say they use psychometrics, but 78%\nagree that it is a \"powerful tool\" for hiring.\n\nAnd perhaps most surprising of all, psychometric tests are broadly believed\nin, with 88% of respondents who use them saying they have faith in test\nresults (27% said \"a lot\" while 61% said \"quite a lot\").\n\nThings have certainly changed since the embryonic days of Victorian pioneers\nlike Francis Galton, whose early work focused on origins of intelligence.\nToday, tests range from measuring everything from attitudes to how people\nperceive things and make decisions (the well-known Myers-Briggs Indicator), to\nitem response theory (the Rasch model) on traits and people\u2019s responses to\ndifferent stimuli.\n\nManagers and HR professionals are under more pressure than ever to prove their\nhiring decisions are both accurate and well-conceived.\" - Chris Small, Saville\nConsulting\n\nThe survey, carried out among more than 350 HR and recruitment professionals,\nshows that not only are HR professionals now comfortable with psychometric\nanalysis, but also that one hitherto truism \u2013 that psychometrics are only used\nfor very senior hires \u2013 is also being challenged.\n\nThe research finds that while psychometric tests are still likely to be aimed\nat middle managers and above (they are used among 89% of senior managers and\n65% of board-level roles), some 38% of junior roles now find themselves\nsubject to a psychometric test.\n\n\u201cPsychometrics have definitely become more ingrained in recruitment culture,\u201d\nsays Chris Rowlands, director at Network HR Executive Search.\n\n\u201cIn the past, it\u2019s fair to say that HR and recruitment professionals haven\u2019t\nliked what they haven\u2019t understood and as a result veered away from testing,\nbut today the desire to identify true talent \u2013 or conversely the need to\nfilter out people that could blight organisations from within \u2013 is often the\ndominant factor.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cWhile there is still plenty of growth potential, the more HR\nprofessionals have a good experience of using it, the more this will be\nshared.\u201d\n\nChris Small, deputy CEO at psychometrics provider Saville Consulting, says he\nis not at all surprised by the spread of using tests down the pecking order.\n\u201cAt the graduate level, tests are not only being used to whittle down people\nto manageable numbers,\u201d he says, \u201cbut, crucially, to try to predict\nperformance in a role. That\u2019s the new imperative\u201d.\n\nRowlands adds: \u201cManagers and HR professionals are under more pressure than\never to prove their hiring decisions are both accurate and well-conceived\u201d.\n\n## Hiring for potential\n\nGrowth in psychometrics at lower levels is also a reflection of the general\ntrend that organisations are hiring more for potential and attitude, rather\nthan a long list of academic qualifications. \u201cThis brings psychometric tools\nto the fore,\u201d says Rowlands.\n\nOne of these companies is background checks firm HireRight. Becky Mossman, HR\ndirector, says. \u201cWe use People Clues \u2013 a tool that looks specifically at\npeople\u2019s suitability to a role, and we use it for everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe feel it\u2019s important we drill down to this minutiae, because if candidates\ndon\u2019t like our fast-paced environment, this will be revealed.\u201d She adds:\n\u201cOften people think they\u2019re suitable for our company, but psychometrics will\nreveal it might not be so, and we don\u2019t want to hire people that will quickly\nleave.\u201d\n\nWhile measuring softer attributes is clearly evident, psychometrics still\ncomes second to the most common type of selection testing \u2013 competence \u2013 with\n70% of respondents saying that their organisation tested for specific skills\nfor a role used. Psychometric testing was used by 52% in selection, followed\nby general ability (50%), numeracy (45%) and literacy (45%).\n\nThe psychometric testing market is dominated by a few big players \u2013 SHL (44%),\nMyers-Briggs (33%) Thomas International (27%) and Saville Wave (12%).\n\nPsychometrics should be moving into talent management and L&D to help identify\nskills gaps and training needs.\" - Chris Rowlands, Network HR\n\nStrong brand loyalty may be because HRDs want to stick to what they know and\nunderstand, rather than try new things. As Claire-Jayne Green, group HR\ndirector at facilities management company Servest acknowledges: \u201cOne of the\nmain challenges with psychometric testing is the vast array of tests that are\navailable. It can be difficult for practitioners to establish which tests\nadequately meet their requirements.\u201d\n\nRowlands adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a little worrying competency tests still dominate because\nthey\u2019re not looking at how people will fit into, and develop, within a role.\nThere could definitely be more education around the variety of tests out\nthere.\u201d\n\nRowlands argues that the status quo is a legacy of \"old-school\" thinking\ntoward candidate assessment within the recruitment industry, which will slowly\nupdate. That said, it is still striking that recruitment campaigns are clearly\nidentified in the survey as the single biggest use of psychometrics, with 94%\nof users taking it for this purpose alone.\n\n\u201cReally, psychometrics should be moving into talent management and L&D to help\nidentify skills gaps and training needs. At their best they are a very\npowerful tool in understanding how best to support an individual\u2019s personal\ndevelopment,\u201d he says, \u201cbut only 26% use it for talent management.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cWhile it may well be firmly on the agenda when it comes to external\nhires, we haven\u2019t yet seen psychometrics emerge as a key part of the L&D\nprofessional\u2019s toolkit.\u201d\n\n## Devil in the detail\n\nPerhaps that is because despite demonstrating confidence in the top-line\nresults of psychometrics, users still believe they are much too difficult to\nwade through in detail themselves, let alone try and give them to anyone else.\nAccording to the research, 70% of respondents said they believed that they\nrequired specific training to understand using them.\n\nThis may also explain why there is little appetite for bespoke tests over off-\nthe shelf solutions (23% vs 70%). Emily Moore, people director at Purple Cubed\nsays: \u201cWe use Inventory for Work Attitude & Motivation or iWAM and also Job\nEQ. But we admit we have kept the same tests for probably the last 10 years,\nboth because we want to stick with what we know, but also because you have to\nbe certified to read both.\u201d\n\nSmall says training on a package used to take 10 days, now Saville Consulting\nruns four-day course, so he argues the training element might be outdated\nmemories from when respondents first learned their skills.\n\nHe also says: \u201cWhat we will see, is less product inertia. As knowledge about\ndifferent tools gathers pace, HRDs will pick specific tools for specific jobs\n\u2013 such as grad recruitment or talent management.\u201d\n\nWhat is helping psychometrics gain acceptance though, argues Moore, is the\nfact that the majority of tests can now be done online. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely an\nacceptance from staff that it features more in working lives,\u201d she explains.\n\n\u201cDue to the ease of running tests, we actually do them annually, to see how\npeople\u2019s tolerances change to different questions over time. This is\nparticularly good for our management and senior populations. We use this a lot\nto form teams and it helps staff understand what drives each other too.\u201d\n\nBut there is one glaring anomaly though: If the HR community is so confident\nusing it on other people to recruit and manage them, then why has\npsychometrics made almost no impact on their own careers?\n\nThe research finds a staggering 80% of respondents had never actually been\nthrough a test themselves as part of their own recruitment into their role.\n\nPsychometrics provides something that we as humans are not very good at \u2013\nobjective, unbiased, reliable and valid measures of peoples\u2019 traits and\ncharacteristics.\" - David Hughes, Manchester Business School\n\n\u201cPerhaps there\u2019s an assumption that because HR folk are deemed \u2018people-\ncentric\u2019, a more rigorous dissection of their character isn\u2019t needed,\u201d\nsuggests Adam Oliver, consultant at Network HR Executive Search. However, he\nargues that for this very reason, and beyond, aptitudinal and behavioural\nprofiling should be especially important within the HR world.\n\n## Positive experiences\n\nOf the small 20% who had done one, most (88%) thought the experience was\npositive, and was explained to them well. This suggests that if HR\nprofessionals had greater experience and familiarity with psychometric\ntesting, the likelihood is they would be used more widely across every\ndiscipline.\n\nA positive conclusion from the survey, Rowlands summarises, is that usage and\nacceptability of psychometrics has now reached what he calls a good \u201ccritical\nmass.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe view of psychometrics as a delicate form of \u2018witchcraft\u2019 \u2013 which it\u2019s\nfair to say has been prevalent in the past \u2013 is hopefully behind us,\" he says.\n\"Businesses are increasingly confident in their application and this has to be\na positive.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s still the fact HR professionals are not wholly putting all their trust in\nthem \u2013 says Kathryn Boyd, HR director of Search Consultancy, which has\nincreased the use of psychometric testing for recruiting its own staff as well\nas that of clients. \u201cWe never use them as a standalone tool in determining an\nindividual\u2019s suitability for a role. And we believe they should only ever be\nused by recruiters who are trained to interpret reports.\u201d\n\nBut, the value pyschometrics give seems no longer to be in any question.\n\u201cPsychometrics provide something that we as humans are not very good at \u2013\nobjective, unbiased, reliable and valid measures of peoples' traits and\ncharacteristics,\u201d says David Hughes, lecturer in organisational psychology at\nManchester Business School. No-one, it seems, is arguing with this.\n\n\u201cPolarised views on psychometrics are diminishing and I\u2019d like to think\npragmatism has prevailed,\u201d concludes Rowlands. \u201cAdmittedly there can be too\nmuch confidence in them at times \u2013 we do see companies use them to create an\narbitrary cut-off point in their recruitment campaign and absolutely this is a\nfar too literal use \u2013 but our advice is always that they be used as part of a\nstructured conversation and, in the main, the industry approach is sensible.\nAs supporters of progressive HR recruitment practices we\u2019re hugely pleased\npsychometrics seem to have come of age.\u201d\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/one-third-using-\npsychometrics-training-finds-survey/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/how-could-changes-to-tax-\nfree-termination-payments-affect-employers-redundancies/)\n\n### Trackbacks/Pingbacks\n\n  1.

Idea?\n\n[Home](http://hrnews.co.uk) \u00bb [HR News](http://hrnews.co.uk/category/hr-news/)\n\u00bb Why do People Think Psychometric Tests are a Good Idea?\n\nPosted on Jun 27, 2019\n\n**The growth of psychometric testing**  \nIf you work in recruitment or are familiar with typical hiring methods you\u2019ll\nundoubtedly recognise the term psychometric testing. Despite this, you may not\nrealise to what extent psychometric testing can practically benefit your\nrecruitment strategy. In recent years psychometric testing has seen a spike in\npopularity, purportedly used by more than 75% of the Times Top 100 Companies\nin the UK and over 80% of Fortune 500 Companies in America. It\u2019s undeniable\nthat the pre-hiring tests are very much on trend in the recruitment industry\nand, in general, they are highly regarded by those who have adopted them.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/test.jpg)\n\n**Psychometric performance is linked to work performance**  \nGood psychometric test results have been statistically correlated to high job\nperformance. In fact, aside from inviting candidates for a trial day,\npsychometric tests have been proven to be the most reliable pre-hiring\nperformance indicator in the market. There have been numerous scientific\nstudies into the validity of the psychometric test together with how\nefficiently they assess a candidate\u2019s ability and there seems to be unanimous\nagreement that they are a very effective pre-cursory performance indicator.\nAssuming that the tests are conducted properly and used in conjunction with\ntraditional face to face interviews they have been cited as hugely reducing\nthe risk of hiring someone ill-suited to your team.\n\n**They reveal more than a candidate\u2019s aptitude**  \nThe word psychometric refers to the science of measuring mental capacity and\nprocesses. Psychometric tests are wholly unaffected by any factor other than\nraw intelligence and candidate potential; they are a consistent and\nstandardised measure of ability. Before the intervention of psychometric\ntesting in hiring, ascertaining candidates\u2019 mental capacity was solely down to\nthe deduction skills of the interviewer. Whilst someone can try to remain\nsubjective to the best of their ability it is almost impossible to remove\nsubconscious bias entirely - which is where psychometric testing truly earns\nits stripes. The tests can not take academic qualifications, personal history\nor previous work experience into account. Candidates answer pre-determined\nquestions which generate unambiguous results which can be easily compared to\nother candidates\u2019 scores. Employers get a fuller and better rounded impression\nof a candidate including test results that disregard any influence of human\nprejudice.\n\n**The evolution of psychometric tests**  \nOver time what we understand pre-hiring psychometric testing to be has\nevolved. There used to be a few basic tests. Now, there are a plethora of\ntests with names like situational judgement, mechanical reasoning, financial\nanalysis and resilience questionnaires. These tests no longer reveal just a\ncandidate\u2019s cognitive ability, but also determine traits such as how business-\nminded they are, how strong their leadership skills are and the type of\nworking environment they\u2019ll thrive in.\n\n**Online assessments**  \nGiven the high demand for these tests and the current rate at which all things\nare being digitised there are a large number of online providers and test\nwriters whose job it is to make sending these tests as easy and functional as\npossible. Reliable, thoroughly tested and affordable tests are now available\nat the click of a button - meaning large corporations and smaller businesses\nalike have access to the best, scientifically approved, performance assessors\navailable.\n\nBy and large, those with experience in administering psychometric tests in\ntheir hiring processes have agreed that it is a good idea. When applied\ncorrectly with the appropriate level of human assessment they have proven to\nbe a very efficient tool. The important thing to remember about these tests is\nthat they are primarily a resource to help predict the job performance of a\ncandidate before you make the decision to hire them. The necessary emphasis\nshould be placed on the word help. They were designed to be used to remove\nunconscious bias and create unprejudiced comparisons between potential new\nhires, however, they were not created to replace the traditional interview\nentirely. Test results can be worked into an interview discussion or the\nresults can be used as a method with which to refine a shortlist of high\ncalibre candidates and in doing so the pre-hiring selection process can be\ngreatly impacted.\n\n<http://www.practiceaptitudetests.com>\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fwhy-\ndo-people-think-psychometric-tests-are-a-good-\nidea%2F&linkname=Why%20do%20People%20Think%20Psychometric%20Tests%20are%20a%20Good%20Idea%3F\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fwhy-\ndo-people-think-psychometric-tests-are-a-good-\nidea%2F&linkname=Why%20do%20People%20Think%20Psychometric%20Tests%20are%20a%20Good%20Idea%3F\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fwhy-\ndo-people-think-psychometric-tests-are-a-good-\nidea%2F&linkname=Why%20do%20People%20Think%20Psychometric%20Tests%20are%20a%20Good%20Idea%3F\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fwhy-\ndo-people-think-psychometric-tests-are-a-good-\nidea%2F&linkname=Why%20do%20People%20Think%20Psychometric%20Tests%20are%20a%20Good%20Idea%3F\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fwhy-\ndo-people-think-psychometric-tests-are-a-good-\nidea%2F&linkname=Why%20do%20People%20Think%20Psychometric%20Tests%20are%20a%20Good%20Idea%3F\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/why-do-people-think-psychometric-tests-are-a-good-idea/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/why-do-people-think-psychometric-tests-are-a-good-idea/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/test-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=Why do People Think Psychometric Tests are a Good Idea?)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/why-do-people-think-psychometric-tests-are-a-good-idea/&text=Why do People Think Psychometric Tests are a Good Idea?)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

use\npredictive psychometrics technology to assist business leaders with achieving\ncorporate strategies. The range of tailored products is grounded in\nbehavioural sciences, and aims to enhance leadership insight and development\nfor YSC and its extensive client base._  \n  \nAmid the continuing [war for talent](/news/20558/uk-consultancies-reduce-\noxbridge-intake-amid-talent-shortage) across developed nations - thanks to\nrecord employment, heightened competition from start-ups, and an ageing\npopulation - it has arguably never been more important to properly evaluate\nthe fit of a potential employee. In years gone by, it might have been easy to\ndip back into a broader talent pool to seek new blood if a hire did not work\nout the first time, but now, this can prove to be a costly error of judgment.\nThat is where predictive psychometrics come into play.\n\nThe word psychometric refers to the \"measurement\" of the mind. Unlike facets\nsuch as education, skills, experience, appearance and punctuality, the\nbehavioural traits and personality of a candidate can be much more difficult\nto assess during an interview. Some employers choose to use psychometric\ntesting during their recruitment process to help give a better overall\nevaluation of a candidate and hopefully secure the best fit for the role.  \n\n![YSC Consulting partners 10x Psychology for psychometric\ninsight](/illustrations/news/detail/2019-07-30-132119685-YSC-Consulting-\npartners-10x-Psychology-for-psychometric-insight.jpg)\n\nYSC Consulting is a British-origin boutique consultancy of more than 225\nstaff, and specialises in leadership consulting, helping organisations\nidentify and develop the leaders they need to achieve their business\nstrategies. YSC works across a wide range of industries and sectors, including\nfinancial technology, biotech, private equity, healthcare, pharmaceuticals,\nfinancial services, retail, energy and media. As clients across this gamut are\nincreasingly requiring help with their HR strategy, the firm has forged a\npartnership to enhance its behavioural sciences offering to that end.\n\nBy collaborating with predictive psychometrics provider 10x Psychology, YSC is\nnow looking to enable organisations to better identify future leaders. The\nalliance will see YSC's JDI (Judgment, Drive, Influence) Model of PotentialTM\ndigitally re-imagined. As a result, organisations will be able to evaluate the\npotential of their employees through the lens of JDI, providing both real-time\ninsight into their talent populations together with tailored development\ninterventions and fast-paced feedback loops.\n\n## Future leaders\n\nRob Morris, Chief Innovation Officer, YSC, said of the news, \"One of YSC's\ngoals has always been to help organisations build leadership teams that will\nhelp them achieve their future business strategies\u2026 10x Psychology's best-in-\nclass technology will allow our team to gather these insights more accurately\nand swiftly, and help us advise our clients more effectively. It's a natural\nnext-step for us to enhance the value-proposition we've had since day one, and\nit's an exciting partnership for YSC, 10x Psychology and our clients.\"  \n  \n10x Psychology provides advanced psychometrics science, predictive analytics\nand machine learning to help businesses attract, retain and develop employees.\nIt works to blend advanced psychometric science with the power of data\nanalytics and machine learning to help businesses attract, retain, develop and\nprogress the best employees. Its wide-reaching psychometric solutions go\nbeyond traditional metrics, placing it well to assist YSC in the development\nof a joint roadmap to drive increased scale, pace and accuracy of YSC's HR\nservices.  \n  \nThe fruits of the partnership will ultimately benefit YSC's global client\nbase; the consultancy has 19 locations around the world.

personality type red, green, yellow or blue? If these mean nothing to\nyou, it's time to get acquainted with the world of psychometric testing\n\nSat, May 28, 2016 - 5:50 AM\n\n[Vivien Shiao](/authors/vivien-\nshiao)[vshiao@sph.com.sg](mailto:vshiao@sph.com.sg)[@VivienShiaoBT](https://www.twitter.com/@VivienShiaoBT)\n\n###\n\n![JT-\nPsychTest-280516.jpg](/sites/default/files/styles/article_img/public/image/2016/05/28/JT-\nPsychTest-280516_0.jpg?itok=AU7JxIVK)\n\nPHOTO: BUSINESS TIMES GRAPHICS\n\n![](/sites/all/themes/custom/businesstimes/images/application-pdf.png)\n[Zooming in on psychometric tests at\nwork](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/graphics/2016/05/28/BT_20160528_VITEST28_2306067.pdf)\n\nLIKE it or not, most people would have experienced some form of psychometric\ntesting at work.\n\nCall it a glorified personality quiz or pseudo-science if you like, but\nscepticism over its accuracy and effectiveness through the years has not put a\ndent on its popularity.\n\nCompanies that dismiss it outright might be missing out on a tool that could\nenhance HR processes and improve workplace relations, say experts.\n\nBT examines some ways companies are using psychometric testing at work, while\nbearing in mind its limitations.\n\n**Gaming the system**\n\nThe vast array of tests can be mind-boggling, with the most recognised ones\nfocusing on candidates' abilities (such as critical reasoning, verbal and\nnumerical competency), aptitude and personality.\n\n\"Increasingly, we are seeing a greater demand for tests that relate to values,\nresilience, leadership and situational judgment,\" observes Leow Hsueh Huah,\nmanaging director of Kosh Consulting Group.\n\nThere are also tests that are function-specific, such as for sales or\nmarketing roles.\n\nDavid Jones, senior managing director of Asia Pacific, Robert Half, explains\nthat it is often used for jobs that require interaction for customers such as\nprivate wealth management, consulting or sales, as personality traits are\nconsidered an important part of a candidate's potential to succeed.\n\nThe cost for such tests is similarly varied and can range from zero to more\nthan a grand, depending on the role and the extensiveness of testing required.\n\nAs such, HR companies observe that the use of psychometric testing is more\nfrequent in larger corporations rather than smaller SMEs.\n\n\"Companies using these tests often apply them to senior positions that require\na specialised skills set. For junior roles that involve a lower level of\nskills compared to senior positions, an interview is likely to be sufficient\nto assess a candidate,\" says Mr Jones.\n\nOne concern often raised is the possibility of candidates exaggerating or\nfaking their results.\n\nLynne Roeder, managing director of Hays Singapore, says that while it is not a\nfoolproof way of assessing one's capabilities, these tests are often designed\nto weed out untruths and provide a fairly accurate baseline.\n\nLikewise, Mr Leow points out that all good instruments embed questions that\ndetect the extent to which candidates give socially desirable responses.\n\nIn addition, different companies look for different qualities, so it might be\ntricky or pointless to try to \"game the system\".\n\nFor example, a company might want to hire a salesperson who is results-driven\nand yet a team player, rather than a results-driven person that is aggressive\nand dominant. In this case, second-guessing what the companies want can\nbackfire.\n\n**Beyond recruitment:**\n\n**Chevron case study**\n\nPsychometric tests may be most prevalent in recruitment, but they can also be\nused as part of a company's talent development and team building plans.\n\nEnergy company Chevron has taken it one step further by integrating\npsychometric testing into its daily business activities and organisational\nculture.\n\nJust three years ago, Chevron started using E-Colors - a personality diversity\nindicator developed by Equilibria Services Limited - in the International\nProducts business unit of eight of their key markets in Asia Pacific, South\nAfrica and the Middle East.\n\nUsing the E-Colors process, employees can be identified by their primary and\nsecondary colors, with a maximum of 12 E-Color combinations.\n\nThe traits of the four different E-Colors are: Red - doer and director, Green\n- thinker and analyser, Yellow - influencer and socialiser and Blue - relater\nand supporter.\n\nThrough this means of testing, Chevron says each employee is able to heighten\nself-awareness of their own communication style, behavioural tendencies,\nstrengths and potential limiters.\n\nThey are then able to make conscious choices in their interactions and select\nthe right approach for the right situation.\n\nAs an indication of how deeply it has been entrenched in the company's\nculture, employees even have their E-Colors in their e-mail signatures. This\ncomes in handy when meeting new colleagues as they get a sense of their\npersonality traits.\n\nWith psychometric tests there is always the danger of stereotypes, but Chevron\nsays it tries to mitigate this by proper training and having a code of ethics\nin place.\n\nSome no-nos include implying that one E-Color combination is better than\nanother, and filling positions or granting promotions based on E-Colors. It is\nalso no excuse to shirk work responsibilities, unfair work allocation or\nunacceptable behaviour.\n\nEmployees are not forced to take the E-Colors test or display their results if\nthey do not want to.\n\nOverall, Chevron says such awareness has led to improved relationships between\nsupervisors and direct reports, and greater diversity of thought.\n\nBased on the company's internal qualitative research from 2013-2015, 90 per\ncent of colleagues believe that having such a system drives business\nperformance.\n\n**Jury's still out**\n\nUltimately, while psychometric tests may predict personality tendencies, they\ndo not take into account a host of other factors such as character, personal\nbeliefs, values and moods.\n\nTherefore, psychometric tests - no matter how valid or reliable - cannot be\nused in isolation for decision-making, especially when it comes to\nrecruitment, talent-spotting and promotions.\n\nThey are, at best, a complementary tool to traditional techniques such as\ninterviews, reference checks and evaluations of past performance, says Foo\nChek Wee, HR director of Zalora.\n\nHe explains that the usefulness of such tests lies not in the tools\nthemselves, but rather in how they are leveraged during and after the tests\nare completed.\n\n\"A psychometric test done in a one-off team-building exercise may lead to\ngreater understanding of individuals. But if that understanding has no\ncommitted follow-up actions, the investment of time and money on the test\nstays and ends at the activity,\" points out Mr Foo.\n\n[![](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/article-\ntelegram.png)](https://t.me/BizTimes)\n\n  * [psychometric test](/keywords/psychometric-test)\n  * [cubicle

But at the same time, only one in three, that\u2019s about 37\npercent of them said they were \u201cvery confident\u201d about HR\u2019s actual ability to\ntransform and move them forward. This disconnect between future goals and the\ncurrent skills can prove to be costly as the future of work becomes\nincreasingly digital,\n\nHR teams resort to a number of measures to identify training needs of\nemployees. Speaking about some of the methods, **Vinod Kumar, Global Head of\nHuman Resources at Greenlight Planet** said that the company engages in \u201cfocus\ngroup discussions, runs learning analysis surveys, engages in skill share\nsessions and then the L&D team builds short, medium and long term goals\u201d\n\nOne of the first steps in identifying the future roadmap on skills is to\nunderstand where you are currently. Whether reviewing a potential candidate\nfor a new job role or identifying possible focus areas for employees to\nupskill themselves, knowing where they currently stand, can help you gain\ngreater clarity in identifying not just the skills and competencies that are\nrequired but also \u2018who\u2019 needs to be upskilled for \u2018what\u2019.\n\n### The role of learning agility and proximity testing\n\nBefore identifying specific technical skillsets that are needed on the job, it\nis important to identify which of your employees is ready to learn and which\nof them is closest to the skills that are needed to fulfill your strategic\ngoals.\n\n### What is learning agility?\n\n\u201cLearning Agility is the ability to continually and rapidly learn, unlearn,\nand relearn mental models and practices from a variety of experiences, people,\nand sources, and to apply that learning in new and changing contexts to\nachieve desired results,\u201d said **Siddharth Gupta, CEO, Mercer Mettl.**\n\nIs the employee oriented to learn? What is the individual\u2019s propensity to\nlearn new things faster? Testing employees on behavioral attributes such as\nopen mindedness, inquisitiveness, mastery etc., can identify the right\nemployee you need to invest in.\n\nThe second aspect that\u2019s critical to assess is the proximity of the employee\nto the desired skillset. Which among your employees can pick up a new\ntechnical skill, which of them can learn the skill fastest based on the\ncurrent stack of skills they already have?\n\nTechnology tools are capable of assessing your employees on both, learning\nagility as well as on proximity. Leveraging custom assessments that are\ntailored to your business context and testing for skills needed to execute\nyour projects will enable teams to succeed.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding which of your employees is best placed to skill themselves \u2013\nboth from a learning readiness perspective as well as from a knowledge\nperspective will help drive effectiveness in learning. From a cost\nperspective, it is saves precious time and training costs,\u201d said Siddharth.\n\n### Leveraging holistic assessments tools\n\nThere are different ways to conduct a skill gap analysis \u2013 including\nbehavioral, cognitive and technical. Depending on the level of expertise and\ndepth required, a combination of assessments can be employed to assess a\ncandidate.\n\n### Psychometrics\n\nUnderstanding personality types and behaviors can help you identify the right\nperson for the job. And assessing personality traits can help you gain\ninsights into whether an individual fits into the workplace culture, is\ntrainable. And to understand the capability and drive they can bring to\nperform their work.\n\nPsychometric tests measure four key traits: 1) Positive personality traits, 2)\nNegative Personality traits, 3) Motivations, values and preferences and the 4)\nCognitive ability \u2013 an individual\u2019s capacity to think logically and analyze.\n\n### 360-degree tools\n\nAnother way to assess candidate readiness to simply ask the employee\u2019s peers,\ndirect reports and the manager.\n\n\u201cConstructive feedback from one another facilitates employees to align each\nother to the overall business objectives and managing of people. In this\nendeavour, the right balance and constructive feedback can be maintained when\nit is given from all stakeholders of an employee,\u201d said **Shiraz Latiff, CEO,\nHummingbird International**\n\nCompanies also use a combination of assessments and 360 degree feedback tools\nto help understand the skills and competencies needed at work. Whether it\u2019s\nperformance assessments, training need identification or succession planning,\n360 degree tools provide insights into hidden strengths, possible blind spots\nand areas of opportunities in a way that regular assessment.\n\n### Aptitude and technical knowledge\n\nWhether it\u2019s to understand which of your employees ranks high on fluid\nreasoning (the ability to perceive things and absorb new information) and\ncrystallized reasoning ( the ability to retrieve or use information acquired\nover a lifetime/ use of pre-acquired knowledge), or to understand the specific\nskillset within a technology skill, aptitude tests help understand can perform\ntasks required on the job.\n\nIs the employee able to make decisions based on observed data and experience?\nAre they able to deal with ambiguity and make intelligent decisions?\n\n### Simulation tools and live projects\n\nSimulation tools like Basic Coding, Database Simulator, R Simulator, Full\nStack Simulation can not only help understand the thought process of the\nindividual, it can also help observe how the person would respond in a live\nsituation. Simulations can help practice and learn from a given situation\napart from assessing the candidate.\n\nAnother method of enabling people to succeed is to engage them in live\nprojects. Vinod from Greenlight Planet said that the company engages their\nhigh potentials in \u201caction learning projects \u2013 which helps them work together,\ncollaborate with a mentor to complete the task at hand\u201d\n\nOnce employees undergo one test or a combination of these tests, a learning\nroadmap can be aligned by taking into account the skill gap. In order to make\nsure that the learning course has been effective, candidates can once again\ntake the assessment post learning.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics:\n[Assessments](/category/assessment/assessments?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=assessments\n\"Browse more in: Assessments\"), [Learning &\nDevelopment](/category/compensation-performance/training-\ndevelopment?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=training-development \"Browse\nmore in: Learning &amp; Development\"), [#DecodeTalent](/tag/decode-\ntalent?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=decode-talent \"Browse more in:\nDecodeTalent\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![J Jerry Moses](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1442828069/authors/j-jerry-\nmoses.jpg)](/author/j-jerry-moses)\n\n#### [J Jerry Moses](/author/j-jerry-moses)\n\nJ Jerry Moses is a Content Manager at People Matters.

Businesses are also dealing with newer talent challenges. In the IT\nsector, for instance, there is an ongoing focus on creating a leaner middle\nand senior management layer even as companies are hiring extensively at the\nentry level. This is a trend that is linked directly to the skills gap\nchallenge \u2013 where fresh candidates are being trained with new skills, while\nexperienced workers unwilling to upskill are fired.\n\nIn order to navigate growth or to drive productivity, companies need to find\nthe right talent. 42% of the companies that participated in Mercer-Mettl\u2019s\n\u201cTech hiring and technology adoption trends 2019\u201d study said that they are\nunable to source the desired quality of candidates. This is despite the fact\nthat companies already using a number of screening tools which include a\ncombination of MCQ and coding simulators, paper based and white board\ntechnical assessments. According to the same report, companies are planning to\nincrease their tech hiring by 21% over the last year. And the success of the\ntech hiring process rate is currently only 50 percent, on average.\n\nTo make the most of the process, companies need to be able to evaluate a\ncandidate holistically \u2013 they need to assess their technical knowledge,\nbehavioural competencies and readiness. For the first time, companies have\naccess to tools that can measure learning readiness as well as skill\nproximity. Raghavendra K, Vice President and Head, Human Resources, Infosys\nBPM said that \u2018holistic assessments\u2019 are extremely critical. He added that a\ndedicated Center of Excellence (COE) at the company evaluates existing\ncompetencies, their potential and readiness of the talent.\n\nAs the number of companies strategizing for the future rises, here\u2019s how\ncompanies can identify the skills they need for the future:\n\n### 1\\. Define a competency framework\n\nOne way of breaking down the job requirements for the future is by identifying\ndifferent competencies by categories of skills needed in the form of a\n\u2018competency framework\u2019. The aim is to break down competencies according to\ncognitive skills, behavioral skills and technical/domain specific skills.\nAligning specific competencies to jobs can help identify current and future\ncandidates.\n\nFor example, take the case of a financial analyst \u2013 the domain specific\nknowledge would knowledge about the Balance sheet reconciliation, Accounts\nreceivable/ payable. The behavioral skills could include planning and\norganization, stress management, establishing trust, teamwork etc., while the\ncognitive skills would include numerical reasoning, analytical ability,\nproblem solving etc. This step can include any emerging skills either in\ntechnology or experience in working in cross functional teams etc.,\n\n### 2\\. Align assessments mapped to the jobs\n\nThe next step in ensuring that you\u2019re identifying the right talent for the job\nis to ensure that you assess candidates based on these competencies. By\naligning assessments for the job, not only can employees be upskilled,\nprospective candidates can also be directly assessed.\n\nAt Infosys, Raghavendra pointed out that the hiring and role change\nconsideration requests are linked to the company\u2019s competency framework.\n\n\u201cVirtual assessments, leadership assessments,360-Degree assessments are linked\nto the Infosys BPM competency framework that enable the company to strengthen\ndata-driven decision making for role change considerations. In addition to\nproviding insights on learning & development interventions, the assessments\nhelp in talent pipeline building, career development, talent engagement and\nretention,\u201d he said.\n\n### 3\\. Measure impact and work on the feedback\n\nAssessments can help bring a qualitative shift in hiring. The costs incurred\non hiring the wrong candidates and losing productivity at work can be brought\ndown by hiring for the right fit. Speaking about the impact of holistic talent\nassessments, Sheetal Sandhu, CHRO, ICRA noted that \u201cholistic talent\nassessments lead to significant results, including productivity increase, cost\nsavings, decreased attrition.\u201d\n\nAdministering tests online also cuts down on the time. It offers a quick and\nhassle free process that speeds up the hiring process. \u201cOrganizations using\nimmersive, compelling assessments experiences with technology enabled online\nassessments are seeing immediate results and feedback,\u201d Sheetal said.\n\n### 4\\. Keep up with new content and assessments\n\nOne of the key challenges in administering tests on future readiness is\nstaying up to date on advances in testing content and methods. Unless a\ncompany has access to a dedicated team that can monitor and plug-in\ndevelopments across the business and map them to future needs, there\u2019s little\nprogress that companies can make themselves. This is where the effectiveness\nof specialists can greatly reduce the work and effort needed to bring best\npractices.\n\n\u201cFocusing on industry specific best practices is knowledge that most companies\nneed, but not all companies can afford to invest in. This is where specialist\nassessment experts come in. They can help map your hiring needs to future-\nlooking trends with benchmarked data,\u201d said Siddhartha Gupta, CEO, Mercer\nMettl. Having access to such data can help align the business needs to\nindustry shifts.\n\nHiring the right candidate necessitates a strong understanding of the market,\nand being able to articulate what your ideal candidate should look like in the\ncontext of your company\u2019s culture. As new jobs emerge, and old ones get\naugmented with the power of automation, having a robust skills roadmap is the\nonly way to weather the uncertain storm. Continuous digital transformation is\nchanging the landscape of business \u2013 right from the way companies allocate\nresources, the way they innovate and how they hire.\n\nCompanies need to invest not just in identifying the right courses, but they\nneed to continuously ensure that the program is personalized to the learning\nneeds of the employee. The input about the method of learning \u2013 whether that\u2019s\nformal learning programs like classroom sessions etc., or informal learning\nchannels like byte sized learning tools, gamification tools and so on needs to\nbe aligned to the content. Assessments can help in understand the\neffectiveness of the content, the learning delivery as well as the learning\npotential of the employee.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics:\n[Assessments](/category/assessment/assessments?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=assessments\n\"Browse more in: Assessments\"), [Behavioural\nAssessments](/category/assessment/behavioural-\nassessments?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=behavioural-assessments\n\"Browse more in: Behavioural Assessments\"), [Strategic\nHR](/category/leadership-strategy/strategic-\nhr?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=strategic-hr \"Browse more in: Strategic\nHR\"), [#DecodeTalent](/tag/decode-\ntalent?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=decode-talent \"Browse more in:\nDecodeTalent\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Authors\n\n[![J Jerry Moses](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1442828069/authors/j-jerry-\nmoses.jpg)](/author/j-jerry-moses)\n\n#### [J Jerry Moses](/author/j-jerry-moses)\n\nJ Jerry Moses is a Content Manager at People Matters.

Faragher\") on 31 May 2019 in [General Data Protection\nRegulation](https://www.personneltoday.com/employment-law/data-\nprotection/gdpr/),

ancestry and medical insights has become increasingly\npopular as the technology matures, but what impact could it have on talent\ndevelopment at work? Jo Faragher looks at the emergence of genetic assessments\nthat can predict potential and help develop people\u2019s careers. Are they an\nethical minefield or the future of workplace assessment?**\n\nLast year, China\u2019s Ministry of Science and Technology revealed that athletes\naiming to represent the country at the 2022 Winter Olympics would undergo\ngenetic testing as part of the official selection process.\n\n\u201cComplete genome sequencing will be applied on outstanding athletes competing\nin the winter games for speed, endurance and explosive force, with at least\n300 athletes in each group,\u201d stated an official document. The belief is that\ncoaches can detect certain academic prowess from someone\u2019s genes and can then\nfocus their training accordingly to build the best possible team.\n\nTo most people, this feels more like a scene from Brave New World than a\ncontemporary, government-backed initiative. Yet the role of genetic analysis\nin our work and personal lives could be closer than we think.\n\nMany of us will be aware of \u2013 or may have used \u2013 tests that can tell us about\nour ancestry or potential medical conditions from companies such as\nAncestry.co.uk or 23andMe, but a handful of companies is now emerging that\nclaim our DNA profile can predict our potential at work.\n\nThe process is the same, an individual provides a saliva sample that is sent\nto a laboratory. The lab isolates the genetic make-up from the sample and maps\nthis against a huge database of DNA markers that, in combination, may be\nlinked to certain \u2018traits\u2019 or talents.\n\nSome companies marry this with other, more conventional psychometric or\npersonality tests to build a bigger picture of how that person likes to work,\nwhat motivates them, and how their work environment has shaped them. The\nsubject receives a report and follow-up call detailing the findings and how\nthey might use them to develop themselves.\n\n## The rise of personal genomics\n\nLast year, [Blueprint, a book by Robert\nPlomin](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/sep/29/so-is-it-nature-not-\nnurture-after-all-genetics-robert-plomin-polygenic-testing), explored the rise\nof so-called \u201cpersonal genomics\u201d, advocating how advances in genetic science\nmean we can now identify whether a newborn baby might be susceptible to\ndepression, or prone to becoming obese in later life. Plomin argues that DNA\nanalysis will not just be the preserve of medical research or Chinese sports\ncoaches \u2013 it could also indicate potential for practical applications such as\nhow good we are at maths or spatial awareness, or help guide children in the\nright career direction.\n\nWe can ask people if they're still happy with the choices they made\nsubconsciously earlier in their lives. When we look at behaviour the brain has\na working model that deals with information that's present , and a lot of it\nis based on assumptions that go back to our DNA, and have never been\nchallenged\u201d \u2013 Wouter van den Berg, BrainCompass\n\nCompanies offering DNA-based assessments are part of this wave, essentially\nusing big data analysis techniques that map an individual\u2019s genetic sequence\nagainst thousands of data points from DNA databases. A certain combination of\ngenes might, for example, be able to tell us if someone takes rejection\neasily, or is suited to leadership. \u201cIt gives you a total overview of all the\ntalents at your disposal, including the hidden ones,\u201d says Wouter van den\nBerg, founder of DNA-based assessment company BrainCompass. His company also\nruns tests for attachment styles, personality assessment and professional\nmindset.\n\n\u201cWe can ask people if they're still happy with the choices they made\nsubconsciously earlier in their lives. When we look at behaviour the brain has\na working model that deals with information that's present, and a lot of it is\nbased on assumptions that go back to our DNA, and have never been challenged,\u201d\nhe says.\n\nBecause our personalities are a mixture of nature and nurture, however, DNA\ncan only ever point to potential \u2013 it can never 100% predict behaviour. Van\nden Berg describes this as the difference between \u201cprediction and\nempowerment\u201d. He adds: \u201cWe enter the process when an employee (sometimes with\ntheir employer) decides they want to make a next step to a new goal; we're\nasked to provide the most efficient route to that goal.\u201d\n\nHe says BrainCompass attracts two types of customers: \u201cThose who are\naddressing a specific problem \u2013 they want to solve something particular or\nacute, help redefine their journey. Or they\u2019re looking at their career from a\nbroader perspective.\n\n\u201cPerhaps they\u2019ve reached an age where they\u2019re looking for a new career move,\nor they see a reorganisation on the cards.\u201d By seeing traits they\u2019re\ngenetically predisposed to, such as risk-taking, they can use this knowledge\nto make decisions or choose a development path.\n\nMore broadly, this sort of analysis could be used to support societal change.\n\u201cI\u2019ve not found a single recruiter who\u2019s not blown away by this,\u201d says Bas van\nde Haterd, a consultant and speaker on recruitment innovation. \u201cYou could use\nit to see what sports might be good for your child, what type of education\nmight suit them, whether to give them a book or encourage them to play\nfootball.\u201d Imagine if we could define the gene sequence that made someone a\npaedophile, he suggests, and they could be prevented from working with\nchildren?\n\n## DNA and decisions\n\nIf this screams [Minority\nReport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_\\(film\\)) rather than\nethical workplace practice, then you\u2019re not alone. Legal and assessment\nexperts raise questions on the reliability of DNA to predict someone\u2019s\npoptential, on consent and privacy issues around gathering data, and the\nethical issues if an employer decides to use these insights to make decisions\nabout someone\u2019s career progression, future role or salary.\n\nThe most important issue will be consent, says Barry Stanton, head of\nemployment at law firm Boyes Turner. \u201cWill individuals consent to their DNA\nbeing taken and tested if that is going to result in decisions being taken\nabout recruitment, promotion or training? If the ability to be promoted or\neven recruited is linked to a DNA test, then the individual is being given\nlittle option but to agree,\u201d he argues.\n\n\u201cThe risk then becomes that employees are, essentially, compelled to take a\nDNA test in the hope of advancement. That carries with it the risk that claims\nwill follow from those who do not wish to undergo testing that the employer\nhas destroyed the bond of trust and confidence.\u201d\n\nCompanies come to us because their executives want to know what kind of leader\nthey are - I worked hard, got the right education, got this position, but am I\na good leader?\u201d \u2013 Albert Akkermans, Goldmen Genetics.\n\nProviders, for their part, emphasise that the tools should only be used by a\nconsenting employee for their personal development purposes, and absolutely\nnot for hiring or selection. Kyriakos Kokorris, CEO of Karmagenes, says many\ncustomers apply their findings to their personal lives rather than, or as well\nas, their careers.\n\n\u201cCustomers get a 25-page report with a diagram of their traits, and an\nexplanation of them,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey also get a customised analysis based\non their assessment profile with suggestions for how this can be applied to\nyour personal life or to improve your wellbeing. For example, perhaps you want\nto be more spontaneous. If you have a low stress tolerance, how can we help\nyou take more time to make decisions?\u201d\n\nAndrew Secker, principal associate at law firm Mills & Reeve, compares the\ngrowing interest in DNA analysis to the potential many employers saw in\nwearables a few years ago.\n\n![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/05/shutterstock_1410689171.jpg)\"Firstly, like\nwearable technology which came before it, this type of testing makes the\nresults seem attractive,\u201d he says. \u201cSwap out \u2018deliver a healthier, more\nproductive workforce\u2019 for \u2018make smarter business decisions and maximise the\nnatural strengths of your workforce\u2019, and we\u2019re hearing a message we\u2019ve heard\nbefore.\n\n\u201cBut just like wearable tech, an employer who wants to adopt this needs to\nwork through the privacy aspects and the invasion of privacy this will\ngenerate,\u201d he adds.\n\n\u201cThe core problem here is there is highly likely to be a less intrusive way of\nobtaining the aim (making sound decisions), making the processing of this type\nof data inherently difficult.\u201d\n\nJonathan Maude, a partner at Vedder Price, believes the main concern in\nexploring DNA-based assessment would be a breach of privacy rules, namely the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation.\n\n\u201cBecause of the highly sensitive nature of this data, it requires a higher\nlevel of protection under GDPR,\u201d he says. \u201cThe sensible way of looking at it\nis to ask what would we have in place to protect us if there were allegations\nof a breach? Is it encrypted?\u201d\n\nKokorris acknowledges the data security risks and takes them very seriously.\n\u201cWhen we take the sample, we apply cryptography, send it to the lab. There\u2019s\nno way of the lab being able to connect it to one individual,\u201d he says. \u201cThe\ndata is deleted after six months and once the analysis is done it\u2019s\ndisregarded. The only thing that stays on our database is the report, and that\ncan\u2019t be related to an individual.\u201d\n\nTwo other companies in this field, BrainCompass and Goldmen Genetics, are both\nbased in The Netherlands, which passed its own data protection legislation in\n2016 in advance of GDPR. BrainCompass\u2019 platform received a full audit by the\nDutch authorities, while Goldmen disposes of any DNA-related data once it has\nbeen analysed and requires employers to sign non-disclosure agreements if\nworkers agree to undergo a test.\n\n\u201cCompanies come to us because their executives want to know what kind of\nleader they are \u2013 I worked hard, got the right education, got this position,\nbut am I a good leader?\u201d says Albert Akkermans, founder of Goldmen Genetics.\n\n\u201cDNA analysis can take you to the next level. Someone might be a good\nentrepreneur, but once they\u2019re managing 100 people are they still a good\nleader? They might be a great entrepreneur but not good at dealing with the\nday-to-day operations of the business that need to be done.\u201d\n\nAkkermans passionately believes that DNA analysis will change our lives as we\nlearn more and more about how it shapes our potential. The Chinese government\nchoosing to use genetic sequencing to build its Olympic team is just the\nstart. \u201cThe next thing could be genetic modification. If you don\u2019t have the\n\u2018right\u2019 DNA, can we change something? I think in two to three years we will be\nready for this,\u201d he says.\n\n## Recruitment and resourcing opportunities on Personnel Today\n\n  \n[**Browse more recruitment and resourcing\njobs**](https://jobs.personneltoday.com/jobs/recruitment-and-resourcing/)\n\nBut Ryne Sherman, chief science officer at Hogan Assessment Systems, argues\nthat he could be overstating the workplace insights we can get from someone\u2019s\nDNA.\n\n\u201cGenes play an important role in who we are but there is no evidence of a link\nbetween one single DNA structure and people\u2019s personality traits. There\u2019s no\nsingle gene for impulsiveness for example,\u201d he says. \u201cThe effect of one could\nbe tiny if not unnoticeable. The science just is not there yet to say with any\nconfidence someone will behave a certain way because of their genes.\nFurthermore, what could be more personal than your DNA? It\u2019s the most private\ndata you own.\u201d\n\nStanton adds that grouping traits in this way could also have unintended\nconsequences, particularly if this science is ever applied to recruitment:\n\u201cRelatively little is understood about how genes interact with each other and\nthe impact of gene sequencing,\u201d he says.\n\nHe's concerned that ethnicity data could be extrapolated from individuals'\ncore characteristics and innate abilities and that that could pose a\nsignificant risk that stereotypical decisions will be reached.\n\n\u201cIf, for example, a role required someone with an outgoing personality and the\nDNA results demonstrated that a person had 50% DNA from a grouping perceived\nto be more reserved, a refusal to appoint on that basis might result in a\nsuccessful race discrimination claim on the basis of ethnic origins.\u201d\n\n## Why so controversial?\n\nBut van den Berg from BrainCompass argues that sophisticated psychometrics\ntests already step into the sensitive data category that attracts greater\nprotection under GDPR, so why should genetic testing for development purposes\nattract such fear?\n\nHelen Jamieson from HR consulting and training company Jaluch makes the same\npoint: \u201cInterestingly, psychometric profiling in business is increasingly\nvalued and respected, and not seen as particularly controversial.\n\n[![DNA test](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/05/shutterstock_795466444.jpg)](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/05/shutterstock_795466444.jpg)\n\nA doctor prepares to collect DNA.  \nPhoto: Dusan Petkovic/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cGenetic testing is. Why is one viewed as personally intrusive while the other\nis not? Perhaps it\u2019s because over time acceptability has increased as culture\nhas moved towards a better understanding of, and focus on individual\npsychology. This might happen in due course with DNA testing.\u201d\n\nThe data is deleted after six months and once the analysis is done it\u2019s\ndisregarded. The only thing that stays on our database is the report, and that\ncan\u2019t be related to an individual\u201d \u2013 Kyriakos Kokorris, Karmagenes\n\nIn short \u2013 it should never be used as the sole deciding factor in any sort of\ncareer-related decision. \u201cDanger lies in allowing this data, which is entirely\nobjective in nature, to infiltrate into areas that require subjective\nconsiderations \u2013 such as hiring for certain roles,\u201d says Sophie Rothwell from\nlaw firm Child & Child, Globalaw. \u201cWhile data science can offer employers an\nabundance of opportunity, it is important not to let it inadvertently restrict\nor create unnecessary boundaries.\u201d\n\nThe future of DNA-based assessment could well rest on how palatable it is to\nthe general public, and the transparency of those offering it. If privacy is\nassured and people believe there is something positive in it for them, there\ncould be a growing acceptance.\n\nBrainCompass reports that around 7,500 people are using its platform, a\nquarter of whom are corporate clients. Around 1,000 have taken Karmagenes\u2019\ntest. Not everyone has good intentions, according to van den Berg at\nBrainCompass. \u201cWe get calls once or twice a week asking whether the test can\nbe used to downsize,\u201d he says. \u201cFirstly, we would never do this from an\nethical standpoint and secondly there\u2019s no data to suggest this would be\naccurate. This all stems from the idea, the myth, that DNA has some\ndeterministic factors. You are not a product of your DNA, you\u2019re a product of\nhow your DNA interacts with everything else.\u201d\n\nHe likens it to caterpillars and butterflies having the same DNA. \u201cWith talent\ndevelopment, we can help shape that interaction, help shape someone into a\nbutterfly,\u201d he concludes. Whether employers will be able to overcome their\nethical and legal concerns over using employees\u2019 genetic make-up to realise\ntheir potential, however, could be way over the horizon.\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/shift-work-breast-cancer-\nstudy/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/worker-dressed-as-black-and-\nwhite-minstrel-racial-harassment/)\n\n##### No comments yet.\n\n### Leave a Reply [Click here to cancel reply.](/hr/could-dna-be-the-key-to-a-\nsuccessful-career/#respond)\n\nComment\n\nName (required)\n\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\n\nWebsite\n\n### Related posts:\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2020/02/virtual-reality.jpg)Why data capture from\nemployees needs to be ethical](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/why-data-\ncapture-on-employees-needs-to-be-ethical/ \"Why data capture from employees\nneeds to be ethical\")\n\nVirtual reality training can be hugely beneficial but the data captured by it\nmust be handled with great care.\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/06/donald-trump.jpg)Is ethical leadership under\nthreat from populism?](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/is-ethical-\nleadership-under-threat-from-populism/ \"Is ethical leadership under threat\nfrom populism?\")\n\nEthical leadership, fairness and equality are seen as vital qualities for\nsuccessful organisations.

sample Good&Co; psychometric profile uses familiar faces to help depict\npersonality  \nImage: Good&Co;\n\n**Psychometric tests used to be long, formal exercises candidates would take\nsome way into the recruitment process. But could testing potential applicants\nbefore they even apply mean employers get a better fit, or more of the same?\nPeter Crush investigates.**\n\nIf you think you\u2019ve seen everything to do with psychometrics, think again.\nStart-up Good&Co is one of a growing number of digital disrupters,\ndeliberately shaking things up.\n\n## Psychometric assessments\n\n**[Recruitment selection techniques: Good practice\nmanual](http://www.xperthr.co.uk/good-practice-manual/recruitment-selection-\ntechniques/151923/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n**[Take part in our recruitment trends\nsurvey](http://www.xperthr.co.uk/editors-choice/take-part-in-our-recruitment-\ntrends-\nsurvey/162584/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\nOut are boring, monotonous questions, apparently covering the same thing; in\nare barely-there \u201ctests\u201d that couldn\u2019t be more fun, or cryptic if they tried \u2013\nwith conundrums such as \u2018Congrats - you\u2019ve won a free ski-diving lesson: \u2018Re-\ngift it!\u2019 or \u2018Let me at it\u2019 [complete with a sliding scale users move to\nindicate how much they agree].\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just that this is a fast, app-based test that attention-short\nmillennials can take on their smartphones; it\u2019s what the results say, and how\nthey\u2019re going to be used that is really interesting \u2013 particularly as the aim\nis for candidates to take these tests before they even formally apply for a\nrole.\n\n\u201cThe results give users three highly accurate key personality traits [like\n\u2018straight shooter\u2019 or \u2018strategist\u2019] plus a short-tag line to go with it,\u201d\nexplains partnerships manager Tom Mason.\n\n\u201cBut key is applicants being able to search for specific people in\norganisations (that they might be working with) that have already done our\ntests, or company personality aggregations, to indicate whether they\u2019ll get\nalong.\u201d There are more than 2,000 corporate profiles on the database so far.\n\n## Compatibility tests\n\nOnce searched for, users can see, for example that their \u2018thinking styles\u2019 are\nX% compatible, or that \u2018competitively\u2019 they are X% similar, with an overall\ncompatibility score generated.\n\nGood&Co is now part of StepStone, which owns job boards Jobsite and Totaljobs,\nand there are plans to include details of the app on job ads so jobseekers can\ndo their own psychometric test before they even apply, or so employers can set\nthresholds for candidates before they apply.\n\nBut is this (and should this) be the future? For sure, applying psychometrics\nearlier in the process is a departure from the near-the-end rubber-stamping\nrole psychometrics normally takes. But, advocates not only argue there\u2019s no\nreason why it shouldn\u2019t; they think it\u2019s actually better this way.\n\n\u201cIt sort of makes sense,\u201d argues Gareth Jones, COO at Headstart AI, which has\ndeveloped technology that invisibly applies psychometric tests at the point\napplicants apply to a company\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cSaving psychometrics till the end is like taking whoever\u2019s left after an\ninterview process and trying to fit them against a profile that might be\ndifferent to what the interviewers were assessing on,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBecause we identify the desired profile for each advertised role first,\nhaving psychometrics early then works much harder, actively identifying the\npeople best suited to go to the next level.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cInstead of the alignment of people to the role being at the end, the\nalignment should be the first part of the process. To me, the earlier\npsychometrics are used, the better.\u201d\n\n## What about diversity?\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a fear that, by applying psychometrics early, employers risk\nsimply ending up with exactly the same types of people, to the exclusion of\nseeing others that may not have cleared this initial hurdle, but bring\ndifferent qualities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a worry, but it needn\u2019t be,\u201d argues Jayson Darby, psychology manager,\nThomas International. \u201cOur research actually suggests psychometrics improves\ndiversity because they remove unconscious human bias and seek just the best\nqualities irrespective of gender, or race, or academic background,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThis being so, and because companies rightly want to reduce cost to hire, the\nfact early psychometrics offers a sifting and job suitability element in-one\nis hugely tempting.\u201d\n\nNot all agree \u2013 although not for the reason many might expect. \u201cAlthough the\nscience around psychometrics is proven, my concern is actually around how the\ncandidate experience is impacted,\u201d argues Andy Sumner, MD (UK) at Monster,\nwhich doesn't offer pre-application psychometric testing.\n\n\u201cWhat brands are effectively doing,\u201d he says, \u201cis asking people to do more,\nwhen candidates want to do less. Early psychometrics might be good for the\nemployer, but it\u2019s a candidate-driven market.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cYou have to wonder what candidates\u2019 reactions are going to be when\nthey\u2019re told they\u2019re not the right \u2018fit\u2019. Will they accept that a simple\npsychometric test tells a prospective employer everything about them? I\u2019m not\nsure they will.\u201d\n\n## Feedback on fit\n\nCompanies using early psychometrics include Vodafone and Accenture, but\naccording to Darby, psychometrics done well could actually boost the candidate\nexperience, by providing them with a much more detailed explanation of why the\nbrand thinks they\u2019re not for them. \u201cAt least jobseekers get feedback for the\ntime they\u2019ve invested,\u201d he says.\n\nAt Headstart AI, Jones says he\u2019s able to take this a step further, by\nsuggesting to jobseekers that while their profile may not fit the firm they\noriginally applied for, it does fit others it represents, and can forward\ntheir application to them instead. However, what is commonly agreed is that\nthe right psychometrics need to be chosen for the right reason.\n\n\u201cThe big caveat is that psychometrics must only support a robust job analysis\nexercise \u2013 and it\u2019s the latter that\u2019s just as important.\u201d says Darby. \u201cWhere\nfirms often go wrong is thinking they\u2019ve identified the best trait for a role\nbecause that\u2019s what\u2019s demonstrated by people they already have. But often,\nthese people have been influenced by bias, meaning this trait isn\u2019t at all\nwhat\u2019s important. It\u2019s establishing which trait you\u2019re measuring that really\nmatters.\u201d\n\nWhile there is widespread agreement that pre-interview psychometrics can be\nuseful, without following the chosen applicants long-term, how can it be\nproven that this type of selection works?\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s not well established is the extent to which psychometric profiling at\nan early stage validates people\u2019s performance later down the line,\u201d says Tom\nMarsden, CEO of Saberr, whose Saberr Base psychometric tool predicts cultural\nfit later on in the recruitment process.\u201d\n\nBut could this be changing too? Suzanne Courtney, MD at assessment specialist\ncut-e, says: \u201cWe use psychometrics early for the likes of EasyJet and Rolls\nRoyce because they hire grads, and at that age most haven\u2019t got proven work\nexperience, so there\u2019s a genuine need to assess potential.\u201d\n\nThis may go some way to address the future career question, she adds: \u201cWe now\nrun validation studies, with actual employees, to check that the behaviours we\nselect on do then follow through to outcomes.\u201d\n\n## Recruiting for retention\n\nAccording to Andy Gooday, managing director at Round Peg Search, which hires\nfor mid-level positions upwards in retail, the time has come for psychometric\nproviders to really press home its benefits: \u201cThe stats show 40-60% of hires\nfail because people leave after 18 to 24 months,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cLots of companies use cost to hire or time to hire metrics, but it\u2019s up to\npsychometric providers to push the retention of hires aspect instead. Because\nour tests measure the motivations people have for even applying in the first\nplace, we feel we\u2019re able to get to the heart of how the advertised job fits a\njobseekers\u2019 career aspirations.\u201d\n\nHe says that not only does this help clients find better candidates, but doing\nthe psychometrics first means employers can fine tune what they want to cover\nin the job interview.\n\nSaving psychometrics till the end is like taking whoever\u2019s left after an\ninterview process and trying to fit them against a profile that might be\ndifferent to what the interviewers were assessing on\" - Gareth Jones,\nHeadstart AI\n\nAll told, he believes the data proves the approach works. \u201cWe have 92%\nretention rates of people we place after two years,\u201d he says.\n\nBut should there still be a note of caution? Some argue there should. There\nare lots of different tools out there, and many counsel it\u2019s vital recruiters\nunderstand which psychometrics do what job: \u201cFor some roles, verbal and\nnumerical reasoning tests better predict performance, not personality\nprofiling,\u201d says Marsden. \u201cIf they want to use early psychometrics, it\u2019s\nessential HRDs understand what products to use to actually predict future\nperformance.\u201d Thinking of candidate experience, it\u2019s also vital jobseekers are\nexplained why a test fits a role.\n\n\u201cProduct choice can impact candidate experience,\u201d says Gooday. \u201cIt might not\nbe obvious why a numerical test fits with, say, a customer service role (which\nmight be the best test to use), which could leave job hunters less, not more\nengaged.\u201d\n\nHowever, Jones argues that any potential benefits really do outweigh the\npitfalls. In his previous role at Chemistry Group, which also offers clients\nearly psychometrics, SAP ended up finding candidates from a university it\nmight not have considered before because it wasn\u2019t considered a top-tier\nsource of graduates, all because of this early profiling.\n\nHe says: \u201cIt just shows that when you remove bias, you really can find the\nbest people from unexpected places.\u201d\n\nDr Mark Batey, senior lecturer in organisational psychology, Alliance\nManchester Business School, concludes that there will always be some bias,\nwhenever the employer decides to introduce psychometrics.\n\n\u201cBut, it is miniscule, and the amount of bias real people have is even\ngreater,\u201d he says. \u201cOn this basis alone, psychometrics should be used, as\nearly as possible in the process. HR and line managers may not want to, for\nfear it means their important judgement is being questioned, but you can\u2019t\nignore the fact it creates better diversity.\u201d\n\nHe offers a final note of caution, however: \u201cAnything that\u2019s subjective \u2013 like\nwhether someone has the right culture fit, should be left to as near the end\nof the process as possible \u2013 because that\u2019s where it creates the least\ndamage.\u201d\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/deliveroo-central-\narbitration-committee-cac-decision-riders-self-employed-worker-status/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/cipd-2017-might-missed-\nmanchester/)\n\n### 2 Responses to _Is testing candidates before they apply the future of\nrecruitment?_\n\n  1. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b9ddc0571b58d031dec25b8c48b5cdec?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\n\n[Tony Brown](http://www.peoplemaps.co.uk) 21 Nov 2017 at 1:32 pm\n[#](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/testing-candidates-apply-future-\nrecruitment/#comment-7979 \"Direct link to this comment\")\n\nWe can profile every candidate at point of application ,matching them against\nthe requirements of the role & environment.\n\nReply\n\n  2. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/057e2eb392b95a2ecfc9d32d554e3917?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\n\nNo Reply 1 May 2018 at 10:46 am [#](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/testing-\ncandidates-apply-future-recruitment/#comment-11711 \"Direct link to this\ncomment\")\n\nPsychometric testing is definitely a good tool at mid / end of process and\ndefinitely not at beginning.

Photograph: Alamy\n\n## **They're about discovering who you are**\n\n\"When people talk about psychometric tests, they sometimes mean\nquestionnaires,\" says [Mark\nParkinson](http://www.markparkinson.co.uk/index.htm), a business psychologist\nwho puts together both for organisations. \"A test is something with a right or\nwrong answer, which might be used to measure numeracy or literacy, for\nexample, while a questionnaire would be used to find out about someone's\npersonality.\" Employers may use one or both of these in the recruitment\nprocess.\n\nThe questionnaire is supposed to discover what kind of person you are in ways\nthat you wouldn't necessarily admit to in an interview, with questions\ndesigned to expose how you behave and what motivates you. A good test will be\nset up to pick up on any inconsistencies and make it difficult for you to put\non an act \u2013 there is a built-in \"lie scale\". An aptitude test is supposed to\nshow how good you are at tasks required in the job and may measure how quickly\nyou get to the right answer. The employer may have a minimum score you have to\nachieve, or be looking for the candidate with the best score, says Parkinson.\n\n## **They need to be part of a process**\n\n\"If you're recruiting for senior people these days, you will usually do\nsomething called an assessment centre \u2013 this will involve an interview, a work\nsampling and a psychometric test,\" says Cary Cooper, professor of\norganisational psychology and health at Lancaster University. \"An interview on\nits own is a very poor predicter of ultimate success.\"\n\nSo too are the other elements, when taken alone. For example, looking at the\nquality of someone's work, without knowing how they cope with decision-making,\nmakes it hard to know if they will be able to work in an environment where\nspeed is of the essence.\n\nParkinson says the results should always be validated at an interview. If\nsomeone comes across as sociable, they should be asked to give an example.\n\n## **They only work if the employer knows what they want**\n\nParkinson says they are only any good if the recruiter knows what they are\ntrying to measure and why. \"Where they often fail is when people try to use\nthem to assess things that you can't measure, such as creativity or\nleadership,\" he says. The recruiter needs to decide what kind of traits they\nthink make a good leader and look for those.\n\n## **You can't pass or fail a personality test**\n\n\"You can't actually 'ace' a psychometric test \u2013 the recruiter is using it to\nsee what your strengths and weaknesses are, and how they match up with the job\nrequirements,\" says Cooper. He points out that while for some roles, scoring\nhighly for sociability would be in your favour, if you were applying for a job\nauditing sensitive accounts or running a remote lighthouse, it might count\nagainst you.\n\nHowever, while the other elements of the recruitment process should be taken\ninto account, it could be that the employer is looking for particular results\nin the test, and rejects candidates who don't fit the bill. You won't have\nfailed the test as such, but you won't get the job.\n\n## **They have a dark side**\n\nSome questonnaires now try and establish the \"dark side\" of your personality\nand how traits might be displayed if things go wrong and you find yourself\nunder pressure. Arguably, Co-op Bank's recruiters should have used this one.\n\nTopics\n\n  * [ Work & careers ](https://www.theguardian.com/money/work-and-careers)\n  * [ Shortcuts

To do this successfully, managers need to inspire and motivate\ntheir teams and provide a positive, psychologically safe employee experience.\nThis is important because with the war for talent raging, organizations can\u2019t\nafford to lose top performers. Motivated and engaged teams with a high degree\nof psychological safety are more likely to perform at a higher standard, and\nless likely to quit.\n\nIn a recent study, CareerBuilder found that 58 percent of managers never\nactually receive any formal management training. When you consider that\ntraining helps managers develop critical skills that promote a positive\nemployee experience, it\u2019s not hard to see why there\u2019s a disconnect between\nwhat companies need to do to retain top talent and the training they\u2019re\nwilling to provide to their managers to make that happen. With that in mind,\nhere are three areas managers can focus on to ensure they\u2019re creating\nproductive teams and retaining top talent.\n\n### Psychologically safe environments\n\nAs leaders, managers have to hold people accountable for performance metrics,\nbut the job doesn\u2019t end there. In this talent-strapped market, they must also\nmaintain an exceptional employee experience by creating a people-first\nenvironment where employees feel empowered to take risks and are engaged. This\nis where psychological safety comes into play. According to Amy Edmondson, a\nHarvard Business School researcher, psychological safety \u201cdescribes\nperceptions of the consequences of taking interpersonal risks in a particular\ncontext such as a workplace.\"\n\nFor example, a manager might produce a psychologically unsafe environment by\nnot encouraging their employees to share their opinions, which could lead to\nanxiety and low productivity within the team. On the other hand, managers can\ncreate a psychologically safe environment by engaging their teams in decision\nmaking and focusing on finding solutions instead of Placing blame. When put\ninto a psychologically safe environment, employee performance will improve,\nand loyalty and productivity will increase.\n\nWhile developing a psychologically safe environment may seem like common\nsense, it requires constant intentionality. Managers must maintain a system of\nchecks and balances to ensure that the positive environment they are\ngenerating remains intact and evolves as the team does. With the war for\ntalent raging, establishing a psychologically safe work environment is\ncritical to retaining top performers and avoiding a revolving door of new\nhires.\n\n### The importance of team building\n\nAccording to a recent survey, the number one skill employees believe that\nmanagers lack is team building. Team building is important for creating the\nkinds of interpersonal relationships that allow teams to thrive and work\ncohesively to deliver business results. Successful teams are comprised of\nself-aware team members who are purposeful about their interactions, mindful\nof behavioral differences, and communicate effectively with each other.\n\nThe biggest thing that managers need to remember is that it takes time and\nconsistency for team building to be effective. Similar to creating a\npsychologically safe environment, the benefits of team building are not\ninstantaneous. Having teams participate in a variety of projects with clearly\ndefined roles will help managers see increased motivation and collaboration,\nand improved productivity over time. Beyond workplace assignments, offering\nopportunities for employees to get to know each other past the typical daily\nroutine opens up trust and communication for colleagues to work more\ncohesively across the office.\n\n### Utilizing people data\n\nWhen behavioral assessments are used to collect people data either pre- or\npost-hire, the manager ratings tend to be higher. This may be because\nbehavioral assessments help managers understand how individuals are wired to\nthink and work, allowing them to hone the \u201csofter\u201d requirements of a\nmanagerial position. People data contributes to greater self-awareness and can\nbe leveraged to improve working relationships and to tailor coaching according\nto individual preferences. For example, managers might have a team member\nwhose innate drive creates a need to avoid making mistakes. They will want to\nunderstand expectations and the right way to get the job done. Managers can\nutilize the data in this case to put an emphasis on structure, process and\nsystems.\n\nPeople data can also be useful when it comes to team building. When looking\nfor the right hire, people data can be used to inform everything from how to\nassemble the right personalities to get the most out of a team, and how to\nbest encourage an employee and provide them with the appropriate support. Over\ntime, this will help companies build successful, high-performing teams which\nwill translate into higher company revenue.\n\n### The broader business benefits\n\nWhen managers are able to proactively diagnose issues contributing to low\nmorale and decreased productivity, they are able to help maintain a strong\ncompany culture. Creating a psychologically safe environment, incorporating\nteam building and appropriately using people data are all factors that add to\ndeveloping and maintaining a culture that employees want to stay in for the\nlong term. Following these guidelines allows companies to save time and money\nby stopping the revolving door and maintaining a high success rate.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Employee

Many of these technologies promise to\nhelp organizations improve their ability to find the right person for the\nright job, and screen out the wrong people for the wrong jobs, faster and\ncheaper than ever before. In particular, there's been rapid growth (and\ncorresponding venture capital investment) in game-based assessments, bots for\nscraping social media postings, linguistic analysis of candidates' writing\nsamples, and video-based interviews that utilize algorithms to analyze speech\ncontent, tone of voice, emotional states, nonverbal behaviors, and\ntemperamental clues. While these novel tools are disrupting the recruitment\nand assessment space, they leave many yet-unanswered questions about their\naccuracy, and the ethical, legal, and privacy implications that they\nintroduce.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/04/Apr19_25_936081476.jpg) Peter\nDazeley/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2019/04/the-legal-and-ethical-implications-of-using-ai-in-\nhiring?language=es)\n\nDigital innovations and advances in AI have produced a range of [novel talent\nidentification and assessment](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/new-ways-\nto-gauge-talent-and-potential/) tools. Many of these technologies promise to\nhelp organizations improve their ability to find the right person for the\nright job, and screen out the wrong people for the wrong jobs, faster and\ncheaper than ever before.\n\nThese tools put unprecedented power in the hands of organizations to pursue\ndata-based human capital decisions.  They also have the potential to\ndemocratize feedback, giving millions of job candidates data-driven insights\non their strengths, development needs, and potential career and organizational\nfit. In [particular](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/industrial-and-\norganizational-psychology/article/new-talent-signals-shiny-new-objects-or-a-\nbrave-new-world/B301CCE93DDCFC658257E36B80B5E695), we have seen the rapid\ngrowth (and corresponding venture capital investment) in game-based\nassessments, bots for scraping social media postings, linguistic analysis of\ncandidates\u2019 writing samples, and video-based interviews that utilize\nalgorithms to analyze speech content, tone of voice, emotional states,\nnonverbal behaviors, and temperamental clues.\n\n#### Insight Center\n\n  * ###### [Interacting with AI](/insight-center/interacting-with-ai)\n\nSponsored by Qlik\n\nHow humans and machines will work together.\n\nWhile these novel tools are disrupting the recruitment and assessment space,\nthey leave many yet-unanswered questions about their accuracy, and the\nethical, legal, and privacy implications that they introduce.  This is\nespecially true when compared to more longstanding psychometric assessments\nsuch as the NEO-PI-R, The Wonderlic Test, the Ravens Progressive Matrices\ntest, or the Hogan Personality Inventory that have been [scientifically\nderived](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3200/6/4/49) and carefully validated vis-a-\nvis relevant jobs, identifying reliable associations between applicants\u2019\nscores and their subsequent job performance (publishing the evidence in\nindependent, trustworthy, scholarly journals).  Recently, there has even been\ninterest and concern in the U.S. Senate about whether new technologies\n(specifically, facial analysis technologies) might have negative implications\nfor [equal\nopportunity](https://www.scribd.com/embeds/388920670/content#from_embed) among\njob candidates.\n\nIn this article, we focus on the potential repercussions of new technologies\non the privacy of job candidates, as well as the implications for candidates\u2019\nprotections under the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://www.ada.gov/)\nand other federal and state employment laws. Employers recognize that they\ncan\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t ask candidates about their family status or political\norientation, or whether they are pregnant, straight, gay, sad, lonely,\ndepressed, physically or mentally ill, drinking too much, abusing drugs, or\nsleeping too little. However, [new\ntechnologies](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802) may already be able to\ndiscern many of these factors indirectly and without proper (or even any)\nconsent.\n\nBefore delving into the current ambiguities of the brave new world of job\ncandidate assessment and evaluation, it\u2019s helpful to take a look at the past.\n[Psychometric assessments](/2013/09/how-to-use-psychometric-testin) have been\nin use for well over 100 years, and became more widely utilized as a result of\nthe United States Military\u2019s [Army\nAlpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Alpha), which placed recruits into\ncategories and determined their likelihood of being successful in various\nroles. Traditionally, psychometrics fell into three broad categories:\ncognitive ability or intelligence, personality or temperament, and mental\nhealth or clinical diagnosis.\n\nSince the adoption of the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in\n1990,](https://www.ada.gov/) employers are generally forbidden from inquiring\nabout and/or using physical disability, mental health, or clinical diagnosis\nas a factor in pre-employment candidate assessments, and companies that have\ndone so have been sued and censured. In essence, disabilities \u2014 whether\nphysical or mental \u2014 have been determined to be \u201cprivate\u201d information that\nemployers cannot inquire about at the pre-employment stage, just as employers\nshouldn\u2019t ask applicants intrusive questions about their private lives, and\ncannot take private demographic information into account in hiring decisions.\n\nCognitive ability and intelligence testing have been found to be a [reliable\nand valid](https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/individual-differences-as-\npredictors-of-work-educational-and-broa) predictor of job success in a wide\nvariety of occupations. However, these kinds of assessments can be\ndiscriminatory if they adversely impact certain [protected\ngroups](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6371/10a534c2ab79c0695b8f5c190ab76669d122.pdf),\nsuch as those defined by gender, race, age, or national origin. If an employer\nis utilizing an assessment that has been found to have such an [adverse\nimpact](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2014-title29-vol4/xml/CFR-2014-title29-vol4-part1607.xml),\nwhich is defined by the relative scores of different protected groups, the\nemployer has to prove that the assessment methodology is job-related and\npredictive of success in the specific jobs in question.\n\nPersonality assessments are less likely to expose employers to possible\nliability for discrimination, since there is little to no correlation between\npersonality characteristics and protected demographic variables or\ndisabilities. It should also be noted that the relationship between\npersonality and job performance depends on the\n[context](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10822959_Using_Theory_to_Evaluate_Personality_and_Job-\nPerformance_Relations) (e.g., type of role or job).\n\nUnfortunately, there is far less information about the new generation of\ntalent tools that are increasingly used in pre-hire assessment. Many of these\ntools have emerged as technological innovations, rather than from\nscientifically-derived methods or research programs.  As a result, it is not\nalways clear what they assess, whether their underlying hypotheses are valid,\nor why they may be expected to predict job candidates\u2019 performance. For\nexample, physical properties of speech and the human voice \u2014 which have long\nbeen associated with elements of\n[personality](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1972.tb00998.x)\n\u2014 have been linked to individual differences in job performance.  If a tool\nshows a preference for speech patterns such as consistent vocal cadence or\npitch or a \u201cfriendly\u201d tone of voice that do not have an adverse impact upon\njob candidates in a legally protected group, then there is no legal issue; but\nthese tools may not have been scientifically validated and therefore are not\ncontrolling for potential discriminatory adverse impact \u2014 meaning the employer\nmay incur liability for any blind reliance.  In addition, there are yet no\nconvincing hypotheses or defensible conclusions about whether it would be\n[ethical](/2015/04/should-your-voice-determine-whether-you-get-hired) to\nscreen out people based on their voices, which are physiologically determined,\nlargely unchangeable personal attributes.\n\nLikewise, social media activity \u2014 e.g., Facebook or Twitter usage \u2014 has been\nfound to reflect people\u2019s [intelligence and\npersonality](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/15/5802), including their [dark\nside\ntraits](http://www.academia.edu/36733338/Personality_and_Individual_Differences_Detecting_the_dark_side_of_personality_using_social_media_status_updates).\nBut is it ethical to mine this data for hiring purposes when users will have\ngenerally used such apps for different purposes and may not have provided\ntheir consent for data analysis to draw private conclusions from their public\npostings?\n\nWhen used in the hiring context, new technologies raise a number of new\nethical and legal questions around privacy, which we think ought to be\npublicly discussed and debated, namely:\n\n_1) What temptations will companies face in terms of candidate privacy\nrelating to personal attributes?_\n\nAs technology advances, big data and AI will continue to be able to determine\n\u201cproxy\u201d variables for private, personal attributes with increased accuracy.\nToday, for example, Facebook \u201clikes\u201d can be used to\n[infer](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/110/15/5802.full.pdf) sexual\norientation and race with considerable accuracy. Political affiliation and\nreligious beliefs are just as easily identifiable. Might companies be tempted\nto use tools like these to screen candidates, believing that because decisions\naren\u2019t made directly based upon protected characteristics that they aren\u2019t\nlegally actionable?  While an employer may not violate any laws in merely\ndiscerning an applicant\u2019s personal information, the company may become\nvulnerable to legal exposure if it makes adverse employment decisions by\nrelying on any protected categories such as one\u2019s place of birth, race, or\nnative language \u2014 or based on private information that it does not have the\nright to consider, such as possible physical illness or mental ailment.  How\nthe courts will handle situations where employers have relied upon tools using\nthese proxy variables is unclear; but the fact remains that it is unlawful to\ntake an adverse action based upon certain protected or private characteristics\n\u2014 no matter how these were learned or inferred.\n\nThis might also apply to facial recognition software, as recent\n[research](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/12/artificial-\nintelligence-face-recognition-michal-kosinski) predicts that face-reading AI\nmay soon be able to discern candidates\u2019 sexual and political orientation as\nwell as \u201cinternal states\u201d like mood or emotion with a high degree of accuracy.\nHow might the application of the [Americans with Disabilities\nAct](https://adata.org/learn-about-ada) change? Additionally, the [Employee\nPolygraph Protection\nAct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Polygraph_Protection_Act)\ngenerally prohibits employers from using lie detector tests as a pre-\nemployment screening tool and the [Genetic Information Nondiscrimination\nAct](https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/gina.cfm) prohibits employers from\nusing genetic information in employment decisions. But what if the exact same\nkind of information about truth, lies, or genetic attributes can be determined\nby the above-mentioned technological tools?\n\n_2) What temptations will companies face in terms of candidate privacy\nrelating to lifestyle and activities?_\n\nEmployers can now access information such as one candidate\u2019s online \u201ccheck in\u201d\nto her church every Sunday morning, another candidate\u2019s review of the dementia\ncare facility into which he has checked his elderly parent, and a third\u2019s\ndivorce filing in civil court.  All of these things, and many more, are easily\ndiscoverable in the digital era. Big data is following us everywhere we go\nonline and collecting and assembling information that can be sliced and diced\nby tools we can\u2019t even imagine yet \u2014 tools that could possibly inform future\nemployers about our fitness (or lack thereof) for certain roles.  And big data\nis only going to get bigger; according to experts, [90% of the data in the\nworld](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-\nwe-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/#5ee7411b60ba)\nwas generated just in the past two years alone.  With the expansion of data\ncomes the potential expansion for misuse and resulting discrimination \u2014 either\ndeliberate or unintentional.\n\nUnlike the EU, which has harmonized its approach to privacy under the General\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR), the U.S. relies on a patchwork approach to\nprivacy driven largely by state law.  With regard to social media,\nspecifically, states began introducing legislation back in 2012 to prevent\nemployers from requesting passwords to personal internet accounts as a\ncondition of employment.  More than twenty states have enacted these types of\nlaws that apply to employers.  However, in terms of general privacy in the use\nof new technologies in the workplace, there has been less specific guidance or\naction. In particular, [legislation has passed in California](/2018/07/what-\nyou-need-to-know-about-californias-new-data-privacy-law) that will potentially\nconstrain employers\u2019 use of candidate or employee data. In general, state and\nfederal courts have yet to adopt a unified framework for analyzing employee\nprivacy as related to new technology.  The takeaway is that at least for now,\nemployee privacy in the age of big data remains unsettled. This puts employers\nin a conflicted position that calls out for caution: Cutting-edge technology\nis available that may be extremely useful. But it\u2019s giving you information\nthat has previously been considered private. Is it legal to use in a hiring\ncontext? And is it ethical to consider if the candidate didn\u2019t consent?\n\n_3) What temptations will companies face in terms of candidate privacy\nrelating to disabilities?_\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act puts mental disabilities squarely in its\npurview, alongside physical disabilities, and defines an individual as\ndisabled if the impairment substantially limits a major life activity, if the\nperson has a record of such an impairment, or if the person is perceived to\nhave such an impairment. About a decade ago, The U.S. Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) issued guidance to say that the expanding list\nof personality disorders described in the psychiatric literature could qualify\nas mental impairments, and the ADA Amendments Act made it easier for an\nindividual to establish that he or she has a disability within the meaning of\nthe ADA. As a result, the category of people protected under the ADA may now\ninclude people who have significant problems communicating in social\nsituations, people who have issues concentrating, or people who have\ndifficulty interacting with others.\n\nIn addition to raising new questions about disabilities, technology also\npresents new dilemmas with respect to differences, whether demographic or\notherwise. There have already been high-profile real-life situations where\nthese systems have revealed learned biases, especially relating to race and\ngender. Amazon, for example, developed an automated talent search program to\nreview resumes \u2014 which was abandoned once the company realized that [the\nprogram was not rating candidates in a gender-neutral\nway](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-\ninsight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-\nwomen-idUSKCN1MK08G). To reduce such biases, developers are balancing the data\nused for training AI models, to appropriately represent all groups. The more\ninformation that the technology has and can account for/learn from, the better\nit can control for potential bias.\n\nIn conclusion, new technologies can already cross the lines between public and\nprivate attributes, \u201ctraits\u201d and \u201cstates\u201d in new ways, and there is every\nreason to believe that in the future they will be increasingly able to do so.\nUsing AI, big data, social media, and machine learning, employers will have\never-greater access to candidates\u2019 private lives, private attributes, and\nprivate challenges and states of mind. There are no easy answers to many of\nthe new questions about privacy we have raised here, but we believe that they\nare all worthy of public discussion and debate.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2012/03/110-Ben_Dattner.jpg)\n\n[Ben Dattner](/search?term=ben%20dattner&search_type=search-all) is an\nexecutive coach and organizational development consultant, and the founder of\nNew York City-based [Dattner Consulting,\nLLC](http://www.dattnerconsulting.com/).

With a\nheavy emphasis on technology and process efficiency, he says organisations can\nrisk losing their way and getting psychometrics wrong.  \n  \n\"HR departments are correctly looking to improve process efficiency, and are\nincreasingly looking to Automated Tracking Systems to control process flow,\"\nRuhfus explains. \"However, they don't do any of the heavy lifting\npsychometrics do, and it can be a case of technology wagging the dog to try\nand make it all work.\"  \n  \nThe problem with process efficiency alone is it can prioritise the wrong\nthings. While trying to save on costs, HR can actually end up entrenching\nselection errors.  \n  \n\"Sometimes, there is confusion about what assessment methods to use at what\nphase of the selection process,\" Ruhfus explains. \"In graduate selection, for\nexample, aptitude tests are commonly used as an early screen. Over-reliance on\nthis method can mean you lose candidates with other outstanding qualities like\nbuilding relationships, influencing outcomes, and driving results.\" With the\nnew breed of behavioural-style questionnaires like Wave\u2122 and its screening\ncounterpart Work Strengths, Ruhfus says combining aptitude and behavioural\nassessments at the beginning of the screening process makes more sense.  \n  \n**What to use**  \nCognitive ability testing, otherwise known as aptitude testing, has been the\njewel in the crown of psychometric testing science. That's because research\nhas shown for a long time that test scores correlate well with actual\nperformance on the job across all jobs. While it does work better for more\ncomplex jobs - such as managers and professionals - it is still predictive for\nlower-level jobs as well.  \n  \nThis is backed by the most recent research by Saville Consulting on\nbehavioural-style assessment (measuring propensities towards certain kinds of\nbehaviour and styles of interaction with others). Together, they do the 'heavy\nlifting' in quality assessment. \"Both have demonstrated pulling power and are\ncheap and efficient,\" Ruhfus says.  \n  \nThere are new and growing trends. Situational judgement tests, for example,\nask candidates to respond to tailored scenarios and are increasingly being\nused strategically to project organisational branding in front-end screening.\n\"For example, they can include things like a full video portrayal of a\nsituation, which can be very lifelike. It's an interesting task for a\ncandidate to do and has respectable validity, though not as good as aptitude\nand behavioural tests.\"  \n  \nThen there's gamification, which turns more standard testing into animated\nproblems and scenarios in a way that is said to appeal more to Gen Y\ncandidates. While it's fashionable and holds potential, Ruhfus says HR\nprofessionals should be cautious. \"I haven't seen any compelling evidence for\ntheir validity to date. The literature kind of says, 'Good idea, keep working\non this, it makes sense', but I don't think we've actually cracked it yet.\"  \n  \nSome gamified products have even gone \"backwards\" in time with \"quite trivial\nsorts of questions\" that are not job relevant, Ruhfus says, which may be an HR\n\"backlash waiting to happen\". He says to ask for proof. \"They may be a new,\nsexy and fun way of testing, but where is the job relevance in them?\"  \n  \n**When to use it**  \nDue to the low cost of testing compared with return on investment, Ruhfus says\ntesting is best deployed as early as possible. \"We have now made tests\nextremely accessible at a fraction of the cost. They should really be used\nmore up front, and they should be testing more people. The more people you can\nsurvey, the better the return on investment and outcome for a company.\" Ruhfus\nactually trains HR practitioners to evaluate tests and understand the\nfinancial impact they can make if used properly.  \n  \nIn practice, psychometrics are not always used this way. Ruhfus gives the\nexample of continued reliance by many on interviewing at the front end.\n\"Interviewing is very time-consuming because you usually need busy people to\ndo it, so it is actually a significant cost internally to organisations.\"\nOften, this means an hour or more of management time is wasted when, \"in many\ncases, a candidate could already have told you that they are not for you\nthrough more efficient testing\".  \n  \nAn added bonus is that the best tests are 'blind' to common biases that work\nagainst organisational performance. \"They are relatively blind to things like\ngender, ethnicity and age. Many companies are moving away from more\ntraditional approaches because they are not getting enough good people.\nTesting now has the potential to turn that on its head. Testing is being used\nto increase diversity and inclusion and doesn't have the sort of unconscious\nbiases we all have as managers,\" he says.  \n\n\n**CAN CANDIDATES 'GAME' A PSYCHOMETRIC TEST?**  \nInfluencing the results of a psychometric test - through outright lying or\n'impression managing' - is a possibility. So is getting a smart cousin to\ncomplete an aptitude test for you, particularly in an age when tests are\nperformed online. Scott Ruhfus says there are ways to mitigate these risks.  \n  \n1) A supervised test: A shortlist of candidates can be retested under\nsupervised conditions. Saville, for example, offers parallel versions of the\nsame test, to allow comparison under supervised conditions.  \n  \n2) Get professional: Recent developments in personality assessment have found\nbetter ways to combat impression management, which actually home in on the\nareas where distortion is likely to have occurred. This allows practitioners\nto target probing follow-up questions,  \n  \nFor those who think interviewing will yield a more truthful gauge of a\ncandidate, think again. \"Research shows 97% of candidates lie during an\ninterview, or in some way distort the truth,\" Ruhfus says.\n\n  \n**How to use it**  \nThe effectiveness of psychometric testing comes down to getting the highest\n'validity', or the extent to which results correlate with the outcome HR\nwants. Ultimately, this means scores that predict job performance. For\nexample, a heavy reliance on resume culling actually has low validity, in that\nit is much less effective than psychometric testing in predicting job\nperformance.  \n  \nConfusion can arise when test results conflict with what a manager believes\nbased on an interview, Ruhfus says. For example, a manager may claim the\nresults of aptitude are 'wrong' based on their interview impression, which is\nheavily influenced by social rather than cognitive factors. HR practitioners\nsometimes don't know how to address this apparent quandary. \"The best kind of\ninterview done by the best kind of interviewer makes at least as many mistakes\nas a test, and the truth is, you don't actually get to see the job performance\nof the people that you end up rejecting,\" he says. Everyone thinks they are a\ngood interviewer, but the research is unequivocal. Ruhfus says aptitude\ntesting combined with a good interview allows you to achieve incremental\nimprovements in validity, compared to interviewing alone.  \n  \nOrganisations can also go wrong before they even start if they fail to do a\nproper 'job analysis', to set the right parameters for testing.  \n  \nCompetency frameworks are important to organisations, and help to underpin\nchange initiatives. However, Ruhfus says they are often implemented without an\neye to assessment. He recommends organisations consult an experienced\nspecialist before developing in-house competencies and assessment criteria.  \n  \n**The future**  \nTechnology will play an increasing role in testing in future - as long as it\nis used effectively. \"I think psychometrics will be intimately connected with\ntechnology, because it is a way to deliver testing efficiently and in an\nattractive way. Down the track, things like gamification could well have\nlegs.\"  \n  \nRuhfus has already introduced a range of virtual assessment centre exercises -\nVirtual AC\u2122 - into the assessment mix.  \n  \nAnd while Ruhfus expects continued development in areas as cutting-edge as\niris identification technology to stamp out cheats, and one day perhaps even\nthe exploration of genetic testing, HR managers will still need to know when\nto show a human touch.  \n  \n\"In the end, you want to attract the good candidates to you instead of your\ncompetitors, and you have to impress them as much as they need to impress you.\nTo do that, you need to spend quality time with the most suitable candidates.\nThe question really is, what is the optimal point at which to do that, and how\ncan we get those good candidates in front of a hiring manager sooner rather\nthan later.\"  \n\n\n**ESSENTIAL STATS**  \n**30%** - Increase in revenue achievable by managing talent against validated\nbehavioural fit equations  \n  \n**40%** - Typical cost of recruitment error as a percentage of annual salary  \n  \n**50%** - The increase in validity achieved by changing from a test with a\nvalidity of 0.4 to one of 0.6.

From\ntheir early application in educational psychology to their widespread use by\norganizations in their various HR processes, we have come a long way. Today,\nin India alone, over 74% of companies use assessments in their recruitment\nprocess2.\n\nBut despite the growing trust and popularity, psychometric assessments are not\nutilized to their full potential. If utilized through the right approach,\npsychometric assessments can enable HR to fulfill a myriad of HR objectives\nranging from evaluating complex profiles with customized competencies,\nrevealing hidden facets of personality, predicting work-behavior and job\nperformance, gauging fitment in a specific work culture, etc. However, these\nobjectives are difficult to attain with the current method of using a single\nassessment in each evaluation process.\n\nTo effectively fulfill such objectives, HR professionals need to adopt the\nmulti-criteria approach, which is the process of combining complementary tests\nresults together for a more comprehensive, accurate, and predictive analysis\nof an individual. The idea is to consider beforehand, the different criteria\nof assessment expectations in terms of behavioral competencies, job fitment,\nculture fit, etc. A Harvard Business School study3 shows that the combined use\nof personality and intelligence tests increase recruitment-efficiency by 15%\ncompared to a non-test recruitment process. For example, with the multi-\ncriteria approach, the HR can combine a cognitive ability test, sales aptitude\ntest, and emotional intelligence test for a more precise and predictive\nevaluation to successfully hire a sales team manager.\n\nBut the implementation of the multi-criteria approach can be easier said than\ndone. For starters, when combining complementary test results, the assessor\nneeds to juggle different assessment reports to obtain one definitive\nanalysis. And there can also be the need to assess added competencies, compare\nmultiple candidates, etc. When done manually, all this can become a daunting,\ncomplicated, and long-drawn exercise.\n\nThis is where HR professionals can use the TALENT MATCHER, which automates the\nimplementation of the multi-criteria approach. Developed by Central Test (a\nleading psychometric assessment publisher), the TALENT MATCHER is an advanced\npredictive matching feature that harnesses the power of Smart Data algorithm\nwith the multi-criteria approach to identify the most suitable candidates,\nmatching them with the requirements of specific job roles, functions and\noverall work culture. The TALENT MATCHER also allows to accurately anticipate\ntalent and potentials of each candidate. Further, it can present a comparison\nbetween multiple candidates to explore their key differences on the various\nbehavioral competencies and job roles.\n\n> Psychometric assessments combined with Smart Data algorithm to give HR\n> professionals the power to accurately predict talent and potential.\n\nThe TALENT MATCHER is designed to boost the overall success of your assessment\ncampaigns by making the evaluation process more efficient, effective, and\nsimple. It is available within the Central Test\u2019s online assessment platform\nand a free demo can be requested on the

Leaders may question the purpose of\nparticipating when they are skeptical about seeing meaningful returns, but\ndevelopment efforts are most effective when the individual is a willing\nparticipant.\n\nI've found that basing development plans around psychometric assessments to be\nthe most effective route towards earning buy-in from the leader and developing\nthe best action plan. Scientifically valid assessments are effective at\nidentifying the strengths and blind spots of leaders, and often help coaches\nstart potentially tough conversations with clients. Perhaps the leader you're\nworking with is skilled at developing and executing plans to move the business\nforward, but they aren't as strong with their relationship-building skills and\nare completely unaware of this challenge. Psychometric assessments can help\nyou start that conversation by constructively revealing those blind spots.\n\n**What will be the key qualities of an effective leader in 2018?**  \nThe top leadership quality for 2018 will be selfawareness. Self-awareness is\nthe foundation for much of quality leadership. If a leader does not accept\ntheir strengths and weaknesses, they will face many challenges that will\nhinder their success. I find that 360-degree feedback assessments greatly help\nleaders improve their self-awareness.\n\nThe concept of the empathetic leader is currently a popular trend and will\ncontinue to be so in 2018. The ability to lead diverse groups is an\nincreasingly important skill to have, and the ability to empathize with\ndifferent individuals will impact one's ability to lead these diverse groups.\nConnecting these qualities together: Even if you think you're empathizing with\nthe needs of your team or organization, do they feel the same?\n\n**Do you have any tips for leaders on how they can inspire others in 2018?**  \nOne tip would be to engage in more coaching initiatives. For example, when\nproviding feedback to direct reports, focus on ways they can grow as a\ncontributor, instead of how they can change their methods to better fit into\nthe organization's desired procedures. This will inspire your team to continue\nharnessing their strengths, and they will be more receptive to ideas for\ngrowth. Also, you will begin to discover the unique views, skills and insights\nthat your direct reports bring to the team, getting to know them better.\n\nAnother tip would be to provide your team with clear outcomes to aim for, but\ngrant them the freedom to accomplish tasks however they see fit. This ensures\nthat everyone is working towards the same goal, but it shows that you trust\nthem enough to use their judgment to reach the goal.\n\n![](https://ca.res.keymedia.com/files/image/justin%20deonarine.PNG)\n\n### Most

claim was brought by an aspiring lawyer, Ms Brookes, who has Asperger's\nsyndrome.\n\nShe applied for a job as a trainee solicitor with the Government Legal Service\n(GLS).\n\nEach year, the GLS receives thousands of applications for a small number of\ntrainee solicitor posts.\n\nThe \"fiendishly competitive\" recruitment process starts with an online\n\"situational judgment test\" (SJT), which uses multiple-choice questions to\ntest candidates' ability to make effective decisions.\n\nMs Brookes asked the GLS if she could submit her answers in a short narrative\nform because of her condition. However, she was told that an alternative test\nformat was not available.\n\nMs Brookes completed the SJT in its multiple-choice format, but she scored 12\nout of 22. The pass mark to proceed to the next stage of the recruitment\nprocess was 14.\n\nUnusually, her employment tribunal case included a claim for indirect\ndisability discrimination. The employment tribunal accepted that the multiple-\nchoice format put her at a particular because of her condition.\n\nHer condition meant that she \"lacked social imagination and would have\ndifficulties in imaginative and counter-factual reasoning in hypothetical\nscenarios\".\n\n## Indirect disability discrimination: EAT's view\n\n\"The tribunal was presented with what appeared to be a capable young woman\nwho, with the benefit of adjustments, had obtained a law degree and had come\nclose to reaching the required mark of 14 in the SJT, but had not quite\nmanaged it.\n\n\"The tribunal was right to ask itself why, and was entitled to find that a\nlikely explanation could be found in the fact that she had Asperger\u2019s, and the\nadditional difficulty that would place her under due to the multiple choice\nformat of the SJT.\"\n\nThe tribunal accepted that the assessment had the legitimate aim of testing a\nfundamental competency.\n\nHowever, the tribunal concluded that the means of achieving the aim were not\nproportionate because an alternative assessment method, suggested by Ms\nBrookes, was available.\n\nThe GLS appealed against the tribunal decision, with EAT agreeing\nwholeheartedly with the first-instance tribunal's finding of indirect\ndisability discrimination.\n\nThe appeal tribunal held that the test placed Ms Brookes at a particular\ndisadvantage compared with non-disabled candidates who do not have Asperger's\nsyndrome.\n\nThe EAT accepted that her condition had affected her ability to complete the\nmultiple-choice assessment, and that the GLS should have adapted the test for\nher.\n\nThe EAT also agreed with the employment tribunal that the GLS had committed\ndiscrimination arising from disability and failed to comply with its duty to\nmake reasonable adjustments.\n\nStephen Simpson, principal employment law editor at XpertHR, commented on the\nunusual nature of the claim: \"Indirect disability discrimination claims are\nexceptionally rare. These days, most claimants will allege discrimination\narising from disability and failure to make reasonable adjustments. Both of\nthese are generally seen as easier to win.\n\n\"The fact that the claimant won under all three headings highlights the need\nfor recruiters to be flexible in their assessment methods for disabled\napplicants. In some cases, the format of the assessment may need to be\naltered.\"\n\nThe tribunal made a recommendation that the GLS issue a written apology to her\nand review its recruitment procedures for disabled job applicants, with a view\nto introducing greater flexibility in its psychometric testing.\n\nMs Brookes was also awarded \u00a3860 in compensation.\n\n[**More on the EAT decision in _Government Legal Service v Brookes_ ,\nincluding an analysis of its implications for employers, is available on\nXpertHR.**](http://www.xperthr.co.uk/law-reports/recruitment-and-disability-\nonline-multiple-choice-psychometric-test-was-indirectly-\ndiscriminatory/162106/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/six-ways-every-employer-\nusing-video-demand-webinar/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/neil-morrison-leaves-penguin-\nrandom-house-severn-trent/)\n\n### 2 Responses to _Recruitment: psychometric test was discriminatory, holds\nEAT_\n\n  1. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c934f5df018c6dbc9d1dd7dd56a877a3?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\n\nTerri Brookes 9 May 2017 at 7:40 am\n[#](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/recruitment-multiple-choice-\npsychometric-test-discriminatory-holds-eat/#comment-2705 \"Direct link to this\ncomment\")\n\nPeople seem to be under the impression I was at Sussex Uni when this case\nstarted.

comment\n\nPsychometrics can be used as part of coaching to make the whole process even\nmore effective. Follow these 15 simple steps to get the most out of your\ncoaches and coachees.\n\nCoaching is a [growing\narea](http://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/hro/features/1147184/demonstrating-\neffectiveness-coaching). What was once a privilege for a select few is\nbecoming a mainstream activity in organisations regardless of size, sector or\nseniority. More and more companies and coaches are using psychometrics during\ncoaching too. Mark Batey, head of global open programmes at Manchester\nBusiness School shares his 15 steps for success in using psychometrics in\ncoaching.\n\n**Pre-coaching**\n\n1\\. _Establish a psychometrics policy_. Make it transparent how psychometrics\nwill be chosen, how they will be used and build trust in the process by\nexplaining the confidentiality relating to data and any written reports.\n\n2\\. _Identify objectives.  _These may be the goals of the organisation, but\nwill often include individual or team objectives as well.\n\n3\\. _Understand the coachee._  Choosing the best psychometric and/or coach\nshould start with the [needs, orientations and objectives of the\ncoachee](http://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/hr/features/1145547/coaching-favourite).\nHave they been through the process before? What is their existing\nunderstanding?\n\n4\\. _Choose psychometric tools.  _Try to find a balance between the quality of\nthe tool (reliability, validity, fairness) and the needs of the coachee. The\nmost comprehensive tool (or the simplest) is not always the best.\n\n5\\. _Choose a practitioner._  It is essential that the practitioner is\ncompetent, genuinely understands the tool (there are many people out there who\nhave been trained, but never used a measure in practice) and credible to the\ncoachee.\n\n6\\. _Preparation_. Build trust in the process. Clearly signpost what tool is\nbeing used, how and why. The best coaches use a mixture of pre-planned\nquestions and flexibility during the coaching sessions. The aim of the\npreparation is to ensure that coachees understand what is happening and why.\n\n**During Coaching**\n\n7.  _Introduction.  _It is essential to provide a thorough introduction prior to using psychometrics in coaching. Use this time to set the coachee at ease, deal with any pre-conceptions and review objectives and how the session will be used.\n\n8\\. _Presenting results.  _The style should be professional, considerate,\nempathetic, but also objective and challenging. Some coaches present a blank\nprofile of the results and ask the coachee to fill it in as they go through\nthe interpretation process. Others share the complete results, while others\nwill provide narrative feedback and not show any of the printouts or outputs\nto the coachee.\n\n9\\. _Feedback structure.  _Some coachees will respond positively to a highly\nstructured approach with a heavily prescribed process. Other coachees will\nprefer a less rigid approach. Try to select something that will be effective\nfor the context.\n\n10\\. _Contextualise.  _Most psychometric tools are written in psychobabble and\nneed a bit of work to make them 'come alive'. Keep referring the results of\nthe tool to the objectives and daily challenges of the coachee.\n\n11. _Identify development.  _A good coaching conversation based around a psychometric will lead to valuable insight. Capture strengths and development areas and build these into a personal development plan. \n\n12\\. _Debriefing.  _Usually a summary of the major points of discussion and\nthe planned actions. Sometimes the organisation my be debriefed too; follow\nyour psychometric policy\n\n**Post-Coaching**  \n\n13\\. _Be available._ We often think of our best questions and find our best\ninsights sometime after the session. If there are a limited number of coaching\nsessions it is helpful if the coach can be available for a brief catch-up or\nclarification.\n\n14\\. _Track progress.  _Keep the momentum going. Coachees should regularly\ncheck in on their development plans.\n\n15\\. _Evaluate._  This is perhaps the most important, but most overlooked\nstep. Did the coaching work? What has been its impact?\n\n**Mark Batey is joint chair of The Business of Coaching Conference 2014  to be\nheld in Manchester in November. Delegates will explore practical themes,\nconsider industry case studies and learn from one another, in an event focused\non getting coaching to work**\n\nComments\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nComment\n\n![CAPTCHA](/BotDetectCaptcha.ashx?get=image&c=ServerCaptcha&t=603c8188af3a49c7ab55287a3efcbeed)\n\n[BotDetect CAPTCHA ASP.NET Form Validation](http://captcha.com/asp.net-\ncaptcha-info.html \"BotDetect CAPTCHA ASP.NET Form Validation\")\n\n![Change the CAPTCHA code](/BotDetectCaptcha.ashx?get=ReloadIcon)[![Speak the\nCAPTCHA\ncode](/BotDetectCaptcha.ashx?get=SoundIcon)](/BotDetectCaptcha.ashx?get=sound&c=ServerCaptcha&t=603c8188af3a49c7ab55287a3efcbeed\n\"Speak the CAPTCHA code\")\n\n\n\nCaptcha Code\n\nAll comments are moderated and may take a while to appear.\n\nPost Comment\n\n![HR Logo](/Content/img/logo/hr-logo-footer.png)\n\n  * [About Us](/about-us)\n  * [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://privacypolicy.markallengroup.com)\n  * [Terms & Conditions](https://assets.markallengroup.com/company/generic/legal/terms-conditions.pdf)\n  * [Cookie Policy](https://assets.markallengroup.com/company/generic/legal/cookie-policy.pdf)\n  * [Advertising](/advertising)\n  * [Accessibility](/accessibility)\n\nRegistered in England and Wales.

collect their award for HR Supplier Partnership at the 2019 Personnel\nToday Awards\n\n**KPMG was voted the top HR supplier partner in this category, which is only\nopen to companies working with shortlisted employers. Judges were impressed\nwith its overhaul of the Civil Service Fast Stream programme.**\n\n## WINNER\n\n## KPMG\n\nConsistently ranked as one of the country\u2019s leading graduate employers, the\nCivil Service welcomes around 1,000 new recruits via Fast Stream annually,\ndrawn from over 50,000 applicants. Consulting firm KPMG worked with the Civil\nService to undertake a major overhaul of its learning and development offer\nunderpinning the Fast Stream for its 2018 intake.\n\nThis included removing under-performing topics from the core curriculum, which\nspreads over three to four years. It aimed to provide more contextualised\nlearning, including a more practical and stretching leadership module, giving\nlearners increased control over their learning schedule and allowing them to\nlearn in closed cohorts. Base Camp (induction) activities were also revisited,\nand new sessions were added such as public policy, resilience and wellbeing,\nand presenting and influencing. These were accompanied by keynote speeches\nfrom senior civil servants and a series of evening mini-conferences.\n\nCourses were also made flexible so they could be undertaken when the subject\ncorrelated to work in the learner\u2019s current placement \u2013 and the new-look\ncurriculum was completed by the inclusion of the highly respected Stepping\ninto Leadership management course. Over 90% of delegates feel that Base Camp\nnow inspires them to do the best in their job, that they felt more part of a\ncommunity and were motivated to achieve the Civil Service\u2019s objectives.\n\n\u201cDelivering a project of this sophistication and on such a scale requires an\nincredibly strong collaborative relationship. Innovative, hard-working and\nwith an unwavering focus on our stated objectives, it\u2019s no surprise that KPMG\nhave been able to help us produce a cutting-edge L&D curriculum,\u201d says Nick\nWalker (Deputy Director, CSL). KPMG has also run successful L&D projects for\nthe NHS Leadership Academy.\n\n* * *\n\n## RUNNERS-UP\n\n## Cappfinity\n\nCappfinity, formerly Capp, describe themselves as the Strengths Experts,\nhaving worked with more than 150 organisations worldwide to find and foster\nthe right talent. The company uses behavioural data, strengths expertise and\ninnovative technology to add value to the talent lifecycle. They evaluate\ncandidates\u2019 behavioral, cognitive, and reasoning skills to reveal their true\nfit for the role and the company.\n\n## Personnel Today Awards 2019\n\n**[See the full list of winners](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/personnel-\ntoday-awards-2019-winners/)**\n\nCappfinity\u2019s partnership with Accenture began in 2018 to design and implement\nan immersive, strengths-based recruitment process for Early Careers, based on\ntheir \u2018Brilliance Assessment Model\u2019 for the UK and Ireland. Accenture was\nlooking to transform the recruitment experience for candidates by putting them\nin control of how they explore and complete assessments, and providing them\nwith a developmental learning experience.\n\nThe Accenture Discovery Portal is a unique, immersive recruitment process and\nmultimedia gateway to the world of Accenture. It utilises technology to create\nan authentic experience, delivered through a single screen where they navigate\nthrough a number of interactive content panels, designed to accommodate\nbespoke or customised assessment profiles. Cappfinity analyses results against\nthe Accenture Brilliance Model. Ninety-three percent of candidates felt the\nsubject of their assessments felt relevant and 84% found it innovative\ncompared to a traditional recruitment test. The process has also improved\ndiversity, with 58% female offers (compared to 45% industry average) and 48%\nBAME offers (compared to 30% industry average).\n\nOther clients include Aviva and GSK. Aviva has described Cappfinity as\nbringing \u201creal passion, belief and energy to what they deliver and have had a\nhuge role to play in the success of our programme\u201d.\n\n* * *\n\n## Cezanne HR\n\nCezanne HR offers modern, cloud-first HR software that streamlines and\nimproves HR processes across the full employee life-cycle, whilst\nsimultaneously engaging and empowering the wider workforce to deliver better\nexperience for everyone.\n\nThis is something that the HR team at Open GI recognised from the start of\ntheir project to select and implement a new HR system. Alongside key\nobjectives of greater efficiency, improved processes and a platform that would\ncater for organisational change, the HR team wanted the system to deliver\nvalue to the whole of the organisation. Cezanne HR delivered a company-wide HR\nsolution that has achieved their project objectives, including: immediate\nefficiency gains; ongoing cost savings (of around \u00a34,000); improved company-\nwide communication; robust data security (GDPR compliant) and support for\nbusiness change. The system is now used by over 550 employees across the\nbusiness (Worcester, Dublin, London, Milton Keynes, Skopje and Krakow).\n\nCezanne supported Open GI with training pre-launch, including a sandbox system\nso employees could explore it in the context of the company\u2019s processes and\ndata. There were also webinars, drop-in clinics and support with knowledge and\ndata transfer.\n\n\u201cAlongside saving us tons of time, Cezanne HR has everything we need from an\nHR platform. There\u2019s so much more that we want to do with it, and we know that\nthe team will take our requirements into consideration and will help us to get\nthe most out of our platform,\u201d says Natalie Brotherton, HR manager.\n\nOther clients include ASL Aviation Group (global roll-out) and ByrneLooby\n(phased implementation across global offices).\n\n* * *\n\n## Egremont Group\n\nEgremont Group is a management consultancy that helps companies achieve\nbreakthrough change. It assists its clients to identify what\u2019s holding them\nback and create a movement for change that re-energises the organisation and\nits people. It recently worked with Southern Water on an organisation wide\ntransformation programme to enable culture change, drive operational\nexcellence and implement a more effective and cost-efficient support services\nmodel.\n\nRegulators had defined ambitious targets across the industry driving a need to\nembark on large-scale change. Egremont was asked to design, mobilise and\nimplement a cultural transformation programme that would strengthen the\nbusiness\u2019 position as they head into the next regulatory period. Egremont\napproached this through three lenses: aligning leadership around key\npriorities; establishing stable and repeatable processes; and creating an\neffective organisational configuration that would allow the first two to\nhappen.\n\nEnablers of change at this scale included agreeing key leadership principles\nupfront, reducing silos and clarifying roles and responsibilities. Area and\nregional managers have been participants of an applied leadership development\nprogramme and there are around 70 hubs across the business which improve\nconnection and collaboration between teams. This new approach has resulted in\nreduced risk, increased efficiency, more productive use of resources and\nincreased engagement scores.\n\nRob Barnett, Southern Water\u2019s managing director said of the work: \u201cThe\norganisation is set up to be much more successful. Some of the historical\nissues have been dealt with, we\u2019ve had good financial return with many\nmillions of savings and efficiencies, but for me more importantly we\u2019ve built\nenduring capability that will allow us to drive multiple benefits in the\nfuture.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n## Lane 4\n\nLane4\u2019s purpose is to build winning organisations and improve working people\u2019s\nlives. That means developing successful, long-term partnerships, and the\ncompany is still working with its very first client, Bourne Leisure, 25 years\non.\n\nLane4 worked with construction company Wates to help it achieve the culture\nchange necessary to reach its \u2018zero-harm by 2020\u2019 goal. Working together,\nthree teams from Wates (Safety, HR, and Internal Communications) along with a\ndedicated Lane4 team created a programme combining technical safety training\nwith leadership skills, underpinned by a compelling communications campaign.\n\nMore than 1,000 employees have been on one of two programmes \u2013 Lead the\nChange! and Drive the Change! \u2013 and the goal of a lost time injury rate below\n0.100 has been achieved two years early. Debbie Crew, Head of Talent &\nResourcing says that \u201cLane4 offered us the best of both worlds: a leadership\nprogramme with a clear focus on safety. Their proposal showed that they\u2019d\nlistened carefully to what we told them and that they had quickly grasped our\nobjectives.\u201d\n\nAnother successful project has been with engineering company IMI, where Lane4\ndeveloped a global, bespoke management development programme. This has helped\nto upskill more than 1,000 new and existing managers and develop a secure\ntalent pipeline. Collaboration has been integral to the programme\u2019s success,\nmixing IMI expertise in \u201clean operations\u201d and financial management with\nLane4\u2019s expertise in skills such as performance management and coaching to\ncreate an impactful programme. There are six-monthly reviews and IMI and Lane4\nare now working together on phase two of the programme.\n\nOther client partnership successes include leadership development programmes\nfor the Mott McDonald and Anglian Water.\n\n* * *\n\n## Pearson TQ\n\nPearson TQ designs, develops and delivers bespoke training solutions,\nincluding the assessment and provision of accredited qualifications for public\nand private sector clients.\n\nIn 2017, it partnered with BT to develop a Future Leaders programme for\naspiring managers. It wanted to enhance its existing management training,\nexpand accreditations, and embrace the Apprenticeship Levy for all eligible\nparticipants. Over three years the programme has developed over 600 learners\nacross fourteen countries. Pearson TQ worked with BT to understand its\nleadership framework, its performance management and reward so these could all\nbe aligned with its vision, values and culture. It also supported the company\nto get senior-level buy-in and to support learners throughout the programme.\n\n## Personnel Today Awards 2019\n\n[**See the full list of\nwinners**](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/personnel-today-\nawards-2019-winners/)\n\nThe training itself includes: 1-to-1 personalised coaching, regular progress\nreviews, group, classroom and workplace learning, online resources and\nemployer-focused work-based projects. Participants can achieve a BTEC L3\nDiploma in Management and a Team Leader Apprenticeship Standard if they are\neligible. Almost all (96%) of line managers agree that their team member \u201cis\ndeveloping into a leader/manager\u201d and 31% of participants have been promoted\nsince the programme. By retaining and promoting key talent into management\nroles, BT has reduced external hire costs whilst creating a long-term talent\npipeline.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve addressed issues \u2026 positively and collaboratively and \u2026 made\nimprovements in content, process and communications in real-time,\u201d says Debbie\nCopping, Leadership Development Manager at BT. Other client successes include\ndelivering apprenticeships to various organisations within the Ministry of\nDefence.\n\n* * *\n\n## Saville Assessment\n\nSaville Assessment is an assessment and psychometrics company, now part of\nWillis Towers Watson. It worked with Johnson & Johnson (J&J) to implement a\ntechnology solution that would make their hiring process more robust and\nefficient whilst improving candidate experience. J&J collaborated with Saville\nto become early adopters of a new proprietary piece of technology, the Role\nFit app.\n\nThe app allows recruiters to select \u2013 on screen \u2013 the competencies that are\ncritical to that role, and powers online assessments to assess suitability and\nrecommend individually tailored interview questions. It meant J&J could\nidentify better quality candidates for roles, using as little resource as\npossible. The app generates interview guides so recruiters can ask targeted\nquestions and efficiently use their time. The highly predictive nature of the\nassessments ensures that J&J hires the best talent but also means a greater\nreturn on investment as they hire individuals who are both productive and fit\nwith the J&J culture.\n\nIn some recent analysis of almost 7,000 applicants, 99.4% of candidates who\nstarted the Graduate and Placement Situational Judgement Test (SJT) went on to\ncomplete the assessment. These low drop-out rates indicate that candidates are\nhighly engaged. In the experienced-hire process, applicants are given\npersonalised feedback reports at the online assessment stage.\n\nSaville has worked with around 900 clients and has been praised by the British\nPsychological Society for a \u201cvery high-quality programme\u201d. One of the team at\nJ&J said of the company\u2019s support: \u201cWe were particularly impressed with\nSaville Assessment\u2019s focus on five factors against which assessment solutions\nshould be evaluated.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n## The Development Company UK Ltd (DCo)\n\nDCo provides bespoke learning and development initiatives for clients across\nall sectors. Its ethos is to build strong partnerships and design tailored\nsolutions that enable clients to meet their business challenges through high-\nperforming employees. It has a long relationship with missile systems company\nMBDA and recently supported it to review its graduate and apprenticeship\noffering.\n\nThe solution had to dovetail with MBDA\u2019s existing early career framework and\nalso achieve an increase in the graduate and apprentices\u2019 ability to\nassimilate information, respond to coaching, forge strong relationships with\nclients and undertake the role of ambassadors for the company. It put in place\ntwo experiential development programmes: \u2018Lifeskills\u2019 for Apprentices is a\ntwo-part residential programme and \u2018GR8\u2019 is an intensive week-long programme\nthat covers eight core topics identified as essential for the creation of\nproficient communicators, leaders and managers. Around 450 apprentices have\nexperienced the Lifeskills programme and MBDA boasts an 82% retention rate of\napprentices since 2003.\n\nSince 2016, 275 graduates have completed GR8. The programme includes realistic\nscenarios and challenging experiential coaching \u2013 such as learning\npresentation skills in a theatre and risk assessment/team collaboration by way\nof a coasteering challenge. Around 230 internal mentors have been trained to\nsupport individuals whilst they are within the scheme. The company now has a\n58% promotion rate within two years of individuals completing schemes. Other\nclient successes include a leadership programme for Johnson Matthey, which has\nled to 40% of participants in its first cohort now occupying more senior\nroles.\n\n[![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/09/2019-sponsors-2.jpg)](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/09/2019-sponsors-2.jpg)\n\n[Previous

have, in the past, pursued an exclusively graduate\nrecruitment policy are now starting to look at school leavers. Others are\nadopting a more proactive approach to attracting candidates from more diverse\ncommunities.\n\nDavid Barrett, chief operating officer of\n[cut-e](http://www.cut-e.com/assessment-solutions/), which specialises in\ntalent measurement and psychometric assessments, explains: \u201cCompanies are\nreally taking diversity and inclusion seriously now.\n\nUsing criteria that are purely based on education and social background tends\nto lead to less diversity, but psychometric testing puts things on a more\nlevel playing pitch\u201d \u2013 David Barrett, cut-e\n\n\u201cTen years ago, a lot of things were done for legal reasons, but people are\nnow very aware that being able to harvest from a much wider demographic is\nmaximising the search for better talent and enables a much more sure and high-\nvolume supply.\u201d\n\nThe shift has also partly been driven by globalisation as the spending power\nof different groups around the world has risen, he says. But the media has\nplayed its part too in increasingly holding to account companies that have, to\ndate, only paid lip service to inclusion.\n\n## Psychometric testing\n\n**[Best practice in psychometric testing](http://www.xperthr.co.uk/policies-\nand-documents/policy-on-best-practice-in-psychometric-\ntesting/45186/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n**[Guide for global employers: Recruitment and\nselection](http://www.xperthr.co.uk/international-manual/guide-for-global-\nemployers-recruitment-and-\nselection/153022/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n\u201cThe change isn\u2019t necessarily out of the goodness of their hearts, but for the\ngoodness of their wallets,\u201d Barrett says. \u201cThe issue is that you're wasting\n95% of available talent by only going after candidates from Ivy League-\nequivalent universities, when you could be reaching brilliant talent across\nthe world.\u201d\n\nAs a result, firms such as Deloitte are starting to look for alternative\napproaches. Last autumn, the management consultancy adopted a \u201cblind CV\u201d\nprocess when hiring for 1,500 graduate and school leaver positions.\n\nThis meant that the schools or universities attended by applicants was hidden\nfrom recruiters until a job offer was made, in a bid to reduce bias.\n\n## Psychometric assessment\n\nAnother possible route is to use psychometric testing in the shape of online\nassessments and questionnaires. \u201cUsing criteria that are purely based on\neducation and social background tends to lead to less diversity, but\npsychometric testing puts things on a more level playing pitch,\u201d says Barrett.\n\n\u201cYou can make better use of talent communities in a particular market or\nregion and access people in places that you wouldn\u2019t have been able to reach\nbefore.\u201d\n\nTo broaden this reach further, cut-e has partnered with [Arctic\nShores](https://www.arcticshores.com), which introduced its psychometric games\nsoftware for recruitment to the market late last year.\n\nThe machine learning-based system measures each applicant\u2019s skills, abilities\nand potential to perform in a given role based on characteristics such as\ntheir appetite for risk, tolerance of ambiguity and persistence.\n\nThis information then enables recruiters to match individual profiles against\ntheir own requirements. Not only does the gamification element of the test\nmake it fun for candidates to undertake, but it also provides them with\nfeedback about themselves at the end.\n\nThe aim of the new partnership is to integrate Arctic Shores\u2019 software with\ncut-e\u2019s own assessment techniques and systems, in order to create customised\ntalent acquisition offerings for clients.\n\nThe two vendors are already undertaking a joint project with Vodafone, for\nwhich cut-e is running a graduate assessment centre.\n\nAccording to Robert Newry, founder and managing of Arctic Shores, this initial\ncollaboration involves coming up with a \u201cmini version of our psychometric game\nto act as a teaser or prelude to the online assessment provided by cut-e\u201d.\n\nFuture collaboration is also expected to include new content and potentially\nnew jointly developed products.\n\nBut, as Barrett concludes: \u201cLower socio-economic groups are more comfortable\nusing games when applying for jobs than they would be with more traditional\nmethods. Employers are also happy to have an engaging assessment that won\u2019t\npotentially put candidates off. It\u2019s about giving everyone a chance and not\njust those with the right CV who went to the right school.\u201d\n\n[Previous

espa\u00f1ol](/2014/08/the-problem-with-using-personality-tests-for-\nhiring?language=es)\n\nA decade ago, researchers discovered something that should have opened eyes\nand raised red flags in the business world.\n\nSara Rynes, Amy Colbert, and Kenneth Brown [conducted a\nstudy](http://www.cebma.org/wp-content/uploads/Rynes-et-al-HR-Professionals-\nbelief-about-effective-human-resource-practices-HRM-2002.pdf) in 2002 to\ndetermine whether the beliefs of HR professionals were consistent with\nestablished research findings on the effectiveness of various HR practices.\nThey surveyed 1,000 Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) members \u2014 HR\nManagers, Directors, and VPs \u2014 with an average of 14 years\u2019 experience.\n\nThe results? The area of greatest disconnect was in staffing\u2014 one of the\nlynchpins of HR. This was particularly prevalent in the area of hiring\nassessments, where more than 50% of respondents were unfamiliar with\nprevailing research findings.\n\n[![What HR Managers Get Wrong\nchart](/resources/images/article_assets/2014/08/whathrmanagersget1.gif)](/resources/images/article_assets/2014/08/whathrmanagersget1.gif)\n\nSeveral studies since have explored why these research findings have seemingly\nfailed to transfer to HR practitioners. Among the causes are the fact that HR\nprofessionals often don\u2019t have time to read the latest research; the research\nitself is often present with technically complex language and data; and that\nthe prospect of introducing an entirely new screening measure is daunting from\nmultiple angles.\n\nAt the same time, anyone who has ever been responsible for hiring, much less\nmanaging, employees knows that there is a wide variation in worker performance\nlevels across jobs. Therefore, it is critical for organizations to understand\nwhat differences among individuals _systematically_ affect job performance so\nthat the candidates with the greatest probability of success can be hired.\n\n**So what are the most effective screening measures?**\n\nExtensive research has been done on the ability of various hiring methods and\nmeasures to actually predict job performance. A seminal work in this area is\nFrank Schmidt\u2019s meta-analysis of a century\u2019s worth of workplace productivity\ndata, first published in 1998 and recently updated. The table below shows the\npredictive validity of some commonly used selection practices, sorted from\nmost effective to least effective, according to his latest analysis that was\nshared at the Personnel Testing Counsel Metropolitan Washington chapter\nmeeting this past November:\n\n[![Most effective screening measures\nchart](/resources/images/article_assets/2014/08/themosteffective.gif)](/resources/images/article_assets/2014/08/themosteffective.gif)\n\nSo if your hiring process relies primarily on interviews, reference checks,\nand personality tests, you are choosing to use a process that is\n_significantly less effective_ than it could be if more effective measures\nwere incorporated.\n\nAnd yet that\u2019s how many companies operate. [According to a 2011 NBC News\narticle](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/44120975/ns/business-careers/t/employers-\nturn-tests-weed-out-job-seekers/#.U_TsT7xdV_9), the use of personality\nassessments are on the rise, growing as much as 20% annually. Especially\nproblematic is the widespread use of Four Quadrant (4-Q) personality tests for\nhiring, something I see regularly in my consulting work.\n\nA 4-Q assessment is one where the results classify you as some combination of\nfour different options labeled as letters, numbers, colors, animals, etc. They\noriginated around 450 BC when Empedocles noticed that he could group people\u2019s\nbehavior into four categories which he labeled earth, water, fire, and air.\nHippocrates made the same observation, but (coming from a medical background)\nlabeled the categories blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. Since then,\nhundreds of iterations of these tools have been developed, all essentially\nbased on the same premise and theory.\n\nGenerally speaking, 4-Q tools consist of a list of adjectives from which\nrespondents select words that are most/least like them, and are designed to\nmeasure \u201cstyle,\u201d or tendencies and preferences. While they can seem highly\ninsightful \u2014 not to mention being widely available and inexpensive \u2014 they have\nsome severe shortcomings when used in high stakes applications such as hiring.\n\nFor one, they tend to be highly transparent, enabling a test taker to\nmanipulate the results in a way that they feel will be viewed favorably by the\nadministrator. Also, since they are designed to measure \u201cstates\u201d (as opposed\nto more stable \u201ctraits\u201d), there is a significant chance that the results will\nchange over time as the individual\u2019s context changes (most publishers of 4-Q\ntests recommend that individuals re-take them at fairly frequent intervals for\nthis reason).\n\nThis begs the question: How can an individual\u2019s assessment results be used to\npredict future job performance if there is a reasonable chance that their\nscores will change over time?\n\nWhen using any assessment, managers need to step back and ask themselves one\nbasic question before giving it to a potential employee: Is this test\npredictive of future job performance? In the case of 4-Qs, probably not. They\ncan provide tremendous value for self-discovery, team building, coaching,\nenhancing communication, and numerous other developmental applications. But\ndue to limited predictive validity, low test-retest reliability, lack of\nnorming and an internal consistency (lie detector) measure, etc., they are not\nideal for use in hiring.\n\nThe strongest personality assessments to use in a hiring context are ones that\npossess these attributes:\n\n  * Measure _stable_ traits that will not tend to change once the candidate has been on the job for some length of time.\n  * Are _normative_ in nature, which allows you to compare one candidate\u2019s scores against another\u2019s to determine which individual possess more (or less) of a particular trait.\n  * Have a \u201ccandidness\u201d (or \u201cdistortion\u201d or \u201clie detector\u201d) scale so you understand how likely it is that the results accurately portray the test-taker.\n  * Have high reliability (including test-retest reliability) and have been shown to be valid predictors of job performance.\n\nEven when using a tool that meets the criteria outlined above, personality\nconstructs are not the most predictive measure available. Personality tests\nare most effective when combined with other measures with higher predictive\nvalidity, such as integrity or cognitive ability.\n\nUsing well-validated, highly predictive assessment tools can give business\nowners and managers a significant leg up when trying to select candidates who\nwill become top producers for the organization. However, all assessment\napproaches are not created equal. And some will not offer a significant return\non your investment. Accordingly to a [2014 Aberdeen\nstudy](http://www.aberdeen.com/login/?doc=/launch/report/research_report/9043-RR-\nmeasuring-assessment-success.asp) [registration required], only 14% of\norganizations have data to prove the positive business impact of their\nassessment strategy. Knowing which types of assessments will be most effective\nin accomplishing the specific objectives you have identified for your\norganization will enable you to select a tool with a measurable impact on the\nbottom line.\n\n* * *\n\nAs a measurement strategist at ProActive Consulting, Whitney's passion and\nexpertise lies in the field of surveys and assessments. A self-professed \"data\nnerd,\" Whitney has a Master's Degree in the area of Human Resources\nMeasurement and Evaluation and has conducted extensive research on the\npredictive validity of various hiring assessment strategies.\n\n* * *\n\n###### This article is about [HIRING](/topic/hiring)\n\n__Follow this topic\n\n__Following\n\nRelated Topics:\n\n  * [Human resource management](/topic/human-resource-management)\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\n#### Partner Center\n\n[Coronavirus](/insight-center/coronavirus) [Magazine](/magazine)\n[Popular](/most-popular) [Topics](/topics) [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n[Video](/video) [Store](/store) [The Big Idea](/big-ideas) [Visual\nLibrary](/visual-library) [Reading Lists](/reading-lists) [Case\nSelections](/case-selections)\n\n[![Harvard Business Review Home](/resources/css/images/hbr_logo.svg)](/)\n\n[**Subscribe**](/subscribe)\n\n###### Explore HBR\n\n  * [The Latest](/the-latest)\n  * [Most Popular](/most-popular)\n  * [All Topics](/topics)\n  * [Magazine Archive](/magazine)\n  * [The Big Idea](/big-ideas)\n  * [Reading Lists](/reading-lists)\n  * [Case Selections](/case-selections)\n  * [Video](/video)\n  * [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n  * [Webinars](/webinars)\n  * [Visual Library](/visual-library)\n  * [My Library](/my-library)\n  * [Newsletters](/email-newsletters)\n  * [HBR Ascend](https://hbrascend.org/)\n\n###### HBR Store\n\n  * [Article Reprints](/store/articles)\n  * [Books](/store/books)\n  * [Cases](/store/case-studies)\n  * [Collections](/store/collections)\n  * [Magazine Issues](/store/magazine-issues)\n  * [HBR Guide Series](/store/landing/guides)\n  * [HBR 20-Minute Managers](/store/landing/20-minute-managers)\n  * [HBR Emotional Intelligence Series](/store/landing/emotional-intelligence-series)\n  * [HBR Must Reads](/store/landing/mustreads)\n  * [Tools](/store/tools)\n\n###### About HBR\n\n  * [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n  * [Advertise with Us](/hbr-advertising-sales)\n  * [Information for Booksellers/Retailers](/booksellers-retailers)\n  * [Masthead](/about-hbr)\n  * [Global Editions](/global-editions)\n  * [Media Inquiries](/media-inquiries)\n  * [Guidelines for Authors](/guidelines-for-authors-web)\n  * [HBR Analytic Services](/hbr-analytic-services)\n\n###### HBR Subscriber Assistance\n\n  * [Subscribe](/subscribe)\n  * [Subscriber Help](/subscriber-help)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.274.3214](tel:+18002743214)  \n[harvard@cdsfulfillment.com](mailto:harvard@cdsfulfillment.com)  \n[hbr.org/subscriberservices](/subscriberservices)\n\n  * International:  \n[+44.1858.438.412](tel:+441858438412)  \n[(Asia Pacific: +61.2.9158.6127)](tel:+61291586127)  \n[hbr@subscription.co.uk](mailto:hbr@subscription.co.uk)  \n[subscription.co.uk/hbr/help](https://www.subscription.co.uk/hbr/help)\n\n###### HBR.ORG Customer Assistance\n\n  * [Help Center](/help-customer-service-home)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.988.0886](tel:+18009880886)\n\n  *   * International:  \n[617.783.7500](tel:+16177837500)\n\n  * Email:  \n[customerservice@harvardbusiness.org](mailto:customerservice@harvardbusiness.org)\n\n  * [Copyright Permissions](/permissions)\n\n###### Follow HBR\n\n  * __[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/HBR)\n  * __[Twitter](http://twitter.com/HarvardBiz)\n  * __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review?trk=biz-companies-cym)\n  * __[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harvard_business_review/?hl=en)\n  * __[Your Newsreader](http://feeds.hbr.org/harvardbusiness/)\n\n![Harvard Business Publishing](/resources/images/2018/new_logo_May11.png)\n\n  * [About Us](/corporate/about)\n  * [Careers](/corporate/careers)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n  * [Copyright Information](/corporate/copyright)\n  * [Trademark Policy](http://trademark.harvard.edu/pages/trademark-notice)\n\n  \n\nHarvard Business Publishing:\n\n  * [Higher Education](http://hbsp.harvard.edu/)\n  * [Corporate Learning](http://www.harvardbusiness.org)\n  * [Harvard Business Review](http://hbr.org/)\n  * [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Harvard Business School Publishing.

I hope I got close on that one.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 0:58  \n  \nAbsolutely. Perfect.\n\nJim Collison 0:59  \n  \nShe works as a senior consultant here at Gallup and first time on Called to\nCoach, which is why I struggled a little bit. But Tanvi, welcome to Called to\nCoach. Great to have you here.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 1:09  \n  \nThank you. Thank you very much, Jim. Thank you.\n\nJim Collison 1:12  \n  \nGreat to have you. Let's take a second introduce, why don't you take a second,\nTanvi, since you're new to Called to Coach, just introduce yourself a little\nbit. And then let's introduce our guest.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 1:20  \n  \nYes. Wonderful, great. Well, I'm a senior consultant with Gallup. And very\ninterestingly, the guest over here, Vivian and I, we we joined our respective\ncompanies in the same month and the same year, in May 2012. Well, I work\nextensively with Fortune 500 companies in India and also with some in the\nMiddle East. And, you know, and I do a lot of work around executing our Gallup\nscience and I also and extensively around strength and leadership and\nmanagerial development. And I've also now started managing business for our\nNorth Region in India. And I'm very excited to be a part of our fabulous\nCalled to Coach series, and I'm happy to welcome our guest, Vivian Alfred.\nWell, Vivian, a very warm, very warm welcome to Called to Coach today.\n\nVivian Alfred 2:06  \n  \nThank you, Tanvi. Thank you, Jim.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 2:09  \n  \nWonderful. I'm going to take a minute to introduce you but you -- yeah.\n\nVivian Alfred 2:16  \n  \nNo, you could go ahead to introduce.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 2:18  \n  \nWonderful. I'm going to introduce Vivian for all of us here joining us live\nand also for this recording. Vivian is the Vice President, Human Resources at\nEndress + Hauser. And he's had about 17 years of experience in human resources\nand 5 years as a journalist. Vivian also has extensive expertise in the area\nand focuses on leadership development, employee engagement, career planning,\npsychometrics and neurolinguistic programming, which is very, very\ninteresting. He also has successfully developed Discover Your Power Framework\nto empower individuals, teams and organizations to help meet their full\npotential. So during the course of our conversation today, we'd also love to\nhear a bit about that, too. So, Vivian, let's let's get started. Let's Let's\nhear about how your journey has been since the time you certified as a\n[Gallup-Certified Strengths Coach](https://courses.gallup.com/strengths-\ncoaching-certification).\n\nVivian Alfred 3:15  \n  \nWell, I got certified just in 2018. And you know, since then, it has been it\nhas been quite an interesting it has been quite an interesting journey. Well,\nstrengths as such as -- the\n[StrengthsFinder](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths) as such is not is\nnot something that is that is new to me now. It's something that I've known\nsince 2006. Now, that's when I actually got exposed to strengths. So can I\ntalk a little bit about my history if I may?\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 3:43  \n  \nYou must. Yes, please, we'd love to hear.\n\nVivian Alfred 3:46  \n  \nSo it this was a U.S. company where I had joined in 2006. And, and, you know,\nthe day I started, the first day that I started and and my CEO there\nmentioned, you know, in the welcome that you know, we're going to have\nsomething for you and just wanted to understand if you you have ever\nunderstood [the Gallup\nStrengthsFinder](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths) [CliftonStrengths].\nSo I said, Well, I have read I mean I must have read the book but nothing that\nI've gone deeper into it but it's it's something of interest to me. So that's\nwhen I got the Gallup 2.0 book there in the office for all of us. We had the\nlinks and and we we did the StrengthsFinder so that was the first time that we\nhad actually got into it, but after that we did not go much deeper. Though I\nread the book, I found it very interesting. I had I had had you know\nunderstood something about about myself. Well, if you asked me to recollect my\nTop 5 in from 2006, I don't recollect. Because that's that's not handy.\n\nVivian Alfred 4:48  \n  \nBut I recollect that, you know, more or less whatever was captured then is\nsomething what I still have it on my Top 5 even today. So so that's when it\nall started. We did it for our management team; we did it for some of our\nsenior people, only the StrengthsFinder, we just took the reports and that's\nabout it. So each of them read their reports and said, OK, this is something\ngood, this is something lively, but we did not go beyond that. But from there\non, when I joined here in Endress + Hauser in 2012, you know, I said, at some\npoint in time, I need to really go deeper into this. And, and and see how this\ncan really, you know, sort of help people, you know, guide them maybe in their\nleadership development or maybe in in career development, etc.\n\nVivian Alfred 5:32  \n  \nSo here in Endress + Hauser, I'm heading Human Resources, I am having a charge\ninto this profile. So responsible for all all activities from L&D to strategic\nhuman resources, employee engagement. OK. And, OK, also a bit of IR is also\nincluded into the profile but it's I would say more than 95 percentage of my\nprofile is completely in Human Resources. The legal part of the profile -- I\nalso have a legal person reporting in to me; that's the 5% of IR which is\nthere in addition but otherwise it's it's primarily the 95% of that is firmly\ninto into HR.\n\nVivian Alfred 6:13  \n  \nSo Endress + Hauser is a process automation company. And it's, it's a Swiss\nGerman company. It's a headquartered in Switzerland in Reinach. Here in India,\nwe are headquartered here in Mumbai. We have around 10 regional offices across\nacross India. Around 250 people, around -- that is what we have here in India.\nOn the sales center side -- so we have two factions, one is the sales center\nand one is a production center. So the sales center is here and headquartered\nin Mumbai, for which I'm heading here. And then we also have a production\ncenter in Ahmedabad, which has 3 manufacturing facilities, and that has\nanother 250 odd people.\n\nVivian Alfred 6:53  \n  \nSo overall, we have 500 people in India and, well, after getting myself\ncertified in 2018, after getting myself certified, I wanted to sort of use\nthis tool in a way that how I can help my people in sales, marketing, maybe\nacross all all all all functions of how we could in a sort of develop them\ninto in their roles. So, career management was one of the focus; leadership\ndevelopment was another focus that we were talking about, we were also seeing\nhow effectively we can help them, you know, flourish in their current roles.\nSo all those things, you know, was was something which became a part of my\njourney since the StrengthsFinder started.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 7:39  \n  \nThat's great. That's wonderful to hear. I'd love to hear a little bit more\nabout going a step -- maybe going a little deeper into this to say, you know,\nif you could share some examples of how you integrated strengths into into\nEndress + Hauser. I know you spoke about, you know, helping them flourish in\ntheir career. So some examples will be great.\n\nVivian Alfred 8:00  \n  \nYeah, so, you know, it was 2017 and in 2017 there was a changeover in in our\nin our top management. So, so, of course, I had I had gone for the course in\n2017 the [Accelerated Strengths\nCoaching](https://courses.gallup.com/courses/strengths/accelerated-coaching-\nprogram.html) course here in in Mumbai. And so, after coming back from the\ncourse, of course, we had a new Managing Director, but the new managing\ndirector was you know, actually from -- I mean it was a succession planning\nfrom internal -- internal succession planning. So, he was primarily earlier\nthe head of sales for for India and we, we got him to, you know, head the\norganization.\n\nVivian Alfred 8:42  \n  \nOK, why I'm bringing this point is, you know, after after my course, I, I went\nahead and [did the\nStrengthsFinder](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253868/popular-\ncliftonstrengths-assessment-products.aspx) with with this candidate, you know,\nthe internal candidate also. So who, who eventually became the manager who\neventually is now the Managing Director for Endress + Hauser India. So, you\nknow, so so when I did that, and you know, he's -- he saw his report and then,\nyou know, I sort of chatted with him on that. And he really felt this was\nsomething remarkably useful. And he actually saw his mirror image. And he\nsaid, You know, this is what I am and I mean, I can't believe it. This is this\nis exactly what it talks about. And this is how I -- this is how I interact\nwith people. This is how I, I build relationships. This is how I connect.\n\nVivian Alfred 9:29  \n  \nAnd, well, from there it was it was much easier because the MD [Managing\nDirector] himself had bought in at that stage while he was the succession\nplanning ladder. So after after he become -- after he became the new Managing\nDirector, it became all the more easier for me to start, you know,\nimplementing the StrengthsFinder here in India. We started with the MD; then\nwe moved on to the management team. And now it's become a kind of a practice\nin Endress + Hauser in India.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 10:00  \n  \nThat's great. So does this work across levels, Vivian, the StrengthsFinder in\nterms of conversations on how they leverage -- people leverage strengths in\nthis organization?\n\nVivian Alfred 10:10  \n  \nYes. Yes. So, so, so at least, you know, what we did this as a Step 1, I think\nat the Level 1, what we did is we did it for the management team. And at the\nother management team level, we actually helped them, you know, we identify\ntheir Top 5; we also eventually did their [All\n34](https://store.gallup.com/p/en-us/10003/cliftonstrengths-34). So, that,\nyeah, so that we had we had all those in place. And sort of we also, you know,\nso that was my Step 1, and then from there, we moved on to, you know,\nidentify, you know, the high potentials across various departments or\nprocesses, to whom we also escalated.\n\nVivian Alfred 10:48  \n  \nWe, we had a, we had one team, which I mean is a Mumbai regional team, the\nMumbai sales team, the regional team, where we actually started you know, sort\nof implementing this StrengthsFinder. We had, we had the entire team go\nthrough this. So I would say that was my pilot project where, actually that\nthe StrengthsFinder gained more visibility across all levels. Because what\nhappened was the region was actually in doldrums and it was actually going\nthrough a lot of turmoil. There were a lot of organizational changes that\nhappened prior to 2017 and the organization -- the Mumbai sales organization,\nthe sales team, was actually coming up to speed and they had these new\nincumbents in. So I had a discussion with the with the regional head of Mumbai\nand, you know, we said, you know, why don't we look at something different of\nhow we could have people more connected to their jobs? How we could, you know,\nleverage on what they can do best. And he was he was kind of kicked up.\n\nVivian Alfred 11:49  \n  \nSo I did a StrengthsFinder with him. And from there on, the journey started.\nHe found it immensely valuable; he then started connecting it with his team\nmembers, you know, and and and then the region went on to win the Best Region\nAward in 2018. So 2018 they won the Best Region Award, and the entire team had\ngone for a junket trip outside with the family. So they were like gung ho, and\nand that became a kind of a trend -- from there, it became kind of a trend for\npeople to you know, get more inroads. On the other side, the management team\nwas also experiencing a lot of positive things out of the StrengthsFinder, and\nand then, you know, they started building upon this. What I would add up here\nis something what I developed here internally was the inner discovery of\npower. So, so when I said this discovery of power, what we did is had -- OK.\nPOWER stands for -- P stands for Potential; O for Optimal best. And W for what\ndo you Want; your Environment is E; and Red spots is, you know, R. So that is\nwhat power is all about.\n\nVivian Alfred 13:04  \n  \nSo, what I had done at the start was to make it more simplified, you know, for\npeople reading the report and, you know, helping them register into their\nmindset, into their practice, I adopted this model of POWER and integrated\nwith something called How can you make your customers HAPPY? So, when I say\n\"happy,\" when I say HAPPY, HAPPY stands for -- H stands for _Help_ ; how do\nyou _Avoid_ certain things with the customers? How do you _Provide_ stability,\nyou know, to the customer -- so, how do you _Provide_ a secure base to the\ncustomer? How do you _Provide_ inspiration to the customer? And how do you\n_Yield_ trust? So, how do you produce trust?\n\nVivian Alfred 13:43  \n  \nSo, all -- these elements, so, how you discover your POWER and how can you\nmake your customers HAPPY? So, these two elements were kind of integrated\nwithin [the StrengthsFinder\npiece](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253868/popular-\ncliftonstrengths-assessment-products.aspx). So, we had the strengths\nidentified for people, and we just help them identify as a -- say for example,\n[if you have\nStrategic](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252350/strategic-\ntheme.aspx), how will you use Strategic to _Help_ the customers? How you can\nuse a strategy to _Avoid_ certain discussions or certain you know,\nconfrontations with customers? How you can use that to you know, _Provide_ a\nsecure base to them? How you can use that, you know, to _Provide_ more to\ninspire your customers more? How do you use that to you know, build that trust\nbetween you and the customer?\n\nVivian Alfred 14:25  \n  \nSo, this this this tool kind of gained a good popularity. So people you know,\nsort of got connected easily to this thing and again, again, when I say\n\"POWER,\" in POWER, we said you know, say if you want Strategic, what's the\nPotential that your strength Strategic has? How do you use this talent theme\nin a way that can you know, produce best results for people? At your Optimal\nbest, what can you really go ahead and achieve using using Strategic? Then,\nyou know, what is that you Want from the, you know, from the environment? What\nis that you generally need in order to make your strength more effective? So,\nwhich is anyway a part of your, the the Team Cards that we have. Then we -- I\nalso added the element Environment -- what Environment can help you to\nflourish more, better? So how do you how do you create that Environment for\nyourself, using that strength of Strategic? And what are those Red spots, so,\nmeans, what you have to refrain from in order to have your results\naccomplished.\n\nVivian Alfred 15:28  \n  \nSo, so, when we land on this thing, we created the -- we call this kit, we\ncall this as a talent toolkit. So, it was a talent toolkit. So, people could\nhave this as a easy reference material for them to actually go through them\nand and, you know, start connecting it to their roles and start connecting it\nto their, to their jobs.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 15:51  \n  \nThat's great. Thank you for sharing, yeah. Go ahead, Vivian.\n\nVivian Alfred 15:57  \n  \nSo, so, similarly, even for the management team, we had, we had developed this\nthing. And we, you know, they started integrating it with with their team. So\nfrom there we also started using this now also for -- recently, I was in\nSwitzerland -- in Zurich, in Reinach, that's our headquarters. We had our HR\nconference where I was you know, hosting the regional HR meeting. So, all our\nregional HR heads in the Asia Pacific Region also had the benefit of you know,\nhaving this workshop, where I conducted this workshop for them and where I,\nyou know, showed the elements of POWER, how you can use the POWER of your\nstrengths in your roles in human resources.\n\nVivian Alfred 16:43  \n  \nOK, so on one part, what your job -- what your job role is, and how you can\nuse your Top 5 -- rather, I would say your Top 12 -- so I went a little more\ndeeper so, which means your dominant talent themes and ahead. Then how do you\nalso use your supporting themes? And what should you sort of, I'm -- the\nBottom 10, something which you should not really focus too deep. Rather, you'd\nstart, you know, looking at those which are there at the top -- how you can\nuse them to actually, you know, progress in your role, or to actually succeed\nin your role. So this is what we had the workshop, and it was pretty good,\nvery quite successful. So I'm also developing a talent toolkit for the HR\nfolks in the region on this. So it's it's been quite an interesting journey.\nI'm really loving it. It's, it's a lovely experience.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 17:35  \n  \nThat's great. And and I really liked what you said in the beginning that the\nexisting MD is where you know, the bind that you got in early on that really\ngave you sort of inroads to expand the foray and reach out to more people\nwithin the organization. So tell me, Vivian, you know, the sounds like quite\nan exciting journey. Were there any challenges along the way of execution\nbecause you've had more and more people join into the whole strengths movement\nwithin your organization? What are any challenges you faced? And, you know,\nmaybe maybe some pushbacks in how you would have handled those for all of us\nto know?\n\nVivian Alfred 18:10  \n  \nYeah. Of course, as they say, No gains without pains. So, of course, there\nwere some challenges at the initial stage. See, what became easy for me at the\nstart was, you know -- what I leveraged on was, you know, what was easy for me\nand how how well I can soon sell it to, you know, the people around. So, since\nI had with the with the with the Managing Director, I then had used this tool\nfirst on -- apart from the management team -- with a gentleman, you know, who\nwas who was actually going for another internal succession from my India role\nto a global role. And he was, you know, he kind of said, you know, \"Vivian, I\nwant to experience this, and I want to see how this tool can actually help me\nto move on to my bigger role at a global level.\" So, so, that was a very\ninteresting experience because then I started I started coaching with him on\nthe same POWER on the lines of POWER. And so, he was actually heading, you\nknow, one of the regions in India -- one of the sales agent in India. And he's\nnow, you know, responsible for global, you know, sales management at quite a\nsenior level but operating from India.\n\nVivian Alfred 19:29  \n  \nSo, what happened is while coaching him, he start -- I mean, when I had the\ntest, I had [All 34](https://store.gallup.com/p/en-\nus/10003/cliftonstrengths-34) with him. He really found it, you know, he said\nthis is this is sort of connecting very well to what I -- what I am. Now how\ndo I start translating this you know, when I'm when I'm interacting with, say,\nthis global community or when I'm interacting with the people in my\nfraternity? And so, so when I started connecting his -- so he had -- his Top\n5, of course, was\n[Strategic](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252350/strategic-\ntheme.aspx). He had\n[Relator](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252311/relator-\ntheme.aspx); he had\n[Learner](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252293/learner-\ntheme.aspx); he had\n[Maximizer](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252299/maximizer-\ntheme.aspx); and he had -- OK, so, so four are coming to my mind. So this is\nwhat he had, and you know, so he immediately started saying that, you know,\nwhen I started connecting how you can use your Relator to effectively build\nthat kind of deep and close trustworthy relationships, you know, how you can\nactually use your Learner to actually start connecting with, you know, this\nnew role; and how you can pull out those, you know, key pieces to build your\nto build your castle.\n\nVivian Alfred 20:45  \n  \nAnd then again, his Maximizer -- how we could make it more finish how we could\nyou know, how we need to move it to more, kind of a better quality in your\nexpression, a better quality in your delivery. When he started seeing this and\nhe said OK, Let me know start practically putting this in a puzzle together.\nAnd it happened. He went ahead and he got selected out of out of out of, you\nknow, there were around 18 to 20 applicants, you know, who had applied for\nthis role. And he was unanimously selected for the role and he's now doing\npretty well.\n\nVivian Alfred 21:20  \n  \nSo, so that became a kind of a good experience because he started then sharing\nhis experience with others. And there they, you know, that's how the Mumbai\nRegion came into play. And Mumbai Region then said, you know, OK, how, how\neffectively can we see now this tool that can help us move from, you know,\nlosers to winners? Something from a kind of a disintegrated to a well-\nintegrated team. And, again, for Mumbai team, it was a success. So this is\nwhere, you know, some of the things that really, you know, went by very well.\nThen we hired -- we had, you know, I had one of my colleague, a German\ncolleague, Mr. Jurgen Eckert, and he wanted to do something where he just took\nup the role of global mentoring team for India. He was responsible also for\nIndia on this new role, and he wanted to get more connected to his his direct\nreports in direct reports he had in India. So he said, You know, Vivian, how\neffectively can I see using this tool to sort of bring, bring, bring about a\nstronger interpersonal collaboration?\n\nVivian Alfred 22:28  \n  \nAnd I should appreciate lot, you know, two people out here who were, you know,\nquite instrumental in also spreading the StrengthsFinder outside India to\nother regions. So one is my colleague, the the corporate HR director, Mr.\nRonnie Hani, based in Reinach, Switzerland. He was, he kind of actually saw my\npassion towards this. He actually saw how these things were working. He\nhimself underwent the StrengthsFinder on his own, and then he experienced\nthese changes and he started spreading that, you know, these around the global\nheadquarters too. And the other gentleman was, you know, Mr. Tony Jacobson,\nwho is who is also a StrengthsFinder fan. And he is he was responsible for --\nhe is responsible for Asia Pacific. And he's the Regional Sales Director for\nthe Asia Pacific Region. So he was another gentleman who also kind of promoted\nthis thing, you know, within the region in -- also in Asia Pacific. So that's\nhow, you know, this tool is now getting a lot of prominence. And it's it's\nreally interesting experience for all of us.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 23:33  \n  \nWonderful, that sounds great. What would you say now, is really your next\nsteps in in building this, you know, this entire strengths movement that\nyou've started? What are some of the things that you're working on for, say,\n2020 to expand your entire strengths, but not just in India, but also\nSwitzerland?\n\nVivian Alfred 23:54  \n  \nOkay, so, well, I'm focusing on, you know, couple of things that I would say\nwhere we are, we are actually in the forthcoming May -- that is in May 2020 --\nwe are going to have a regional HR meeting, which is Asia Pacific regional\nmeeting. And I'm going to be sharing how you integrate StrengthsFinder into\ninto performance management systems. So how this can be integrated to your\nyour performance management dialogues, or maybe into the process itself. So\nthat's going to be an interesting integration. And we would, I mean, if at\nall, this becomes a success in the Asia Pacific region, that would become a\nglobal benchmark too. So that is one of the biggest focus that we are having.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 24:46  \n  \nYeah, that sounds exciting. And that's definitely a lot of conversations that\nthat we also keep hearing in the market and, you know, also with our clients\nas well. Great. So Vivian, also for us to understand better, are there any\ntools that, you know, are your go-to tools during your conversations\ninternally that you picked up from the certification course? Because we, we\nalways hear coaches say that, you know, this is a particular tool like a team\nprayer or some sort of the theme cards, what are your go-to tools for, you\nknow, to leverage during conversations in your coaching?\n\nVivian Alfred 25:22  \n  \nSo, of course, the theme cards is one of them. And, and, and, and mostly, you\nknow, I actually read through all the Called to Coach sessions that we have --\nthe different themes that come on the [Theme\nThursday](https://www.gallup.com/topic/ttwebcast.aspx). So, also we had the\nMonday theme earlier, you know, how do you how do you how do you sort of\nconnect -- how do you bring more productivity with these teams? So I\nconstantly read these things and these things, actually, I would say I embrace\nquite a lot. Because they they make a big, big difference. And these items or\nthese texts or this material, this material which which, which has helped me\nalso to, you know, develop this framework and and and make it more successful\nhere. So, I should give thanks to the entire Gallup team for you know having\nthat thing for having that access. It's it's quite it's quite an interesting\nthing. It's -- a lot to learn there.\n\nJim Collison 26:28  \n  \nVivian, I want to say, Thank you. I didn't pay you to say that. But thanks for\nsaying that. Mastery -- [Mastery\nMonday](https://www.gallup.com/topic/mmwebcast.aspx) is what you were thinking\nof on the blog post that we do also. So I'll just butt in and say thanks. I\nappreciate that when people listen to those. Thanks.\n\nVivian Alfred 26:41  \n  \nThank you, Jim, thanks a lot.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 26:45  \n  \nYeah, so great.\n\nVivian Alfred 26:46  \n  \nSo so so that so that's how, that's how it has been. And, you know, I'm also\nI'm kind of also, you know, integrating this with the DISC. You know, so\nintegrating the StrengthsFinder with DISC -- being a certified DISC profiling\nuser, also integrated with DISC. It's, it's something that I'm kind of coming\nout with something new. And maybe that will also, you know, show a different\ncourse for people; it'll chart a different career planner, different growth\nplan for people. And well, probably once it's completely ready, I will no have\nanother Called to Coach session and share it with all of us.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 27:37  \n  \nWe'd love to hear on that, of course. Absolutely. So any advice, Vivian, that\nyou you would have on the idea of strengths for our existing coaches and also\nmaybe for our budding coaches who are looking at becoming Gallup-Certified\nStrengths Coaches? Do you have any advice for them on do's and don'ts?\n\nVivian Alfred 27:56  \n  \nWell, on the do's, I would I would, I would, especially on the do's, you know,\nyou need to, you know, connect yourself completely to it -- just just trust\nthis piece. This is this is the most fabulous tool and it's it's the it's the\ngreatest finding of the century, I feel, when it comes to you know, bringing\nof something about strengths, come something about talent teams -- this is the\ngreatest finding of the century. So you just trust this piece. Go with it. I\nmean, you can you can learn, you can learn quite a lot. Just learn, read a\nlot. You know, start connecting whatever you're reading, start connecting it\nwith real-time situations with real-life situations. And, well, you need to\nhave your first sponsor. And I mean, your first sponsor, your first sponsor\nneeds to be very strong. So you have to, I mean, the moment you start using\nthe tool and moment you start showing the results to to someone at the first,\nyou've made it! After that it's just a journey ahead. So ...\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 28:55  \n  \nAgreed. Always works. Yeah, top bottom. Yeah, top to bottom. Yes, Jim.\n\nJim Collison 29:00  \n  \nVivian, we we often get questions -- you mentioned a little of this; maybe you\ncould dig in some. We often get questions about ROI. And with the with the\nwork that you do and the connection they have to HR, are you guys actively\ntracking the ROI, the benefit on this in a way that you can justify it year\nover year? Can you talk -- can you talk a little bit about that?\n\nVivian Alfred 29:24  \n  \nYes, I mean, so o when it comes to justifying the ROI, you know, we, we have\nthe connecting the strengths piece, you know, to saying how you can use this\nto maximize your goals or achieve the goals that has been set, achieve the\ngoals or targets that's been set for the year. So that when we see that\nsuccess happening, that itself becomes a kind of return on investment for us\nbecause when we see people using that, applying that and actually, you know,\nspeaking about it well and and translating that into into success. So, that's\nour result for us.\n\nVivian Alfred 30:03  \n  \nSo, like I was I was sharing the example of the Mumbai Region is, you know,\nso, if you -- a region which was in doldrums and you know, you had you had\nthis leader who, who then took over and the Regional Sales Leader, of course,\nhe was also dynamic, but then how he could, you know, start connecting with\nhis strengths piece. And then when he started connecting his strengths piece,\nhow he started connecting with his team; how he started connecting with his\ncustomers; and how he started developing, how he started connecting with the\nbusiness, you know. This is something this was very interesting even for me to\nsee how it's actually working. There's actually -- it was actually, it was\njust actually working, it was just flowing. And and he could feel it, and he\nsaid, you know, Vivian, I see everything just happening. So from there when it\nstarted moving for -- to the entire team and the team started winning and\ngetting the award. It is an ROI.\n\nJim Collison 30:56  \n  \nSo you kind of justify or you look for these awards, or or they can be a\nresult, right, for what you're trying to do?\n\nVivian Alfred 31:03  \n  \nYeah, yeah. So, it should be something tangible. Very recently, I had a, I had\nI had I had a coaching session with a colleague, you know, and so, he was he\nwas he was actually I would, I would put him in a in just a single word, maybe\nhe was actually depressed at what he was doing. He was not happy with what he\nwas doing. And so, when I ran the StrengthsFinder, and I started having the\nconversation, I used the POWER and how can you make -- how can you make your\ncustomers HAPPY?\n\nVivian Alfred 31:30  \n  \nWhen I started connecting these tools, and, and, and and building the\nconversation with him, he suddenly saw a light in the tunnel. He said, you\nknow, Now I see the role that I am in is something -- he actually saw a\ndifferent role where he will -- he found more value. You know, he started\nconnecting himself to the new role. And he said, You know, I find great value\nin this new role. And the management himself -- the management itself,\nincluding the MD and the head of sales, were quite taken aback because they\ndid not realize a man who was stationed in Bangalore -- he's more than 50\nyears old -- you know, and he, it was difficult for him to, you know, sort of\nchange his mindset. And he's moving from one -- he's really moving from one\nlocation to the other, just by understanding how his strengths can, you know,\nmake a big difference. And he he is he's now adopted a new role, and he's\nhappy about it. He's very happy about it. And I'm personally glad and you\nknow, I must say thanks again to Gallup because this is something what is a\ngame-changer for people. It is it's, it's, that's why I said, you know, it\nmakes people flourish their lives. So that was an interesting experience and I\nloved it.\n\nJim Collison 32:46  \n  \nVivian, what about -- and you mentioned Switzerland and you know, you're a\nmultinational company? Have you seen it work differently in the different\noffices globally? Has it taken a similar feel in each of the offices? Can you\nexpand on that a little bit as what does that look like maybe from a global\nimplementation standpoint?\n\nVivian Alfred 33:06  \n  \nOK. Well, from a global implementation standpoint, I think we have to, you\nknow, we have to really develop this across all the countries, but it's it's\nkind of gained a lot of prominence in the Asia Pacific region, including South\nAfrica. So for example, let me tell you, in South Africa, we have all of the\nemployees who have undergone the StrengthsFinder and all of them have\nundergone and it's quite successful there too. And the MD, the Managing\nDirector to the Regional Director there has quite embraced the tool. In\nSwitzerland, you know, it is it's, it's still in bits and pieces. It's not\nkind of come at one place at everyone going for it. But you know, more or less\npeople have just experiencing it and seeing it but it's, it's, I think the --\nit has to it has to become it has become more ingrained to that part of the\nworld, in Europe.\n\nJim Collison 34:02  \n  \nTanvi, as you've you've you work out of our Delhi office, and you see a lot of\ninternational work around the world doing this too. What have you seen as\norganizations are trying to roll this out around the globe? It's easy when\nit's one -- I shouldn't say, it's probably not easy in one country even there,\nbut talk a little bit about some best practices. What have you seen work well\nas organizations push that out globally?\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 34:27  \n  \nYeah, that's a great question. I think because of strengths being such a\nfabulous common language, it's it's a way to help people understand how they\ncan be the best version of themselves. It's not trying to replicate and I\ndon't want to be more of Vivian, I don't want to be more of Jim, I want to be\nthe best version of myself -- of Tanvi -- and that's, that's something that\nI've seen work, whether it's in India, China, Europe, America -- doesn't\nreally matter. It's a global, you know, unique understanding where everybody\nwants -- and people want, you want to be seen, you want to be heard. And and\nwhat best to have those tools in your arsenal, that that make you articulate\nthat if you're hearing things like, Oh, I've always been good with numbers, or\nI've always been good with people. What does it mean? How do I dial it up? How\ndo I dial it down? So to some of your question, it's, it's, it's that common\nlanguage that that, you know, flourishes globally. And it's not just in one\nregion where I in my experience of 7 years at Gallup have seen a lot of\nsuccess and one not; it's, it's been really quite uniform in terms of being\nstable.\n\nJim Collison 35:38  \n  \nVivian, you mentioned it's been working in South Africa, and of course, the\nSouth African culture and the Indian culture maybe aren't the same. Is it\ntranslating across from a cultural standpoint? Are you getting -- because of\nthe common framework that exists, are you maximizing that common framework,\neven when in the -- when the cultures may not be exactly the same?\n\nVivian Alfred 36:00  \n  \nYeah, see, I can share this experience when I when I had this regional Asia\nPacific session here in Switzerland. We also had the Swiss colleagues\nattending it, along with the regional HR folks, but then all of them, it's --\nthis does not have any cultural bias. I feel, I feel the tool doesn't have any\ncultural bias. It's, it's very, it's very uniform. So people are actually\nseeing it, you know, naturally happening.\n\nVivian Alfred 36:29  \n  \nSo, in this team, we also had a Russian colleague, and she was actually, you\nknow, she experienced it for the first time and she was she was actually\nsurprised. She said, you know, everything falls into place. This is how it is.\nAnd this is what I am. And this is how I'm actually succeeding. If I really\nput the right things in the right place, I think I can really go for the most\nmileage and all of them coherently. In fact, I have asked, you know, I have\nasked if I could prepare the talent toolkit for all of them. So I will be\npreparing for all of them the talent toolkit and also maybe for their\nmanagement teams.\n\nVivian Alfred 37:06  \n  \nSo when I say Asia Pacific, this doesn't, you know, confine only to India or\nmaybe to Southeast Asia, it also includes South Africa; it includes Australia;\nincludes, of course, China; Russia; you had Kazakhstan. So it's quite a number\nof countries. And then from there as a next level, the HR director has also\nasked us to move on to other countries like, you know, Mexico, Canada, that\nside and also the European countries such as Western Europe. So it's, it's,\nI'm looking forward to some more interesting challenges.\n\nJim Collison 37:44  \n  \nYeah, sounds like it. Tanvi, I'm out of questions from chat room. I'll go back\nto you for the next few.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 37:49  \n  \nYeah, that's great. Any last thoughts from you, Vivian, that that you'd like\nto share with with all of us who dialed in and I will be keen to listen on\nwhen people dial into Called to Coach. Anything that you'd like to share --\nyour last parting thoughts?\n\nVivian Alfred 38:05  \n  \nWell, you know, before coming to this session, I was I was a little bit, you\nknow, I was I was a little bit nervous, but the moment, you know, Jim came on\nscreen, it was it was, it was, it was so good. It was so good. I mean, it was\nso -- it's so simple, so, so easy. So, I would only say this. I think, Jim,\ncan we -- the entire team, Maika Leibbrandt, you know, who is also host for\nJim, you know, in most of the Called to Coach sessions. Of course, Pooja from\nIndia, all of them, and I mean this entire team, please keep going. This is\nsomething really -- it is of immense value to all of us. You know, we may not\nbe -- we may be getting an opportunity to voice out such things only during\nthe, you know, live telecast like this, but otherwise, this is a really big\ngame changer. It is -- it really changes lives. It creates a positive change,\na positive impression for everyone. So, thank you so much, everyone.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 39:07  \n  \nThank you. Thank you for all that you're doing, Vivian, to spread the\nmovement. We really appreciate it. Thank you for sharing.\n\nVivian Alfred 39:12  \n  \nThanks a lot.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 39:14  \n  \nThank you. Jim, anything from you?\n\nJim Collison 39:17  \n  \nTanvi, you've -- for your first one, how did you feel on this? Vivian got a\nchance to, to have his -- it's the first one for you. How do you how do you\nfeel?\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 39:26  \n  \nI loved it. It was, and I'm so glad that to have done my first with -- my\nfirst Called to Coach with with somebody as fabulous as Vivian and yeah, and\nhow much that I've learned here. Absolutely.\n\nJim Collison 39:39  \n  \nWell, now that you're certified; now that you're a certified Called to Coach\nhost, we should be able to double our India output at this point.\n\nTanvi Ahluwalia 39:47  \n  \nAbsolutely, I'd love to.\n\nJim Collison 39:50  \n  \nVivian, I also want to say thank you as as well for doing this. We have had a\nlittle bit of an extended break from India and it's good to kind of \"get back\non the horse,\" as we say so to speak. It's just great to be back and to do\nthis, and Tanvi, thank you for taking the time to fill in for Pooja, who\ncouldn't do that, as well. It's always great for me, it's always great to hear\nwhat's going on around the world as we get the opportunity to do that in\neither Singapore or Sydney, with you guys in India with the work that's coming\nout of the United States, and we're going to be in Europe here in 2 weeks,\ndoing some interviews and a live Called to Coach from London. So Vivian, you\nsaid Europe maybe needs some work. OK! We're going to Europe. We're excited\nabout the certified coaches that are in Europe as well. And we're -- that's\nkind of my goal, right. I think I own most of the world. I need to own Europe\na little bit better. So we'll be doing a live Called to Coach from the Shard\nin London during an event that is there December 4, and you can register for\nthat as well, if you don't want to come watch us live. I don't know what 4\np.m. UTC is for you guys. I'm sure it's probably middle of the night. But we'd\nlove to have everybody come out and join us for that Called to Coach as well.\n\nJim Collison 41:04  \n  \nYou guys hang tight. Let me wrap this up.

courtesy of Flikr.\n\nWhile most education systems are full of academic tests that measure a child\u2019s\nprowess in particular subjects, psychometric tests have been gaining\npopularity and are being offered to high school students. These tests are\ndesigned to measure individual differences such as abilities, attitudes,\npersonality traits and educational achievements, according to _Personality:\nThe Psychometric View_ by Paul Kline. Even though they enjoy wide usage and\nacceptance in psychology and are used in schools, military recruitment, mental\nhealth clinics and corporates, and are considered valid and reliable, they\ncannot be used in isolation. Since the scores can be open to subjective\ninterpretation, and testing parameters, such as culture, environment and the\nlike, cannot be replicated, these tests may not always be accurate.  \n\nAt the beginning of my career as an educational psychologist, approximately 15\nyears ago, I was trained to administer school-related psychometric tests. Over\nthe years I saw parents placing a lot of importance on the results of these\ntests, but there are compelling reasons why we should think twice about\nrelying entirely on psychometric testing.  \n\nAs these tests either measure scores in relation to the results of other test\ntakers or measure performances on how well test takers meet predetermined\ncriteria, they cannot be used in isolation to determine the academic\ncharacteristics of individual students; they give only a one-dimensional view\nof the test taker. Through these tests, we might get to know a little about a\nlot of people, however, without spending enough time with the student and\ntheir family to understand their unique background, we cannot gauge each\nindividual student\u2019s capabilities. An over-reliance on psychometric testing\ncan be detrimental, particularly when it comes to diversity and inclusion, as\nstated in an [article in HR Magazine](https://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/article-\ndetails/beware-the-limits-of-traditional-psychometric-testing), where the\nauthor speaks with Aisling McDonnell, HR manager at Version 1, an Information\nTechnology and Services company.  \n\n* * *\n\n**Related on The Swaddle:**\n\n **[A Year of School Measurably Changes Kids\u2019\nIQ](https://theswaddle.com/a-year-of-school-measurably-changes-kids-iq/)**\n\n* * *\n\nA popular IQ test nowadays is the Stanford-Binet test. With roots in the 19th\ncentury, this test is used to measure the intelligence quotient of an\nindividual. Some other equally popular tests are the High School Personality\nQuestionnaire, which is used to measure a child\u2019s personality traits, and the\nMyers-Briggs Type Indicator, another personality assessment. Besides IQ and\npersonality, other traits such as interests and aptitude are also measured by\nusing tests such as the Strong Interest Inventory and the Differential\nAptitude Test, respectively.  \n\nWhen talking about the use of these tests specifically in India, one has to\nacknowledge that while the concept of psychology has existed since ancient\ntimes, academic psychology and subsequently psychometric tests, were first\nintroduced during the British colonial rule. These tests were largely the\nadapted versions of the British tests, and as such, their validity and\nreliability standards were based on an international experiment group.\n\nAlso, cultural factors, such as educational differences between British and\nIndian students, and the vocational interests between these students, weren\u2019t\ntaken into consideration. Post independence, psychologists started adapting\nsome of these tests into Indian languages, in addition to developing new\ntests. However, the quality of these tests was questionable due to the lack of\navailable information regarding the parameters under which they were\nconsidered valid. Even though there has been a marked improvement since the\nearly 90s, with more than 60 percent of the tests being considered valid, and\nnew tests being [developed](https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/ncert-\ndevises-new-test-to-help-school-students-opt-for-suitable-\nstream/story-H4KnoZVrzlN17BArlUAFZK.html), they still face some problems.  \n\nPsychometric tests are offered to high school students in the hope that it\nwill help the student and their family identify strengths and subsequently\nshed some light on their career options. However, since most of these tests do\nnot fit into the Indian career context exclusively, they often end up\nproviding superficial information to the test taker, for example, \u201cstrong math\nproficiency\u201d or \u201cgood verbal skills\u201d. They do not help in clearing the\nconfusion and doubts, rather compounding them. The data that a school collects\nby virtue of these tests is then discarded rather than being used to study the\ngaps that may exist in the teaching versus learning styles of the cohort.  \n\n* * *\n\n**Related on The Swaddle:**\n\n **[Artificial Intelligence in Education: What Does Future Learning Look\nLike?](https://theswaddle.com/artificial-intelligence-in-education/)**\n\n* * *\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that it is hard for a single test to point out\nthe nuances of an Indian student, because of a large and very diverse student\nbody with varying (amongst other things) socioeconomic statuses. There are\nalso different learning styles across the myriad of curricula available. So,\nwhile the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) is\ndeveloping a test to help students decide what stream they should specialise\nin, we may not be able to administer this test to the other students across\nthat region, who do not study in NCERT-affiliated regional institutes. This\nmakes us realize that while there are efforts being made to design tests\ntargeted specifically at the subcontinent, the above-mentioned problems are\nhard to overcome.  \n\nAnother point to note, which is true for all tests, is that testing in schools\ncan sometimes be entirely reliant on the test administrator. This gives rise\nto the possibility of bias that can permeate the testing process, with regards\nto its interpretation and analysis, giving a skewed view of the actual\nresults.  \nTo illustrate this further, when I was 18, I took my first battery of six\ntests aimed to measure various traits. My personality test indicated that I\nhad an extrovert personality; my aptitude seemed to be highly developed in the\nlanguages; my IQ fell in the above average range; and I also had a high score\nin law studies as per my interest inventory. Some of these points I was\nalready aware of thanks to my teachers communicating the same to me, but all\nthat the test administrator did was draw up a list of 21 possible career\noutcomes for me, psychology being one of them, and that was it. No sessions\nthereafter to acquaint me with my strengths and help me build a roadmap or\ngive me information about how to go about studying law, which they highlighted\nwas my strongest interest. Maybe, the pursuit of law would have led to a\nsuccessful outcome as well, but my decision to pursue psychology, and not law,\nwas made in isolation and without any information of what the study of either\nsubject entailed.  \n\nThe results of psychometric tests represent only one aspect of a person and\nshould not be considered as gospel truth. Administrators need to ensure that\nthe results are conveyed in a customised fashion, and then followed up with\none or more counselling sessions. This holistic approach is what schools\nshould be investing in, as it will help students make better decisions about\ntheir future. After all, the human touch trumps a test every single time.  \n\n## Share\n\n  * [](http://twitter.com/share?text=Psychometric+Tests+In+Schools+Are+Not+an+Effective+Way+to+Measure+Ability)\n  * [](http://facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://theswaddle.com/psychometric-tests-in-schools-are-not-an-effective-way-to-measure-ability/)\n  * [](http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://theswaddle.com/psychometric-tests-in-schools-are-not-an-effective-way-to-measure-ability/&media=https://swaddle-wkwcb6s.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/psychometric-test.jpg&description=Psychometric+Tests+In+Schools+Are+Not+an+Effective+Way+to+Measure+Ability)\n  * [](https://wa.me/?text=https://theswaddle.com/psychometric-tests-in-schools-are-not-an-effective-way-to-measure-ability/)\n  * [](mailto:?subject=Psychometric Tests In Schools Are Not an Effective Way to Measure Ability&body=I saw this on The Swaddle and thought you might be interested...%0A%0Ahttps://theswaddle.com/psychometric-tests-in-schools-are-not-an-effective-way-to-measure-ability/)\n\n## Tags\n\n[Career Limiting Move](https://theswaddle.com/tag/career-limiting-move/) |\n[education](https://theswaddle.com/tag/education/) |\n[school](https://theswaddle.com/tag/school/)\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![](https://swaddle-\nwkwcb6s.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tripti-\nmin-e1555509140527.jpg)\n\n## Written By Tripti Singh\n\nTripti Singh is an educational psychologist and postgraduate services manager\nwith The Red Pen.

recruitment processes may appease applicants, but it won\u2019t get\nto the heart of why some employers are failing to attract millennials. Tim\nDrake looks at assessing the mindset of candidates.  \n**\n\nIt was music to many graduates\u2019 ears when KPMG announced on 1 August that,\ninstead of conducting three separate assessments over several weeks, it will\ncondense its graduate recruitment process into just one day.\n\nThe news came after a survey of their latest graduate applicants found they\nwere frustrated by their lengthy recruitment processes.\n\n## Recruitment selection\n\n**[Recruitment selection techniques](http://www.xperthr.co.uk/good-practice-\nmanual/recruitment-selection-\ntechniques/151923/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n**[Policy on best practice in psychometric\ntesting](http://www.xperthr.co.uk/policies-and-documents/policy-on-best-\npractice-in-psychometric-\ntesting/45186/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\nIt's encouraging to see KPMG tailor its recruitment processes to suit\nprospective applicants, assuming the business is confident that a one-day\ninterview process is rigorous enough.\n\nBut while shortening the process is a step in the right direction, KPMG and\nothers should be doing much more to attract millennials.\n\nThis is hardly a groundbreaking idea \u2013 you could ask just about anyone, of any\ngeneration, whether they fancy going for three interviews or one, and they\nwill all tell you they want it to be over and done with as soon as possible.\n\nSo while it\u2019s great that KPMG is responding to the demands of potential\ntalent, it shouldn't stop there \u2013 there's plenty more it can do to better\nrecruit and assess the emerging millennial workforce.\n\nHudson's [Talent Trends research](http://uk.hudson.com/latest-thinking/talent-\ntrends/talent-trends-q2-2016) indicates that employers aren't doing nearly\nenough to effectively assess or attract young talent.\n\n## Embracing digital recruitment\n\nMore than half of 16- to 24-year-olds have some kind of digital CV \u2013 an online\nportfolio, video or LinkedIn profile \u2013 yet 70% of millennials said they had\nbeen forced to submit a Word document CV for their last job application.\n\nThese audiences have grown up in a world of always-on communications and real-\ntime decision making. But still, just 36% of millennial respondents claimed to\nhave been interviewed via Skype. This is despite considerable enthusiasm for\nthe format \u2013 60% agreed video interviewing was more convenient for them.\n\nEmployers risk putting millennials and Gen Y off by sticking to traditional\ninterview processes that just aren\u2019t tailored to their world. These\norganisations will find it harder to engage and attract talent and thus lose\nstellar talent to more dynamic competitors.\n\nThe time is ripe for all employers, not just the likes of KPMG, to rethink\ntheir core processes and embrace the digital age more fully.\n\nCondensing your recruitment procedure may be good for the sake of brevity, but\nit doesn\u2019t quite get to the heart of these other more pressing issues.\n\nMindset isn\u2019t about which university someone went to. It's about a person's\ndesire to take on abstract ideas or to collaborate or respond quickly to\nfailure.\n\nOn the whole, traditional CVs, personal statements and lengthy interview\nprocesses are all tools that are mismatched to millennials. In turn, the\n\"softer skills\" that this generation has in abundance can be overlooked\nentirely, due to the absence of psychometric and aptitude testing during\nrecruitment.\n\n## Psychometrics\n\nWhen it comes to tackling the flaws in traditional recruitment approaches,\npsychometrics are proving an effective way of mitigating that risk. After all,\nthe most costly mistake an organisation is likely to make is not having enough\nevidence to suggest that the candidate in mind can perform to the level they\nsay they will.\n\nPsychometrics offer a way of validating a decision, providing additional data\npoints to confirm that the candidate would be a good fit.\n\nMore broadly, employers also need to start thinking about ways to effectively\nmeasure a candidate's mindset.\n\nA mindset is the approach that someone adopts in response to, or in the face\nof, tasks, challenges and opportunities. It is the application of their\nexperience, their learning agility and their ability to develop and deploy\nabilities.\n\nIt isn\u2019t about which university someone went to. It's about a person's desire\nto take on abstract ideas or to collaborate or respond quickly to failure.\n\nAn individual's mindset influences nearly every aspect of a person\u2019s working\nlife, and it\u2019s becoming just as important as skillset.\n\nEmployers need to equip themselves with tools which can measure it so they can\nmake better informed recruitment decisions, they can develop talent more\neffectively, and they can retain the top talent they already have.\n\n![Tim Drake](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2016/08/Tim-Drake-120x120.jpg)\n\n#### About Tim

Most\npeople-related decisions at companies are subjective, which make psychometric\ntools an important advancement in the area of HR management.\n\nPsychometric instruments help companies measure and predict an individual\u2019s\nbehaviour, attitude and traits. The predictability helps companies make\ncritical people decisions for various HR processes such as in recruitment,\nselection, building effective teams (with the objective of leveraging their\ncollective synergy), and leadership development.\n\nThese are the findings of a study by [Tata Strategic Management\nGroup](/Search/Link/Keyword/Tata Strategic Management Group) titled\nPsychometrics in Indian Organizations, which states that the estimated\nadoption rate of psychometrics in Indian organizations could increase to 87%\nby 2016, from about 50% now.\n\nThe study states that the increasing need for leaders across organizations\nbrings into perspective the transition process of individuals from one level\nto another. \u201cAs individuals transition from one passage to another, typically\nthe behavioural and value-based transition takes the longest time, as opposed\nto the skills and time application transition. Organizations have been\npromoting leaders over a period of time focusing on their technical skills and\nperformance contributions to organizations. However, the work values and\nbehaviours are not given due importance,\" it says.\n\nEnterprise leaders must value, at their core, each behaviour that they expect\nothers and themselves to exhibit and be judged on, states the study, authored\nby **[Rohan Chopra](/Search/Link/Keyword/Rohan Chopra)** , principal and head\n(organization effectiveness), and **[Gunjan\nShroff](/Search/Link/Keyword/Gunjan Shroff)** , associate consultant\n(organization effectiveness), at [Tata](/Search/Link/Keyword/Tata) Strategic\nManagement Group.\n\nPsychometric instruments play a pivotal role in measuring behaviour and\nattitudes that help individuals transition from one passage to another.\n\nThe study was conducted to detect whether organizations in India recognize the\nneed to address these traits and behaviours while assessing and moving leaders\nin organizations\u2014at the hiring, development, promoting or succession planning\nstages.\n\n\u201cPsychometric instruments have gained importance from the perspective of\nmoving away from judgements and subjectivity towards an objective-driven\napproach to make people related decisions,\" the study says.\n\nTata Strategic Management Group found that while various organizations are\nusing psychometric instruments today, the leaders are key motivators of these\ninstruments in organizations and most probably will continue to be so in the\nsubsequent organizations they lead.\n\nOrganizations that have been successful in using psychometric instruments are\nthose with a clear objective in mind, a talent management strategy aligned to\norganization goals and an integrated competency framework, and psychometric\ninstruments that can tie back in line with all these, it states.\n\n\u201cThere are a large number of organizations that have not yet been exposed to\nthe importance and benefits of measuring behaviour. While these organizations\nrecognize the need to create leaders in organizations, the need to support the\nbehavioural transition is limited,\" it says.\n\nThe study indicates that while organizations in India are ready to explore and\naccept psychometric instruments as key tools in their talent management\nprocesses and strategy, organizations have to first critically grasp the\nunderlying specifics which drive the successful usage and implementation of\npsychometric instruments.\n\nIn an email interview, authors Chopra and Shroff talk about the key findings\nof the report. Edited excerpts:\n\n**What is the relevance of psychometrics for Indian companies?**\n\nOur study shows that psychometrics help organizations measure and predict an\nindividual\u2019s behaviours, attitudes and traits. The predictability helps CXOs\n(top executives) and managers make key people decisions for various HR\nprocesses like recruitment, selection, building effective teams (with the\nobjective of leveraging their collective synergy), leadership development,\nculture building, etc. Seventy-nine per cent of the organizations are using\npsychometric instruments for recruitment and selection, and 68% for leadership\ndevelopment and high potential identification. Ninety-two per cent of the CXOs\nand HR heads using psychometric instruments are using these instruments across\nall the processes.\n\n**How many Indian companies are using this?**\n\nOur study sample indicates that more than 50% of organizations are utilizing\npsychometrics. However, we anticipate the adoption rate to increase to 87% in\nthe future. IT/ITeS (information technology and IT-enabled services) followed\nby chemical sector are the top two sectors utilizing psychometric instruments\ntoday. The services sector, i.e. retail, education and consulting, will\nexperience a significant increase in the number of organizations utilizing\npsychometric instruments by 2016.\n\n**What were these companies doing in the past?**\n\nOrganizations have been focusing on measuring technical skills only for\npromoting and developing leaders. Assessing behaviours was a factor of\njudgement. Increasingly, organizations have realized that behaviours play an\nimportant part of an individual\u2019s performance and require a more objective\napproach. Hence, psychometric assessments are increasingly gaining importance\nto facilitate movement of individuals from one role to another. Seventy-four\nper cent of the organizations not utilizing psychometrics today intend to do\nso by 2016.\n\n**What has forced them to change?**\n\nDecisions solely made on judgements can be fallacious as judgements vary from\nperson to person. To maintain consistency and an objective method to assess\nbehaviours\u2014attaching numbers to intangible facets of an individual\u2014has\nattracted interest.\n\nGoing forward, with the introduction of simple and easy-to-interpret\ninstruments, industry contextualization and benchmarks will further drive\nadoption rate of psychometrics to 87%.\n\nHogan, a late entrant in the Indian market for psychometrics, is the second-\nmost widely used tool and is gaining popularity over others, which have been\nlonger in the market. Forty-nine per cent utilize MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type\nIndicator), followed by Hogan (25%) and FIRO-B (24%). Though traditional\ninstruments (e.g. MBTI, FIRO-B) are holding ground, contemporary instruments\n(e.g. Hogan, PAPI, SHL, Thomas Profiling, etc.) are becoming increasingly\npopular as they measure specific workplace behaviours, display clear linkages\nto competencies and generate a variety of reports. CXOs are demanding\nbenchmarks for behaviours across industries and roles\u2014validated in the Indian\ncontext. This will create demand for new instruments like Jombay.\n\n[![](https://images.livemint.com/r/LiveMint/Period1/2014/02/26/Photos/g_management_web.jpg)](https://images.livemint.com/r/LiveMint/Period1/2014/02/26/Photos/g_management_web.jpg)\n\n[Expand](https://images.livemint.com/r/LiveMint/Period1/2014/02/26/Photos/g_management_web.jpg)\n\n**How is it helping and are they placed better with these new techniques?**\n\na. Individual Perspective:\n\nIt helps individuals realize their hidden traits, strengths, potential areas\nof development and hence gives them an opportunity to modify their behaviours.\n\nb. Organization perspective:\n\nPsychometric assessments can be utilized at different stages of an employee\nlife cycle and for different purposes:\n\n(i) Recruitment stage:\n\nIt will help in ensuring culture and role fit. Helps predict successful high\nperformance if provided with the right benchmarks.\n\n(ii) Leadership development:\n\nCreating self-awareness, identifying development areas, assessing an\nindividual\u2019s ability to work as a leader and with a team.\n\n(iii) Performance management:\n\nFacilitates individuals to meet targets, higher productivity through their\nwork environment.\n\nEighty-eight per cent of the organizations intend to use these instruments for\nrecruitment and selection and 76% will be utilizing them for leadership\ndevelopment.\n\n**What can go wrong in using these methods?**\n\nThe scope of our study is not to discuss the underlying science of\npsychometrics. All the instruments demonstrate their validity and reliability,\nwhich is represented through Cronbach\u2019s Alpha\u2014a measure of internal\nconsistency. The key to administering these tests are trust and knowledge,\nwithout which the outcomes could be misleading.\n\nTrust: to ensure employees are comfortable and understand the objective behind\nthese assessments;\n\nKnowledge: individuals who analyse these reports should understand the\nconstruct behind each instrument before making decisions.\n\n**Are there examples showing the usefulness of these techniques?**\n\nIn India, so far there has not been any study conducted in a controlled\nenvironment to assess the usefulness of these instruments. In fact, our study\nis also the first ever study done on psychometrics in Indian organizations\ncovering various parameters of utility. However, from our experience and\ndiscussions with CXOs and our advisers, we have seen benefits across various\norganizations in terms of sales teams achieving their profit targets, higher\nproductivity, reduced attrition, improvement in selection rate, successful\nteam formations, etc. For example, a leading private bank restructured its\nbranch workforce using psychometric assessments and has seen a high increase\nin the sales staff achieving their profitability targets.\n\nA leading chemical player has used psychometric instruments to gauge\nleadership skills across mid, senior and top management to identify high\npotential, culture change and effective leadership. Seventy per cent of\norganizations using psychometric instruments have indicated that these\ninstruments are used as support instruments for all talent-related decisions.\nTwenty-two per cent of organizations using psychometric instruments have\nindicated that these help them to lead to decisions like selection/rejection\nof a candidate.\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Facebook Share\")\n[](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Behavioural assessment  Using\npsychometric tools for leadership development -\nhttps://www.livemint.com/Companies/p38vy2b2QsqLTnssxjw3DI/Behavioural-\nassessment--Using-psychometric-tools-for-leader.html %0a%0a%0aDownload mint\napp for latest in Business News - https://bit.ly/32XEfFE)\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Linkedin Share\") [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Tweet\")\n\nShare Via\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Facebook Share\")\n[](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Behavioural assessment | Using\npsychometric tools for leadership development -\nhttps://www.livemint.com/Companies/p38vy2b2QsqLTnssxjw3DI/Behavioural-\nassessment--Using-psychometric-tools-for-leader.html %0a%0a%0aDownload mint\napp for latest in Business News - https://bit.ly/32XEfFE)\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Linkedin Share\") [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Tweet\")\n\nTopics\n\n[psychometric](/topic/psychometric)[leadership](/topic/leadership)[Behavioural\nassessment](/topic/behavioural-assessment)[Tata Strategic\nManagement](/topic/tata-strategic-management)[HR](/topic/hr)\n\nClose\n\nNo Network\n\nServer Issue\n\nInternet Not Available\n\n#### Wait for it\u2026\n\nLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Small businesses are the\nbackbone of our economy \u2013 we need to do everything we can to support them, to\nhelp them be more productive and prosper._\n\n_\u201cI am regularly speaking to small business owners across the country, I\nunderstand the challenges they can face on a daily basis, just to keep on an\neven keel.  The prospect of increasing sales or workforce can be both exciting\nand also daunting, especially if that means taking on more responsibly, or\nhaving to run payroll. However, with the right digital tools and support in\nplace, you can run and grow your business with confidence_.\u201d\n\n**Overcoming challenges**\n\nSelf-employed research respondents had a wide range of low-level concerns\nabout taking one major \u2018big step\u2019 in their business journey \u2013 putting their\nfirst employee on the payroll:\n\n  * Being able to consistently afford their salary (28%) \n  * The new employee being \u2018good enough\u2019 at the job (21%) \n  * Brexit uncertainty (18%) \n  * Understanding employment and payroll regulations (14%) \n  * Standing out from the crowd of employers (13%)\n\nOff the back of the research, QuickBooks hosted a roundtable discussion with\nowners of small businesses of different sizes, ambitions and outlooks. It more\nabout perceptions of barriers to growing a small business in the UK today.\n\nOne of the attendees at the round table, the former BBC\u2019s The Apprentice\ncandidate and serial entrepreneur, Claire Young, noted the importance of\ntackling challenges head on, saying: \u201c _running a small business involves a\nlearning cliff rather than a learning curve \u2013 it\u2019s hard and fast and you\u2019ll go\nover the edge and either learn to fly or plummet.\u201d_\n\nThe research also found most entrepreneurs recruit their first employee on the\npayroll in their own image, selecting someone who shares four out of five\ntraits with their perception of a _\u2018perfect entrepreneur\u2019_.2\n\n> Speaking at the roundtable, Roni Savage, founder of construction business\n> Jomas Associates, said: \u201c _consider psychometric testing to understand\n> whether potential employees really can do the job.   This is something I\u2019ve\n> found invaluable and have even done retrospectively to understand how my\n> teams work and function together.\u201d_\n\n> The recently launched QuickBooks Advanced Payroll solution gives employers\n> the ability to automatically account for benefits like pensions and\n> statutory leave, drastically simplifying the process of running payroll when\n> bringing on board a new employee. It also provides an online employee\n> portal, simplifying the process for employees looking to check and\n> understand their payslip.\n\nFor more information and details of how QuickBooks can help you switch to a\ncompliant, simple and easy payroll solution whether it is for the first or\nfifteenth employee, please visit http://www.quickbooks.co.uk/payroll .\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fuk-\nstartups-set-for-record-2020-with-1-8m-people-planning-on-becoming-their-own-\nboss%2F&linkname=UK%20startups%20set%20for%20record%202020%20with%201.8M%20people%20planning%20on%20becoming%20their%20own%20boss\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fuk-\nstartups-set-for-record-2020-with-1-8m-people-planning-on-becoming-their-own-\nboss%2F&linkname=UK%20startups%20set%20for%20record%202020%20with%201.8M%20people%20planning%20on%20becoming%20their%20own%20boss\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fuk-\nstartups-set-for-record-2020-with-1-8m-people-planning-on-becoming-their-own-\nboss%2F&linkname=UK%20startups%20set%20for%20record%202020%20with%201.8M%20people%20planning%20on%20becoming%20their%20own%20boss\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fuk-\nstartups-set-for-record-2020-with-1-8m-people-planning-on-becoming-their-own-\nboss%2F&linkname=UK%20startups%20set%20for%20record%202020%20with%201.8M%20people%20planning%20on%20becoming%20their%20own%20boss\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fuk-\nstartups-set-for-record-2020-with-1-8m-people-planning-on-becoming-their-own-\nboss%2F&linkname=UK%20startups%20set%20for%20record%202020%20with%201.8M%20people%20planning%20on%20becoming%20their%20own%20boss\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/uk-startups-set-for-record-2020-with-1-8m-people-planning-on-becoming-their-own-boss/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/uk-startups-set-for-record-2020-with-1-8m-people-planning-on-becoming-their-own-boss/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/flexible-worker-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=UK startups set for record 2020 with 1.8M people planning on becoming their own boss)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/uk-startups-set-for-record-2020-with-1-8m-people-planning-on-becoming-their-own-boss/&text=UK startups set for record 2020 with 1.8M people planning on becoming their own boss)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

A great deal of emotion flowed from the interviews.\nEven though psychometric testing has become commonplace, it is far from being\npopular, especially among those who are subjected to it.\n\nThe reasons for the nervousness range from poor preparation and explanation,\ndraconian testing conditions to feedback problems, ranging from \u201cnone at all\u201d\nto \u201cstill waiting\u201d and even \u201cpsychologically destabilising\u201d. In addition, some\nof the testing approaches, such as multiple choice questionnaires are not well\nreceived in all cultures.\n\nPsychometric tests are used to identify an employee\u2019s aptitudes, personality\ntraits or ability by focusing on verbal and numerical reasoning and other\ncapabilities such as self-motivation or stamina. Companies increasingly use\nthem to make hiring decisions and significant internal promotions. But when\nsuch testing is managed badly, it can have damaging consequences.\n\n**Deeply scarred**\n\nElena, a Czech-American executive from the engineering industry and Pierre, a\nFrenchman in hospitality had deeply scarring experiences.\n\nElena had initially had good experiences with psychometric testing, until she\nmet with a 360 assessment that had been designed to undermine her by a\ncolleague envious of a prestigious position she\u2019d been offered. This latest\nassessment had been \u201cordered\u201d by the colleague and she later discovered that\npeople who did not know her had been asked to say destructive things about\nher. Elena walked into the trap and was deeply damaged by it.\n\nElena\u2019s next encounter with psychometric testing came as part of the process\nof evaluation for a very senior role in another industry sector. From the\noutset, she was bombarded with maths and language testing similar to what she\nhad done at SAT and GMAT level. In her mid-forties, she felt that the content\nwas hardly relevant to a senior role in which leadership and soft\ncommunication skills are far more pertinent. She also had to tackle a 50-page\ncase study and submit herself to a two-hour interview with a psychologist. She\nsubsequently spent two days in bed feeling drained and bewildered, with a\nsense of outrage at having been demeaned on so many fronts. Almost a month\nlater, she hadn\u2019t received any feedback.\n\nIn Pierre\u2019s case, he was used as a guinea pig for a different type of\nassessment, which had been recommended by a new arrival in the company. The\nassessment was administered by a new member of the HR team, who had not done\nhis research, and simply showed up and gave the test to Pierre, with no\ncontext. The test focused very strongly on psychological aspects, and hardly\nat all on behaviour and relationships.\n\nPierre\u2019s sense was that it was neither relevant nor appropriate for a senior\nrole. He was uncomfortable during the test, but this was nothing compared to\nhow he felt afterwards. The report from the assessment was sent, without any\nhuman interaction, straight to Pierre, as well as to his boss and several\nother people within the organisation. This was done on a Friday evening when\nthere was no recourse to internal discussion or debate.\n\nOn reading the report, Pierre found it to be \u201camazingly violent\u201d and \u201can\nexcessively harsh personality judgment\u201d. He was so shocked at the way the\nfeedback was given, that he not only asked his wife for a considered opinion\n(after two sleepless nights!) but also consulted with a labour lawyer. Both\nwere as dumbfounded as he was.\n\nPierre later described the unorthodox methods used to produce the report. The\nexaminers used his \u201cability\u201d to explain how to reproduce a drawing to judge\nhis capacity to \u201cwork with precision\u201d. This assessment was the beginning of\nthe end for Pierre at his company and he still wonders whether it was done to\npush him out.\n\n**\u201cThe best development feedback of my career\u201d**\n\nManaged correctly, however, psychometric testing can be beneficial to the\norganisation and the employee. Christian, a 41-year old French national with a\nsenior role in a global pharmaceutical company attended a workshop with six\nother internal candidates. He was given written and interview tests and\nfeedback was immediate and thorough, given by an extremely interactive\nconsultant, who observed and managed his interactions at every stage. He still\ncalls it \u201cthe best development feedback of my whole career\u201d. He also used it\nto form his own development plan.\n\nHowever, there was one part that, while clear to Christian via internal\nnetworks, had not been made known to the candidates during the process. The\nsimple scoring system (1-4) and its implications did not give transparent\nfeedback to the participants about what would happen next. They were told if\nthey had \u201cpassed or failed\u201d, but not given any context about what that might\nmean. In fact, it was necessary to have a \u201cwell above average\u201d overall score,\nas Christian had obtained, in order to be considered for the leadership pool\nhe was trying to enter. Not all had achieved this, despite \u201cpassing\u201d, and so\ndisappointment was inevitable at some point in their future.\n\n**Seven \"Do's\" and \"Don't's\" for all managers to consider**\n\n**Do** | **Don't**  \n---|---  \nBrief and contextualize: make it clear why the assessment is being done, and\nhow and when it will be used | Send links to questionnaires with no context  \nUse a tool that is set at the right level for the person | Force people into\nrepeated takings of the same assessment or inventory  \nRemember cultural and educational differences when assessing | Position\npsychometrics as a step in the decision-making process - it is just a tool and\na starting point for development  \nGive clear, timely, transparent and constructive feedback | Use assessments as\na substitute for dialogue  \nMake it clear that scoring \u201chigh\u201d may not equal being \u201cgood\u201d, nor instant\npromotion or success | Use assessments as a weapon to destroy or fire someone  \nManage intelligently the sharing of information concerning the results | Label\nor push people into boxes as the result of an assessment, from which they\ncannot evolve or debate  \nUse the tools as much as possible as development tools, even when this is part\nof a recruitment or promotion process | Give feedback without a professional,\nwell-planned human interaction, remember this is intimate information given in\nconfidence  \n  \n**Handle With Care**\n\nThe success of psychometric testing, whether used internally or externally,\ndepends more than anything on how it is handled. A well-designed test, poorly\nmanaged, has as much chance of being a disastrous turn-off as a badly designed\none does. The human factor is something we should ignore at our peril, despite\nthe handy nature of these numerically measured tests. When well designed and\nused, they can be a delightful opportunity to explore development potential,\nas in Christian\u2019s story. If they are well designed but poorly managed, we\nstart to get unhappy candidates, and when both sides go wrong, we damage\npeople, possibly for life. This is not to be taken lightly and all should\nlearn from this \u0336 candidates and HR professionals alike.\n\n_Antoine Tirard is a talent management advisor and the founder\nof[NexTalent](http://www.nextalent.fr/).

The idea that a company\ncould function without a central office full of staff would have been laughed\nout of any conference hall or meeting room. Now, it is becoming the norm for\ncompanies \u2013 especially in tech \u2013 to take advantage of a remote workforce. A\nfew companies such as JCPenney\u2019s tried it in the 1980s and the US Federal\nGovernment trialled remote work a decade later but it wasn\u2019t until the turn of\nthe millennium that things really started to change.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/home.jpg)\n\nStudies across the world have found that remote work has increased\ndramatically in the last few decades. Now, 77% of the world\u2019s global\nbusinesses use [flexible workplace policies to attract the top\ntalents](http://hrnews.co.uk/number-of-remote-working-jobs-doubles-over-four-\nyear-period-with-higher-pay-luring-in-workers/). That figure shoots up to 82%\nin the United States and 84% in the UK. It has given way to a whole industry\nof remote work products and services. Sites like Upwork and Slack allow\nworkers to find new jobs and get in contact with their fellow employees.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why employees are attracted to remote work because there are\njust so many benefits. The ability to pick your own hours is a huge plus for\nmany remote workers and the lack of a daily commute will save a great deal of\ntime each week \u2013 especially for those who live in a major city. Many people\nthrive outside of a traditional office environment and when an employee can\nwork remotely, they could spend far more time travelling as we\u2019ve seen with\nthe rise of the so-called \u2018digital nomad\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s something that a lot more employees are craving. A 2017 Gallup survey\nfound that 37% of American workers and [one in four Brits would switch\njobs](http://hrnews.co.uk/one-in-four-uk-employees-would-change-jobs-for-\nremote-working-options/) to one that allowed for more remote work at least\npart of the time.\n\n\"Remote work promotes flexibility that leads to improved job satisfaction,\u201d\nsaid Thibaut de Lataillade, global vice president for GetApp.\n\n\"Companies have much to gain by embracing remote work, but care must be taken\nto ensure employees are supported both professionally and emotionally.\"\n\nThat last part is certainly true. The benefits for employers are enormous with\nno costly office space to rent out each month. Employers will have access to a\nfar bigger talent pool with the whole world to choose from, allowing for a far\nmore diverse set of perspectives and work practices.\n\nBut this is all part of a wider trend in business. It\u2019s now vital for many\ncompanies to have numerous locations dotted around the world. This is the norm\nfor e-commerce giants such as Amazon with its legion of localised warehouses\nacross the globe. It\u2019s also important for online service-providers because\ncompanies no longer have to be located in the same country they cater to. Take\n[Betway](https://casino.betway.com/) as an example as they serve the UK\ngambling industry from their Malta base. Similarly, more and more companies\nare going fully online such as the content marketing firm\n[Animalz](https://www.animalz.co/).\n\nBut it\u2019s not all good news. [There are some negatives for\nemployees](http://hrnews.co.uk/remote-working-4-in-5-uk-workers-fear-\nloneliness-and-losing-relationships/) with a worse work/life balance and the\nmissing social aspect of office work. That will affect employers too. The\nchanges in the work environment will make it harder for employees to\ncommunicate with one another and share simple ideas. The lack of a fixed\noffice building may also put off potential clients.\n\nBut the trends don\u2019t lie. Remote work is on the increase and it won\u2019t be\nslowing down any time soon.\n\n> \u201cI think it's fair to say that we've been expecting an acceleration in\n> remote work for a couple of decades and to say we're in it now in earnest,\u201d\n> says Mark Maltarich, associate professor of management at the University of\n> South Carolina.\n\n> \u201cAs more companies have had success with remote working, and others see that\n> the benefits really do materialize, more companies are willing to take a\n> risk.\u201d\n\nSo, it looks like these trends will continue in the years to come. It\u2019s easy\nto see why remote work is becoming the norm with numerous benefits to both\nemployees and employers alike.

Not just because university students have finally completed\ntheir studies and are eager to enter the job market; but also because everyone\n\u2013 from managers to junior workers \u2013 has returned from their summer holidays,\nrelaxed and refreshed, with more time on their hands to interview, job hunt\nand apply for new positions having had the time on holiday to reflect on their\ncareers. Even those who aren\u2019t employed, come September, tend to want to get\nback into work. In 2018, for example, the number of people working in the UK\nincreased from June-August to September-November by 75%.\n\nIt\u2019s therefore inevitably a busy time for all HR teams, who will be working to\neffectively onboard and offboard new employees, as well as guide newly\npromoted individuals through role transitions. While these procedures are\nusually seen as strictly related to employee experience, they also have\nbenefits to the organisation. As employees join, move around and leave the\ncompany, their responsibilities evolve and, to effectively carry them out,\nworkers require access to different kinds of resources \u2013 from devices to\nsoftware and folders containing useful data. The administration of these\nchanges is known as identity or access management. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s important\nto businesses and why HR teams need to be clued up about it.\n\n**The role of employee experience**\n\nRecently, the focus on employee experience has increased exponentially,\nbecause businesses appreciate that satisfied employees perform better and are\nmore loyal. The onboarding process plays a key part in ensuring workers are\nengaged and motivated from day one and it generally involves introducing new\nhires to the team, showing them around the facilities and making sure they\u2019re\ncomfortable with their responsibilities. However, there is another side to\nonboarding which is equally significant. HR must work alongside IT to ensure\nthe new starters\u2019 information is correctly uploaded to the database and that\nthey are granted access to the files, devices and software they need to do\ntheir job. The reason why these actions are so crucial is twofold. Firstly, if\nHR and IT don\u2019t liaise effectively to enable employees to utilise the\nnecessary documents or applications, they stand in the way of that employee\u2019s\nperformance, leading to the business wasting precious time. Secondly, it\u2019s\nimportant to bear in mind that workers seek a sense of accomplishment, they\nvalue success and growth opportunities. If they are unable to do their job\nbecause they can\u2019t access the right resources at the right time, their\nproductivity and professional development are seriously hindered \u2013 making them\nfeel frustrated and unsatisfied.\n\nThis logic isn\u2019t only valid when new employees join the company, but also when\nthey are promoted or change teams. Starting a new role within the same\norganisation can be nerve-wracking \u2013 people obviously want to prove that they\nare worthy of their new position and strive to do their best work. However,\nthis may be difficult for example, if the HR and IT teams fail to update job\ntitles in the system, preventing individuals from visualising the resources\nthey should now have access to due to their promotion. That\u2019s why it is\nfundamental for these processes to be as streamlined as possible.\n\n**Offboarding and security**\n\nIt\u2019s true \u2013 visibility of company servers and software should be enabled\nquickly and consistently so as to maximise staff efficiency. Yet, access\nshouldn\u2019t always be granted, but also monitored, regulated and sometimes\nprohibited. Think of all the sensitive information \u2013 on both customers and\nemployees \u2013 a company\u2019s network holds, which would be catastrophic if it fell\ninto the wrong hands. That\u2019s why a fool-proof offboarding process is as\ncrucial as effective onboarding. When employees leave the business, it\u2019s HR\u2019s\nresponsibility to conduct a final interview to safeguard the relationship and\npotentially gather useful insights on their experience with the company. But\nthat\u2019s not all. HR should coordinate the offboarding process with IT so that\nthe system is immediately updated and all access to company resources is\nrevoked. Imagine a resentful former employee retaining access to confidential\ninformation about their colleagues or the company itself \u2013 this could likely\nlead to data theft. The same can be said about employees departing from one\nteam and joining another within the same company \u2013 think of a finance\nexecutive who decides to pursue a more creative career path in marketing. It\u2019s\nnot just about coaching them about their new responsibilities and performance\nobjectives, it\u2019s also critical that their digital rights are revised so as to\nnot allow them to continue to view, for example, other employees\u2019 payroll\ndetails.\n\n**A little help**\n\nWhen administrative processes such as these are completed manually, human\nerror can lead to serious problems. That\u2019s why businesses can\u2019t afford to let\nHR and IT handle them without a little help. Companies in industries with high\nturnover rates or that encourage internal mobility should turn to automation\nto simplify onboarding, offboarding and identity management. An \u2018identity\nwarehouse\u2019 should be updated by the HR team with every employee\u2019s information\non role, team and seniority and must be in sync with the automated solution.\nThis tool can then automatically match workers to access rights, making life\ninfinitely easier for HR professionals \u2013 who no longer have to worry about\nwhether each staff member is equipped with the necessary resources.\n\nIdentity management has a huge impact on employee satisfaction, productivity\nand security \u2013 things businesses simply cannot afford to compromise on. That\u2019s\nwhy it\u2019s time for them to support HR and IT teams with the right technology.\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nseamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-\nagility%2F&linkname=How%20seamless%20onboarding%20and%20offboarding%20can%20enhance%20performance%2C%20security%20and%20agility\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nseamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-\nagility%2F&linkname=How%20seamless%20onboarding%20and%20offboarding%20can%20enhance%20performance%2C%20security%20and%20agility\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nseamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-\nagility%2F&linkname=How%20seamless%20onboarding%20and%20offboarding%20can%20enhance%20performance%2C%20security%20and%20agility\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nseamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-\nagility%2F&linkname=How%20seamless%20onboarding%20and%20offboarding%20can%20enhance%20performance%2C%20security%20and%20agility\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nseamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-\nagility%2F&linkname=How%20seamless%20onboarding%20and%20offboarding%20can%20enhance%20performance%2C%20security%20and%20agility\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-seamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-agility/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-seamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-agility/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wix-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=How seamless onboarding and offboarding can enhance performance, security and agility)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-seamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-agility/&text=How seamless onboarding and offboarding can enhance performance, security and agility)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

Martin](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/author/charlesmartin/\n\"Posts by Charles Martin\") on 11 Apr 2017 in [Candidate\nexperience](https://www.personneltoday.com/recruitment-retention/candidate-\nexperience/), [Assessment centres](https://www.personneltoday.com/recruitment-\nretention/assessment-centres/),

candidates is a little like plucking a goose\n\n**Finding the balance between effective candidate selection and a positive\ncandidate experience is no mean feat. Charles Martin looks at the trade-off\nbetween subjecting job applicants to tests and positioning your brand as a\nforward-thinking place to work.**\n\n\u201cThe art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the\nlargest possible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of\nhissing.\u201d So said Louis XIV\u2019s finance minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert.\n\nThe art of recruitment follows a similar pattern, with candidate evaluation\ntaking the role of the feathers and the level of applicant dropout the role of\nthe hissing.\n\n## Good practice guides\n\n**[Assessment centres](http://www.xperthr.co.uk/good-practice-\nmanual/assessment-\ncentres/116265/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n**[Recruitment selection techniques](http://www.xperthr.co.uk/good-practice-\nmanual/recruitment-selection-\ntechniques/151923/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\nAt each stage of the recruitment process, employers need to extract further\ninformation from the candidate in order to decide whether to advance them or\ndrop them.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the rub; information takes time and effort to acquire and, where\nthe time and effort concerned belongs to the candidate, getting it depends on\nthe balance between job attractiveness and process ugliness.\n\nIn the graduate recruitment process, for example, candidates know that the\norganisation they spend their early years with will leave an imprint on their\ncareers that will last a working lifetime. Wherever they subsequently go,\nthose first years will be seen as their apprenticeship. Think of an IBM\ngraduate, Proctor & Gamble or EY, and a stereotype is conjured up even before\nyou\u2019ve reached for their CV.\n\nAny job applicant knows that companies have culture, values and world views\nand that they themselves will, inevitably, be shaped by these once they join\nup. They consequently aim for a company whose name can provide a halo in years\nto come and whose culture and outlook fits readily with their own.\n\nNew graduates however, operate at a major disadvantage to those just a few\nyears into their careers. They lack the daily contact and routine experience\non the job, the war stories of colleagues that equip an insider with a nuanced\nunderstanding of their industry. So how are they to know who has a solid\nreputation and who does not?\n\n## First impressions\n\nPossessing none of the knowledge of experienced hires, they emerge blinking\ninto the daylight from their studies and fasten on to clues from the company\u2019s\nannual report or Glassdoor, the sum of which is not much compared to what\u2019s at\nstake. Furthermore, the authenticity of this evidence is hard to gauge.\n\nThe art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest\npossible amount of feathers with the smallest possible amount of hissing \u2026 the\nart of recruitment follows a similar pattern\u201d\n\nThis paucity of real information means that candidates are acutely sensitive\nto clues \u2013 and the more unwitting a clue, the more revealing it will seem to\nbe.\n\nIf a company scrimps and saves on your travel expenses, what will be its\nattitude to, for example, paying to train you? If it can\u2019t provide feedback on\nyour application, will it give you any more attention once you\u2019re on the\npayroll?\n\nAnd if it\u2019s using outdated, clunky tools at the \"dating\" stage, how up-to-date\nwill the thinking of your future manager be?\n\nModern applicant tracking systems have, mostly, smoothed the conventional\nadmin of recruitment. But one area where contemporary expectations collide\nhard with traditional tools still stands out: the psychometric questionnaire.\n\n## What about psychometrics?\n\nThough effective, it has settled into a niche as one of the least loved of\ntasks (it\u2019s dull, candidates believe it can be manipulated and and it feels\none-sided; your soul is prised open but usually only to your assessor\u2019s eyes,\nnot yours).\n\nPsychometric questionnaires rest on the happy assumption that candidates\neither don\u2019t mind or, if they do, they\u2019re resigned to it as a necessity. But\nattitudes can change fast once it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a better way to get the job\ndone.\n\nSo where is the better way emerging? It\u2019s coming from outside, taking a staple\nof this generation\u2019s everyday lives and re-purposing it with a twist.\n\nPsychometric questionnaires are making way for games. While questionnaires\nbludgeon through your defences by asking you the same question in numerous\ndifferent ways, games work with the grain of the human mind.\n\nGames are based on the simple fact that when we are immersed, we are at our\nmost natural. In a state of flow, we are ourselves, for better or for worse,\nbut always truer.\n\n## Keep up with expectations\n\nThe workplace has been changing and it\u2019s critical that employers signal to\ninformation-hungry candidates that they\u2019re keeping up.\n\nWhether it\u2019s bring-your-own device or virtual teams, the workplace today\u2019s\ncandidates expect to enter is unrecognisable from that of their parents.\n\nSavvy candidates know that not every business has moved with the times and few\nwant to join a company and then realise it\u2019s stuck in a time warp. So why let\nyour candidate experience give them that impression?\n\nFor these young employees, pre-digital hangovers can stand out as warnings.\nCandidates can use their feet, just as geese can use their wings.\n\n![Charles Martin](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2017/04/charles-martin-120x120.jpg)\n\n#### About Charles Martin\n\nCharles Martin is CEO of

News](http://hrnews.co.uk/category/hr-news/)\n\u00bb How to improve employee retention in 2020\n\nPosted on Jan 7, 2020\n\nIn 2019, 51% of people had planned to move jobs by the end of the year,\nresulting in many businesses having to redouble their efforts to look for new\ntalent going into 2020.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/meeting.png)\n\nResearch shows that **January 31 st is the day that most people are likely to\nhand in their notice**. As the departure of employees within the first quarter\nis imminent for many companies, Instant Offices explores the essential factors\nhelping companies retain talent during a year that is already poised to be\nchallenging.\n\n**Remind Staff Why Your Company is Great**\n\nCompany loyalty is on the decline as many people look to change their jobs\nwithin the next five years, with only 6% admitting they plan on staying in\ntheir current place of employment.\n\n**Discuss Opportunities for Career Growth**\n\nThe end/beginning of a year is usually when most people reflect on various\naspects of their life, and it is not uncommon for employees to feel like they\nhave stagnated or become disengaged at a company, which would make them more\nlikely to quit. This is particularly true for HR employees, with a staggering\n8 in 10 people saying they would leave a job where there was no development.\n\n**Encourage Learning and Development**\n\nBoth learning and growth should be supported in a company to help employees\nimprove and build their skills. A best practice approach to this is to provide\n70% on the job learning, 20% learning from others, and 10% learning from\nstructured training courses. Enabling employees to lead or participate in\nprojects or initiatives or learn from mentors and colleagues is a key way to\nencourage engagement and learning.\n\n**Improve Work-Life Balance**\n\nThis year, work-life balance remains a pivotal factor for many employees who\nhave spent time with family over the festive period. Flexible working options\nhave become one of the most popular benefits offered by businesses, with 63%\nof employees preferring it other benefits that may be offered.\n\nConsider offering top performers a little flexibility to work around their\nschedules, or an earlier finish once a week during the summer months to help\nretain valuable team members who could be otherwise tempted to leave.\n\n**Re-evaluate Compensation**\n\nAlthough there are various methods to boost employee satisfaction without a\npay rise, it does make up for a large proportion of contentment within a job.\nTake some time to review your pay structure and never fill\n\n**Recognise Accomplishments**\n\nRecognition and appreciation can go a long way when it comes to reducing staff\nturnover. Research shows that employees who feel valued also perform better,\nand recognised efforts are more likely to make members of the team feel more\nvalued and committed to a company.\n\n**Hire the Right People from the Get-Go**\n\nTaking time to perfect a recruitment strategy ensures that the right people\nare being hired to fill a position from the start, thus reducing employee\nturnover rate. People who can hit the ground running will also save on\ntraining in the long run as they can start working on tasks straight away.\n\n**Utilise Employees\u2019 Full Potential**\n\nPeople can become despondent at work if they aren\u2019t stimulated. Work should\nchallenge employees to want to continue to learn and develop within their\nfields, achieving their full potential and excelling. Motivated people\ncontribute to areas outside of their specific job role. Discover their\npotential and try to tap into it.\n\n**Share Your Vision**\n\nEmployees who can see the bigger picture for a company and the impact of their\nwork and where they fit in more likely to be more committed to an\norganisation.\n\n**Capitalising on new talent**\n\nIf looking to recruit in the new year, there are a few trends that employers\nneed to consider, that will shape recruitment going forward in 2020. Soft\nskills, pay transparency, anti-harassment policies, work flexibility and the\nfact that 90% of the job market is now candidate-driven, will all continue to\nshape recruitment going forward in 2020.\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nto-improve-employee-retention-\nin-2020%2F&linkname=How%20to%20improve%20employee%20retention%20in%202020\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nto-improve-employee-retention-\nin-2020%2F&linkname=How%20to%20improve%20employee%20retention%20in%202020\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nto-improve-employee-retention-\nin-2020%2F&linkname=How%20to%20improve%20employee%20retention%20in%202020\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nto-improve-employee-retention-\nin-2020%2F&linkname=How%20to%20improve%20employee%20retention%20in%202020\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nto-improve-employee-retention-\nin-2020%2F&linkname=How%20to%20improve%20employee%20retention%20in%202020\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-to-improve-employee-retention-in-2020/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-to-improve-employee-retention-in-2020/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/meeting-150x150.png&p\\[title\\]=How to improve employee retention in 2020)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-to-improve-employee-retention-in-2020/&text=How to improve employee retention in 2020)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

Today, however, not a day goes by without us being aware of people\nwho have been asked or chosen to isolate themselves in order to try and\nminimise the spread of the Corona virus.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ill.jpg)\n\nWhat impact does this have on workers\u2019 rights and their pay?  **Bethan Mack,\nSolicitor at DAS Law** has the answers.\n\n**As an employer, can I refuse to pay the salary of an employee who is \u2018self-\nisolating\u2019?**\n\nIf an employee has contracted the virus, the normal rules around sick pay will\napply and they will either receive Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or contractual\nsick pay. If you have specifically told the employee not to come into the\nworkplace as they have been to an affected area, they would ordinarily get\ntheir normal pay.\n\nWhat is unclear is if the employee remains off as they have been quarantined\nor recommended to isolate themselves. In those circumstances, it would not\nstrictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isn\u2019t down to the\nemployee being unwell, therefore no entitlement to sick pay.\n\nThere may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this\ntime off should be paid. In the absence of any contractual clause, the\nposition will be that the leave will be unpaid (or the employee can request to\nuse their annual leave entitlement to cover the absence).\n\n**For an employer, what are the implications of the coronavirus?**\n\nWhilst the above applies, if an employee is quarantined and their time off\nwould be considered as unpaid, it may be worthwhile for you to consider the\nabsence as sick leave and comply with any sick pay requirements. If this is\nnot done and the employee attempts to come to work, this imposes the risk of\nspreading the virus. As an employer, you have a duty of care towards all staff\nto provide a safe premise of work. If an employee is adamant they wish to\nreturn to work, you may decide to suspend the employee on health and safety\ngrounds, in this instance, they would have to be paid as normal.\n\nYou should ensure that employees are updated with potential symptoms of the\nvirus and affected areas so they can be vigilant. You should seek guidance on\nwhat can be done to minimise the risk of spreading the virus and provide\nguidance to staff on what they can also do e.g. provide tissues and hand\nsanitisers and encourage staff to use them. In certain circumstances, you\nshould consider whether staff can work from home if they have the resources\nand capabilities available to do so. You must need to ensure that you are\ntaking a consistent approach with all your staff and ensure no one is being\nsingled out because of their race or ethnicity.\n\n**_Disclaimer: This information is for general guidance regarding rights and\nresponsibilities and is not formal legal advice as no lawyer-client\nrelationship has been created._**\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fself-\nisolation-what-it-means-and-its-impact-for-employers-and-their-employees-\nrights%2F&linkname=%E2%80%98Self-\nisolation%E2%80%99%20%E2%80%93%20what%20it%20means%20and%20its%20impact%20for%20employers%20and%20their%20employees%E2%80%99%20rights\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fself-\nisolation-what-it-means-and-its-impact-for-employers-and-their-employees-\nrights%2F&linkname=%E2%80%98Self-\nisolation%E2%80%99%20%E2%80%93%20what%20it%20means%20and%20its%20impact%20for%20employers%20and%20their%20employees%E2%80%99%20rights\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fself-\nisolation-what-it-means-and-its-impact-for-employers-and-their-employees-\nrights%2F&linkname=%E2%80%98Self-\nisolation%E2%80%99%20%E2%80%93%20what%20it%20means%20and%20its%20impact%20for%20employers%20and%20their%20employees%E2%80%99%20rights\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fself-\nisolation-what-it-means-and-its-impact-for-employers-and-their-employees-\nrights%2F&linkname=%E2%80%98Self-\nisolation%E2%80%99%20%E2%80%93%20what%20it%20means%20and%20its%20impact%20for%20employers%20and%20their%20employees%E2%80%99%20rights\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fself-\nisolation-what-it-means-and-its-impact-for-employers-and-their-employees-\nrights%2F&linkname=%E2%80%98Self-\nisolation%E2%80%99%20%E2%80%93%20what%20it%20means%20and%20its%20impact%20for%20employers%20and%20their%20employees%E2%80%99%20rights\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/self-isolation-what-it-means-and-its-impact-for-employers-and-their-employees-rights/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/self-isolation-what-it-means-and-its-impact-for-employers-and-their-employees-rights/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ill-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=\u2018Self-isolation\u2019 \u2013 what it means and its impact for employers and their employees\u2019 rights)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/self-isolation-what-it-means-and-its-impact-for-employers-and-their-employees-rights/&text=\u2018Self-isolation\u2019 \u2013 what it means and its impact for employers and their employees\u2019 rights)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

Here: %20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.menabytes.com%2Fsearchie-seed%2F)\n\n27 Shares\n\nDubai-based recruitment platform Searchie has raised $2 million in seed\nfunding led by two family offices who have invested in UAE for the first time,\nthe startup announced today.\n\nFounded last year by Sahiqa Bennett and Harvey Bennett,\n[Searchie](http://www.searchie.me/) uses a network of freelance recruiters and\nits AI assistant to help companies hire for different types of positions.\nUnlike most of the recruitment platforms in the region who charge a\nsubscription fee for access to their candidate database, Searchie is using a\nslightly different model.\n\nThe startup charges $25-50 for every interview from the employers which also\nincludes psychometric assessments.\n\nIt is not clear if employers are supposed to pay any of this fee in advance.\nRecruitment agencies normally charge a part of the fee as soon as they're\ngiven the position.\n\nOnce an employer opens a position with Searchie, their freelancer recruiters\nsource candidates who match the requirements. The candidates are then\nevaluated by Sarah, Searchie's AI assistant that evaluates the candidates for\ntheir behavior, skills, and even cultural fit for an organization. The startup\nthen presents a shortlist of five candidates to review and schedule\ninterviews.\n\n\"Searchie is the first company in the MENA region to use machine learning and\nvideo to predict people\u2019s personality and match every candidate to a company\nbased on competency, behaviour, values and needs,\" the startup said in a\nstatement.\n\nAccording to Searchie's website, its platform enables employers to do\neverything - from creating a job and tracking its progress to viewing video\ninterviews (with the recruiters) and scheduling the face to face interviews -\nin one place.\n\nSahiqa Bennett, co-founder and CEO of Searchie, said, \u201cThis round of funding\nis exciting because it demonstrates the markets appetite for innovation and\ndisruption in the HR and recruitment industry. Our focus on democratizing\npsychometrics and storytelling gives employers a much richer understanding of\ntheir candidates before they invite them for a face to face interview.\n\nHarvey Bennett, co-founder & Chief Strategy Officer, added, \"Understanding the\ninner workings of a candidate before you hire them represents a fundamental\nchange in the risk in human capital. The guesswork required to imagine how a\ncandidate might interact with the company, Manager and team can be mitigated\nbecause we understand the core composition of the candidate\u2019s personality.\nCompanies can now make more informed hiring decisions and build more engaged\nteams.\"\n\nThe startup plans to use the investment to accelerate their product\ndevelopment plans and grow the sales team.\n\n_**Update:** Searchie's website has some obsolete information about their\npricing. They're in the process of rolling out a new version. We have updated\nthe story with their new pricing details as received by them. _\n\n  * About\n  * Latest Posts\n\n[![MB Staff](https://www.menabytes.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/menabytes\nlogo -

News](http://hrnews.co.uk/category/hr-news/)\n\u00bb 5 HR trends to look out for in 2020\n\nPosted on Nov 5, 2019\n\n  1. HR analytics\n\nThe use of HR analytics isn\u2019t particularly a new concept, yet few HR\ndepartments get the most out of their data through analytics tools. This can\noften be chalked up to hard-to-use tools or simply too much data to handle.  \n\nAnalytics is going to keep popping up on trend lists until until HR\nprofessionals learn how to utilize their data in the best way possible. Even\nso, new tools, systems and infrastructures are becoming available as we speak,\nso maybe 2020 is the year analytics finally live up to their potential.  \n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smiling-at-ipad-1.png)\n\n  * 2\\. Upcoming HR Technologies\n\n**Robotic Process Automation**  \n\nPut simply, RPA tools automate business processes. Companies can configure\nsoftware or robots to interpret applications that automatically process a\ntransaction, manipulate data, trigger responses and communicate with other\ndigital systems.  \n\nWhat can RPA do specifically for HR? In short, the automation RPA allows HR\nprofessionals to focus on the most important parts of their work. For example,\ninstead of having to manually update applicant tracking systems after new\nhires, recruiters can rely on RPA to take care of business.  \n\n**Artificial Intelligence**  \n\nSome well-known examples of HR-focused AI applications include reducing\nrecruiting timelines, helping in candidate screening, and helping departments\nplan future hiring needs for important periods. AI also helps free people from\npaperwork so that they can work on more meaningful tasks, and it creates\nvaluable insights by suggesting actionable strategies based on data.  \n\nRemember: true AI can do something it\u2019s not coded to do. This ultimately means\nthat most advanced AI applications are not widely used just yet. As tech\nevolves however, they will be more readily available and will become an\nintegral part of our daily lives.  \n\n**Virtual Reality**  \n\nA great example of HR-related VR is used by the British Army to overcome its\nrecruitment challenges. It recently created four VR experiences based on\ncombat training, adventure training, tank training and parachute training.\nThese were then posted on YouTube 360 as part of their recruitment strategy.\nThe results were excellent, with a 65% increase in applications during the\ncampaign\u2019s first month and a 41% increase in the second month.  \n\nVR can also be used as part of a screening process for other hands-on roles.\nWhat\u2019s more, tailored VR experiences help pinpoint the most skilled candidates\npre-interview. Once at the interview stage, VR can enable candidates to\ndemonstrate their practical skills. This makes VR a fantastic investment for\npositions that require extensive on-the-job training.\n\n  * 3\\. New work, new workforce entrants\n\nAs previously mentioned, new technologies will leave us free to perform more\nmeaningful tasks. But what does the future of work look like? You might\nalready be familiar with the term New Work - today, more people than ever\nbelieve when it comes to work, what matters most is the end result, your\nvalues and your engagement on an individual and organisational level.  \n\n**Millennials on the rise**\n\nIn a constantly-changing landscape, employees who are capable of inspiring\nchange, both within the organisation and within themselves are truly\nindispensable. This is best personified by millennials - yes, they are\nsometimes ridiculed, but they are one of the main drivers of positive change\nin organisations.  \n\nMillennials value digitalisation in all its forms and bring fresh ideas and\nnew workflows into an organisation. This is great news for companies. When you\nconsider the fact that millennials now make up the majority of the workforce,\nthey are having a substantial impact that will only accelerate when the\ninstant access-focused Generation Z joins the workforce.  \n\nWhen it comes to work, millennials generally value:  \n\n  * Flexibility - in terms of remote work and flexible hours for a better work-life balance\n  * Communication - collaboration, transparency and feedback - perform through digital channels, with the aim of learning how they can do better\n  * Values - According to Deloitte, 75% of millennials believe businesses could pay more attention to the greater good and societal impact\n\n  * 4\\. New leadership\n\nModern management is shifting towards a more people-centred approach. This\nallows people from all generations and walks of life to thrive. Who wouldn\u2019t\nwant to work in an organisation that supports your wellbeing and development?\nThese new leadership concepts promote self-management, empowerment, teamwork,\nagile processes and emotional intelligence. Here are a few well-known examples\nof these principles related to the new ways of working and structuring of\norganisations.  \n\n**Holacracy**\n\nIn a holacracy, power doesn\u2019t operate top-down, but is equally distributed\nthroughout the organisation. This gives employees the freedom to self-manage\nwithout straying from the organisation\u2019s purpose. A structured set of rules\ngrants this freedom and eliminates problems like uneven power dynamics and\nduty-related guesswork.\n\n**Gig economy**\n\nIn this type of labour market, short-term contracts and freelancing reign\nsupreme over permanent contracts. This grants employees flexibility and\nfreedom to select the jobs they want to do - and the amount of hours they want\nto work.  \n\nToday, more than 57 million workers in the United States (one third of the\nworkforce) are part of the gig economy. For many people, the gig economy\nprovides lifestyle benefits that can be hard to come by in traditional working\nlife, such as a high degree of flexibility and the opportunity to be your own\nboss.  \n\n**Teal organisation**\n\nBased on the work of Professor Clare W. Graves, a Teal organisation revolves\naround three specific values: self-management, wholeness and evolutionary\npurpose. In practice, this means hierarchies are removed and people are\nempowered to be their true selves while working together towards a goal\nwithout competition.\n\n  * 5\\. Focus on your employees\n\nEmployees have traditionally been seen as a cost rather than the most\nimportant source of revenue. Your employees know your company\u2019s structures,\nsystems, products and services. They know what works and what doesn\u2019t, and\nthey have the power to accelerate change by engaging themselves and others.  \n\n**Employee experience**\n\nEmployee experience is the journey the employee takes within your\norganisation, from attracting and hiring talent, onboarding and engaging new\nemployees, steering performance and development, to offboarding.  \n\nGreat employee experience should be the main priority for HR departments, as\nwell-looked after employees will improve the organisation as a whole.\nAdditional benefits include reduced sick days, increased employee retention, a\nmore dedicated workforce, and easier recruitment drives.  \n\n**Employee engagement**\n\nEmployee engagement is especially important when it comes to managing change.\nIf your employees don\u2019t believe in what you are doing, your customers won\u2019t\neither.  \n\nWith 90,000 hours of their life spent at work, employees need a meaningful\nrelationship with the company they work for. Dissatisfied, frustrated and\nstressed employees will not give their best. The ultimate goal is to foster\npurpose-driven, motivated employees who feel they have the support they need\nto help their company meet its goals.\n\n###  \n  \nWhat you should do next\n\nGet fully up to date with what\u2019s happening with your own organisation and its\nemployees. Once you\u2019re there, carefully think through your next steps.\nTechnology is a fantastic addition to HR, the most successful results happen\nwhen the delicate balance between humanity and technology is maintained. Find\nyour balance, and build your company\u2019s future.\n\nIf you\u2019re geared up to start putting some of these trends into practice, start\nby building a solid foundation supported by HR technology and HR data with\n[Sympa](https://www.sympa.com/).  \n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F5-hr-\ntrends-to-look-out-for-\nin-2020%2F&linkname=5%20HR%20trends%20to%20look%20out%20for%20in%202020\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F5-hr-\ntrends-to-look-out-for-\nin-2020%2F&linkname=5%20HR%20trends%20to%20look%20out%20for%20in%202020\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F5-hr-\ntrends-to-look-out-for-\nin-2020%2F&linkname=5%20HR%20trends%20to%20look%20out%20for%20in%202020\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F5-hr-\ntrends-to-look-out-for-\nin-2020%2F&linkname=5%20HR%20trends%20to%20look%20out%20for%20in%202020\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F5-hr-\ntrends-to-look-out-for-\nin-2020%2F&linkname=5%20HR%20trends%20to%20look%20out%20for%20in%202020\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/5-hr-trends-to-look-out-for-in-2020/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/5-hr-trends-to-look-out-for-in-2020/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smiling-at-ipad-1-150x150.png&p\\[title\\]=5 HR trends to look out for in 2020)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/5-hr-trends-to-look-out-for-in-2020/&text=5 HR trends to look out for in 2020)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

They measure attitudes and behaviour patterns\nby asking a series of disconnected questions\u2014some may ask for preferences,\nothers might describe situations and ask for reactions. Based on the answers,\nthe tests will flag a candidate with a \u201clearning mindset\" or a \u201cfixed\nmindset\", predict their propensity to work well in teams, and even quantify\ntheir \u201cmotivation inventory\".\n\nSuch tests, based on psychology, statistics and analytics, are being used\nincreasingly by recruiters, even though opinions on their reliability continue\nto be a subject of debate. The controversy over whether such tests are\neffective assessment tools began in 1943, when the first psychometric test was\ndesigned by two Americans, Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel, to\njudge the suitability of Cook Briggs\u2019 son-in-law! Called the Myers-Briggs Type\nIndicator (MBTI) and based on the Jung system of psychology, it divides people\ninto 16 personality types under categories like Feeling, Intuitive,\nIntroverted and Extroverted. Today the MBTI is used widely by multinational\nfirms; some companies use variations like the Big Five Personality Traits.\n\n**Hiring right**\n\nHiring is an expensive proposition, and hiring wrong even more expensive.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult in a 30-minute interview to make a full assessment of\nsomeone,\" says K. Narayan, the Mumbai-based president, human resources (HR),\nof textile company Raymond Ltd. He finds psychometric tests useful because\nthey add an important input to the evaluation of a candidate. Narayan says\nRaymond uses a mix of tests like the Thomas Personal Profile (TPP) Analysis\nand the Occupational Personality Questionnaire (OPQ).\n\n\u201cWhile a job interview reveals the person\u2019s achievements, psychometric tests\nprovide insight into their style of thinking and engagement,\" says Gurprriet\nSiingh, Mumbai-based country head at leadership consulting firm YSC India.\nTests like the MBTI, the Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation-\nBehavior and the Hogan Personality Inventory can tell employers whether the\ncandidate has a participative style or a directive style of doing things,\nwhether s/he is more operational and detail-oriented, or more of a strategic\nthinker, says Siingh.\n\nThere are also a whole set of customized psychometric tests. In India, testing\ncompanies like Gurgaon-based Mettl and Aspiring Minds and Pune-based Jombay\ndesign their own tests. There are different tests for different job roles and\ndifferent seniority levels. \u201cIt\u2019s about reducing error and subjectivity,\" says\nMohit Gundecha, chief executive officer (CEO), Jombay. Gundecha has a client\nlist of 250-odd firms in sectors such as banking, insurance and retail\nhospitality. \u201cWe are democratizing assessment by defining key competencies,\nbased on the analysis of top performers. Like for hospitality you need to be\nhigh on stress tolerance and networking, while for production management in a\nmanufacturing concern, you need achievement orientation and attention to\ndetail. Hence our tests look for these traits in potential hires,\" says\nGundecha.\n\n**Do they work?**\n\nMumbai-headquartered Angel Broking is a user of Jombay\u2019s \u201cFeet on the Street\"\ntest, meant to select salesmen. \u201cWe\u2019ve been using this test for the last six\nmonths, and we have seen our attrition levels go down,\" says Subhash Menon,\nchief of HR and learning at Angel Broking. The test has identified\nperseverance, communication and relationship management as traits that top-\nperforming salesmen have.\n\nSome companies, like HR outsourcing firm Teamlease Services Ltd, develop their\nown tests. Teamlease recruits up to 5,000 employees every month and determines\nwhat role is best suited to their skills and personalities\u2014sales, back office,\nretail, data entry. \u201cWe have our own in-house team that administers\npsychometric tests and looks at attitudes like patience and perseverance\nlevels, decision-making abilities and confidence,\" says Neeti Sharma, the\nfirm\u2019s Bengaluru-based senior vice-president.\n\n**How accurate are they?**\n\nCan candidates \u201cgame\" the tests by pretending to have behaviour patterns that\nthey think employers will like? It\u2019s not so easy, say the test-makers. \u201cWe ask\nquestions in different ways to check for consistent responses. And we employ\n\u2018situation tests\u2019, where we ask for their response to a particular situation.\nThere are no clear right and wrong answers, so it makes it harder for\ncandidates to fake responses,\" says Varun Aggarwal, co-founder and chief\ntechnical officer, Aspiring Minds, which works with both students and\ncompanies, testing domain knowledge in subjects as well as behavioural skills.\n\nAggarwal, a postgraduate engineering student from the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology in the US, became interested in testing and psychology while he\nwas pursuing his postgraduate degree in engineering. \u201cTesting is at the\nintersection of statistics and psychology,\" says Aggarwal. He returned to\nIndia in 2007 and set up Aspiring Minds. Aggarwal says each psychometric test\nhas an inbuilt measure to gauge if the candidates\u2019 responses are incongruent.\n\nMettl\u2019s CEO Ketan Kapoor agrees that the tests are all about statistics:\n\u201cPsychometrics may be an inexact science, there may be a few false positives,\nbut on an overall population we will be directionally accurate.\"\n\nStill, there are many caveats to using psychometric tests as recruiting tools.\nFirstly,the test should be chosen carefully, depending on the job requirement.\nThen, the test results need to be interpreted carefully. Even with the right\ninterpretation, test results don\u2019t always hold. Siingh explains: \u201cThe test\nresults will tell you in which category people fall (extroverts, introverts,\nmicro-managers, delegators.) But it tells you nothing about whether they are\ntrue to the type.\" And, he says, the test does not take into account the\npossibility that an individual has the ability to manage their type. So you\nmay reject a candidate whom the test labels as having a preference for micro-\nmanaging, even though he has developed the capacity to delegate.\n\nFor all that, psychometric tests remain an integral part of assessment. They\nare popular not only at the recruitment stage, but also later, in assessing\nleadership skills and in succession planning.\n\n**Spot the talent**\n\nPsychometric tests are used by career counsellors to help students choose\nsuitable careers. Young professionals looking at career changes, as well as\nolder professionals, can also take the tests to determine their competencies\nand future trajectory. These tests, which include the Myers-Briggs Type\nIndicator (MBTI), the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) and\nothers, are available online, for prices upwards of \u20b9 2,500. Consulting firms\nlike Aon Hewitt, YSC India and AscendPsychology, as well as assessment firms\nlike Aspiring Minds and career counsellors like Mumbai-based ReachIvy, also\nadminister these tests, and will help you interpret results, and suggest the\nadditional skills that need to developed, for prices ranging from \u20b9 3,000 to \u20b9\n2.5 lakh.\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Facebook Share\")\n[](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Finding the right match -\nhttps://www.livemint.com/Leisure/wIN0Zzmni77pH2NtscI8dL/Finding-the-right-\nmatch.html %0a%0a%0aDownload mint app for latest in Business News -\nhttps://bit.ly/32XEfFE) [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Linkedin Share\")\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Tweet\")\n\nShare Via\n\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Facebook Share\")\n[](https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Finding the right match -\nhttps://www.livemint.com/Leisure/wIN0Zzmni77pH2NtscI8dL/Finding-the-right-\nmatch.html %0a%0a%0aDownload mint app for latest in Business News -\nhttps://bit.ly/32XEfFE) [](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Linkedin Share\")\n[](javascript:void\\(0\\) \"Tweet\")\n\nTopics\n\n[mint-india-wire](/topic/mint-india-wire) [Recruiter](/topic/recruiter)[Right\nmatch](/topic/right-match)[Psychometric tests](/topic/psychometric-\ntests)[Attitudes](/topic/attitudes)[Behaviour](/topic/behaviour)\n\nClose\n\nNo Network\n\nServer Issue\n\nInternet Not Available\n\n#### Wait for it\u2026\n\nLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

It is the third Monday\nof January that\u2019s been awarded the title due to a combination of cold dark\nevenings, the dread of returning to work after the festive period and the\nunwelcome arrival of unpaid credit card bills.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sad.png)\n\nAccording to the mental health charity Mind, one in six workers is\nexperiencing common mental health problems, including anxiety and depression,\nat any one time. For many, the workplace is the epicentre of the problem, and\nwith an estimated 300,000 jobs lost each year as a result of mental illness,\nit is clear that this is a crisis that needs addressing.\n\nBlue Monday is a great opportunity for employers to recognise the good work of\nyour staff. Such a small gesture will inevitably help them to feel more\npositive and motivated in the workplace. The benefits of promoting good mental\nhealth at work should go without saying: staff who have good mental health are\nlikely to be more productive, motivated and have higher attendance levels.\n\nIt is crucial for employers to know what to do when faced with an employee who\nis or might be suffering from a mental health issue. Here are some basic\nguidelines to follow:\n\n  1. **Communicate** with your staff, and encourage them to speak to you if they are facing any particular problems at work which may be affecting their ability to cope with work.\n  2.  **Train** your managers to identify and support employees who may be suffering from a mental health issue, including stress, anxiety and depression.\n  3. Consult **medical professionals** , including Occupational Health, to ensure you are properly informed about what the problem is and how it may affect or be affected by the employee\u2019s job.\n  4. Make **reasonable adjustments** for employees with mental illness to help them remain in work.

Trickey](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/author/geofftrickey/\n\"Posts by Geoff Trickey\") on 26 Jan 2015 in [Recruitment &\nretention](https://www.personneltoday.com/recruitment-retention/),\n[Psychometric & personality\ntesting](https://www.personneltoday.com/recruitment-retention/psychometric-\npersonality-testing/)\n\n![online personality profiling](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2015/01/shutterstock_95538487.jpg)\n\n**Online personality profiling is growing fast, and a few mouse clicks can\nshepherd tens of thousands of candidates through the mysteries of the\npsychometrics process. But, what is the cost? And what are the common mistakes\nto avoid?**\n\nPersonality profiling, once almost exclusively the realm of psychologists, has\nbecome widespread to inform hiring decisions, a development dramatically\naccelerated by the internet. Global revenues for the most widely used\nquestionnaires can easily top $500 million per year.\n\nThe commercial potential for online questionnaires has proved to be a magnet\nfor many whose credentials are more entrepreneurial rather than psychological\nor psychometric. However would Arthur Daley have resisted that temptation?\nAfter all, how difficult can it be to come up with a bunch of questions? And\ndo these enthusiastic users really have the depth of knowledge and\nunderstanding required to reap the benefits, while also avoiding the pitfalls?\n\nWhen you purchase a car, a holiday or an insurance policy, you need to look\ninto the quality of the goods and the nature of the deal. If you do not know\nhow to do that, you mitigate the risk by seeking advice from someone who does.\nWhen you put your faith in a personality questionnaire, the risk extends to\nthe people you are going to assess, the decisions that you make on the back of\nthat assessment, and the organisation that employs you to do it. So, what\npitfalls stand in the way of realising the benefits of a personality\nassessment?\n\n## Pitfall 1: Not knowing what makes a good personality test\n\nKnowing what distinguishes good test instruments from bad is the essential\nfirst step. It requires a grasp of the theory and technology; the concepts of\nreliability; and validity research as a minimum. It is helpful to know where\nto find the critical reviews, but these too can be challenging. They also\nassume some prior understanding of personality and its implications for\nemployment and career development. Knowing the reputations of suppliers could\nhelp, but that too is more easily said than done. These basics offer at least\nsome protection against improbable claims and commercial hype.\n\n## Pitfall 2: Tripping over the numbers\n\nNumbers can give a spurious air of certainty, but personality can never be\nabsolutely measured. It is important to appreciate the status of test results\nand how much weight should be given to them when making decisions. Test scores\nalways have a margin of error and can be expressed in a confusing number of\nways, eg as percentiles, or as one of a variety of standard scale scores.\n\nThese are important differences that determine what you can do with the\nnumbers. You cannot add percentiles, for example, or sensibly compare scores\non two different tests, and aggregating scores can play havoc with the\nprocess.\n\n## XpertHR resources\n\n[**Survey: Employers changes to psychometric\ntesting**](http://www.xperthr.co.uk/survey-analysis/employers-changes-to-\npsychometric-testing-2012-xperthr-\nsurvey/113719/?keywords=personality+profiling?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)\n\n[**Policy on best practice in psychometric\ntesting**](http://www.xperthr.co.uk/policies-and-documents/policy-on-best-\npractice-in-psychometric-\ntesting/45186/?keywords=psychometric+?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)\n\n## Pitfall 3: Interpretation drift\n\nLanguage is inherently ambiguous. Terms like \"conscientious\", \"agreeable\" and\n\"anxious\", which frequently appear in personality reports, are complex and\nhighly nuanced. Each has numerous synonyms and can imply different things to\ndifferent people.\n\nWithout any structure to anchor your thinking, interpretation easily creeps\npast concept boundaries and into unintended semantic territory. This is an\nincremental chain of inferences that can meander far from the original\nintention - and back again.\n\n## Pitfall 4: Knowing what personality characteristics to look for\n\nIf you do not know what you are looking for, no test is going to find it for\nyou. Most personality questionnaires are \"panoramic\" in their scope; they\naddress the complete spectrum of personality. If you have not already\nprioritised the characteristics that you are looking for, you are in danger of\nbeing swamped by an Aladdin\u2019s cave of options and of selecting on the basis of\npersonal preferences, rather than job requirements.\n\nFor all the convenience and accessibility of online testing, you still have to\nprepare properly in order to make the exercise worthwhile. Some form of job\nanalysis is necessary to consider which competencies are required. You then\nneed to consider which aspects of personality would likely contribute or\ninterfere with performance.\n\n## Pitfall 5: Having a purpose\n\nWhy exactly are you assessing candidates? What is the purpose of the exercise?\nThe answers to these questions have a bearing on the kinds of assessment that\nwould be most useful. Are you most concerned with fit, retention or\nperformance? If you are concerned with fit, is that fit with the culture of\nthe organisation (in which case you might assess values)? Or fit within a team\n(in which assessment of emotional intelligence or risk type might be useful)?\nOr fit with the organisation\u2019s competency framework (in which case a\npersonality questionnaire tailored to selected competencies might be best)?\nThere is no one type of test or questionnaire that can do everything.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAll this has important implications for test developers, as well as for users.\nAfter all, we use complex technology every day without giving it a thought. We\ndo not have to understand how it works in order to make use of it. Computers,\nTVs, mobile phones, cars and fridges all deliver painlessly. The assessment\nprocess can undoubtedly be made more conveniently accessible than it is.\nToday\u2019s domestic and telecoms devices routinely deliver the fruits of\nincredible technology that was once only accessible to a tiny minority.\nConsensual technology, typically, becomes commoditised and, although we may\nnot yet be quite at that stage with personality assessment, increasing numbers\nclearly do want it and would benefit from it.\n\nInexpert use is a concern and potentially a threat to the integrity and\nreputation of personality assessment. At the same time, efforts by\nprofessional associations to control training and access are clearly failing\nto keep up with the rate of change.\n\nThere can be no turning back to a more sedate era. Maybe it is time that these\nissues were addressed, making the process more accessible and resilient. Most\nimportantly, there is a need to provide interfaces that navigate smoothly\nthrough the complexities and, by better design, embrace the possibilities,\nwhile taking some of these pitfalls out of the equation.\n\n![Geoff Trickey](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2016/05/geoff-trickey-120x120.jpg)\n\n#### About Geoff Trickey\n\nGeoff Trickey worked for The Psychological Corporation before establishing\nPsychological Consultancy Ltd (PCL) in 1992.

Some might even say it is the first department that a potential\nemployee gets to know up close and the last it says goodbye to.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/boardroom.jpg)\n\nHowever, despite its importance, the management of the company may want to\noutsource their HR department instead, especially if your industry is in flux,\ncompetitors are getting stronger, and the profits of your company have gone\ndown lately.\n\nThere are some distinct advantages to outsourcing this unit so it is best to\nbe aware of these benefits well in advance before your company agrees to\noutsource.\n\n**How Your Company Benefits When HR Department is Outsourced**\n\n  * **Reaps Cost Savings:** The HR department of any company can be quite expensive to maintain because of its many functions. When your HR department is outsourced, that means your company will not have to pay for [many expenses of the HR department](http://hrnews.co.uk/why-forward-thinking-businesses-have-identified-the-importance-of-making-their-hr-departments-as-cost-effective-as-possible/). Things such as soaring salaries and costly benefits will be the least of your worries. \n\nIt also means that the management of your company can use the cost savings to\nprepare the other departments for a more competitive stance in your industry.\nThe cost savings become a \u201cwar chest\u201d that management can use for other\nbusiness functions such as developing new products and/or services.\n\n  * **HR Functions Can Be Managed Without Negative Effects on Other Departments** : Your company can choose to cut the outsourced HR department down to a level that will help the company survive, or add more functions if the company is profitable, as management sees fit. Other departments of your company will not experience any losses and may continue to function at their optimal best.\n\n  * **Payroll and Accounting Avoid Delays:** Paying your employees will get easier because this function can be separated from the managerial functions of observing employee relations and dealing with issues among rank-and-file. The Payroll and Accounting system will proceed smoothly for the good of the entire company so that there are no delays in paying employees.\n\n  * **Your Company Can Pick and Choose the Best Companies to Outsource HR To:** The HR department functions can be outsourced to the best companies around (such as [Law At Work](https://www.lawatwork.co.uk/contact-us/london)) rather than run by a problem-ridden department in-house. This means it will be run by professionals and there won\u2019t be any need to pay employment benefits to that department anymore.\n\n  * **Outsourcing Allows Professionals To Keep Track of Amendments to Labor Laws** : One of the most difficult problems of your in-house HR department is monitoring changes to labor laws and other laws that may impact on HR functions. When you outsource the HR work, the outsourcing company will devote its resources to monitoring amendments to laws that affect your company, including labor regulations and laws that affect the compensation of your own employees.\n\n  * **Your Company Will Be Able to Delegate Other Tasks to the Outsourced HR Department** : When employee hiring and training is outsourced, managers and other professionals will be able to concentrate on ways to raise revenues for the company instead of getting sidetracked into routine administrative functions.\n\nManagers are supposed to manage teams within your company so that you are best\nable to serve your clients and/or customers. When the HR department is\noutsourced, managers can devote their time to managing those teams because the\nHR outsourcing company will be responsible for employee development and\ntackling employee behavior issues within the workplace.\n\n  * **Your Company Will Have Better Odds for its Survival if HR Tasks Are Outsourced:** A company that is still small will be able to compete better in an industry against the giants if it outsources its HR department function. This is because your small company will be able to snatch business opportunities as a more nimble and flexible organization because there is no need to worry about HR functions. Revenues will be able to grow so that your small business can survive and thrive.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn today\u2019s business environment, competition is very much apparent in any\nindustry you encounter. One way your company can survive the competition is if\nit outsources its HR department to a professional company. Many companies are\nalready trying this out and it seems that the small and medium enterprises are\nthe ones who benefit the most by doing this. Your employees, managers, and\nupper management will be able to focus on raising much-needed revenues instead\n- this is important so your company can set aside cost savings into the\ncompany \u201cwar chest\u201d for future use in revenue-generating activities and\nprograms.\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbusiness-101-benefits-\nof-outsourcing-your-hr-\ndepartment%2F&linkname=Business%20101%3A%20Benefits%20Of%20Outsourcing%20Your%20HR%20Department\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbusiness-101-benefits-\nof-outsourcing-your-hr-\ndepartment%2F&linkname=Business%20101%3A%20Benefits%20Of%20Outsourcing%20Your%20HR%20Department\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbusiness-101-benefits-\nof-outsourcing-your-hr-\ndepartment%2F&linkname=Business%20101%3A%20Benefits%20Of%20Outsourcing%20Your%20HR%20Department\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbusiness-101-benefits-\nof-outsourcing-your-hr-\ndepartment%2F&linkname=Business%20101%3A%20Benefits%20Of%20Outsourcing%20Your%20HR%20Department\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbusiness-101-benefits-\nof-outsourcing-your-hr-\ndepartment%2F&linkname=Business%20101%3A%20Benefits%20Of%20Outsourcing%20Your%20HR%20Department\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/business-101-benefits-of-outsourcing-your-hr-department/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/business-101-benefits-of-outsourcing-your-hr-department/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/boardroom-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=Business 101: Benefits Of Outsourcing Your HR Department)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/business-101-benefits-of-outsourcing-your-hr-department/&text=Business 101: Benefits Of Outsourcing Your HR Department)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

This is especially pertinent to\nbusinesses, with the Myers-Briggs study into \u2018Type and cyber security\u2019\nrevealing that 82% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that a \u201cdata\nbreach would be disastrous for my organisation\u201d. In addition, the research\nfound that 64% of respondents said they had experienced cyber-attacks in the\nlast year, and almost a third (30%) had experienced attacks in the last month\nalone.\n\nJohn Hackston, Head of Thought Leadership at The Myers-Briggs Company\ncommented, \u201cWhile different personality preferences do not guarantee cyber\nsecurity awareness or knowledge, it can be beneficial for businesses to use\npersonality and self-awareness as a starting point in understanding where\ncyber security weaknesses may lie. The mitigation of cyber-attacks is of\ncritical importance to businesses, and Safer Internet Day is the perfect\nopportunity to start a conversation with employees about their cyber security\nhabits. While the guide provides a starting point for different preferences,\nall employees would do well to read the full guide.\u201d\n\nIn conjunction with the research study, the Myers-Briggs Company has released\na guide on Cyber security tips for each MBTI\u00ae type.\n\nExample type tips for people with a preference for Introversion include:\n\n  * **ISTJ** - Don't just use variations on the same password or passwords \n  * **INTP** - You don\u2019t always know best! The rules are there for a reason \n  * **ISFP** - Remember that people online, even friends, may not be who or what they seem\n\nExample type tips for people with a preference for Extraversion include:\n\n  * **ESTP** - Get specific examples of what you can do differently, and act on them \n  * **ENTJ** - Avoid overruling others if they have a fuller knowledge of IT security \n  * **ESFP** - Don\u2019t take things for granted \u2013 it pays to be vigilant, perhaps even untrusting\n\nFind out more about Cyber-security tips for each MBTI\u00ae type here:\nhttps://eu.themyersbriggs.com/en/Cyber-security\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Ftop-\ncyber-tips-for-every-personality-this-safer-internet-\nday%2F&linkname=Top%20cyber%20tips%20for%20every%20personality%20this%20Safer%20Internet%20Day\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Ftop-\ncyber-tips-for-every-personality-this-safer-internet-\nday%2F&linkname=Top%20cyber%20tips%20for%20every%20personality%20this%20Safer%20Internet%20Day\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Ftop-\ncyber-tips-for-every-personality-this-safer-internet-\nday%2F&linkname=Top%20cyber%20tips%20for%20every%20personality%20this%20Safer%20Internet%20Day\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Ftop-\ncyber-tips-for-every-personality-this-safer-internet-\nday%2F&linkname=Top%20cyber%20tips%20for%20every%20personality%20this%20Safer%20Internet%20Day\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Ftop-\ncyber-tips-for-every-personality-this-safer-internet-\nday%2F&linkname=Top%20cyber%20tips%20for%20every%20personality%20this%20Safer%20Internet%20Day\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/top-cyber-tips-for-every-personality-this-safer-internet-day/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/top-cyber-tips-for-every-personality-this-safer-internet-day/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/computer-150x150.png&p\\[title\\]=Top cyber tips for every personality this Safer Internet Day)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/top-cyber-tips-for-every-personality-this-safer-internet-day/&text=Top cyber tips for every personality this Safer Internet Day)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

Whilst companies have a variety of ways to do this,\n> including regular \u2018catch-ups\u2019 and ranking their employees, there is still a\n> place for annual appraisals to make employees feel valued and recognised.\n\n> \u201cOften businesses think that annual appraisals are a time consuming paper\n> exercise or an old fashioned method for monitoring performance, but with the\n> right systems in place to manage the process effectively they can offer a\n> chance to nurture talent and engage employees.\n\n> \u201cUnfortunately our experience is that many businesses, particularly SMEs\n> have no formal structure for appraisals. Those that do often use old,\n> outdated models that are not fit for purpose with annual reviews linked to\n> pay and the opinion of just one manager. This can make the process stressful\n> and unhelpful for both employees and line managers.\u201d\n\nTo address this, Activ People HR developed Activ Appraisals, part of its\nmodular cloud based HR software suite to help managers prepare before an\nappraisal or review, and to record all feedback so they always have a full\npicture of their employees\u2019 achievements or challenges.\n\nThis online software solution is quick and easy to use, as well as being\nflexible to enable organisations to record and manage appraisals in the way\nthat best suits them.\n\nOne business that has been using Activ Appraisals is Lindsay & Gilmour an\nindependent community pharmacy group with 300 members of staff, operating\nacross 32 locations in Scotland. When managing director, Phil Galt joined the\ncompany in 2014 one of his priorities was introducing digital processes,\nincluding a system for appraisals.\n\nBefore Phil joined the company there wasn\u2019t an appraisal process in place and\nhe was keen to implement a performance development framework called the \u2018Five\nConversations\u2019. Unlike traditional annual performance reviews, this is a\ncontinual cycle for appraising staff.\n\nLine managers meet with a direct report once a month for a short conversation\nlooking at five separate areas of staff development including their job\nsatisfaction, what their particular strengths and talents are, any\nopportunities for growth and area of learning and development and finally\ntheir suggestions for business improvement.\n\n> Phil explains, \u201cThe appraisal solution makes it much easier for the managers\n> to keep track of everything as it can be logistically challenging having\n> lots of different conversations ongoing. It also means there are no pieces\n> of paper flying around and everything discussed remains confidential as it\n> is secure in the system. As a business we can also use the data at a high\n> level to identify trends in employee development requirements.\u201d\n\n> Adrian Lewis adds, \u201cThe hectic pace of business these days can make\n> nurturing employees challenging. This tool not only ensures employees get\n> regular feedback, but that achievements are recognised and areas of concern\n> addressed, all of which can improve employee engagement and productivity.\n> Companies wanting to stay ahead of the competition in 2020 should be\n> embracing performance reviews to ensure they attract and retain the best\n> talent.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Activ

In fact, nearly eight in 10 middle-skill jobs are\nnow considered digitally intensive and require proficiency in desktop\napplications like Word and Excel.\n\nIn addition to the challenges digital transformation presents, trainers in the\npublic sector face mounting pressure to reduce expenses and produce better\nresults.  \n\n## **Why Use Formative Assessments and Certifications for Digital Skills?**\n\nTraining programs in education and in the public sector have followed a\nsimilar but flawed process\u2014teaching the same curriculum to everyone,\nregardless of skill levels. Formative assessments enable training departments\nto create a new way of delivering knowledge by understanding what an employee\nalready knows and skill gaps that need additional training.\n\nThis advanced strategy begins with a detailed analysis of skills that help\nboth the trainer and employee develop an individualized learning plan focused\nonly on those skills that need to be learned. This creates tremendous\nfinancial savings and efficiency for organizations, reduces the time employees\nspend in training, and keeps employees\u2019 skills relevant in today\u2019s digital\nage. Ultimately, this makes employees more efficient in their jobs and more\nvaluable to the organization.\n\nGaining a recognized certification in Microsoft applications, digital literacy\nand design programs also creates more engaged training environments by\nproviding an improved outcome through a career-enhancing credential. Employees\nbecome more invested in their training when they are acknowledged for their\nproficiency.  \n\n## **Not All Assessments Are Created Equally**\n\nWhat seems like a simple task\u2014creating an assessment to understand skills\u2014is\nactually a complex process. Does the question really assess the skill being\njudged? Are the questions too difficult or too easy? Should you include\nmultiple choice or true or false questions? How do you weight questions? What\nin-app exercises are most helpful for knowledge transfer? These and many other\nconsiderations are crucial in arriving at a result that effectively defines\nthe competency of an individual.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn advanced formative assessment takes all these factors into consideration\nand uses psychometrics, adaptive methodology, Item Response Theory (IRT)\nformulas, and live, in-app questions to deliver more accurate results.\n\n**Adaptive Methodology**  \nAdaptive exams are at the leading edge of today\u2019s formative assessments. These\nexams automatically adapt to the level of the candidate and allow for\nindividuals of any level to receive extremely accurate results. When they miss\na question, the test gets easier; when they get a question right, the exam\ngets more difficult. It doesn\u2019t matter if an employee is a beginner or an\nexpert, the exam will provide valid results.\n\n**IRT Scoring**  \nItem Response Theory represents an important innovation in the field of\npsychometrics. It is a paradigm for the design, analysis, and scoring of\ntests. When used in conjunction with adaptive testing, highly accurate results\ncan be obtained in a much shorter period. Traditional exams without these\nadvanced parameters can take upwards of 60 to 70 questions to accurately\nassess skills. Conversely, an adaptive exam using IRT scoring can achieve\nbetter results in 25 to 30 questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n**Live In-App Questions**  \nWhether you\u2019re training on Microsoft Office applications, design software, or\nbasic digital literacy, the ability to create questions where the applicant\nmust work within the application are critical to ensure they are actually\nlearning the software platform and not simply answering multiple-choice\nquestions. The challenge in developing live, in-app questions are numerous,\nranging from license fees to providing full functionality of the software.\nBecause of these challenges, adding this functionality to your assessments is\nbest handled by a third-party solution.\n\n## **The Benefits of Using an Advanced Formative Assessment**\n\nTraining is a critical element to any organization. It enables employees to\ngrow and expand their skill set and provide a greater level of value to the\norganization. Advanced formative assessments reduce the hours spent in\ntraining by allowing instructors and employees to focus only on those skills\nthat are needed. By developing individualized learning pathways, organizations\nsave time and resources and can train more individuals in a shorter amount of\ntime.\n\n## Want to Learn More?\n\nIsograd has developed the TOSA assessment and certification platform for\ndesktop applications, design software, and digital literacy that incorporate\nall the elements of advanced psychometrics. They focus on the connection\nbetween training and work skills and can provide any training department the\ndata needed to provide individualized learning pathways saving time and\nresources.

A popular trend in recent\nyears as on average residents in the UK are changing their jobs over 17 times\nthroughout their working lives.  \n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/interview-queue.jpg)\n\nAppJobs **** have surveyed over 2,000 people in the UK to reveal the nation's\njob hopping habits, which cities have had the highest number of jobs per\nperson, which age group is job hopping the most as well as highlight the\nindustries that are the most and least desirable to work in. You can view the\ngraphic here.  \n\nBirmingham is crowned as the UK\u2019s job hopping capital. The city\u2019s population\nis recorded to have changed their jobs, on average, 24 times. Leeds comes into\nsecond place with 23 job changes and the UK\u2019s capital sits in third place at\n21, which comes as no surprise due to the number of jobs the capital has to\noffer.  \n\nThe most loyal employees are located in Belfast and Glasgow are ranked as both\ncities number of job changes averaging at below 12, which is less than half\nthe figure of the average individual from Birmingham.  \n\n**How job hopping changes across generations  **  \n\nThe result supports the claim that millennials are notorious in the workplace\nfor job hopping with the findings revealing over 16% of millennials to have\nhad over 10 jobs since they started their working career. A percentage that is\nnot far off their predecessors with 18.68% of people aged 35 and over have had\nover 10 jobs throughout their working careers.  \n\nConsidering the younger generations have only just started out in the\nworkplace, these statistics speak volumes on how the nature of job-hopping is\non the rise and the negative stigma is on its way out. Research from Akumina\nreveals that 75% of millennials said that changing their jobs multiple times\nhas helped boost their careers as well as Legal Technology Solution showing\nthat job hopping on average nets an employee an 8% - 10% pay rise.  \n\n**What 're the reasons people are job hopping? **  \n\nThe research highlights the most common reason for changing jobs is down to\n\u2018low pay\u2019 (22.8%), followed by \u2018too much stress\u2019 (15.7%). Of those surveyed,\nfemales were more likely to leave their jobs due to low pay (25.30%) than\nmales (20.10%). Interestingly, just 4.6% of people chose lack of stability as\na reason to leave their job, highlighting how the nature of the workplace is\nchanging as job hopping becomes increasingly popular.  \n\n**What industries are the most and least desirable to work in?  **  \n\nAmongst millennials, the Healthcare and Education industry came joint position\namongst millennials, both at 9%. Healthcare also being the preferred\nprofession for people aged 35-54.  \n\nFor individuals aged 55+, the desire to work in a more luxurious industry is\nmore appealing with 8.9% wishing to work within Travel and Leisure.  \n\nThe industry ranked the least desirable to work in is Architecture with the HR\nindustry coming in closely behind. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, 2017, despite employment in this field expected to grow by 4%\nuntil 2026, this increase is slower than the average for all occupations.  \n\n**Speaking on the topic, Iwona Polog, Head of Growth from AppJobs adds:**  \n\n> _\u2018The stigma of job hopping is losing steam, the negative perception it once\n> had is becoming a thing of the past, as more recruiters and HR Managers are\n> looking to the positives of hiring individuals that have had a variety of\n> jobs within different industries.  _  \n>\n\n> _Job hopping can be effective to accelerate your career, allowing\n> individuals to gain experience across multiple industries, building their\n> skill set on their resumes and also work their way up to higher-paid\n> positions quicker_ \"\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nuks-job-hopping-habits%2F&linkname=The%20UK%E2%80%99s%20Job%20Hopping%20Habits\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nuks-job-hopping-habits%2F&linkname=The%20UK%E2%80%99s%20Job%20Hopping%20Habits\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nuks-job-hopping-habits%2F&linkname=The%20UK%E2%80%99s%20Job%20Hopping%20Habits\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nuks-job-hopping-habits%2F&linkname=The%20UK%E2%80%99s%20Job%20Hopping%20Habits\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nuks-job-hopping-habits%2F&linkname=The%20UK%E2%80%99s%20Job%20Hopping%20Habits\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/the-uks-job-hopping-habits/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/the-uks-job-hopping-habits/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/interview-queue-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=The UK\u2019s Job Hopping Habits)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/the-uks-job-hopping-habits/&text=The UK\u2019s Job Hopping Habits)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

The company\u2019s advanced predictive analytics can even show\nemployers a new recruit\u2019s likelihood of successful performance, how their\nstaff will develop over time, as well as their main drivers for success.\n\nThe wide range of solutions available from 10x Psychology can also be used to\nidentify the effectiveness of various wellness strategies in different types\nof people. Businesses can then use this data to identify teams or individuals\nat risk of burn-out, inform key interventions that will help individuals to\ncope with work pressures more effectively, and even encourage them to take\ngreater responsibility for their personal health and wellbeing.\n\nWhether they choose a single test package or an entire suite of solutions,\ntaking a long-term approach to employee performance will ensure that\nbusinesses have a clear strategy in place for recruitment, staff development\nand the wellness of its entire team.\n\n**Peter Saville, Founder & Chairman of 10x Psychology, says:**\n\n\u201c10x Psychology blends the most advanced psychometric science with the power\nof big data and machine learning to help businesses attract, retain, develop\nand progress the best employees.\n\nUnderstanding employees\u2019 individual drivers and character traits is a key part\nof making sure a business is a success. HR departments therefore need the\nability to look beyond initial aptitude tests in order to produce a long-term\nstrategy for the business.\n\nI am thrilled to have assembled a world-class 10x team that will help\nbusinesses to achieve that goal, whilst also taking our company, and our\nindustry, forward.\u201d\n\n**ENDS**\n\n**Notes to Editors:**\n\nFor more information about 10x Psychology please visit:\n[https://www.10xpsychology.com/](http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.10xpsychology.com%2F&esheet=51873900&newsitemid=20180927005391&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.10xpsychology.com%2F&index=2&md5=5fc4c59dad5437900a6ec45d4c8803e1)\n\n## Contacts\n\n**Rostrum**  \nMax Daniels  \n0207 440 8670  \n[m.daniels@rostrum.agency](mailto:m.daniels@rostrum.agency)\n\n[\n![](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20180927005391/en/680981/2/10x-Psychology-\nLogo-2018.jpg) ](https://www.10xpsychology.com/)\n\n## Contacts\n\n**Rostrum**  \nMax Daniels  \n0207 440 8670  \n[m.daniels@rostrum.agency](mailto:m.daniels@rostrum.agency)\n\n## Site Navigation\n\n  * [Home](/portal/site/home/my-business-wire/)\n    * [Home](/portal/site/home/welcome/)\n    * [Submit a Press Release](https://membership.businesswire.com/choose-country)\n  * [Services](https://services.businesswire.com/)\n  * [News](/portal/site/home/news/)\n    * [All News](/portal/site/home/news/)\n    * [News with Multimedia](/portal/site/home/news/multimedia/)\n    * [News by Industry](/portal/site/home/news/industries/)\n    * [News by Subject](/portal/site/home/news/subjects/)\n    * [News by Language](/portal/site/home/news/languages/)\n    * [Tradeshows & Events](/portal/site/home/events/)\n  * [Education](https://services.businesswire.com/resources-education)\n    * [Overview](https://services.businesswire.com/resources-education)\n    * [Blog](https://blog.businesswire.com/)\n    * [Distribution & Media](https://services.businesswire.com/distribution-analytics/distribution-lists)\n    * [Media & Journalist Tools](https://services.businesswire.com/media-journalist-tools)\n    * [Sample Press Release](https://services.businesswire.com/resources-education/sample-press-release)\n    * [Find Your News Online](https://services.businesswire.com/find-your-news-online)\n    * [Disclosure Resources](https://services.businesswire.com/resources-education/disclosure-resources)\n  * [About Us](https://services.businesswire.com/about-us)\n    * [Overview](https://services.businesswire.com/about-us)\n    * [Become a Member](https://membership.businesswire.com/sign-up)\n    * [Contact Us](https://services.businesswire.com/contact-us)\n    * [Careers](https://services.businesswire.com/careers)\n    * [Business Wire Newsroom](https://newsroom.businesswire.com)\n    * [Business Wire Events](https://newsroom.businesswire.com/events)\n\n## Search\n\n[Advanced News\nSearch](/portal/site/home/search?javax.portlet.tpst=503a8767054f0df6a9e77a100d908a0c&javax.portlet.pbp_503a8767054f0df6a9e77a100d908a0c_view=advancedSearch&javax.portlet.begCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&javax.portlet.endCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken\n\"Advanced News Search\")\n\nAdvanced News Search ![Search](/images/icons/icon_search.gif)\n\n  * [Log In](/portal/site/home/template.LOGIN/)\n  * [Sign Up](/portal/site/home/signup/)\n\n## Follow Us\n\n  * [Twitter](http://twitter.com/businesswire/)\n  * [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/companies/business-wire)\n\n## More from Business Wire\n\n  * [Blog](http://www.businesswire.com/blog)\n  * [UK/Ireland](http://www.businesswire.co.uk/)\n  * [Deutschland](http://www.businesswire.de/)\n  * [France](http://www.businesswire.fr/)\n  * [Hong Kong](http://www.businesswire.hk/)\n  * [Italy](http://www.businesswire.it/)\n  * [Japan](http://www.businesswire.jp/)\n  * [Tradeshownews.com](http://www.tradeshownews.com/)\n\n## Business Wire Information\n\n  * [Contact Us](http://newsroom.businesswire.com/contact)\n  * [UK Tax Strategy](https://services.businesswire.com/uk-tax-strategy-page)\n  * [Privacy](/portal/site/home/privacy/)\n  * [Terms of Use](/portal/site/home/terms-of-use/)\n  * [(C) 2020 Business Wire, Inc.](/portal/site/home/copyright/)\n\nThis site uses cookies.

The accelerator\nsupports ventures targeting the improvement of the wellbeing and health of\nchildren and young people. Selected projects receive up to 50,000 CHF in non-\ndilutive funding, access to one of the leading healthcare innovation\necosystems, tailored coaching, customer contact and collaborative lab space in\nBasel, Switzerland.\n\nThree innovative healthcare startups recently were selected for the first\nround of the DayOne Accelerator. Faraz Oloumi from Aurteen, Chang Yun from\nNoul and Christian Vogler and Leo Gschwind from Advancience are great examples\nof how far conviction can get you. In the interview below you'll learn more\nabout the entrepreneurs behind those three startups and about their\nparticipation at DayOne Accelerator.\n\n**Faraz, what is Aurteen and what was your motivation to start it?**\n\n_**Faraz:**_ During my studies in electrical and computer engineering, I\nworked on retinal-image analysis and fell in love with the subject. I\ncompleted my Masters, then my PhD and declined a safe job to pursue the topic\nand founded Aurteen. I am 100% convinced of the novelty and necessity of\ncomputer-aided assessment of the retina, because the vessels at the back of\nthe eye tell the story of your overall health from retinal disease to\nmetabolical and cardiovascular disorders.\n\n**Christian, what was your starting point with Advancience?**\n\n_**Christian:**_ I studied psychology and genetics. In order to use genetics\nas a tool to research the human mind, my co-founders and I started to pursue\npsychometrics. The typical toolkit for psychometric testing originates in the\n1940s to 1970s. We took psychometric tests to the 21st century, added\ngamification, made it entertaining and scalable and thus are able to process\nlarge numbers of study participants. We want to drive psychology forward. We\nare convinced that you can use our tools for a broad range of different\npurposes: It is a diagnostic tool for testing attention disorders or memory\nimpairments as well as an HR tool to make teams work better together.\n\n**Chang, you joined Noul one year ago. What convinced you to join the\nstartup?**\n\n_**Chang:**_ One of the co-founders is a biomedical engineer. Right after he\nhad earned his PhD in the United States he spent 1,5 years in Malawi for his\nvoluntary social service. He witnessed many children die from malaria and was\nsurprised to see health workers still rely on tests that were inaccurate and\ninefficient. He founded Noul in 2015 to develop a portable device that uses\nimage analysis and artificial intelligence to diagnose diseases from blood\nsamples. As his close friend I have been interested in this project from the\nbeginning and joined one year ago being ascertain that my career in the United\nNations would be conducive for success of the project. I have a background in\nbusiness management and public administration. As the Director of Global\nBusiness Development at Noul I now set up the European office.\n\n**What were the most challenging factors in the very early days of your\ncompanies?**\n\n_**Chang:**_ For us, it was the science. We had trials and errors. While the\nclinical trials in the laboratory worked well, the results in the field were\noften unexpected. Sometimes it was hard to get enough samples with high\nquality. To overcome those hurdles, we cooperate with the Swiss Tropical and\nPublic Health Institute in Basel. In addition, to approve a new technology\nlike ours also requires new criteria. That takes a lot of time and sufficient\nconvincing data from our side.\n\n_**Christian:**_ As a scientist, you don\u2019t become an entrepreneur overnight. I\nhad to learn that the scientific results are not the only thing that counts.\nInstead, I also need to sell my results and think about specific value\npropositions. I\u2019m familiar with psychology, genetics and bioinformatics \u2013 and\nnow I have to come up with business cases on top of that. In the corporate\nworld, we encounter a new problem every day. You always need a plan B, C and\nD. It is a tremendous amount of work, but a lot of fun, too.\n\n_**Faraz:**_ Not being able to financially support yourself is not easy. I\nhaven\u2019t paid myself a dime in the past years. The hardest part for me though\nwas convincing people that my ideas and vision are not crazy. I had to fight a\nlot of adversity. But I don\u2019t regret it at all. Then there are other\nchallenges like making myself be a CEO rather than just being a CTO, which\nmeans that you can no longer be a perfectionist. That is a challenge I enjoy.\n\n**What are you planning to achieve during your time in the DayOne\nAccelerator?**\n\n_**Faraz:**_ While Canada is well suited to the telemedical approach and my\ncollaborators and potential customers are there, we don\u2019t have a strong\nbusiness case in Canada in terms of pure numbers. Plus, the nearest market,\nwhich is the US, is very fragmented and complicated to enter. To participate\nin the DayOne Accelerator is the perfect opportunity for us to look at and\nvalidate the European market. Further, we want to validate our list of value\npropositions and find investors.\n\n_**Chang:**_ Our Swiss partners encouraged us to apply for this program and\nluckily we were selected to take part. I believe Noul has worked very hard for\ndeveloping unprecedented diagnostic solutions for last three years. Now the\ntime is right to look back at what we have achieved so far and use the input\nwe get here to make our business model more concrete. We want to get to know\nthe people that can further help us to reach that goal and explore the\nopportunities.\n\n_**Leo:**_ We want to learn how to set up and run the business. And we want to\nget ready to pitch to potential investors and look for seed money.\n\n**The acceleration program started in January. What is your experience so\nfar?**\n\n_**Faraz:**_ It all came as a pleasant surprise. The ecosystem in terms of\nsupport for startups is completely different from what I am used to. I am\ntalking to senior figures from the pharma and clinical side and the overall\nsupport happens to be on a high level. The DayOne team cares for me and my\nbusiness to succeed. I am convinced that we can gain more traction here. Based\non my experience so far, I am exploring the idea of establishing here in\nBasel. It really is a blessing for our team.\n\n_**Chang:**_ I am impressed. The meetings we had so far are extremely\nbeneficial and helpful. Strategically, it pays off to be in Basel and be close\nto our partner, the Swiss TPH and in traveling distance to our stakeholders in\nGeneva. So far, the accelerator proves to be very effective.\n\n_**Leo:**_ The input is enormous. We benefit tremendously in learning how to\nstructure the business. It\u2019s brilliant to learn the trade from experts and get\nfirst-hand insights. And the funding relieves the hardest pain.\n\n[Advancience](https://www.advancience.io/) is a startup from Basel with a\nfocus on digital tools for psychology. Founded in 2019, the company uses data\nthat is gathered while playing computer games to measure cognitive functions,\nwhich for example can help to diagnose psychiatric disorders.\n\n[Aurteen](https://aurteen.com/) is based in Alberta, Canada and develops\nsoftware that improves the detection, monitoring and treatment of retinopathy\nwith preterm infants, which is the leading cause of preventable childhood\nblindness worldwide. Aurteen hopes to collaborate with clinical and technical\nexperts in the Basel area to bring its software closer to commercialization.\n\n[Noul](http://noul.kr/) from South Korea works with the Swiss Tropical and\nPublic Health Institute to improve the diagnosis of Malaria, a major cause of\ndeath among children in low and middle income countries. The Noul team have\ndeveloped a portable device that uses image analysis combined with artificial\nintelligence to diagnose diseases from blood samples.\n\n**DayOne Accelerator - Additional Info:**\n\nIf you're interested to join the 2nd batch of the DayOne Accelerator, make\nsure to **[apply until July\n26th](https://www.dayone.swiss/dayone/accelerator.html?utm_source=Eu-\nstartups&utm_medium=Post&utm_campaign=Eu-startups_Post)**.

More\nspecifically, it aims to tackle the grey areas and blurred boundaries of\nemployment status that is often leveraged by employers within the Gig Economy.\n\n\u201cThe prevailing aim of the Plan is to erase this ambiguity that employers are\nable to exploit and ensure that all workers are provided with a fair and\ndecent professional environment,\u201d explains Deval Patel, a Partner at Top 60\naccountancy and business services firm Gerald Edelman.\n\n\u201cPart of the Plan comes into force on 6th April, so now is the time for\nbusinesses to start planning to ensure compliance with these changes to\nlegislation.\u201d\n\nCurrently, an employer has 56 days to provide a new worker or employee with\ntheir Terms of Employment.  However, from April 2020 this will change, and the\nemployer will have to provide this on, or before the worker\u2019s/employee\u2019s first\nday of work. Additionally, it is important to note that this will extend to\nworkers, not just employees.\n\nIn addition, information provided within the Terms of Employment will be\nupdated and must include:  \n\u2022 details of any probationary period, including its duration and any\nconditions that apply (such as a shorter notice period) during the probation;  \n\u2022 details of all paid leave, including details of pay for any form of family\nleave;  \n\u2022 training entitlements and details of compulsory training, including whether\nthe employer will pay for it;  \n\u2022 details of all benefits provided, be they contractual or non-contractual;  \n\u2022 terms relating to any work the worker will be required to complete outside\nthe UK for periods of more than one month.\n\n> \u201cAn important point to note is that the revised Terms of Employment now\n> needs a higher level of detail and removes the scope to rely on\n> supplementary documents such as a handbook,\u201d explains Patel.\n\nThe reference period for calculating average weekly pay will also change from\n12 to 52 weeks. The reasoning for this is so staff are not disadvantaged if\nthey take holiday during quieter times.\n\nThe time required to rely on a break of service is being extended from one\nweek to four weeks. The purpose of this update is to deter employers from\nabusing the system by dismissing employees and then almost immediately re-\nengaging them to \u201creset the clock\u201d on their employment rights and avoid\naccusations of unfair dismissal.

by sending staff on first aid courses specialising in non-\njudgmental listening and spotting triggers of mental health problems.  \n\n> Gillian said: \u201cMental health is one of the biggest issues facing the UK\n> workforce today. Workplace stress coupled with the struggles of everyday\n> life means around 59% of workers now suffer from a mental health condition,\n> yet bosses often fail to recognise when employees are struggling.  \n>\n\n> \u201cMental health is a broad church and can range from depression, to\n> borderline personality disorders, and eating problems, to loneliness,\n> anxiety, paranoia, and stress.  \n>\n\n> \u201cOur Citation research shows the majority of the UK workforce is now living\n> with a mental health condition of some sort, and bosses have a legal\n> obligation to support and protect employees experiencing mental health\n> problems.  \n>\n\n> \u201cOne thing we have done at Citation is recruit Mental Health First Aiders\n> amongst the workforce. It\u2019s the same, in theory, as a traditional First\n> Aider, but the focus is on topics surrounding mental health.  \n>\n\n> \u201cWhether someone is feeling stressed, anxious, or is struggling with a more\n> chronic mental health issue, our Mental Health First Aiders are here to spot\n> the signs and reach out to provide support and assistance, whether it\u2019s\n> offering a shoulder to cry on or guiding people to further support through\n> the NHS or charities.\u201d  \n>\n\nResearch from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) shows a staggering 11\nmillion days are lost at work every year because of workplace stress. By\nplacing mental wellbeing at the top of the list of priorities, Gillian\nbelieves companies will ultimately benefit from having well-rested employees\nwho feel listened to and valued by their bosses.  \n\n> Gillian said: \u201cIt is imperative that we remove the stigma attached to mental\n> health. Our research shows around 40% of people with a mental health\n> condition do not feel comfortable talking to their manager about it. This\n> needs to change.  \n>\n\n> \u201cSpeaking openly about mental health can be a lifeline, that\u2019s why we\u2019re\n> keen to see workplaces across the country sending staff on courses that will\n> help them spot the signs when their colleagues are struggling.  \n>\n\n> \u201cSt John\u2019s Ambulance runs excellent courses dedicated to mental health first\n> aid. Just a two-day course can make a huge difference, giving staff and\n> managers the skills to take their employees and colleagues aside, put the\n> kettle on and listen in a helpful and non-judgmental way.\u201d  \n>\n\nFor further employment advice, visit www.citation.co.uk\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbosses-\nurged-to-sent-staff-on-mental-health-first-aid-\ncourses%2F&linkname=Bosses%20urged%20to%20sent%20staff%20on%20%E2%80%98Mental%20Health%20first%20aid%E2%80%99%20courses\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbosses-\nurged-to-sent-staff-on-mental-health-first-aid-\ncourses%2F&linkname=Bosses%20urged%20to%20sent%20staff%20on%20%E2%80%98Mental%20Health%20first%20aid%E2%80%99%20courses\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbosses-\nurged-to-sent-staff-on-mental-health-first-aid-\ncourses%2F&linkname=Bosses%20urged%20to%20sent%20staff%20on%20%E2%80%98Mental%20Health%20first%20aid%E2%80%99%20courses\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbosses-\nurged-to-sent-staff-on-mental-health-first-aid-\ncourses%2F&linkname=Bosses%20urged%20to%20sent%20staff%20on%20%E2%80%98Mental%20Health%20first%20aid%E2%80%99%20courses\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbosses-\nurged-to-sent-staff-on-mental-health-first-aid-\ncourses%2F&linkname=Bosses%20urged%20to%20sent%20staff%20on%20%E2%80%98Mental%20Health%20first%20aid%E2%80%99%20courses\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/bosses-urged-to-sent-staff-on-mental-health-first-aid-courses/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/bosses-urged-to-sent-staff-on-mental-health-first-aid-courses/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sad-1-150x150.png&p\\[title\\]=Bosses urged to sent staff on \u2018Mental Health first aid\u2019 courses)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/bosses-urged-to-sent-staff-on-mental-health-first-aid-courses/&text=Bosses urged to sent staff on \u2018Mental Health first aid\u2019 courses)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

Assess CVs. Interview candidates. Recruit. Repeat.\n\nIt\u2019s the tedious recruitment model used by millions of organisations through\nthe past few decades.\n\nBut with companies now spending $1,700 ($US1,200) annually on training each\nnew employee, it is little surprise that the \u2018traditional\u2019 recruitment model\nis starting to be seriously questioned.\n\n[Deloitte has\nrevealed](http://marketing.bersin.com/rs/976-LMP-699/images/HRTechDisruptions2018-Report-100517.pdf)\nin its HR Tech Disruptions Report that the recruitment market now faces\nsignificant disruption, with innovative tools such as video assessment now\nattracting solid investment from countries around the world.\n\n\u201cThe recruitment software market is the most dynamic and exciting space in HR\ntech today, probably because there are so many niches to cover,\u201d the report\nexplains.\n\nAnd barriers to entry are being kept relatively low as \u201cmillions of companies\naround the world need recruiting tools, so even a small recruiting software\nvendor can grow,\u201d Deloitte says.\n\nThe report lists some of the \u201cmore disruptive\u201d players in the recruitment\ngame.\n\n**Putting neuroscience to work**\n\nOn the list is [Pymetrics](https://www.pymetrics.com/employers/) \u2013 a start-up\nthat combines neuroscience and AI to deliver targeted recruitment solutions\nfor the likes of LinkedIn, Accenture, Tesla, Rio Tinto and Unilever.\n\nCompany founder Frida Polli spent a decade as an academic neuroscientist at\nHarvard and MIT.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until she chased a passion for business and commenced her MBA at\nHarvard that she came up with the idea for Pymetrics.\n\nSpeaking with _Information Age\u00ad_ , Pymetrics APAC Managing Director Grace\nKerrison gets to the crux of what the company is and why it\u2019s different.\n\n\u201cInstead of going to the same schools or to the same industries in the same\ncompanies to attract talent, this now gives you a view to cast a really wide\nnet and use us as a first filter,\u201d she explains.\n\nPymetrics is a series of games for applicants to complete as an initial step\nin the recruitment process.\n\nThere is no winning or losing the games, nor are there right or wrong answers.\n\nRather, each game uses neuroscience to highlight the specific traits of\napplicants, and match them to the roles which they are best suited.\n\nThe formula is simple.\n\nSuccessful incumbent employees in the company complete the games.\n\nThe traits of the incumbent employees are recorded, before a bias-free\nalgorithm matches applicants who have demonstrated similar traits.\n\nAnd although there are no right or wrong answers, candidates are placed in a\nlow to high range on a number of key characteristics, including attention,\ndistraction filtering, multitasking, memory, planning speed, effort, emotion\nidentification, altruism and fairness.\n\n**Six seconds per CV**\n\nAmongst other things, it is the relative simplicity of the Pymetrics model\nthat truly highlights the existing problems with recruitment.\n\n\u201cA recruiter spends all of six or seven seconds reviewing one CV to see\nwhether they\u2019re going to be successful inside a company and 40-50% of the time\nit\u2019s actually not accurate,\u201d Kerrison continues.\n\n\u201cA CV is the least predictive of success. But as you go higher up and the more\nmulti assessment measures that you use, you become more predictable.\u201d\n\nNot only can Pymetrics help recruiters filter through swarms of applications,\nit can also give candidates a nudge in the right direction.\n\nA study by the Association of Graduate Recruiters in the UK found that\nemployers lose 16% of all graduates within two years.\n\nAnd while there are a number of factors that contribute to these high\nattrition rates, the reality is many graduates enter the workforce still\nunsure on what role they are suited to.\n\n![](/content/dam/ia/article/images/Grace_Kerrison%20Photo.jpg)\n\nPymetrics APAC Managing Director Grace Kerrison. Source: Supplied\n\nPymetrics is now working with some of its biggest clients, such as Unilever\nand Accenture, to match graduates across multiple roles.\n\n\u201cWith one gameplay for a graduate, we can match them across seven roles,\u201d\nexplains Kerrison.\n\n\u201cAt the backend we have a \u2018fit score\u2019 that says \u2018highly-recommend\u2019,\n\u2018recommend\u2019 or \u2018do not recommend\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe can see what would be the most successful role that person can take within\nthat company.\u201d\n\nCandidates also receive a unique trait report after completing the games,\nmapping their performance against the specific metrics.\n\nTools like these help candidates in future job applications and are helping\ncreate what Kerrison describes as a \u201ccandidate-driven marketplace\u201d.\n\n**The challenges ahead**\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that recruitment is one serious industry.\n\nKPMG valued the Australian recruitment industry [at $11.2 billion in\n2015-16](https://docs.jobs.gov.au/system/files/doc/other/the_australian_recruitment_industry_accessible_version_august_2016_final.pdf),\nwith almost 7,000 recruitment agencies in the local market.\n\nAnd technology looks set to become a key enabler for businesses looking to\ntake a piece of the lucrative recruitment pie.\n\nBut the relative lack of innovation in the space so far makes technologies\nlike Pymetrics groundbreaking.\n\nSo groundbreaking, in fact, that it becomes an obstacle.\n\n\u201cIf you look at HR, this is not a traditional technology buyer within an\norganisation,\u201d says Kerrison.\n\nUptake of Pymetrics has followed a traditional adoption curve so far, she\nsays.\n\n\u201cOur view is, if we can work with right companies who really can move the\nmarket, the flow will be amazing by the time the rest of the market is ready\nto embrace it.\u201d\n\n**Cold hard data**\n\nAs for one Australian company, it is the cold hard truth of data that is being\nused to move the recruitment market.\n\nIn what is a telling tale of just how immature the HR technology space is,\nfour-year-old [PredictiveHire](https://www.predictivehire.com/) was \u201cone of\nthe early players in the space\u201d, says company CEO Barb Hyman.\n\nLike Pymetrics, PredictiveHire utilises AI and machine learning technologies\nto deliver the best possible recruitment outcomes for its clients.\n\nBut the two companies are far from like-for-like.\n\nPredictiveHire is all about the power of data. It thrives off tangible results\nand like any machine learning algorithm, it gets better as it learns more.\n\n![](/content/dam/ia/article/images/PredictiveHireMediaRelease-\nNovember2018-7.jpg)\n\nPredictiveHire CEO Barb Hyman. Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like Netflix for recruiting,\u201d says Hyman.\n\nBut rather than sending applicants into a spiral of binge viewing, it gives\nthem a carefully crafted survey to fill out, designed to identify the traits\nthat best correlate with success in the respective role.\n\nPerformance data \u2013 think productivity metrics, sales metrics, turnover data,\nHRIS data, even rostering data \u2013 is fed into the PredictiveHire model and used\nto identify what success looks like.\n\n\u201cIt means that not every customer can use our product,\u201d Hyman openly says. \u201cIf\nyou don\u2019t have any way of measuring performance other than turnover and\nabsenteeism, it\u2019s very hard to get your ROI.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe product works particularly well with businesses in retail, sales and\ncontact centres because there\u2019s both productivity metrics and outcome metrics.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t ratings, because ratings are notoriously subjective. This is\nhardcore business measures.\u201d\n\nThe data is sent through to PredictiveHire on a monthly basis and is used to\nretrain the model. This also allows for an agile approach to what is deemed\nsuccess.\n\nAnd its data-driven model has drawn the attention of some of the biggest names\nin Australian HR and recruitment.\n\nThe company recently inked major deals with both Hudson Australia and PageUp,\nwhich help continue the implementation of predictive analytics in HR and the\nrecruitment process.\n\n**Empowering recruiters and candidates**\n\nOne of the most pertinent issues with the traditional recruitment model is\nthat the recruiter or HR manager is cut out of the process as soon as the hire\nis made.\n\nThis gives the recruiter very limited feedback as to whether or not the\nselected candidate was successful.\n\nPredictiveHire addresses this.\n\n\u201cHR doesn\u2019t often get the business data, they don\u2019t ever get to know how\nsuccessful this person was,\u201d Hyman says.\n\n\u201cIt makes recruiters feel less like process people and more like business\npeople.\u201d\n\nHyman has a background as a lawyer, but it was her time working in HR at the\nREA Group that ignited her passion for disrupting recruitment.\n\nAt the core of this is a desire to drive out the biases that have become far\ntoo common in recruitment.\n\n[A study at Yale University](https://news.yale.edu/2012/09/24/scientists-not-\nimmune-gender-bias-yale-study-shows) found that male and female scientists \u2013\nthose with an education underpinned by unwavering objectivity \u2013 were more\nlikely to hire men over women, even when the qualifications of the applicants\nwere identical.\n\n\u201cWhat you absolutely want to do is ensure you\u2019ve got a diverse group of people\nin the business, because what drives innovation is difference,\u201d Hyman says.\n\nAnd while initiatives such as unconscious bias training can help, at the end\nof the day it is just a \u2018tick the box\u2019 exercise, Hyman believes.\n\nIt is technology that can provide a meaningful tool when it comes to removing\nbias in recruitment.\n\n\u201cHow do you improve the fairness so that everyone has a chance? With data you\ncan really look at someone\u2019s true DNA,\u201d she continues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about saying that you can be successful in a sales role, not because\nyou\u2019ve done sales or because you\u2019ve got a degree in sales or you\u2019re white or\nmale, but because you\u2019ve got the qualities that are going to make for a\nsuccessful salesperson.\n\n\u201cYou cut through any biases around what great looks like, which is usually how\nwe all make our recruitment decisions.\u201d\n\n**More than technology**\n\nThe disruption of the recruitment market isn\u2019t limited to advances in\ntechnology.\n\nRather, it is the reinvention of the ideas associated with recruitment.\n\n[WithYouWithMe](https://withyouwithme.com/) (WYWM) was originally set up as a\nway to help ex-military personnel transition into the workforce.\n\nThe focus is on utilising some of the skills that became second nature through\ntheir training, and applying them to new contexts, particularly in high tech\nfields.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really focused on are high tech skills that are in demand in the\nlabour market,\u201d says company co-founder and COO Luke Rix.\n\n\u201cAreas like data analytics, cloud computing, automation, cyber security \u2013\nwe\u2019ve developed all of our own training in those courses to upskill to the\nmarket.\n\n\u201cAt the moment there\u2019s just a big lack of talent in each of those industries\nwhere veterans fill those gaps quite well.\u201d\n\n![](/content/dam/ia/article/images/WYWM_IG18_Headshot-132.jpg)\n\nWithYouWithMe co-founder and COO Luke Rix. Source: Supplied\n\nIt\u2019s a simple concept that has bred success.\n\nWYWM has placed more than 750 military in \u201cmeaningful new careers\u201d since it\nlaunched the program in 2016.\n\nThe company also climbed to second place in [last year\u2019s Deloitte Technology\nFast 50 Awards in the \u2018Rising Star\u2019\ncategory](https://ia.acs.org.au/article/2018/afterpay-takes-out-tech-\naward.html), recording an astronomical 3,427% annual growth.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Rix and the team to realise they could apply their\nprinciples to demographics beyond ex-military.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got programs that help professional athletes when they\u2019re transitioning\nout of sport into the corporate life,\u201d Rix says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got return-to-work parents programs and we\u2019ve also got programs which\nhelp students when they\u2019ve graduated from university, who might not actually\nbe job ready.\u201d\n\nAn internally developed testing solution identifies \u201cthe underlying potential\u201d\nin any given individual, highlighting just where they could fit in to the\nmodern workplace.\n\n\u201cThe testing gets to the root of your potential, whether that\u2019s your aptitude,\nyour psychometrics, your behavioural style,\u201d he explains.\n\n**Finding common ground**\n\nThe process of taking one set of skills and looking at how they can be applied\nin a new context allows WYWM to identify some patterns.\n\nRix gives the example of a cyber security professional.\n\n\u201cWhat we really target is what is it and what are the skills that make a good\ncyber security analyst or penetration tester,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cA lot of that comes down to the idea of an individual who is able to assess\nrisk, assess threat and actually apply intelligence to make decisions in\nenvironments that require fast decision making.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re invariably skills that individuals learn in the defence force.\u201d\n\n**Looking within**\n\nThroughout their journey, Rix and the WYWM team have learnt that sometimes the\nbest talent is already in the company \u2013 just in the wrong role.\n\n[Potential](https://potential.withyouwithme.com/) \u2013 launched just last week \u2013\nis WYWM\u2019s talent sourcing platform that helps companies reshape their existing\nworkforce to prepare for the future of work.\n\nUsing artificial technology, a company can test their entire workforce and use\nthe data to identify which workers are best suited to moving into the most in\ndemand roles.\n\nImportantly, the software also puts company culture into the equation when\nfinding potential suitors.\n\nThe program is about uncovering the \u201chidden talent\u201d that companies might\nalready have in their ranks, Rix says.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a program that could potentially save redundancies down the line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about hiring and firing, it\u2019s about placing individuals where the\ngreatest need is for the organisation.\u201d\n\nA world where recruitment is seamless and redundancies are redeployments?\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens.\n\n![](/content/dam/ia/article/images/Edward%20Pollitt%204.jpg)\n\nEdward Pollitt [![Twitter](/etc/designs/ia/clientlib-all/Images/twitter-\nicon.png)](https://twitter.com/edwardpollitt)\n\n**Edward Pollitt**  After starting as an intern for _Information Age_ in 2017,\nEdward became a full-time journalist with the publication.

Twelve myths about psychometric tests that you\u2019ve fallen for\n\n#  Twelve myths about psychometric tests that you\u2019ve fallen for\n\n**30 November 2017** \\- [****](/insights/news?author=)\n\n#### ![Test Results](/~/media/Images/Insights/TestResults.jpg)This is what you\nneed to know about testing personality and performance of your team\n\n**Guest blogger Adrian Furnham**\n\nThe enthusiasm for using personality tests in selection and development waxes\nand wanes. It is a big industry. There are defenders and distractors who\nperiodically \u201chave a go at each other\u201d on a number of repeated issues.\n\nHaving researched this area for 30 years, I\u2019ve come across common criticisms\nof staff testing. Here are some common misunderstandings.\n\n### MYTH ONE: All tests are biased particularly with regard to sex and race\n\nSome tests do show sex and race differences. These are well known: men score\nbetter on spatial visual tasks and women on verbal tasks; women score higher\non measures of empathy and social intelligence than men.\n\nThere are more differences on ability tests than personality tests usually.\nIndeed, the test manuals say so.\n\nJust because there may be some sex or race or age or culture differences does\nnot mean they are invalid but rather that they need to be used in a very\nparticular way checking against population norms. Any bias occurs in how they\nare used, not in what they measure. Many organisations like the Commission for\nRacial Equality have investigated and approved many tests.\n\n### MYTH TWO: All candidates fake responses, making answers worthless\n\nIf everyone faked a good/ideal answer, tests would have no validity. However,\nthere are a number of techniques that test constructors have for caching those\nwho give misleading answers. This includes looking at the answers of those\nwhom they have deliberately asked to lie, so that they know what to look out\nfor \u2013 such as socially desirable responses. Concerned? Tests of ability are\nlikely to be more valid.\n\n### MYTH THREE: Testing is too costly in terms of time and money\n\nDo your research: a surprising number of tests are free. Some tests can be too\nexpensive for what they provide, but the majority very good value. If the cost\nof testing is taken into consideration compared to a candidate\u2019s annual salary\nor the cost of poor performance of a new recruit, testing remains cost-\nefficient and beneficial.\n\nOf course, in-house staff can be trained to use and deliver tests, which over\nthe years can reduce outgoings.\n\n### MYTH FOUR: Mood, health and the setting influence test results\n\nIn fact, the opposite is true. Standardised tests are surprisingly robust.\nThey yield very similar results, on different occasions, a long time apart.\nThey are just as reliable as most medical tests and much more so than some\n(blood pressure measures).\n\nHowever, there is an exception: the circumstances that are likely to yield the\nmost unreliable results is where a person is doing an ability test while\nfeeling very unwell.\n\n### MYTH FIVE: Tests do no not predict work performance\n\nThis is perhaps the most important issue. Of course, some tests are not used\nfor selection: they may be used for team or personal development or coaching.\nGood tests have all the data in their manuals that dictate what they should be\nused for. It is the criteria by which tests should be selected in the\nworkplace.\n\n### MYTH SIX: Most tests can\u2019t measure important values such as integrity and\nmotivation\n\nIn fact, there are over 50,000 tests of psychological factors in print. In\nsome cases, consultants realise there is a demand for some sort of tests and\nthey are willing to supply it, even though they quite often are not prepared\nto put in the time and effort to establish their validity. Therefore, use\ntests that have been used elsewhere over time.\n\n### MYTH SEVEN: People change\n\nThe data shows the opposite. IQ measured at aged 12 correlates positively with\nIQ measured on the same test in those over 80. The same is true of personality\nin studies where we have longitudinal data. We know that people become a\nlittle less extraverted and neurotic as they get older, and a little more\nconscientious and agreeable but the changes are relatively mild. After the\nmid-twenties there is surprisingly little change in personality to the mid-\nseventies.\n\nSome people experience significant trauma that does change them but this is\nrelatively rare. This means that test scores remain valid for long periods.\n\n### MYTH EIGHT: Tests that measure the same thing are the same\n\nTests trying to measure the same thing, like intelligence or personality, can\nbe radically different. Many share an approach and for some traits or\nabilities look very much alike. Take for instance introversion-extraversion:\nmany tests seem identical, but this trait can also be measured by weighing a\nperson\u2019s salivation after lemon is put on the tongue! The question is not what\nthe test looks like but rather evidence of their validity or reliability.\n\n### MYTH NINE: Ignore results, you can teach anybody to be a great performer\n\nThe idea that anyone can become a brain surgeon or an airplane pilot with\nenough practice and training is still very popular. It is called the \u20181,000\nrule\u2019 and has been applied to athletes.\n\nEven the most radical of those that dismiss innate talent are forced to agree\nthat you need a set of certain characteristics to succeed at certain jobs. In\nother words, you simply cannot teach just anyone to be good at serious\ntechnical and managerial jobs however hard they try.\n\n### MYTH TEN: Tests don\u2019t spot \u201cproblem people\u201d well enough\n\nThere are numerous clinical tests that set out to do just this. However, the\ndata suggest that many personal staffing issues are the result of the way an\nemployee is managed.\n\nThis is not to suggest that selectors should not look for evidence of\npathology and dark side traits, but rather that they should not always blame\nthe individual or the selector if people become problematic.\n\n### MYTH ELEVEN: Attitude, knowledge and skill are more important than\nintelligence and personality at work\n\nIf by attitude you mean motivation then this is partly true. No matter how\nbright an individual or how suited they are to a job if they are not\nsufficiently intrinsically motivated very little can be done.\n\nKnowledge and skill can be taught, but this is affected by personality and\nintelligence. Brighter people learn faster. Some studies show that certain\npersonality types pick up skills faster than others.\n\n### MYTH TWELVE: The \u201cold trio\u201d (application form, interviews and references)\nwork well enough in a selection process\n\nAgain, this is partly true if: the application form collects biodata that is\nimportant and relevant to the job; the interview is planned and structured;\nthe references are collected from people who know the candidate and are\nprepared to tell the truth. This, however, is rarely done and the old trio is\nwoefully inadequate.\n\nThe accurate and reliable assessment of people at work is essential for many\ndecisions around selection, development, promotion and redundancy. It is a\ncomplex area but one clearly related to the health and success of any\norganisation.\n\nTesting and assessment is a specialised field and may require an expert to\nensure the test is used appropriately and effectively. There remains a lot of\nignorance and myths about assessment methods that can have significant\nproblems for HR managers in particular organisations.\n\n  \n\nPowered by Professional Manager\n\n##  Recommended\n\n[\u203a How to run a great mentoring session](/insights/news/2019/may/how-to-run-a-\ngreat-mentoring-session \"How to run a great mentoring session\")\n\n[\u203a How to create a mentoring programme that\nlasts](/insights/news/2019/december/how-to-create-a-mentoring-programme-that-\nlasts \"How to create a mentoring programme that lasts\")\n\n[\u203a How to eradicate unconscious bias at work](/insights/news/2019/july/how-to-\neradicate-unconscious-bias-at-work \"How to eradicate unconscious bias at\nwork\")\n\n[\u203a How to get started as a mentor](/insights/news/2019/december/how-to-get-\nstarted-as-a-mentor \"How to get started as a mentor\")\n\n[![Management Direct - Login here](/~/media/Images/Image Linkboxes/md-\nvalue.png?h=400&w=280)](https://auth.md.cmi.org.uk/interop.aspx \"md-value\")\n\n[![Our latest research](/~/media/Images/Menu and Block Images/our-latest-\nresearch.png?h=167&w=331)](/insights \"Read Our Latest Research\")\n\n##  [Read Our Latest Research](/insights \"Read Our Latest Research\")\n\n[![Press and Media Enquiries](/~/media/Images/Blocks/press-media-enquiries-\nnoborder.png?h=167&w=331)](/about-us/media-centre \"Press & Media Enquiries\")\n\n##  [Press & Media Enquiries](/about-us/media-centre \"Press & Media\nEnquiries\")\n\nFor more information or to request interviews, contact CMI's Press Team on 020\n7421 2705 or email\n[press.office@managers.org.uk](mailto:press.office@managers.org.uk?subject=Press%20and%20Media%20Enquiries)\n\n##  Most Popular\n\n[\u203a The 5 Greatest Examples of Change Management in Business\nHistory](/insights/news/2015/july/the-5-greatest-examples-of-change-\nmanagement-in-business-history \"The 5 Greatest Examples of Change Management\nin Business History\")\n\n[\u203a Four companies that failed spectacularly, and the lessons of their\npremature demise](/insights/news/2015/september/four-companies-that-failed-\nspectacularly-and-the-lessons-of-their-premature-demise \"Four companies that\nfailed spectacularly, and the lessons of their premature demise\")\n\n[\u203a 6 companies that get employee engagement \u2013 and what they do\nright](/insights/news/2015/december/six-companies-that-get-employee-\nengagement-and-what-they-do-right \"6 companies that get employee engagement \u2013\nand what they do right\")\n\n[\u203a 4 Signs That Racism May Be An Issue In Your\nWorkplace](/insights/news/2016/may/4-signs-that-racism-may-be-an-issue-in-\nyour-workplace \"4 Signs That Racism May Be An Issue In Your Workplace\")\n\n[\u203a Current research](/insights/research/current-research \"Current research\")\n\n##  Benefits of Membership\n\n###  Gain professional recognition\n\nGain recognition for enhancing your knowledge, understanding and practice of\nmanagement.

What does a final\ninterview mean? It means you have passed through other interviews to reach\nhere. You have tried to work hard because it is not very easy to get to this\nfar. There is a very high probability of you being fit for the job. There is\nalso a very high chance of stiff competition; therefore, serious preparation\nis needed. Final round interview questions are very tough consequently proper\npreparation is critical. However, it might be challenging to know what to\nexpect, do not be afraid to ask. Some companies would like to help you. Do not\nbe hesitant of who will be facilitating the interview, but remember that you\nare not the only one. There are other candidates.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/interview-queue.jpg)\n\n[](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1311518/pexels-\nphoto-1311518.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500)\n\n#### Final interview\n\nYou can maybe in a position where you are asking what final interview means.\nThis is the stage where you are on the shortlist of the candidates who passed\nthe previous interviews. Reaching the final interview requires that you\nprepare thoroughly. Preparing for an interview might be not very easy however,\nsome steps have to be taken for one to develop a checklist of the things to do\nbefore the interview.\n\n  * Examine the job description and know what that job is about.\n  * Research on the company in question. Know what they exactly need\n  * Consider your qualifications  \n  * Consider the answers you\u2019ll be giving \n  * Practice your voice and body language well\n  * Get copies of your resume \n  * Consider your dress code\n  * Get your travel arrangements ready\n  * Be ready to sell yourself to the interviewers\n\nWhen you follow the above steps, there is a very high chance of qualifying for\nthe second interview. Also, have in mind the questions to ask the interviewer.\n[Online resume service ResumeThatWorks](https://resumethatworks.com/) will\nhelp you to get some of the perfect questions and getting a perfect resume for\nyour awaited job.\n\n Resume writing is a must .A perfect resume is one of the significant things\nthat will determine whether you qualify for a job or not. When writing a\nresume you can always tailor it to fit the job description. You need to get\nthe right resume format. Highlight all the necessary details like your\neducation, relevant experience and your contacts. Don\u2019t forget your relevant\nskills fit for the job in question. You can get your resume from the\nprofessional online writers. Don\u2019t forget to make a hard copy of your resume\non your way to the final interview.\n\n#### Get to know what you are getting yourself into\n\nBecause it\u2019s important to understand what you are getting yourself into for\nthe final round interview, preparation is vital. However, there is no formula\nto follow as you prepare. On the other hand, the employer may use the cultural\nfit interview for them to know the potential candidate fit for the job, where\nelse the rest of the team may keep the most challenging question. Don\u2019t assume\nthat you have made it in the final interview because you still need to sell\nthe best version of you without being arrogant. Do not be overly comfortable\nor reluctant. Instead, treat the interview with a high form of seriousness and\nprofessionalism as you did previously in the recent interviews. Also, don\u2019t\ndownsize the interviewers with your acquired achievements in your former\nworkstations or acquired education because final interview questions are\nalways tricky.\n\n#### Be a professional; you are not the only one\n\nAs you prepare for your final job interview keep in mind that interviewers\nmight test you on the emotional part so you should be well-composed and\nconfident avoid giving too much information on your personal life once asked.\nMaintain professionalism because this is a competition involving many\nqualified individuals. It\u2019s crucial to maintain your composure during the\ninterview, this will help you to answer your questions with confidence, and\nthis will mean you will have to use smooth voice to table your experience\nconvincingly. Nevertheless the final round interview questions requires\nbalance, which includes your strengths and weaknesses, personality and\nprofessionalism. Therefore striking a balance will rely on how prepared you\nare. Therefore you need to thoroughly prepare for final interview. You can get\nthis information on preparation from [Essayzoo](https://essayzoo.org/).\n\n#### This is the last chance you have for correcting your mistakes\n\nBesides, use this as the last chance to correct any mistakes made in the\nprevious interviews and present yourself to be the best candidate for the\nposition. In case you forgot some details in the previous interviews, this is\nthe high time to mention them to improve the chances of you securing the\nposition. Identify all the possible failures of the previous interviews and\nfocus on improving them, this will only be achieved through thorough\npreparation. For example if you had written a wrong resume you can get a\nperfect resume from a [paper writing service\n](https://essaywritingservice.ca/) Most companies will focus on pointing to\nyour weaknesses, therefore, work on covering them up during preparations. Know\nthe right questions to ask. Get to know how to reposition your weaknesses and\nstrengthen them. Also show the interviewer your strengths and that you are\nwilling to work on your weaknesses to fit in the position and better the\ncompany to achieve its objectives. Check on your behaviour in terms of speech\nand how you conduct yourself during the interview. Avoid negative energy, and\ndon\u2019t be passive because that will raise a red flag to the interviewers.\n\n[](https://images.pexels.com/photos/416405/pexels-\nphoto-416405.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=1&w=500)\n\n####  Get ready for the test\n\nTake time to prepare by carefully reviewing the job description and also doing\nresearch on the company in question. The following steps will help you get\nready;\n\n  * Thoroughly check the job description and align yourself with the required details.\n  * Have a clear picture of why you need the job\n  * Research the company in terms of its products, services and company culture.\n  * Go through the common interview questions and the best way to answer them.\n  * Spend time practicing your best speaking voice and body language to use while answering questions.\n  * Come up with some thoughtful questions for the interviewers; this makes many employers feel confident about you.\n  * Print several hard copies of your resumes which will make the interviewers have access to it during the interview\n  * On the D-day leave early and make sure you arrive at the interview place in time with all documents required of you set.\n  * Be prepared to follow up after the interview, this will show that you genuinely need the job \n\nConclusively, the final interview is the last interview with the HR manager;\ntherefore this is the high time to be the best version of you.  The manager\nhas clearly prepared good interview questions to ask you. There are very\ncrucial questions you have to ask yourself and get answers before the\ninterview. Questions like, why do you need the job and how well you prepared\nfor the job are questions that need to be well dealt with. Remember to be\nthorough prepared before entering the interview room.

No one will\n> want to repeat that.\u201d\n\n> \u201cThis case should act as a wake-up call for employers: now is the time to go\n> through restrictive covenants to make sure that your covenants are\n> enforceable. Fixing issues before an employee leaves might cost a few\n> hundred pounds; fixing them afterwards might cost tens of thousands or be\n> entirely impossible.\u201d\n\n**The case** relates to whether a post-termination non-competition covenant in\na contract that prevents an ex-employee from being \u201cinterested in\u201d (i.e.\nowning any shares in) a competitor for six months is too wide and therefore\nunenforceable.\n\nThere were fears that if deemed too wide, many similarly drafted non-\ncompetition covenants in employment contracts would be unenforceable.  The\nSupreme Court has said the offending restriction could be deleted from the\ncovenant, leaving an enforceable, valid non-competition clause.\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Femployers-\ndodge-a-bullet-as-supreme-court-rules-in-favour-of-upholding-restrictive-\ncovenant%2F&linkname=Employers%20dodge%20a%20bullet%20as%20Supreme%20Court%20rules%20in%20favour%20of%20upholding%20restrictive%20covenant\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Femployers-\ndodge-a-bullet-as-supreme-court-rules-in-favour-of-upholding-restrictive-\ncovenant%2F&linkname=Employers%20dodge%20a%20bullet%20as%20Supreme%20Court%20rules%20in%20favour%20of%20upholding%20restrictive%20covenant\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Femployers-\ndodge-a-bullet-as-supreme-court-rules-in-favour-of-upholding-restrictive-\ncovenant%2F&linkname=Employers%20dodge%20a%20bullet%20as%20Supreme%20Court%20rules%20in%20favour%20of%20upholding%20restrictive%20covenant\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Femployers-\ndodge-a-bullet-as-supreme-court-rules-in-favour-of-upholding-restrictive-\ncovenant%2F&linkname=Employers%20dodge%20a%20bullet%20as%20Supreme%20Court%20rules%20in%20favour%20of%20upholding%20restrictive%20covenant\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Femployers-\ndodge-a-bullet-as-supreme-court-rules-in-favour-of-upholding-restrictive-\ncovenant%2F&linkname=Employers%20dodge%20a%20bullet%20as%20Supreme%20Court%20rules%20in%20favour%20of%20upholding%20restrictive%20covenant\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/employers-dodge-a-bullet-as-supreme-court-rules-in-favour-of-upholding-restrictive-covenant/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/employers-dodge-a-bullet-as-supreme-court-rules-in-favour-of-upholding-restrictive-covenant/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/law-150x150.png&p\\[title\\]=Employers dodge a bullet as Supreme Court rules in favour of upholding restrictive covenant)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/employers-dodge-a-bullet-as-supreme-court-rules-in-favour-of-upholding-restrictive-covenant/&text=Employers dodge a bullet as Supreme Court rules in favour of upholding restrictive covenant)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

It was only added to the ICD-11\nthis year despite being recognised in the 1970s.\n\nBurnout is not a rare occurrence, in the UK alone over half a million people\nsuffered from workplace stress in 2018 \u2013 12.8 million working days were lost\ndue to this condition in 2018/19.\n\n**Staff at risk**\n\nBurnout can be prevented and resolved if noticed in time. The first thing to\ndo is to check workloads. If staff are working through their breaks, taking\nwork home or doing overtime, this is a sign their workload may be too much and\nthis could be a trigger of burnout.\n\nIf one employee is taking on too many responsibilities, this could also put\nthem at risk of burnout. This a particular likelihood to people who have\ncertain traits and habits: those who are high achievers and have\nperfectionistic tendencies; people who like to be in control and are reluctant\nto delegate work to others; and those who feel nothing is ever good enough.\n\n**Spot the signs**\n\nLike any illness, burnout has symptoms which occur over time, but they vary\nfrom person to person. Don\u2019t assume that it can only affect managers and\ndirectors; burnout can happen to anyone in any position.\n\nIf you notice staff efficiency and energy has reduced, that could be a warning\nsign that burnout may occur. If deadlines are being regularly missed by a\nmember of staff who is usually considered hardworking and reliable, it could\nbe because they are overworked and unhappy.\n\nCynicism and negativity from a characteristically positive person is another\ncommon sign that they are probably feeling the effects of burnout.\n\nThe WHO says that burnout is characterised by three dimensions:\n\n\u00b7     A sense of exhaustion or depletion\n\n\u00b7     Mental distance from or negativity or cynicism about work\n\n\u00b7     Decreased effectiveness at work\n\n**How to combat it**\n\nPrevention is the first port of call and the most effective way of combating\nburnout. This can be done by encouraging a positive work-life balance and\nprioritising a mental health at work.\n\nIt\u2019s all about balance. Everyone has a job to do, but it\u2019s vital to ensure\nthat work doesn\u2019t fall on the head of one person. Share responsibility\nencourage team lunches and set a cut off time which employees can\u2019t work\nbeyond are just some of the ways in which an employer can try to prevent\nburnout.  \n\nWhile burnout won\u2019t go away on its own, it isn\u2019t incurable.

With the statutory number of\nholidays being 28 days \u2013 including bank holidays \u2013 workers are hoping for more\ntime off to relax and have a break from their every-day lives.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/holiday.jpg)\n\nThe study which was conducted by Danish ferry company DFDS investigated the\neffect that work and everyday stresses can have on the British publics\u2019 mental\nstate and how to improve this. The study found that over three quarters (76%)\nof females and 73 per cent of males all wished they could take time off work\nto have a break and experience the world.\n\n25-34-year olds were the most likely to wish for more time off with nine in\nten (90%) stating they wish for more time off work.\n\nWhen asked what their motivations for booking a holiday was 42 per cent of the\nUK cited work and life stresses as their main motivation.\n\nFemales were the most likely to book a holiday due to work and life stresses\nwith almost half (43%) when related to 14 per cent of males.\n\nThe age group who are motivated by everyday stresses to book are holiday the\nmost are the 16-24-year old with over half (54%) stating this as their reason\nto book a holiday. However, 55+ year olds were the least likely to book a\nholiday due to work related stress with less than one in ten (7%) booking for\nthis reason.\n\nThe survey also discovered that three quarters (74%) of Brits experience\nstress on a day-to-day basis. Almost four in five (77%) of females experienced\nday-to-day stress making them the most likely to experience work and life\nstress when related to 71 per cent of males.\n\nWith 25-34-year olds wishing they could take more time off work, they were\nalso the age group that experienced stresses of work and life the most with 86\nper cent stating this.\n\n25-34-year olds were additionally the most likely to book a holiday to benefit\ntheir wellbeing with over two thirds (70), followed by 63 per cent of\n16-24-year olds.\n\nOver half of females (51%) have booked a holiday for this reason, closely\nfollowed by 50 per cent of males.\n\nBelfast was the most likely city in the UK to book a holiday for their\nwellbeing with 64 per cent of residents citing this reason.\n\nDue to work and life stress and wellbeing being the main motivations for\nbooking holidays, holiday makers hope to come back home with their stress\nrelieved. The study revealed that 79 per cent of Brits returned from holiday\nfeeling significantly less stressed.\n\nFemales felt the benefit of a holiday on their mental health the most with\nover four in five (82%) stating their stress had disappeared after their\nholiday, compared to 74 per cent of males.\n\n25-34 and 35-44-year olds had the biggest stress release on holiday with 86\nper cent and 82 per cent returning less stressed respectively. 55+ year olds\nwere the least likely to feel less stressed after their holiday 70 per cent\nreturning less stressed.\n\nEven though females are the ones who feel the benefit of a holiday on their\nwellbeing the most, they are also the least likely to book a holiday with a\nthird (30%) not booking a holiday in the previous 12 months, and a further 30\nper cent only booking one holiday \u2013 compared to only a quarter (27%) of males\nwho hadn\u2019t book a holiday with a year.\n\nDespite being the age group who wishes for more time off the most, 25-34-year\nolds book the most holidays with an average of two holidays a year and only 20\nper cent not booking a holiday in the previous 12 months.\n\nRuth Nightingale, a Gestalt Psychotherapist commentated on the findings of the\nstudy, \u201cThe anticipation of having a break and creating some distance from\ndaily demands can alleviate stress.\n\n\u201cIn our society, between the ages of 16 and 34 are the times when we are\nholding the most expectations of ourselves and others. As we grow older our\nneeds and activities change and we are more able to stand back from the\npressure that the younger adults feel.\u201d\n\nNightingale explained why holidays can increase wellbeing, \u201cWe are simply\nremoving ourselves from the daily demands of work and/or routine. Most of us\nhave rules or introjects that we live by, often identified by \u2018I should\u2026\u2019, or\n\u2018I shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u2019, or \u2018I ought to\u2026\u2019, that can be relaxed when we are away from\nour work, social and familial responsibilities.

According to CV-Library, HR professionals are saying today\u2019s\njob market is 90% candidate-driven, which means that as an employer, you don\u2019t\nchoose talent \u2013 talent chooses you.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/training-5.jpg)\n\nTaking in account LinkedIn\u2019s top hiring trends of the year, Lucinda Pullinger,\nGlobal Head of HR and Talent at Instant Offices provides tips on what\nemployers should look out for when hiring talented employees for the upcoming\nyear and beyond:\n\nEarlier this year, LinkedIn released the 2019 Global Talent Trends report,\nwhich surveyed  **5,000 talent professionals in 35 countries**. Combining the\nfour trends considered to be most important to the future of hiring and HR,\nhere\u2019s what to do:\n\n  1. **Invest in Employees Who Gel with Your Company Culture**\n\n**  91% Soft skills: **92% of those surveyed said that soft skills in the\nworkplace matter \u201cas much or more than\u201d hard skills. These include the ability\nto communicate, teamwork and problem solving, 80% say soft skills are critical\nto company success, as soft skills are more future-proofed than technical\nskills, which advance rapidly.\n\n  * **Offer Prospective Employees the Perks that Matter to Them**\n\n**72% Work Flexibility:  **Employers who offer flexibility in the interview\nprocess may be off to a good start. Once considered a perk, flexible hours are\nfast becoming a standard expectation among job seekers. LinkedIn has seen a\n78% increase in job posts mentioning flexibility in the past two years. This\ntrend in talent acquisition includes flexible working hours as well as the\nability to work remotely from coworking spaces or hot desks.\n\n  * **Build a Healthy and Happy Company Culture**\n\n**71% Safety and happiness:**  Job seekers are looking for places where\nwellbeing, communication and diversity are valued. There has been a 71% year-\non-year increase in the amount of workplace harassment content shared on\nLinkedIn, and candidates are increasingly seeking out workplaces with policies\nin place to prevent and combat harassment and actively protect their rights.\n\n  * **Encourage Transparency and Communication**\n\n**53% Pay Transparency:**  Pay has always been a confidential topic, but more\ncandidates are looking for transparency around remuneration. More employers\nare starting to proactively share salary information. 27% of those surveyed\nsay they share ranges with employees and candidates early on in the hiring\nprocess, and another 22% say they\u2019re likely to start doing this in the next\nfive years.\n\nThese trends are shaping the workplace of the future into a more agile,\nflexible and inclusive one. The Millennial workforce is placing a consistently\nstrong focus on better flexibility and remote work options, as well as\ndiversity, inclusion, wellbeing and more progressive values.\n\nConsidering that the global workforce will be dominated by Millennials by 2020\n(at a predicted 35%), companies need to begin shifting mindsets for their\ntalent acquisition strategies to be effective.\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Ftop-\ntalent-acquisition-trends-in-2019-and-\nbeyond%2F&linkname=Top%20Talent%20Acquisition%20Trends%20in%202019%20and%20Beyond\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Ftop-\ntalent-acquisition-trends-in-2019-and-\nbeyond%2F&linkname=Top%20Talent%20Acquisition%20Trends%20in%202019%20and%20Beyond\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Ftop-\ntalent-acquisition-trends-in-2019-and-\nbeyond%2F&linkname=Top%20Talent%20Acquisition%20Trends%20in%202019%20and%20Beyond\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Ftop-\ntalent-acquisition-trends-in-2019-and-\nbeyond%2F&linkname=Top%20Talent%20Acquisition%20Trends%20in%202019%20and%20Beyond\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Ftop-\ntalent-acquisition-trends-in-2019-and-\nbeyond%2F&linkname=Top%20Talent%20Acquisition%20Trends%20in%202019%20and%20Beyond\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/top-talent-acquisition-trends-in-2019-and-beyond/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/top-talent-acquisition-trends-in-2019-and-beyond/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/training-5-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=Top Talent Acquisition Trends in 2019 and Beyond)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/top-talent-acquisition-trends-in-2019-and-beyond/&text=Top Talent Acquisition Trends in 2019 and Beyond)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

However, technology is also powering the\nbeginning of modernisation in terms of employee management, with many\ncompanies starting to use software applications and new, often futuristic,\ntechnologies in order to establish easier methods with which to manage HR\nresources.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ipad.jpg)\n\n**iTrent Software Applications**\n\niTrent is a web-based management application that is rapidly changing the way\nthat employee managers can delegate and perform tasks, performing a number of\nfunctions that are core to the running of any HR department. iTrent software\nsolutions allow managers to better control applicant tracking and sourcing\nprocedures, allows you to plan a workforce and payrolls simply and easily, and\ncan even manage performance tracking, learning and development processes. This\nall-in-one application gives you the ability to live track performance, and\nthe workforce, in order to create workable strategies to improve your employee\nmanagement. However, any new technologies used in businesses can be difficult\nto master, and if you are struggling to make the most from your investment,\nyou should [learn about\niTrent](https://www.phase3consulting.co.uk/consulting/itrent/) through hiring\na consultant company to ensure that the software is established with your\nbusiness processes.\n\n**Artificial Intelligence**\n\nArtificial intelligence is also modernising the way that employees are\nmanaged. Rather than being a threat to employees, as it was first perceived,\nartificial intelligence now enables human resources to be delegated to where\nthey are most needed by focusing on time-consuming and unskilled tasks\nintegral to the business. However, as well as filling skills gaps that your\ncompany may be facing, artificial intelligence can also aid the strength of\nyour workforce through working through CVs and finding those most compatible\nwith job descriptions, eradicating any bias or human error in terms of job\napplicants. This can then enable managers to get a skilled team around them\nthat reflects the modern world and whose talents can be used to drive\nimprovement in the business.\n\n**Mobile Learning**\n\nNot only this, but the way that employees are trained and are constantly\ndeveloping can also be modernised in companies through the benefits of mobile\nlearning. Mobile learning can help employees to receive personalised training\nprograms that they can complete from any location, and whose information can\nthen be accurately returned to the employee manager. This can then reduce the\ncosts of travel, the hiring of an instructor, and the time that training\nusually takes, with employees being able to complete training at a flexible\nrate when they feel most motivated to do so.\n\n**The Cloud**\n\nTechnology can also help to modernise the way that employers handle employees,\nwith applications such as cloud solutions meaning that employees can work\nremotely from any location that they desire. Rather than work in an office,\nemployees can simple receive and upload work through file-sharing applications\non the cloud, meaning that work can be accessed by multiple parties at any one\ntime. This can then help to improve employee motivation and engagement.\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F4-ways-\ntechnology-can-modernise-employee-\nmanagement%2F&linkname=4%20Ways%20Technology%20Can%20Modernise%20Employee%20Management\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F4-ways-\ntechnology-can-modernise-employee-\nmanagement%2F&linkname=4%20Ways%20Technology%20Can%20Modernise%20Employee%20Management\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F4-ways-\ntechnology-can-modernise-employee-\nmanagement%2F&linkname=4%20Ways%20Technology%20Can%20Modernise%20Employee%20Management\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F4-ways-\ntechnology-can-modernise-employee-\nmanagement%2F&linkname=4%20Ways%20Technology%20Can%20Modernise%20Employee%20Management\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F4-ways-\ntechnology-can-modernise-employee-\nmanagement%2F&linkname=4%20Ways%20Technology%20Can%20Modernise%20Employee%20Management\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/4-ways-technology-can-modernise-employee-management/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/4-ways-technology-can-modernise-employee-management/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ipad-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=4 Ways Technology Can Modernise Employee Management)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/4-ways-technology-can-modernise-employee-management/&text=4 Ways Technology Can Modernise Employee Management)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

There are major implications\naround security and privacy that both employers and employees need to be aware\nof. What are they, and how can they be overcome?  \n  \nGDPR compliance  \n  \nOne of the biggest issues with using popular messaging apps for business\ncommunication is whether they are compliant with the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR). Having come into effect in May 2018, this law not only aims\nto protect the data and privacy of people living in the UK, EU and European\nEconomic Area but also data that is transferred to countries outside these\nareas.  \n  \nA lot of people aren\u2019t aware of the risks of using social media applications\nfor communication within a business. Whether it\u2019s just engaging in\nconversations with colleagues or sharing work documents via these apps, the\nway employers and staff communicate here can actually violate GDPR rules\nbecause they don\u2019t have control of where their data goes.  \n  \nUsing WhatsApp as an example, it offers users encryption. However, all\nconversations and documents are still stored in one of Facebook\u2019s datacentres.\nWhat if one of these datacentres were to be breached? Under GDPR, liability\nfalls onto the business whose data has been leaked. And while WhatsApp\nprovides end-to-end encryption, this doesn\u2019t cover backups or chat exports by\ndefault.  \n  \nThere are other important questions that businesses and employees should ask\nthemselves if they\u2019re using one of these apps. For instance, what if an\nemployee leaves a company but still has access to a Whatsapp chat or group? Or\nwhat happens when a business shares employee phone numbers without their\npermission?\n\n  \nHaving worked with a number of organisations across a range of industries,\nwe\u2019ve learnt that this is a major issue for employers. One company, which\nmanages staff across 50 UK-wide leisure facilities, ran into a number of\nproblems when groups were being created for different departments. In many\ninstances, people who had left the company could still access these groups.\nThey could do whatever they wanted with messages, files and personal phone\nnumbers.  \n  \nSharing personal details such as the phone numbers of workers without\npermission, because they\u2019re just added into groups by employers, can be\nanother big problem. People don\u2019t have the right to be forgotten as they can\u2019t\ncontrol or edit where this data sits. It\u2019s stored in a third-party, and\nthere\u2019s no way you can revoke access. WhatsApp warns:  \n\u201cPlease remember that when you delete your account, it does not affect the\ninformation other users have relating to you, such as their copy of the\nmessages you sent them.\"  \n  \nWhatsApp also accesses all the phone numbers in a user\u2019s address book, which\npresents a serious privacy issue. The firm states in its user terms: \"You\nprovide us, all in accordance with applicable laws, the phone numbers of\nWhatsApp users and your other contacts in your mobile address book on a\nregular basis, including for both the users of our Services and your other\ncontacts.\"  \n  \nHow to regain control  \n  \nI\u2019d say 80% of the people we've spoken to don\u2019t understand that using these\napps poses a huge risk to their business. Unless employers wake up to the\nthreats here, they risk the repercussions of hefty GDPR fines and lost\nconfidence from staff. If you run a business, you\u2019re probably wondering how\nyou can regain control and ultimately ensure compliance with GDPR. Here are\nsome tips.  \n  \n1.To start the journey towards GDPR compliance, understanding how this\nlegislation works and affects your business is important. Whether it\u2019s human\nresources, customer services, marketing or IT, most areas of your business\nhandle data on a daily basis and therefore must be GDPR compliant. There are\nboth legal and technical aspects to consider, which are detailed on the ISO\nwebsite.  \n  \n2\\. In particular, you should learn and understand the seven data protection\nprinciples as set out by GDPR:\n\n  * **Lawfulness, fairness and transparency - you should use data lawfully and be transparent with people. **\n  * **Purpose limitation - you must be clear about why and how your business collects personal data. **\n  * **Data minimisation - your business should only collect data if it actually intends on using it for a specific purpose. Less is better. **\n  * **Accuracy - you need to ensure that the data your business processes is accurate and stored in an appropriate manner. **\n  * **Storage limitation - you shouldn\u2019t keep data forever and set a period when it'll be deleted. **\n  * **Integrity and confidentiality - you must store data securely to prevent \u201caccidental loss, destruction or damage\u201d. **\n  * **Accountability - you need to establish, record and communicate data protection policies. This is paramount to proving compliance. **\n\n  \n3\\. You need to understand that using non-compliant messaging apps can be\ndangerous. Ask yourself: Are you using a manner to disperse company\ninformation you don\u2019t have control of?  \n  \nSystems audits will help you identify any applications that could potentially\nviolate GDPR. You need to find which communication channels (Whatsapp,\nFacebook Messenger, text message groups and more) are being used both\ninternally and externally. If you discover something that could be non-GDPR\ncompliant, you must find a safer alternative.  \n  \n4\\. Whether it\u2019s writing blogs or holding company-wide workshops, making your\nworkforce aware of issues around GDPR and the implications if their data got\ninto the wrong hands is important too . People understandably want to have\ninformation delivered to them easily and conveniently, but they also want this\nto be done in a manner that protects their data and privacy.  \n  \n5\\. Over time, things change. So once you\u2019ve implemented and established data\nprotection policies, you\u2019ll need to conduct regular audits. Policies could\nbecome outdated and your business will put itself at risk of data breaches\nwithout these.  \n  \nRegardless of the industry you operate in, as a business, getting things right\nwhen it comes to security and privacy is crucial. GDPR came into force to\nprotect people, and any employer has a duty to protect their staff.  \n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nmessaging-apps-are-creating-a-gdpr-privacy-\nnightmare%2F&linkname=How%20messaging%20apps%20are%20creating%20a%20GDPR%20privacy%20nightmare\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nmessaging-apps-are-creating-a-gdpr-privacy-\nnightmare%2F&linkname=How%20messaging%20apps%20are%20creating%20a%20GDPR%20privacy%20nightmare\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nmessaging-apps-are-creating-a-gdpr-privacy-\nnightmare%2F&linkname=How%20messaging%20apps%20are%20creating%20a%20GDPR%20privacy%20nightmare\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nmessaging-apps-are-creating-a-gdpr-privacy-\nnightmare%2F&linkname=How%20messaging%20apps%20are%20creating%20a%20GDPR%20privacy%20nightmare\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nmessaging-apps-are-creating-a-gdpr-privacy-\nnightmare%2F&linkname=How%20messaging%20apps%20are%20creating%20a%20GDPR%20privacy%20nightmare\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-messaging-apps-are-creating-a-gdpr-privacy-nightmare/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-messaging-apps-are-creating-a-gdpr-privacy-nightmare/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/whatsapp-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=How messaging apps are creating a GDPR privacy nightmare)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-messaging-apps-are-creating-a-gdpr-privacy-nightmare/&text=How messaging apps are creating a GDPR privacy nightmare)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

Maybe you\u2019ve\nbeen in the position a while now but want to be sure that you\u2019re doing all you\ncan to be as effective as possible. HR managers play a pivotal role in medium\nto large-sized companies that rely on that point person to basically oversee,\ntrain, hire, deal with conflict, and direct staff. Without that link between\nstaff and employers, things can fall apart rather quickly and not operate as\nthey should.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/happy-meetign-2.png)\n\nSo, how can you ensure that you\u2019re not just the typical HR manager, rather you\nare doing all you can to ensure the company operates smoothly from a staffing\nstandpoint. How can you in fact better your skills and effectiveness in your\nrole? Here are some tips that can prove to be helpful.\n\n## Work on Your Organisation Skills\n\nSure, this doesn't sound glamourous or fun, but it's amazing just how\nimportant organisation is for an HR manager. Did you know that if you're not\nproperly organised, you're not going to be able to perform at your peak level\nof effectiveness? As an HR manager, you need to be able to access documents,\nmaterials, and information whenever needed and ensure that you have an\norganised filing/storage system. By staying organised, you\u2019ll be able to use\nyour time more effectively, which will also prove to be important in your role\nas HR manager.\n\n## Communication Skills Must Be Top-Notch\n\nAs an HR manager, there are all kinds of skills you\u2019ll need to possess, but\nfew are as important as your communication skills. Much of your job will\ninvolve communication, whether that is speaking to others or listening to\nthem, so this skill needs to be well-developed. Even if you feel confident in\nyour current level of communication skills, it doesn't hurt to push yourself\nfurther and ensure you're doing all you can.\n\nSome tips you can use include:\n\n  * listening actively, which means you really hear what the person is saying and let it sink in\n  * learn to be direct and up-front with your messaging\n  * use positive body language (meaning eye contact and facial expressions)\n  * start repeating back what a person is saying to you\n  * give the person your full attention and don't multi-task\n  * keep things positive and professional at all times.\n\n## Enrol Yourself on Business Coaching Courses\n\nWhile the bulk of your job will be to know all the HR policies and procedures,\nin order to truly be effective in your role, it helps to branch out where your\nknowledge and skills are concerned. Business coaching is something that can\nprovide you with effective takeaways that help to give you confidence and\nknowledge. Business coaching courses are available through companies like [The\nBCF Group](https://www.thebcfgroup.co.uk/) and are meant to give you the\nskills you need to coach others.\n\nWhen you think of an HR representative, there is often a fair amount of\ntraining, teaching, and thereby coaching that takes place. You are the one\nthat is guiding new staff, coaching them and teaching them along the way, so\nwhy not get your own business coaching qualifications and really beef up your\nportfolio?\n\nDepending on how far you take your courses, you may be able to work your way\ninto a professional coaching role yourself. This can take you pretty far in\nthe field, not just in your current job, but in future opportunities.\n\n## Conflict Management and Problem Solving will Be a Big Part of the Job\n\nAs an HR manager, you have also signed on to be \"the person\" where conflict\nmanagement and problem solving is concerned. You don't even have to be part of\na big company to have these types of issues, as the fact is that the moment\nyou get a group of people together and working, there are bound to be issues.\nNot everyone has the same personality or work habits, which can cause friction\nand thereby conflict.\n\nIn your role you\u2019ll need to quickly address these issues, find a positive\nsolution that satisfies both parties, and ensure that the workplace remains\nrespectful, fair, and professional at all times. When you are dealing with\nconflict, it will be important to show empathy and understanding, be discreet\nwhen necessary, patience, positivity, and give reassurance that the conflict\nwill be resolved in a professional manner.\n\nConflict management and problem solving can really stretch your abilities\ndepending on the parties involved in the situation, so this is where your many\nskills and talents will need to be called on.\n\n## Morphing into a More Effective HR Manager\n\nBy using these many tips, you\u2019ll find that you are able to better your skills,\nfurther your knowledge, and really become a more effective HR manager in\ngeneral.\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nyou-can-be-the-best-hr-manager-\npossible%2F&linkname=How%20You%20Can%20be%20the%20Best%20HR%20Manager%20Possible\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nyou-can-be-the-best-hr-manager-\npossible%2F&linkname=How%20You%20Can%20be%20the%20Best%20HR%20Manager%20Possible\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nyou-can-be-the-best-hr-manager-\npossible%2F&linkname=How%20You%20Can%20be%20the%20Best%20HR%20Manager%20Possible\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nyou-can-be-the-best-hr-manager-\npossible%2F&linkname=How%20You%20Can%20be%20the%20Best%20HR%20Manager%20Possible\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nyou-can-be-the-best-hr-manager-\npossible%2F&linkname=How%20You%20Can%20be%20the%20Best%20HR%20Manager%20Possible\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-you-can-be-the-best-hr-manager-possible/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-you-can-be-the-best-hr-manager-possible/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/happy-meetign-2-150x150.png&p\\[title\\]=How You Can be the Best HR Manager Possible)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-you-can-be-the-best-hr-manager-possible/&text=How You Can be the Best HR Manager Possible)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

The Abu Dhabi\nUniversity Knowledge Group surveyed over 100 organisations in the GCC on\nwhether they use psychometric tests, and which ones they use.\n\nWe found that 51 per cent of our sample are currently using psychometrics with\nmany using more than one test as part of their HR initiatives. Of the\norganisations using these tests, 86 per cent use personality questionnaires,\n64 per cent use cognitive ability tests and 48 per cent work with Emotional\nIntelligence questionnaires.\n\nHold on -- what are psychometric tests? They are standardised, scientific\nmeasurements of cognitive ability and personality style. When used correctly,\noccupational psychometric tests can help to select the right people for roles\nin organisations and reduce the risk of a bad hire.\n\nThey can also provide insight into employees' personalities, abilities, and\nother preferences, which can be used to define and support their development\nneeds. Here are a few points that will help you as a hiring manager, or an HR\nprofessional, to minimise potential risks and maximise the predictive accuracy\nof these tests.\n\n **1\\. Determine the business need**\n\nPsychometric tests can only help if you know what you need them to predict.\nFor instance, some of our survey respondents used personality questionnaires\non their own as part of a selection process, when they should have been using\ncognitive ability tests as well. Determining the Key Performance Indicators\n(KPI) of a job role can help one decide which psychometric test to use and\navoid tools that do not fit the bill. Beware of silver-tongued salespeople!\n\n**2\\. Use qualified professionals**\n\nThere is a risk that someone without the appropriate knowledge and experience\nmay use psychometric tests as part of a selection process. This can cause\nserious harm to the participant, as well as the reputation of your\norganisation and that of the test publisher. Personality questionnaires and\ncognitive ability tests are based on scientific research and use distinct\nterminology to explain results.\n\nQualified users are essential for a thorough understanding of reports, and for\ndelivering feedback to participants in a comprehensive, objective and tactful\nmanner. Test users should also know which tools are fit for purpose, and how\nto incorporate psychometrics into your talent management initiatives.\n\n**3\\. Buy reliable and valid tests**\n\nIf you have a British Psychological Society (BPS) Test User on your team, they\nshould be able to recommend appropriate tests for your needs. Look for tests\nthat have been independently reviewed by the BPS or the Buros Centre for\nTesting in the US. Unfortunately, there are well-marketed products available\nthat have not been independently validated and have questionable results.\n\n**4\\. Return on investment**\n\nUltimately, your organisation will want to see a return on the money invested.\nSo, cost-effective and well-designed talent management initiatives are\nrequired to ensure the best possible candidates are attracted, selected,\ndeveloped and managed. Different studies will give you different costs for\nhiring and replacing staff, but here are a couple of references here to give\nyou an idea.\n\nThe Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) produced a report\nin 2015 about Resourcing and Talent Planning in the UK. They estimated that\nthe median cost of hiring senior managers/directors was \u00a37,250 (Dh34,148,\n$9,000). They also estimated the cost for other employees at \u00a32,000 ($2,500).\n\n**Impact on profits**\n\nThe Centre for American Progress (CAP), a high profile public policy research\nand advocacy organisation in the US, pooled data from 30 different US studies\nfor various job categories and found that companies would typically pay about\none-fifth of an employee's annual salary to replace them. Very highly paid\nsenior individuals may cost up to 213 per cent of their annual salary to\nreplace.\n\nNot to mention the potential impact on profits and culture on an organisation\nwhen hiring C-suite level executives.\n\nThe RoI of psychometrics should take into account the cost and the validity of\nthe tools you plan to use. However, if hiring managers and HR professionals\nuse the right tools with the right methodology, they can significantly raise\ntheir chances of selecting, developing and retaining the right talent, and\nsave the cost of a bad hire.\n\n _The writer is a business psychologist specialising in talent management at\nAbu Dhabi University Knowledge Group (ADUKG)._\n\nSign up for Coronavirus Newsletter\n\nLatest local and global Coronavirus news directly to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nPlease enter your email address\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google [Privacy\nPolicy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of\nService](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.\n\n### More From Analysis\n\n[ ![India health quarantine ](https://assets.gulfnews.com/images/spacer.gif)\n](/business/analysis/india-needs-a-new-direction-on-healthcare-1.70844444)\n\nComment\n\n##  [India needs a new direction on healthcare](/business/analysis/india-\nneeds-a-new-direction-on-healthcare-1.70844444)\n\n[ ![SU_191202_UAENationalDay-Thought-Leadership-RASHID-ALSHAMSI-\nLEAD](https://assets.gulfnews.com/images/spacer.gif)\n](/business/analysis/prepping-a-ceo-for-the-covid-19-calamity-1.70835790)\n\nComment\n\n##  [Prepping a CEO for the COVID-19 calamity](/business/analysis/prepping-a-\nceo-for-the-covid-19-calamity-1.70835790)\n\n[ ![man online computer\ngeneric](https://assets.gulfnews.com/images/spacer.gif)\n](/business/analysis/covid-19-shows-up-tech-progress-1.1586149979704)\n\nComment\n\n##  [There's a limit to what tech can do in COVID-19\ntimes](/business/analysis/covid-19-shows-up-tech-progress-1.1586149979704)\n\n[ ![1.2198377-3160924956](https://assets.gulfnews.com/images/spacer.gif)\n](/business/analysis/covid-19-response-reviving-a-virus-inflicted-economy-\nbegins-now-1.70806750)\n\nComment\n\n##  [Reviving a virus-inflicted economy begins\nnow](/business/analysis/covid-19-response-reviving-a-virus-inflicted-economy-\nbegins-now-1.70806750)\n\n## Trending\n\n  * [ ![Negotiating UAE rental contracts in times of COVID-19](https://assets.gulfnews.com/images/spacer.gif) ](/business/analysis/uae-negotiating-rental-contracts-in-times-of-covid-19-1.70803440)\n\n##  [Negotiating UAE rental contracts in times of\nCOVID-19](/business/analysis/uae-negotiating-rental-contracts-in-times-of-\ncovid-19-1.70803440)\n\n* * *\n\n  * [ ![Saving cash is the only priority for UAE businesses](https://assets.gulfnews.com/images/spacer.gif) ](/business/covid-19-counter-uae-businesses-are-out-to-save-their-cash-1.70834268)\n\n##  [Saving cash is the only priority for UAE\nbusinesses](/business/covid-19-counter-uae-businesses-are-out-to-save-their-\ncash-1.70834268)\n\n* * *\n\n  * [ ![UAE's NMC still hopeful of last-minute deal with banks](https://assets.gulfnews.com/images/spacer.gif) ](/business/banking/uk-courts-intervention-is-worst-case-scenario-says-nmc-health-chairman-1.1586237266028)\n\nExclusive\n\n##  [UAE's NMC still hopeful of last-minute deal with\nbanks](/business/banking/uk-courts-intervention-is-worst-case-scenario-says-\nnmc-health-chairman-1.1586237266028)\n\n* * *\n\n  * [ ![Prepping a CEO for the COVID-19 calamity](https://assets.gulfnews.com/images/spacer.gif) ](/business/analysis/prepping-a-ceo-for-the-covid-19-calamity-1.70835790)\n\nComment\n\n##  [Prepping a CEO for the COVID-19 calamity](/business/analysis/prepping-a-\nceo-for-the-covid-19-calamity-1.70835790)\n\n* * *\n\n  * [ ![UAE economy can expect second-half uplift on stimulus](https://assets.gulfnews.com/images/spacer.gif) ](/business/covid-19-exit-uae-economy-can-expect-a-second-half-bounce-1.70705263)\n\n##  [UAE economy can expect second-half uplift on\nstimulus](/business/covid-19-exit-uae-economy-can-expect-a-second-half-\nbounce-1.70705263)\n\n* * *\n\n  * [ ![Life insurance: 7 reasons why you need it today](https://assets.gulfnews.com/images/spacer.gif) ](/business/personal-finance/7-reasons-you-really-need-life-insurance-1.1585815875639)\n\nPartner Content\n\n##  [Life insurance: 7 reasons why you need it today](/business/personal-\nfinance/7-reasons-you-really-need-life-insurance-1.1585815875639)\n\nSign up for Coronavirus Newsletter\n\nLatest local and global Coronavirus news directly to your inbox\n\nSubscribe\n\nPlease enter your email address\n\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google [Privacy\nPolicy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [Terms of\nService](https://policies.google.com/terms) apply.\n\n### Latest In\n\n  * ##

There is a shock and awe to the sudden loss, even if the death\nis expected. One second the person is animated, and next they have gone. It is\nreasonable in this time to hope that you would be given [bereavement\nleave](https://www.ashesmemorialjewellery.com/blog/bereavement-leave) from\nyour workplace. Most managers will show intelligent compassion at this time;\nhowever, it is always best to be informed of your rights. We hope this guide\nis some use in this challenging period.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sad-1.png)\n\n**What is bereavement leave?**\n\nBereavement leave is the time off given to employees in the immediate\naftermath of the loss of a close family member.  You may know it better as\ncompassionate leave \u2013 it is the same thing.  The amount of time given often\nshould be agreed between the employer and employee, but it is hoped that your\ncompany has a clear policy of what is expected of managers at this time.\n\nThe point of the leave is to deal with the immediate emergency and shock.  You\nmay be permitted a further time to enable you to attend the funeral.\n\nYou may need to ask for a more extended period of leave, should the loss cause\nyou such distress.  It may be that your employer will allow you to use holiday\ntime, or you may need to call in sick.\n\n**The law and bereavement leave**\n\nThe law asks employers to offer a \"reasonable\" amount of time.  This time is\npurposely vague to allow for the many different contexts that surround death.\nHR departments should have a clear policy of what this means in your\nworkplace.\n\nACAS offer the guidance that \"reasonable\" means two days in the immediate\naftermath.  Most companies adhere to this advice.  Some other businesses may\nprovide up to five days of unpaid leave.  Exceptional companies will offer\npaid leave in the event of the loss of a close family member.\n\nIt may seem harsh, and it is in no way representative of the time needed in\nthe event of a bereavement.  However, many companies cannot afford to have\nteam members away for extended periods \u2013 and the law is required to represent\na balance between the needs of the organisation and the individual.\n\n**What is meant by close family?**\n\nThe law does specify that bereavement leave only covers close family members.\nThis includes your spouse or long-term partner.  It also refers to your\nchildren, parents, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews.  If you are responsible\nfor an individual and they are considered your dependent, you also qualify for\nbereavement leave.\n\nThis definition might feel unreasonable to you.  Many people consider their\nclosest friends as a loved one.  It might be that the loss of this individual\ncould devastate us more than a family member.  In these situations, you are\nnot covered by bereavement leave law, but you may be able to negotiate the\ncase with your manager.\n\nAny time taken as bereavement leave mustn't be recorded as sickness leave.\nAccruing too much sick leave can result in disciplinary action \u2013 bereavement\nleave cannot.\n\n**How do you know if you need bereavement leave?**\n\nIt might seem reasonable to believe that it will take months, maybe years, to\nrecover from this feeling of overwhelming grief.  Therefore, you know you\ncannot work, so you know you need bereavement leave.  However, our mental\nhealth is a complex creature.  Often, we allow ourselves to heal by sticking\nto our routines.  It may be that going back to work will let you experience\nmoments when you forget your loss.  It will also allow you to be around\npeople, which is so important. Social isolation can heighten distress at these\ntimes.\n\n**How to ask for bereavement leave**\n\nIt is hoped there will be a clear policy of what to do in the event of a\ndeath.  There should be a phone you ring and an emergency number in out of\nhour contexts.  If not, you should ring your direct line manager or ask\nsomeone close to you to do this.\n\nWhen ringing to ask for the bereavement leave, it is best to write down the\nessential details on a piece of paper.  You are going to find it hard to say\nthe words, so reading them will be a little easier.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIt is essential to know that you have the right to some time in the event of\nthe death of a close family member.  It is also vital to keep talking to your\nworkplace to allow them to help you return to work when the time comes.\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbereavement-\nleave-this-is-what-you-need-to-\nknow%2F&linkname=Bereavement%20leave%20%E2%80%93%20this%20is%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbereavement-\nleave-this-is-what-you-need-to-\nknow%2F&linkname=Bereavement%20leave%20%E2%80%93%20this%20is%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbereavement-\nleave-this-is-what-you-need-to-\nknow%2F&linkname=Bereavement%20leave%20%E2%80%93%20this%20is%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbereavement-\nleave-this-is-what-you-need-to-\nknow%2F&linkname=Bereavement%20leave%20%E2%80%93%20this%20is%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fbereavement-\nleave-this-is-what-you-need-to-\nknow%2F&linkname=Bereavement%20leave%20%E2%80%93%20this%20is%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/bereavement-leave-this-is-what-you-need-to-know/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/bereavement-leave-this-is-what-you-need-to-know/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sad-1-150x150.png&p\\[title\\]=Bereavement leave \u2013 this is what you need to know)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/bereavement-leave-this-is-what-you-need-to-know/&text=Bereavement leave \u2013 this is what you need to know)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

One solution is to invest in absence management technology, which\ncan help managers uncover the real reasons someone has been off sick.\n\n\u201cAbsence management software enables managers to track short and long-term\nabsences, and prompts return to work interviews. Managers can clearly see if\nsomeone has been taking a lot of time off or recurring patterns, such as\nsomeone regularly off on a Monday which may indicate stress or worry.\n\n\u201cThis insight is invaluable and can enable line managers to sit down with\nsomeone and privately discuss what may be causing them to be absent from work\nfrequently. If it appears someone is suffering from stress, anxiety or\ndepression, then managers can step in and help by either directing them to\nrelevant support services or addressing things like heavy workloads and other\npressures, which could be contributing to the issue.\n\n\u201cEmployers can also try to do more to create more openness around mental\nhealth. Sending an email on World Mental Health Day to your team, letting them\nknow about the awareness day and encouraging them to ask a colleague how they\nare that day, is one simple action that could be done on 10th October.\n\n\u201cHowever it\u2019s something that employers need to be doing more of throughout the\nyear to really start to see a difference. Starting conversations around mental\nhealth and getting to the root causes of absenteeism is a good place to start\nto break down the stigma of mental health issues and encourage a more open\nculture,\u201d adds Mr Lewis.\n\nOne organisation that has been using absence management software since March\n2019 is Widcombe Surgery, a GP practice in Bath with six GP partners.  The\nsurgery has benefitted from the return to work interviews that are an integral\npart of the software.\n\nPractice Manager Elaine Smith says, \u201cThe software prompts me to have a\nconversation with a member of staff who has been off sick and provides the\nright questions to guide the conversation. It\u2019s really useful for managers who\nmay be worried about asking difficult questions and can help them identify\nwhen someone may be struggling.\n\n\u201cFor example, someone may have returned to work from bereavement leave before\nthey are ready but by asking questions tailored to identify any issues, the\ninterview should highlight that they are not coping. This means their manager\ncan then suggest solutions to help them manage better such as taking an extra\nday off or working a shorter week in the short term.\u201d\n\nFor more information visit:\n[www.activabsence.co.uk](http://www.activabsence.co.uk)  \n\n* * *\n\n[i] <https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2019/10/10/default-\ncalendar/world-mental-health-day-2019-focus-on-suicide-prevention>\n\n[ii] <https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/news/articles/workers-call-in-\nphysically-sick-hide-mental-ill-health>\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Funderstanding-\nthe-root-causes-of-absenteeism-can-help-employers-tackle-mental-health-in-the-\nworkplace%2F&linkname=Understanding%20the%20root%20causes%20of%20absenteeism%20can%20help%20employers%20tackle%20mental%20health%20in%20the%20workplace\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Funderstanding-\nthe-root-causes-of-absenteeism-can-help-employers-tackle-mental-health-in-the-\nworkplace%2F&linkname=Understanding%20the%20root%20causes%20of%20absenteeism%20can%20help%20employers%20tackle%20mental%20health%20in%20the%20workplace\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Funderstanding-\nthe-root-causes-of-absenteeism-can-help-employers-tackle-mental-health-in-the-\nworkplace%2F&linkname=Understanding%20the%20root%20causes%20of%20absenteeism%20can%20help%20employers%20tackle%20mental%20health%20in%20the%20workplace\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Funderstanding-\nthe-root-causes-of-absenteeism-can-help-employers-tackle-mental-health-in-the-\nworkplace%2F&linkname=Understanding%20the%20root%20causes%20of%20absenteeism%20can%20help%20employers%20tackle%20mental%20health%20in%20the%20workplace\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Funderstanding-\nthe-root-causes-of-absenteeism-can-help-employers-tackle-mental-health-in-the-\nworkplace%2F&linkname=Understanding%20the%20root%20causes%20of%20absenteeism%20can%20help%20employers%20tackle%20mental%20health%20in%20the%20workplace\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/understanding-the-root-causes-of-absenteeism-can-help-employers-tackle-mental-health-in-the-workplace/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/understanding-the-root-causes-of-absenteeism-can-help-employers-tackle-mental-health-in-the-workplace/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/stressed-worker-150x150.png&p\\[title\\]=Understanding the root causes of absenteeism can help employers tackle mental health in the workplace)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/understanding-the-root-causes-of-absenteeism-can-help-employers-tackle-mental-health-in-the-workplace/&text=Understanding the root causes of absenteeism can help employers tackle mental health in the workplace)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog -

By simply leaving such an\nimportant matter to chance, businesses are running the risk of finding\nthemselves in hot water.\u201d\n\nHere Lindsey sets out some key considerations when drawing up a social media\npolicy:\n\n**1)     ****Set out who owns what when it comes to social media**\n\nEnsure the ownership of the company\u2019s social media accounts belongs to the\nbusiness - rather than the employee responsible for updating and monitoring\nthem -  to avoid expensive legal battles at a later date.\n\n**2)     ****Issue guidelines on what they can and can\u2019t post**\n\nMake it clear that defamatory comments, discriminatory, racist or sexist\nlanguage, the sharing of sensitive commercial information or information about\ncolleagues, negative statements about the company and inappropriate jokes will\nresult in, at best, disciplinary action, and at worst, a termination of\nemployment. Bear in mind that private messages need to be included in these\nguidelines to ensure that confidential information isn\u2019t shared on social\nmedia.\n\nIt is also important to ensure employees understand the law around\nintellectual property. For example, if an employee controlling the firm\u2019s\nsocial media posts an image \u2013 be it a photograph or a picture \u2013 that was\ncreated by someone else, that constitutes a breach of copyright. However, it\nis not a breach of copyright to include in a post a hyperlink to that same\nimage.\n\n**3)     ****Identify those members of staff who will participate in social\nmedia on behalf of your company and assign roles**\n\nThere may be one person who has already been identified as a good company\nadvocate and is comfortable engaging with clients or customers through social\nmedia, or maybe you\u2019re starting your search from scratch; whoever you chose to\nrepresent your company online, make sure the social media policy sets out\nwhich employees have permission to post, and what sort of content is\nconsidered acceptable.\n\nAllocate roles to those involved in posting so that employees know who is\nresponsible for the areas of strategy, response to any crises, customer\nengagement and password management.\n\n**4)     ****Include security processes**\n\nIn order to protect social media accounts from attacks, passwords and\norganisational software need to be updated regularly. The name of the person\nor people responsible for doing so \u2013 and for other aspects of social media\nsecurity - should be shared in the policy to ensure the accounts are protected\nand that employees know who to contact if they have a problem.\n\n**5)     ****Make it clear that the policy applies to employees whether\nthey\u2019re posting inside or out of the workplace**\n\nThere is a tendency for people to think that what they post in their own time\nbears no relation to their employment, but that\u2019s not necessarily the case. If\nany sort of a link can be made between the employee and your organisation,\nthen a problematic post is still a problematic post \u2013 no matter what time of\nday it is posted.\n\n**6)     ****Set out exactly what constitutes overuse of personal online\nactivity in work** ****\n\nIt\u2019s vital to include an acceptable use policy outlining appropriate personal\nonline activity during working hours, be it social media, email or internet,\nas you may need to rely on it should an employee\u2019s performance suffer due to\nexcessive time spent online.\n\nSet out prohibited websites, the extent of online activity that will be\ntolerated during a working day, and remind them that their internet activity\nmay be monitored now and again.\n\nExplain why you have set up the policies you have, and it\u2019s more likely that\nyour workforce will be on board.\n\n**7)     ****Don\u2019t gag your employees** ****\n\nAny attempts to prevent employees from posting on social media could result in\nsome serious freedom of speech issues, so don\u2019t try and stop them from doing\nso. Instead, educate staff as to what they can do to support the business on\nsocial media and help drive more people to its website.\n\n**8)     ****Educate your team about malware** ****\n\nAll it takes is a click on a social media link for your network to come under\nattack, so educate employees on how to recognise suspicious messages and links\nin order to protect your system.\n\n**9)     ****Ask for specialist input** ****\n\nWhether it\u2019s your HR department or your legal adviser, it\u2019s vital to ask other\nmembers of your team for specialist input to ensure all your bases are\ncovered. A solicitor, for example, will be able to advise you on the wording\nneeded in your policy to ensure no copyright rules are breached when sharing\nthird-party content, while your HR team can advise on parts of the policy that\ncould impact on employees\u2019 contracts.\n\n**10)** **Make the policy easily accessible** ****\n\nIt could be housed on your company intranet or in employee handbooks, but\nwherever you choose to publish it, make sure the social media policy is easy\nfor all employees to access.\n\n**11   ****) Offer employees the opportunity to learn** ****\n\nWhether they\u2019ve just dipped their toe in the water or are regular social media\nposters, employees should be offered the opportunity to learn more about how\nthey can interact with people on behalf of your organisation, helping to raise\ntheir own profile and that of the business in the process.\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nto-implement-a-social-media-policy-that-doesnt-infringe-an-employees-human-\nrights%2F&linkname=How%20to%20implement%20a%20social%20media%20policy%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20infringe%20an%20employee%E2%80%99s%20human%20rights\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nto-implement-a-social-media-policy-that-doesnt-infringe-an-employees-human-\nrights%2F&linkname=How%20to%20implement%20a%20social%20media%20policy%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20infringe%20an%20employee%E2%80%99s%20human%20rights\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nto-implement-a-social-media-policy-that-doesnt-infringe-an-employees-human-\nrights%2F&linkname=How%20to%20implement%20a%20social%20media%20policy%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20infringe%20an%20employee%E2%80%99s%20human%20rights\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nto-implement-a-social-media-policy-that-doesnt-infringe-an-employees-human-\nrights%2F&linkname=How%20to%20implement%20a%20social%20media%20policy%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20infringe%20an%20employee%E2%80%99s%20human%20rights\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nto-implement-a-social-media-policy-that-doesnt-infringe-an-employees-human-\nrights%2F&linkname=How%20to%20implement%20a%20social%20media%20policy%20that%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20infringe%20an%20employee%E2%80%99s%20human%20rights\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-to-implement-a-social-media-policy-that-doesnt-infringe-an-employees-human-rights/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-to-implement-a-social-media-policy-that-doesnt-infringe-an-employees-human-rights/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/social-media-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=How to implement a social media policy that doesn\u2019t infringe an employee\u2019s human rights)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-to-implement-a-social-media-policy-that-doesnt-infringe-an-employees-human-rights/&text=How to implement a social media policy that doesn\u2019t infringe an employee\u2019s human rights)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog -

With this in mind, it is timely to consider\nthe HR implications of such a development.\n\nWhile the majority of the media coverage has focused on the stranded\nholidaymakers, from an HR perspective, it is important to recognise an\nestimated 9,000 Thomas Cook UK employees have lost their jobs. Given that the\ncompany has ceased trading, this will be considered a redundancy situation.\n\nAlthough much of the procedure is likely to be informed by Thomas Cook\u2019s\nredundancy policy, employees will be entitled to statutory redundancy pay\nproviding they meet the requirement for two years\u2019 service. The legislation\nprovides different pay rates for staff, depending on their age and length of\nservice. However, given the lack of funds, it is unclear whether Thomas Cook\nwould be able to cover these redundancy payments. In this situation, employees\nwill need to apply to the National Insurance fund to claim payment covering\nredundancy pay and any unpaid wages, accrued holiday and notice pay.  \n\nTypically, employers who are planning to make 100 or more employees redundant\nare required to take part in a collective consultation lasting at least 45\ndays before any dismissal takes place. However, it would appear that Thomas\nCook\u2019s sudden collapse did not allow for this consultation to occur. Meaning\nthere is the possibility that staff who are made redundant could make a claim\nof failure to carry out a consultation.\n\nAs well as direct employers, there may be individuals in other organisations\nthat rely on Thomas Cook\u2019s continued operations for their own business, such\nas coach drivers for package holidays. In these situations, there may be a\nlack of available work created by Thomas Cook\u2019s closure and it would help the\nrespective employers if there was a lay-off provision within employee\ncontracts, legally allowing them to prevent staff from attending work\nunnecessarily.\n\nDuring this time, those with at least one months\u2019 service will be entitled to\nstatutory guarantee pay. This calculation is made by multiplying the number of\nhours the employee would have worked on the day in question by their\nguaranteed hourly rate. The amount is capped at a maximum of \u00a329 per day and\nthe payment is limited to 5 days within any rolling three-month period.\n\nIt is also essential to consider those employers who may have staff stranded\nabroad due to flight cancellations. Well-constructed absence policies will\nhelp form the basis of any approach. However, HR personnel are encouraged to\nshow a degree of leniency under the circumstances. Staff are sure to benefit\nfrom employer support in these situations and it will be a good idea to give\nthem the opportunity to use any remaining annual leave to cover the absence,\nor alternatively take this as unpaid leave.\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fwhat-\ncan-hr-learn-from-the-collapse-of-thomas-\ncook%2F&linkname=What%20can%20HR%20learn%20from%20the%20collapse%20of%20Thomas%20Cook%3F\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fwhat-\ncan-hr-learn-from-the-collapse-of-thomas-\ncook%2F&linkname=What%20can%20HR%20learn%20from%20the%20collapse%20of%20Thomas%20Cook%3F\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fwhat-\ncan-hr-learn-from-the-collapse-of-thomas-\ncook%2F&linkname=What%20can%20HR%20learn%20from%20the%20collapse%20of%20Thomas%20Cook%3F\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fwhat-\ncan-hr-learn-from-the-collapse-of-thomas-\ncook%2F&linkname=What%20can%20HR%20learn%20from%20the%20collapse%20of%20Thomas%20Cook%3F\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fwhat-\ncan-hr-learn-from-the-collapse-of-thomas-\ncook%2F&linkname=What%20can%20HR%20learn%20from%20the%20collapse%20of%20Thomas%20Cook%3F\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/what-can-hr-learn-from-the-collapse-of-thomas-cook/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/what-can-hr-learn-from-the-collapse-of-thomas-cook/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/thomas-cook-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=What can HR learn from the collapse of Thomas Cook?)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/what-can-hr-learn-from-the-collapse-of-thomas-cook/&text=What can HR learn from the collapse of Thomas Cook?)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

While the coronavirus is a type of virus\nthat is fairly common across the world, Wuhan novel coronavirus is a new\nstrain of the virus. According to the World Health Organisation, the number of\ncases reported has exceeded 40,000 and the number of deaths has reached over\n900[i].\n\nJo Stubbs, XpertHR\u2019s Head of Product Content Strategy, says, \u201cWith the spread\nof the coronavirus, it\u2019s important for employers to consider what they can do\nto protect their business and workforce. For example, they should issue clear\nguidance to employees who have recently travelled to China or who have been in\ncontact with someone who has.\n\n\u201cIf they haven\u2019t already got one, employers should consider putting in place a\nflu pandemic contingency plan to address business continuity in case the\nsituation worsens. They should also consider implementing an infectious\ndiseases in the workplace policy to ensure a clear approach to minimising the\nrisk of the coronavirus being contracted and spread.\u201d\n\nXpertHR offers the following guidance:\n\n  * **If an employee has symptoms associated with the coronavirus, can they be instructed not to come to work?   ******\n\nEmployers are under a duty to ensure the health and safety of all their\nemployees and to provide a safe place and system of work. These duties exist\nunder both common law and statute. Employees are also under a duty to take\nreasonable care to ensure that they do not endanger themselves or anyone who\nmay be affected by their acts or omissions at work.\n\nIn light of these duties, and the serious implications for their business if\nthe coronavirus is contracted and spread in the workplace, employers would be\njustified in instructing any employee with the symptoms associated with the\ncoronavirus not to attend work, and to seek a diagnosis from a medical\nprofessional and not return to work until the symptoms have cleared.\n\n  * **Is there any duty on employers to close their workplace to prevent the spread of viruses such as the coronavirus?** ****\n\nThere is generally no requirement for employers to close their workplace\nduring a flu pandemic or an infectious disease outbreak, but employers should\ncheck guidance from the Department of Health or the relevant public health\nbody on a regular basis.\n\n  * **Can an employer insist that an employee who has flu-like symptoms is tested for the coronavirus?** ****\n\nEmployers cannot insist that their employees are tested for flu. Testing an\nemployee without their agreement would constitute a criminal assault and could\nalso result in a claim for constructive unfair dismissal. In order for an\nemployer to require an employee to submit to a test for flu, it would need a\ncontractual right to do so. Even then, the employee must be willing to be\ntested.\n\n  * **Do employers have a duty to take special measures to protect those employees who are most at risk if they are exposed to the coronavirus?** ****\n\nEmployers should check guidance from the Department of Health or the relevant\npublic health body on any health conditions that could make someone vulnerable\nto becoming seriously ill with the coronavirus. People at particular risk\ncould include those with weakened immune systems, older workers, and those\nwith long-term conditions like diabetes, cancer and chronic lung disease.\n\nGiven the duty to ensure the health and safety of their employees, employers\nshould consider measures to protect these employees from the risk of\ninfection, for example by reassigning staff from high-risk work sites or\nlocations. Employers are also under special duties in relation to pregnant\nemployees and disabled workers.\n\nFor more indepth answers to these questions and a model Infectious diseases in\nthe workplace policy and Flu pandemic contingency plan, please visit XpertHR\u2019s\nInfectious Diseases topic page\n\nFor more information on XpertHR visit: www.xperthr.co.uk\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fguidance-\nfor-employers-in-relation-to-the-\ncoronavirus%2F&linkname=Guidance%20for%20employers%20in%20relation%20to%20the%20Coronavirus\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fguidance-\nfor-employers-in-relation-to-the-\ncoronavirus%2F&linkname=Guidance%20for%20employers%20in%20relation%20to%20the%20Coronavirus\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fguidance-\nfor-employers-in-relation-to-the-\ncoronavirus%2F&linkname=Guidance%20for%20employers%20in%20relation%20to%20the%20Coronavirus\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fguidance-\nfor-employers-in-relation-to-the-\ncoronavirus%2F&linkname=Guidance%20for%20employers%20in%20relation%20to%20the%20Coronavirus\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fguidance-\nfor-employers-in-relation-to-the-\ncoronavirus%2F&linkname=Guidance%20for%20employers%20in%20relation%20to%20the%20Coronavirus\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/guidance-for-employers-in-relation-to-the-coronavirus/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/guidance-for-employers-in-relation-to-the-coronavirus/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sick-2-150x150.png&p\\[title\\]=Guidance for employers in relation to the Coronavirus)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/guidance-for-employers-in-relation-to-the-coronavirus/&text=Guidance for employers in relation to the Coronavirus)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

In the current climate, the ability of\nHR directors to add strategic value in organisations is critical. So, what is\nholding HR back, from becoming the strategic function it needs to be?\n\n\"You only have to look at how so few HRDs ever make it to CEO to understand\nwhy,\" says Glenn Jones, HR consultant to HSBC and Bank of America, and author\nof recently published book Human resources changes the world. \"HRDs still seem\nto have a victim-mentality. Despite all the chatter about the need for\nstrategic HR, the problem HRDs face is a systemic one around the function\nitself,\" he adds: \"with all the transactional elements of hiring, inducting,\ntraining and paying their people, that they simply don't have the time to add\nthe strategic string to their bow.\"\n\nHR is often, unfairly, accused of being fixated with creating 'compliance'\nrather than 'capability'. \"It's like HR lives in a constant state of deja vu,\"\nsays Jo Taylor, former director of talent and resourcing at TalkTalk Group,\nand founder of HR consultancy Let's Talk Talent. \"On the one hand HRDs say\nthey want to be more strategic, but on the other, they haven't changed with\nthe times - they still use the Ulrich model (20-plus years and counting), and\nthey still use the nine-box matrix. Using the same tools but expecting\ndifferent results won't work.\"\n\n![](https://d2dzik4ii1e1u6.cloudfront.net/images/lexology/static/50940940-9b67-4081-97bf-f64c5307487c.PNG)\n\nIn theory, CEOs should fully support and defend their HRDs. PwC's annual CEO\nReport 2018 reveals that alongside the things the boss has absolutely no\ncontrol over - like terrorism, cyber-attacks and overregulation - the\navailability of key skills is now a top five worry (rising from 31 per cent of\nglobal CEOs polled in 2017 to 38 per cent this year), and something that is\nvery much in their power to change if talent is a board-level conversation.\nBut, as Taylor adds: \"For HR to be strategic, it's as much a task of changing\nwho it reports to as anything else. Report to the CFO (as most HRDs do) and HR\nwill only ever be talked about from an operational perspective. Report to the\nCEO and HR has the chance to make a difference.\"\n\nBeing 'strategic' necessitates being able to come up with a strategy. As Nigel\nDavies, founder of digital workplace Claromentis says: \"Strategic HR is HR\nwith an agenda.\" So, could better HR technology be the salvation they have\nbeen looking for?\n\nTechnology certainly gives the HR function a new vernacular - because just\nhaving better HR technology will improve the efficiency of HR itself - which\ncan bring strategic visibility to the HR function. In Ius Laboris's forces for\nchange research, a staggering 82 per cent of respondents either 'somewhat' or\n'completely agreed' that 'the power of digital and data analytics will help to\ntransform the HR function and enhance their understanding of how employees\nwork, The Hackett Group's global 2018 HR Benchmarking Report, also confirms\nthis. It finds better use of technology can accelerate HR departments to\n'world class' status in less than five years, and for a company with $10\nbillion in revenue, attaining world-class performance in HR represents as much\nas $14 million in cost savings annually.\n\n\"Technology enables HR to connect with the business,\" argues Alex Moyle,\nauthor of Business development culture. \"If the strategy of a business is to\nimprove sales by X-per cent, it's technology that has the power to identify\nwho the best hires have been, what skillsets need to be found in further\nhiring, how psychometrics relate to sales performance, whether specific\ntraining received can be linked to faster new business gains. This is the sort\nof data that CEOs listen to.\" According to Moyle, marketing departments have\nbeen using data like this for years and have the ear of the CEO not just\nbecause the data they present them is rich, but because it allows for faster\ndecision-making.\n\nBut perhaps the most immediate issue for HRDs is the sheer proliferation of\ntechnology to choose from. As well as large enterprise-wide HR\nsystems/dashboards that can catalogue the skillsets of all staff, and cross\nreference them against skills gaps for talent planning, recruitment and\nretention strategies, there are a host of single-play providers with very\nspecific applications. These include a raft of predictive technology\nproviders, including disruptive firms like Good & Co which has created a\npsychometrics test that works out if job applicants' thinking style is\ncompatible with the people or the culture of the company they might be working\nfor. Where do HRDs even begin to look?\n\n\"Maybe the key is less about what the technology can do, but more what insight\nit provides,\" suggests Will Hamilton, CEO of LauchPad Recruits, provider of\nAI-enabled recruitment technology. Its technology examines how recruiters\nmanually score interviewees, to ensure fatigue or bias doesn't set in. It also\nensures that people are selected against what 'excellent' in a job is supposed\nto look like (based on how previous hires have performed on-the-job).\nInsightful data like this, he argues turns HRDs from operators to strategists.\n\"At the moment, the siloed nature of HR means the rest of the business isn't\nlinking things like what HR does in recruitment with quality of hire further\ndownstream,\" he says. \"Just compiling recruitment conversion rates or time to\nhire data won't move the strategic needle, but more analytical data does. What\nHRDs need is to take the analytics to the boardroom rather than the technology\nitself.\"\n\nAt the moment though, there is some debate about how close HR professionals\nget to doing the analytics themselves. Devyani Vaishampayan - a former interim\nglobal head of HR at Rolls Royce, and ex-regional HRD at G4S - is so convinced\nHR should know more about the strategic impact of HR technology that she's set\nup a venture capitalist company - the HR Tech Partnership - whereby fellow\nHRDs actually invest in HR technology start-ups. She says: \"One firm we've\ninvested in can scan a million CVs a day; another is using emotion sensing AI\nto see how a corporate culture is evolving.\" She adds: \"The key though with\nany technology is that it should enable HR to predict change rather than react\nto it - it's this predictive element that has the ability to take HR strategy\nto a whole new level.\" She says: \"Statistics out there suggest 25 per cent of\nHRDs are looking at AI, but my suspicion is that it's lower. What's really\nimportant is that HRDs gain familiarity with technology - because they need to\nspot the difference between what is hype and what will make a difference.\"\n\n> \"For HR to be strategic, it's as much a task of changing who it reports to\n> as anything else\"\n\nRecently published research by LinkedIn certainly argues the rise of the 'HR\nanalyst' is potentially on the cusp, as professionals seek out the\ntechnological skills they think will make them shine internally. It reveals\nthere has been a 49 per cent year-on-year rise in people listing HR analytics\nas a skill on their profile, with 19 per cent of UK businesses adopting HR\nanalytics and 11 per cent creating an actual role in that name. Hamilton\nargues analytics requires a \"very certain skillset\" however, and HRDs would be\nbest suited hiring analysts to do the legwork for them, and then interpreting\nthe data they're given.\n\nBut maybe it's just adaptability that HRDs really need to show. Greg Pryor\nhead of people and performance at Workday, argues HRDs simply need have the\nanalytics at their fingertips to answer the new questions CEOs are asking:\n\"CEOs are realising they need to start thinking bigger,\" he says. \"As they\nincreasingly turn to HR leaders as strategic guides for a new business world,\nit's important they have the answers to three key questions: How can they\nsupport their company's growth initiatives and develop an agile talent\nstrategy that ensures they have the right people in place at the right time?;\nhow can they develop a culture that attracts, engages, and retains the best\nworkforce?; and how can they tackle issues like cultural dilution and\nperformance enablement and get their CEO and board 'on-board'?\"\n\nUndoubtedly, some of these questions are 'big', but if technology is used\nappropriately, experts argue HR can lend new insight. Geoffroy de Lestrange,\nassociate director of product marketing at Cornerstone OnDemand says: \"In the\nface of change, HR must adapt much like finance and marketing did a decade\nago.\" He adds: \"If HR cannot develop a people management strategy that aligns\nwith the business ambition, then it cannot be a legitimate part of the\nleadership team.\"\n\nAnne-Laure Peries of the French Ius Laboris firm, CAPSTAN Avocats, says she\nstrongly believes in the use of innovative technology for HR directors. \"As\nthe rest of the board will be making more and more decisions based on data\nanalytics, it's only natural that HR directors should do the same.\" They will\nhave to show their ability to analyse data globally - and it will be crucial\nfor them to be familiar with big data because, from a European perspective at\nleast, they will need to implement the General Data Protection Regulation.\n\"This means HR directors will have to become more familar with the way\npersonal data are colllected, stored and analysed by AI.\"\n\nBut there is, it feels, hope ahead. A recent (2017) Cornerstone and IDC study\nfound that only a fifth (17 per cent) of HR directors were 'not' part of their\ncompany's digital transformation strategy. Hamilton concludes: \"The\nconversation has, I believe, moved on. People understand technology touches us\nin all areas of our life. HR is now just one of those functions where\ntechnology is making an impact. Technology used to support decision-making at\na strategic level can only be a good thing.\"\n\n__ Back __ Forward\n\n  * [ __ Save & file  ](/account/login?ReturnUrl=%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3d4eb928f2-2b20-47ba-9f45-d3a5034cf3ea)\n  * [ __ View original  ](/library/document.ashx?g=1694cb5d-ffaa-452c-b25c-04a82ca95ad7 \"View the original document this article came from\")\n  * [ __ Forward  ](mailto:?body=I%20thought%20you%20might%20be%20interested%20in%20this%20article%20on%20Lexology%3A%20HR%20-%20A%20strategic%20function.%20%0A%0D%0AYou%20can%20access%20the%20article%20for%20free%20using%20this%20link%3A%20%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lexology.com%2Fr.ashx%3Fl%3D8V8C3RS%20%0A%0D%0ALexology.com%20-%20legal%20intelligence.&subject=Lexology%3A%20HR%20-%20A%20strategic%20function. \"Forward this article to a colleague via email\")\n  * [ __ Print  ](javascript:LogPrint\\(\\); window.print\\(\\); \"Print this article\")\n  * __ Share\n\n    * [ __Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lexology.com%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3d4eb928f2-2b20-47ba-9f45-d3a5034cf3ea)\n    * [ __Twitter](https://twitter.com/home?status=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lexology.com%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3d4eb928f2-2b20-47ba-9f45-d3a5034cf3ea)\n    * [ __Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lexology.com%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3d4eb928f2-2b20-47ba-9f45-d3a5034cf3ea&title=&summary=&source=)\n\n  * __ Follow \n\nPlease login to follow content.\n\n  * [Like](/account/login?ReturnUrl=%2flibrary%2fdetail.aspx%3fg%3d4eb928f2-2b20-47ba-9f45-d3a5034cf3ea)\n\n__\n\nadd to folder:\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader-spin.gif)\n\n  * My saved (default)\n  * Read later ![](/images/ajax-loader-spin.gif)\n\nFolders shared with you\n\n  * ![](/images/ajax-loader-spin.gif)\n\n### Filed under\n\n  * [Belgium](/hub/belgium)\n  * [European Union](/hub/european-union)\n  * [Global](/hub/global)\n  * [USA](/hub/usa)\n  * [Corporate Finance/M&A](/hub/corporate-finance-m-and-a)\n  * [Employment & Labor](/hub/employment-and-labor)\n  * [IT & Data Protection](/hub/it-and-data-protection)\n  * [Law Firm Management](/hub/law-firm-management)\n  * [Ius Laboris](/search/?f=1015515)\n\n### Tagged with\n\n  * [Big data](/hub/big-data)\n  * [GDPR](/hub/gdpr)\n  * [HSBC](/hub/hsbc)\n\n### Popular articles from this firm\n\n  1. #####  [ How employers in European countries should deal with workplace sexual harassment * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=5ab39cb3-f3ac-4981-b444-1ddb1d1dd7d0)\n\n  2. #####  [ Streamlining single permit applications for foreign workers: recent developments in Belgium * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=c6ec84b6-31e6-4e32-9e75-5cd9183b9f1f)\n\n  3. #####  [ Belgium - Significant changes in immigration procedures from 2019 * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=482c8c69-d3aa-4a20-9bea-69f395f0f62c)\n\n  4. #####  [ Belgium - What are the HR implications of the new companies code? * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=61b7b12b-7570-4f41-b4c7-d7245eabf782)\n\n  5. #####  [ Coronavirus: an update on measures for employers in Belgium * ](/library/detail.aspx?g=4d4d1acd-9c98-42f9-af80-f1cee72727ee)\n\nIf you would like to learn how Lexology can drive your content marketing\nstrategy forward, please email\n[enquiries@lexology.com](mailto:enquiries@lexology.com \"Email us\").\n\n![Powered by Lexology](/images/redesign_2015/Powered_by_Lexology_Logo-\nprint.png)\n\nCOVID-19\n\nFrom force majeure to employment issues - follow the latest thinking from the\nworld's leading business law firms as the virus continues to spread.\n\n[Visit research centre](https://www.lexology.com/research/hubs/coronavirus)\n\n### Featured Video\n\n[ ![Robert\nBiddlecombe](https://d2dzik4ii1e1u6.cloudfront.net/images/lexology/author/693/W120/H120/20200310160741/Robert_Biddlecombe.jpg)\n](/learn/video/how-to-adapt-when-business-as-usual-isnt-possible)\n\n__3:28 min\n\n#### Robert Biddlecombe\n\n##### Squire Patton Boggs\n\n[\n\n#### How to adapt when 'Business as usual' isn\u2019t possible\n\n](/learn/video/how-to-adapt-when-business-as-usual-isnt-possible)\n\n[Watch now](/learn/video/how-to-adapt-when-business-as-usual-isnt-possible)\n\n###  Related topic hubs\n\n  1.

With the average sickness absence costing \u00a3107.85,\nthis resulted in a big loss for UK businesses.  \n\nThe Office for National Statistics reported that sickness absences had fallen\nto an all-time low in 2017. With this in mind, Viking questioned 2,000 UK\nworkers on changing attitudes towards sick days.  \n\nIt revealed a trend, highlighting that lying to take sick days was more common\namongst younger generations. 71% of 25-34-year olds admitted they\u2019d lied when\ncalling in sick, compared to just 25% of over 65s.\n\nDespite lying to pull a \u2018sickie\u2019 from work being on the rise in UK offices,\nViking\u2019s research highlighted a growing pressure to avoid taking sick days.\n86% of 25-34-year olds reported feeling under pressure to avoid taking sick\ndays, listing reasons such as stress caused by their workload (33%), anxiety\nabout calling in sick (31%) and pressure from their manager (24%). Whereas\nless than half (44%) of over 65s said they feel pressure to avoid taking time\noff.  \n\nYounger generations are also much stricter when it comes to what should\nconstitute a day off:\n\n(% who think it constitutes a day off)\n\n**Illness/ Sickness**  |  **25-34-year olds  ** |  **Over 65s**  \n---|---|---  \nFever |  39% |  63%  \nFood poisoning |  52% |  78%  \nNeeding to go to hospital |  50% |  77%  \nCommon cold |  21% |  16%  \nPoor mental health |  29% |  40%  \n  \n  \nWhile Viking\u2019s research highlighted changing views on sick days, it shows a\nsimilar trend when it comes to company\u2019s policies on sick days. 53% of\n25-34-year olds are unaware of their company\u2019s policy on sick days, compared\nto 27% of over 65s.\n\nMany of the younger generation also raised questions over their employer\u2019s\nhandling of sick days. 17% said they feel they don\u2019t get enough sick days from\nwork, with 1% of over 65s saying the same. Despite 71% believing it doesn\u2019t\nconstitute a day off, one-third (33%) believe mental health sick days should\nbe separate to regular sick days, compared to 11% of over 65s.  \n\n**Bob Huibers,  Marketing Executive at Viking, commented on the research:**\n\n> \u201cBusinesses should be aware of the changing attitudes towards taking sick\n> days. With absences falling to an all-time low, younger generations are\n> forcing themselves into the office with colds, fevers, and poor mental\n> health. Not only will this take its toll on employee\u2019s health, but it will\n> see a dip in productivity during office hours as well.\n\n> \u201cCommunicating a fair policy and helping employees understand their rights\n> when it comes to taking sick days will help reduce the pressure and stigma\n> surrounding the subject.

resulting in UK PLC facing \u00a32.8bn in lost productivity each year.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/money-1.jpg)\n\nThe survey of 150 financial controllers\u2019 attitudes to expense management found\nthat 23% of UK businesses \u2013 that\u2019s almost a million companies \u2013 still process\nexpenses using paper-receipts stapled to an expense form. This is leaving\norganisations more vulnerable to expense misuse, as well as being\nsignificantly more likely to waste time chasing incomplete forms \u2013 up to 100\nhours a year.\n\nShockingly, the research found that over half of UK businesses (53%) either do\nnot have an expense policy at all or feel that theirs is not fit for purpose.\n36% of financial controllers surveyed feel that they have insufficient control\nover spending limits.\n\n> _\u201cWith the amount of financial scrutiny that UK companies operate under\n> today, there is no real excuse for financial controllers not to have a clear\n> and efficient expense policy in place_ ,\u201d comments **Jane-Emma Peerless** ,\n> **Chief Commercial Officer** at **Caxton**. _\u201cMany of the organisations we\n> work with are constantly looking at ways to improve their efficiencies and\n> drive costs down. Simply by switching to an automated expense process could\n> improve the productivity of your finance team by nearly 100 hours a year.\u201d_\n\nThe research findings coincide with the launch of Caxton\u2019s  new   **Business\nmanagement** platform. This provides a fully automated end-to-end expense\nsolution, including a choice of two different corporate cards depending on\nbusiness needs, a mobile app to let employees quickly record and store all\ntheir receipts, and back-end functionality that enables accounts teams to\ntrack and manage expenses in real-time.\n\nThe research highlighted that paper receipts are listed as the biggest\nfrustration for financial controllers, and - 35% - mainly in companies with\nunder 500 employees - feel their system places an unnecessary burden on\nemployees. In addition, 35% of companies still ask their employees to pay for\ntheir business expenses out of their own pocket then claim it back.\n\n> **Peerless continues** , _\u201cThere is a big HR issue that needs to be\n> addressed when it comes to managing expense policies and it goes well beyond\n> saving businesses money.   No one likes being out of pocket because of slow\n> or delayed payment for business expenses and it has a direct impact on\n> personal finances. Staff dissatisfaction inevitably contributes to poor\n> company culture - delayed payments could lead to distrust and resentment and\n> it ultimately reflects badly on a business.  Secondly, there is the\n> consideration and motivation of accounts teams who are constantly chasing\n> lost receipts and wrongly submitted expense forms. This is demotivating,\n> wastes time, and does nothing for productivity.\u201d  _\n\nThe research also found that expense misreporting is rife, but that companies\nwith automated expense platforms are slightly less likely to suffer. Companies\nwith a paper-based expense process had experienced higher levels of misuse of\ncompany expenses by employees with 91% saying that they had experienced issues\nonce or more over the last 12 months, compared to 84% of companies with\nautomated processes.\n\n> _\u201cAs our research shows, automating expense management is unlikely to\n> eliminate fraud and misuse completely, but it does shine a torch on it at an\n> earlier stage. At Caxton, we have been developing our technology based on\n> our clients need for control and oversight for the last 17 years.

Lots of factors can lead to feelings of anxiety and pressure in\nthe workplace like a micromanaging boss, unhealthy office culture, and\nunrealistic demands from the company.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/happy.jpg)\n\nMoreover, even though many people are looking for a less stressful work\nenvironment, they don\u2019t have the liberty of giving up their high-paying yet\ntaxing jobs because of their responsibilities at home. As a result, they must\ncontinue to suffer through these hardships at the cost of their health.\n\nIf you feel that it\u2019s time for a career change, here are some essential tips\non choosing a low-stress job:\n\n**1\\. Identify Your Stressors**\n\nEveryone is unique. What\u2019s stressful for an individual may be considered an\nenjoyable challenge for another person. You have to determine what stresses\nyou out first before you can find a job that enables you to become better\nprofessionally without pushing yourself too far.\n\nThese are the typical workplace stressors that you should think about:\n\n  * **Heavy workload** \u2013 Depending on your circumstances, you may thrive on having a lot of responsibilities, or you may feel overused to the point of exhaustion. If you think that your role stretches you too thin without appropriate compensation, consider [choosing low-stress jobs that really pay well](https://crowdworknews.com/low-stress-jobs-that-pay-well/), such as blogging and illustrating.\n\n  * **Demands** \u2013 Some bosses set very high standards for their subordinates to follow, and some employees are competitive enough to surpass those expectations. However, not many people can keep up with such demands, especially when they\u2019re bordering on the unrealistic.\n\n  * **Job Ambiguity** \u2013 Changes in management or job descriptions can cause feelings of anxiety for workers. If your organization is going through this period of uncertainty, it\u2019s your right to ask your supervisor on where you stand. With this, you save yourself from having to worry about your place in the company.\n\n  * **No Recognition** \u2013 A majority of employees thrive in workplaces that appreciate their contributions to the company. A simple gesture such as a pat on the back or a thank-you note can go a long way in making workers feel that their roles are essential to the organization. If you feel undervalued in your workplace, maybe it\u2019s time for a change in environment. \n\n**2\\. Take Time for Personality Introspection**\n\nYour personality and career should complement each other. Extroverts will grow\nbored in desk jobs where they have to face a computer for eight hours or more.\nConversely, introverts will also be drained of energy if they\u2019re forced to\ninteract with people all day long.\n\nTo find a job that isn\u2019t stressful for you, you should dig deep into yourself\nand find out what personality type you have. Introverts thrive in the IT\nindustry and other science fields, along with museum work and even animal\ncare, where they only have to deal with cute, furry creatures. Moreover,\nintroverts are also likely to enjoy creative work such as designing and\nwriting.\n\nExtroverts could look for jobs in human resources, public relations, and\nsales, where they can feed off of the energy of other people. If you\u2019re more\nof the organized type, a career in administration and finance will suit you\nwell.\n\n**3\\. Track Your Accomplishments**\n\nTo prepare yourself for this major career move, you should take note of the\nmilestones that you\u2019ve achieved in your past and current jobs. Doing so will\nnot only help you review your contributions to the organization you\u2019ve been\nwith, but also enable you to find your strengths.\n\nThis information can help you decide what types of jobs are ideal for your\npersonality as well as skills and experience. Having the appropriate knowledge\nfor a role can significantly lessen the stress you experience on the job.\n\n**4\\. Find Your Niche**\n\nOften, the most specific roles are the least demanding because your scope of\nwork is narrowed down to a few key tasks and responsibilities. According to\nLifehack, glass blowers have one of the least stressful jobs in the world\nalong with solar energy systems engineers, mapping technicians, and massage\ntherapists.\n\nThese professions not only provide you with a challenging yet fulfilling work\nenvironment, but they also pay well. While compensation plays a significant\nrole in making a career more enticing, other factors like job satisfaction and\nopportunities for growth also influence this aspect as well.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nEveryone wants a low-stress job. However, you should remember that what may be\nstressful for a person may not be anxiety-inducing for another. Identifying\nyour stressors and taking the time for introspection can significantly aid\nyour quest to find the ideal career path for you.\n\nNext, you must track your accomplishments to discover your strengths.

the\nbenefits of hiring staff members that have had the opportunity to learn and\nunderstand new cultures - especially from a business perspective,are\nplentiful.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/plane-1.png)\n\nBusinesses that look to higher employees with transnational experience will\noften do so because they want to tap into specific skills sets that can be\ntransferred into the workplace.\n\nWhether it\u2019s the ability to dedicate time to learning a new language, dealing\nwith customers who possess opposing cultural views, or feeling comfortable\noperating in an environment that differs to the status quo - these skill sets\nare highly beneficial to an employer.  \n\nThis is especially true for employers that are looking to take on graduate\ncandidates that have had international exposure. This viewpoint was supported\nin a 2017-published study by QS Global Employer, which found that 6 out of 10\nbusinesses would give a graduate candidate extra credit for exposing\nthemselves to a foreign market.\n\nThis appetite to gain international experience was highlighted in a recent\nPwCreport, which estimates that the number of transnational postings will\nincrease by 50% in the next decade.\n\nPersonal growth  \nAlthough somewhat of a cliche, the processing of 'finding oneself' on foreigns\noil can allow employees to assess their underlying strengths and weaknesses.In\nterms of personal growth, an international placement can also give employees\nthe opportunity to evaluate their long-term goals and ambitions, and thus,\nhave a clear route of progression in mind.\n\n  \nThis is highly beneficial from a human resource perspective, as employers can\nensure they are hiring someone has their specific career path mapped out. On\nthe contrary, hiring somebody without a clear career route in mind is likely\nto result in the employee looking elsewhere once they realise the role isn\u2019t\nfor them.\n\n**Graduates thatstudied abroad also offer value**  \nWhile international experience in a real-world business setting is desired,\nemployers are also keen to take on workers that chose to study abroad. Whether\nit's Amsterdam, Lausanne, Paris or Zurich - student placements in [cultural\ncities](https://oxfordsummercourses.com/articles/most-cultural-student-\ncities/) offers businesses a number of key benefits.\n\n  \nNot only does it demonstrate that the individual was willing to live in a new\nculture and spend the required time to learn a language, but it also\nillustrates that they are capable to succeed in an environment that falls\noutside of their natural comfort zone.\n\n  \nThese highly transferrable skills are something that would benefit businesses\ntremendously in a globalized world that is getting smaller.\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nbenefits-of-hiring-candidates-with-international-\nexperience%2F&linkname=The%20benefits%20of%20hiring%20candidates%20with%20international%20experience\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nbenefits-of-hiring-candidates-with-international-\nexperience%2F&linkname=The%20benefits%20of%20hiring%20candidates%20with%20international%20experience\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nbenefits-of-hiring-candidates-with-international-\nexperience%2F&linkname=The%20benefits%20of%20hiring%20candidates%20with%20international%20experience\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nbenefits-of-hiring-candidates-with-international-\nexperience%2F&linkname=The%20benefits%20of%20hiring%20candidates%20with%20international%20experience\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fthe-\nbenefits-of-hiring-candidates-with-international-\nexperience%2F&linkname=The%20benefits%20of%20hiring%20candidates%20with%20international%20experience\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/the-benefits-of-hiring-candidates-with-international-experience/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/the-benefits-of-hiring-candidates-with-international-experience/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/plane-1-150x150.png&p\\[title\\]=The benefits of hiring candidates with international experience)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/the-benefits-of-hiring-candidates-with-international-experience/&text=The benefits of hiring candidates with international experience)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

A third of firms surveyed (31%)\nestimated the cost per candidate ghosting them to be somewhere between \u00a32000\nand \u00a35000.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cv.jpg)\n\nThe survey \u2013 _Ghosting: The New Recruitment Trend_ , is based on the responses\nfrom 100 HR professionals and management level staff-members who regularly\nconduct interviews. The survey collected responses on \u2018ghosting\u2019 in the\nrecruitment process, and during employment, whereby employees fail to return\nto work without any formal resignation or explanation.\n\n**David Greenhalgh, Employment Partner at Joelson says:**\n\n> \u201dGhosting has become endemic for employers, costing businesses precious time\n> and money. While there is no legal protection against ghosting, employers\n> can attempt to limit risk by taking steps to screen candidates more\n> thoroughly throughout the process, keep in touch more frequently between\n> interviews, and use candidates\u2019 stated preferred method of contact, such as\n> WhatsApp rather than email. The high costs of ghosting means it is essential\n> for businesses to do all they can to protect themselves against it.\u201d  \n\n**Other significant findings of the research include** :\n\n  * 62% of respondents tried two or three times to contact applicants after they had gone silent \n  * 62% had experienced an employee failing to arrive on their first day of work despite having signed a contract \n  * 60% of respondents do not believe that candidate ghosting is a millennial trait \n  * 52% of companies have been ghosted by employees who just didn\u2019t return to work without offering any resignation or explanation as to why they had left \n\n**Greenhalgh continues:**\n\n> \u201cQuite apart from the laws of common decency, ghosting by existing employees\n> is particularly difficult for employers to deal with, as all avenues must be\n> explored before they can officially consider the employee to have terminated\n> their employment, in order to avoid the risk of possible claims.\u201d\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F4-5-of-\nemployers-have-been-ghosted-by-potential-\nrecruits%2F&linkname=4%2F5%20of%20employers%20have%20been%20%E2%80%98ghosted%E2%80%99%20by%20potential%20recruits\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F4-5-of-\nemployers-have-been-ghosted-by-potential-\nrecruits%2F&linkname=4%2F5%20of%20employers%20have%20been%20%E2%80%98ghosted%E2%80%99%20by%20potential%20recruits\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F4-5-of-\nemployers-have-been-ghosted-by-potential-\nrecruits%2F&linkname=4%2F5%20of%20employers%20have%20been%20%E2%80%98ghosted%E2%80%99%20by%20potential%20recruits\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F4-5-of-\nemployers-have-been-ghosted-by-potential-\nrecruits%2F&linkname=4%2F5%20of%20employers%20have%20been%20%E2%80%98ghosted%E2%80%99%20by%20potential%20recruits\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2F4-5-of-\nemployers-have-been-ghosted-by-potential-\nrecruits%2F&linkname=4%2F5%20of%20employers%20have%20been%20%E2%80%98ghosted%E2%80%99%20by%20potential%20recruits\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/4-5-of-employers-have-been-ghosted-by-potential-recruits/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/4-5-of-employers-have-been-ghosted-by-potential-recruits/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/cv-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=4/5 of employers have been \u2018ghosted\u2019 by potential recruits)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/4-5-of-employers-have-been-ghosted-by-potential-recruits/&text=4/5 of employers have been \u2018ghosted\u2019 by potential recruits)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

which one is right for you?_\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/home.jpg)\n\nIt may seem like a great idea - rolling out of bed in your pyjamas and\nswitching on your laptop while you wait for the kettle to boil for your\nmorning cuppa.\n\nAnd while working from home offers an ideal solution for many, some\nprofessionals soon discover it isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be - and that is\none of the reasons why the number of shared office spaces is on the rise.\n\nAccording to a 2017 survey of more than 15,000 working adults, 43% of them\nsaid they spent at least some time in the previous year working remotely, with\n31% saying they worked from home four to five days each week. But 81% of these\nworkers admit there are downsides to working remotely.\n\nThis got us thinking - what is the true cost of working from home and is it\nreally worth it?\n\n**Working from home - the good and the bad\u2026**\n\nBeing home-based can be great as it provides workers with flexibility.\nHowever, it can also be more costly than you think and can actually end up\neating into your very valuable time.\n\nThere are two types of homeworker - the **sole trader** who chooses their home\nas their base and the **employee** who is allowed to work from home from time\nto time.\n\n**Independence, self-discipline and distractions**\n\nWorking from home allows you to be completely independent and you can\npotentially get more work done as you aren't spending your time commuting.\n\nBut it also relies hugely on self-motivation and self-discipline and, if you\nare easily distracted, you could find yourself getting a lot less done in\nthose eight hours - losing you time and money.\n\nBeing surrounded by your home comforts can make you feel a bit too relaxed and\nless motivated too. Those afternoon naps may be too tempting to refuse, or you\nmay get caught up in home administration, watching television and doing\nhousehold chores instead.\n\n**Investments, equipment and usage costs**\n\nIf you don't already own the right equipment, you will need to invest in\nsuitable technology, which could be costly. And, as you will be at home, you\nwill be using more water, gas and electricity than normal.\n\nUnless you have a spare room in your home which can be turned into an office,\nyou will probably work from the sofa or dining room table.\n\nWhile this may be great for a while, you need to think about the long-term\neffects, as your back needs to be properly supported. Therefore, if you plan\non working from home, it will be a good idea to have a designated workspace,\ncomplete with a desk and office chair.\n\n**Working from home - the essentials**\n\nWe\u2019ve put together a list of all of the things you will need if you\u2019re going\nto take the plunge and work from home (these are all approximate costs):\n\n**Computer or laptop (\u00a3500 - \u00a31,200) -** Your profession will depend on the\ncost - the more technical your job, the more expensive your equipment will be.\n\n**Monitor (\u00a3120)** - Again, this will depend on the type of job - if you work\nacross multiple projects, it will be a good idea to invest in a second\ncomputer monitor.\n\n**High-speed internet (\u00a325 per month / \u00a3300 per year)** - It\u2019s a must -\nespecially when working to client deadlines.\n\n**Desk or workstation (\u00a3150)** - You will need a designated workspace with\nenough space for all of your equipment.\n\n**Office chair (\u00a3100) -** As you will be spending a great deal of your day\nsitting down, it is important to get a chair that will provide comfort and\nsupport.\n\n**Telephone/work mobile (\u00a340 per month / \u00a3480 per year)**  - Essential if your\nwork consists of speaking over the phone with colleagues and/or clients.\n\n**IT software (minimum \u00a39.40 per month / \u00a3112.80 per year) - **The level of IT\nsoftware you require will depend on your job, however there are certain pieces\nof software that are essential.\n\n**Printer (\u00a360)** - All business owners and workers will need to use a printer\nat some point, so it is important to have one at hand.\n\n**Filing cabinet and storage (\u00a3100)** **  -** It is vital that you keep all\npaperwork and documents safe and locked away in a filing cabinet to prevent\nthem getting lost or damaged.\n\n**_Estimated total cost = \u00a31,922.80_**\n\nCosts will vary depending on your occupation and the equipment you require;\nhowever it is worth noting that the initial costs can be very expensive.\n\n**Productivity and working too much**\n\nIt may seem strange, as there are so many potential distractions when working\nfrom home but there is a danger of it becoming a bit of a strain.\n\nBecause you\u2019ll have a quieter environment and be avoiding the occasional\ndisruptions of working in an office, you may lose track of time and end up\nworking too much, clocking up too many hours, risking your work life blurring\ninto your home life.\n\nThis may leave you feeling as if you are always at work, causing you to feel\ndeflated, burnt out and as though there is no separation between working and\nenjoying being at home.\n\n**Lack of communication, networking and business opportunities**\n\nWorking from home can be rather lonely, with no physical human interaction or\ncommunication. As you will be working individually a lot of the time, it can\nalso lead to less networking opportunities for your business.\n\nYou might become to feel out of the loop with the industry you work in. It is\nhard to replicate the casual, spur-of-the-moment collaborations and\nbrainstorming sessions with colleagues which can have such a positive effect\non your attitude towards working.\n\n**Co-working spaces: A modern alternative**\n\nAlthough you may get the occasional interruptions from co-workers, working in\na serviced, [co-working office\nspace](https://www.searchofficespace.com/blog/20-of-the-best-coworking-spaces-\nin-london/) can be extremely advantageous.\n\n**Routine and structure**\n\nWorking from home may sound perfect, however it lacks one of the most\nimportant things that sole traders and employees need - routine and structure.\n\nAlthough people think they can be self-motivated and disciplined, they are\noften not. Flexible co-working spaces are the ideal environment and provide\nthe perfect mixture of independence, self-discipline and routine.\n\nHaving a co-working space to go to means that you will arrive at a certain\ntime and leave eight hours later. Working too many hours in the day can have a\nnegative impact on your performance - having a designated place to work can\nboost productivity and motivation.\n\n**Feeling productive and motivated**\n\nFirst of you all, you will be dressed in your working business attire which\nimmediately makes you feel more motivated and ready to take on the day.\nWhereas if you worked from home, you may be tempted to stay in loungewear,\nleaving you feeling sluggish.\n\nWorking in a shared office space also means you\u2019ll be surrounded by other\nmotivated and productive professionals - this will have a positive impact on\nyou and your work.\n\n**Costs and saving money**\n\nWorking in a shared office space may seem more expensive but it could actually\nsave you money.\n\nAll the equipment, technology, bills and maintenance are included in your\nmonthly rental charge, meaning there will be no surprise charges at the end of\neach month. You are supplied with everything you need without having to go out\nand buy it yourself.\n\n**Access to professional work space**\n\nYou will have access to meeting rooms, desks and office space that you\nwouldn't normally have.

In addition, their\nautumn survey has explored employer attitudes towards business planning around\nBrexit, organisations\u2019 approaches to managing mental health and wellbeing in\nthe workplace, and current activity around setting competitive benefits\npackages.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/paydata.jpg)\n\n138 HR Directors, Finance Directors and Reward/Compensation Specialists\nprovided their insights into practices affecting around 380,000 employees.\n\nHere Paydata\u2019s Director Tim Kellett outlines the five key developments\naffecting reward professionals in the UK.\n\n  1. **Business optimism wavers as Brexit remains an unknown**\n\nPolitical turbulence persists, with another general election scheduled before\nChristmas and the campaign trail in full swing. This has postponed a potential\n\u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit and we note the effect this uncertainty is having on\nbusinesses and the impact on their operations. Only half of organisations have\na plan in place to protect the business or identify potential opportunities,\nwhilst only six to eight per cent of businesses see Brexit as an opportunity\non any timescale.\n\nWhilst business optimism had remained steady with 57 per cent of respondents\nexpecting revenues to increase in spring 2019, consistent with projections for\nthe last three years, our autumn survey has captured a notable decline in\nbusiness confidence to 31 per cent expecting increased revenues.\n\n  * **Pay awards and out of cycle awards remain steady**\n\nUp to three per cent pay increases remain most popular amongst respondents,\nsustaining wage growth as it tracks just above inflation. The two most quoted\ndrivers for pay increases are external relativities and targeting high\nperforming individuals \u2013 putting a firm focus on recruiting and retaining the\nright talent through competitive reward packages. Loyalty no longer translates\nto automatically higher pay, with two thirds of organisations having to offer\nnew recruits salaries that conflict with those paid to existing employees.\n\nWe continue to monitor the role of out of cycle pay increases, as 75 per cent\ncite market pressures as a key driving force behind their use. These types of\nincreases supplement steady pay awards as they bridge the gap between official\npay review figures and wider market pressures, most commonly accounting for up\nto one per cent of annual pay bills.\n\n  * **Recruitment challenges are acute for employers**\n\nOver half of respondents (55 per cent) have experienced difficulty in\nretaining people and anticipate ongoing retention difficulties. However, more\nrespondents revealed difficulties with recruiting people over the past 12\nmonths, with 66 per cent facing challenges. 60 per cent also anticipate\ndifficulties in recruiting over the next 12 months.\n\nOrganisations believe that Brexit will have the biggest impact on skills and\nlabour shortages, with 33 per cent saying investment in this area will be\nincreased as a result of Brexit and 36 per cent saying it is too early to\ntell. This is in contrast to half of organisations saying that investment in\nother HR/Reward operations (pay review funding, project budgets and the\nemployment of young people) will remain the same.\n\n  * **Employee benefits increasingly reflect employee values**\n\n66 per cent have reviewed their benefits offering in 2019 and 82 per cent\nexpect to in 2020, demonstrating how keen organisations are to ensure they are\noffering competitive benefits packages that reflect value in employees\u2019 eyes \u2013\na key recruitment and retention tool. The top three reported benefits are:\n\n  1. Pension scheme (97 per cent)\n  2. Life assurance (89 per cent)\n  3. Employee assistance programme (86 per cent)\n\nThe fact that pensions consistently feature as the number one benefit is not\nsurprising in itself, as the government has put the onus onto the employer to\noffer every employee access to a pension scheme through auto enrolment. This\nmeans the decision regarding pensions comes down to how much the employer\nshould contribute. Employers should ensure that employees know their options\nand the long-term value of the benefit. More creative benefits consistently\nfeature that relate to employee health and wellbeing. 70 per cent offer bike\nto work schemes, 42 per cent offer gym memberships and 57 per cent offer\nhealth check-ups, showing that many businesses are looking to support health\nand wellbeing. This illustrates the different approaches organisations take\nwhen it comes to defining wellbeing in the workplace.\n\n  * **The role of the employer in employee mental health and wellbeing**\n\nOverwhelmingly, employers are recognising their responsibility to support\nemployees with their wider wellbeing and specifically, their mental health. 83\nper cent of respondents have policies and procedures in place to specifically\nsupport mental health and wellbeing in the workplace. Just as employee\nassistance programmes feature in the top benefits reported by companies, this\nis also the top mental health and wellbeing initiative in the workplace. This\nis followed by 92 per cent providing flexible working and 86 per cent offering\naccess to counselling services. It is important to note the opportunity for\nmental health and wellbeing initiatives to work hand in hand and effect long-\nterm cultural awareness and change.\n\nRespondents reported workplace stigma and perceptions as the top challenge to\nmanaging mental health and wellbeing. Furthermore, return on investment was\nfrequently cited as a barrier to overcome when requesting resource in this\narea; however, 82 per cent cited a lack of clarity over how to measure success\nas a challenge. When asked if respondents had a dedicated budget for mental\nhealth and wellbeing programmes in their business, 55 per cent said no. When\nit comes to implementing employee mental health initiatives, employers cited\nthe biggest pressures as time, cost and resources. Communication and awareness\nis crucial in managing the successful support of individuals who need to know\nthat help is available.\n\n**Have your say**\n\nAt Paydata we ensure employers offer competitive salary and benefits packages,\nbenchmarking competitors and the wider market.

With so many\nchanges happening within our workplaces, it is therefore increasingly\nimportant to consider how employees are managed and developed. Some factors\nare more obvious, such as influences from changing technology, organisations\nneed to ensure that employees are equipped with the right skills so that they\nare aligned with the organisation\u2019s aspirations. This is so that they can gain\na competitive edge in their industries and achieve success in their respective\nmarkets.\n\nA large part of this success and having that competitive edge can be\nattributed to the culture of the organisation which is one of the reasons why\nthe topic is now in the spotlight. Creating a positive culture is no longer\nabout free fruit Tuesdays, the annual pay increase or the Christmas bonus,\nwhilst they may be lovely gestures, they are simply not enough to hold the\nlevels of engagement expected by organisations, nor is it proven to achieve\nemployee loyalty. As the world of work has changed and as different\ngenerations are now working together, employees are all driven by different\nthings and the desirable elements that employees seek when selecting an\nemployer are flexibility, meaningful work and autonomy, creating a sense of\nbalance within their daily lives.\n\nAnother workplace fad?\n\nIt is easy to view organisational culture as a fad, but having regular\nconversations about conflict at work with my clients, I can say first hand\nthat I do not believe that it is a fad and can be backed up with evidence.\nRecently, Robert Half conducted a survey and established that a third of\njobseekers would reject their dream job if the organisational culture was a\nnegative one.\n\nThe role of HR\n\nHR are often seen as the drivers behind workplace cultures, but it is in fact\neveryone\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the working environment is a happier\nplace to be. One of the strongest engagement tools that can be used is the\norganisations line managers, they know their people better than anyone and\nthey are then enabled to not only manage their employees effectively, but they\nare in a position where they can win hearts and minds. Additionally, they can\nprovide a view to senior management in order to obtain support and put\nemployee wellbeing as a priority. It is important to keep in mind that this\ndoesn\u2019t happen overnight, it takes a great deal of trust from senior\nmanagement and from the employees, so the people in the middle need to be able\nto use their knowledge and skills to influence at both sides. It takes\nconsistent effort and investment, which is sadly not often seen a business\npriority, but if these elements are in place, this can help to create a\npositive working environment for everybody.\n\nTrust\n\nLet\u2019s face it, the fundamentals of any employment relationship are based upon\ntrust. Trust is also a confident relationship with the unknown, it enables us\nto feel comfortable with the unfamiliar. Being vulnerable is at the heart of\ntrust and that is why it is incredibly damaging and hurtful when it breaks\ndown.\n\nOver the next few years, we will certainly experience significant changes as\nwe embrace new ways of working, without trust, this can potentially create a\ntoxic culture within which energy that could be spent on productivity is\nactually spent on office politics and negative behaviours, which results in\nwasted time, money and energy which could be better spent elsewhere.\n\nAuthenticity\n\nThe authenticity of business leaders, accountability, ethical working\npractices, empowerment, fair management all have an important part to play in\npromoting a positive organisational culture. By creating an environment within\nwhich employees feel empowered and working with purpose increases productivity\nand gets employees working to their full potential. Additionally, it isn\u2019t a\nsecret that a key to attracting and retaining the best talent is by giving\nemployees purpose and making them feel valued. By being transparent and\nstarting with small actions, this can be a great starting point to creating a\npositive culture.\n\nOne size does NOT fit all!\n\nThere is no one size fits all when it comes to effective leadership, however,\nthere are many ways to encourage a positive culture through the workplace. By\nbeing open minded, line managers can identify the expectations and needs of\nemployees, they can then tailor their approach to their employees. If managers\nare responsive to the changing environments and combine this with a flexible\napproach, this can enable effective management of negative behaviours quickly\nand establish new ways of working. Again, trust has an important part to play\nas the new ways of working are established, this may include delegation of\ntasks which many people are generally uncomfortable with.\n\nDevelopment\n\nManagement and leadership skills are difficult to find and should never be\ntaken for granted, training and ongoing support through initiatives such as\nmentoring enable managers to become successful leaders. If organisations fail\nto support managers appropriately, they risk setting them up for a fall\nespecially in cases of promotion, the employee may be great at what they do,\nbut are they then promoted for that fact into a role beyond the scope of their\ncapability?

This\nstress damages employee motivation and productivity, as well as \u2013 by extension\n\u2013 business output and the customer experience.\n\n![](http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/money2.jpg)\n\nPoor financial wellbeing is a result of a toxic combination of an\nunderperforming economy, slowing wage growth, peak levels of household debt,\nstagnant savings habits, and \u2013 of course \u2013 low levels of financial literacy.\n\nThere\u2019s a misconception that the employer\u2019s main role in this situation should\nbe to help alleviate the consequences of poor financial wellbeing, like debt,\nrather than address the root causes.\n\nBut our own survey of UK employees indicates that a more beneficial approach\nto supporting financial wellbeing is to start with the basics: using education\nto build financial literacy, especially as it relates to the all-important\ndetails found on the traditional payslip.\n\n**Understanding the awareness gap**\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at some of our findings.\n\nWe found that less than half (44%) of UK employees are offered financial\nliteracy education. At face value this might not be too surprising; after all,\nmost people don\u2019t view money and personal finance as traditional topics of\ndiscussion within the workplace.\n\nHowever, if we take the viewpoint that pay and reward is in fact the central\ntransaction between an employer and its employees, it\u2019s easier to see a\nlogical role for organisations to support their staff in improving their\nfinancial literacy. It\u2019s a key example of making those employees feel valued\nand rewarded for the work that they do, beyond just processing the payroll.\n\nIt\u2019s also a crucial way to build trust, especially with faith in banks and\ntraditional financial institutions starting to diminish. At the same time,\nthere is a clear line to be drawn between employer-led financial literacy\ninitiatives and providing access to regulated financial advice \u2013 the latter\nbeing something which businesses should steer well clear of.\n\nJudging by our research, there\u2019s a clear need to explain how fundamental\nconcepts such as tax, benefits and pension contributions, actually work. The\nmajority (58%) of employees admit that they don\u2019t fully understand their\npayslips, while only a quarter (24%) check their statement every month.\n\nThis lack of awareness extends to benefits, with nearly a third (32%) saying\nthey don\u2019t have enough information about the choices available to them, as\nwell as pensions, with a quarter saying they aren\u2019t clear on their different\noptions.\n\nIn support of this, the CIPD also found that less than a quarter (24%) of HR\nprofessionals think their employees have the knowledge to make the right\nreward and benefit choices to meet their financial needs. As a result, they\ncan\u2019t take full advantage of the attractive employment packages that many\norganisations offer today.\n\nSo employers must do more to close this information gap. Employees indicate\nthat this would have a positive impact both on their wellbeing and their\nrelationship with their organisation:\n\n  * 63% said they would feel more looked after \n  * 33% said they would be more loyal \n  * 31% said they would feel less stressed about money issues\n\nBut what steps can employers take to make this happen?\n\n**Develop financial education programmes:** One of the most straightforward\nmethods would be to develop financial education programmes. These can be\nmanaged by an internal expert or an external provider. The content of these\nprogrammes should cater to a range of ages and experiences, covering\neverything from how to understand a basic payslip and how to use certain\nbenefits, to the complexities of the tax system and how different pension\noptions work.\n\nOne might also consider it to be a responsibility of the organisation to\ninform employees of their eligibility to receive certain state benefits.\nHundreds of thousands of low-wage employees don\u2019t claim benefits they are\nentitled to do today \u2013 and these are the people who end up in-work, but\nsuffering severe financial stress. Correcting this could make a significant\ndifference to wellbeing, especially for workers in low wage jobs that may not\nbe aware they are entitled to receive Universal Credit, for example.\n\n**Engage employees with benefit choices:** The benefits package on offer plays\na huge part in differentiating an organisation in the eyes of employees,\nimpacting on both talent acquisition and retention. However, encouraging\nuptake of benefits can be a struggle and organisations sometimes find that\nthis area of HR investment doesn\u2019t generate the return they were hoping for.\n\nThis may be put down to three main reasons:\n\n  1. A lack of awareness of what benefits are available\n  2. A lack of knowledge about how to use the benefits\n  3. A lack of relevant and useful benefits. \n\nAll of the reasons point to a clear solution, which is to engage with\nemployees throughout the process of designing a benefits strategy. Gathering\nfeedback directly from employees improves the organisation\u2019s understanding of\nwhich benefits are the most useful and relevant. At the same time it helps\nbuild benefits awareness and knowledge for employees \u2013 something which can\nalso be achieved by providing a \u2018total rewards statement\u2019 as part of, or\nalongside, the traditional payslip.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t forget that base pay remains one of, if not the most important\nreasons for an individual to join an organisation. But once pay rates are\ndeemed to be satisfying and fair, employers must focus on communicating the\nintangible elements of the employment package in order to boost recruitment,\nretention and productivity.\n\n**Improve access to HR systems:** A crucial part of improving financial\nawareness and wellbeing in the workplace is making sure employees have hassle-\nfree access to information held in HR systems, especially with the increased\nuse of \u2018self-service\u2019. All too often employees have to contend with multiple\nlogins across multiple different platforms, which can be frustrating and may\nput them off trying even the simplest of activities, such as checking their\npayslip and pension contributions.\n\nSimilar problems can occur if the user interface is outdated and clunky, or if\nthe systems can\u2019t be easily accessed on mobile devices. Remember that modern\nemployees typically conduct a lot of life-admin, such as updating their bank\ndetails, outside of work and on-the-go.\n\nPrioritising investment in HR systems that meet the expectations of today\u2019s\nworkforce for agile, easy to use, consumer-grade technology is essential. It\nhelps employees feel more aware and in control of their pay and rewards, and \u2013\nas a result \u2013 more secure in their financial situation.\n\nIn 2020, worrying about money will be more stressful to employees than their\nwork or relationships. Our research shows the hugely positive impact improving\nfinancial literacy at work can have for all involved.

Should a female be\ntreated differently to a male in similar circumstances, then she may have a\nclaim and this could prove costly for your business as our article on the\n[cost of discrimination highlights](https://www.hr-24.co.uk/articles/can-you-\nafford-the-cost-of-workplace-discrimination-claim/). Employers should deal\nsensitively and even-handedly with both partners in these circumstances and\nour expert HR consultants are on hand to advise you on dealing with such\nmatters.\n\nOf further concern is the balance that must be struck by an employer in\ndealing with personal relationships in work, whilst allowing the employee\ntheir right to a private life as is afforded under Article 8 of the European\nCharter on Human Rights: Right to respect for private and family life. An\noutright ban on romantic involvement at work is likely to be considered\ndisproportionate, however, a requirement that staff are to disclose\nrelationships, in order that the employer may take steps to avoid any\nconflicts of interest, may be considered proportionate.\n\nIn many cases, a personal relationship between staff will not interfere with\nwork and it is important that staff are respected to conduct themselves\nprofessionally. There should be mutual trust and confidence in the employment\nrelationship; should an employer fundamentally breach this implied term; they\nmay face a claim of constructive unfair dismissal.\n\nHowever, personal relationships at work have the potential to be a serious\nmanagement concern and a policy to address the matter is advisable. The\nfollowing issues may be of serious management concern:\n\n  * Legal risks regarding discrimination and harassment\n  * Risk to the confidentiality of business information\n  * Actual or perceived bias in recruitment/promotion/appraisals/discipline, especially when staff in a personal relationship are directly reporting to or subordinate to the other\n  * Adverse impacts on team dynamics and team morale\n\nOf considerable concern will be subordinate personal relationships in the\nworkplace and an employer may wish to include, as a matter of policy, that\nstaff must inform HR of such relationships should they arise. Some employers\nmay decide to agree a plan with the couple\n\nto minimise the impact of the personal relationship on the business. This is\nlikely to involve one or both of the partners transferring where possible or\nremoving the responsibility of the manager in certain circumstances. However,\neach case must be dealt with on the facts and there are considerable risks in\nmaking such changes. As such, it is important that you seek specialist advice\non the issue.\n\nIf you have any concerns or would like free advice on this topic or any\nemployment law matter, please call 0800 015 2519 or register for free access\nto [HR24 Dashboard](https://www.hr-24.co.uk/register/).\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Frelationships-\nin-the-workplace%2F&linkname=Relationships%20in%20the%20Workplace\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Frelationships-\nin-the-workplace%2F&linkname=Relationships%20in%20the%20Workplace\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Frelationships-\nin-the-workplace%2F&linkname=Relationships%20in%20the%20Workplace\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Frelationships-\nin-the-workplace%2F&linkname=Relationships%20in%20the%20Workplace\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Frelationships-\nin-the-workplace%2F&linkname=Relationships%20in%20the%20Workplace\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/relationships-in-the-workplace/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/relationships-in-the-workplace/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/couple-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=Relationships in the Workplace)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/relationships-in-the-workplace/&text=Relationships in the Workplace)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.
