Can organisational\ncultures of Chinese companies attract, motivate and retain world-leading\ntalent? Glassdoor.com\u2019s rating of \u2018Refer a Friend\u2019 is an excellent measure of\nengagement within global companies.\n\nAccording to Glassdoor\u2019s ratings, of all Asian global companies, only Toyota\nmight be considered an Employer of Choice in countries throughout the world.\nWhy have so many Asian companies failed?\n\nAs an American, I have served on international assignments for two American\ncompanies, AT&T Japan and IBM Asia Pacific. I have also been a headquarters\nexecutive for two non-US companies, ABN AMRO Bank in Amsterdam and Huawei in\nShenzhen. Talent Management leaders may checkbox these equally as\n\u2018international assignments\u2019 but, in reality, the experiences were dramatically\ndifferent. The differences were caused by workplace culture.\n\n> I have been a headquarters executive for two non-US companies, ABN AMRO Bank\n> in Amsterdam and Huawei in Shenzhen.\n\nOrganisation cultures of most American corporations are founded on American\nvalues such as equality, individualism, and personal freedom. Americans\nbelieve these are universal human values and that they will be accepted by\npeople throughout the world. That may be true. More people choose to immigrate\nto America than to any other country \u2013 by far. Additionally, according to\nLinkedIn, American companies represent 21 of the 25 \u201cMost Attractive Employers\non Earth.\u201d\n\nAsians who work in American companies often say they have been \u201cAmericanised.\u201d\nMany struggle when joining an Asian company. But, who has heard of an American\nwho has worked for a Japanese company as being \u201cJapanised?\u201d Maybe American\nvalues truly are universal.\n\nI have worked as an OD consultant at PepsiCo, McDonald\u2019s, AT&T, and IBM. Many\nAmericans might say that these cultures are very different, but they really\nare not. What is the difference between AT&T and IBM cultures? I could not\nperceive a difference.The reason is that American corporate HR practices and\nleadership expectations are aligned to American values. For example, if \u2018all\nhumans are equal\u2019, then HR methods and leadership competencies at PepsiCo and\nMcDonalds will be similarly designed to support that value. And those\npractices will be consistent in every country in the world. This was true also\nat IBM where HR policies and leadership practices are the same in every\ncountry. Thus, the organisational culture of IBM China and IBM India are the\nsame as IBM US.\n\n> Over my nine years at Huawei, I watched the culture change. Every year,\n> central committees of leaders delegated more and more decisions and\n> authority to the front line and to business units.\n\nHowever, the cultures at ABN AMRO Bank and Huawei were completely different. I\njoined ABN AMRO as SVP, global talent management. The company searched\nthroughout the Netherlands, then Western Europe, and finally, after two years,\nthey expanded the search to North America and I got the job.\n\nOn my first day, I was invited to attend a large meeting of ABN AMRO HR people\nfrom all over the world. The meeting purpose was to design ABN AMRO\u2019s global\ntalent management strategy. The CHRO said I could listen, but I was not\nallowed to make any comments. \u201cWhat?\u201d I thought. \u201cYou just hired me as your\nglobal talent management leader. These people know nothing about talent\nmanagement. And they are creating the strategy that I must execute?\u201d\n\nI learned that this type of group decision making is deep inside the Germanic\ncultures. That may be acceptable if you are Dutch, but my desire to innovate\nand my American need for individualism could not accept it. So I left.\n\nHuawei was the opposite of ABN AMRO. When I entered Huawei in 2010, the\naverage employee was 28 years old. The senior executives told me Huawei\nmanagers were young and could not be trusted.\n\nEmployees were required to badge in and out. They could not walk outside\noffice buildings during work hours. HRBPs stood next to the cashier at lunch\nlines to make sure employees did not buy lunch before 12 pm.\n\nIn 2010, Huawei\u2019s decision making was strictly top-down. All HR policies,\nprocesses and programs were presented to the Human Resource Committee (HRC) \u2013\nlike a board of directors for HR. The HRC made all decisions. Once made, these\ndecisions were almost impossible to reverse. Getting all committee members to\nagree is difficult. Even if the decision was clearly mistaken or was not\nproducing the intended result, no one dared to go back and reopen the issue.\nMany in HR worked on projects they knew would never work.\n\nSuccessful Huawei HR professionals understood this culture. They followed\ntheir orders. Once, I visited the COO of Huawei University. I said, \u201cI have a\nbreakthrough idea on training!\u201d He stopped me, \u201cIf the CHRO tells me to do it,\nI will do it. If he does not tell me, I won\u2019t do it.\u201d He did not care about\nbusiness success. He did not even want to hear my suggestion. However, his\nbehaviours enabled him to get to the top of Huawei HR.At Huawei, I called this\nEmperor Leadership. Whatever the Emperor said, the employees would do \u2013 no\nquestions asked. Historic Asian leaders used this type of leadership. And some\nmight argue that today\u2019s governments still use it. Throughout my time at\nHuawei, I fought to expose and reduce Emperor Leadership.\n\n> Huawei has succeeded in continually realigning HR systems and leadership\n> practices to strengthen a culture that maximises motivation.\n\nOver my nine years at Huawei, I watched the culture change. Every year,\ncentral committees of leaders delegated more and more decisions and authority\nto the front line and to business units. Finally, the HRC was dissolved and\nbusiness units and countries were allowed to customise their own processes and\npolicies using a centrally designed template. Maybe this was because lower-\nlevel manager capabilities improved. Or maybe, they realised that as Huawei\ngrew it was impossible for HQ executives to make front line decisions. In any\ncase, the executive team continually realigned HR practices to meet\nmarketplace realities. The result was significant culture change.\n\nIn 2017, Huawei conducted the world\u2019s largest study on work values of\n\u2018Millennials in the Workplace\u2019 to assess the alignment between HR policies and\nMillennial motivators. The overall conclusion was that the values of Huawei\u2019s\nChinese Millennials are rapidly merging with Western values.\n\nIn response, Huawei further modified HR and leadership practices to meet these\nchanging demands. Now, Huawei climate survey responses find that Huawei\u2019s\nChinese employee engagement is high and that non-Chinese employee engagement\nremains significantly lower, but is finally improving.\n\nGreat leaders have willing followers. Great organisations create values and HR\npractices that meet employee needs. Huawei has succeeded in continually\nrealigning HR systems and leadership practices to strengthen a culture that\nmaximises motivation. Maintaining that alignment will be a core challenge for\nevery Asian global company.\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

The top HR priorities for the next\ndecade will be to build critical skills, strengthen the leadership bench, and\nimplement organizational design and change management.\n\nWhile CHROs seem to be aware of these [pressing\nchallenges](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/articles/chro-pulse-survey-2019\n\"Research Link\"), research suggests that not many are [entirely confident of\ntackling them head-on](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/pl/pdf/2019/05/pl-\nRaport-KPMG-The-future-of-HR-2019-In-the-Know-or-in-the-No.pdf \"Research\nLink\"). One reason behind this uncertainty is that digital transformation has\nnot just forced organizations to redesign their business models and processes,\nbut also their management practices. The use of next-gen technology in HR has\ndisrupted the [already-evolving\nfunction](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-\ntrends/2017/digital-transformation-in-hr.html \"Research Link\"), giving rise to\nnew challenges and opportunities. To understand these shifts, it would help to\nretrace the role of HR and contextualize the change taking place in the last\ndecade. Here\u2019s a look at how new-age technology and tools have helped\ntransform the core functions of HR:\n\n### The shift to a purpose-based HR\n\nFor the longest time, the core function of HR tools and systems has been to\nmaintain a system of record. HR\u2019s role was only a transactional necessity\nbetween the employee and the employer.\n\nThe proliferation of next-gen tech in HR is helping organizations keep track\nof people\u2019s work, undertake objective performance assessment, measure\nengagement, and support employees in making their work-life easier. This shift\nfrom a process-based to a purpose-based HR has paved the way for organizations\nto manage their employees as people and not just resources.\n\n### Meeting the changing workforce expectations\n\nThe next discernible change in HR has been the realization of how vital it is\nto address people's challenges in a timely fashion. Whether its challenges\npertaining to working remotely or digitizing functional HR activities like\nrecruitment, engagement, and assessment \u2013 all of which have been strengthened\nby the inclusion of employee data, advanced tools and devices have helped\norganizations capture and analyze an employee data. Thus, quarterly, or\nyearly, appraisals have given way to continuous feedback, continuous learning\nand continuous rewards.\n\n### Increased focus on experience\n\nThe transition from process-based to purpose-based HR has been enabled by\nsystems and technologies that are designed around \u2018experiences.\u2019 This has\nresulted in HR systems and tools to become more intuitive, user-friendly, and\nadaptive. One of the biggest consequences of this has been the inclusion of\nmulti-disciplinary experts in the HR function, which, up until a decade ago,\nwould have been difficult to imagine. Today, leading organizations are hiring\nexperts in analytics, artificial intelligence, user interface/experience, and\ndesign thinking to improve workplace experience.\n\nTechnologies like robotics process automation, machine learning, natural\nlanguage processing are being leveraged to develop simple, and seamless HR\nsystems. Similarly, the increasing use of digital tools to measure health and\nwellness has also helped collaborate with mental health experts, fitness\ncoaches, and dieticians. This has made it possible for experts with diverse\nknowledge to build cohesive HR solutions that ensure maximum optimization and\nefficiency.\n\nHR leaders and professionals must work towards aligning the entire HR function\nto ensure that employees can perform to their potential. They need to leverage\nnew technologies to empower and engage employees with systems that can deliver\na smooth workplace experience for a diverse workforce. Finally, they need to\nembrace the fact that being digital does not mean randomly using new\ntechnology and tools, but systematically using them to optimize existing human\ncapital management practices. These changes will not only make the HR function\nmore effective but also redefine its business scope in the organization. While\nthe process involves several experts and stakeholders, HR leaders must lead\nthe process of building systems that are truly adaptive, enhance productivity,\nand are designed for every employee in the organization.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Talent Management](/category/compensation-performance/talent-\nmanagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=talent-management \"Browse more\nin: Talent Management\"), [HR Technology](/category/hr-technology/hr-\ntechnology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hr-technology \"Browse more in:\nHR Technology\"), [#Design Thinking HR](/tag/design-thinking-\nhr?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=design-thinking-hr \"Browse more in:\nDesign Thinking HR\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Manav Seth](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1452578431/authors/manav-\nseth.jpg)](/author/manav-seth)\n\n#### [Manav Seth](/author/manav-seth)\n\nManav Seth is a freelance writer at People Matters.\n\n[NEXT STORY: The role of UI and UX in boosting employee experience\n](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/employee-engagement/the-role-of-ui-and-\nux-in-boosting-employee-experience-24802?page=2 \"Article: The role of UI and\nUX in boosting employee experience &ndash;

So what is the disconnect?\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | March 17, 2020\n\nTopics: [Digital Transformation](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/digital-\ntransformation/) | [Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/hrtechnology/) |\n[Leadership](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/leadership/)\n\n_Tom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/83424484_m.jpg)\n\nInjecting new or updated technology into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover US$5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a US$250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% said the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, said Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner.\n\nTinder said her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe said. In fairness, she noted, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn\u2019t matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder said. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don\u2019t have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d\n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, said that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she said, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille said.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explained.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explained. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he added.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte said, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he said, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears said. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nSears said traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder said, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears said, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook said, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he said. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook said. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook said HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concluded. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Dissecting+the+employer+disconnect+in+HR+technology&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

According to a survey by CB Insights, the HR\ntech market is estimated at $14 billion.\n\nOne of the countries where HR technology is about to change significantly is\nJapan. Japan is the world's third-largest economy by gross domestic product,\nbut its lifetime employment system and seniority system remains strong, and it\ncan be said that Japan has the most old-fashioned human resource management\nprocesses among the developed countries.\n\nHowever, it is gradually changing due to the recent breakthrough of HRtech. In\nJapan, the HRtech market is expected to grow to more than $1 billion by 2023\n(MIC Research Institute). This suggests that Japan has entered a period of\nHRtech market growth. So what kind of change is taking place in human resource\nmanagement in Japan?\n\n## Background: Low Labor Productivity and Aging Society\n\nThe growing demand for the HRtech industry in Japan is due to the unique\nworking environment and labor productivity issues.\n\nJapan is an aging society with a declining birth rate, and the 2018 survey\nshows that per capita labor productivity is the lowest among the seven\ndeveloped countries.\n\nThe reason for low labor productivity is that the company gives a lifetime\nemployment system; once you join a big company, it basically means you will\nnot be fired. There is a culture wherein working hours are more virtue than\nthe outcome.\n\nHowever, the wave of globalization and a significant shortage in the working\npopulation have forced Japan to increase labor productivity. The government is\nalso pushing for work style reforms, and attention is being focused on human\nresource management, which is directly linked to improving productivity.\n\nAlthough the HRtech field is reforming existing inefficient talent management\nin Japan, it has evolved around labor management software rather than talent\nmanagement.\n\nAs a result, the software was only used by human resources departments and\nthere was no software that allowed the top executives of a company to properly\nmanage human resources for driving business.\n\nMeanwhile, many start-ups that solve the above problems appeared. For example,\n[kaonavi Inc.](https://corp.kaonavi.jp/en/), this was the first company in the\nHRtech industry to list on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers and lead the\nindustry. kaonavi employs a system that can centrally manage and visualize all\nkinds of HR data to better manage people for maximizing their performance.\n\nkaonavi has reformed the traditional Japanese-style human resource management\nand has a record to be the leader in Japan for four consecutive years as a HR\nmanagement platform. kaonavi Inc. is a cloud-based software-as-a-service\nprovider. 'Kao' means face in Japanese.\n\nWith matching faces and names as its motto, kaonavi Inc. provides a simple\nsystem that manages human resources with employee portrait pictures arranged\non the screen. It integrates HR data that was difficult to manage with\nexisting systems, and eliminates the inconvenience of the UI. This system has\nbeen introduced mainly by IT companies, retail chains, etc., and is currently\nexpanding to finance, manufacturing and all other business categories.\n\nBy introducing this system, various effects will be produced, such as 'high-\nperformer selection ', 'well-fit allocation ', 'streamlined evaluation\nprocess', 'skill management and people development' and turnover prevention in\nturn.\n\n## Growing demand for human resource management systems in Japan\n\nGlobalization, a declining birth rate and aging population is expanding in\nvarious aspects. Japan has been forced to change traditional practices and has\nto increase labor productivity. kaonavi provides an environment where you can\nrefer to the necessary HR data when needed, and realizes corporate HR\nmanagement that utilizes the individuality and talent of employees. The\ncompany is aiming to become an HR data platform as a hub for various human\nresource management solutions from the core HR database.\n\nIn the future, like Japan's kaonavi, there will be an unprecedented HR\nplatform that responds to the unique working environment of Japan, and the HR\ntech market will fuel with promising technology company.\n\n## Latest on Entrepreneur\n\nCommercial Enquiries\n\nFor all commercial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [sales@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:sales@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nAffiliated Sites\n\n  * [Franchise India](http://www.franchiseindia.com)\n  * [Indian Retailer ](http://www.indianretailer.com/)\n  * [Restaurant India](http://www.franchiseindia.com/restaurant)\n  * [WellnessIndia.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness)\n  * [EducationBiz.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/education)\n  * [LicenseIndia.com](http://www.licenseindia.com)\n\nEditorial Enquiries\n\nFor all editorial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [editor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:editor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nCompany\n\n  * [Advertise](http://entrepreneurindia.com/advertisement/)\n\nProducts\n\n  * [Franchise](/franchise)\n  * [Podcasts](/listen)\n  * [Books](https://bookstore.entrepreneur.com)\n\nContributor Enquiries\n\nFor all contributor enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact\n[contributor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:contributor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nEditions\n\n  * [United States](/us)\n  * [India](/in)\n  * [Asia Pacific](/ap)\n  * [Middle East](/me)\n  * [Europe](/eu)\n  * [Espa\u00f1ol](/es)\n  * [Georgia](/ga)\n  * [South Africa](/sa)\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n[ ![Edition: March\n2020](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x4/600/20200307084422-EntrepreneurMarchCover.jpeg?width=150&quality=15)\n](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n  * [Subscribe](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n[![Entrepreneur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20180405100041-entrepreneur-\nasia-pacific-white.svg)](/)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/EntAsiaPacific\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entrepreneur-media-india\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/entrepreneurmedia\n\"Pinterest\")[__](https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Instagram\")[__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Q3EHcO5kH9oaD4oaMvjw\n\"YouTube\")\n\n[Terms of Use](/terms-of-service) [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) [Cookies\nPolicy](/cookie-policy) [Site Map](/sitemaps/main)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

A product team will work hard to get to know that\ncustomer and how the organization's products and services can be continuously\nimproved to make them more successful. But what if you don't work in product?\nWhat if you work in Human Resources and are in charge of learning and\ndevelopment? What if you work in the legal department and your remit is\ncybersecurity policy for the company? Do you still make a product? Do you have\ncustomers? If you believe in bringing agility to the entire organization, the\nanswer to both questions is yes.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/04/Apr20_07_1162572100.jpg) Jorg\nGreuel/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/04/bring-product-thinking-to-non-product-\nteams?language=es)\n\nAt its most basic definition, a product is the way an organization delivers\nand captures value. For teams doing daily product work, it can feel relatively\neasy to define the words _product_ and _customer_. Whether it\u2019s a jet engine,\nan insurance policy, an online banking app, or mobile phone service there is\nan end customer who purchases and uses that product (athough, occasionally,\nit\u2019s a different person). A product team will work hard to get to know that\ncustomer and how the organization\u2019s products and services can be continuously\nimproved to make them more successful.\n\nThis is the core of organizational agility \u2014 shipping improvements to our\nproducts, observing and measuring customer behavior, determining whether we\nshould continue to improve or move on to something else. The faster we learn,\nthe faster we improve. Product teams \u2014 especially digital product teams \u2014\nunderstand this fundamentally.\n\nBut what if you don\u2019t work in product? What if you work in Human Resources and\nare in charge of learning and development? What if you work in the legal\ndepartment and your remit is cybersecurity policy for the company? Do you\nstill make a product? Do you have customers? If you believe in bringing\nagility to the entire organization, the answer to both questions is yes.\n\nThe question then becomes, how do you know you\u2019ve delivered value? Or captured\nit back? In a lot of cases these teams measure success by delivering on goals\nor initiatives. Did you launch the new learning management system? Success!\nDid you deliver the new cybersecurity policy to our vendors? Great job!\n\nBut do you know if this was really the best version of that policy or\ninitiative?\n\nTo answer that question, I believe we have to apply product thinking to every\nproject, initiative, and policy we create. In doing so we begin to move our\nnon-product and tech disciplines \u2014 HR, Finance, Legal, Logistics, et al \u2014 away\nfrom an output-based mindset and closer to the agile, customer-centric view\nwe\u2019re instilling in our product teams.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: an HR business partner is charged with defining,\nevaluating, buying, and implementing a new learning management system (LMS)\nand training curriculums for the entire organization. They diligently go about\nthis task getting bids, sitting through presentations, and ultimately hiring a\nvendor to build, integrate, and deploy the LMS. Congratulations? Not so fast.\nWhat if no one uses the new system? What if staff only takes the mandatory\ncourses but never explores the additional offerings the HR business partner\nspent weeks procuring and evaluating? What if the LMS itself is unusable and\nthe email volume to the HR team triples with staff complaints?\n\nEnter product thinking. If we\u2019re going to bring our non-product teams along\nwith us on our journey to business agility we have to reframe their work with\nthe language of products and customers. This begins by rethinking the\ninitiative not as a set of boxes to tick but rather as a problem to solve for\na specific set of customers. The measure of success for that problem is not\nthe deployment of a product but instead a measurable positive change in the\nbehavior of those customers. In other words, we\u2019re working towards outcomes,\nnot outputs.\n\nLet\u2019s reframe the LMS example above in this way. Instead of asking our HR team\nto research and deploy the system, the HR Business Partner or leader should\nposition it like this:\n\nOur current professional development efforts are rarely used due to lack of\nstaff awareness, difficult to find and use systems, and a catalog of offerings\nthat are irrelevant for a modern, digital workforce. This is causing a spike\nin attrition of our most valuable employees, increasing our recruiting and\nhiring costs, and hurting organizational morale \u2014 not to mention the wasted\ncost of these systems. How might we deliver better professional development\nofferings to the entire staff and ensure they\u2019re up to date on the latest\ntrends in digital business and feel like the organization is invested in their\nsuccess? We will know we\u2019ve succeeded when we see retention rates go up by 10%\nquarter over quarter, consumption of professional development content increase\ntwofold, and cost of hiring decrease by 15%.\n\nIn reframing the work for our HR team in this way, we\u2019ve done several things:\n\n  1. We\u2019ve reframed the initiative from \u201claunch an LMS\u201d to \u201cmake our people more successful.\u201d This is inherently a customer-centric focus. In this case the customers are the employees of the company.\n  2. We\u2019ve removed any mention of a solution from the assignment. This empowers our team to generate their own ideas, evaluate those ideas and determine the best course of action to make their \u201ccustomers\u201d more successful. In turn, they are more invested in the ideas they come up with and will look more broadly for innovative solutions.\n  3. We\u2019ve set clear success criteria that ensure our teams take an active interest in understanding their customers and work to continuously improve the \u201cproduct\u201d they\u2019re putting into their hands. It\u2019s no longer enough to deploy an LMS. The HR team now has to ensure its usage and then assess whether that usage is indeed a key driver of retention, hiring costs and other metrics the organization cares about.\n\nTo reduce the risk of choosing a solution (or product) that won\u2019t achieve the\nintended results, the team now has to undertake a more iterative and\nexploratory approach. They have to generate hypotheses about how to best\nachieve the desired results articulated in their problem statement. They then\nhave to test their hypotheses, get feedback from their customers or users, and\niterate those ideas based on that feedback. Sound familiar? This is exactly\nwhat customer-facing product teams do to ensure they\u2019re always delivering and\ncapturing as much value as possible.\n\nThe odds of deploying an unusable LMS with irrelevant content decrease\ndramatically when the HR team applies product thinking to their initiative. In\nfact, the end result may not end up being an LMS at all. For some companies\nsuch systems might be replaced by tactical, high-quality. in-person trainings,\nfor example.\n\nThis idea is not limited to HR, obviously. If your legal team authors\ncontracts, then those are their \u201cproducts.\u201d Your vendors are the customers of\nthose products. If a contract is irrelevant to a particular type of vendor\nyour teams will spin multiple, costly cycles customizing their templates. To\nreduce those red-line cycles, the team needs to understand the needs of their\ncustomers and deliver the most relevant contracts for each customer type.\n\nThese concepts may not be common place yet in non-product disciplines and the\norganization may wonder where to begin. Inevitably, this kind of\ntransformation, like any major change, requires leadership support and\nunderstanding. Training a team of leaders and individual contributors to put\nthese new ways of working into action is a good place to start. Once they\nunderstand how to frame the work, explore solutions, and most importantly, let\ngo of ideas that solve the customer\u2019s problem, they can share and scale their\nlearnings with the rest of the department.\n\nProduct thinking is popular with many organizations today because it brings\nthe ideas of agility, not just a templated agile process, to the product\nteams. These ideas, however, are not limited to product and tech teams.\nOrganizational agility is a welcome transformation in every department. By\napproaching the work you do as a product with specific customers, giving your\nteams problems to solve and measuring their success with outcomes, rather than\noutputs, you create a company-wide customer-centric culture and ensure that\nwhether someone is buying a product from you, is employed by you, or contracts\nwith your organization you\u2019re always maximizing both their success and yours.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2012/05/110-Jeff_Gothelf.jpg)\n\n[Jeff Gothelf](/search?term=jeff%20gothelf&search_type=search-all) is an\norganizational designer and executive coach.

leaders in a digital world: Microsoft Thailand's HR\nhead\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement. [Find out more about the webinars\n\u00bb](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\n\n### _Nadya Oenara asks_ Chutima Sribumrungsart _, Deputy Managing Director \u2013\nHuman Resources, Microsoft (Thailand) all we need to know about leaders\nrequiring to be open to learning, listening to new ideas, accepting risk,\nhaving courage to share failures, and more._\n\n### Q What is the mindset that leaders require in order to actually succeed in\na digital world? And what\u2019s HR role here?\n\nThe success DNA in a digital world consists of speed, agility and\nintelligence. These three are critical for all members in the organisation and\nrequire leaders to exhibit attributes that set the tone from the top, and\nmindsets that support real change.\n\nA growth mindset has become a key characteristic of the digital era. Leaders\nare required to be open to learning, listen to new idea, accept risks, have\ncourage to share failures, give others the opportunity to try new things, and\nhave high empathy towards their teams.\n\nWith the expectation for leaders to transform their mindsets, HR has the\nopportunity to support leaders in identifying the required behaviours, shaping\nand developing these new behaviours, provide coaching, sharing feedback, and\nbe a bouncing board for leader.\n\nNot only in supporting leaders, HR also has a role to play in acting as the\norchestrator in the organisation to connect teams together, ensuring that\nchange happen across the board and aligns with company strategies.\n\n### Q How strongly do you find organisations tailoring their HR policies and\nsystems to localised needs?\n\nBased on my experiences and observation, I see HR policies being gradually\nmodernised in response to the changes in business expectations, employee\nprofile and value proposition.\n\nThe speed of change depends on each industry. I found multinational or\ninternational companies taking a more structural approach and most likely\ncustomising their policies to local requirements, both from a statutory as\nwell as cultural context.\n\nWhat really makes this effort successful is when the organisation has a clear\nvision and strategies for its organisation & people management function, which\nwill translate into the right policies that align to support the business.\n\n> ##### Especially in tough situations, challenges provide me a chance to\n> learn, experiment and develop new solutions to help the organisation.\n\n### Q What is the biggest motivation that keeps you going when things get\ntough in your role?\n\nMy personal principle is 'everything is possible', and my positive energy is\ndriven from seeing positive outcomes in helping others succeed. Therefore when\nI face challenges, I see them as opportunities. Especially in tough\nsituations, these provide me a chance to learn, experiment and develop new\nsolutions to help the organisation.\n\nMost importantly, I don\u2019t take such things personally. I focus more on the\ncontext of the challenge and work things out from there. I make sure to\nreflect on the learning and appreciate the impact of contribution, and of\ncourse, take out time to enjoy and smell the roses. \ud83d\ude0a\n\n### Q In your experience, what is the biggest talent challenge Thailand is\nfacing, and how are you tackling that?\n\nDigital transformation, skill economy, changing lifestyles, expectations from\norganisations, and shortage of digital talents are all challenges in the area\nof talent. These lead to business challenges in terms of ensuring continuity,\nability to grow at desired speed, optimising productivity and delivering great\nresults to investors.\n\nIt is important for each organisation to first understand that the talent\nagenda is a business agenda, and not an HR agenda. It requires business\nleaders to own and drive this agenda by partnering with HR.\n\nIn my experience, a simple proven rule of success is how we can engage with\nthe business and hold business leaders accountable in driving the talent\nagenda as one of the business rhythms.\n\nSetting expectations, defining ownership and expected deliverables on talent\ntopics through acquisition, managing, developing, engaging and retaining - our\nrole in HR is to enable people leader skills for all people managers in the\norganisation and empower them to own their talent pools.\n\nHR needs to reform how we drive the talent agenda in the organisation through\nthe disruption that is happening now.\n\n### Q What can HR do to better support and add value to the organisation?\n\nHR in the disruptive world plays the pivotal role of partnering with business\nleaders to enable organisation transformation and cope with rapid changes.\n\nOur role, capability and expectations from the organisation are also being\ndisrupted and we require significant transformation to lead the organisation\nand people agenda. The HR world of back-office support no longer exists and we\nhave to shape our ways to deliver the HR function in a more strategic way,\nthis identifying business impact through HR methodology and deliverables.\n\nCritical to success in making an impact through our function lies in how we\nshift from HR-centric to business-centric. HR professionals are required to\nreskill towards high-capability business acumen, envisioning, systematic &\nanalytical thinking, stakeholder engagement, and storytelling. These are all\ncritical capabilities to enable our role to create value to the organisation\nand people.\n\nOur success is, and will be, defined by business impact as well as customer\n(both internal and external) experience, which will be driven by all HR core\nservices that align to business strategies.\n\n> ##### It is my honour to provide my viewpoint as a judge to all applicants\n> and also learn how the HR function in Thailand has developed and transformed\n> to become a critical function in each organisation.\n\n### Q For you, what is the most exciting thing about being a judge at the\n[first-ever HR Excellence Awards, Thailand 2020](http://bit.ly/39mKEhy)?\n\nFirst of all, I would like to express my sincere thank you to Human Resources\nOnline for this opportunity.\n\nIt is my honour to provide my viewpoint as a judge to all applicants and also\nlearn how the HR function in Thailand has developed and transformed to become\na critical function in each organisation.

The new face of HR should not be faceless.\n\n![HR is a contact sport](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1586178442/1586178441.jpg)\n\nThe factory looked like a war-zone. Much company property had been destroyed.\nThere were serious injuries. I won\u2019t reveal the nature of the injuries or when\nthis episode took place to prevent the organization where it happened from\nbeing identified. Besides, such explosions are frequent enough for us not to\nprobe the specifics of a particular instance. In nine out of ten cases of\nviolence at the workplace, the management is taken totally by surprise and has\nno time to plan counter-measures, leave aside preempt the conflagration. While\nmany people have analyzed the fundamental causes of industrial violence, my\nlimited purpose here is to understand why early warning systems, which could\nhave prevented the worst excesses, failed and how we can prevent such failures\nthat repeatedly catch us with descended lower-garments.\n\nThe single thread that is common to almost all workplace violence is a break\nin the chain of face-to-face communication between people at the Bottom of the\nPyramid and HR/ER people whose reports reach top decision-makers. The greater\nworry is that the newer models we are adopting for organizing and managing HR\nmake catastrophic failures in feedback channels more rather than less likely.\n\n> The height of fashion nowadays is to find a tech solution to every issue.\n> For example, grievance handling, that required all the skills of naturally\n> intelligent and sensitive humans to resolve is now proudly declared to be\n> the domain of artificially intelligent and utterly insensitive bots\n\n### Losing touch\n\nThe example at the start of this column illustrates the most prevalent reason\nfor HR losing personal touch with its most important constituency \u2013 people.\nWhile ever greater proportions of value-add have been shoveled into the hands\nof contract workers, the redirection of HR attention to what has, in many\norganizations, become the larger part of the workforce, is not just inadequate\nbut negligible. Rare is the ER/IR manager who actually meets with members of\nthe precariat even occasionally, and with a grievance resolution mindset.\nSmall wonder then that embers of discontent smouldering in that part of the\nworking population are overlooked till they burst into uncontrollable flames.\nYet, even if Indian industry gets over its addiction to contracted1 or\nuberized workers (I hope I have sufficient rebirths left to see either happen)\nor learns to give them the same ER care and support as it extends to its\nregular workforce, there are other fast-growing fashion trends that are\ndrastically reducing face-to-face communications with employees.\n\n> HR interactions obviously don\u2019t need to stop only with listening. The reason\n> conversations with HR can be more practically beneficial are the skills the\n> HR practitioner is expected to demonstrate in counselling employees to get a\n> more realistic perception of their problems\n\nFirst comes the noble-sounding (but actually lazy) program to push HR tasks\n(especially the ones that can\u2019t be done in air-conditioned comfort behind the\nprotection of a computer monitor or in the luxury of a posh training centre)\nto line managers. The first casualty of the offloading drive is the messy but\nessential need to meet employees at all levels regularly. Don\u2019t get me wrong.\nIt is important for line managers also to be in touch with their teams through\nnon-task interactions. But there is no law that prevents a second channel of\ncommunication from being set up via HR. The value of such a parallel path\nbecomes blindingly obvious when the channel through the chain of command\nbecomes blocked or distorted, as it can all too easily in times of churn or\nstaffing by inexperienced supervisors. Even worse is the situation when the\nproblem to be reported lies somewhere within the same reporting hierarchy or\nwhen that channel is mis-utilized to message what suits an ambitious manager\u2019s\nagenda. If HR has given up its own eyes and ears, its people are reduced to\nbeing dumb Myrmidons, powerless to confirm or contradict faulty reports\nemanating through the line conduit, and simply carrying out their demands.\n\nAnother surefire recipe to lose touch with one\u2019s own people is to outsource\nthose activities of HR that yield a large volume of interactions across\nlevels. What is sneeringly called HR operations and considered untouchable by\nthe upper caste business partner elites is actually a treasure trove of\ninformation about what is truly happening and of all the corns and callouses\naffecting employee satisfaction. What is an extremely valuable by-product of\nproviding an employee service in-house, by the HR business partner, evaporates\nwithout a trace when it is outsourced and almost to the same extent when it is\ncentralized.\n\nThe height of fashion nowadays, of course, is to find a tech solution to every\nissue. For example, grievance handling, that required all the skills of\nnaturally intelligent and sensitive humans to resolve is now proudly declared\nto be the domain of artificially intelligent and utterly insensitive bots.\nWhile much of the debate in the community today is about whether chatbots can\ndo what a human HR professional does (and of the dangerous snafus they can\ncause)2, my concern here is the loss of face-to-face contact such a\nsubstitution brings. Bot solutions are doubly disadvantageous in this context.\nIn the first place, they leave employees feeling shortchanged that the\norganization doesn\u2019t deem them worthy of a person listening to their concerns\n(surely top management doesn\u2019t get bottled up like this). Even if employees\u2019\nproblems are solved, it is unlikely that they will feel grateful and indebted\n\u2013 those are not sentiments that can easily be felt towards bots or\ntransferred, from them, to organizations. Secondly, it will be very difficult\nfor bots to extract information of the preemptive type we have been discussing\nout of standard service requests and day-to-day grievances. Information that\ncan be used to forestall IR breakdowns, formulate policies or identify\nindividuals for progression or observation are by nature equivocal.\n\"Equivocality means ambiguity, the existence of multiple and conflicting\ninterpretations about an organizational situation\u2026 Equivocality means that\nasking a yes-no question is not feasible\u2026 The key factor in equivocality\nreduction is the extent to which structural mechanisms facilitate the\nprocessing of rich information.\"3 At the top of the ranking for dealing with\nrich communication is our humble, age-old accessory: face-to-face\ncommunication. Bots don\u2019t even enter the rankings.\n\n### Know your people\n\nUncovering or predicting disruptions in industrial harmony are certainly not\nthe only, or even the most important, benefits of Human Resources having\nregular human-to-human contact at all levels in the organization. Let\u2019s look\nat some more significant and hard-to-replace gains from this contact sport.\n\nCases abound of major transformation initiatives in highly regarded companies\ncoming to grief simply because they had no process in place for sounding out a\ncross section of employees before embarking on a major policy change affecting\nthem. Ongoing face-to-face contacts are not just invaluable for anticipating\nreactions to substantive people policy revisions (and possibly tweaking them\nin the direction of greater acceptability). They are equally useful for\nevaluating reactions on the ground once changes are announced and making quick\ncourse corrections before reactions and resistances reach the point when they\ncan only be assuaged by the bathwater, the baby and the baby\u2019s father, all\nbeing thrown out.\n\n> Listening to people and solving individual problems are as much a core part\n> of an HR person\u2019s job as the grandiose visioning, meticulous planning and\n> flawless execution that are more easily assessed and rewarded\n\nAnother of the great advantages of face-to-face communication is that it is\ntwo way. Apart from using the opportunity to understand what is bothering\nemployees or gauging their reactions to impending policy pronouncements, such\ncontacts provide the perfect setting for credible communication of what is\nimportant to the company. There are plans and responses to competition that\nare difficult to explain believably in writing or through other one-way\nchannels. Moreover, when disaffected employees, hostile unions or unfriendly\noutsiders are spreading disinformation and it is deemed unwise even to\nacknowledge it by giving a documentary response, these meetings are among the\nfew ways in which employee opinion can be kept firmly favorable.\n\nOver the decades I have been privileged to observe the performance of hundreds\nof young men and women in HR/ER. One characteristic that distinguished those\nwho had a natural flair for dealing with people (and, hence, their outstanding\nsuccess in HR) was their insistence on spending most of their time with the\npeople they were supporting rather than at their tables in their offices.\nToday, those tables carry colorful computer screens with all the attractions\n(strictly professional, of course) the cloud has on offer and the offices are\nairconditioned. But if youngsters find it more difficult to tear themselves\naway from their work stations now, the need to meet with people in person has\nalso become more acute because transitory tenures demand more frequent\nmeetings if trust has to build before individuals move on. It is not only the\ndevelopment of young HR professionals that is assisted by constant people\ninteractions. It remains one of the few ways by which senior leaders\n(including CHROs) can keep their feet on the ground and retain a feel for what\nis happening at the grassroot level.\n\n### Help your people\n\nAs important as keeping HR aware of the reality on the ground and equipping it\nto craft successful policies and processes is the way in which regular face-\nto-face interactions with people can resolve issues troubling individual\nemployees before they fester into disaffection, destruction or departure. On\nthe positive side, there is also no substitute for such individual meetings by\nHR in the recipe for building commitment and belongingness among employees at\nlarge. By just listening to the problems, concerns and aspirations of\nindividuals, HR is signaling its commitment to the welfare and happiness of\npeople. No friend, however patient and available, can reaffirm the\nindividual\u2019s worth to the organization in this manner. It needs the commitment\nof a HUMAN Resource by HR to substantiate its stated intent of caring for\npeople. Of course, this requires that HR professionals are trained in active\nlistening4 so that the impact is positive even in those instances where they\ncannot provide useful counsel or more direct help.\n\nHR interactions obviously don\u2019t need to stop only with listening. The reason\nconversations with HR can be more practically beneficial than talking things\nover with a friend or even a line supervisor are the skills the HR\npractitioner is expected to demonstrate in counselling employees to get a more\nrealistic perception of their problems while tapping their internal reservoir\nof strengths in coping with them. In addition to counselling is also the\nknowledge-base HR professionals should have about which policy or avenue of\nappeal is likely to be most efficacious. This should be supplemented by case\nknowledge of how employees in other parts of the organization have been aided\nin similar situations.\n\nWhile not always possible, there are a significant number of opportunities for\nHR practioners to intervene directly and solve problems. These interventions\nmay take the form of talking things over with the line manager (especially if\ns/he is the origin of the problem), championing the employee\u2019s case where\nthere is discretion in the hands of a senior HR or line decision-maker or\nproviding some limited coaching in overcoming an internal barrier to the\nproblem resolution. An external shared-service provider is hardly ever in a\nposition or sufficiently motivated to provide such help and an AI-bot is\nobviously much less so. Even if they were capable, the gratitude and\nconsequential commitment would not flow back to the company or to HR and\nwould, therefore, not be available for future 'drawal' when individual\nemployee support (aggregated over many instances) can make all the difference\nin managing a crisis or a transformation program.\n\nA competent HR professional with a well-tuned antenna should also be able to\nprovide secondary guidance to an employee. The initial contact may arise from\nan internal job interview, an employee approaching with a grievance or an\nemployee contact program but, as part of the dialogue, the HR interlocutor may\ndiscover an employee\u2019s talents, contact networks or side interests that could\nbe useful in another assignment or as a member of a task team or a voluntary\nactivity \u2013 something that may have never come to light otherwise.\n\n### Actively reaching all\n\nListening to people and solving individual problems are as much a core part of\nan HR person\u2019s job as the grandiose visioning, meticulous planning and\nflawless execution that are more easily assessed and rewarded. Those seemingly\ntrivial interruptions by individual employees, far from being distractions,\nare HR\u2019s special moments of truth5 which demonstrate, employee by employee,\nwhether the knowledge, skills and empathy with which we claim to be so well-\nstocked, can actually be converted to practical problem resolution which, in\nturn, builds good will towards HR and the organization at large.\n\nOf course, employees feeling the need and having the trust to approach HR with\ntheir problems are just one source of opportunities for interaction. There are\nmyriads of others which fall into the laps of HR practitioners without any\neffort on their part. They can come from processes as varied as Q&A during\ntraining programs, counseling for late-coming, absenteeism or indiscipline\nhandling and even from exit interviews. Regardless of the process of origin,\neach of these opportunities for face-to-face interaction can help employees\nsolve problems and get developmental aid while yielding valuable feedback to\nand positive affect for the organization.\n\nRich as the yields may be from the interactions initiated by employees or\nother people processes, they cannot possibly cover all employees. In my bible,\nunless each employee is personally 'touched' by an HR person on a regular\nbasis, HR is failing in one of key roles \u2013 knowing and solving people problems\nboth individually and systemically. To achieve this goal, organizations need\nto institute programs for reaching out to every single employee on multiple\noccasions each year. Every HR person from the CHRO down and including the ones\nworking in back office or routine clerical roles should spend between half to\na full day every week on this activity. For those HR people who do not meet\ncross-sections of employees as part of their job, these meetings would yield\nthe secondary benefit of knowing the reality and reactions of the ultimate\ncustomers who their policies or back office work support. To prevent the\nexercise from being threatening or perfunctory, those unused to employee\ninteractions would need to be given a brief orientation and everyone would\nutilize a basic checklist for the meeting followed by a brief on-line report.\n\n> In my bible, unless each employee is personally 'touched' by an HR person on\n> a regular basis, HR is failing in one of key roles - knowing and solving\n> people problems both individually and systemically\n\n### Drop by drop\n\nCan such simple meetings really add up to much? Should they take us away from\nthe killer schemes that win us awards and get our names plastered all over the\nmedia? Thought leadership and pioneering projects are immensely fulfilling and\nperiodically essential. However, they cannot substitute the most fundamental\nand frequently used tool in the HR person\u2019s kit: the face-to-face meeting. At\nsuch times it is useful to remember (a slightly tweaked version of) Julia\nCarney\u2019s poem6 for children,\n\n_Little drops of water  \n_ _Little grains of sand,  \n_ _Make the mighty ocean,  \n_ _And the pleasant land.  \n_ _\u2026.  \n_ _Little deeds of kindness,  \n_ _Little words of cheer,  \n_ _Make our people happy,  \n_ _And drive away their fear._\n\n_Notes:_\n\n_1.[Visty Banaji, Udta Udyog \u2013 Industry\u2019s addiction to contract workers,\nPeople Matters, 15th September\n2016.](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/temporary-and-contract-\nstaffing/udta-udyogindustrys-addiction-to-contract-workers-14090)_\n\n_2\\.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Innovation](/innovation)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nTammy Cohen\n\nFounder and Chief Visionary Officer of [InfoMart](http://www.infomart-\nusa.com/), a global background screening company.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nPhoto:\n\nGetty\n\nWe\u2019ve entered a new decade of technological advances and cutting-edge toys for\nHR teams. Some of the main questions for HR tech in 2020 are as follows: Is it\ntime to consolidate our tech integrations or branch out? Will trends transfer\nto reality, or will they fall short of our expectations? As the owner of a\nbackground screening company, and as an expert in HR and hiring for over 30\nyears, I have five tips to see you through the decision-making process as you\nrefine your HR technology suite for 2020 and beyond.\n\n**Secure The Core Four**\n\nThere are some systems our HR teams can\u2019t live without. The \u201ccore four\u201d are\nintegral to a robust, streamlined HR strategy. HR professionals need systems\nfor recruitment, human capital management, benefits management and learning\nmanagement. Having these four systems in place will help your recruitment and\nretention strategies to succeed.\n\nUnemployment is [low](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/unemployment-rate-falls-\nlowest-level-50-years/story?id=66058946), and the labor market is\n[tight](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-employment/tight-us-\njob-market-not-attracting-new-people-to-the-labor-force-paper-idUSKCN1SQ24S).\nApplicant tracking systems (ATS), background screening systems and recruitment\nsoftware ensure you can secure top candidates quickly. My experience gives me\na unique perspective on the recruitment process. What\u2019s clear is the power of\nconnecting your ATS and screening program. This integration can move\nmountains, shaving days off your hiring turnaround time.\n\nEmployee retention is just as important as getting new employees hired and\nonboarded. All HR managers and directors understand the value of a human\ncapital management (HCM) and benefits manager, especially when the job market\nis tight and recruitment strategies are so important. Learning management\nsystems (LMS) offer discounted or free resources to your existing employees,\npromoting development that benefits both the individual and the company.\nThey're great tools to inspire loyalty and appreciation, improving your\nretention rate in the process.\n\nSecure these core four pieces of HR technology, and you\u2019ll be ready to take on\n2020.\n\n**Single Suite Or Integration Nation**\n\nThis is one of the biggest debates in HR technology. Is it better to entrust\nHR technology processes to a single provider, or should you utilize only the\nbest of each service and integrate across platforms? Celebrated HR influencer\nSteve Boese wrote on this not too long ago when he outlined [the pros and cons\nof both options](https://hrexecutive.com/single-suite-or-best-of-breed-which-\nis-better/).\n\nMy answer is to expect more from your providers\u2019 integration capabilities.\nCompanies can put in the work for your business, so don\u2019t rule out a\ncombination of the best of the best. Your partners should be willing to work\ntogether to make your processes easier.\n\n**Tried And True Or Shiny And New**\n\nI recommend selecting an experienced vendor, rather than choosing a new player\non the field, especially when it comes to HR technology. The best part about\nworking with an industry expert is that they understand when to innovate, when\nto stick with tried-and-true methods, and how to get the job done.\n\nCompanies like IBM and ADP run their prospective industries because they\ndesign new products and have the experience to back up their decisions. My\nrecommendation here is to choose a tried-and-true provider if the company is\nopen to and striving for consistent technological innovation.\n\n**Budget Versus Build It**\n\nThere are times in business when, no matter your dreams and inspiration for\nthe perfect suite of services, cost will always take priority. When it comes\nto your applicants\u2019 and employees\u2019 experiences, invest. Employees stay where\nthey\u2019re cared for; finding the right technology to assist you in taking care\nof your team should take priority.\n\nThis applies to the hiring process, benefits management, payroll, worker\u2019s\ncomp and more. It\u2019s the little things that add up, and a streamlined process\nwill elevate your company\u2019s reputation. Build your technology suite. You won\u2019t\nregret it when you\u2019re attracting top talent.\n\n**The Immediate Versus The Ultimate**\n\nPartnerships should be built to last. I\u2019ve seen how technology partners can\ncome and go after only a couple of years because they end up not being the\nright fit. Decision-makers need to consider immediate need versus ultimate\npartnerships. Prioritize partnerships over immediacy when you can. This isn\u2019t\na decision based solely on capabilities and cost, but it's a question of\ncustomer service and brand loyalty. This will be a partner you rely on in\ntimes of turmoil, and their customer service team must be able to provide for\nyour people. Cultivating the right partners keeps your company stable, your\nemployees and candidates happy, and your customers satisfied.\n\nHR tech\u2019s offerings are only going to continue to grow. Keep a keen eye on\nyour end goals and ultimate needs when the time comes to build your suite.\nIt\u2019s worth a second, or seventh, look.\n\n[Forbes Technology\nCouncil](http://www.forbestechcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology\nexecutives. **_[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbestechcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)_**\n\n[![Tammy Cohen](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbestechcouncil/files/2020/03/tammycohen_avatar_1583529502.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/tammycohen/\n\"Photo of Tammy Cohen\")\n\n[Tammy\nCohen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/people/tammycohen/)\n\nFounder and Chief Visionary Officer of [InfoMart](http://www.infomart-\nusa.com), a global background screening company.

officer of CoreHR, which is being acquired by\nAccess Group\n\n**The current circumstances, driven by Covid-19, are challenging for any\norganisation. But how do you cope if you 're in the middle of an acquisition?\nPersonnel Today spoke to Sharon Looney of HR and payroll software company\nCoreHR, which is in the process of being acquired by Access Group. **\n\nLike many HR professionals, Sharon Looney \u2013 chief people officer of CoreHR \u2013\nhas had to make a dramatic switch from business as usual to enabling the\nentire company to work from home as the coronavirus crisis worsened. As if\nthat wasn\u2019t testing enough, the HR team at CoreHR have an additional challenge\nto deal with \u2013 the company is in the middle of being acquired by another\norganisation, the Access Group.\n\n## Coronavirus guidance\n\n**[Letter providing guidance for staff on\ncoronavirus](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/policies-and-documents/letter-\nproviding-guidance-for-staff-on-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-/164985/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n**[Businesses and unions react to\nUK'lockdown'](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/news/businesses-and-unions-react-to-\nuk-\nlockdown/165061/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\nThe [acquisition was announced in early\nMarch](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/access-group-corehr-deal/), and the\ntwo companies are to officially come together at the end of April. CoreHR will\nform part of a new Access Group division called Access People, which will have\na turnover of more than \u00a3100m and the clout to make it one of the leading HR\nand payroll software providers in the UK.\n\nDealing with mergers and acquisitions can be a trying time for HR at the best\nof times, so how does it feel for Looney and her team to be managing this\nchange during these unexpected circumstances?\n\n\u201cTo say it\u2019s surreal would be an understatement,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all became\ntechnologists overnight, customer focus agents overnight. I think even if we\nhad been forewarned about something like this a quarter ago we would not have\nmobilised so quickly. Seeing how teams wanted to protect customers was\nuplifting, how they became accountable and were making decisions for\nthemselves.\u201d\n\nAs with many organisations, CoreHR has been making the most of platforms such\nas Microsoft Teams, and colleagues are \u2018socialising\u2019 with each other through\nchannels such as WhatsApp. If anything, colleagues are \u201chyperconnected\u201d, says\nLooney. It has been important to retain some of the usual routine: planned\nweekly welcome meetings from Access Group to introduce the business to the\nCoreHR workforce will still go ahead but online, for example.\n\n\u201cAll of our customer meetings are still happening, we have the same daily or\nweekly cadences,\u201d she adds. \u201cWhere there are group meetings that were supposed\nto be face to face, people have had to get used to listening more when they\ncan\u2019t see someone writing on a whiteboard or asking people to clarify what\nthey\u2019re saying.\u201d Meanwhile there are a number of physical \u2018getting to know\nyou\u2019 meetings for the two companies planned for when social distancing rules\nhave been relaxed.\n\n## On target\n\nIn terms of the progress of the acquisition, this is still all going according\nto plan. Looney describes the team at Access Group as \u201ctremendously\nprofessional, systematic and supportive\u201d and says it helps that everyone knows\nthe timelines, how each function feeds into the overall plan and who should be\ndoing what. \u201cThere was a very early camaraderie between the two teams and a\nfeeling [the acquisition] was right for both organisations,\u201d she says.\n\n\"We\u2019ve had to rethink how we communicate, what we communicate and think very\ncarefully about what might confuse employees.\"\n\nNaturally, employees feel unsettled by the impact of the coronavirus, and this\nis where clear communication has been crucial. \u201cFrom an HR perspective\nemployees are still getting used to the fact that they will be part of a much\nlarger organisation. We\u2019ve had to rethink how we communicate, what we\ncommunicate and think very carefully about what might confuse employees. \u201cWe\nneed to help our people differentiate between what\u2019s changing due to Covid,\nversus what\u2019s changing due to acquisition,\u201d Looney explains.\n\nAs well as working on communications and preparations for the new company, the\nHR team has been fielding questions from employees on support for home\nworking, and many \u2018what if\u2019 questions about how they and their teams might\ncope if the virus impacts them personally in the coming weeks. \u201cPeople want to\nbe sure they\u2019re doing the right thing, who they should notify. Since the\ngovernment issued stricter guidelines around self-isolation and social\ndistancing it\u2019s become easier, if anything,\u201d she says. There is a definite\ndesire to feel connected, which helps with the integration process, too.\n\n## Switching off\n\nOne thing Looney is mindful of, however, is not to make employees feel as\nthough they need to be connected at all times. \u201cWe\u2019re now all comfortable at\nhome and we\u2019re getting used to the idea,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the next thing we\nneed to do is relieve ourselves from the pressure that we have to answer every\nvideo call, respond to everything. Life goes on at home, so stop apologising\nfor putting the washing outside, your dog barking or your kid walking up to\nthe computer screen.\u201d\n\nNot reinventing the wheel as the company deals with the challenges thrown up\nby the coronavirus has helped, too. Expanding existing policies on remote\nworking, for example, and keeping the same look and feel in communications has\nhelped to keep things familiar for staff.\n\nOnce the official acquisition transaction has taken place in April, there are\nfurther integration targets for the end of CoreHR\u2019s fiscal year in June. But\neven these unpredictable times won\u2019t stop Looney and her team meeting their\ngoals. \u201cWe\u2019ve mobilised ourselves and [the virus] is not going to stop this,\u201d\nshe insists.\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/what-will-shape-the-\nmanagers-of-the-future/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/delay-increase-to-national-\nliving-wage-says-ifs/)\n\n### One Response to _Handling an acquisition during the coronavirus crisis_\n\n  1. ![Avatar](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9303b5c2c491f5c423b890e74abaaa9e?s=40&d=mm&r=g)\n\n[Dan R Bradbary](https://pmiadvisors.com/) 28 Mar 2020 at 3:45 pm\n[#](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/coping-with-coronavirus-during-a-\nmerger/#comment-87339 \"Direct link to this comment\")\n\nYour ideas are right on target!

Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\nSingapore's Government has accepted the [National Wages Council (NWC)\nGuidelines for 2020/2021](https://snef.org.sg/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/NWC_briefing2020_2021.pdf), the Ministry of Manpower\n[announced yesterday](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-\nreleases/2020/0330-government-accepts-national-wages-council-guidelines-\nfor-2020-2021) (30 March).\n\nThese guidelines, which were released early to mitigate the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, will apply for the period of 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2021,\nthus superseding the 2019/2020 Guidelines effective 1 April.\n\n**In sustaining the business and saving jobs, employers are urged to consider\nfour key points[in the guidelines](https://snef.org.sg/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/NWC_briefing2020_2021.pdf), in order of priority:**\n\n  * **#1** Reducing non-wage costs, managing excess manpower\n  * **#2** Tapping on Government support, pressing on with business and workforce transformation\n  * **#3** Trimming wage costs (Wage recommendations)\n  * **#4** As a last resort, responsible retrenchment\n\n### #1 Reduce non-wage costs, manage excess manpower\n\nTaking into account the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and\nResponsible Retrenchments, which was [updated earlier in\nMarch](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/update-what-employers-must-know-\nbefore-retrenching-employees-in-singapore/), the NWC affirms the need for\nemployers to take a long-term view of their manpower needs, including the need\nto maintain a strong Singaporean core, notwithstanding the economic\nuncertainty brought on by COVID-19.\n\nThus, the NWC recommends that the following steps:\n\n**Focus on training and upskilling**\n\nThis will be covered under section #2 below.\n\n**Adopt flexible work schedules**\n\nFor instance, employers can reduce weekly working hours without having to\nadjust wages, by creating a \"time bank\" of unused working hours, which will\nthen be used to offset the increase in working hours in subsequent periods.\n\nThis way, employers are able to optimise the use of their manpower.\n\n**Support affected local employees who wish to seek a second job to supplement\nincome**\n\nIn the event an employer implements job-sharing arrangements, temporary\nlayoffs, or a shorter workweek, they should support employees who are keen on\ntaking on an external part-time or temporary role.\n\nThe guidelines add: \"To help companies save jobs, employees are also urged to\nsupport employers' cost-cutting measures and reasonable efforts to manage\nexcess manpower. Unemployed workers should also take advantage of training\nsupport schemes to upgrade themselves and be flexible in accepting new job\nopportunities.\"\n\n### **#2 Press on with business and workforce transformation**\n\nAs part of the [Resilience\nBudget](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/singapores-s48bn-\ncovid-19-resilience-budget-key-takeaways-for-hr-and-employers/) announced last\nweek, the Jobs Support Scheme has been enhanced and extended, wherein the\nGovernment will now co-fund 25%-75% of wages, depending on sectors.\n\nIn light of this, employers are encouraged to accelerate the implementation of\nbusiness and workforce transformation initiatives, to then gain a competitive\nadvantage and be better prepared to grow when the economy recovers.\n\nUnder this umbrella, the NWC recommends:\n\n**Bring forward planned training programmes**\n\nEmployers are advised to bring forward any planned training they may have for\nemployees, in order to put their employees' downtime during this period to\nproductive use.\n\nFor those who have yet to develop training plans, they can get assistance from\nthe National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Training, Singapore Business\nFederation, Singapore National Employers Federation, NTUC LearningHub, the\nunions and other relevant trade associations and chambers.\n\nEmployers may also tap on SkillsFuture for course fee subsidies and absentee\npayroll support; further support will be provided in the form of enhanced\ncourse fee subsidies, to sectors particularly impacted by COVID-19.\n\n**Bring forward the implementation of productivity initiatives**\n\nEmployers should take steps to redesign jobs and train employees for these new\njobs, with aid from the Stabilisation and Support Package revealed in\n[February's Budget 2020](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/singapore-\nbudget-2020-key-takeaways-for-hr-leaders-and-employers/).\n\nEmployers should also, where possible invest in training all employees in\nemerging skills, so they can remain employable and not at risk of redundancy.\nEligible employers may tap on the new SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit to defray\n90% of out-of-pocket expenses for business transformation, job redesign and\nskills training.\n\n**Establish Company Training Committees with the labour movement**\n\nAccording to the NWC, more than 450 Company Training Committees (CTCs) have\nbeen established so far, in aiding employers to build up their in-house\nworkplace learning capabilities, conduct ops-tech road mapping, and re-\nstrategise their business\n\n**Share productivity gains with employees**\n\nEmployers who share their productivity gains with their employees will benefit\nfrom the enhanced Wage Credit scheme, which subsidises qualifying wage\nincreases for locals.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/31120242/Priya-Mar-2020-NWC-\nGuidelines-2-e1585628411889.jpg)\n\n\n\n### #3 Trimming wage costs (Wage recommendations)\n\nThe following recommendations apply:\n\n**Management to lead by example, in the event of wage reduction**\n\nIn the event an employer is adversely impacted by the outbreak and faces\nuncertain prospects, they may exercise wage reduction, with management leading\nby example.\n\nDepending on their financial position and prospects, these employers may\nconsider reducing variable payments, in accordance with the [Tripartite\nAdvisory](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/update-what-employers-must-\nknow-before-retrenching-employees-in-singapore/). As wage reduction measures\naffect the livelihood of employees, especially over an extended period of\ntime, employers should seek the consent of unions and engage employees before\nimplementing such measures.\n\n**Employers should take into account employees whose wages are impacted**\n\nFor employees who can't work overtime or receive overtime pay, those with\ncommission-based variable payments, or those who have been asked to take no-\npay leave, employers should take these factors into account if they are\nconsidering a reduction in other wage components.\n\n**Adjusting monthly variable wage components**\n\nIf monthly wage levels are unsustainable, employers can consider adjusting\nmonthly variable wage components. Under the flexible wage system, the monthly\nvariable component (MVC), which is part of the basic wage, allows employers to\nadjust wages quickly in response to changes in the business environment\nwithout having to wait until the end of the year to adjust variable bonus\npayments and other annual variable components.\n\nIn the above scenario, employers can consider adjusting it downwards. The\nextent of the adjustment would depend on the employer's situation and any key\nperformance indicators or guidelines for triggering a cut as agreed with the\nunion (if the company is unionised) or employees.\n\nFor the rest of employers that have not implemented this MVC but need to\nadjust monthly wages downwards, they could consider treating any cut in basic\nwages of up to 10% as an MVC cut. In the case of management, depending on the\ncircumstances and requirements of the company, the component set aside could\nbe more than 10% of basic wages, in line with the principle of leadership by\nexample.\n\nEmployers should set clear guidelines to restore MVC or basic wage cuts\nthrough future wage increases or adjustments when the business recovers.\n\n**Employers should endeavour to pay the Annual Wage Supplement, adjust wages\nof all workers fairly**\n\nAs far as possible, the NWC affirms that employers should endeavour to pay\ntheir employees the Annual Wage Supplement, as recognising employees \"fairly\"\nwill enable these employers to retain and inspire loyalty in their workforce\nand be well-positioned for the recovery.\n\nLast, any reduction of wages that an employer takes should be applied to local\nand foreign employees fairly.\n\nApart from the above, companies that have done or are still doing well are\nencouraged to continue rewarding their employees accordingly. If business\nprospects are uncertain, they may exercise moderation in built-in wage\nincreases.\n\nWith regard to low-wage workers - the NWC \"strongly recommends that employers\ngive special consideration to such workers, particularly those serving in the\nfrontline of the COVID-19 response. Where wage reductions are necessary,\nemployers should adopt a graduated approach, with deeper reductions at the\nmanagement level and for higher-wage employees to effect the desired extent of\nreduction in total wage cost.\"\n\n### **#4 Responsible retrenchment**\n\nAs stated in the [updated advisory on\nretrenchment](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/update-what-employers-must-\nknow-before-retrenching-employees-in-singapore/), the NWC stresses that if\ncompanies have to resort to retrenchment despite undertaking the above\nmeasures, they should conduct this in a responsible manner. More on this can\nbe found [here](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/update-what-employers-\nmust-know-before-retrenching-employees-in-singapore/).\n\nIn a [statement](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-\nreleases/2020/0330-statement-by-minister-for-manpower-mrs-josephine-teo-on-\nthe-nwc-2020-2021-guidelines), **Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo**\nemphasised that this new set of guidelines considers the needs and\ndifficulties of both the business and workers in Singapore, providing guidance\non how employers can sustain their businesses and save jobs, as well as\noutlining what workers should expect from their employers.\n\nShe added: \"I urge employers to adopt these recommendations to help mitigate\nthe impact of COVID-19 and position Singapore for eventual recovery.

Nearly half (48%) of employers require\nemployees to use sick leave first, then vacation leave and finally potential\nPTO for coronavirus absences.\n\nTwenty percent of organisations increased PTO for individuals who are sick\nand/or caring for a sick family member; 18% of organisations have granted\nadditional PTO for parents who are caring for children whose schools are\nclosed.\n\nSeventy percent of organisations report that the main cost-cutting measure\nthey plan to use is more effective use of technology. Nearly half of\norganisations plan to freeze new hiring.\n\nA greater percentage of organisations plan to reduce work for external\npartners rather than employees -- one-fifth of organisations plan to stop or\nlimit consultant spend and/or reduce the number of contract workers. Only 10%\nof employers plan to reduce working hours, and just 6% report asking employees\nto take unpaid leave.\n\nTo manage remote talent during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gartner recommends HR\nleaders do the following:\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n  * **Provide direction, confidence and resilience.** Employees are relying on leaders at all levels of the business to take action and set the tone. Communications from senior business leaders to managers should prioritise associate health and business sustainability. Communicate regularly with employees, maintaining an open dialog. Gartner's survey found that 56% of organisations have communicated a plan of action to employees in the event the COVID-19 outbreak.\n  * **Contextualise coronavirus for the organisation.** Leaders should be a trusted source for accurate and up-to-date information on coronavirus and how it is impacting the organisation. Avoid sharing information from social media; leverage trusted resources such as the World Health Organisation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Contextualise information and data as much as possible so that it specifically relates to the organisation.\n  * **Encourage intentional peer-to-peer interactions.** With reduced or no face time in the office, employees should maintain regular professional and personal interactions with their peers. Gartner's survey found that 40% of organisations have set up additional virtual check-ins for employees with managers and 32% of organisations have introduced new tools for virtual meetings. HR leaders should encourage employees to leverage communication platforms they already use, either at work or in their personal lives, to create new ways to work together. \n  * **Establish team guidelines.** Remote work looks different for each employee depending on their needs and those of their families. With unprecedented school closures, many employees must take on a double role as they support their children and families throughout the workday. Organisations can meet employees' needs by empowering teams to adapt to their conflicting time demands. For instance, teams can set \"core team times\" when all team members are available to collaborate.\n  * **Provide flexibility for employees ' remote work needs**. When preparing for employees' eventual return to the office, empower employees to make choices best suited for their needs and comfort levels. Where possible, allow employees to decide when to return to the office. Enable essential employees whose work requires them to return to the office to choose the hours that work best for them to return to avoid peak commute times.\n\n### Related stories\n\n  * ['Being able to offer staff flexibility is the future of work'](/ca/specialization/corporate-wellness/being-able-to-offer-staff-flexibility-is-the-future-of-work/213460)\n  * [Flexibility tops wish list for jobseekers](/asia/news/general/flexibility-tops-wish-list-for-jobseekers/150130)\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily newsletters\nfrom HRD Asia.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n### Recent articles & video\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637218764030398689.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-\nbreaker-mom-advises-against-prolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: MOM advises against 'prolonged' no-pay\nleave](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-breaker-mom-advises-against-\nprolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218756963772601.jpg)](/asia/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219166)\n\n#### [How has COVID-19 impacted managers and\nemployees?](/asia/news/general/how-has-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-\nemployees/219166)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218753186012580.jpg)](/asia/news/general/ceo-\nof-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-from-a-challenge/219160)\n\n#### [CEO of HP Canada: 'I was never one to shy away from a\nchallenge'](/asia/news/general/ceo-of-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-\nfrom-a-challenge/219160)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217706478717086.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/change-\nmanagement/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-support-employees/219005)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: How can HR support\nemployees?](/asia/specialisation/change-management/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-\nsupport-employees/219005)\n\n### Most Read Articles\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n06 Apr 2020\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n__\n\n  * [HRT](https://www.hrtechnologynews.com/)\n  * [Companies](/asia/companies)\n  * [People](/asia/people)\n  * [Newsletter](/asia/newsletter)\n\n  * [About us](/asia/about-us)\n  * [Authors](/asia/authors)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/asia/privacy-policy)\n  * [Conditions of use](/asia/conditions-of-use)\n  * [Contact us](/asia/contact-us)\n  * [RSS __](/asia/rss)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/HumanResourcesDirectorAsia/)[__](https://twitter.com/HRD_Asia)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/human-\nresources-director-asia)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Key Media ![](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n"}, {"item": "Core HR Software Market dominance by 2025 -

What are the biggest\nlessons you have learned?**\n\nIn 2016, I joined M&C Saatchi as its Head of Digital. My remit was to build up\nthe digital and social media expertise for the agency, which was only focused\non traditional advertising at the time I joined. Together with my business\npartner Nicholas Leow, we were given full autonomy, and we built and grew our\nown digital team from scratch. We increased the digital revenue of the agency\nfrom 9% (before I joined), to 59% (in my first year), and to more than 80%\ntoday. Today, we have a full-fledged in-house digital specialist team with\nfull capabilities spanning across strategy, creative, web and app UX/UI,\naccount servicing, digital production and engineering.\n\nAbout 1.5 years ago, I felt it was time to embark on something new. Long story\nshort, M&C Saatchi Global and M&C Saatchi Singapore supported my journey to\nentrepreneurship and Create Collective was born. Create Collective is founded\nby seven partners \u2013 six members of the M&C Saatchi Singapore's leadership team\n(including Nicholas) and M&C Saatchi Global Network.\n\nCreate Collective is all about building brands with purpose, by humanising\ntechnology. We hope to one day be known as the company that builds great\ncommunities. At Create Collective, I\u2019m responsible for driving the overall\nstrategic direction and growth of the company.\n\nDayre is Create Collective\u2019s first offering, and it\u2019s just the beginning.\nDayre is about creating a safe and inclusive space for women \u2013 both online and\noffline. Dayre (which is an acquisition) started as a micro-blogging app, and\ntoday with Create Collective at its helm, it stands for more than that. It is\na dedicated space for women, where Real Girl Talk can take place \u2013 where women\ncan share authentic stories and reviews, unfiltered thoughts and experiences,\nand untold secrets \u2013 with a community of women who get them, or just want to\nbe there for them. On Dayre, women know that they are not alone, because they\nare connected to a community that understands, supports and empowers.\n\n> ##### Being a good, kind, and respectful person is important for obvious\n> reasons, but an added importance is that you are leading by example and this\n> can determine and shape the culture of your company.\n\nI've learned many career lessons along the way, but I think these four stood\nout for me:\n\n  * **Self-belief is very important:** As an entrepreneur who wants to be constantly innovating and pushing, very often you may be breaking \u2018rules\u2019 and doing something different that people won\u2019t quite understand why and how immediately\u2014and they will question you, challenge you, or even mock you. You need a lot of self-belief and support to push through the doubts and adversities, and keep going. For example, Dayre\u2019s proposition is a first in the world \u2013 a members-only, ad-free, and safe online space dedicated to women. We took a bold move to switch Dayre\u2019s business model from free-to-use to subscription-based, and also for Dayre to stay ad-free. Since launching, we have earned a healthy 6-figure revenue over the past four months. We are also driving a healthy number of new trial users daily via word-of-mouth.\n  * **Remember where you started:** There are people who have climbed very high in their career and have forgotten what it was like when they were just starting out. It is important to stay humble and treat everyone with respect. Being a good, kind, and respectful person is important for obvious reasons, but an added importance is that you are leading by example and this can determine and shape the culture of your company. You will want to attract people who want to work for a company that has strong ethics and values\n  * **Keep learning and stay open-minded:** I think it\u2019s no longer acceptable not to want to change the way we\u2019re doing certain things just because 'it has always been done a certain way'. The world is changing and moving faster than ever. What used to be the way of doing things will be disrupted by new processes and new ideas. Jobs that don\u2019t exist today will be in demand tomorrow. It is no longer possible to stick to comfort zones. You need to feel a certain level of discomfort because it forces you to keep learning new knowledge and stay ahead of the game.\n  * **It is important to stay true to what you believe in:** My belief is that businesses can do the right thing and remain sustainable and profitable. I count myself lucky that my partners share the same core belief. This is what led us to start Create Collective and acquire Dayre. Every business decision that we take is driven by our core belief.\n\n**Q What are some leadership best practices that have proved evergreen,\ndespite the situation, location, or remit?**\n\nFirst, **empathy is always important**. If you are successful in your career,\nyou need to also remember what it was like when you first started working. You\nneed to take time to understand and listen to employees \u2013 their struggle,\ntheir desires, their needs and wants. It is also important to respect their\npersonal time \u2013 they can\u2019t perform if they are constantly stressed out or\nburnt out. There\u2019re so many reasons why it\u2019s important for leaders to have\nempathy. You will build greater trust and confidence with your team, and in\nturn stronger relationships. It will be easier for you to help struggling\nemployees, while showing appreciation for those who\u2019re excelling and going the\nextra miles for you. If your team feels that they can trust and respect you,\nthey will get behind you.\n\n> ##### Hire based on integrity, willingness to learn, passion, and street-\n> smart \u2013 don\u2019t hire just based on paper qualifications \u2013 because again, jobs\n> that don\u2019t exist today, will be in demand tomorrow.\n\nSecond, **hire good people** **, not just smart people**. Hire based on\nintegrity, willingness to learn, passion, and street-smart \u2013 don\u2019t hire just\nbased on paper qualifications \u2013 because again, jobs that don\u2019t exist today,\nwill be in demand tomorrow. You need team players who are ready to roll up\ntheir sleeves and learn.\n\nThird, **hire diversely.** Group-think is dangerous. You will want people who\ncan bring different perspectives and ideas to the table. Make sure you\u2019re\nhiring women and focusing on grooming female leaders. Companies and leaders\nneed to do their part to level the playing field for the genders. Studies and\nstatistics have proven that companies with an equal balance of men and women\nsenior leaders perform better and make more profits.\n\n**Q Given how rampantly leadership is being disrupted, how have you seen the\nneeds from leaders change in the recent past and what are we demanding from\nthem, that we didn't previously?**\n\nIn a day and age where leaders are getting younger - it\u2019s no longer just about\nthe years of experience, job title, or how long you have been working, or\nwhich big firms you have worked at. We have people who are in their 20s\nbecoming CEOs/Founders of their own companies and making a big difference in\nthe world. So these days, when people are applying for jobs, many are looking\nbeyond the remuneration package. The younger generation of workforce wants to\nwork for someone they find compelling, human, and influential \u2013 and they want\nto work for a company with a clear purpose and vision. Many also want to work\nfor leaders that believe in a cause that is greater than just making profits.\n\nIn the same vein, the best talents expect complete trust and freedom from\ntheir leaders. They aren\u2019t just looking for a job description or a list of\ntasks to fulfil every day. They also expect companies to be adaptable and have\nindividually-designed career plans because they want autonomy and they believe\nwith this autonomy, they can make an impact. They don\u2019t want companies that\nhave a one-size-fits-all approach because they expect an environment where\nthey can grow exponentially, freely express themselves, explore their\nstrengths and weaknesses. They are no longer content with working for\ntraditional companies with rigid structures, hierarchies, and processes.\n\n> ##### The best talents expect complete trust and freedom from their leaders.\n> They aren\u2019t just looking for a job description or a list of tasks to fulfil\n> every day.\n\n**Q In this backdrop, what does the mindset of a good leader look like to you?\nAnd how can this mindset be inculcated in upcoming leaders, and front-line\nstaff as well?**\n\nFirstly, **be empathetic and invest behind building a people-first culture**.\nAs clich\u00e9 as it may be, it will always be true that a healthy and happy team\nis a productive and successful one.\n\nSecondly, **always make time to listen to everyone who\u2019s in the room** - even\nthe intern. You need to stay open-minded and trust the people you have hired.\nIn a day and age where things are rapidly changing, you will never know where\nthe next big idea is going to come from, and how it can transform your\nbusiness positively.\n\nThirdly, **lead by example**. For example, I had the opportunity to work at\nM&C Saatchi, home to the creative entrepreneurs. While the network has its\nroots in advertising, it has always stood for more than that. It encourages\nits employees to think big, think differently, and it always encourages us to\nshare our ideas and ambitions. Today, M&C Saatchi as a network is proudly home\nto more than 140 offices worldwide which operate in different areas not\nlimited to advertising - we have a business in education, technology and\npatents, filmmaking, art, and more.\n\nCreate Collective is one of them. Many of these companies are started by\nemployees, and the network supports our ideas and ambitions fully \u2013 be it\nbacking us financially or offering us resources from across the network. And\nbecause the network leads by example, it has encouraged me to change my dreams\nfearlessly and inspired my partners and I to step out of our comfort zone and\nstart a new company doing something different with their support. It also made\nus realise that we carry with us a responsibility to bring others along on our\njourney, because of the very same opportunities and support we have received.\n\nLastly, and again, **hire diversely**. Make sure you\u2019re hiring women and\nfocusing on grooming female leaders. Studies and statistics have proven that\ncompanies with an equal balance of men and women senior leaders perform better\nand make more profits.\n\n* * *\n\n_This interview was published in[Human Resources Online\u2019s January-February\n2020 edition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of the Singapore\nmagazine and will soon be published in the Q1 edition of the Malaysia\nmagazine._\n\n[![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/26163836/hrsg_jan_feb20.jpg)](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/)\n\n\n\n_Photo / provided_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

But the spreading disease will change more lives than\nthose of the students departing their residences and classrooms in the coming\ndays. It will affect thousands of faculty and staff members across Harvard.\nThose employees are now hard at work making the switch to distance learning,\nkeeping the University\u2019s labs and health care facilities safe, and ensuring\nthat important services and programs remain available.\n\nTo learn more about what the coming changes are likely to mean for Harvard\u2019s\nemployees moving forward, The Gazette talked with Vice President for Human\nResources Marilyn Hausammann.\n\n## **Q &A**\n\n### Marilyn Hausammann\n\n**GAZETTE:** What can you tell us about the impact of recent events on the\nlarge community of people who keep Harvard up and running every day?\n\n**MARILYN HAUSAMMANN:** First, I\u2019d like to reiterate the words of University\nleadership by saying that the health and well-being of our entire community \u2014\nand that of course includes students, faculty, and staff \u2014 is our main\npriority.\n\nIn HR, our overarching goals are to provide a safe and healthy workplace, and\nto enable Harvard\u2019s mission. Right now, that means mitigation of COVID-19\nthrough a variety of steps that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nand the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are asking all employers to take:\npromoting hygiene, cleaning, having generous and humane policies for paid time\noff, limiting travel, and, increasingly, social distancing. That means\nminimizing and limiting the size of meetings. But we\u2019ve also been planning for\nlarger-scale social distancing by asking everyone to prepare now [to work\nremotely,](https://hr.harvard.edu/flexwork) if their job duties permit it.\n\nWe are incredibly grateful for faculty and staff members who have been working\naround the clock to ensure that the University is able to transition to\nvirtual learning, while remaining open and operational throughout the process.\nIn many ways, we\u2019re in unprecedented territory, and we wouldn\u2019t have been able\nto make this critically important shift without the expertise and hard work of\nour colleagues.\n\n![with Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann.\n](https://news.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MH.jpg)Vice President\nfor Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann. Rose Lincoln/Harvard file photo\n\nThis is a _novel virus,_ and we are constantly integrating new information and\nguidance for employers into our contingency planning. At the same time, we are\ntrying to anticipate the emerging issues and concerns of faculty and staff,\nand to provide practical solutions and responses. To do that, we are in\nregular consultation with the human resource deans and directors in the\nSchools and units across Harvard to determine what kinds of issues we are\nfacing and what kinds of strategies, policies, and information would be most\nhelpful.\n\nAnd while we approach our contingency planning with a \u201cOne Harvard\u201d mindset,\nwe will rely on the good judgment and goodwill of our managers and colleagues\nacross the University. We recognize that there are thousands of different,\nsometimes very hyperlocal situations. For those, we need to rely on the\nexpertise and commitment of managers and staff working together to take care\nof each other, to support the mission, and to protect Harvard\u2019s vital\ncapabilities.\n\n**GAZETTE: **Many people who work at Harvard may be concerned about what it\nmeans for them to stay on campus, while students are being asked to leave.\nWhat can you say to them about this? Have there been discussions about closing\nthe University more broadly?\n\n**HAUSAMMANN:** To begin with, the University\u2019s decision to move to remote\nlearning is designed to keep everyone safer. As my colleague, University\nHealth Services Executive Director [Giang Nguyen, has\nexplained](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/03/officials-detail-\nuniversitys-move-to-online-learning-to-combat-coronavirus/), this decision is\nbased on the public health concept of social distancing, which shows that\nreducing the concentration of people in an area can lower the risk of\ninfection for all involved.\n\nObviously, health and safety measures for the workforce are a bit different\nthan students, as employees do not live together in congregate housing. For\nthe workplace, we are focused on measures that will be most effective, some of\nwhich I\u2019ve just mentioned. If needed, Harvard will take additional steps to\nincrease social distancing, by reducing the density of work spaces in terms of\noccupancy, and, as we are now, encouraging those who can work remotely to be\nprepared to do so.\n\nTo be clear, Harvard would make a specific announcement if and when we were to\nmove to large-scale remote work. That decision has not been made. For now,\npreparing to work remotely should be accelerated where possible and tested to\nmake sure all the technology and connections work. Can you get and respond to\nyour phone calls and email? Can you access your work files? Can you send\nconfidential information using encryption?\n\nAnd it may be that individuals who are more susceptible to complications from\nthe disease will make changes sooner. We\u2019ve asked employees who believe they\nwould benefit from a change in job duties, schedule, or work location to\nconsult with their local HR. And employees who are sick should not come to\nwork.\n\n\"In many ways, we\u2019re in unprecedented territory, and we wouldn\u2019t have been\nable to make this critically important shift without the expertise and hard\nwork of our colleagues.\"\n\n\u2014 Marilyn Hausammann\n\n**GAZETTE: **Should employees be concerned about the status of their jobs?\n\n**HAUSAMMANN: ** Our faculty and staff are needed to fulfill Harvard\u2019s\nmission, even as we shift to distance learning in many of our academic\nprograms. Said another way, the University remains open. Staff should know\nthat the University is committed to sustaining pay continuity for the core\nworkforce \u2014 and by that I mean the non-temporary workforce. People who\ncontinue to work, whether remotely or on campus, will be paid as they are\nnormally. Additionally, Harvard\u2019s regular and [newly expanded workforce\npolicies](https://hr.harvard.edu/corona-virus-workplace-policies) provide many\ndifferent kinds of paid time off. Through these benefits, we ensure the\ncontinuity of pay during illness, self-isolation, quarantine, disability, or\ntimes when dependents need care because they are ill or their care\narrangements have been disrupted. We\u2019ll continue to revisit these commitments\nas the situation evolves.\n\n**GAZETTE:** Can you provide any more advice to employees who may be unsure as\nto how they should approach their decision to come to work?\n\n**HAUSAMMANN: **This is a stressful time for all of us, and since we are in\nuncharted territory, we may feel more anxious than we otherwise would. I hope\nit goes without saying that we encourage and fully support self-care during\nthese times, and encourage people to rely on the many services we offer. They\nare extensive.\n\nIf staff members begin to feel concerned about their health status or the\nhealth status of those who may be close to them, I encourage them to remember\nthat Harvard\u2019s health plans offer comprehensive coverage for both physical and\nmental health care. Employees can also contact the Employee Assistance Program\nat 877-EAP-HARV (877-327-4278) for help with feelings of stress or anxiety\nabout these events.\n\nIf you\u2019re in doubt about whether you should come to work, talk to your\nmanagers. Consult with your own primary care physician if you feel you may be\nexperiencing symptoms.\n\n\n\n### Related\n\n[ ![Annenberg Hall/](https://news.harvard.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Annenberg-V.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1)\n](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/03/officials-detail-universitys-\nmove-to-online-learning-to-combat-coronavirus/)\n\n## [Q&A on Harvard\u2019s move to online\nlearning](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/03/officials-detail-\nuniversitys-move-to-online-learning-to-combat-coronavirus/)\n\nOfficials detail University\u2019s battle plan to combat coronavirus while\neducation continues\n\n[ ![People with packing boxes.](https://news.harvard.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/031020_features_RL_1214.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1)\n](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/03/harvard-offers-coronavirus-\nresources-and-help-guides/)\n\n## [University offers coronavirus resources and help\nguides](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/03/harvard-offers-\ncoronavirus-resources-and-help-guides/)\n\nInformation aims to give students, professors, and staff a hand with moving,\nremote learning, meetings, travel, financial aid, and other issues\n\n\n\n###  Editor's Picks\n\n[ ![Adele Fleet Bacow and President Larry Bacow.](https://news.harvard.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Kenneth-Bacow-\nIMG_1591.00_00_01_01.Still00211.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1)\n](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/04/harvard-president-shares-own-\nexperience-with-covid-19/)\n\n###  [ Campus ](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/section/campus-community/)\n\n##  [ \u2018I thought: This is going to be interesting\u2019\n](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/04/harvard-president-shares-own-\nexperience-with-covid-19/)\n\nPresident Bacow, now recovered, shares own experience having COVID-19\n\n[ ![Joe Allen.](https://news.harvard.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/020918_Allen_1029_2500.jpg?w=500&h=500&crop=1)\n](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/04/how-buildings-masks-can-be-\nbarriers-to-coronavirus/)\n\n###  [ Health ](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/section/health-medicine/)\n\n##  [ How masks and buildings can be barriers to the coronavirus\n](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/04/how-buildings-masks-can-be-\nbarriers-to-coronavirus/)\n\nHealthy buildings expert Joe Allen from the Chan School of Public Health\nweighs in on ways to help protect yourself from coronavirus\n\n[ ![Barbara Oedayrajsingh Varma with Remy the\ncat.](https://news.harvard.edu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Student_Profile_02-1.jpg?w=500&h=500&crop=1)\n](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/04/one-student-adjusts-to-life-\non-campus-another-to-being-home/)\n\n###  [ Campus ](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/section/campus-community/)\n\n##  [ The way we live now\n](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/04/one-student-adjusts-to-life-\non-campus-another-to-being-home/)\n\nOne College student adjusts to life on a deserted campus and another to being\nunexpectedly home a continent away\n\n#### Also in the Series\n\n  1.

USD 6,800 million) to provide relief to construction workers through Direct Benefit Transfer mode.\n  * The EPFO has allowed employees in certain notified areas to access a non-refundable advance from their individual respective provident fund account up to three months\u2019 basic wages and dearness allowance or 75% of the amount available in the employee\u2019s account, whichever is lesser.\n  * The EPFO has relaxed Know Your Customer (\u201cKYC\u201d) verification norms allowing online verification / rectification of Date of birth of Employees\u2019 Provident Fund account holders based on the Date of birth specified in their Aadhaar cards in order to expedite the process of accessing refundable advance made available by way of notification dated March 27, 2020.\n  * The Employees\u2019 State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) has extended the date of statutory insurance contribution by employers for February and March 2020, to April 15, 2020 and May 15, 2020 respectively. \n  * The ESIC has also allowed employers who did not file the relevant statutory contributions for their employees for the period April 2019 to September 2019 to file such contributions until May 15, 2020. \n  * The Indian Ministry of Labour and Employment has extended the last date of filing unified annual returns under eight labour statutes and ten central rules, allowing employers to complete their filings until April 30, 2020 without any consequent penalty. \n  * The Ministry of Labour and Employment has given relaxation to all employers in mines for submission of notices, returns and other forms required under the Mines Act, 1952 and rules and regulations thereunder, for one month from the date of respective due dates for such submissions.\n\nGiven the adverse economic impact due to mandatory lock down imposed by the\nIndian government, more initiatives are expected. As the virus continues to\nspread, the pressure continues to mount. Proprietors and businesses in labour-\nintensive countries like India are already struggling to meet their\nliabilities and obligations towards their workers.\n\nIf the government truly wants employers to comply with its advisories and\nnotifications restricting employers from terminating workers or reducing their\nwages, the government will need to rise up to the challenge. This is the time\nfor innovative relief measures that have a direct and positive impact upon\nemployers, similar to those in Canada, Denmark and Singapore. As it's said, a\nstitch in time saves nine.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Employee

That's the advice of HR technology guru Josh\nBersin._\n\n_We sat down with Bersin, founder of the Josh Bersin Academy, a professional\ndevelopment school for HR, at last week's IamPhenom conference_ _in\nPhiladelphia, held by the talent experience software provider Phenom._\n\n_Here, Bersin discusses how HR and IT should deal with the exponentially\ngrowing HR technology landscape and whether technology is actually the key to\na great employee experience._\n\n**In terms of the HR technology buying team, how would you characterize\ncollaboration between HR and IT teams?**\n\nJosh Bersin: It's complicated. We're at a stage of the [HR tech\nmarket](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Top-7-HR-trends-\nfor-2020-and-beyond-The-change-decade) where there's way too many tools. It's\nout of control. HR needs IT so that IT can put together an architectural\nstrategy for all these tools. We can call it part of the employee experience\nor the talent experience. We don't want the employees to have to log into 15\ndifferent things or download different apps to use all of our HR systems. We\nwant [things like] single sign-on and security. We have GDPR, we want to make\nsure the [data's\nconsistent](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/5-barriers-to-\ncreating-data-driven-HR-and-how-to-overcome-them), and we don't have different\ndata elements being collected in different places or replicated data in\ndifferent places. And all these tools have AI so they're all intelligent data\ncollection systems on their own.\n\n![Josh Bersin](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/bersin_josh.jpg)\n\nSo, the IT people are getting more involved than ever. IT departments need to\nbe much more like systems integrators and really look at how these things are\ngoing to fit together and slow down the buying.\n\n**How can IT help HR leaders address the tech overload?**\n\nBersin: The new model is starting to evolve to be like the iPhone -- you can\nfind any app you like, download it, run it and then delete it if you don't\nlike it. That's really where IT needs to go. Companies have to figure out some\nform of plug-and-play strategy.\n\nMore of the vendors are building interfaces to the big HR platforms, and some\nof the big vendors like Oracle, SAP, Workday, ServiceNow and ADP are becoming\nmore integration platforms. So, if you're an ADP customer, if you're a Workday\ncustomer, there are tools [from other vendors] that have been [preset for\nintegration]. You can just select from that list so they're kind of\necosystems.\n\n> Focus on the employee experience and the big problems before [you] go out\n> and buy all the tools.  **Josh Bersin** Founder, Josh Bersin Academy  __\n\nBut a lot of companies have multiple geographies; they go through\nacquisitions; they actually have five HR systems, [for example]. So, vendors\nlike IBM and some of the big integrators are now spending a lot of time\nhelping companies connect all these things together because there's not one\neasy plug-and-play architecture yet. We've reached that stage where\n[integration and ease of\nuse](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Three-truths-about-\nintegrated-HR-systems-IT-and-HR-should-know) is more important than a really\ncool feature that was built from a vendor we'd kind of like to have.\n\n**HR leaders are being told they need all these exciting or new technologies.\nWhat's your advice for them?**\n\nBersin: HR leaders need to make sure they slow down the process a little bit\nand focus on the employee experience and the big problems before they go out\nand buy all the tools.\n\nLet's suppose we want to have a well-being app --\n[mindfulness](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Secrets-of-tech-\nenabled-workplace-mindfulness-programs), exercise, fitness, diet -- there's a\nmillion of those. But HR leaders need to consider:\n\n  * How are employees going to get to it?\n  * How are they going to log into it?\n  * What platforms are they going to build around it?\n  * Is the IT department going to support it?\n  * What versions of the operating system will it run in?\n  * Where will the data go?\n  * Who's going to secure the data?\n  * How much of the data is even legal for us to even look at?\n\nSo, more of these decisions have to get slowed down and reviewed by IT. Good\nHR departments have an [HR tech committee](https://www.gruppomarcucci-\nusa.com/news/engage-employees-to-make-your-hr-technology-more-productive/) and\nit includes the buyers, the specialists who need to know what the products do\nand then somebody in IT, and somebody in the data -- and sometimes there's an\nanalytics group -- and they all work together. They look at the options and\nthey make sure the pieces fit and form a reasonable architecture.\n\n**What tools should they tackle first, especially as it relates to employee\nexperience?**\n\nBersin: You have to know how the company is doing it today. So, for example,\nif you're shopping for a new recruiting system, all the critical stakeholders\nshould come together to discuss it. And some of them are going to get excited\nabout a lot of things. But you need to get under the covers of that and look\nat what [core technology](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/8-HR-\ntechnology-trends-CHROs-should-investigate-in-2020) you already have. You have\nto do [a request for proposal] from the standpoint of the purchasing\ndepartment, but that doesn't tell you that much. What you really need to do is\npick a product you like and then pilot with a small number of people and see\nhow well it works.\n\n__Josh Bersin discusses the true meaning of employee experience at the\nIamPhenom conference.\n\n__\n\n**A lot of vendors are selling tools as the key to the employee experience.\nWhat do you think of that?**\n\nBersin: Vendors have oversold HR technology as the key to employee experience.\nIf what you had was bad or you didn't have anything, technology can help.\nEverybody gets very excited about the technology.\n\nThe more important things at work are the work itself, the managers, the way\nyou treat employees, the pay, the sense of fairness, the sense of inclusion\n[and] employees' opportunity to grow. Those are the things that really drive\nthe employee experience. The software doesn't do that.\n\n#### __Next Steps\n\n[Does AI belong in HR?](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/opinion/How-\nwill-AI-in-HR-be-a-game-changer)\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on HR systems and HCM software\n\n  * [\n\n##### Transformational HR in 2020: 7 strategies for agility and tech mastery\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/daniel_diann.jpg) By: Diann\nDaniel ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Transformational-HR-\nin-2020-7-strategies-for-agility-and-tech-mastery)\n\n  * [\n\n##### IT's technology experience problem gets HR tool\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252475127/ITs-technology-\nexperience-problem-gets-HR-tool)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Employee engagement in HR shapes performance and payroll tech\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/wallask_scott.jpg) By: Scott\nWallask ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Employee-engagement-\nin-HR-shapes-performance-and-payroll-tech)\n\n  * [\n\n##### SAP CX move with Qualtrics challenges Salesforce, Oracle\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/scardina_jesse.jpg) By: Jesse\nScardina ](https://searchcustomerexperience.techtarget.com/news/252452489/SAP-\nCX-move-with-Qualtrics-challenges-Salesforce-Oracle)\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [How IT and HR can Partner to Deliver a Better Employee Experience](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/How-IT-and-HR-can-Partner-to-Deliver-a-Better-Employee-Experience) -Citrix\n  * [Want Engaged and Inspired Employees?

The need for advice from OH doctors, nurses, physiotherapists,\npsychologists, hygienists, and ergonomists amongst other professional groups\nis required. The need to protect our workers has never been greater;\nprotecting the workforce is the core role of OH.\n\n\u201cSOM is supporting a multidisciplinary drive across sectors to raise\nawareness, share knowledge and engage employees in solutions. It is\nencouraging workplaces to design-in exposure prevention measures as advised by\nthe Health and Safety Executive \u2013 helping employees take the opportunity to\nbetter understand the risks and demonstrate good practice in their work.\u201d\n\nThe organisation also welcomed the Health and Safety Executive\u2019s announcement\nthat dangerous activity or work exposure to Covid-19 is reportable under\nRIDDOR. HSE also said doctors have an obligation to notify HM Coroner, or the\nProcurator Fiscal if in Scotland, if they suspect a Covid-19 death is work-\nrelated.\n\nMeanwhile, two-thirds of doctors who participated in a British Medical\nAssociation survey said they do not feel safely protected from coronavirus\ninfection at work.\n\nAccording to the survey of almost 2,000 doctors, more than half working in\nhigh-risk environments said there were either shortages of adequate face\nmasks, or none at all, while 65% did not have suitable eye protection.\n\nAlarmingly, 55% felt pressurised to work in a high-risk area despite not\nhaving adequate PPE.\n\nOne hospital doctor told the BMA: \u201cThe quality of our eye protection and apron\nis useless. Some of the PPE provided feels like a tick-box exercise just for\npsychological reassurance.\u201d\n\nOnly 195 said they had access to Covid-19 tests, despite the government\nstating it was increasing testing of healthcare workers.\n\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the BMA, said: \"We are weeks into the most serious\nhealth crisis this country has faced in modern times and doctors are telling\nus they don\u2019t have any or don\u2019t have enough protective equipment. Until now,\nwe have been hearing anecdotal stories about shortages or a lack of PPE, this\nsurvey confirms the extent of this failure.\"\n\n[Previous

Check it out: https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/access-\ndevelop-payroll-solution-with-corehr-takeover/) __\n\nThe Access Group has acquired CoreHR, an Ireland and U.K.-based firm known for\nHR and payroll software, according to a[press\nrelease](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200305005057/en/Access-\nAcquires-CoreHR-Create-Access-People-UK).\n\nThe move sets up Access Group to become a large-sized leader in the region for\nthose types of services. It follows Access Group\u2019s other recent acquisition of\nPeople, another leader in small business HR software.\n\nBoth of those acquisitions, the release states, will allow Access Group to\nsupport businesses of any size with needs for HR and payroll-related issues.\n\nCoreHR\u2019s software currently serves more than 270 customers, with more than 1\nmillion users accessing its services. The group sees a strong presence across\nfields like government, education, retail, hospitality, leisure, distribution\nand manufacturing, among others.\n\nIt covers people management, payroll, workforce management, recruitment,\ntalent management and more.\n\nGoing forward, those needs will be a part of the Access Workspace platform,\nwith the needs supported as part of the cloud-based system, delivering\nservices that foster communication and collaboration in the workplace,\naccording to the press release.\n\nAccess Group has a dominant foothold in the sector in the U.K. and Ireland,\nboasting revenues in this sector of over 100 million pounds ($129.6 million).\nThe combination of the company\u2019s new assets will result in the formation of\nthe Access People Division. Dean Forbes, currently the CEO of CoreHR, will\nbecome the president of that division.\n\nForbes said in the release that meeting Access Group\u2019s leaders persuaded\nCoreHR that the acquisition would be the best way forward for customers as the\ncompany continues to grow. Forbes said Access Group would be \u201cfully committed\u201d\nto helping enhance the range and depth of CoreHR\u2019s products.\n\nOther recent acquisitions for Access Group, including payroll technology firm\n[Payroll Service\nCompany](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/access-acquisitions-\nbroaden-payroll-software-footprint/), also helped the company bolster its\nservices. Access pointed to a rapidly changing payroll market as a driver\nbehind the takeovers. It said the change is driven by challenges in talent\nattraction, retention and engagement.\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

Webber](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/author/ashleighwight/\n\"Posts by Ashleigh Webber\") on 27 Mar 2020 in [HR\ntransformation](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr-strategy/hr-transformation-\nhr-strategy/), [Learning

Shutterstock\n\n**As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to grip the UK, technology has had a\ndominant role in enabling thousands of organisations to shift to a home\nworking model in the past couple of weeks \u2013 almost overnight, in some cases.**\n\nWith working from home becoming \"the new normal\", software companies have\nreported a major increase in demand for services such as video job interviews,\nonline learning and video conferencing.\n\n## Business continuity\n\n**[Handling an acquisition during the coronavirus\ncrisis](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/coping-with-coronavirus-during-a-\nmerger/)**\n\n**[Working from home: How HR can deal with the daily\ndilemmas](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/remote-working-how-hr-can-deal-\nwith-the-daily-dilemmas/)**\n\nAnd as swathes of organisations look to cut costs and reduce headcount to keep\ntheir business afloat during the crisis, the technology sector's role in\nkeeping the economy functioning is reflected in the number of people it is\nlooking to hire. According to recruitment firm Robert Walters UK, permanent\njob vacancies in the tech sector increased by 32.56% in the first quarter of\n2020, and contract roles increased by 48.27% when compared with the same\nperiod last year.\n\nBut the disruption caused by the coronavirus is presenting an opportunity for\nemployers to think about how they can become more agile, suggests David\nWilson, CEO at HR technology analyst Fosway. He says that while many employers\nwere aware of the need to digitalise their systems before the virus hit, they\nhad been slow to adapt. This has perhaps made the shift to remote working more\ndifficult.\n\n\u201cThe new normal after [the Covid-19 lockdown] won\u2019t be the same as the normal\nwe once knew. I think it\u2019s going to encourage change; from an HR point of\nview, this will mean becoming more agile, becoming more digital,\u201d he tells\nPersonnel Today.\n\n\u201cThe challenges organisations have around the lack of skills and their\ninability to hire people are still going to be there like they were before,\nbut they\u2019re likely to have been brought even more to the fore now. Technology\nwill have a role in helping to solve these problems.\u201d\n\n## 'Huge opportunity'\n\nAside from key workers, most employees will currently be working from home, so\norganisations will probably have some form of remote working technology in\nplace. But being able to manage people effectively and \u201cget stuff done\u201d will\nbe a critical problem for them.\n\n\u201cArguably people aren\u2019t spending so much time in meetings, and they have the\npotential to use this time in a positive way. There\u2019s a huge opportunity to\nuse it for development and learning, for example. And it\u2019s all got to be done\nonline \u2013 via video, virtual meetings \u2013 all of that has now become the only\nroute to market,\u201d says Wilson.\n\n\u201cThe level of change within companies to become more agile and digital is\ngoing to become a non-negotiable now. It pretty much was anyway, but HR has\nparticularly been a laggard function.\n\n\u201cThe majority of organisations are still largely transactional \u2013 sometimes\nit\u2019s really hard to cut through that and become more transformational. But now\nwe\u2019re in unparalleled times where being able to respond quickly is non-\nnegotiable.\u201d\n\nWhile the coronavirus will undoubtedly put growth activity on hold for many\norganisations, the HR technology space could actually be preparing for a huge\nincrease in activity, suggests Wilson.\n\nBefore the nation went on lockdown, three major acquisition deals were\nannounced: Kronos and Ultimate Software; Cornerstone and Saba; and, more\nrecently, Access Group and CoreHR.\n\nWhile it is likely that any further announcements will be put on hold as\ncompanies adjust to the \u201cnew normal\u201d, Wilson believes the time is right for\nmore consolidation in the HR tech space, with potentially more acquisition\nactivity to come later in the year.\n\n## HR tech mergers\n\n**[Kronos and Ultimate Software merge to form HR systems\ngiant](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/kronos-and-ultimate-software-merge-\nto-form-hr-systems-giant/)**\n\n**[Cornerstone to acquire Saba in $1.4bn\ndeal](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/cornerstone-saba/)**\n\n**[Access Group buys CoreHR to form Access\nPeople](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/access-group-corehr-deal/)**\n\n\u201cCovid-19 has done two things: one is share prices and financial markets have\nbeen massively impacted, so if you\u2019re a public company your share price has\ndropped from anywhere between 30% and 80%. This makes organisations bigger\ntargets for companies sitting on a pile of cash at the moment, as they are now\nsubstantially cheaper to buy than they would\u2019ve been,\u201d explains Wilson.\n\n\u201cSecondly, Covid-19 has also created huge market uncertainty, but we will\nprobably see more acquisition activity in the second half of the year just\nbecause of the impact of the financial change. We know that there are other\npeople who are shopping.\u201d\n\n## Bringing talent benefits\n\nAside from the potential for businesses with large cash reserves to take\nadvantage of the growth opportunity, technology companies are turning to\nacquisition to bring new talent on board and quickly fill any skills gaps.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only a finite amount of talent in the market,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cOne of\nthe things that wasn\u2019t too explicit in the Cornerstone deal was that they had\nthings they wanted to do but they couldn\u2019t recruit the skills they needed into\nthe development team fast enough. By buying Saba they have been able to\nleverage their talent and it has enabled them to be more progressive and to\npursue their innovation plans.\u201d\n\nAlso, HR tech firms are looking for merger or acquisition opportunities to\naccess new markets or sectors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more consolidation across all the markets we track \u2013\nrecruitment, HR and learning and development,\u201d says Wilson.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also seeing many new start-ups. We track hundreds of companies across\nthe market sectors we monitor and I would say that for every one acquisition\nthere\u2019s five to ten start-ups, or organisations that are established players\nwho are only in one market and are looking to become pan-European or global.\u201d\n\nWith normal operations unlikely to resume any time soon, technology will\ncontinue to play a major role in keeping business operational \u2013 and may have a\nlasting effect on working practices once the coronavirus crisis is over.\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/chancellor-set-to-to-\nunveil-self-employed-support/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/testing-times-how-\noccupational-health-is-responding-to-coronavirus/)\n\n##### No comments yet.\n\n### Leave a Reply [Click here to cancel reply.](/hr/is-the-coronavirus-\npresenting-opportunities-for-tech-companies/#respond)\n\nComment\n\nName (required)\n\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\n\nWebsite\n\n### Related posts:\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/03/Dean-\nForbes-CEO-CoreHR-3.jpg)Access Group buys CoreHR to form Access\nPeople](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/access-group-corehr-deal/ \"Access\nGroup buys CoreHR to form Access People\")\n\nHR software provider Access Group has acquired CoreHR to create Access People,\nin the latest in a string of HR...\n\n[ ![data analysis](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/06/data-shutterstock_574107052.jpg)'HR held back\nby failure to use data effectively'](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/hr-\nheld-back-by-failure-to-use-data-effectively/ \"\u2018HR held back by failure to use\ndata effectively\u2019\")\n\nHalf of UK organisations rely on instinct and gut feel when it comes to\nassessing skills despite need to analyse data.\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/11/Sage_People_featured___.jpg)Goodbye HR, hello\n\u2018People\u2019 \u2013 Download the Changing Face of HR\nreport](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/changing-face-of-hr-report-sage-\npeople/ \"Goodbye HR, hello \u2018People\u2019 \u2013 Download the Changing Face of HR\nreport\")\n\n**PROMOTED |** How far are you in your HR to People journey?

employers?\n\n![](https://www.igamingbusiness.com/sites/default/files/styles/300x250/public/Cara%20Kerr%20copy.jpg?itok=PO_2gaDm)\n\n# Covid 19: what next for igaming employers?\n\n7 April 2020\n\n **Recruitment may not be the first item on the agena for employers at the\nmoment but for those in a position to take a long-term approach, the market\nhas resoundingly turned in their favour, writes Cara Kerr**\n\nWho can tell what the next few months will bring? For HRs and business\nleaders, the future is about as uncertain as it\u2019s ever been.\n\nPriority, quite rightly, has first been placed on protecting workers amidst\noften significant threats to business, and thankfully many thousands of\nindustry jobs have been saved worldwide. But what comes next?\n\nRecruitment may not be the first item on an igaming employers\u2019 agenda. In\nfact, recruitment freezes or delayed processes have already slowed the market\nconsiderably.\n\nAs we consider the path ahead, though, two factors will play an important role\nin bringing recruitment plans back to the forefront:\n\n  1. **Business must go on.** Even despite the widespread \u2018shutdowns\u2019 to daily life worldwide, the usual evolution of careers and companies continues, and employers will still need to hire new people where they are required to keep operations going, and growing.\n  2. **High-skilled candidates** **are now available for hire.** The circumstances are clearly far from ideal, but the \u2018talent market\u2019 has now swung in employers\u2019 favour. After years where employers have struggled to fill many specialist roles, now could even present something of an opportunity. \"The most far sighted HR-ers are already looking beyond the flattened curve,\" according to The Economist last week. \"For a savvy HR chief it's the perfect opportunity.\"\n\nThe igaming sector, we firmly believe, has the creativity, resilience and core\nstrength to weather this storm.\n\nWe\u2019ve already been heartened to see many employers committed to not only their\nexisting staff, but also extending opportunities to new candidates.\n\nPeople \u2013 good people \u2013 will be critical if the industry is to come out of this\nstronger.\n\n**The challenges: remote-ness and reductions**  \nIt is without doubt that the challenges this market presents for employers in\nevery sector, including igaming, are great.\n\nHR bosses and business leaders will be focusing on:\n\n  * Prioritising existing employees\u2019 jobs\n  * Maintaining the strongest possible staff base for current and future circumstances\n  * Enabling all possible operations to continue on a remote, working-from-home, basis\n  * Conducting full recruitment processes online\n\nUltimately, the challenge of preserving existing employees\u2019 jobs takes\nabsolute priority.\n\nThis has been the focus of businesses so far, with many introducing\nsignificant measures \u2013 including the foregoing of bonuses, temporary\nfurloughing and salary reductions \u2013 to avoid making workforce reductions.\n\nPractically, too, HR bosses and business leaders are rapidly adapting to\nconducting entire operations on a remote basis. Some businesses are more\nadaptable than others to this way of working, but even those for whom \u2018remote-\nonly\u2019 is possible in theory must ensure that communications, team unity and\nproductivity remain carefully managed.\n\nInterview processes for new positions will, for the time being, need to be\nconducted entirely by video link. Whilst for many (mostly tech and sales) this\nis nothing new, running full hiring processes in this manner will require a\nleap of faith for some.\n\n**The opportunity: hire top talent now**  \nIt may sound counter-intuitive, but for those in a position to take a long-\nterm approach, now is truly a strategic opportunity to hire and grow.\n\nFor years, demand for talent has far outstripped supply and employers have\nfought hard to attract staff and grow teams.\n\nNow though (through circumstances self-evidently far from ideal), the market\nhas resoundingly turned: job vacancies are now significantly outnumbered by\navailable candidates.\n\nFor those who can make the stretch, this \"employer's market\" for talent offers\nan unseen-in-recent-times opportunity to make world-class hires.\n\nTo summarise the current opportunities for employers:\n\n  * Availability of talent across the board has increased, creating significantly more choice for employers.\n  * Hard-to-fill roles (such as those requiring specialist skills or languages) will now become easier to source for. The best candidates won\u2019t be immediately on the market, but may be more open to considering something new, given the circumstances.\n  * Remote workers - such as those in tech and sales - can be hired for roles now regardless of location. Even after this crisis lifts, work can still be conducted remotely.\n  * Entire new functions of businesses are rapidly adapting to remote working practices. This change needn't be temporary, so employers could benefit from hiring remote staff, thereby overcoming previous geographical barriers to hiring.\n  * World-class leadership talent with specialist industry experience (a rare find in normal times) will become available for hire.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s also easier than ever to arrange confidential discussions with\ncandidates, who are \u2013 by necessity \u2013 largely working from home, away from\ncolleagues and bosses.\n\n_**Cara Kerr** is head of Europe for Pentasia, where she leads the sales team\nand oversees strategy for the gambling recruitment specialist on the\ncontinent.

But when it\ncomes to our time, we hardly give it a second thought. The good news is that\nthere are easy ways to take some of your time back. Process-oriented tasks\nthat can't be automated should at the very least be delegated or outsourced.\nIf it's a low-risk, repeatable, non-complex task that somebody else can do for\nyou at fraction of what your hourly rate is, why are you still doing it? Most\ndecisions are reversible and should be made quickly. If it's not necessary to\nhave a meeting (it's usually not), use asynchronous communication tools; the\nreality is that most things don't require an immediate response. While you'll\ninitially have to spend some time to make time, like compound interest, over\nthe long-term, you will save exponentially more time than you invest.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/04/Apr20_07_678756706.jpg)\nMirageC/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/04/productivity-skills-to-help-you-gain-time-\nback?language=es)\n\nWe\u2019re all busy \u2014 so busy. We have bills to pay, a mortgage to service, kids to\ntake care of, and of course, work deadlines to meet. All of these commitments\nleave us with little meaningful time for ourselves, and for cultivating\nmeaningful relationships with others. But the good news is: When we say we\u2019re\ntime-poor, what we really mean is that we\u2019re decision-poor. And that\u2019s\nsomething we can change.\n\nMost of us are incredibly careful about how we spend our money. But when it\ncomes to our time, we hardly give it a second thought. We say yes to all sorts\nof nonsensical requests for our time; we treat everything as urgent; we attend\npointless meetings; we refuse to delegate work for fear that quality will be\ncompromised; we spend our days tethered to our inboxes and our smartphones;\nand we stubbornly continue to perform tasks that a machine could do for us.\n\nUnlike money though, time can\u2019t be earned back.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to derive a sense of identity or status from the hustle, but what\u2019s\nit ultimately for? As palliative care nurse Bronnie Ware noted in her book,\n_[The Top Five Regrets of the Dying](https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-\nthe-dying/)_ , one of the biggest regrets that people had on their deathbeds\nwas that they\u2019d worked too hard.\n\n#### Insight Center\n\n  * ###### [The Era of Job Crafting](/insight-center/the-era-of-job-crafting)\n\nSponsored by Upwork\n\nDesign the work you want.\n\nStep one toward joining the new rich \u2014 those who use their time wisely, and\nthus have the luxury of more free time \u2014 is believing in the paradox that we\ncan actually get _more_ done in _less_ time, as I wrote in \u201c[The Case for the\n6-Hour Workday](/2018/12/the-case-for-the-6-hour-workday).\u201d Refusing to\nbelieve this is to resign yourself to a life of staring at screens for [eleven\nhours a day](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/staring-down-the-dangers-\nof-the-digital-workplace/). It\u2019s your choice.\n\nIf you choose to take back your time, here\u2019s how to get started:\n\n### **1\\. Automate**\n\nNowadays, all kinds of tasks can be automated. Sadly, too few entrepreneurs\nand business executives are taking advantage of the multitude of affordable\nand simple, yet effective, tools on the market.\n\nHere\u2019s a non-exhaustive snapshot of what can be automated:\n\n  * Legal: Data mining, contract review\n  * Sales: Lead generation, lead nurturing, proposal development, meeting preparation, customer intelligence, competitor intelligence\n  * Marketing: Email templates and marketing content syndication, content repurposing, content distribution\n  * IT: Data backups, network management, PC maintenance, account creation, file transfers, data extraction\n  * HR: Payroll scheduling, candidate recruiting\n  * Development/programming: Scripts to copy files and perform repetitive actions, the optimization of images\n  * Customer support: Surveys and questionnaires, customer inquiries\n\nTools you can start using today:\n\n  * Workflow management: Zapier.com, IFTTT.com\n  * Posting to social media: Buffer and HootSuite\n  * Appointment scheduling: Calendly.com\n  * Repurposing content: Repurpose.io\n\n### **2\\. Outsource  **\n\nProcess-oriented tasks that can\u2019t be automated should at the very least be\ndelegated or outsourced. If it\u2019s a low-risk, repeatable, non-complex task that\nsomebody else can do for you at fraction of what your hourly rate is, why are\nyou still doing it?\n\nIn an [episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qHkcs3kG44) of the popular\nJoe Rogan Experience podcast, AngelList founder Naval Ravikant suggested\nsetting an aspirational hourly rate for yourself and sticking to it. \u201cNever do\nanything with your time for less than that amount \u2014 whether it\u2019s attending a\nmeeting or returning a package from Amazon\u2026If I have to return something, and\nit costs less than my personal hourly rate, I\u2019ll give it away.\u201d\n\nHaving worked with hundreds of entrepreneurs, I often show them the table\nbelow, created by author Perry Marshall, and ask, \u201cWhat percentage of your\ntime do you spend on $10-an-hour tasks?\u201d\n\n#### Is Your Work Worth $10 an Hour or $10,000 an Hour?\n\nHow are you really spending your time?  \n---  \n**$10 per hour tasks** | **$100 per hour tasks** | **$1,000 per hour tasks** |\n**$10,000 per hour tasks**  \nRunning errands | Solving a problem for a prospective or existing customer |\nPlanning and prioritizing your day | Improving your unique selling proposition  \nTalking to unqualified prospects | Talking to a qualified prospect |\nNegotiating with a qualified prospect | Creating new and better offers  \nCold-calling | Writing an email to prospects or customers | Building your\nsales funnel | Repositioning your message and position  \nBuilding and fixing stuff on your website | Creating marketing tests and\nexperiments | Judging marketing tests and experiments | Executing \u201cbolt from\nthe blue\u201d brilliant ideas  \nDoing expense reports | Managing pay-per-click campaigns | Creating pay-per-\nclick campaigns | Negotiating major deals  \nWorking \u201csocial media\u201d the way most people do | Doing social media well (this\nis rare) | Doing social media with extreme competence (this is very rare) |\nSelling to high-value customers and groups  \nCleaning, sorting | Outsourcing simple tasks | Delegating complex tasks |\nSelecting team members  \nAttending meetings | Customer follow up | Writing sales copy | Public speaking  \nSource: \u201c80/20 Sales and Marketing,\u201d by Perry Marshall | (C) HBR.org  \n  \n\u201cAbout half my time\u201d is the usual response. When I press people to outsource,\nthey respond without a hint of irony: \u201cI don\u2019t have time to do that!\u201d\n\nYou have to spend time to make time, but like compound interest, in the long-\nterm, you will save exponentially more time than you invest.\n\n\u201cBut it only takes me a few minutes a day to do it!\u201d Even a task that takes\nyou 5 minutes a day, 5 times a day, adds up to 15 workdays per year, not even\naccounting for the cognitive switching costs.\n\nTo outsource more low-value tasks, try tools such as:\n\n  * Day-to-day errands: GetMagic.com, TaskRabbit.com\n  * Creative tasks and virtual assistants: Upwork.com, Freelancer.com\n\n### **3\\. Use asynchronous communication**\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a necessary evil.\u201d These were the words of a former manager of mine at a\nleading Australian bank.\n\nI had asked why 12 people had to be present for periodic three-hours-long\nmeeting when 10 of them each had no more than five minutes of worthwhile\ncontributions to make.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a necessary evil, it was just inefficient and unproductive.\n\nThis lack of ownership, and tendency to outsource accountability by way of\nmulti-person, multi-hours-long meetings and reply-all email trails leaves\ncompany productivity stagnant and employee morale low.\n\nA better approach is the \u201cI\u2019ll get to it when it suits me\u201d philosophy that is\nat the core of asynchronous communication. The reality is that most things\ndon\u2019t require an immediate response, and that meetings shouldn\u2019t be used\nmerely to communicate information; we have email and instant messaging for\nthat.\n\nIf a discussion is warranted, then try scheduling shorter meetings, in 15- or\n30-minute increments, instead of the obligatory hour which is still the\ndefault at most organizations today. And if it\u2019s not necessary to have a\nmeeting (it\u2019s usually not), try one of these asynchronous communication tools:\n\n  * Instant message: Slack, Facebook Workplace, Microsoft Teams\n  * Project management: Asana, Trello, Basecamp, Airtable\n  * Pausing email and websites: Inbox Pause, Blocksite\n\n### **4\\. Stop treating all decisions like big decisions**\n\nIt\u2019s hard to talk about asynchronous communication without referring to what\nAmazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos calls [Type 1 and Type 2\ndecisions](https://media.corporate-\nir.net/media_files/irol/97/97664/reports/Shareholderletter97.pdf): Type 1\ndecisions are big, hairy, irreversible, and high-stakes. Type 2 decisions are\nreversible. If you screw up, you can make amends without too much, if any,\nharm having been caused.\n\nMost of our decisions are Type 2 decisions, and they should be made quickly.\nThe fewer decisions that are treated as Type 1 decisions, the less time will\nget eaten up with meetings and communications.\n\n### **5\\. Try task bundling**\n\nMulti-tasking is a myth, and [task-switching leaves us unproductive and\nexhausted](https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask), but that doesn\u2019t\nmean that we can\u2019t bundle tasks.\n\nKatherine Milkman, a behavioral economist at the Wharton School of the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, coined the term \u201c[temptation\nbundling](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4381662/).\u201d It refers\nto bundling things you want to do with things you need to do, to help you\nbuild positive habits.\n\nLet\u2019s say my physiotherapist asked me to incorporate 30 minutes of mobility\ntraining into my day, three times a week. I could do this in isolation, or I\ncould combine it with something I want to do like watching a documentary on\nYouTube, or even taking a call on speaker.\n\nBy making fewer excuses, and investing the time required to design our work\nand personal lives, not only can we join the new rich, but we can cultivate a\nmore meaningful and less regrettable life.\n\nAs Roman Stoic philosopher [Seneca

vendors\n\nby [MSDW Reporter](/author/msdw-editorial-team)\n\nEditorial Team, MSDynamicsWorld.com\n\nOctober 3 2019\n\n![](https://msdynamicsworld.com/sites/default/files/talent-core-hr-\nicon.png)Microsoft has acquired the rights to advanced HR tools from two\nvendors, FourVision and Elevate HR, for use as part of the core HR module\nwithin Dynamics 365 Talent.\n\nThe new capabilities cover leave and absence, time and attendance, and\nbenefits, according to an\n[announcement](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2019/10/02/strategic-\ninvestments-in-core-hr-drive-operational-excellence/) from Dynamics 365\ngeneral manager Muhammad Alam.\n\nThe core HR capabilities (previously referred to as \"core HCM\") within\nDynamics 365 Talent work against the Common Data Service and are designed to\nintegrate with Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management\n(formerly Finance and Operations). [Talent also offers modular\napps](https://msdynamicsworld.com/story/microsoft-launches-\ndynamics-365-recruiting-onboarding-apps-building-out-modular-approach) like\nOnboard and the LinkedIn Recruiter-integrated\n[Attract](https://msdynamicsworld.com/story/microsoft-dynamics-365-talent-\nattract-app-fully-integrated-linkedin-recruiter) (other apps have been\npreviewed, like\n[Gauge](https://msdynamicsworld.com/story/dynamics-365/microsoft-\ndynamics-365-talent-adds-tech-preview-gauge-online-skills-assessment)).\n\nAlam emphasized that Microsoft customers are adding Talent's core HR\ncapabilities to their Dynamics 365 ERP solutions. He stated that the \"usage\"\nof Talent's core HR capabilities is doubling every six months.\n\nDynamics 365 for Talent core HR will be adding FourVision's leave and absence,\nsickness management, and timesheet capabilities.\n\n### FREE Membership Required to View Full Content:\n\n[Become a\nMember](/user/register?msg=1&destination=node/28074)[Login](/user/login?destination=node/28074)\n\nJoining MSDynamicsWorld.com gives you **free, unlimited access** to news,\nanalysis, white papers, case studies, product brochures, and more.

user\npwainewright](/sites/default/files/styles/user_avatar/public/user/2019-02/pwainewright.jpeg?itok=E2UQQ7uW)\nBy [Phil Wainewright](/author/pwainewright \"View user profile.\") December 20,\n2019\n\nSummary:\n\n     Best-of-breed absence management vendor E-Days has discovered the complexity of time off that enterprise HR systems don't address \n\n__\n\n![Business chair with out of office sign absence time off \u00a9 Brian A Jackson -\nshutterstock](/sites/default/files/styles/article_images_desktop/public/images/2019-12/shutterstock-\nBrian-A-Jackson-644195599.jpg?itok=DlOESFF9)\n\nWith many people taking time off during the holiday season \u2014 whether as paid\ntime off or as sick leave \u2014 absence management is front-of-mind for HR staff.\nCore HR systems ought to automate all of these processes, but most fall\nsurprisingly short, as the founders of E-Days discovered when they brought an\nonline absence management tool to market at the turn of the decade. It soon\nbecame apparent that mainstream HR vendors were not building the absence\nmanagement functionality that enterprises need, says CEO Steve Arnold:\n\n> They hadn't put enough effort into this area of HR technology \u2014 and it\n> opened our eyes to the complexity out there in absence management.\n\nThere are many different rules across different geographies and industries,\nand many different ways a company might choose to observe those rules. As well\nas paid and unpaid time off, there are often complex rules around statutory\nsick leave and parental leave. Then the resulting pay implications have to be\nfed back into payroll systems. This demands a best-of-breed solution, says\nArnold.\n\n> We discovered this was such a challenging area it lent itself to a very\n> focused approach.\n\nE-Days had started out as just one of a portfolio of speculative SaaS\napplications built by Arnold's web development business, but it quickly gained\nmomentum. Although it had initially targeted smaller businesses, larger\ncompanies started asking about the product and the team began adding\ncapabilities to meet their needs. Its global reach began to expand as\ncustomers requested new countries, says Arnold:\n\n> The key to our story was we started listening to customers. If someone\n> wanted us to support absence management in Hong Kong for example, we'd ask\n> what are the rules. We knew if we could tackle a location, the next company\n> that came along with a presence there, we'd have a solution for them.\n\nToday the company boasts more than 1,500 customers, ranging in size from 30-40\nemployees at the low end up to as many as 25,000 or more. The [customer roster\nincludes](https://www.e-days.com/customers) large enterprises such as AXA,\nBarclays, Canon, M&G, Monster Energy, Prudential, Sony Pictures, law firms\nDentons and Sidley Austin, and public sector organizations such as the British\nStandards Institute and Health and Safety Executive.\n\nLast month E-Days announced a strategic partnership to became the preferred\nabsence management solution for Cornerstone OnDemand's HCM solution. It's a\nfurther demonstration of the value of a best-of-breed offering for absence\nmanagement, says Arnold:\n\n> The difference with E-Days is we can configure E-Days to suit all these\n> different companies throughout their locations. That flexibility just is not\n> there with the HR systems.\n\n## 'Absence management is like an iceberg'\n\nThis singular focus on absence management allows E-Days to go beyond process\nautomation and rules administration to deal with other issues related to\nabsence. Arnold explains:\n\n> Absence management is like an iceberg. You see the challenges of managing\n> the admin of absence management, but the bigger problems are lurking beneath\n> the surface \u2014 managing talent and proactively managing employee wellbeing,\n> getting accurate data to payroll, protecting sensitive data \u2014 all those\n> problems lurk beneath the surface.\n\nOne area of innovation is to become more proactive in how the app responds to\nabsence incidents. For example, it now incorporates wellbeing advice and the\nability to book a virtual consultation with a physician within a half hour of\nmaking the request, which can either help an employee get treatment when\nthey're off sick, or even forestall an absence by providing treatment before\nthe condition worsens.\n\nWhen an employee enters information to notify a sick leave absence, the app\ndisplays help data based on the keywords being entered, and alerts the user to\nwhat they need to do next. It also provides reports to help managers and HR\nstaff monitor wellbeing across the workforce. Arnold says that reporting\nfunction can be an early warning system of a build-up of stress or other\nfactors in the workplace:\n\n> There's a pattern sometimes that happens to sickness \u2014 surely it's one of\n> the key things in HR to pull that data and make it clear where you've got\n> early warning signs of non-desirable things happening in the business.\n\nOf course, many customers simply want to move on from paper-based processes,\nunmanageable spreadsheets or laborious data entry and scanning. But Arnold\nbelieves E-Days is also helping to reduce absence, with customers reporting\n2.9 days of sickness per employee year on average, compared to the UK national\naverage of 6.3 days.\n\nWhile the E-Days performance may be skewed by the specific demographics of its\ncustomers, the company nevertheless claims that enterprise customers typically\ngain a 50% absence reduction compared to average and see a five-month payback\nperiod. With integration to Outlook and GCal as well as core HR and payroll,\nthe app certainly aims to go the extra mile in making managing absence as\npainless as possible.\n\n## My take\n\nIn the debate between best-of-breed and suite, the focus of specialized best-\nof-breed vendors on their particular niche is an important factor in their\nfavor. The E-Days example demonstrates that if you're aiming to add value in a\nspecific function, you think more carefully about what the data and workflows\nallow you to achieve, beyond the more narrow transactional goals. At first\nglance, it seems astonishing that absence management can't be integrated into\na core HR system. But the more you discover about the real-world complexities\nof this apparently simple operation, the more the case for a best-of-breed\nsolution becomes apparent.\n\n_Image credit - Business chair

How will HR's\nrole change?\n\nIn 2017, HR leaders and C-suite executives were asked their top predictions\nfor the future of leadership.\n\nThe survey found that most believed that by 2022, automation will overhaul\nHR's manual function and propel the industry into a more data- and people-\ncentric model.\n\nLeaders identified their two biggest challenges:\n\n  1. Finding the right people\n  2. Keeping them motivated\n\nAbout half (47%) of HR leaders expected to become data-driven, using valuable\ninformation in their hiring and other business decisions.\n\nThe same percentage thus expected their jobs to become more strategic, based\non Paycor's trends study.\n\nAnother 48% believed many core HR functions will become automated by 2022,\noccasioning a shift to strategic value-added, with 82% believing soft skills\nwould become more important.\n\nFast forward to today and things haven't changed much.

It\ninvolves research to discover who your customers are, what they need, and\nwhere their pain points lie.\n\nCEM means making changes to the way you do things. And it means continually\nlistening to your customers to find out how well you\u2019re doing and what you can\ndo to keep improving.\n\nThere are a few core principles to understand when you\u2019re getting started with\ncustomer experience. The first is that customer service and customer\nexperience are different things.\n\n  * **Customer experience** includes every interaction your customer has with your brand, including those that happen outside of your channels.\n  * **Customer service** is a subset of customer experience. It\u2019s the way you treat customers when they are in direct contact with you, via text, phone, chat or other forms of communication.\n\nThe next is that customer experience is all about journeys. A customer\u2019s\nexperience isn\u2019t bound by internal divisions like sales vs. service or retail\nvs. trade. It is a sum of many parts, and in most cases you can\u2019t predict\nwhere the customer\u2019s journey will begin or where it will lead.  \n  \nAlong that [customer journey](/customer-journey-mapping), any one point of\nfailure (glitchy website, over-long wait for a chat response) can detract\nhugely from the customer\u2019s experience as a whole. It doesn\u2019t matter if the\ncustomer\u2019s delighted by one part of your business if they\u2019re later\ndisappointed by something else.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s wise to optimize every part of the customer journey and create\nan integrated, consistent omnichannel experience that\u2019s based around your\ncustomer rather than the internal anatomy of your business.\n\nResearch from McKinsey found that [customer satisfaction is 73% more\nlikely](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-\ninsights/the-ceo-guide-to-customer-experience) when entire journeys work well\nthan when individual touchpoints do.\n\n## How to measure, optimize, and scale your customer experience capability\n\nCustomer experience management begins with understanding your customers and\ntheir needs. Your [CRM system](https://www.g2.com/categories/crm) is a\nvaluable tool here as it already contains a record of your interactions with\neach customer to date.\n\nYou can also bring in tools like customer surveys and UX research which can\nhelp you dig deeper and understand your customers\u2019 priorities. Do your target\ncustomers care more about certain things than others? Which of the typical\ncustomer journeys for your business hold the most personal importance for\ncustomers? Where are they most likely to want support, reassurance, or a\ngreater range of options?\n\nCustomer-based research, and the resulting customer experience insights, will\nhelp you to prioritize your CX improvements and work more intuitively on\nexisting projects. It could also help point toward efficiencies and\nimprovements you can make for your company\u2019s own sake, especially where\ncustomer insights provide a birds-eye view across your internal silos.  \n  \nIt\u2019s likely that CX improvements will start small within a company and then\ngrow. Small, successful pilot projects will help generate interest in CX and\nmake the case for wider-scale changes and more ambitious programs.\n\n### A company-wide approach\n\nAs we\u2019ve suggested, there are major rewards to be reaped when companies think\nbig. Make your whole business experience-led and the benefits are likely to\nmultiply accordingly. As an experience-first business, you\u2019re in line for\npositive results on big picture measures like your brand loyalty, plus\nimmediate-return results in terms of sales.\n\n**According to**[US research from PwC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/press-\nreleases/2018/experience-is-everything-heres-how-to-get-it-right.html) **:**\n\n  * Consumers will pay up to 16% more for products and services if the experience is great\n  * 1 in 3 will leave a brand they love after just one bad experience\n  * Customers say they\u2019re more likely to try additional services or products when brands provide superior customer experience\n\nMeanwhile, according to [Adobe\u2019s Digital Trends\n2020](https://www.adobe.com/uk/offer/digital-trends-2020.html#): \u201c36% of\ncompanies on the forefront of customer experience said they exceeded their top\nbusiness goal by a significant margin, compared with only 12% of mainstream\ncompanies,\u201d\n\nWhat does that look like in practice? It means that experience isn\u2019t just the\nduty of a single team or department. While it\u2019s important to appoint and\nsupport experience management leaders in your business, they should be setting\ngoals and providing strategies for an entire company\u2019s behavior, not working\nin isolation.\n\n### Changing culture\n\nMaking a commitment to customer-centric ways of doing business is likely to\ninvolve cultural change within your organization. This is likely to be a\nmedium- to long-term endeavor, but there are some changes you can make\nstraight away that will promote CX-friendly ways of working.\n\n### Lead by example\n\nC-suite and leadership have an important role to play in making CX a company\npriority, not only because they\u2019re empowered to make change but because staff\nat all levels naturally look to them to see how to behave. Leaders who walk\nthe talk and put customer experience first can help turn the tide towards\ncustomer-first thinking.\n\n### **Bake CX into your goals and KPIs**\n\nAt team and individual levels you can promote customer-first thinking by\nexplicitly making it a priority in performance management and target-setting.\nNote however that you should prioritize outcomes such as \u201cmake the customer\nfeel heard\u201d rather than behaviors like \u201cchat to every customer\u201d \u2013 authentic\ncustomer connections are more likely to flourish if staff are given some\npersonal input into how they\u2019re achieved.\n\n### **Appoint CX champions**\n\nIt can be helpful to think of CX as a horizontal function, a little like HR or\nIT, vitally connected with every department. Unlike HR or IT though, it can be\nimproved by anyone who is willing and able to step into a customer\u2019s shoes.\nWithin each area of business, try appointing an enthusiastic CX champion who\ncan make suggestions and provide support in making their own part of the\ncompany more customer-centric.\n\n## Setting up a customer experience management system\n\nYour customer management system is a set of tools and processes you can use\ncompany wide to create a continuous cycle of improvement. It\u2019s likely to\ninclude elements you\u2019re already using, with a few new ideas and approaches\nadded to the mix. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to getting it up and running.\n\n### Goals\n\nThe first step is to decide what success will look like. Think about what you\nwant CX to do for your business and what positive results you want to see.\n\n### Strategy\n\nBased on what you\u2019ve discovered about your current levels of customer loyalty\nand customer satisfaction, identify first priorities. Choose one or more\ncustomer journeys to act as your pilot program.\n\n### Tools\n\nCX improvement is largely a matter of awareness and agility, and this is what\nyour tools need to provide. You need to be able to collect customer feedback\ndata at a number of touchpoints across your customer journey(s) and analyze it\nin a way that allows you to take meaningful, rapid action. You also need to be\nable to circulate those insights within your business in a clear, digestible\nformat.\n\n### Process\n\nChoose where in the customer journey you will collect feedback from your end-\nusers and how you will use it. It\u2019s a given that feedback data should be\nanalyzed to reveal your current performance levels, but you may also want to\nfeed it into parts of your business that can make immediate improvements to\nindividual cases. For example, feedback from a dissatisfied customer could be\nrouted directly to the person responsible for the relevant touchpoint.\n\nWhile having a structured customer experience management model is important,\nit\u2019s worth noting that CX is an exploratory process and you will also need to\nallow room for flexibility. You should expect your program to change and grow\nalong with your business and what you learn over time.\n\n### Measure, check and iterate\n\nWhile setting up a CX program, and throughout its duration, measurement is\ncritical. Early in your planning phase, define the metrics that indicate\nsuccess and that you\u2019ll continually measure and track.\n\n**CSat**  and [NPS](/net-promoter-score) are likely candidates for many\nbusinesses, along with [CES](https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-\nmanagement/customer/customer-effort-score/) (Customer Effort Score). You may\nalso want to pull in quantitative measures linked to CX, such as waiting times\non phone and chat channels, customer review scores, and website loading\nspeeds.  \n  \nEven more important than defining your metrics is being able to monitor them\non a continual basis. While it\u2019s true that using multiple metrics will help\nyou get a clearer and more multifaceted picture of how you\u2019re doing, make sure\nyour analytical capacity and your collection capacity are in line with one\nanother. Collecting data is only valuable if you\u2019re able to turn it into\nimprovements and predictions.\n\n### Software that supports your goals\n\nIn order to be useful, cost-effective and scalable, a CX program typically\nrelies on software to store data, route information to the right people and\nanalyze results. Here\u2019s what to look for in CX management software.\n\n#### Accessible everywhere\n\nCloud-based is becoming the gold standard in enterprise software, and with\ngood reason. A cloud-based platform means projects are easy to scale up to\nlarge numbers of users, and that they can access data and analyses on a range\nof devices according to need.\n\n#### User-friendly\n\nBecause CX is a cross-departmental discipline, it\u2019s important that your\nsoftware is as accessible as possible. It should be able to provide on-demand\ndata and insights in a format that anyone can understand.\n\n#### Analytically powerful\n\nIdeally, CX software should be able to not only collect data and analyze it,\nbut use statistical tools to extrapolate and make predictions about the\ndrivers behind positive CX outcomes. It\u2019s a plus if your software can perform\nanalysis on natural language, such as the contents of online reviews and free-\ntext fields in surveys.\n\n#### Integrated\n\nCX touches almost every part of your business, so it\u2019s important to be able to\nconnect your CX software with the platforms you already use, such as CRM and\nHR systems, marketing software, social media analytics, SEO and marketing\ntools.\n\n## Building your dream team\n\nCX is a company wide mission, and your CX team is the beating heart of the\noperation. But how do you bring that team together? To decide who you should\nhire or nurture, you need to know what makes a great CX professional.  \n  \nGiven that CX is a relatively new concept, it\u2019s unsurprising that most CX\nprofessionals have arrived from careers in other areas. HR is a common\nbackground, as is customer service. CX leaders may also cross over from user\nexperience and service design, psychology, marketing or sales.  \n  \nWherever they come from, they\u2019re united by personal qualities like empathy and\nexcellent listening skills. They\u2019re likely to be articulate and persuasive,\ngood at forming professional relationships and making the case for change.  \n  \nAbove all, they are passionate about what they do. They see CX transformation\nas a mission, not just a role, and they\u2019re committed to making the customer\ncentral to everything a business does.\n\n### A long-term view\n\nAs you embark on a CX program, it\u2019s important to set realistic expectations\nabout the timeframe of your work. CX management should be viewed as a long-\nterm program which will deliver long-term results, and it\u2019s likely that these\nwill grow steadily over time rather than offering immediate ROI.\n\nThe time it takes to see results varies by industry. As[ Colin Shaw of Beyond\nPhilosophy notes](https://beyondphilosophy.com/when-will-i-see-results-my-\ncustomer-experience-program/), if your typical customer contact cycle happens\nacross months or years rather than weeks \u2013 (e.g. if you provide infrequent\nservices like optical prescriptions or car servicing) \u2013 it will take longer\nfor customers to encounter and react to the improvements you\u2019ve made.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely that it will take time for your internal CX process to reach\nits full potential in terms of speed and efficiency. Changing minds,\nbehaviors, culture, and protocols is by nature a long-term process, and\nwithout the right tools and plans in place, it will inevitably take longer.\n\nIs it worth the effort? Absolutely. And businesses willing to make the\ninvestment now will find themselves benefiting in the future as great CX\nbecomes more essential and expected.\n\nHistorical data bears this out, too. Across a 10-year span, businesses who\nmaintained above-average customer satisfaction (using ACSI scores) [delivered\na 400% increase in shareholder returns](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-\nfunctions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/putting-customer-experience-at-the-\nheart-of-next-generation-operating-models#0). Those with below-average scores\nachieved little or no growth in their returns.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nCustomer experience touches every part of a business, and it makes significant\ndemands for change and reevaluation within a company. But it offers enormous\npotential too.\n\nCX isn\u2019t just a nice-to-have or an ephemeral buzzword. It\u2019s nothing less than\na more evolved way of doing business, and in an increasingly connected world\nwhere customer expectations have never been higher, it may well be the\ndeciding factor between businesses that fall by the wayside and those that go\non to bigger and better things.\n\n**Make sure your customers have the best experience with your brand that they\npossibly can.

They play a vital role by sitting at the executive table and\nrecommending procedures, developments, and systems. They help in improving the\neffectiveness of employees and management to contribute productively.\n\nHigh tech has transformed the way the HR department coordinates with staff,\nstores files, and evaluates performance matrices. Recent tech tools and\nsoftware can benefit the recruitment process in significant ways to manage\nstrategic direction in demonstrating their value. These technologies make\ncomplex tasks into simple functions and shield them from [productivity hacks\nfor recruiters](https://www.onrec.com/news/news-archive/productivity-hacks-\nfor-recruiters).\n\nTo better understand this phenomenon and review its various implications, it\nis divided into two major aspects i.e., core HR technology and employee\nengagement technology:\n\n####  Core HR Technology\n\nThe result of an authentic survey shows that employee disengagement costs\naround 500billion USD per year to the United States economy. Better core HR\nmethodologies can solve this immense issue.\n\nCore HR (core human resources) is a broad term which includes the primary\nfunctions of the HR department, like primitive data record of employees. \u201c\n_Core functions of HR generally consist of staff hiring, timeline, payroll,\nbenefits policy, internal liaisons, compliance, and assurance_ ,\u201d describes\nMatthew Lewis, Head of HR department at [King\nEssay](https://www.kingessay.co.uk/assignment-writing/).\n\nCore HR technology with all the advancements can be further subdivided into\nthree aspects that are HRIS, HCM, and HRMS. There are some other tools like\nrecruiting software, payroll service, benefits management platform, and\nemployee engagement tool. But below three aspects have a key role to play in\ncore HR technology. Businesses can get a competitive edge by taking advantage\nof these approaches.\n\n####  a) Human Resource Information System (HRIS)\n\n![](/sites/onrec/directory/files/teamwork.jpg)\n\nHuman Resource Information System (HRIS) is a kind of software that is used\nfor data entry, data tracking, and also data information. It fulfills all such\nneeds of a company\u2019s Human Resource management, payroll, and bookkeeping. It\nis more often utilized as a database for an organization.\n\n####  b) Human Capital Management System (HCM)\n\nHuman Capital Management (HCM) is related to people resource management. It\nfocuses on the organizational requirements to administer specific\nproficiencies and is enforced in three aspects: workforce accretion,\n[workforce\nmanagement](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/workforce-\nmanagement), and workforce development.\n\n####  c) Human Resource Management Software (HRMS)\n\nHuman resources management software (HRMS) combines various systems and\nprocedures to assure the smooth management of HR, business procedures, and\ndata.\n\nBelow are the top 10 HR management software solutions:\n\n  * BambooHR\n  * Zoho People\n  * Gusto HR\n  * SmartRecruiters\n  * Freshteam\n  * Recruiterbox\n  * Reviewsnap\n  * Zoho Recruit\n  * ClearCompany\n  * Workday\n\nThese top 10 HR management tools can be used hand in hand as core tools, and\nif required, they can be combined as several distinct systems to get better\nwork output. Many of these systems are cloud-based; therefore, they can be\nused if the business has various locations or distant staff. Hence all users\ncan connect to the system from everywhere.\n\n####  d) Other HR Tools:\n\nThe other two HR tools are briefly described below:\n\n####  Performance Solutions, ADP & Paychex\n\nVarious HRMS and payroll solutions such as ADP (Automated Data Processing)\nprovides customized performance analysis segment. \u201c _Performance evaluations\nand scrutiny are the main objectives being discussed it the annual meeting\nbetween manager and staff,\u201d_ says John Ruskin, manager of the research\ndepartment of [assignment service](https://www.crowdwriter.com/assignment-\nwriting-service) at Crowd Writer.\n\nThese evaluations are done to identify the objectives, and HR can provide\nmanagers the tools to track their employees. Paychex is another such tool with\nthe aim of performance solutions.\n\n####  Recruiting Software\n\nThese recruiting software establish the hiring process begins from job ads,\nleading to sorting and shortlisting, and finally managing candidates for\ninterview. The software assists to avoid manual tracking of candidates.\nFollowing are some best recruiting software which would make the recruitment\nprocess smooth for the HR department:\n\n  * BambooHR\n  * ApplicantPro\n  * ApplicantStack\n  * Betterteam\n  * Ascentis\n\n####  Employee Engagement Technology\n\n![](/sites/onrec/directory/files/graph.jpg)\n\nAround 79 percent of employers think that the employees have a pressing\nengagement and retention problem. This is a thought-provoking situation for\norganizations.\n\nAs technology has transformed every aspect of an organization globally,\nincluding HR working methodologies. Similarly, in regards to [going\nglobal](https://www.onrec.com/news/news-archive/going-global-3-things-to-\nstart-with), the HR department is more willing to engage with its employees by\nusing the latest technological advancements and software to benefit this\naspect. Organizations are keen to build technology-based podiums on\nencouraging their employees for information sharing and creative thinking.\n\nThe approach of feedback and analytics tools boosts the transparency in the\norganization, providing employees the opportunity to convey their opinions. It\ncan play a pivotal role in enriching positive organization environment.\n\nWith employee engagement technology, the ability of convenient interaction\namong employees will help in running operations more smoothly. Over time, most\nbusinesses are relying on technology to get engaged with their employees.\nCoordination at this point will provide employees a better chance to maintain\na [work-life balance](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ps/work-life-\nbalance.html).\n\nHere are three best tech software and tools beneficial for HR department for\nengaging employees:\n\n####  **a) SurveyMonkey:**\n\n![](/sites/onrec/directory/files/graph2.jpg)\n\nSurveyMonkey is online cloud-based survey development software. Ryan Finley\nand Chris Finley founded it in 1999. It provides free of charge surveys as per\nneed of organizations, as well as paid back-end programs suite. This suite\nincludes data evaluation, case selection, elimination of bias, and data\nrepresentation tools which can be used as employee engagement mechanism.\n\nAmong the pool of online survey space, SurveyMonkey is considered as the most\npopular and primarily used among big organizations. It meets the industry\u2019s\nmeasures, in addition to other features which allow collection and scrutiny of\nsurveys quite smoothly.\n\n####  **b) 15Five** :\n\n15Five performance management software was founded in 2011. It offers weekly\ncheck-ins, objective and Key Results (OKRs), monthly and quarterly reviews,\nand also recognitions. It also serves as a solution that incorporates\nemployee\u2019s feedback, pulse surveys, and associate perceptions for weekly\nreports.\n\nIt plays the role of a medium of conversation between managers and employees.\nManagers instruct their employees to fill out 15Five, which brings employees\nin front, serving as a driving force. In contrast to conventional point\nsolutions, this software includes numerous features about the employee\nengagement statement.\n\n####  **c) Yammer:**\n\nYammer is a solitary social networking service developed with enterprise\ncommunication as an objective. It was created by Geni (a website company) to\nassist employees in connecting and communicating with each other throughout\nthe organization.\n\nAs its name suggests (which means making loud and repetitive noise), it could\nbe used as Facebook at the workplace. It is used to post and share statements,\nannouncements, and employee\u2019s praise. On side notes, it can send private and\ngroup news, advertising company events, and collect employee\u2019s comments.\n\n* * *\n\n####  **Author Bio:**\n\nJohn William is currently working as a content writer at [Australian\nMaster](https://www.australianmaster.com/).

Microsoft is advising customers to move to LinkedIn\nTalent Hub instead. At the same time, Microsoft is repackaging some of its\n\"core\" human resources capabilities in Dynamics 365 Talent and releasing it as\nDynamics 365 Human Resources on February 3, 2020.  \n  \nMicrosoft made these announcements in a couple of December 6 blog posts (one\nof which I saw thanks to [Microsoft MVP Jukka\nNiiranen](https://twitter.com/jukkan/status/1203003347235745792) on Twitter).\nMicrosoft's Dynamics web site already reflects the coming change, noting that\n[Dynamics 365 Talent has been rebranded as Dynamics 365 Human\nResources](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/talent-to-human-resources/).  \n  \nMicrosoft is telling customers who are using its core Dynamics HR capabilities\ntoday that they will be automatically transitioned to the coming Dynamics 365\nHuman Resources product. Until then, Microsoft says they will continue to\nsupport Attract and Onboard, and that current customers can renew their\ncontracts for these apps up until June 6, 2020. Microsoft will provide\ncritical bug support for Attract and Onboard until February 1, 2022, but won't\nbe adding any new features to those products.  \n  \nLinkedIn Talent Hub is an application tracking system for sourcing, managing\nand hiring. It is built on top of the core LinkedIn network. Talent Hub\nincludes LinkedIn Recruiter and Jobs together into a single platform.  \n  \nMicrosoft made [Dynamics 365 Talent, its first human-capital-management (HCM)\noffering, available in July 2017](https://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-next-on-\nmicrosofts-linkedin-and-dynamics-integration-list/). At that time, it included\nintegration with LinkedIn Recruiter.  \n  \nAnother Microsoft December 6 blog post explains [what else will be included in\nthe coming Dynamics 365 Human Resources\noffering](https://community.dynamics.com/365/b/365teamblog/posts/building-a-\nmore-successful-workforce-with-dynamics-365-human-resources):  \n  \n\"In October, we announced our investments in [the rights to strategic\nsolutions from FourVision and Elevate\nHR](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2019/10/02/strategic-\ninvestments-in-core-hr-drive-operational-excellence/) to accelerate HR\noperations innovation within leave and absence, time and attendance, and\nbenefits administration. These new capabilities will begin rolling out within\nDynamics 365 Human Resources in early 2020.\"\n\nIt's interesting to see Microsoft start to make greater use its LinkedIn\nassets rather than just [letting LinkedIn run basically as an independent\nentity](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-linkedin-report-card-\ntechnology-integration-continues-but-at-a-slow-pace/).

Yuriko Koike decided to shutter all metropolitan schools\ntill after the Golden Week holiday ending in early May, urging all ward and\ncity governments within the area to follow suit.\n\nSeveral of the Japanese capital\u2019s elite private institutions, including Keio,\nMeiji, Sophia, and Waseda universities, have postponed their spring semesters\ntill later this month or next. The University of Tokyo, the nation\u2019s premier\npublic university, is transitioning to online instruction indefinitely.\n\nBut nobody has yet considered revamping the entire Japanese school calendar of\n2020-2021.\n\nAt first glance, the unknown benefits of moving up an entire school year by\nsome five months would seem hardly worth the accompanying administrative\nheadache.\n\nAdvocates of fall enrollment point to the benefits of aligning Japan\u2019s\neducation system with most overseas school calendars, thereby facilitating\nstudy abroad activities as well as cooperation with foreign universities \u2014 two\nareas where Japan is seen as lagging.\n\nHowever, critics argue that businesses\u2019 hiring patterns would be thrown out of\nwhack, and that students would need to plan for the extra time between\ngraduation and college admission. From an administrative perspective, there is\nalso an argument for keeping Japan\u2019s academic and fiscal calendars fixed\ntogether.\n\nHistory is not without precedent for such a restructuring, to be sure.\n\nAn autumn cycle was employed by Japan\u2019s first universities for over 40 years\nduring the Meiji and Taisho eras until 1921, at which point university\nenrollment was fixed with the start of the fiscal year in April. (Secondary\nschools had previously been aligned with the fiscal calendar from 1886\nonward.)\n\nOver the years, various prime ministers have considered returning to a\nWestern-style academic calendar commencing in the fall.\n\nBetween 1984 and 1987, a temporary education council under the administration\nof Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone considered readjusting the school year to\nSeptember.\n\nIn 2006, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s Education Rebuilding Council, dissolved\nin 2008, similarly recommended revising the academic calendar.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Japan government of Yoshihiko Noda issued instructions\nfor the matter to be discussed at the Council on National Strategy and Policy\nestablished in late 2011. Noda\u2019s national strategy council was a brief\nprecursor to the National Security Council and other Cabinet-level structures\nestablished after Abe\u2019s return to office.\n\nIn 2011, the University of Tokyo announced that it was weighing a switch to\nflexible autumn or spring enrollment, in an effort to align itself with\nuniversities overseas. Aiming to finalize the transition by 2015, the\nUniversity of Tokyo sought to pave the way for the Japanese education\nministry\u2019s efforts \u2014 formalized at the time in its Global 30 initiative \u2014 to\ninternationalize the higher education system.\n\nAt the time, Todai\u2019s plan was to leave its springtime entrance exam unchanged,\nand to encourage admitted students to use the extra time off after their high\nschool graduations for study abroad, language study, internships, or\nvolunteering \u2014 a practice often encouraged in other countries where pre-\ncollege \u201cgap years\u201d filled by apprenticeships and vocational training are\ncommonplace.\n\nTodai\u2019s example was considered by a number of other former teidai , or\nimperial universities \u2014 Japan\u2019s equivalent of the U.S. Ivy League.\n\nCoupled with the growing interest among Japanese businesses in attracting\nforeign talent, the idea remains very much alive today \u2014 albeit socialized\nmostly at the working levels of government.\n\nIn January 2013, Abe, then-newly re-elected, recommenced Cabinet discussions\non education reform, which he underscored would be critical for Japan\u2019s long-\nterm strength.\n\nLater that year, education minister Hakubun Shimomura convened a new study\ngroup on the question of fall enrollment and so-called gap terms. The study\ngroup, which coincided with Abe\u2019s announcement in June 2013 of a new\n\u201crevitalization strategy\u201d (as well as Abenomics\u2019 third arrow of structural\nreform), was additionally tasked with examining the implications for private-\nsector recruitment cycles.\n\nThis has been a recurring anxiety for companies uncertain about the\nimplications of an adjusted school calendar, or more flexible study schedules,\nfor the nation\u2019s annual post-college job-hunting rituals culminating at the\nstart of every fiscal year.\n\nStill, public opinion on fall enrollment has been mixed, though improving.\nCabinet polling on the question in 1988, the year after Nakasone left office,\nfound that most people were unenthusiastic about the switch.\n\nIn 2001, public views on the matter were more evenly split. Critically, more\nuniversity and secondary school administrators were for it than against.\n\nThe business community was less enthusiastic, with only 33 percent of managers\nbacking the idea.\n\nHowever, polling in 2012 by HR Pro, a popular industry resource for Japanese\nHR professionals, found that 38 percent of new college graduates favored a\nswitch to fall enrollment, while an additional 26 percent supported the\nUniversity of Tokyo\u2019s push for flexible enrollment. Only 12 percent outright\nopposed the initiative.\n\nAt a time when governments around the world are taking radical action to\ncombat COVID-19, Japan might want to revisit this proposal.\n\nSwitching to fall enrollment would give Japan\u2019s school administrators a much-\nneeded interlude in their efforts to help fight the virus\u2019 spread.\n\nMore broadly, it would also fundamentally realign the Japanese academic year\nwith a common model embraced by the likes of the United States, Canada,\nBritain, France, Germany, Spain, China and Vietnam.\n\nReforming the school system thus could be an additional way of bolstering\nglobal interest in studying in Japan, at a time when experts say luring\ninternational talent, especially in high-skill domains like artificial\nintelligence, will be critical for its long-term competitiveness.\n\nFinally, reducing barriers to study abroad could spur young Japanese to\ndevelop their minds overseas, an objective often given a national security\nspin in Tokyo.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the Defense Agency, the antecedent to the Defense Ministry,\nordered a series of reports on core strategic themes relevant to its future\nnational security \u2014 one of which was cultivating \u201cinternationalized\u201d talent.\n\nNational security expert Kuni Miyake, writing in these pages last November,\nexpressed dismay at Japan\u2019s recent efforts to reform its English education.\n\nOne step to the international education system that Japan deserves may be\ntransitioning to a fall enrollment cycle.\n\nElliot Silverberg is a fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Institute for the\nStudy of Diplomacy, and a non-resident fellow in Korean studies at the Pacific\nForum in Hawaii. He currently resides in Tokyo.\n\n  * [__Twitter](//twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Crisis%20offers%20an%20opportunity%20for%20radical%20educational%20reform%20%7C%20The%20Japan%20Times&url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2020/04/07/commentary/japan-commentary/crisis-offers-opportunity-radical-educational-reform/)\n  * [__Facebook](//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?t=Crisis%20offers%20an%20opportunity%20for%20radical%20educational%20reform%20%7C%20The%20Japan%20Times&u=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2020/04/07/commentary/japan-commentary/crisis-offers-opportunity-radical-educational-reform/)\n  * [__LinkedIn](//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Crisis%20offers%20an%20opportunity%20for%20radical%20educational%20reform%20%7C%20The%20Japan%20Times&url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2020/04/07/commentary/japan-commentary/crisis-offers-opportunity-radical-educational-reform/)\n\n[![Coronavirus banner](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/wp-\ncontent/themes/jt_theme/library/img/coronavirus-\nbanner.jpg)](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/liveblogs/news/coronavirus-outbreak-\nupdates/)\n\n  * [Mail the editor](/contact-us/reader-mail/)\n  * [Error Report](/error-report/)\n  * [Republishing](/about-us/republishing/)\n  * [Commenting Policy](/about-us/commenting-policy/)\n\n[JOIN THE CONVERSATION]()\n\n[ ![](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/wp-\ncontent/themes/jt_theme/library/img/take5-logo.png) GET THE BEST OF THE JAPAN\nTIMES  IN FIVE EASY PIECES WITH TAKE 5\n](https://mailchi.mp/japantimes.co.jp/take5signup)\n\n## PHOTOS\n\n![search icon](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/wp-\ncontent/themes/jt_theme/library/img/search.png) Click to enlarge\n\n[ ![Children attend the entrance ceremony of an elementary school in Nagoya on\nMonday.](https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/np_file_4359-200x200.jpeg)\n](https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/np_file_4359.jpeg)\n\n## KEYWORDS\n\n[education](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/education-4/),\n[Japan](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/japan/),\n[covid-19](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tag/covid-19/)\n\n  * WHAT\u2019S TRENDING\n  * EDITORS\u2019 PICKS\n\n  * [ Japan state of emergency to cover Tokyo, Osaka and five other prefectures  ![People walk by a big screen in the Akihabara district of Tokyo on Monday broadcasting news that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to declare a state of emergency over the growing spread of COVID-19 in Japan.](https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/np_file_4079-200x200.jpeg) ](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/04/06/national/japan-state-of-emergency-covid-19/)\n  * [ COVID-19 news updates  ![](https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/liveblog-coronavirus-200x200.jpg) ](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/liveblogs/news/coronavirus-outbreak-updates/)\n  * [ Abe nears decision on emergency declaration as Tokyo coronavirus cases surge  ![Tokyo Gov.

With offices in Munich, Madrid and London, Personio\u2019s mission\nis to make HR processes as transparent and efficient as possible so HR can\nfocus on the most valuable assets in the company: the people. Personio\u2019s\nsolution includes human resources, recruiting and payroll and supports all\ncore HR processes every business needs to do. More than 2,000 customers in\nover 40 countries use Personio, and in 2019, tech consultancy GP Bullhound\nincluded Personio in a list of 50 European startups set to achieve a billion-\ndollar \u2018unicorn\u2019 valuation over the next two years..\n\nThe new investment comes as Personio continues to grow strongly and expand\ninto additional markets across Europe. Sales of Personio\u2019s software have\nalmost tripled in the past twelve months, while the number of employees has\nmore than doubled to over 350. The company is set to reach 700 employees by\nthe end of 2020.\n\nWith the additional capital, the Munich-based company will further develop its\ncloud-based software and continue its rise to become Europe\u2019s leading HR\noperating system. The company continues to specialise in offering solutions\nfor recruiting, personnel administration and payroll for small and medium-\nsized companies.\n\nThe funding round was led by Accel, the global venture capital firm founded in\nSilicon Valley, which has backed the likes of Slack and Facebook. Additional\ncapital comes from Lightspeed Venture Partners, who have helped build many\ncategory defining companies such as Snap, AppDynamics and Mulesoft. In\naddition, Lars Dalgaard, founder and former CEO of SuccessFactors, joined the\nfunding round, alongside previous investors Index Ventures, Northzone, Global\nFounders Capital, and Picus Capital.\n\nHarry Nelis, Partner at Accel, and the newest member of the Personio board,\ncommented: _\u201cWhile software entrepreneurs have traditionally overlooked\ndeveloping solutions for SMEs, Personio has recognised this large and growing\nmarket of customers hungry for better solutions for their businesses. With\nmillions of SMEs looking for improved human resource and recruitment\nmanagement, Personio will lead the way. As Personio\u2019s highly-ambitious team\nmoves into their next stage of growth, we are excited to be part of the\njourney.\u201d_\n\nLars Dalgaard, Founder of SAP SuccessFactors, commented: _\u201cHaving had the\nchance to meet and work with Hanno and his team over the past few months, it\u2019s\nremarkable to see how they\u2019ve built a fast growing company and a great\nproduct, both with relentless focus on the customer. The idea of Personio is\nas simple as it is promising because it solves a significant and complex\nproblem for HR managers and companies alike. Having built HR software services\nfor enterprises myself, I know the value and impact this can have on\nbusinesses. Working with Personio as they now bring that value to small and\nmid-sized companies across Europe is an exciting prospect, and I\u2019m happy to be\npart of the team and support them on their mission.\u201d_\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [accel](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/accel/)\n  * [hr](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/hr/)\n  * [HR platform](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/hr-platform/)\n  * [human resource](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/human-resource/)\n  * [Lightspeed Venture Partners](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/lightspeed-venture-partners/)\n  * [Munich](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/munich/)\n  * [Personio](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/personio/)\n  * [SuccessFactors](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/successfactors/)\n\nSHARE\n\n[__Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-\nstartups.com%2F2020%2F01%2Fmunich-based-personio-receives-e67-6-million-to-\nbecome-top-hr-software-for-smes%2F)\n[__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Munich-\nbased+Personio+receives+%E2%82%AC67.6+million+to+become+top+HR+software+for+SMEs&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-\nstartups.com%2F2020%2F01%2Fmunich-based-personio-receives-e67-6-million-to-\nbecome-top-hr-software-for-smes%2F&via=EU_Startups)\n[](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-\nstartups.com%2F2020%2F01%2Fmunich-based-personio-receives-e67-6-million-to-\nbecome-top-hr-software-for-smes%2F&title=Munich-\nbased+Personio+receives+%E2%82%AC67.6+million+to+become+top+HR+software+for+SMEs&source=EU-\nStartups) [__](whatsapp://send?text=Munich-\nbased+Personio+receives+%E2%82%AC67.6+million+to+become+top+HR+software+for+SMEs%20-%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-\nstartups.com%2F2020%2F01%2Fmunich-based-personio-receives-e67-6-million-to-\nbecome-top-hr-software-for-smes%2F)\n\n  *   * [tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\nPrevious article[\u201cThe thread that ties it all together is building purposeful\ncommunities - or tribes\u201d: Interview with Ben Keene, founder of Tribewanted and\nRebel Book Club](https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/01/the-thread-that-ties-it-\nall-together-is-building-purposeful-communities-or-tribes-interview-with-ben-\nfounder-of-escape-the-city-tribe-wanted-rebel-book-club/)\n\nNext article[London-based Stasher snaps up \u20ac2.25 million to expand its luggage\nstorage solution to 10,000 cities](https://www.eu-startups.com/2020/01/london-\nbased-stasher-snaps-up-e2-25-million-to-expand-its-luggage-storage-solution-\nto-10000-cities/)\n\n[![](https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/plugins/user-avatar/user-avatar-\npic.php?src=https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/avatars/14006/1574860853-bpfull.jpg&w=96&id=14006&random=1574860853)](https://www.eu-\nstartups.com/author/charlotte-tucker/)\n\n[Charlotte Tucker](https://www.eu-startups.com/author/charlotte-tucker/)\n\nCharlotte is the Head of Content at EU-Startups.com.

executive Dean Forbes\n\n  [ ](/cmlink/activecampaign-business-digest-opinion-1.3174693)\n\n\n\n\n\nCork-headquartered software company CoreHR has been acquired for a second time\nin a deal valued at a minimum \u20ac200 million.\n\nThe Ballincollig-based company, which is led by former professional footballer\nDean Forbes, has been bought by the\n[Access](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Access) Group, a\nso-called London-headquartered \u201ctech unicorn\u201d which raised $43 million (\u20ac38\nmillion) two years.\n\nThis marks the 29th acquisition for Access, which is valued at about $1\nbillion (\u20ac880 million). The company was founded in 1991 and employs about\n2,500 people and has over 32,000 customers. The group, which reported full-\nyear 2019 revenues of \u00a3214 million (\u20ac246 million), was acquired by TA\nAssociates through a $350 million (\u20ac310 million) buyout in 2015.\n\nCoreHR is one of the world\u2019s leading providers of HR software and technology,\nserving more than 270 government and private multinational customers with over\none million end users.\n\nThe company employs about 350 people, some 276 of them in Ireland, and counts\nthe likes of\n[Diageo](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Diageo), Bus\n\u00c9ireann, Dublin City University, [Irish\nLife](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Irish+Life), Aston\nVilla, Cineworld, JD Sports, [Rank\nGroup](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Rank+Group) and the\nUniversity of Oxford as clients.\n\nThe group was founded in 1982 by [Sean\nMurphy](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_person=Sean+Murphy). It\nrecorded revenues of \u20ac37.6 million in the year to June 2018. US private equity\nfirm JMI Equity acquired a majority stake for an undisclosed sum in CoreHR\nearly 2016.\n\n#### Estimated worth\n\nThe deal is Access Group\u2019s biggest acquisition to date. While no financial\ndetails were disclosed, Megabuyte, an online platform that collates\ninformation on M&A deals, estimated it was worth between \u20ac200 million and \u20ac250\nmillion.\n\n[Arma](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Arma) Partners, which\nadvised CoreHR on the sale, indicated a deal value of between $200 million\n(\u20ac176.6 million) and $500 million (\u20ac442.5 million).\n\nMr Forbes, a former footballer with Crystal Palace and Northampton Town, and\ncurrent chief executive of CoreHR, is to become president of Access\u2019s people\ndivision.\n\nHe told The Irish Times that it was a \u201cphenomenal deal\u201d that would benefit all\nemployees.\n\n\u201cEverything we were talking about doing as CoreHR are things that Access are\ninterested in doing so this will lead to an acceleration of our strategy,\u201d\nsaid Mr Forbes.\n\nHe also said the acquisition would likely lead to the company taking on more\nstaff in Cork.\n\n\u201cThis is exciting for our employees because Access intends to use CoreHR to\nintroduce the rest of its platform portfolio to the Irish market and they\u2019ll\nneed to have extra resources in order to do it. It is likely that we\u2019ll be\nadding the number of commercial people, although that won\u2019t be in the near\nterm,\u201d he added.\n\nAccess chief executive [Chris\nBayne](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_person=Chris+Bayne) said\nCoreHR was operating in a fast-growing sector worth $5.2 billion (\u20ac4.6\nbillion).\n\n\u201cCoreHR is a key player in this space and adds significant scope for Access to\ndeliver even more solutions, to a broader range of organisations, across\nmultiple markets, in particular allowing us to bring Access Workspace to the\nIrish market,\u201d he said.\n\n  [ ](/cmlink/activecampaign-business-digest-opinion-1.3174693)\n\n\n\n  * **Topics:**\n  * [Chris Bayne](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_person=Chris+Bayne)\n  * [Sean Murphy](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_person=Sean+Murphy)\n  * [Access](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Access)\n  * [Arma](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Arma)\n  * [Bus Eireann](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Bus+Eireann)\n  * [Corehr](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Corehr)\n  * [Diageo](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Diageo)\n  * [Irish Life](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Irish+Life)\n  * [Jd Sports](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Jd+Sports)\n  * [Jmi Equity](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Jmi+Equity)\n  * [Rank Group](/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Rank+Group)\n\n## Read More\n\n  * [Web Summit organisers make Toronto event online-only due to coronavirus ](/business/technology/web-summit-organisers-make-toronto-event-online-only-due-to-coronavirus-1.4195211)\n  * [One charger for all ](/business/technology/one-charger-for-all-1.4192701)\n  * [Facebook to revamp digital currency plans, reports claim ](/business/technology/facebook-to-revamp-digital-currency-plans-reports-claim-1.4192426)\n  * [EU court backs Google in Hungary tax challenge ](/business/technology/eu-court-backs-google-in-hungary-tax-challenge-1.4191360)\n  * [Running a multinational from above a shop in Malahide ](/business/technology/running-a-multinational-from-above-a-shop-in-malahide-1.4193868)\n\n  * [Irish companies raise a combined $518.9m in VC funding ](/business/technology/irish-companies-raise-a-combined-518-9m-in-vc-funding-1.4187823)\n  * [UCD campus first stop for drone takeaway food delivery ](/business/technology/ucd-campus-first-stop-for-drone-takeaway-food-delivery-1.4184857)\n  * [Spotify holds its first songwriting camp in Dublin ](/business/technology/spotify-holds-its-first-songwriting-camp-in-dublin-1.4192697)\n  * [HubSpot announces 450 new jobs for Dublin ](/business/technology/hubspot-announces-450-new-jobs-for-dublin-1.4192490)\n  * [Life as a Facebook moderator: \u2018People are awful.

Core HR automates operational tasks, people-related entries, and\nthe management of benefits, which frees up HR managers to focus on the\ndevelopment of the organization. By having a streamlined HR function,\nbusinesses also reduce the risk of being non-compliant. The software also\nprovides easy, secure storage and retrieval of information from employee\nrecords, documents, and forms, which helps keep companies in compliance.\n\n[![](https://archinect.imgix.net/uploads/e5/e5f507f25534272ed80d416846241aec.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=514)](https://archinect.imgix.net/uploads/e5/e5f507f25534272ed80d416846241aec.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=1028)\n\nImage courtesy of BQE.\n\n\u201cWith Core HR, we have really eliminated paper files and streamlined employee\nrecord keeping so you have the right documentation available to you at any\ntime, and most importantly, in one platform. Core now also serves as not only\nyour business partner but your HR partner. Our goal with Core is to free up\nhours of time for all our users within every function of the business so you\ncan focus on profits and grow your people,\u201d said Shafat Qazi, CEO and Founder\nof BQE Software.\n\n> \u201cIf employees don\u2019t get frequent opportunities to learn and grow, chances\n> are they\u2019ll go somewhere else. It\u2019s important to spend time developing\n> talent...\n\nCore HR provides a clear picture into employee performance by connecting with\nthe project management and accounting data already within Core. Employers can\nnow see salary history, benefits, and the full-year cost of each employee to\nget deeper insights about their employees.They can compare this cost to the\nutilization rates, realization rates, and effective bill rates for each\nemployee to determine how an employee affects the firm\u2019s financial health.\n\n\u201cIf employees don\u2019t get frequent opportunities to learn and grow, chances are\nthey\u2019ll go somewhere else. It\u2019s important to spend time developing talent then\ndoing paperwork. Core HR is really a winning solution designed specifically\nfor professional services firms that want a cost-effective, all-in-one\nsoftware to run their whole business,\u201d says Setareh Motamedi, VP of Marketing\nat BQE Software.\n\n**To learn more about CORE HR, please visit[www.bqe.com/core-\nhr](http://www.bqe.com/core-hr)**\n\n  \n\n## Similar articles on Archinect that may interest

to\nfavorites](?wpfpaction=add&postid=335079 \"Add to favorites\")\n\n\"My high potential professional football career seemed to crash and burn\npretty quickly\"\n\nEvery Monday morning we fire five questions at a C-suite tech industry\ninterviewee. Today we\u2019re pleased to be joined by Dean Forbes, CEO of\n[CoreHR](https://www.corehr.com/), the Ireland-headquartered, cloud-based HR\nand payroll software specialist.\n\n### **Dean: What\u2019s the Biggest Challenge for your Clients**\n\nTheir biggest challenge is to elevate HR from being a service department and\ncost centre, to becoming the chief designers of people strategies that advance\nthe achievement of core business goals, and which also improve employee\nengagement.\n\n![](https://www.cbronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Dean-Forbes-CEO-\nCoreHR-1.jpg)Dean Forbes, CEO, CoreHR\n\nBefore HR leaders can succeed in this challenge and focus on strategy, they\nfirst need to ease the administrative burden that faces their teams around\nthings like payroll, people management, rostering and other routine activity.\nThey need to transform inefficient paper-based processes into a digital,\nautomated and integrated system.\n\nOnce that\u2019s achieved, they need a process for gathering sophisticated\nanalytics that prove the ROI of HR and in particular the contribution HR\u2019s\nstrategic work is making to overall business performance. CoreHR offers HR\nleaders the technology platform they need to tackle these challenges and shift\nfrom being a tactical function into becoming one of the central pillars of an\norganisation.\n\n### ******Technology that Excites you Most?**\n\nI\u2019m still pretty energised by how mobility is unlocking all types of new\nservices and changing the ways in which we live our lives. Not only are our\nmobiles now an integral and intimate part of our social lives, they are fast\nbecoming the way we pay for items, the device that enables our travel, manages\nour entertainment and runs our businesses. But now we can see mobile\ntechnologies going a step further with automated vehicles that will not just\nchange the way we travel by car, but will change the way major cities are\ndesigned in terms of traffic flow.\n\nOf course our own product, CoreHR XD, thrills me tremendously. We launched it\nin Leicester Square, London, end-September this year to 150 HR leaders and it\nwent down a storm. By the time the big day came, I\u2019d been living and breathing\nthe development for months, working closely with our great teams here and our\ncustomers, and often lying awake at night with a head full of ideas.\n\n###  **Greatest Success?**\n\nI\u2019m really proud of the turnaround and ultimate sale of KDS, a business I led\nas CEO from 2011 to 2016. We sold the travel and expense software firm to\nAmerican Express. It was the largest tech deal Amex had done at that time.\n\nI\u2019m even more proud of the team I\u2019ve built here at CoreHR though and the work\nthat we are doing to change the impact and relevance of HR in modern\norganisations. We\u2019re growing three times faster than analysts say the market\nfor HR technology is growing \u2013 so we\u2019re eating the lunch of big competitors.\nThis success comes down to the fantastic abilities and the tremendous energy\nof every single one of our employees and partners.\n\nI\u2019m also extremely grateful to our customers, including Cineworld, Arcadia\nGroup and the University of Oxford, who widely recommend us to their peers.\n\n### **Worst Failure?**\n\nMy high potential professional football career seemed to crash and burn pretty\nquickly in 1997, when despite playing well (I thought) at Crystal Palace, I\nfailed to win a new contract with the club, or to get signed by another\nfollowing many trials. But I got over it, re-taking control of my life by\nworking my way up in the world of IT business management.\n\n### **In another life I\u2019d be\u2026**\n\nA chef and small restaurant owner by the sea in Guyana. When I have the time,\nI really enjoy cooking. My family and I love to escape to Guyana on holiday.\nThe sunshine, sights, the wonderful people and simply the tastiest Caribbean\nstyle food you can imagine are all big draws for us!\n\n### _See also:[Five Questions with\u2026 Tradeshift Cofounder Gert\nSylvest](https://www.cbronline.com/qa/tradeshift-cto-5-questions)_\n\nTags [corehr](https://www.cbronline.com/tag/corehr/) [dean\nforbes](https://www.cbronline.com/tag/dean-forbes/) [Homepage News\nList](https://www.cbronline.com/tag/homepage-news-list/) [Homepage Top\nFeature](https://www.cbronline.com/tag/homepage-top-feature/)\n\nPrevious Article[The Benefits of Hybrid Cloud: Fence-Sitting, or Best of Both\nWorlds?](https://www.cbronline.com/feature/the-benefits-of-hybrid-cloud \"The\nBenefits of Hybrid Cloud: Fence-Sitting, or Best of Both Worlds?\")\n\nNext Article[Mimecast CEO \"Very Sorry\" for Persistent Outages - Blames\nNetwork/Firewall Issues](https://www.cbronline.com/news/mimecast-outage-ceo-\napology \"Mimecast CEO \")\n\n#### Related News\n\n[ ![](https://www.cbronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/HP-\nJF-5200-3D-Printing-Solution-fleet-Credit-to-HP-9-570x300.jpg)\n](https://www.cbronline.com/feature/3d-printed-medical-parts \"Has 3D\nPrinting\u2019s Hour Finally Come?\") [4th\nRevolution](https://www.cbronline.com/4th-revolution/ \"4th Revolution\")\n\n###### [Has 3D Printing's Hour Finally\nCome?](https://www.cbronline.com/feature/3d-printed-medical-parts \"Has 3D\nPrinting\u2019s Hour Finally Come?\")\n\n**[Conor Reynolds](https://www.cbronline.com/author/conor/ \"Posts by Conor\nReynolds\") **** ** **   [Conor\nReynolds](https://www.cbronline.com/author/conor/ \"Posts by Conor Reynolds\")**\n26th March 2020\n\n[ ![Wi-Fi pedestrian monitoring](https://www.cbronline.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/jose-martin-ramirez-c-45sjAjSjArQ-\nunsplash-570x300.jpg) ](https://www.cbronline.com/news/wi-fi-pedestrian-\nmonitoring \"Local Authorities Eye Public Wi-Fi \\(Data\\) To Help Save the High\nStreet\") [4th Revolution](https://www.cbronline.com/4th-revolution/ \"4th\nRevolution\")\n\n###### [Local Authorities Eye Public Wi-Fi (Data) To Help Save the High\nStreet](https://www.cbronline.com/news/wi-fi-pedestrian-monitoring \"Local\nAuthorities Eye Public Wi-Fi \\(Data\\) To Help Save the High Street\")\n\n**[Conor Reynolds](https://www.cbronline.com/author/conor/ \"Posts by Conor\nReynolds\") **** ** **   [Conor\nReynolds](https://www.cbronline.com/author/conor/ \"Posts by Conor Reynolds\")**\n17th March 2020\n\n[ ![3D printed bombs](https://www.cbronline.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/sergi-viladesau-dyrehVIidQk-\nunsplash-e1583839729169-570x300.jpg)\n](https://www.cbronline.com/news/3d-printed-bombs \"3D Printed Bombs?\nExplosives Get the Fourth Revolution Makeover\") [4th\nRevolution](https://www.cbronline.com/4th-revolution/ \"4th Revolution\")\n\n###### [3D Printed Bombs?

Core HR is typically used in\nthree distinct ways:\n\n  * to refer to the basic functions of an HR department;\n  * to mean the basic data captured about employees; and\n  * as shorthand for the core HR software needed to enable the first two.\n\n### __Core HR functions of the human resources department\n\nCore functions of the HR department commonly include employee recruitment,\nscheduling, payroll, benefits administration, internal relations, employee\ntraining,\n[compliance](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/compliance)\nand safety. Core HR is sometimes used to mean these basic HR responsibilities\nin [human capital management\n(HCM)](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/human-capital-\nmanagement-HCM).\n\n### __Core HR information\n\nIn the HR data sense, core HR means the personnel information required to\nlegally employ and administer to employees. This includes employee addresses,\nbirth dates, and U.S. Social Security numbers or national identification\nnumbers; employment eligibility forms; salary and payroll information;\ncompliance with organizational or government rules; work hours and absence\ntracking; and benefits information.\n\nCore HR information also includes information such as job descriptions and\ntitles and organizational structures.\n\n### __Core HR software\n\nThe term core HR has largely come to mean the core HR software, or technology,\nthat is used to manage basic information and processes pertaining to\npersonnel, in other words, to manage the core HR information. In this\ncategory, [Oracle](https://searchoracle.techtarget.com/definition/Oracle) HCM,\nSAP [SuccessFactors](https://searchsap.techtarget.com/definition/SAP-\nSuccessFactors), and\n[Workday](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/Workday) HCM are\njust a few examples.\n\nNote that core HR technology systems have long been marketed under the labels\n[HRIS (human resources information\nsystem)](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/HRIS) and HRMS\n(human resource management system), but HCM has begun to displace both terms\nin recent years.\n\n__\n\n### __Core HR software functions\n\nAlthough functions vary from vendor to vendor and specific software, core HR\nplatforms typically store basic information about an organization's employees\nin a centralized database. The database contains personally identifiable\ninformation\n([PII](https://searchfinancialsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/personally-\nidentifiable-information)) such as employee addresses, birth dates and Social\nSecurity numbers or national identification numbers, as well as other\ninformation about the employee, including:\n\n  * job specifics such as title and description;\n  * payroll information such as salary and tax withholding;\n  * enrollment data for benefits such as health, dental and vision;\n  * sick days and vacation days;\n  * documentation for mandatory training; and\n  * worker eligibility forms documenting right to work in country of employment.\n\n### __Core HR software self-service portal\n\nMany software applications that support core HR functions provide managers and\nemployees with a self-service\n[portal](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/portal). Depending on the\nvendor and the company's processes, self-service portals may enable managers\nor employees the capabilities to make updates to basic employee information,\nthereby boosting accuracy of such information and avoiding delays in updates;\nget information on pay and benefits; access training; deliver reports; and\nmore.\n\nEmployee self-service portals are increasingly being offered via mobile apps,\nand represent a particular area where the use of mobile HR is growing.\n\n### __Integration with talent management, other systems\n\nSoftware for automating the entering, managing and tracking of core HR records\nis often integrated with software for related HR processes such as [talent\nmanagement](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/talent-\nmanagement-software-TM-software). The software can also integrate core HR with\nother HR functions such as [workforce planning\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/workforce-planning)and\n[learning management](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/learning-\nmanagement-system).\n\n### __The evolving HR department\n\nThe concept of what is core to the HR function is evolving rapidly as major\ncultural shifts occur in employment and as [HR\ntechnology](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/HR-technology)\nenables the human resources department to take greater strategic roles within\nthe organization. Core HR software is considered by many organizations to be\npivotal in this shift as it frees up time formerly spent on time-consuming\nadministrative duties.\n\nAs just a few examples, the information from core HR, including job titles of\nemployees, number of employees in the company and their salaries can be vital\nfor effective HR management. In workforce planning, for example, a precise\nhead count is needed for projecting future labor needs. In learning\nmanagement, an employee may need training or classes for compliance. And in\nsuccession management, job titles and descriptions are helpful for managers\nand employees.\n\nThis was last updated in September 2017\n\n####  __Continue Reading About core HR (core human resources)\n\n  * [An in-depth look at core HR and HCM software.](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/essentialguide/Your-guide-to-successful-HR-and-HCM-software-implementation)\n\n  * [Businesses look to the cloud for core HR software and other HR tech.](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Cloud-based-HCM-options-now-plentiful)\n\n  * [Important to link core HR with talent management, but not always easy.](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Integrating-talent-management-and-core-HR-systems-valuable-but-tricky)\n\n  * [Expert tips on connecting core HR and talent management.](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Three-tips-to-avoid-talent-management-suite-integration-hurdles)\n\n  * [Where is HR software headed?

You don't need a star at every position.\n\nIt's been a lot of fun to re-visit the Blue Jays teams of the early 90's, and\na pretty good reminder about why those teams were so successful. They were\nloaded with talent.\n\nLooking at the 1993 All-Star game as an example, the Blue Jays had seven\nplayers on the AL squad that year. Sure, [Cito Gaston](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/g/gastoci01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)\nwas the manager and got to select his reserves, but he couldn't have done that\nwithout justification. As a result, [Joe Carter](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/c/cartejo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-),\n[Roberto Alomar](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/a/alomaro01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-),\nand [John Olerud](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/o/olerujo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)\nwere voted on to the team that year, and Gaston later added [Paul\nMolitor](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/m/molitpa01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-),\n[Devon White](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/w/whitede03.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-),\n[Duane Ward](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/w/warddu01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-),\nand [Pat Hentgen](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/h/hentgpa01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)\nas well.\n\nAs stacked as some of those \"WAMCO\" lineups were (W-White, A-Alomar,\nM-Molitor, C-Carter, O-Olerud), I also couldn't help but notice something as I\nreviewed the lineups, pitching staffs, and even the statistics from those\nteams. It reminded me that you don't have to have an All-Star at every\nposition in order to succeed.\n\nGranted, the game has changed quite a bit from the early 90's, but I don't\nknow that the point I'm making here really has all that much. If you're\nrolling your eyes at me right now, let's start by looking back at the 1992\nbatting lineup for the Blue Jays, and the slash lines for those players.\n\n1- **Devon White** -           .248/.303/.390, 17 HR, 60 RBI, 37 SB, 6.3 bWAR  \n2- **Roberto Alomar** -      .310/.405/.427, 8 HR, 76 RBI, 49 SB, 6.6 bWAR  \n3- **Joe Carter** -                 .264/.309/.498, 34 HR, 119 RBI, 30 2B, 2.5\nbWAR  \n4- [Dave Winfield](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/w/winfida01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)-\n.290/.377/.491, 26 HR, 108 RBI, 33 2B, 4.1 bWAR  \n5- **John Olerud** -             .284/.375/.450, 16 HR, 66 RBI, 28 2B, 3.4\nbWAR  \n6- [Candy Maldonado](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/m/maldoca01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)-\n.272/.357/.462, 20 HR, 66 RBI, 25 2B, 2.5 bWAR  \n7- [Kelly Gruber](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/g/grubeke01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)-\n.227/.275/.352, 11 HR, 43 RBI, 16 2B, 0.1 bWAR  \n8- [Pat Borders](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/b/bordepa01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)-\n.242/.290/.385, 13 RBI, 53 RBI, 26 2B, 0.7 bWAR  \n9- [Manuel Lee](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/l/leema02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)-\n.263/.343/.316, 3 HR, 39 RBI, 10 2B, 3.2 bWAR\n\nThere's no denying that there's talent in the group above, and that's not even\nlooking at the pitching staff (maybe we'll do that another day). Alomar was an\nAll-Star along with [Juan Guzman](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/g/guzmaju01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)\nthat season, Carter continued to produce as a 32-year-old, and so did\nWinfield, who was the ripe age of 40 in 1992.\n\nHowever, things get pretty thin after the top five, as this was before Olerud\nreally broke out and became an MVP calibre hitter, although there's nothing\nwrong with a .375 OBP. Maldonado was a little above average in the six-hole,\nand after that there's not a lot of offensive threats. Gruber had been a\ndangerous hitter earlier in his career, but was already in decline by 1992,\nand Borders and Lee provided their value on defence.\n\nNow let's do the same with the 1993 squad as well, and I'll even include\n[Rickey Henderson](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/h/henderi01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-),\nwho wasn't acquired until the summer.\n\n1- **Rickey Henderson** - .215/.356/.319, 4 HR,12 RBI, 22 SB, 0.5 bWAR, 5.0\ntotal  \n2- **Devon White** -           .273/.341/.438, 15 HR, 52 RBI, 34 SB, 6.2 bWAR  \n3- **Roberto Alomar** -     .326/.406/.492, 17 HR, 93 RBI, 55 SB, 6.1 bWAR  \n4- **Joe Carter** -                .254/.312/.489, 33 HR, 121 RBI, 33 2B, 2.0\nbWAR  \n5- **John Olerud** -            .363/.473/.599, 24 HR, 107 RBI, 54 2B, 7.8\nbWAR  \n6- **Paul Molitor** -           .332/.402/.509, 22 HR, 101 RBI, 22 SD, 5.6\nbWAR  \n7- [Tony Fernandez](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/f/fernato01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)-\n.279/.348/.394, 5 HR, 64 RBI, 21 SB, 3.1 bWAR, 3.3 total  \n8- [Ed Sprague](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=spraged02,spraged01&search=Ed+Sprague&utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)-\n.260/.310/.386, 12 HR, 73 RBI, 31 2B, 1.4 bWAR  \n9- **Pat Borders** -           .254/.285/.371, 9 HR, 55 RBI, 30 2B, 0.0 bWAR\n\nThis lineup was even more dangerous than the World Series championship squad\nfrom 1992, and had to have provided nightmares for many American League\npitchers. Henderson wasn't all that great after arriving in Toronto, but he\nwas still a dangerous on-base threat at the top of the lineup and definitely\ncould still run. Even with his struggles during his short stay with the Blue\nJays, he was still an upgrade over Maldonado.\n\n#### More from **Jays Journal**\n\n  * [Toronto Blue Jays: So you're telling me there's a chance](https://jaysjournal.com/2020/04/07/toronto-blue-jays-so-youre-telling-me-theres-a-chance/)\n  * [Blue Jays: How short should the 2020 MLB regular season be?](https://jaysjournal.com/2020/04/07/blue-jays-short-2020-mlb-regular-season/)\n  * [Blue Jays: Combining generations for an All-Time lineup](https://jaysjournal.com/2020/04/07/blue-jays-combining-generations-time-lineup/)\n  * [Toronto Blue Jays series simulation: Blue Jays @ Yankees](https://jaysjournal.com/2020/04/06/toronto-blue-jays-series-simulation-blue-jays-yankees/)\n  * [Blue Jays: John Olerud's 1993 season was insane](https://jaysjournal.com/2020/04/06/blue-jays-john-oleruds-1993-season-insane/)\n\nThe most significant difference was the breakout season for Olerud, as he\nended up winning the AL batting title and announced himself as one of the best\nhitters in baseball that year. I laugh out loud every time I look at his stats\nfrom that season, and he was the number-five hitter in the lineup.\n\nDespite the fact that Molitor had big shoes to fill coming in for Winfield, he\nwas able to provide even more value from the DH spot. Fernandez was also a\nwelcome upgrade at shortstop when he returned to Toronto after an early-season\ntrade, and helped lengthen the lineup. Sprague was a suitable replacement and\neven an upgrade over Gruber the year before, and Borders remained a steady\npresence behind the plate.\n\nGetting back to my original point, despite the fact that the Blue Jays had a\nlot of offensive talent back in the early 90's, they weren't 1-9 deep. They\nwere closer to being that way in 1993, but they also didn't get quite the same\nproduction from their starting rotation that season either, as [Jack\nMorris](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/search/search.fcgi?pid=morrija02,morris007jac&search=Jack+Morris&utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)\nstruggled to a 6.19 ERA, [Dave Stewart](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/s/stewada01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)\nhad a 4.44 ERA, and even Guzman jumped nearly a run and a half up to 3.99 from\na 2.54 ERA the year before.\n\nI think it's the '92 squad that makes my point more effectively though, as\nthat team was really riding the offensive talents of their top-five, maybe six\nwith Maldonado at times. Why is this significant? Again, we're talking about\nnearly three decades ago now, but it shows that a great team doesn't have to\nhave 25 All-Stars, and that still applies today. It's about having those stars\nplayers and putting the right complementary parts around them, and [Pat\nGillick](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/g/gillipa99.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)\nwas a master of it back then.\n\nAs I look at the Blue Jays' talented young core of [Vladimir Guerrero\nJr.](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/g/guerrvl02.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-),\n[Bo Bichette](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/b/bichebo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-),\n[Cavan Biggio](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/b/biggica01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-),\n[Lourdes Gurriel Jr.](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/players/g/gurrilo01.shtml?utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-)\n[Nate Pearson](https://www.baseball-\nreference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=pearso000nat&utm_campaign=Linker&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=linker-),\nand arguably more, I can't help but see the same type of opportunity ahead for\nRoss Atkins and the Blue Jays' front office. They already added some very nice\npieces over the winter, and 2020 campaign was supposed to be about an\nimportant year of growth for this core. Hopefully they'll be able to get back\nto it at some point yet this year, as it's a significant stepping stone.\n\n[ Next: What would a World Series team look like?\n](https://jaysjournal.com/2020/04/02/blue-jays-world-series-team-look-like/)\n\nObviously it's going to take some of these young stars turning into the next\nAlomar, Olerud, and Carter, but the potential is certainly there for the\nmodern day Blue Jays core. It's going to be a lot of front to watch them grow\nup, and hopefully they'll be able to bring the World Series back North of the\nborder for the first time since way back then.\n\nLoad Comments\n\nTop Stories\n\n  * [](https://jaysjournal.com/2020/04/04/blue-jays-non-roster-invitees-receive-financial-support/ \"Blue Jays non-roster invitees to receive financial support\")\n\n **Jays Journal** 3 days[Blue Jays non-roster invitees to receive financial\nsupport](https://jaysjournal.com/2020/04/04/blue-jays-non-roster-invitees-\nreceive-financial-support/)\n\n  *   * [](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885118-legendary-saints-kicker-tom-dempsey-dies-at-age-73-from-the-coronavirus \"Legendary Saints Kicker Tom Dempsey Dies at Age 73 from the Coronavirus\")\n\n **Bleacher Report** 3 days[Legendary Saints Kicker Tom Dempsey Dies at Age 73\nfrom the Coronavirus](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2885118-legendary-\nsaints-kicker-tom-dempsey-dies-at-age-73-from-the-coronavirus)\n\n  * [](https://jaysjournal.com/2020/04/03/blue-jays-draft-pool-allocations-upcoming-amateur-draft/ \"Blue Jays draft pool allocations for upcoming amateur draft\")\n\n **Jays Journal** 4 days[Blue Jays draft pool allocations for upcoming amateur\ndraft](https://jaysjournal.com/2020/04/03/blue-jays-draft-pool-allocations-\nupcoming-amateur-draft/)\n\n  * [](https://jaysjournal.com/2020/04/02/series-simulation-reds-vs-blue-jays/ \"Blue Jays series simulation: Jays vs. Cincinnati Reds\")\n\n **Jays Journal** 5 days[Blue Jays series simulation: Jays vs. Cincinnati\nReds](https://jaysjournal.com/2020/04/02/series-simulation-reds-vs-blue-jays/)\n\n![logo](https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-\ncontent/assets/site_images/bluejays/logo_jaysjournal-com__150x150.png)\n\n#####  Newsletter\n\nToronto Blue Jays news from FanSided Daily\n\n![logo](https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-\ncontent/assets/site_images/bluejays/logo_jaysjournal-com__150x150.png)\n\n#####  Your Toronto Blue Jays.  \nYour Inbox.

It is [retiring and rebranding a couple\nof the existing Dynamics 365 HR\nproducts](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-dropping-some-of-its-\ndynamics-365-hr-apps-in-favor-of-linkedin-alternative/), as well as providing\ndates as to when it will be adding new HR capabilities to its offerings\nbetween now and the fall of 2020.  \n  \nOn Feb. 4, Microsoft officials provided [an overview of some of the new HR\nfeatures\n](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2020/02/04/preview-new-\nbenefits-capabilities-for-dynamics-365-human-resources/)that are in preview as\nof today (and beyond) that are considered part of its Dynamics 365 Wave 1 2020\nRelease. Among those features: Enhanced plan configuration; more flexible and\nconfigurable administration; more eligibility setup options; and the ability\nto establish flex credit programs.  \n  \nThe [more extensive updated roadmap](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-\nus/dynamics365-release-plan/2020wave1/dynamics365-human-resources/planned-\nfeatures) (available on the Microsoft Docs site) also lists the ability to\naccess and maintain HR data in the Common Data Service as a new feature that\ncould be generally available by September 2020.  \n  \nIn December, Microsoft officials said the company had [decided to drop its\nDynamics 365 Talent Attract and Talent Onboard apps on Feb. 1,\n2022](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-dropping-some-of-its-\ndynamics-365-hr-apps-in-favor-of-linkedin-alternative/). Microsoft has been\nadvising customers to move to LinkedIn Talent Hub instead. At the same time,\nofficials said the company would be repackaging some of its \"core\" human\nresources capabilities in Dynamics 365 Talent and releasing it as Dynamics 365\nHuman Resources as of early February 2020. Officials said some of the new\nDynamics 365 HR capabilities that it is rolling out this year are based on\nrights to solutions from FourVision and Elevate HR which Microsoft acquired\nlast year.\n\nMicrosoft made [Dynamics 365 Talent, its first human-capital-management (HCM)\noffering, available in July 2017](https://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-next-on-\nmicrosofts-linkedin-and-dynamics-integration-list/). At that time, it included\nintegration with LinkedIn Recruiter.  \n  \nMicrosoft offers [two Dynamics 365\npackages](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/human-resources/overview/): A\n$4 per user per month self-service option; and a $120 per user per month for\nthe \"full\" set of HR applications.\n\nMicrosoft provided a look at other [Wave 1 2020 updates coming to the rest of\nits Dynamics 365 line-up](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-outlines-\nits-next-wave-of-dynamics-365-power-platform-features/) on Jan. 27.\n\n###  Microsoft\n\n  * [Microsoft Bing team launches COVID-19 tracker](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-bing-team-launches-covid-19-tracker/)\n  * [Microsoft to rebrand some Office 365 commercial plans as 'Microsoft 365'](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-to-rebrand-some-office-365-commercial-plans-as-microsoft-365/)\n  * [Microsoft outlines more new features coming to its Chromium-based Edge browser](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-outlines-more-new-features-coming-to-chromium-based-edge/)\n  * [How to get Microsoft Office 365 for free (CNET)](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-get-microsoft-office-365-for-free/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b)\n  * [Microsoft Teams: A cheat sheet (TechRepublic Premium)](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/microsoft-teams-a-cheat-sheet-free-pdf/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b)\n\n### Related Topics:\n\n[ Cloud ](/topic/cloud/) [ Big Data Analytics ](/topic/big-data/) [ Innovation\n](/topic/innovation/) [ Tech and Work ](/topic/tech-and-work/) [ Collaboration\n](/topic/collaboration/) [ Developer ](/topic/developer/)\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n[ ![Mary Jo\nFoley](https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/11/22/6659b56c-1175-11e4-9732-00505685119a/thumbnail/40x40/f9990a8a457465b529ef43f8677ca68c/mary-\njo-foley-thumb2.jpg) ](/meet-the-team/us/mary-jo-foley/)\n\nBy [ Mary Jo Foley ](/meet-the-team/us/mary-jo-foley/) for [All About\nMicrosoft](/blog/microsoft/) | February 4, 2020 -- 19:26 GMT (03:26 GMT+08:00)\n| Topic: [Enterprise Software](/topic/enterprise-software/)\n\nShow Comments\n\nLOG IN TO COMMENT\n\n  * [My Profile](/members/preferences/)\n  * [Log Out](/user/logout/)\n\n| [Community Guidelines](http://cbsi.force.com/CBSi/zdnetcommunityfaq)\n\n###  Join Discussion\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\n##  More from Mary Jo Foley\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/07/25fec4d6-ff44-489e-8f26-a061875fd078/thumbnail/170x128/5396c4393804cf7f90c6cbd118332ca6/m365.jpg)](/article/microsoft-makes-more-tweaks-to-its-m365-services-in-light-of-increased-remote-work-demands/ \"Microsoft makes more tweaks to its M365 services in light of increased remote-work demands\")\n\nCloud\n\n[Microsoft makes more tweaks to its M365 services in light of increased\nremote-work demands](/article/microsoft-makes-more-tweaks-to-\nits-m365-services-in-light-of-increased-remote-work-demands/)\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/07/af1406b4-5e01-4b80-a96c-0e9010672964/thumbnail/170x128/97920b4a254a48d4d6c0f044e85dba8f/msbuyscorpdotcom.jpg)](/article/microsoft-buys-corp-com-domain-in-the-name-of-customer-security/ \"Microsoft buys corp.com domain in the name of customer security\")\n\nSecurity\n\n[Microsoft buys corp.com domain in the name of customer\nsecurity](/article/microsoft-buys-corp-com-domain-in-the-name-of-customer-\nsecurity/)\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/04/01/8bc30e44-6507-4438-895b-37b913b7758d/thumbnail/170x128/d472c32061cf3d015c20a36a321266c9/slackteamscallapp.jpg)](/article/slack-delivers-a-beta-of-its-microsoft-teams-calls-app/ \"Slack delivers a beta of its Microsoft Teams Calls app\")\n\nCollaboration\n\n[Slack delivers a beta of its Microsoft Teams Calls app](/article/slack-\ndelivers-a-beta-of-its-microsoft-teams-calls-app/)\n\n  * [ ![]()![](https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/03/31/f12c6fff-16b3-4e7b-85e5-71a099d7ce63/thumbnail/170x128/08a5826cfbd88679495fc2f85709ff78/mscancelinginpersonignitemvpbuildevents.jpg)](/article/microsoft-to-take-most-of-its-external-and-internal-events-for-the-next-year-digital-only/ \"Microsoft to take most of its external and internal events for the next year digital-only\")\n\nIT Priorities\n\n[Microsoft to take most of its external and internal events for the next year\ndigital-only](/article/microsoft-to-take-most-of-its-external-and-internal-\nevents-for-the-next-year-digital-only/)\n\nPlease review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription.\n\nBy registering, you agree to the [Terms of\nUse](http://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/terms-of-use) and acknowledge\nthe data practices outlined in the [Privacy\nPolicy](https://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy/highlights).\n\nYou will also receive a complimentary subscription to the ZDNet's Tech Update\nToday and ZDNet Announcement newsletters.

With this release, Cezanne HR\u2019s\ncustomers now benefit from the option to also track attendance, using\ntechnology they already have.\n\nEmployees can quickly and easily log when they start and finish the working\nday, either by logging on to their Cezanne HR system, or by tapping in and out\non a company tablet. Data is instantly updated in the core Cezanne HR system,\ncutting out unnecessary administration, improving accuracy and ensuring a\ncomplete history is maintained.\n\nAlongside real-time attendance tracking and reporting, customers benefit from\nthe option to define their own exception rules, such as how early or late an\nemployee can check in and out, and to set up different time plans for\ndifferent groups of employees.\n\n![](/sites/onrec/directory/files/1_27.png)\n\nJohn Hixon, Director of R&D at Cezanne HR explains: \u201cThe initial impetus for\nthis new functionality was the introduction of legislation in Spain, which\nmakes it mandatory for companies to keep a daily record of the hours employees\nwork.\n\nHowever, in talking with customers elsewhere, it quickly became clear that\nthere is a significant demand for a straightforward attendance tracking system\nthat integrates with core HR \u2013 and doesn\u2019t require expensive, specialist\nhardware or software.\n\n\u201cI am really happy with the solution our team has developed, and we\u2019re looking\nforward to working with customers to add in even more flexibility in the\nfuture\u201d.\n\n####  **Update to Public Holiday libraries**\n\nA real time-save for HR teams is the automatic, accurate calculation of\nentitlement to paid time off that is at the heart of Cezanne HR\u2019s Absence\nmodule. To make admin even more straightforward, the Absence events library in\nCezanne HR has been updated to include public holidays across key geographies\nin 2022.\n\nInstead of having to add these dates manually, HR administrators simply need\nto apply the relevant calendars to their system.\n\n####  **SMCR compliance**\n\nFrom recruitment and onboarding through performance reviews and succession\nplanning to managing conduct, culture and certification, the Senior Managers\nand Certification Regime (SMCR) adds a significant additional administrative\nburden for HR teams.\n\nCezanne HR already has many of the features needed to [support HR with SMCR\ncompliance,](https://cezannehr.com/hr-software-for-financial-services-firms/)\nand with this update we\u2019ve made sure that staff covered by either the Senior\nManagers Regime or the Certification requirements are easier to identify and\nreport on.\n\n![](/sites/onrec/directory/files/2_24.png)\n\nFull details of these and other new features added in this release, and all\nprevious updates, are available to customers in the support portal.\n\n* * *\n\n####  **About Cezanne HR**\n\nCezanne HR is a UK HR Software leader for

The same can be said of Razer's people and its culture.\n\nBy: [Daniel Teo](https://hrmasia.com/author/daniel/ \"Posts by Daniel Teo\") |\nFebruary 20, 2020\n\nTopics: [Asia-Pacific](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/apac/) |\n[Diversity and Inclusion](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/diversity-and-\ninclusion/) | [Employee\nExperience](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/employee-experience/) |\n[Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) |\n[Leadership](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/leadership/) |\n[News](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/news/) |\n[Singapore](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/singapore/) | [Southeast\nAsia](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/asean/)\n\n_**It has been quite a journey for Razer since it was founded in 2005, growing\nfrom a start-up to now a 1,400-strong multi-national corporation across 11\ncountries. We speak to Razer 's Chief of Staff Patricia Liu to find out how\nits employees are engaged and how it is like working with its Founder and CEO\nTan Min Liang. Here's Part 1 of our feature interview.**_\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HRM-Razer-4.jpg)\n\nIf you ever head to the Razer office in Singapore and find yourself in the\nmiddle of an industrial building wondering if you\u2019ve got the wrong address,\nyou\u2019re not alone.\n\nBut I knew I was at the right place as I entered the office where I was\nwelcomed by a dark interior that reminds me of the gaming shop that I frequent\nduring my school days \u2013 and not forgetting the distinctively green Razer logo\nsynonymous with the gaming world.\n\nWhat was also distinctive was its vibrant workplace and a huge \u201cRazer\u201d word\nplastered across one of their walls at a gaming area where employees are free\nto play games. Upon a closer look I realized it\u2019s made up of thumbs up notes\nof appreciation among Razer employees.\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HRM-\nRazer-1-250x167.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/HRM-\nRazer-1.jpg)\n\nSo I asked Patricia Liu, Razer\u2019s Chief of Staff, what is that about and how\ndid it start?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our Thumbs Up campaign. The inspiration came from giving hand-written\nthank you notes to one another rather than virtual thumbs-up which are often\nused somewhat mindlessly,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to encourage staff to take the time and effort to pen down their\nappreciation and have these eye-catching green post-its prominently displayed\naround the office.\n\n\u201cPeople are more appreciative of one another and managers and team leads are\nmore on the look-out for positive behaviours. It is heartening to see that not\nonly did we receive a high volume of entries, the term \u2018Thumbs Up\u2019 has become\nan internal day-to-day lingo synonymous to \u2018thank you\u2019!\u201d\n\nFounded in 2005 by Min-Liang Tan, who is the CEO and co-founder of the company\nthat produces hardware, software and services for gamers, Razer has grown from\na start-up that comprised of co-founder Robert Krakoff and himself, to now a\n1,400 strong multi-national corporation across 11 countries. In fact, they\nwill move into their spanking new seven-storey building later this year at One\nNorth in Singapore - a hot bed for tech companies such as Grab.\n\nBut the start-up spirit remains very much alive at the company, whose motto is\n\u201cFor Gamers, By Gamers\u201d. And like gamers, its employees are expected to\nperform and be competitive. But it\u2019s not all work at Razer.\n\n\u201cWe are very high performing and expect the highest from each individual.\nThere\u2019s a gaming culture at Razer. We want to do our best to compete and win,\u201d\nshe said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fun and team culture at Razer too. At the same time, we want to\nmake sure our staff work hard and play hard as well.\n\n\u201cWe conduct weekly runs and yoga classes for our employees to stay healthy and\nfit. This year, we will be rolling out initiatives centred around mental\nwellness for our staff too.\n\n\u201cOur staff are also encouraged to play games at our gaming area. In addition,\nour staff are given a gaming allowance of US$120 a year to invest in their\ngaming lifestyle,\u201d added Liu.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fgaming-\nthe-core-of-razers-culture%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Gaming+the+core+of+Razer%E2%80%99s+culture&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fgaming-\nthe-core-of-razers-culture%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fgaming-\nthe-core-of-razers-culture%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

needs a hard-headed make-over, but some significant barriers\nare holding back the revolution, management consultants We Are Unity and\nMacquarie University say.\n\nTheir survey of about 250 companies indicates the need for a radical rethink\nof HR, most notably putting hard financials around the fluffy feelings and\nmaking boards understand HR better.\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nSam Mostyn is one of the rare directors with core experience in human\nrelations.\n\nThe survey highlighted a clear over-reliance on engagement surveys when\ncompanies are making commercial culture decisions (49 per cent of\nrespondents), given only one in three HR leaders can demonstrate a link\nbetween engagement and business performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing for HR to swallow, but for the last two decades everyone\nhas believed if you [chased engagement scores](https://www.afr.com/policy/is-\nit-a-cheap-shot-to-criticise-employee-engagement-20180827-h14juf), profits and\nresults would follow,\u201d says We Are Unity CEO Ben Bars. \u201cBut companies are not\nseeing that.\u201d\n\nNatalie Jones, transformation director at Pernod Ricard Winemakers and a\nformer long-time HR boss at Mars, acknowledges she was part of the pursuit for\nengagement scores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was probably one of the only really tangible measures we had to offer as\nHR,\u201d she says.\n\nJones faced a unique problem at Mars, where super high engagement scores\nweren\u2019t necessarily translating to commercial outcomes.\n\nThe food manufacturer is regularly voted one of the country's best places to\nwork. Long-time workers are nicknamed \u201cMarsians\u201d and colleagues are treated as\nfamily and friends.\n\nBut a deep analytical dive showed managers were avoiding tough conversations\nand often working most closely with friends, which was affecting the pace and\nfocus of the organisation\u2019s performance.\n\nThe fix included multiple off-site sessions where managers were asked to stand\nwith people they trusted most, then had to move to stand and engage with those\nthey needed to work most closely with for the sake of the business.\n\n\u201cWe gained the clarity needed to understand how some of our perceived\nstrengths were equally holding back the organisation\u2019s growth,\u201d Jones says.\n\u201cWe were being relationship and feeling driven, but we needed to make more\ndecisions based on facts. It made me think more broadly about the impact of\nculture.\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nMars is regularly voted one of Australia's the best companies to work for.\nJeremy Bannister\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need HR to start talking the language of business and lean into that\nchallenge of driving business performance.\u201d\n\nThe report\u2019s authors also point to a dearth of directors with relevant HR\nexperience, with people leaders reporting that only half of all boards are\ncommitted to the cultural change required to drive better business results.\n\nAmong the 1994 board seats on top 300 ASX companies, just 15 directors \u2013 or\n0.8 per cent \u2013 have core HR skills (although that\u2019s up from 0.4 per cent in\n2016, according to the board diversity index from executive search firm\nWatermark).\n\n> Having a HR person on your board shows how serious you are about getting\n> culture right.\n>\n> \u2014 Ben Bars, We Are Unity CEO\n\nANZ\u2019s Ilana Atlas and NAB\u2019s Ann Sherry are among the few directors with HR\nexperience on the big bank boards. Sam Mostyn (who sits on numerous boards\nincluding Mirvac, Transurban and Citibank), CSR CEO Julie Coates, Medibank\ndirector Peter Hodgett and Baby Bunting chairman Ian Cornell are also notable\nexceptions.\n\n\u201cThere are not a lot of HR leaders on boards,\u201d Bars says. \u201cWhen you present\nyour people and culture strategy, directors can review it through the lens of\ntheir experience from 20 years ago, but the world has changed.\n\n\u201cHaving a HR person on your board shows how serious you are about getting\nculture right.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the survey, only 52 per cent of HR leaders reported that their function had\na strong professional brand within their organisation, and only 32 per cent\nsaid they could directly relate the commercial impact of HR on business\noutcomes. Both findings underline the need for an overhaul.\n\nBars says the best HR leaders use employee engagement in combination with\nsophisticated analytics to ensure any investment will generate a tangible\ncommercial outcome.\n\n\u201cIf a company strategy says we need to grow by 6 per cent in the next 12\nmonths, how can HR prove that its initiatives are linked to that 6 per cent\ngrowth?\u201d he says.\n\n## Better use of metrics\n\nNick Tucker, culture and performance lead at We Are Unity and one of the\nreport\u2019s authors, agrees HR needs to link more closely to outcomes such as\nsharemarket performance, pace of innovation, customer experience and\nsustainability, rather than simply quoting percentage scores on employee\nengagement.\n\n\u201cThe metrics you need to track as an HR team are the metrics your business\ntracks and cares about,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is very difficult in a lot of situations\nfor HR to quantify their contribution to the commercial impact of a business.\u201d\n\nDespite boards\u2019 [focus on culture](https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-\nservices/we-need-to-talk-about-our-corporate-culture-problem-20190627-p521q1),\nthe survey also found only half of all boards are committed to the culture\nchange required to drive business results. More than 70 per cent of HR leaders\ncalled out this tension as a concern. Even where boards are committed to\nchange, directors may be pitted against executives, if executives only receive\nbonuses for growth and financial metrics.\n\nThe consultants say the future also requires breaking down cultural silos so\nthat HR and risk departments can work alongside each other, to ensure\ncompanies are driving the right behaviours.\n\nSave\n\nLog in or\n[Subscribe](https://subscribe.afr.com/?promote_channel=HI_AFR_GNL_HL&utm_source=afr.com&utm_medium=HouseInventory&utm_campaign=General&utm_content=HDR)\nto save article\n\nShare\n\n[License\narticle](http://rightsportal.copyright.com.au/pages/republicationpage.aspx?author=Patrick%20Durkin&publication=AFR&publicationdate=2020-03-03T23%3A50%3A00Z&publisher=fxj&title=Why%20HR%20needs%20a%20radical%20rethink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.afr.com%2Fwork-\nand-careers%2Fworkplace%2Fwhy-hr-needs-a-radical-rethink-20200207-p53yto)\n\n### Read More\n\n  * [BOSS](/boss)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n  * [Workplace](/topic/workplace-hzd)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n  * [Leadership lessons](/topic/leadership-lessons-1mwr)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n  * [Social responsibility](/topic/corporate-social-responsibility-1mt9)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n **[Patrick Durkin](/by/patrick-durkin-j7gb7)** is Melbourne bureau chief and\nBOSS deputy editor.

Your organization will not\nget ahead in 2020 if you follow. You must lead.\n\nHere is a countdown of the top 10 themes that will help you lead in 2020. Each\nof these needs to be considered and prioritized for your organization if you\nare to move ahead.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n10\\. Acknowledge **the end of \u201cHR tech\u201d as we know it** \u2014as nothing more than\ntechnology for HR. We must shift to the concept of digital, [which does not\nequal technology](https://hrexecutive.com/5-steps-to-digital-transformation/).\nDigital is the combination of **mindset** (which asks _why_ ), **people** (who\nthey are and how they work, which impacts how you design, deploy and\ncommunicate), **process** (how will people work, and to what end?) and\n**technology** (which can only be successful when it succeeds the previous\nthree points). If all four of these components do not produce actionable\nworkforce insights, start all over again.\n\nWhen that happens:\n\n  * the CHRO owns a digital HR strategy that causes you to adapt your organizational structure to support it;\n  * you eliminate silo work;\n  * you redefine HR skill sets to support a digital HR model; and\n  * your technology- and system-governance model changes.\n\n9. **Reset expectations for your core HR system** and what it means in the industry. Core HR is not the spine of your entire HR-technology ecosystem. It\u2019s a hub to your point-solution spokes\u2014perhaps even one of the point solutions, but it\u2019s not the entire wheel. It should be antifragile and structural enough to produce analytics.\n\nWhen that happens:\n\n  * you build an antigrafile core HR foundation;\n  * you identify what you need to be great at versus what it\u2019s OK to be just OK at;\n  * you likely use best-of-breed point solutions that are tip of the spear for those things you need to be _great_ at; and\n  * you understand the difference between employee experience and user interface.\n\n8\\. You plan for and execute **deployment, not implementation.** So many refer\nto implementation kickoff and go-live dates, implementation progress and\noverall status, and implementation goals. Those are fine, but \u201cimplementation\u201d\nrefers to the technology alone. If it\u2019s not tied to an overall deployment\nplan, you\u2019re doing nothing but a lift and shift, a technology transition from\none thing to another thing. Transitions do not drive transformation, and they\nwill never change how work gets done.\n\nWhen that happens:\n\n  * it\u2019s possible for the same piece of software to drive drastically different outcomes from one enterprise to another. Your results are the direct result of your digital strategy, not the result of the technology you used as a vehicle; and\n  * you utilize sequencing in your transformation plan.\n\n7\\. **Workforce experience becomes non-negotiable** and your foremost\npriority. This is not a trend. (Repeat until tired.) When I say \u201cworkforce\nexperience,\u201d I\u2019m talking about life as we know it finally applied to life at\nwork.\n\nWe make decisions dozens of times a day based on experience: how something\nfeels when we interact with it. This is how we live outside of work every\nsingle day\u2014how we decide what hotels we stay in, where we get our food, what\nwe buy. But somehow when we enter the workforce, we find processes over here,\ntools over there, knowledge documents scattered about over here. We need work\nto be as easy as life. And today, that is frictionless. Connected. Seamless.\nDigital.\n\n**See also:[How to give employees the experience they\nwant](https://hrexecutive.com/how-to-give-employees-the-experience-they-\nwant-2/)**\n\nMore importantly, in the decade of data, experience is the means by which you\nget data. You get data, which lead to workforce insights when people use the\ntools you give them. People use the tools you give them when they make life\nsimple, they help get something done, and it _feels good_. Data beget\nexperience; experience begets data. This is about getting the right product to\nthe right people through the right channel at the right time. You cannot get\nto people Analytics, a true competitive differentiator, without fostering\nworkforce experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n\nWhen that happens:\n\n  * interactions replace transactions and\n  * doing work feels as fluid, seamless, frictionless and easy as doing everything else.\n\n6\\. **Service delivery is redesigned in 2020.** This has everything to do with\nwhat we use to get work done: **hands** versus **heads** versus **hearts.**\nMachines augment hands, so automate that which is repetitious, manual and\nmundane. Machines are _starting_ to be good at the things we do with our heads\n(critical thinking, problem solving, computing, intelligence and analysis, and\nso on), so continue to put them to work where they can augment what human\nheads do today. Machines cannot and may never replace what human hearts can\ndo; putting them to work on some of what hands and heads can do frees up\nhumans to do what only humans can do: show empathy, communicate with\ncompassion, create and innovate, devise strategy, and demonstrate love and\ncare.\n\nThis is the opportunity of service delivery in the coming decade: the blend of\nhumans and non-humans to deliver a better experience to the workforce and make\nit easier for them to work.\n\nWhen that happens:\n\n  * you have a catalog of services you deliver to the workforce. That alone is a big win;\n  * the role of HRBPs is redesigned, and they are reskilled to fill those roles properly; and\n  * the 80% of your organizational data that is currently unstructured becomes addressed.\n\n5\\. **[Design thinking](https://hrexecutive.com/how-design-thinking-helps-put-\nthe-human-in-hr/) is imperative **to design processes that will generate data\nand journeys that will emote experience and an overall feeling. You have to\ndesign for the workforce and shift processes from B2B to B2C\n\nWhen that happens:\n\n  * people take center stage and processes are designed for the workforce;\n  * you measure what people are thinking and how they\u2019re feeling; and\n  * experience data and insights are leveraged to build experience from the start _and_ to optimize for continuous improvement.\n\n4\\. **Organizations must adapt before people will adopt.** Stop making system\nadoption the goal. Leveraging analytics, completing talent profiles and\nutilizing your ATS (adoption behaviors) will never happen if your organization\nhasn\u2019t adapted first.\n\nWhen that happens:\n\n  * you call systems by their capabilities and tools, not by their module names. Use plain speak when you talk about how people will get things done; and\n  * you provide change management to the organization, not system or process training, and it starts at the strategy phase of deployment, not upon system go-live.\n\n3\\. **The time is now for workforce insights** , or what should be your most\nimportant priority of 2020. The upcoming year will launch the decade of data.\nAnalytics isn\u2019t something you do once you\u2019re done with the rest. We\u2019re finally\nto the point\u2014with our migration to the cloud, direct access, experience and\nservice delivery\u2014where people actually use all of the workforce solutions we\nprovide them, and they use them to show how people impact the business. Data\nshould be the first thing you think about when you invest in a new technology.\n\nWhen that happens:\n\n  * you start with workforce insights as your strategy before you deploy anything;\n  * you don\u2019t separate workforce insights from service delivery;\n  * you measure effectiveness, not efficiency; and\n  * your data strategy isn\u2019t built on your core HCM. You have recognized and realized many, many sources of data inputs that became possible when you created a sticky experience of your workforce solutions.\n\n2. **Next-gen talent management goes beyond technology.** These were always HR tools, not business tools. And these days, employees own talent management\u2014what they learn, how they drive and shape their career, and how they engage in their own development. We can put the right information and tools in front of them, but HR doesn\u2019t own the experience of talent management. HR shepherds; talent owns.\n\nWhen that happens:\n\n  * you give your workforce attention, not feedback;\n  * your learning programs are delivered in an always-on, on-demand manner and in bite-sized format so they can learn when they need it;\n  * you have a more complete and comprehensive view of the talent in your organization because you need to know this in order to keep them engaged, and you also recognize the value and potential of the broadest slate of talent. This view includes contingent and non-contingent labor, employees, alumni, our complete applicant roster and our entire internal roster. With unemployment at an all-time low and job openings at an all-time high, your ability to compete depends on having a comprehensive view of your complete talent roster; and\n  * you never stop recruiting your people.\n\n1. **Roadmap and sequencing are mandatory** to your deployment planning. This goes beyond a technology-project plan. This requires the development of a digital roadmap, which is a deployment of strategy, not the implementation of technology.\n\nWhen that happens:\n\n  * one action leads to and supports the next, intentionally sequenced to work toward the ultimate goal of achieving a digital function that provides data and meaningful workforce insights; and\n  * your technology stands a chance of being successful because it was deployed against a holistic digital strategy.\n\nNothing will change unless you change. These priorities must be hinged upon a\nmindset for digital success.

Best](http://hrmasia.com/category/regular-features/five-of-the-\nbest/) is a weekly series highlighting the best HR service providers across\nSingapore and the Southeast Asia region. It is brought to you by\n[www.hrmasia.com](http://www.hrmasia.com/)._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/HRIS-79466851_m-1.jpg)\n\nThere\u2019s simply no way to overstate the value of a good HR Information System\nto any employing organisation. With some of the key touchpoints between staff,\nand across levels, it is the lifeblood of not just the HR team, but the entire\norganisation as a whole.\n\nOf course, it needs to be functional. And for many years, this was the only\nconsideration HR leaders had in choosing a system (or different modules) to\nimplement. As long as the payroll was delivered on time and accurately, and\nexpense claims were able to be examined, the system was said to be doing its\njob.\n\nBut these days, HR leaders are seeing the opportunities and risks within each\ntechnological solution they consider. They know that tech that isn\u2019t fully\nembraced by the workforce can impact retention, which means user experience\nhas become a vital point of difference.\n\nHere are five of the best service providers in this category:\n\n### JUZ TALENT\n\n**[www.juztalent.com](http://www.juztalent.com)**\n\n**+65 6384 3808**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JuzTalent-\nimage-250x175.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JuzTalent-\nimage.jpg)When businesses are considering investing in a workforce or payroll\nsolution, they\u2019ll likely begin to think about cost-effectiveness, automation,\nand value creation. The driver to JuzTalent's success by acquiring 50,000\nusers within three years has been due to understanding HR and complex payroll\nissues that every business will face in the different part of Southeast Asia.\n\nJuzTalent was built by professionals with deep HR understanding. It is a one-\nof-a-kind HRMS focused on the user\u2019s experience \u2013 from the effortless self-\nservice onboarding to radius clock-in and clock-out, personalised payslips,\nand not forgetting management and leaders are sent light-hearted notifications\nto keep the whole claim and leave processes moving.\n\nFurthermore, every client of JuzTalent is greeted with a realistic drawing of\nproblem-solving and results based insights. Whether it be small or mid-sized\nbusinesses, JuzTalent is able to provide an overview connecting an\norganisation\u2019s multiple entities operating under a single platform while they\nfocus and grow with autonomy.\n\n### BIPO\n\n[**www.biposervice.com**](http://www.biposervice.com)\n\n**+65 6877 6925**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BIPO-5-of-the-\nbest-1-250x141.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BIPO-5-of-\nthe-best-1.jpg)Founded in 2004, BIPO\u2019s Asia-Pacific Headquarters is in\nSingapore, with R&D Centres located in Singapore, Shanghai, Malaysia and\nIndonesia.\n\nBIPO\u2019s integrated, one-stop cloud and mobile-based HRMS platform helps\nbusinesses simplify and streamline HR processes.

TechTarget\n\nPublished: 07 Aug 2019\n\nAt Indonesian interior design and furnishing firm PT Gema Graha Sarana Tbk\n(Gema), automating recruitment and employee onboarding processes has slashed\nthe average time it takes to fill vacant positions by 20%, while employee\nrequisition requests are now approved within a day instead of three days, as\nwas the case previously.\n\nThese improvements, resulting from the use of a cloud-based [human capital\nmanagement](https://www.computerweekly.com/resources/HR-software) (HCM)\nservice, have lowered the firm\u2019s staff turnover rate, enabling it to attract\nand retain talent in a highly competitive job market.\n\nAcross the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, more organisations such as Gema are\nturning to HCM software to improve efficiencies in attracting and managing\ntalent, and to reduce costs.\n\nAccording to IDC, the HCM market in APAC, excluding Japan, is expected to grow\nat a compound annual growth rate of 19.4% by 2023, with China, Australia and\nIndia contributing almost 70% to overall revenues.\n\nStarting from 2016, there has also been strong uptake of HCM software in\nSingapore, Taiwan and Thailand, says Srinivas Sameer Javvadi, market analyst\nfor IDC\u2019s APAC software research group based in Bangalore, India.\n\nThe availability of cloud-based HCM offerings is one of the key growth drivers\nof the HCM market, says Javvadi, noting that these services offer a good user\nexperience, along with analytics and [application programming\ninterface](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/The-API-economy-or-the-API-\nTower-of-Babel) (API) capabilities.\n\nIn addition, organisations are looking to move away from legacy HR systems\nthat have been customised for years and are costly to maintain and upgrade.\nInstead, they are looking to adopt technologies that require less custom code\nand offer more configuration options, he adds.\n\nFrom a business perspective, the increasing competition for talent, skills\nshortages and availability of social recruiting tools are making it easier\nthan ever for workers to change jobs.\n\nThese challenges are driving HR leaders to align their HCM, data and talent\nstrategies to create great employee experiences that best serve their\ncustomers and business, says Shaakun Khanna, head of HCM applications at\nOracle APAC.\n\n\u201cResearch from Oracle and the WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management has shown\nthat many organisations have invested in the right technologies, but are\nlacking the culture, skills or behaviours necessary to truly reap their\nbenefits,\u201d says Khanna.\n\n\u201c[Adaptability and agility](https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Agile-\nbecomes-mainstream) are extremely important for organisations if they want to\nget ahead of the competition and offer market-leading propositions. Being\nadaptable is also a big factor in any company attracting and retaining\nemployees with the skills to drive them forward.\u201d\n\n### __The buying process and key considerations\n\nHCM applications provide a broad range of functionalities throughout the\nemployee lifecycle \u2013 from talent management to payroll and expenses.\n\nWhen evaluating HCM software, organisations should draw up an in-depth map of\ntheir current systems and, from there, establish what data is being received,\nhow the data flows and where this data sits.\n\nOracle\u2019s Khanna says this starts from the very foundation of the software \u2013\nthe database. Any modules deployed must sit on the same platform and share\ncommon data, integrating well with each other and allowing for a seamless\nemployee experience. This will reduce administration inefficiencies associated\nwith overlapping systems.\n\n> \u201cA lot of the time HR can operate in a silo and focus on the organisational\n> needs over those of the people. Be inclusive, be thoughtful and be honest \u2013\n> if you take this approach you will have a good framework for determining\n> what you really need\u201d  **Jill Popelka, SAP SuccessFactors** __\n\nIt is also crucial to have a complete solution that scales as the business\ngrows. The chosen HCM software, says Khanna, should be able to handle the\nneeds of a growing organisation that is changing its organisational structure\nand reporting requirements.\n\n\u201cUltimately, organisations need an HCM solution that is able to provide\nvisibility to one source of truth that is updated in real time,\u201d he adds.\n\nRob Wells, president of Workday Asia, says investing in a new HCM platform is\na delicate process that affects people in a very human way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s usually a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so they will naturally want to\nget it right,\u201d says Wells. \u201cThis is why we view onboarding clients onto the\nWorkday platform as more of an implementation partnership rather than a\ntraditional client-vendor relationship. We constantly seek feedback throughout\nthe process and tailor the platform to address their issues prior to going\nlive.\u201d\n\n### __Need for analysis\n\nJill Popelka, senior vice-president and head of SAP SuccessFactors in APAC and\nJapan, says enterprises should first understand their goals and challenges\nwhen evaluating HCM software.\n\n\u201cAre they faced with an ageing workforce and now challenged with attracting\ntalent? Is the organisation in hyper growth mode with multiple acquisitions in\nthe next two to three years? What is the digital readiness of the\norganisation?\u201d\n\nUnderstanding these goals, Popelka says, will set the framework for what is\nrequired and what is nice to have.\n\nOverall, taking a pragmatic approach with a long-term vision is the best way\nto determine an organisation\u2019s needs. In addition, interview people in the\norganisation, ask what they need to be successful and to get their jobs done.\n\n\u201cA lot of the time HR can operate in a silo and focus on the organisational\nneeds over those of the people. Be inclusive, be thoughtful and be honest \u2013 if\nyou take this approach you will have a good framework for determining what you\nreally need,\u201d Popelka says.\n\n### __Key functionalities\n\nIDC\u2019s Javvadi notes that compliance with local regulations, such as those\nrelated to payroll and security, cloud migration capabilities and HR best\npractices, are the common criteria that APAC buyers use to evaluate an HCM\nsystem.\n\n\u201cAt SAP SuccessFactors, we\u2019re seeing a variety of functionalities deployed\nacross Asia-Pacific,\u201d says Popelka.\n\n\u201cIn Asia-Pacific, in part because of the maturity of the market and partly\nbecause of the age of the traditional tools out there, we see more companies\nadopting our core HR solution, SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central, an\nintegrated yet modular solution which allows customers to start anywhere,\u201d she\nadds.\n\nWhile deployment of HCM functionalities is \u201cgenerally balanced across the\nboard\u201d, Workday sees more companies investing in features that improve\nemployee experience and workplace engagement.\n\n\u201cPerhaps this may be due to changing mindsets on how best to create a\nproductive workforce,\u201d Wells says, adding that there is now a renewed focus on\nemployee engagement with more research demonstrating the impact of doing so on\nthe bottom line.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s AirAsia, for example, is using Workday to deliver personalised\nexperiences for more than 22,000 employees.\n\nAirAsia\u2019s Workday platform keeps information on each employee and their\nemployment record, including career path, technical skills level and\nprofessional development, as well as standard information that employees need\nto do their jobs.\n\nThat includes support for employees to do their jobs while on the go. \u201cWe\u2019re\nstarting to see a rise in the use of HCM software on mobile platforms,\u201d says\nWells. \u201cThis is, in part, thanks to the constantly evolving dynamics of the\nmodern workplace. For instance, many companies are starting to see more\nhourly-based or field workers who don\u2019t usually reside in an office with a\ndesk and computer.\u201d\n\n> Megatrends shaping the HCM market include the rise of artificial\n> intelligence and machine learning, the growth of the gig economy, the\n> changing definition of a worker, and the growing use of advanced analytics\n> in decision-making  __\n\nBesides enterprise mobility, Wells points to other megatrends that are shaping\nthe HCM market: the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning;\nthe growth of the gig economy; the changing definition of a worker; and the\ngrowing use of [advanced analytics in decision-\nmaking](https://www.computerweekly.com/resources/Big-data-analytics).\n\n[AI and machine learning](https://www.computerweekly.com/ehandbook/Focus-\nArtificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning), in particular, has made its way\ninto HCM suites as more suppliers and organisations alike realise that relying\non third-party AI solutions via integration is not a viable option that\ndegrades the user experience.\n\nOracle\u2019s Khanna points out that because AI and machine learning requires\naccurate, precise and relevant data to deliver optimum results, Oracle is\nparticularly attentive to the data it feeds into its so-called [adaptive\nintelligent applications](https://searcherp.techtarget.com/feature/A-deep-\ndive-into-Oracle-Adaptive-Intelligent-Apps), and uses a combination of first-\nand third-party data.\n\n\u201cTuning requires the appropriate data records to be fed into Oracle\u2019s machine\nlearning models, using training data and machine learning algorithms\nspecifically selected for a particular use case, such as a process or outcome\nthat we are optimising,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cOver time, the models are continuously refined using the customer\u2019s unique\ndata so that the outcomes continuously improve. The idea behind pre-tuned data\nmodels means no data scientists are required.\u201d\n\nThe result of this is AI-infused HCM applications that provide hiring managers\nwith the ability to process a large number of job candidates, streamline\nemployee screening procedures and monitor and improve employee performance.\n\nEmployees can also use the built-in intelligence to find specific career\nadvice and networking opportunities. \u201cFrom there, they can reach out to these\nnew connections and receive helpful learning points they would not otherwise\nhave noticed or only realised much later,\u201d says Khanna.\n\n### __Other considerations\n\nSome organisations may choose to keep their legacy HR systems even after\nrolling out new HCM software for reasons such as maintaining access to\nhistorical data, compliance and reporting requirements, as well as verifying\ninformation on terminated employees when faced with lawsuits.\n\nWhen deciding if legacy systems should be retained, organisations will need to\nconsider if supplier support is still available and at what cost, the risks of\ndata loss or data corruption, as well as the possibility of storing the data\non an archival system.\n\nWhen determining the return on investment of a new HCM implementation, the\ncost of keeping a legacy system, as well as licensing, implementation and\nsupport costs of the new system should be weighed against expected business\noutcomes such as manpower savings and productivity improvements.\n\nAlso, factor in the cost of new hardware or any hardware upgrades in the case\nof on-premise implementations, as well as costs associated with training, data\nintegration and software customisation.\n\n#### Read more about business applications in APAC\n\n  * Oracle co-CEO

But the workforce \u2013\nand the way we work \u2013 also is rapidly changing, creating a new demand for\nleaders to shift their mindset from a focus on process to a focus on people.\n\nIn this new reality, in which talent is key to competitive advantage, every\nleader needs to think differently about their role in creating and maintaining\nemployee experiences. Human resources executives can play a critical role\nhere, helping build operating models that use enabling technologies to create\nan environment in which workers are treated like critical drivers of value.\n\nThe talent picture is complex as organizations respond to workforce pressures\non four main fronts:\n\n**Diversifying workforce demographics.** For the first time, corporations need\nto manage the presence of up to five distinct generational groups in the\nworkforce, each with its own wants, needs, and motivators. These divergent\nrequirements complicate the process of shaping company culture and delivering\non the employee value proposition (EVP).\n\n**The rise of contingent labor.** According to [KPMG\u2019s 2018 CEO Outlook\nsurvey](https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2018/growing-pains.html), almost all\ncompanies in the U.S. (99%) use a contingent workforce in some capacity.\nIncreasing use of contingent and \u201cgig\u201d workers complicates workforce planning,\ncreating many possible ways to achieve an optimal workforce size, shape, or\ncomposition.\n\n**The shift to a consumer mindset.** Employees are increasingly \u201cshopping\u201d for\njobs, seeking tailored employment experiences that align with their personal\ngoals and values. This mindset not only changes talent attraction and hiring\nstrategies, it also increases the need for an employment experience that\ndelivers a sense of deeper purpose and fulfillment.\n\n**Intelligent automation in the workplace.** Automation technologies already\nhave a deep impact on talent strategies. In addition to increasing\nproductivity and streamlining time-consuming manual work, automation impacts\nworkflows, increases employee reskilling requirements, and creates demand for\nnew roles and new technical specializations.\n\nIn this evolving workplace, creating the right employee experience can help\norganizations attract and retain high-value employees who deliver competitive\nadvantage. In these enhanced environments, these employees also can work more\ninnovatively and more productively.\n\nResearch shows organizations with specific employee experience programs and\nstrategies report up to three times higher profit growth. Part of this growth\nis due to lower operating margins stemming from employees being more\ninnovative in how they work, but lower employee turnover also contributes\nmeasurable savings.\n\nCreating this new kind of employee experience demands that leaders look at\noperations through a customer experience lens. This must be built on\nassessments and analysis, not just company programs, but also the wants and\nneeds of each employee from their career, their workplace, and their employer.\nFrom there, the company can begin to shape tailored experiences for a multi-\ngenerational workforce with many different employee types.\n\nAnd leaders can\u2019t be limited to just insights from annual performance reviews\nor opinion services: They need to keep a finger on the pulse of the current\nemployee experience. What do workers want across their digital, social, and\nenvironmental experiences? Is your organization meeting those needs?\n\nMechanisms and technology that allow for real-time feedback and sentiment\nanalysis can ensure that workers feel heard and allow the organization to\nrespond swiftly in the moments that matter. This feedback can also provide\nopportunities to iterate on the delivered experience based on worker responses\nand fill the gaps in the EVP.\n\nEnhancing employee experiences means placing a greater emphasis on the\nstructural elements that shape that work and thus shape the employees\u2019 day-to-\nday experiences within the organization. Employees need to be surrounded by a\nplatform of human-centered services that are provided or supported by HR. This\nmeans that instead of focusing on process, the HR organization of the future\nwill be more like a platform or service provider that meets the needs of\ndifferent \u201cinternal customers\u201d or worker groups in many different ways.\n\nAll of these elements must come together in order to support transformation.\n\nFor instance, KPMG recently worked with a company in which fierce competition\nfrom emerging fintech firms put this long-standing, multinational financial\nservices company under intense pressure to modernize. To create a business\ncapable of meeting evolving customer expectations and competing in the digital\nworld, they needed to make significant changes to their workforce, technology,\nand culture. The people agenda would drive this change, but they also needed\naccess to in-depth insights into the future of the finance industry and the\ncontribution of technology to business strategy.\n\nThe firm\u2019s current HR information system required a large IT team to support,\nrun, and customize it, with associated cost implications. This, together with\nmany broader challenges in human capital management, meant that millions of\ndollars were exiting their business. They needed to move from a system that\nperformed core HR administration to one that helped them drive talent and\nperformance. They also needed to modernize their operations through better\nprocesses and self-service.\n\nA key consideration was whether to implement a new HR platform. KPMG helped\nshape the firm\u2019s HR transformation strategy, vision, and road map, utilizing\npre-configured tools, templates, transformation enablers, and methodologies\nfrom KPMG Powered Enterprise. This helped manage risk, provide clear scope,\nand support business value.\n\nToday, the firm better enables their workforce and leaders to drive the change\nnecessary to become a modern financial services organization.\n\nIn this digital age, with the emerging and increasingly fierce war for talent\nand skills, creating an employee experience that differentiates employers and\nactually retains talent will be critical. Traditional, task-focused workplace\ncultures are a significant barrier to true digital transformation. Addressing\nand quickly closing the employee experience gap needs to be a business\npriority for every leader today. Instead of making transformation a goal, make\nit a way of business.\n\nTo learn more, visit\n[read.kpmg.us/PoweredHR](https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2019/powered-\nenterprise-\nhr.html?utm_source=vanity&utm_medium=referral&mid=m-00004253&utm_campaign=c-00079549&cid=c-00079549).\n\n[Coronavirus](/insight-center/coronavirus) [Magazine](/magazine)\n[Popular](/most-popular) [Topics](/topics) [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n[Video](/video) [Store](/store) [The Big Idea](/big-ideas) [Visual\nLibrary](/visual-library) [Reading Lists](/reading-lists) [Case\nSelections](/case-selections)\n\n[![Harvard Business Review Home](/resources/css/images/hbr_logo.svg)](/)\n\n[**Subscribe**](/subscribe)\n\n###### Explore HBR\n\n  * [The Latest](/the-latest)\n  * [Most Popular](/most-popular)\n  * [All Topics](/topics)\n  * [Magazine Archive](/magazine)\n  * [The Big Idea](/big-ideas)\n  * [Reading Lists](/reading-lists)\n  * [Case Selections](/case-selections)\n  * [Video](/video)\n  * [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n  * [Webinars](/webinars)\n  * [Visual Library](/visual-library)\n  * [My Library](/my-library)\n  * [Newsletters](/email-newsletters)\n  * [HBR Ascend](https://hbrascend.org/)\n\n###### HBR Store\n\n  * [Article Reprints](/store/articles)\n  * [Books](/store/books)\n  * [Cases](/store/case-studies)\n  * [Collections](/store/collections)\n  * [Magazine Issues](/store/magazine-issues)\n  * [HBR Guide Series](/store/landing/guides)\n  * [HBR 20-Minute Managers](/store/landing/20-minute-managers)\n  * [HBR Emotional Intelligence Series](/store/landing/emotional-intelligence-series)\n  * [HBR Must Reads](/store/landing/mustreads)\n  * [Tools](/store/tools)\n\n###### About HBR\n\n  * [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n  * [Advertise with Us](/hbr-advertising-sales)\n  * [Information for Booksellers/Retailers](/booksellers-retailers)\n  * [Masthead](/about-hbr)\n  * [Global Editions](/global-editions)\n  * [Media Inquiries](/media-inquiries)\n  * [Guidelines for Authors](/guidelines-for-authors-web)\n  * [HBR Analytic Services](/hbr-analytic-services)\n\n###### HBR Subscriber Assistance\n\n  * [Subscribe](/subscribe)\n  * [Subscriber Help](/subscriber-help)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.274.3214](tel:+18002743214)  \n[harvard@cdsfulfillment.com](mailto:harvard@cdsfulfillment.com)  \n[hbr.org/subscriberservices](/subscriberservices)\n\n  * International:  \n[+44.1858.438.412](tel:+441858438412)  \n[(Asia Pacific: +61.2.9158.6127)](tel:+61291586127)  \n[hbr@subscription.co.uk](mailto:hbr@subscription.co.uk)  \n[subscription.co.uk/hbr/help](https://www.subscription.co.uk/hbr/help)\n\n###### HBR.ORG Customer Assistance\n\n  * [Help Center](/help-customer-service-home)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.988.0886](tel:+18009880886)\n\n  *   * International:  \n[617.783.7500](tel:+16177837500)\n\n  * Email:  \n[customerservice@harvardbusiness.org](mailto:customerservice@harvardbusiness.org)\n\n  * [Copyright Permissions](/permissions)\n\n###### Follow HBR\n\n  * __[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/HBR)\n  * __[Twitter](http://twitter.com/HarvardBiz)\n  * __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review?trk=biz-companies-cym)\n  * __[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harvard_business_review/?hl=en)\n  * __[Your Newsreader](http://feeds.hbr.org/harvardbusiness/)\n\n![Harvard Business Publishing](/resources/images/2018/new_logo_May11.png)\n\n  * [About Us](/corporate/about)\n  * [Careers](/corporate/careers)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n  * [Copyright Information](/corporate/copyright)\n  * [Trademark Policy](http://trademark.harvard.edu/pages/trademark-notice)\n\n  \n\nHarvard Business Publishing:\n\n  * [Higher Education](http://hbsp.harvard.edu/)\n  * [Corporate Learning](http://www.harvardbusiness.org)\n  * [Harvard Business Review](http://hbr.org/)\n  * [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Harvard Business School Publishing.
