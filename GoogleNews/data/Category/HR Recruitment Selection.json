So what is the disconnect?\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | March 17, 2020\n\nTopics: [Digital Transformation](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/digital-\ntransformation/) | [Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/hrtechnology/) |\n[Leadership](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/leadership/)\n\n_Tom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/83424484_m.jpg)\n\nInjecting new or updated technology into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover US$5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a US$250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% said the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, said Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner.\n\nTinder said her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe said. In fairness, she noted, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn\u2019t matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder said. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don\u2019t have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d\n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, said that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she said, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille said.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explained.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explained. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he added.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte said, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he said, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears said. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nSears said traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder said, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears said, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook said, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he said. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook said. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook said HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concluded. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Dissecting+the+employer+disconnect+in+HR+technology&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

New\ntechnologies and advanced hiring practices undoubtedly played a hand, and this\ndisruption shows no signs of slowing as we enter the new decade. Let's see how\ninnovation and social expertise will shape 2020 and beyond.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n### **1\\. Natural Language Processing**\n\n  \nThe single biggest trend shaping recruitment in 2020 will be the use of\nartificial intelligence (AI) to the source, assess, and screen employees. The\npower of natural language processing (NLP) tools is set to make a key change\nat every step of the way.\n\nManually screening resumes is still one of the most time-consuming tasks\nrecruiters face, but with NLP, the best applicants can be identified swiftly.\nNLP can also be used to interact with potential candidates and offer\npersonalized communication with the latest chatbot technology. Finally, NLP\nand voice recognition are being combined to help analyze and review candidate\ninterviews.\n\nHowever, human bias is easily carried into the behavior of any AI model.\nOrganizations must ensure those producing the algorithms do so in compliance\nwith the company-approved anti-bias guidelines [to avoid\nthis](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/business/algorithm-bias-fix.html)\nscenario.\n\n### **2\\. Predictive analytics**\n\n  \nRecommender systems and predictive analytics will begin to play a larger role\nin the recruiting processes of many companies.\n\nVarious technology players on the market already allow recruiters to identify\nthe best matches for a job based on numerous parameters, such as location,\npast experience, education, and relationship networks. This is taken a step\nfurther with predictive analytics and recommender systems that provide\nrecruiters with additional insights. These systems are able to generate\nselective lists of candidates who are best fitted for the job on offer and\neven uncover candidates that are not actively seeking new opportunities.\n\nIn addition to making the employee selection process faster or activating a\ndormant talent pool, intelligent systems can also signal when a current\nemployee is getting ready to quit a current job. Smart recruiters will be\nusing these insights to make the most appropriate interventions and talent\ndecisions.\n\nLearn More:\n\n### **3\\. Remote work**\n\n  \nFlexible schedules and work-from-home policies are turning into one of the\nmost sought after benefits that job candidates look for, and organizations\nneed to adapt to the work aspirations of their employees.\n\nThat's why we increasingly see more and more fully-remote companies. By\nallowing people to work remotely, companies are also increasing their talent\npool because now they can access global talent without the limitations of\ngeographical boundaries.\n\nAs such, we will see an increase in the use of tools and technologies that\nhelp manage remote teams, including virtual offices, augmented and virtual\nreality work environments, as well as advanced multi-media communication\ntools.\n\n### **4\\. Work culture**\n\n  \nCulture is the glue that binds a company together. However, the increase in\nremote work makes building and maintaining a solid company culture more\nchallenging. Therefore, it will become increasingly critical for organizations\nto put effort into rallying the employees around their core values, company\nmission, and overall vision.\n\nWe will see a rise in organizations creating a dedicated role to focus solely\non building company culture and team cohesion. Part of the challenge will be\nto blend a company culture that can be embraced by baby boomers, Gen Z, and\nMillennials - and their varying expectations and career aspirations - alike.\n\n### **5\\. Acqui-hires**\n\n  \nPeople are one of the most valuable assets in any company. While they may not\nshow up in the balance sheet, employees often represent the bulk of a\ncompany's value. That's why we are likely to see a growing number of\nacquihires happening on the market.\n\nAs recruiters increasingly spend more time and money to find the perfect\ncandidates, talent acquisition competition grows. Recruiters are therefore\nlooking to different avenues to proactively and quickly build up talent pools.\nBuying up companies for their human capital is one of these techniques.\n\nHowever, recruiters should be mindful of culture clash during this process,\nwhich can limit the smooth integration of the companies involved. Dedicating a\nmultidisciplinary team to facilitate cultural integration is paramount to the\nsuccess of all acquihires.\n\n### **6\\. Social media recruiting**\n\n  \nAs recruiters reach for the extra mile, the logical step is to go where their\npotential candidates really are, and most of them are already on social media.\nWith increased mobile usage and on-the-go interactions, recruiters will\nincreasingly capture users' attention on platforms like Facebook or Twitter.\n\nThat's why in 2020, we will witness more use of recruiting hashtags and eye-\ncatching content, including videos, as part of recruitment marketing. We will\nalso see more organizations encourage employees to share their winning content\nto lure in new employees and build up their recruiting clout.\n\n### **7\\. Diversity**\n\n  \nIt's been proven numerous times that diverse teams perform better, so ever\nmore HR departments, staffing agencies, and recruiting firms will have\ndesignated staff dedicated exclusively to increasing diversity at the\ncompanies they serve.\n\nOrganizations will put more effort into tailoring job postings to attract more\ndiverse candidates, reshape the language in job descriptions to be more\ngender-neutral, and advertise jobs in diverse community groups. We will also\nsee an increase in the number of staffing agencies that are specialized in\ndiversity, challenging the status quo around underrepresented gender, race,\nand other similar demographics.\n\nLearn More:\n\n### **8\\. Employer branding**\n\n  \nPeople want to work at companies that they can be proud of. Therefore, the\nmost important thing for an employer is to build their employer brand and make\nthe vision and mission of the company crystal clear.\n\nAccording to a [study](http://web.careerarc.com/op-employer-branding-\nstudy.html) by CareerArc, 75% of job seekers consider an employer's brand\nbefore applying, so building content around employee experience is crucial.\nThat's why we will see more organizations focused on building website sections\ndedicated to the company mission, employee life and stories, and other\nrelevant employer branding content.\n\n### **9\\. Soft skills**\n\n  \nAccording to a LinkedIn [study](https://www.fastcompany.com/90298828/linkedin-\nresearch-reveals-the-value-of-soft-skills), 89% of bad hires typically lack\nsoft skills such as creativity, persuasion, teamwork, collaboration,\nadaptability, and time management. But identifying such skills has\ntraditionally been a challenge, which is why recruiters are looking to revamp\ntheir assessment processes as the demand grows.\n\nRecruiters will be increasingly interested in learning from a candidate's body\nlanguage and choice of words, as well as previous behavioral patterns,\nteamwork dynamics, ethical dilemmas, conflict resolution, and other similar\nfactors.\n\nAnother soft skill that is gaining increased prominence is the candidates'\nability to build large networks across various industries and sectors. Digital\nplatforms allow employees to amplify the reach of any company message through\ntheir own networks, providing a significant competitive advantage in sales,\nrecruiting, fundraising, and overall reach.\n\n### **10\\. Hiring quality**\n\n  \nTechnology can be leveraged to assess new candidates, but it can also be\nprogressively used to measure the performance of the recruiting team itself.\nWhile the cost and time-to-hire are easier to quantify, the quality is a\nlittle harder to assess.\n\nRecruiters will experiment with AI models that provide deeper insights into\nthe quality of their hires by analyzing various defined metrics and overall\nperformance within the team over a set period of time. These models will take\ninto account not only hard skills and expertise but also new hires' soft\nskills and overall performance KPIs.\n\n_Do you have any recruitment trends in mind?

HR technology, buyers remain unsatisfied with\noutcomes.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | March 9, 2020 \u2022 6 min read\n\nTopics: [HR

into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover $5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a $250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% say the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\n  \n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, says Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner. (Tinder will be among the presenters at the upcoming [Select HR\nTech](https://www.selecthrtech.com) conference in June.)\n\nTinder says her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n> \u201cYou can get the best product on the market and spend millions of dollars.\n> But if you don't have the right project partner and the right project plan,\n> it's going to fail.\u201d\u2014Bonnie Duncan Tinder, Raven Intel\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe says. In fairness, she notes, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don't have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn't matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder says. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don't have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it's going to fail.\u201d\n\n  \n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, says that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she says, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille says.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explains.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explains. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he adds.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Marcotte-head-\nshot-2019-250x167.jpg)\n\nScot Marcotte\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte says, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte says.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he says, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte says.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n> \u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\n> work together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and\n> people\u2014sense.\u201d\u2014Scot Marcotte, Buck\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears says. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he says.\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/JonathanSears-250x375.jpg)\n\nJonathan Sears\n\nSears says traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder says, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she says. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears says, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he says. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook says, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he says. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook says. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook says HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concludes. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n_To learn more about how to ensure success in your HR-tech projects, register\nfor_[ _Select HR Tech_](https://www.selecthrtech.com/topics) _, the new\nconference from the creators of_ Human Resource Executive\u00ae _and the HR\nTechnology Conference & Exposition\u00ae that debuts June 9-11 in Las Vegas._\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

At the time of publishing,\nthe confirmed cases across the globe had hit 114,549 and total deaths reached\n4,028. The whole of Italy \u2013 a country of circa 60 million people \u2013 is now on\nlockdown.\n\nThe UK has had more new cases in the last 24 hours than China and the deputy\nchief medical officer has said \u201cthousands\u201d of people in the UK will be\ninfected. The UK\u2019s chief medical adviser has warned that those who show \u201ceven\nminor\u201d signs of respiratory tract infections or fever will soon be told to\nself-isolate.\n\nThe virus is, unsurprisingly, having a huge impact on businesses and the\nrecruitment industry is certainly not immune to that. Businesses are having to\nadapt quickly in order to survive and it is very possible that the legacy of\nCOVID-19 may forever change the nature of recruitment and the workplace\nlandscape.\n\n####  **Travel sector facing crisis**\n\nThose recruiting for the travel sector will perhaps be hardest hit in the\nshort term. TUI, Virgin Atlantic and EasyJet have all announced recruitment\nfreezes due to steep reductions in bookings and many UK-based carriers are\nalso offering employees unpaid leave in an attempt to mitigate a financial\ndownturn caused by COVID-19. Flybe folded last week, blaming Coronavirus for\nbeing the last straw in an already \u2018difficult situation.\u2019 Hotels, cruises and\ntour operators are also being hit hard as travel is being scaled down, both\nfor business and pleasure. The travel industry is experiencing its worst\ncrisis in 18 years and the IATA has warned that the revenue cost to the global\naviation industry in 2020 could reach $113bn.\n\n####  **Remote online recruitment aided by digital tools**\n\nOf course, the very fact that recruitment is an industry that often\nnecessitates face-to-face contact is also something to consider given the push\nto contain the virus and people\u2019s own fears. Data uncovered by\n[WaveTrackR](https://wavetrackr.com/uk/), a multi-poster and data analytics\ntool, reveals a 19% dip in applications in January as compared to January 2019\nand a massive 47% reduction in applications in February compared with February\n2019. This certainly seems to indicate that jobseekers are becoming hesitant\nto enter the process, due perhaps to a combination of a desire to stay in the\nsecurity of their current job in uncertain times and concerns over the face-\nto-face nature of the recruiting process.\n\nWhile the former issue is harder to tackle, the latter is something recruiters\ncan do something about. Recruiters in areas that have so far been hardest hit\nby COVID-19 have increasingly turned to online communication tools to avoid\nface-to-face meetings where possible. Video conferencing tools such as Zoom,\nSkype and Microsoft Teams are being used both to communicate with clients and\nto interview and \u2018meet\u2019 with candidates. HSBC\u2019s Hong Kong office has posted\nthe following message on their recruitment page: \u201cDue to the current situation\nrelated to the Novel Coronavirus, we\u2019re leveraging our digital capabilities to\nensure we can continue to recruit top talent at HSBC.\u201d The post goes on to say\nthat candidates will be asked to use one of their digital tools as they\nproceed through the application process and will be guided through that by one\nof HSBC\u2019s recruitment advisers. This is something we may see more and more in\nthe UK as a way to continue to safely recruit as the situation develops. As a\nrecruiter, it is worth ensuring you have the tools needed to effectively carry\nout this type of remote online recruitment should you feel it is warranted.\n\n####  **Long-term change to workplace practice?**\n\nAcross much of China, Japan, South Korea and Italy, public transport, event\nspaces, entertainment centres and workplaces are empty and ghostly silent as\ncompanies and anywhere that amasses a crowd have shut down and schools have\nclosed. It is unsurprising that such organisations are doing everything they\ncan to contain Coronavirus and lessen the impact on their workforce and it is\nstill very possible that the UK could follow suit. Whichever way this virus\nprogresses and whatever the outcome, it may have a lasting effect on workplace\npractices. Employers are currently being forced to think outside the box in\norder to manage a rapidly evolving crisis. If people need to self-isolate but\ncan still work, if we are encouraged to work from home by the government, or\nif schools close for a period of time, we could see an unprecedented number of\npeople across the UK working remotely.\n\nCurrently, businesses across the world are increasingly reducing business\ntravel, encouraging remote working and having to be fluid as they keep up to\ndate with public health advice. The [Financial\nTimes](https://www.ft.com/content/afa45c14-5888-11ea-a528-dd0f971febbc)\nreported that international banks based in Japan have brought in split teams\nto prevent a situation where whole departments could be incapacitated. This\nhas been effected largely because Japan has only recently come onboard with\nremote working (due mainly to cultural ethos) and so many businesses don\u2019t\nhave the framework in place to allow for it.\n\n####  **A reduction in business travel and an increase in remote working**\n\nUnlike Japan, many UK businesses already allow for remote working in some\nform. Online communication and file-sharing tools could help businesses\ncontinue to operate if a prolonged period of home working is necessitated.\nMany companies have imposed a ban on non-essential business travel, nationally\nas well as internationally, and such online tools will provide ways to\ncommunicate with clients without having to travel to them. Given the\nincreasing desire felt by many for [flexible\nworking](https://wavetrackr.com/uk/news/changing-demographics-and-the-need-\nfor-workplace-flexibility/) opportunities and the ecological impact of travel\nby air and car, the adjustments made in response to Coronavirus could very\nwell change the way we work in the long term.\n\nWhat can we take from all this and how do we progress forwards? COVID-19 is a\nglobal issue and as such will affect the recruitment industry in some, if not\nmany, ways. [WaveTrackR](https://wavetrackr.com/uk/)\u2019s data indicates a\nreduction of applications on average across all industries and no-one knows\nhow this will play out. However, there are ways we can mitigate the impact,\nsuch as utilising online communication tools in the recruitment process and\nencouraging employers to emphasise the benefits of working for their\norganisation, including, where possible, flexible working. The recruiters that\nweather the Coronavirus storm will be those that adapt as the situation\nunfolds.\n\n####  By Emily Buckley, Copywriter, Wave\n\nRelated company:\n\n![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/Wave-logo.jpg)\n\nPremium[Wave Recruitment Solutions](/directory/recruiter-suppliers/wave-\nrecruitment-solutions)[View profile](/directory/recruiter-suppliers/wave-\nrecruitment-solutions)\n\nKeep up to date with industry news\n\nReceive our daily news straight to your inbox\n\n## Related News\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/Wave_0.jpg?itok=C26PQzOJ)](/news/opinion/how-temporary-work-could-offer-a-lifeline-for-recruiters-during-coronavirus)\n\n    * 01 Apr 2020\n|\n\n    * [Opinion](/category/events/news-4)\n\n### [How temporary work could offer a lifeline for recruiters during\nCoronavirus](/news/opinion/how-temporary-work-could-offer-a-lifeline-for-\nrecruiters-during-coronavirus)\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/Wave.jpg?itok=4gRbBm1_)](/news/news-archive/in-the-spotlight-wave-recruitment-solutions)\n\n    * 24 Mar 2020\n|\n\n    * [News archive](/category/events/news-5)\n\n### [In the spotlight: Wave Recruitment Solutions](/news/news-archive/in-the-\nspotlight-wave-recruitment-solutions)\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/pexels-photo-374897.jpeg?itok=FO4DWro4)](/news/news-archive/top-tips-to-setting-a-remote-office-during-coronavirus)\n\n    * 24 Mar 2020\n|\n\n    * [News archive](/category/events/news-5)\n\n### [Top tips to setting up a remote office during Coronavirus](/news/news-\narchive/top-tips-to-setting-a-remote-office-during-coronavirus)\n\n  * [![](https://www.onrec.com/sites/onrec/directory/files/styles/news_top_teaser__640x240_/public/wavetackr.jpg?itok=Ww56JhUw)](/news/news-archive/wavetrackr%E2%80%99s-2020-annual-report-reveals-recruitment-industry-insights)\n\n    * 21 Feb 2020\n|\n\n    * [News archive](/category/events/news-5)\n\n### [WaveTrackR\u2019s 2020 Annual Report reveals recruitment industry\ninsights](/news/news-archive/wavetrackr%E2%80%99s-2020-annual-report-reveals-\nrecruitment-industry-insights)\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n  * [News](/news/all)\n  * [Directory](/directory/overview)\n  * [Pricing plans](/directory/price-plan)\n  * [Advertise](/advertise)\n  * [The Onrec Awards](/awards-categories)\n\n## Stay in touch\n\n  * [Twitter __](https://twitter.com/onrec)\n  * [Onrec LinkedIn Forum __](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=78676)\n  * [Contact us](/contact-us)\n\nOnrec\n\nOnrec is for HR Directors, Personnel Managers, Job Boards and Recruiters\nproviding them with information on the Internet recruitment industry such as\nindustry news, directory and events.\n\nE-mail:\n\n[info@onrec.com](mailto:info@onrec.com)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 ONREC.

In fact,\nrecent research1 revealed 74% of globally surveyed individuals called a\ncontact center in 2019 for assistance.\n\n\u201cThe HR Department handles a wide variety of employee inquiries, from\nsensitive information to recruitment and professional development\nopportunities. The nature of these calls tends to be time sensitive, so it is\ncritical for the telephony platform to direct the caller to the right agent,\u201d\nsays Denis Seynhaeve, 3CLogic\u2019s CEO. \u201cWith the natively-integrated IVR\ndesigner for ServiceNow, employee details are collected upfront and callers\nare automatically routed to the most qualified agent, ensuring more time is\nspent handling the inquiry and less spent waiting in line.\u201d\n\nThe manufacturing firm also plans to extend the ServiceNow certified cloud\ncall center capabilities to its IT and customer service teams leveraging\nServiceNow\u2019s ITSM and CSM suites, with the potential to expand into over 20\ncountries.\n\n**About 3CLogic**\n\n3CLogic is a leading cloud contact center platform modernizing enterprise\ncommunications with their employees and customers.

Once you\u2019re familiar with the basics of marketing strategy,\nyou can zero in on books specific to recruitment marketing.

The book is divided into two parts:\n\n  1. How to build an employer brand and source candidates via print, digital, social, and mobile platforms\n  2. Tools and techniques needed during recruitment as well as tips for a better [onboarding experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/)\n\n  \nWe appreciate the fact that the book has several case studies and best\npractices for those who are new to recruitment marketing.

The book describes how to build a story around\nyour employer brand to attract new clients and customers. Apart from its\nmarketing value, your brand can be used to attract top-tier talent, argue\nauthors Bryan Adams and Dave Hazlehurst.

Author Richard Evans acknowledges that\ncandidates born between the early 80s and the 90s, have a different point of\nview from previous generations. To address this, you need to reimagine your\nemployer brand and turn it into a \u2018talent magnet\u2019.\n\n_The Talent Magnet_ is particularly useful for those starting out in\nrecruitment marketing and in HR as a whole, as it covers a lot of foundational\nconcepts. Given that consumers spend increasingly longer periods on research\nbefore converting, Evans argues that this could influence candidate behavior\nas well. How do you position your company favorably during the research stage\nof a candidate\u2019s recruitment journey? The book answers this critical question\nfrom a millennial-first perspective.\n\n### **4.**[ **On\nRecruitment**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36362460-on-recruitment)  \n\n![Book Cover of On Recruitment](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n_Book Cover of On Recruitment_\n\nThis 144-page treatise by LinkedIn Influencer and veteran trainer/coach, Mitch\nSullivan, is extremely engaging.

Author Kevin Keohane argues that these two\nareas are interconnected. By uniting brand management and recruitment, HR can\nbetter utilize an organization\u2019s reputation for hiring success.\n\nThe book discusses the importance of communication even before an applicant\nmakes the first contact with your brand. This can be achieved via\ncollaboration between HR, marketing, corporate communications, and IT,\nsuggests Keohane. The focal point of his recruitment marketing book is a\n\u201cjoined-up\u201d approach, centered on cross-disciplinary processes. To drive his\npoint home, Keohane shares academic as well as commercial evidence.\n\n### **6.**[ **The Employer Brand: Keeping Faith with the\nDeal**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9332055-the-employer-brand)  \n\n![Book Cover of The Employer Brand](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n_Book Cover of The Employer Brand_\n\nPublished over a decade ago, Helen Rosethorn's book on recruitment marketing\ncontinues to be hugely relevant today. It discusses the need to focus on\n[organizational culture ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/why-culture-is-key-to-building-a-strong-employer-brand/)and why it\nis as important as your product/service offerings. Without being rooted in\nculture, employer branding activities will continue to struggle, says\nRosethorn. That\u2019s why she connects culture, psychology, marketing, employer\nbrand, and business outcomes \u2013 placing the recruitment function within this\ncontext.\n\n_The Employer Brand_ is an excellent read for HR professionals at every end of\nthe learning spectrum, regardless of prior experience. Rosethorn\u2019s arguments\nare bolstered by academic research, presenting a comprehensive picture of how\nemployer brands operate, their role in HR, and their importance to society and\nculture as a whole. As employee aspirations change, a recruitment marketing\nbook of this kind is essential to formulate effective hiring strategies.\n\n### **7.**[ **Social Media Recruitment: How to Successfully Integrate Social\nMedia into Recruitment\nStrategy**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23368015-social-media-\nrecruitment)  \n\n![Book Cover of Social Media Recruitment](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n_Book Cover of Social Media Recruitment_\n\nNo great reading list is complete without a solid how-to guide!

Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n[\u95b1\u8b80\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u672c](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/?p=133950&preview=true)\n\nGiorgio Benassi, Head of talent acquisition \u2013 global production and global\nhuman resources business partner at H&M Group, shares his five-year journey\nwith the global fashion empire and his thoughts on talents in Asia and Europe.\n\n**How would you describe your journey with the H &M group so far? **  \nIt has been a fantastic learning journey, especially around leadership and\nculture. Recently, double- hatting as the global HR business partner, I still\nfeel like my journey at H&M is (closer to) starting than finishing. I have\nbeen here for five years, and there is always something new on the horizon.\n\nThe most memorable moment was meeting CEO Helena Helmersson at a meeting,\nwhere I truly understood what H&M leadership was about. After my presentation,\nI started to compliment her for her achievements at H&M, and in only five\nminutes, she turned the conversation completely on me such as my qualities,\nand how positively my contribution was to the group. When I realised that, I\nstopped and asked her: \u201cHelena, how to you do this? How do you make something\nthat is supposedly to be about you and you make it about me, in such a\npositive way?\u201d\n\n**Having worked across Europe and Hong Kong, what differences do you observe \u2013\nin terms of talent, the pace of change and transformation?**  \nThe pace of the career journey of an Asian talent is very fast, sometimes even\na bit overwhelming. Hong Kong is a quite mature market, but in Mainland China,\nif one strategically plans their career steps, it is not difficult at all to\nmove up the ranks in just a few years. Talent in Europe can also have a fast-\npaced career, but one needs to be really outstanding.\n\n> ##### **This is all due to the economy, not because of the culture. As the\n> economy in Asia is still growing, companies need more talent. **\n\nApart from that, candidate expectations between the two regions also differ.\nThe majority of talent in Asia expect new opportunities from employers, and\nmoney plays an important factor. Europe, on the other hand, is a candidate-\ndriven market. Talent are concerned more\nabouthowtheywillbetreatedandhowinformation is delivered to them. As the Asian\njob market is evolving, talent nowadays have started looking for work-life\nbalance.\n\n**Describe your leadership style**  \nIt\u2019s based on three pillars. First: Authenticity. I am very much who I am at\nwork. People see who I am, both good and bad. This creates a fantastic\nconnection with colleagues.\n\nThe second pillar would be empowerment. I delegate a lot, mostly conceptual\nprojects. I am always there to steer and support, but I allow them to come up\nwith ideas. It empowers people to leverage the competency they have.\n\nThe last one would be creating a light-hearted experience.\n\n> ##### **We need to do our best, but also with a smile. **\n\nAs a leader, I aspire to shelter teams from the overwhelming stress that can\ncome with the corporate world and maintain a light-hearted spirit \u2013 so I can\nput them into the position that they can perform their best work.\n\n**What HR trends should talent acquisition specialists be aware of?**  \nImprove their communication skills, if they are not already excellent, and be\naware of what goes on in the world of tech \u2013 what tech can do for them and how\nthey can optimise it. There is an increasingly strong need for authenticity\nand individualisation \u2013 meaning candidates or clients expect something that is\nnot generic. People want to be seen as who they are, and TA needs to find ways\nto connect with them.\n\nTechnology will be a fantastic enabler of these human relationships. Soon, we\nwill reach a point where we will trust algorithms to do certain parts of our\nselection process. The role of recruiters will then become more mature. They\nwill leverage their human side and strengthen the relationship with\ncandidates.\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

such as supermarkets have faced increased demand in terms\nof recruitment, keeoing workers safe and managing workloads  \nRobin Pope/NurPhoto/PA Images\n\n**With so much focus on furlough and emergency support for struggling\nemployers during the coronavirus crisis, what about those organisations that\nare now faced with unprecedented demand for goods and services, such as\nsupermarkets or smaller essential businesses? Ed Hussey looks at the key HR\nand recruitment considerations.**\n\nAs more businesses shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic, some are being\nforced to lay off workers or furlough them for a temporary time period.\nMeanwhile, other employers such as supermarkets, distribution centres, utility\nrepairers, food bank organisers, care homes and the NHS of course, are seeing\ndemand for services soar to unprecedented levels.\n\n## HR response to coronavirus\n\n**[How HR practitioners are coping in the coronavirus (COVID-19)\npandemic](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/commentary-and-analysis/how-hr-\npractitioners-are-coping-in-the-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-pandemic/165113/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)\n**\n\nFor those experiencing a massive uptick in demand for goods and services,\nthese are incredibly challenging times.\n\nAs well as protecting the interests of existing workers, by adhering to the\nrules surrounding social distancing and providing access to protective\nproducts and equipment, they also need to find a way of scaling up operations\nand recruiting more staff quickly, at a time when absenteeism is rising.\n\nMany large employers, such as the major supermarkets, already have access to\nsignificant HR resources to manage their recruitment processes and they are\nunlikely to be short of candidates.\n\nEven so, recruiting workers at speed, at a time when it is necessary to\nminimise use of physical interviews, is not a straightforward matter.\n\nEssential checks of individual candidates must continue to be carried out, no\nmatter what, but it may be possible to adapt online processes to assist\nindividuals in making more complete online applications. Some employers have\nintroduced more focused \u2018key questions\u2019 to guide individuals in making an\napplication quickly, uploading required documents and using video-based\ninterviewing as they do so.\n\n## Seeking support\n\nFor smaller employers operating essential services, such as care homes and\nfoodbank organisers, access to HR resources may be more of an issue. These\nemployers may need to reach out for support to help them to hire the\nadditional staff they need to get them through the crisis.\n\nFor retailers that are temporarily shutting up shop but expanding their online\noperations, there may be a need to re-skill workers to support with processing\nonline orders or fulfilling deliveries. In some cases, employers may need to\nselect workers to keep on and re-deploy in this way, while furloughing others.\n\nTo de-risk such decisions, it is important that employers remain objective,\nensuring their selection is well evidenced to avoid potential discrimination\nclaims.\n\nIt is helpful wherever possible to ask the workforce to make the right choices\nfor themselves and their colleagues \u2013 after all, workers will have a better\nidea of each individual\u2019s domestic circumstances and their suitability for\ncontinued working or any new role.\n\nEmployers could find that involving staff in such decision making has a\npositive effect on wellbeing too; allowing workers to feel that they are doing\nsomething practical to help keep the business going.\n\nWhere training is required to re-skill workers quickly, this may also need a\nrethink. Instead of providing traditional training packs and courses, HR\nprofessionals may need to give individuals access to self-training videos or\nother online materials, to \u2018watch and learn\u2019 while at home.\n\nA buddying scheme could also be established to ensure workers in new roles\nlearn from their more experienced counterparts.\n\n## Feeling the pressure\n\nThe longer the lockdown continues, the more pressure points are likely to\nemerge and employers should try to pre-empt these as far as possible. Where\nbusinesses are experiencing high demand, employees are being asked to increase\ntheir workload, at a time when their domestic circumstances have changed\nsignificantly and ways of working have also transformed.\n\nEmployers need to recognise the pressure this is placing on their workforce\nand extend their support \u2013 not just in connection with their individual roles\nand responsibilities, but their home life too. In a busy warehouse or\ndistribution centre for example, managers should aim to be more visible than\nusual, practising \u2018walk and talk\u2019 on the shop floor so they can stay in touch\nwith how workers are feeling.\n\nFor many businesses in the services sector, where remote working has become\nthe new normal, online coffee and chat sessions hosted on Microsoft Teams,\nZoom or Skype for Business can help to increase face time with managers and\nfellow workers; nurturing a sense of community and strengthening team spirit.\nManagers must also stay alert to capacity issues and intervene where necessary\nto ease pressure on individuals.\n\nChecking that workers take regular breaks and have a chance to share their\nexperiences of living through the current crisis, is going to be critical to\nprotect their wellbeing.\n\nThis will ensure that the business bounces back with the support of a strong\nand healthy workforce once things get back to normal.\n\n## HR business partner

Online job sites are now staples in talent acquisition,\nbut[ artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-\nlibrary/downloads/cheat-sheet-artificial-intelligence-free-pdf/) and [machine\nlearning](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/special-\nreport-managing-ai-and-ml-in-the-enterprise-free-pdf/) are elevating the\nrecruiting and hiring landscape.\n\n###  Special Feature\n\n[ ![Special Feature: Managing AI and ML in the\nEnterprise](https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/01/a1aab7b7-c706-4c77-93d5-db80e6066cef/resize/220x165/04724e2023959e9a47a77aae0bec33d2/sf-\naiml2-thumb.jpg) ](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-\nlibrary/whitepapers/managing-ai-and-ml-in-the-enterprise-2020-free-pdf/)\n\n[ Special Feature: Managing AI and ML in the Enterprise\n](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/managing-ai-and-\nml-in-the-enterprise-2020-free-pdf/)\n\nThis ebook, based on the latest ZDNet / TechRepublic special feature, advises\nCXOs on how to approach AI and ML initiatives, figure out where the data\nscience team fits in, and what algorithms to buy versus build.\n\n[Read More](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-\nlibrary/whitepapers/managing-ai-and-ml-in-the-enterprise-2020-free-pdf/)\n\nWhen asked about the current status of AI and machine learning in hiring, Mark\nBrandau, principal analyst on Forrester's CIO team said, \"All vendors are\nmoving in that direction without question. It's the way of the future.\"\n\nThe power of AI lies in its ability to process high volumes of data at fast\nspeeds, improving efficiency and productivity for organizations. Those same\nfeatures and benefits can also be applied to the hiring process.\n\n\"As organizations look to AI and machine learning to enhance their practices,\nthere are two goals in mind,\" said Lauren Smith, vice president in Gartner's\nHR practice. \"The first is how do we drive more efficiency in the process? And\nsecond is just recognizing that we can get better outcomes -- the\neffectiveness of our process can be better in a couple places.\"\n\nMajor [companies across industries](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/popular-\ncompanies-using-ai-to-interview-hire-you/) including Hilton, Humana, AT&T,\nProcter & Gamble, and CapitalOne use AI and machine learning to navigate\nthrough thousands of applications, organize interviews, conduct initial\nscreenings, and more.\n\nNot all organizations are implementing automation to accomplish those tasks,\nbut many are integrating the technology at some capacity, Brandau said.\n\nBelow are some examples of current use cases.\n\n**SEE:**[ **Recruiting and hiring top talent: A guide for business leaders\n(free PDF)**](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-\nlibrary/whitepapers/recruiting-and-hiring-top-talent-a-guide-for-business-\nleaders-free-pdf/) **(TechRepublic)**\n\n## Top 3 AI and machine learning applications in hiring\n\n### 1\\. Talent sourcing\n\nTalent sourcing is one of the most prominent ways companies use the technology\nin recruitment, Smith said.\n\n\"[It identifies] where the talent is that we are looking for. That technology\nis really good at scraping social professional sites, academic information,\nand a variety of different sources to help pinpoint the talent segment that\nyou are looking for,\" Smith said.\n\n\"That's been obviously the gold mine for recruiters as they're looking for\ntalent in an increasingly hyper-competitive labor market,\" she added.\n\n### 2\\. Candidate engagement\n\nAutomation in candidate engagement is the most mature application in\nrecruiting thus far, according to Smith.\n\n\"[AI has] become more prominent as candidates become more like consumers than\nthey were before,\" Smith said.\n\n\"They expect transparency in the process. They expect timely responsiveness to\ntheir questions. Most recruiting functions are not set up to do that well,\"\nSmith said. \"Using things like chat bots instead of recruiters, which\ncommunicate directly with candidates at different stages of the process,\ncommunicate where they are in the process, who they have to interview with\nnext, etcetera.\"\n\n### 3\\. Prospective employee assessment and selection\n\nUsing AI to screen candidates helps narrow down talent, making the hiring\nprocess quicker and more efficient, Smith said.\n\n\"Many organizations get hundreds of thousands of applications for a single\nrole, and that is very overwhelming,\" Smith said. \"Most use resum\u00e9 screening\nto sort through that noise and identify the people they want to bring further\ninto the process.\n\n\"The second part of assessing and selecting is less mature,\" Smith continued.\n\"There's a lot of news headlines around actually using algorithms to assess\nand make the final hire.There's a lot of debate about it in the recruiting\nspace, because it can be more prone to bias. But, that's an area that we see\nsome organizations experimenting with.\"\n\n## AI redefines hiring\n\nDespite the prevalence and usefulness of AI and machine learning in\nrecruitment, the technology will not replace hiring professionals, Brandau\nsaid.\n\nBrandau echoed all of the same AI use cases Smith outlined, but added that\nthese applications don't mean that humans will be eliminated from the process.\n\n\"This is not to replace jobs; this is really to help,\" Brandau said.\n\nAI is meant to expedite manual processes that take recruiters and hiring\nmanagers a lot of time, such as sifting through thousands of applications. The\ntechnology is meant to give human professionals more time to conduct more\nvaluable work.\n\n\"This isn't coming in and saying that the whole thing is going to be done\nautomatically. I don't think that's ever going to be the case,\" Brandau said.\n\"When you think about the talent acquisition process, it's deeply human.\"\n\n\"There has to be human connections in there. Even if some of the processes are\ngetting help from software, that's not going to replace anybody, that's just\ngoing to speed time to hire and maybe find a better candidate at a lower price\nover time,\" Brandau added.\n\n## Also see\n\n  * [2020 Tech conferences and events to add to your calendar (free PDF)](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/downloads/2020-tech-conferences-and-events-to-add-to-your-calendar-free-pdf/) (TechRepublic download)\n  * [Policy pack: Workplace ethics](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/policy-pack-workplace-ethics/) (TechRepublic Premium)\n  * [Remote working 101: Professional's guide to the tools of the trade](https://www.zdnet.com/article/remote-working-101-professionals-guide-to-the-tools-of-the-trade/) (ZDNet)\n  * [5 best standing desk converters for 2020](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/5-best-standing-desk-converters-for-2019/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1c) (CNET)\n  * [The 10 most important iPhone apps of all time](https://download.cnet.com/news/the-10-most-important-iphone-apps-of-all-time/) (Download.com)\n  * [Tech history: Check out our coverage](https://flipboard.com/@techrepublic/tech-history-shb02oefz) (TechRepublic on Flipboard)\n\n### Related Topics:\n\n[ CXO ](/topic/cxo/) [ Digital Transformation ](/topic/digital-\ntransformation/) [ Internet of Things ](/topic/internet-of-things/) [\nInnovation ](/topic/innovation/) [ Enterprise Software ](/topic/enterprise-\nsoftware/) [ Smart Cities ](/topic/smart-cities/)\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n[ ![Macy Bayern](https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/06/12/3a3c46bf-\ndd9b-4955-abaa-71dca60b0346/thumbnail/40x40/470d4b4aefedf060b106a55f53d045c4/macycms.jpg)\n](/meet-the-team/us/macy.bayern/)\n\nBy [ Macy Bayern ](/meet-the-team/us/macy.bayern/) | April 1, 2020 -- 13:13\nGMT (21:13 GMT+08:00) | Topic: [Managing AI and ML in the\nEnterprise](/topic/managing-ai-and-ml-in-the-enterprise/)\n\nShow Comments\n\nLOG IN TO COMMENT\n\n  * [My Profile](/members/preferences/)\n  * [Log Out](/user/logout/)\n\n| [Community Guidelines](http://cbsi.force.com/CBSi/zdnetcommunityfaq)\n\n###  Join Discussion\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\nPlease review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription.\n\nBy registering, you agree to the [Terms of\nUse](http://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/terms-of-use) and acknowledge\nthe data practices outlined in the [Privacy\nPolicy](https://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy/highlights).\n\nYou will also receive a complimentary subscription to the ZDNet's Tech Update\nToday and ZDNet Announcement newsletters.

With the added advantage\nof multiple job portals and social media, candidate sourcing has become a lot\nsimpler, but that has also led to humongous volumes of applications that most\nrecruiters need to scan through. In a hyper-connected world, then, while\nsourcing is not the foremost hurdle, the processes of candidate screening and\nselection need to be revisited. Let\u2019s first look at the definitions of these\ntwo integral recruitment processes.\n\n## **What Is Candidate Screening?**\n\nCandidate screening is the process of reviewing job applications. This comes\nin right after candidate sourcing and involves skimming through resumes and\ncover letters to find the closest applicant-job-description matches keeping in\nmind qualifications, experience, skill sets, and projected candidate-\norganization fit.\n\nDespite major headway in technology, screening still happens to be the most\ntime-intensive aspect of hiring with an average hiring decision taking about\n23 hours of screening time. This is with the current size of recruitment teams\nof about three to four people, and they are predicted to only get smaller as\nmore organizations pick up on the \u201cdoing more with less\u201d philosophy.\n\nAnother metric to keep in mind is that the best talent stays live on the\nmarket for only up to 10 days. All these numbers indicate that screening\nshould start taking a lot less time, a lot sooner!\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is Talent Pipeline? Definition, Management with\nExamples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-\nis-talent-pipeline/)**\n\n### **A 3-step guide to the candidate screening process**\n\n  \nThe process of candidate screening, whether you have a few applicants to\nbrowse through or are skimming through mounds of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, must follow three\nbasic steps \u2013 all depending on a deep understanding of the requirements of the\nrole.\n\nThe primary check that is conducted (whether by the human eye or by artificial\nintelligence) involves a look at the qualifications, which may include work\nexperience, academic background, skills, knowledge base, personality,\nbehavior-indicative traits, and competencies.\n\n#### **Step 1:** **Ticking off the basic or must-have requirements**\n\n  \nThese are mandatory fields that the candidate must qualify in \u2013 for example,\nhaving the legal allowance to work in the country where the role would be\nbased or the need for basic coding skills in a website backend role.\n\nThe question may arise about valuable talent being overlooked if they don\u2019t\nmeet these basic criteria. But this can then become a debate of convenience\n(of less time and a tight checklist) over a possible oversight, and most\norganizations are wise to choose the former in a candidate market as heavily\nfragmented.\n\n**Learn More:** **[The Rise of the Corporate Recruiter: Job Description,\nSalary Expectations, and Key Skills for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/corporate-recruiter-jobdescription-salary-keyskills/)**\n\n#### **Step 2: Scanning for preferred or good-to-have qualifications**\n\n  \nThis step involves looking at resumes that meet the basic requirements a\nlittle deeper to look for qualitative attributes that a candidate might bring\nto the role. These would build a stronger case for the CV, since these extras\nwould enable the candidate to do a better job on the role. For example, having\nprior experience in a warehouse of the same industry would be an added bonus\nfor a warehouse manager.\n\n![ A 3-step guide to the candidate screening process](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 1. A 3-step guide to the candidate screening process_**\n\n#### **Step 3: Matching the holistic picture of the candidate to the role**\n\nThis is probably the first time during the screening that the recruiter looks\nat the candidate as more than just a CV and tries to match a **[more holistic\nemployee persona](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-an-employee-persona/)** (with must-have and good-to-have\nqualifications) to the job description. This is where candidates are\nshortlisted to go onward to the interviewing and testing phase.\n\nHow good your screening process is, has a direct impact on your recruitment\nconversion rates. On average, conversion rates are about 12% (application to\ninterview), 17% (interview to offer), and 89% (offer to acceptance and\nplacement). Thus, if you screened 100 candidates and shortlisted 12 of them\nfor the interview, two would receive an offer, and (hopefully) one would\naccept.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is Talent Acquisition? Definition, Process,\nStrategies, and Best\nPractices](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-acquisition/)**\n\n### **The dual challenge in candidate screening**\n\n  \nIf you ask any recruiter what the two metrics of concern are for them, most\nwould point at toward the quality of hire and the time to fill a vacancy.\nScreening plays an important role in this quality-quantity equation.\n\n#### **1\\. Quality of hire**\n\n  \nThat the quality of hire is an important metric is no surprise, but how do you\nmeasure it? About 50% companies measure the average quality-of-hire metric\nbased on the on-the-job performance of new recruits, 49% take into\nconsideration the rate of turnover, and 43% depend on the satisfaction levels\nof hiring managers to measure the quality of hire.\n\nWhile basic **[applicant tracking systems\n(ATS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-10-ats-2020/)** do not seek to measure the success of hires on\nthe job, there are performance measuring tools that could be integrated with\nscreening tools to allow a retrospective understanding of what went well and\nto identify challenge areas.\n\n#### **2\\. Time to fill**\n\n  \nAs discussed earlier, the recent increase in numbers of applications seen\nacross various sectors has led to one of the biggest challenges of screening\nresumes \u2013 volume. Out of the average 250 applications that any given job is\nbombarded with, 220 are deemed unqualified. Thus, investing almost a whole day\nof screening for a single hire is not something that the average recruiter is\na stranger to.\n\nAn effective ATS tool could prove to be a lifesaver here, especially since it\ncan automate large portions of the process, allowing you to go through and\nkeep track of mindboggling volumes of applications. While we have all heard of\ninefficient keyword filters leading to false positives or to good talent being\neliminated at the preliminary screening, these are essentially human errors\nand cannot be blamed on the ATS. With machine learning (ML)-enabled, AI-based\nATS systems, tech tools can learn and update and prune through filters much\nfaster and with greater accuracy.\n\n### **Smarter candidate screening with technology**\n\nWith the rise of the smart recruiter and of AI recruiting tools,\nadministrative activities that demand a greater investment of time can now be\noutsourced to non-human technology. What seems clear is that any process with\ndirectly quantifiable or distinctly qualifiable input and output mechanisms\nlike screening (where you know exactly what you\u2019re looking for) can now be\nautomated.\n\n#### **1\\. AI-enabled resume-screening**\n\n  \nMost AI-based recruiting software needs to serve the basic requirement of\nintegrating well with existing ATS and **[human capital management (HCM)\nsoftware features](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/top-hcm-software-features/)** and tools. Thus, a big chunk of\nthe recruiters\u2019 time can now be freed up for more strategic selection of\ncandidates. These software usually learn from your past hiring decisions, so\nthe system tends to get better over time as you keep updating and upgrading\nit.\n\nMoreover, besides matching job requirements to all information already present\non a CV, AI screeners can often also pull in public data from social media\nplatforms to gauge a more complete picture of the candidate.\n\n#### **2\\. The AI way to manage high volume**\n\n  \nAI recruiters thrive on volume. The more the data, the more the learning and\nthe better the recommendations over time. Industries such as retail or\ncustomer service-specific roles that tend to deal with huge volumes of\napplications with limited time can benefit a lot from such screening tools.\n\n#### **3\\. Improving quality of hire with AI**\n\n  \nAn array of research data points to the fact that organizations that have\nadopted AI recruiting software have seen an average boost to their performance\nmetrics and a dip in turnover. Furthermore, with more time not spent on\nscreening, recruiters can now focus on analyzing shortlisted candidates\nbetter.\n\nUpgraded AI recruiting tools can check for keyword stuffing and arrive and\nbetter screening decisions, thus upping the reliability of the screening\nprocess. Once through with screening, organizations can now move onward to\neffective candidate selection.\n\n**Learn More:[What Is HR Analytics? Definition, Importance, Key Metrics, Data\nRequirements, and Implementation](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-\nanalytics/what-is-hr-analytics/)**\n\n## **What Is Candidate Selection?**\n\nCandidate selection is the culmination of the 360-degree recruitment process\nand is a result of arriving at the smart decision on whether a candidate has\nthe right experience-knowledge-expertise score based on job-requirements.\n\nCandidate selection is thus about filling a vacancy with the right candidate\nusing objective techniques and measurement tools to gauge their fit within the\norganization, their projected success in the role, and their growth path\nwithin the system.\n\nThe process of candidate selection involves an array of interviews, skills\ntests, psychometric tools, group discussions, and reference checks \u2013 all aimed\nat measuring the candidate\u2019s fitness for the role at hand. In spite of the\nincorporation of mobile-friendly AI-enabled tools to these processes, the\nselection process is being held back. Let\u2019s look at what these factors are and\nhow to elevate candidate selection to provide an engaging **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**.\n\n### **Top 5 candidate selection pitfalls**\n\n  \nIt is not only an organization\u2019s business environment that is dynamic. The job\nmarket is ever-morphing as well \u2013 with the rise of the gig workforce, influx\nof new generations at work, the growing need to adopt fast-evolving\ntechnology, and changing employee and candidate expectations. So, how can the\ncandidate selection process help in elevating the candidate experience? When\nit comes to candidate selection, there are five common pitfalls that\norganizations need to be wary of.\n\n#### **1\\. A loosely tied selection process**\n\n  \nNo matter how strongly the trend of unstructured workforces and work schedules\npick up, lack of structure in the selection process is a definite let-down.\nAlmost two-thirds of the candidate population claims that a selection process\nthat appears to be unplanned would impact how they perceived the employer\nbrand. In a recent Manpower Group survey of 18,000 candidates in 24 markets\ntitled _\u201c Add to Cart: Candidates are Consumers, Too\u201d_ 54% of participants\nstated that the candidate journey they went through would affect whether they\ninvest in the brand\u2019s products or services.\n\nAnd this is a perception that they would hold onto. Besides the outward\nperception, an unstructured selection process would pose obvious problems of\nscalability while also being difficult to replicate.\n\n#### **2\\. Lack of role-specific selection systems**\n\n  \nEvery role is unique, and as they require a specific skills-competencies-\npersonality equation for success, they need a reciprocally unique selection\nprocess too. Adopting a one-size-fits-all approach to the selection where you\nexpect to employ the same testing and measuring tools across roles is a recipe\nfor a mundane, ineffective, and superficial selection process.\n\n#### **3\\. Being over-dependent on the human recruiter**\n\n  \nThis is a challenge that most organizations face when adopting new technology\n\u2013 where does human intervention end and tech take the reins? Recruiters may\nfind it difficult to relinquish the reins but think of all the extra work you\nare putting in despite your investment in technology. Surveys point out that\n57% of job seekers might lose interest and pull out of a lengthy selection\nprocess. Why stick to a long-drawn, time-consuming process when you can keep\nit short, sweet, and mobile?\n\n![Top 5 candidate selection pitfalls](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 2. Top 5 candidate selection pitfalls_**\n\n#### **4\\. Denouncing data**\n\n  \nIt might be difficult to believe, but even in a datafied world, there are\nhiring managers who trust their gut over data. While we are not negating the\nimportance of tapping into our human abilities to sense and perceive how well\na candidate might fit into the organization, it seems risky to not rely on the\ndepth of data that we have access to at present. According to CareerBuilder,\n74% of recruiters admit to hiring the \u201cwrong\u201d candidate at some point.\nMoreover, denouncing data paves the way for biased decisions and besides being\ndifficult to justify, such subjectivity is not something that could help you\naugment your candidate experience.\n\n#### **5\\. Overlooking the candidate experience**\n\n  \nAccording to Glassdoor polls, more than two-thirds of employees feel that\nthere is a discrepancy in the expectations set during their interviews and\ntheir actual job. These inconsistencies, lack of adequate communication and\nfeedback, along with a tedious application process, all add up to dismal\ncandidate experience. Whether you end up hiring that candidate or not, the\nexperience that you have provided stays associated with your brand and rest\nassured, will make its way around the social media whirlpool.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is Onboarding? Definition, Process, Templates, and\nBest Practices](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/)**\n\n### **The Holy Trinity Of Smart Candidate Selection**\n\n  \nNow that we know what the five common pitfalls in candidate selection are,\nlet\u2019s look at the three pillars that uphold the process \u2013 the holy trinity of\nsmart candidate selection if you will. In a market as deeply candidate-driven\nas this, where your employer brand needs to shine, you must bring your A-game\nto attract top talent.\n\nHere are the three key aspects of smart candidate selection:\n\n**1\\. Dependable data:** Having access to the right data can help you upgrade\nany process. Rather than not having enough data backing, our immediate concern\nmight actually be having too much data at hand. It is often easy to get\ndistracted by this data dump, but with AI tools that can sift through piles of\ndata to sniff out the most relevant pieces of information, you can start\nputting the selection puzzle together.\n\n![The holy trinity of smart candidate selection](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 3. The holy trinity of smart candidate selection_**\n\n**2\\. Efficient processes:** The importance of a quick, smooth, and structured\nselection process cannot be stressed enough. This not only helps the candidate\nbut also helps you portray your employer brand as agile and effective, where\nprocesses are carried out without glitches and where the candidate\u2019s time is\nvalued. Greater efficiency reduces waste since it has a direct impact on time\nto hire and cost per hire. Structuring an efficient and engaging process for\nthe candidate becomes a lot easier if you pay attention to the data trends of\ncandidate engagement levels and keep track of the feedback they provide.\n\n**3\\. Focus on candidate experience:** How do you convert brand enthusiasts to\nbrand advocates who can help you drive your employer brand? The experience you\nprovide through the selection process is what could make the difference\nbetween creating a brand advocate and a brand adversary. Interestingly enough,\nthe other two pillars of efficiency and data can improve the experience that a\ncandidate has through the process of recruitment.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is Candidate Management?

withGod / Shutterstock.com\n\n**Employers are putting thousands of staff on furlough to reduce their costs\nand seek to protect their employment during a challenging time, using the\ngovernment\u2019s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Here, we round-up some of the\nannouncements made by several major employers over the past couple of days.**\n\n## British Airways\n\n## Furlough\n\n**[Top 10 HR questions March 2020:\nCoronavirus](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/top-10-hr-questions-\nmarch-2020-coronavirus/)**\n\n**[What you need to know about\nfurlough](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-\ncoronavirus-job-retention-scheme/)**\n\n**[Chancellor announces grants to cover 80% of\nwages](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/chancellor-announces-massive-wage-\nsupport-plan-to-counter-coronavirus-damage/)**\n\nBritish Airways is preparing to furlough 80% of its workforce, around 36,000\nstaff, it has been reported. It is expected to offer staff \u2013 including cabin\ncrew, ground staff, engineers and those in its head office \u2013 80% of their\nwages through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. No staff are expected to\nbe made redundant.\n\nJulie Goodway, an employment lawyer at Thomas Mansfield, said: \u201cBritish\nAirways\u2019 actions are unsurprising given the impact of the pandemic on their\nservices. The staff are being asked to take furlough leave which will mean\nthat they receive up to 80% of their salary, capped at \u00a32,500 while they are\nnot working. It may be better for the staff to take this as the other\nalternative could be redundancy. Nonetheless this is a difficult time for\nemployees.\u201d\n\n## Marks & Spencer\n\nFurloughed staff at Marks & Spencer will receive full pay, the retailer has\nannounced as it revealed a 15% pay increase for shop floor staff still working\nin its food stores. M&S temporarily suspended its clothing and home store\noperations and closed outlet stores last week, while its food and online\nbusinesses remain open.\n\nFurlough on full pay is also being offered to food store employees who are\nvulnerable, pregnant or who have caring responsibilities, should they wish to\nvolunteer for selection.\n\n## M&C Saatchi\n\nInternational advertising agency M&C Saatchi announced to investors that it\nwould be securing government support to furlough staff in the UK, US and\nAustralia. A large proportion of highly-paid staff who were being retained\nwould see reductions to their salaries, while the board and senior management\nteam have agreed to a 20% pay cut.\n\nIt said it would be supporting employees as much as possible, and noted that\nit had \u201c regretfully commenced consultation with a number of employees across\nthe group about possible redundancy before the recent escalation in the\nCovid-19 crisis\u201d.\n\n## Sir Robert McAlpine\n\nConstruction firm Sir Robert McAlpine is preparing to furlough around 50% of\nits 2,000 staff. According to an email seen by Construction Enquirer, the\ncompany said that unless it acted quickly it might run out of cash before the\npandemic is over, putting the business at risk of collapse.\n\nIt said furlough was \u201cthe best opportunity\u201d it had to protect jobs and the\nbusiness. Those retained as \u201cactive workers\u201d would need to take a 20% pay cut,\nwhile the executive board and senior leadership team will take a 40% reduction\nin pay, the email said.\n\n\u201cOur aim is to get as many of you as possible back working full-time as soon\nas we can,\u201d it continued. \u201cWe will be reviewing all decisions relating to\nfurlough and pay on a month by month basis and as soon as we can open our\nsites and return to fully operational status, we will.\u201d\n\n## Disney\n\nWorkers on the set of Disney\u2019s The Little Mermaid remake in the UK are being\nretained under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. According to film\nindustry news website TheWrap, staff have been informed that they will remain\nwithout work until the end of May unless production resumes before then or\ndoes not proceed as planned.\n\nPre-production of the film and several other Disney productions, was shut down\non 13 March.\n\n## Evening Standard\n\nThe London Evening Standard has imposed a 20% pay cut on some staff and\nfurloughed others, in response to declining advertising revenues because of\nthe coronavirus.

This entails not only filling in vacancies but also predicting talent\nrequirements and proactively managing talent.\n\nFor example, with succession planning becoming an effective practice across\nsectors, especially for senior executives, recruiters today need to be able to\nbuild and keep handy a steady **[talent\npipeline](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-\nis-talent-pipeline/)** to fill in those vacancies that cannot be filled\nthrough internal hiring or promotions.\n\nWith the state of flux that characterizes the current talent and business\necosystems, there is a growing need for smarter recruitment strategies. This\ninvolves identifying talent needs, developing ways to source the target talent\ngroup, building an employer brand that can motivate application, applying\nmodern screening and selection technologies, and formulating effective\nonboarding strategies to help new employees succeed.\n\nThere are job aggregators like LinkedIn, Indeed, CareerBuilder, or Google For\nJobs that have currently changed how candidates seek the right roles, how\nsources hunt for the right candidates, and how candidates and recruiters\ninteract.\n\nRecruitment is a conveyor belt of constituent sub-processes, every one of\nwhich has a crucial part to play in getting the best talent on board.\n\nTerms such as staffing, hiring, recruitment, and talent acquisition are often\nused interchangeably. However, there are subtle differences between these\nprocesses.\n\n### **Staffing vs. Hiring vs. Recruiting vs. Talent Acquisition (TA)**\n\n  \nHere\u2019s how recruitment is different from staffing, hiring, and talent\nacquisition.\n\n**Staffing:** A form of focused, (usually) short-term hiring to fulfill a\nspecific requirement. It is operational in nature with a short-term focus.\n\n**Hiring:** Filling a vacancy from a ready pool of job seekers. This method is\ntactical with a focus on short- to medium-term goals.\n\n**Recruiting:** A medium-term focused, linear, and reactive approach to find\nthe best fit for an existing job from a large pool of suitable candidates.\n\n**Talent Acquisition (TA):** The strategic, long-term, and proactive process\nof finding, acquiring, assessing, and hiring candidates to fill roles that are\nrequired to meet present and future organizational goals.\n\n**Learn More:[Talent Acquisition vs. Recruitment: Key Differences and\nSimilarities](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-vs-recruitment/)**\n\n## **The Process of Recruitment**\n\nNow that we understand where recruitment features in the staffing to talent\nacquisition spectrum, let\u2019s delve deeper into the recruitment process.\n\n### **Step 1: Talent-needs assessment**\n\n  \nThis step lays the groundwork on which the process of recruitment rests.\nAnalyzing talent needs leads to two specific outcomes \u2013 the creation of the\njob description and creation of the candidate persona.\n\nJob analysis and talent gap analysis allow insight into what skills and\ncapabilities will be required to fill the positions and to propel the\norganization onward. These processes also help in identifying the best-fit\ncandidate by drawing attention to the primary purpose of the position, the\nessential functions that the new employee will carry out, the minimum\nrequirements needed to perform these functions, and the personality traits\nthat will enable success in the job.\n\nThere are three positive outcomes of an effective job description and\ncandidate profile exercise:\n\n**1\\. A clear map for continuous improvement of the organizational\nstructure:** With detailed, effective job descriptions, it becomes easier to\nconduct an organizational audit, to prune out redundant jobs, and to focus\nmore on the roles that hold importance for the future.\n\n**2\\. Evaluation of competencies required for each role:** In writing the job\ndescription for a position, the competencies required for the role are also\nanalyzed. The idea is to include skill sets that ensure a positive impact\nwithin the organizational structure.\n\n**3\\. Deeper insight into compensation for every level:** Compensation and\n[job satisfaction](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/job-satisfaction-definition-factors-importance-statistics-\nexamples/) are closely linked. While various non-monetary aspects affect an\nemployee\u2019s happiness at work, dissatisfaction with what one is paid is a step\nbackward. A review of the job description and the market at large is necessary\nto understand whether you provide competitive compensation.\n\nAssessing talent needs is the first step in **[full-cycle\nrecruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-full-cycle-recruitment/)** and ensures that all\nrecruitment efforts move in the right direction \u2013 towards recruiting the right\ntalent.\n\n### **Step 2: Talent sourcing**\n\n  \nOnce you have conducted an effective talent gap analysis, the next step of\nrecruitment \u2013 **[talent\nsourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-talent-sourcing/)** \u2013 begins. This is where having a strong employer brand\ncomes into play.\n\nTalent sourcing involves advertising your job vacancy across job portals and\nall possible avenues that can connect you to the target talent pool and\neventually to the right talent. When it comes to sourcing talent, you can rely\non a host of talent pools, including:\n\n  * Employee referrals\n  * Online job portals\n  * Social media portals\n  * Internal job postings\n  * Offline ads in newspapers and magazines\n  * Campus recruitment drives\n  * Website career pages\n\n  \nSourcing is about casting a wide net while keeping in mind what you are\nfishing for. The objective of talent sourcing is to encourage applications and\nto get the target audience to listen, apply, and commit to the process.\n\n**Learn More:** **[How to Become a Smart Recruitment Specialist in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-to-\nbecome-a-smart-recruitment-specialist/)**\n\n### **Step 3: Candidate screening**\n\n  \nAssuming that your sourcing efforts were successful and met with a tsunami of\napplications, it is also fair to assume that a large percentage of these\napplications may be irrelevant.\n\nScreening through the barrage of applications to find the perfect hire is\ncrucial. Candidate screening usually involves the following steps:\n\n**1\\. Preliminary screening: A preliminary screening is essential to save time\nlater in the systems and can now be performed** by artificial intelligence\n(AI)-based recruiting tools. [**Recruitment\nchatbots**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-the-potential-of-chatbots-in-recruiting/) like those by\nAllyO, Xor, and Brazen can have multiple conversations simultaneously and\ncater to any questions that candidates may have. These tools use algorithms to\npick out the most relevant information from the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and establish whether\nor not the candidate matches the job specifications.\n\nThis stage could be very time-consuming if all r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are screened manually.\nAt the same time, the algorithms being used to train AI recruiters need to be\ndynamic enough to completely substitute human screening.\n\n**2\\. Initial interview:** Shortlisted candidates are usually put through a\nshort first-level interview with the HR or the hiring manager either online or\nover the phone. This offers more insights into the person behind the CV while\nalso humanizing the organization for the candidate. With AI assistants that\ncan mimic voices and human behavior, however, an interview with an AI\nrecruiter seems closer to fact than fiction today.\n\n**3\\. Skills and psychometric testing:** Any candidate comes with a skill-set\nsuitcase, a package of potential, and a bag of behaviors. To assess these\npreexisting facets, you need a set of tests and tools to ensure their\nobjectivity, reliability, and validity.\n\n**[Background\nverifications](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/background-\nverification/selecting-the-right-background-verification-partner/)** are also\nconducted to validate all claims the candidate has made and to form a more\nholistic picture of the person behind the persona.\n\n**4\\. Final interview:** This is for the finalists \u2013 the top one or two\ncandidates who have passed all the preceding stages of screening. The final\ninterview is usually with the immediate reporting manager or line manager, the\nHR manager in charge, and depending on the band or level that the employee\nwill be entering, the VP, MD, or CEO of the organization.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Top 10 Recruitment Analytics Tools for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nrecruitment-data-analytics-software/)**\n\nWhile this is a formality, it often helps in gaining different perspectives on\nthe same candidate from different sources. It could also be a good check for\nany red flags that might have been missed.\n\nAfter the final interview, the hiring manager, reporting manager, and\nfunctional heads make a joint decision, having weighed out the pros and cons\nof the final candidates.\n\n**[Recruitment bias](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/recognizing-and-addressing-unconscious-bias-in-the-recruitment-\nhiring-process/)** (whether it is that of projection, confirmation, or of\nobserver expectancy) is a tendency very often observed in this process, which\nis so reliant on our subjective perception of another person. Tools like\nHackerRank and Pymetrics have changed how even the most technical of skills\ncan be assessed without bias through objective tests that have minimum\ndependence on human (tester) intervention and judgment.\n\nWhile technology could surely intervene (though algorithms have often been\nproven to be biased as well), it would be helpful to make those in charge of\nthe screening, selection, and interview process more aware of how bias works\nand how they could be more objective in their decisions.\n\n**Learn More:[At What Stage Should Hiring Algorithms Enter the Recruiting\nProcess?](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/when-\nshould-hiring-algorithms-enter-the-recruiting-process/)**\n\n### **Step 4: The offer letter**\n\n  \nOnce a largely unanimous decision is reached about which of the shortlisted\ncandidates fits the job requirement and all background checks are done, the\noffer letter is finalized. It is drafted based on the expectations of the\ncandidate, the job market and the organization\u2019s culture, budget, and\npractices and then extended to the candidate.\n\nIf all is in keeping with what the candidate had in mind, they accept the\noffer (either in person or online). If not, it may lead to a round of\nnegotiation to come to an agreement that makes sense for both the candidate\nand the organization. If such negotiations fail and the candidate rejects the\noffer, the company either extends the offer to the next-in-line candidate or\nrestarts the recruitment process.\n\n### **Step 5: Onboarding and induction**\n\n  \nOnce the offer letter is accepted, the individual transforms from a candidate\nto an employee. Whether the new employee succeeds and is happy in the new role\nor not is determined greatly by the initial experiences they have in the\norganization. This includes the\n[**onboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) and induction process and how the\nemployee is encouraged and oriented within the fabric of the organization.\n\n**Learn More:[Candidate Screening and Selection Process: The Complete Guide\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-\nis-candidate-screening-and-selection/)**\n\n## **Five Fresh Recruitment Techniques for 2020**\n\nThe general context around recruitment has been evolving in light of newer\ninclusions of technology, changing organizational needs, and growing candidate\nexpectations. With that setting the backdrop, you need fresh recruitment\ntechniques to help you navigate the sea of talent.\n\nHere are five fresh recruitment techniques to engage with top talent in 2020\nand beyond:\n\n### **1\\. Quicker processes: Keep it short and sweet**\n\n  \nThat we do not have very long attention spans or endless patience is a known\nfact. With that in mind, it would be impractical to expect candidates to stick\non and stay engaged and committed to a long-drawn recruitment process.\n\nAn important recruitment technique to keep in mind for the near future is to\nkeep processes as short and meaningful as possible \u2013 no endless wait for\nfeedback, no time spent in deciding what the next step is or who will take the\nnext assessment/interview, and no time invested in admin processes that can\neasily be managed by the right ATS.\n\nA 2016 survey of over 1,000 professionals across fields conducted by\nrecruiting firm Robert Half reported that candidates lose interest in the job\nopening if the process and feedback cycle takes longer than two weeks. The\ntechnique to condense the process effectively into an engaging experience is\nsomething that you must strategize.\n\n### **2\\. Recruitment marketing: Engage passive candidates**\n\n  \nCandidates are customers too, and while some may be on an active job hunt,\nothers may be passively browsing through. The latter group could also have\nyour ideal employee, and it would be unfortunate to miss an opportunity to get\nthe right candidate on board simply because they were not as desperate for a\njob as the others.\n\n**[Recruitment marketing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/affordable-recruitmentmarketingplatforms/)** is as crucial as\nmarketing the products and services that an organization has on offer. This\nneeds to be focused branded marketing of the organizational culture, the job,\nthe career path ahead and the promise of an employee experience worth\ninvesting in.\n\n![Five fresh recruitment techniques for 2020](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 1. Five fresh recruitment techniques for 2020_**\n\n### **3\\. Increased visibility: Get seen across portals**\n\n  \nAccording to studies by the HCM suite solution company ICIMS, 69% of job\nseekers use Google to look for jobs. Moreover, 83% of millennials are even\nmore dependent on Google and online portals for finding the right job.\n\nAs a smart recruiter, engaging top talent would entail making the posting\nvisible across different mediums and portals. The use of effective SEO\nstrategies would be an added bonus in ensuring that the job listings rank\nhigher for jobs searched on Google and other relevant search engines.\n\n### **4\\. Engaging job descriptions: Make them _want_ to apply**\n\n  \nCreating organic buzz and interest around a job opening is a technique that\nyou need to invest in. The job description is a tool that serves a dual\npurpose \u2013 of informing the candidate in detail about the job opening, and of\npiquing the candidates\u2019 interest in the role and the organization.\n\nJob descriptions are often the first piece of communication from the\norganization to a prospective applicant and should be treated and tools of\nbranded marketing to get the right information across. These **[intelligent\njob descriptions](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/ramp-up-your-recruitment-with-intelligent-job-descriptions/)** also\nheave to be in a format and language that resonates with the target talent\naudience.\n\n### **5\\. A well-maintained rejection pile: Re-engage second choices**\n\n  \nRe-engaging with rejected candidates is a great technique to save time and\neffort. All this data should ideally be easily accessible to you, and you\nwould already know the reason each candidate was rejected.\n\nRemember that there may be a few candidates who passed most of the rounds of\ncandidate screening but might not have been selected for some valid reason at\nthe time. This is a useful repository of screened candidates that could help\nyou skip a few steps in the process. This also points to the need of effective\n**[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-management-definition-best-practices/)** (CRM)\nsince rejected candidates are not only useful talent sources but also channels\nfor propagating the employer brand.\n\n## **What Are Recruitment Metrics?**\n\nHaving a recruitment process in place is just where the journey begins.\nRecruitment deals with people (and AI, yes, but still most people) on either\nside and is a dynamic process. The process your organization follows needs to\nbe assessed regularly and tweaked, modified, or completely turned on its head\nin keeping with changing needs in a shifting environment.\n\nRecruitment metrics are tools that measure and assess the performance of every\nstep in the recruitment process against the specified goals that the\norganization wishes to achieve through recruitment.\n\nLet\u2019s take a peek at the eight most important recruitment metrics that you\ncannot do without:\n\n### **1\\. Time to fill**\n\n  \nTime to fill is an important metric, and it can be gauged with ease and\nobjectivity. It is a speed metric that measures the time required for a\nrecruiter to fill a vacancy from the time that the requisition was raised till\nthe offer is accepted.\n\nDelving deeper into the time-to-fill metric reveals the time taken to fill a\nvacancy with the right candidate (though measuring the right-ness might\nrequire further time on the job), the efficiency of the recruitment process,\nand any bottlenecks that may cause a greater lapse of time.\n\n### **2\\. Cost per hire**\n\n  \nCost per hire denotes the average expense of the whole process from sourcing\nto onboarding. While the cost per hire has a major impact on the bottom line\nof large enterprises, for smaller organizations it could have serious\nrepercussions on the annual budget. More often than not, the time to fill a\nrole and the cost go hand in hand. The faster a role is filled, the lesser\nresources need to be earmarked for the process.\n\n![Figure 2. Recruitment metrics](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 2. Recruitment metrics_**\n\n### **3\\. Quality of hires**\n\n  \nThe equation to measure the quality of hires (QoH) is usually the percentage\nof candidates who accepted your offer added to those who stayed (retention\nnumbers) divided by 2. However, you could determine the quality of hire based\non any indicator of quality that makes sense for your organization.\n\nFor example, suppose you decide your indicators are the performance of the new\nemployees, their engagement levels, and their culture fit, then:\n\nQoH = (New hire performance + new hire engagement + culture fit)/3\n\nIf we take hypothetical values for each indicator:  \nQoH = (80% + 85% + 90%)/3  \nQoH = 85%\n\nThis metric also gives you an understanding of the return on investment (ROI)\nfrom the resources invested in the recruitment process by pointing towards a\nclear success percentage.\n\n### **4\\. Source of hire**\n\n  \nSource of hire assesses your usual talent pools \u2013 online job boards or\nportals, professional networks, recruitment agencies, or employee referrals.\nMost **[applicant tracking\nsoftware](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-10-ats-2020/)** (ATS) offers a holistic, detailed picture of\nwhere most candidates were shortlisted and selected from.\n\nATS solutions by Bullhorn, Greenhouse, and SAP SuccessFactors can be applied\nto organizations of varying needs and sizes and customized for seamless\nintegration with existing systems and processes.\n\nKnowing the pros and cons of each source of hire helps you identify high-\nperforming sources and those that are not worth investing in. This metric thus\naims to maximize conversions by focusing efforts and resources on high-yield\nsources.\n\n### **5\\. Rate of conversion**\n\n  \nThe rate of conversion is a direct comparison between the number of candidates\nthat have been offered a job and those who accept the offer. If your offer\nacceptance rate is low, it is likely that your job offer is not competitive or\nyour employer brand not strong enough to influence a job offer acceptance.\n\nRethink your offer in terms of salary, perks, or growth opportunities to keep\nyour candidates from considering your competitors. If your job offers are\nbeing rejected due to salary and you are not in a position to compete with a\nbetter package, then consider options such as flexible work timings, free\nfood, or work from home options.\n\n### **6\\. Rate of attrition**\n\n  \nA high attrition rate \u2013 though it is a result of a complex mix of factors \u2013 is\nan indication that there may be something amiss in the recruitment process,\nand this could end up costing the company heavily.\n\nIncorrect job descriptions or failure to identify committed and loyal\ncandidates are directly linked to higher[ attrition\nrates](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nattrition-complete-guide/), though at times, more covert indicators such as\nthe perception of the employer brand, happiness at work, and belongingness\naffect the metric as well.\n\n### **7\\. Candidate experience**\n\n  \nThe recruitment process greatly impacts the **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\nand paves the way for **[employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience-and-how-to-improve-it/)** as well. How well the process\nmeets candidate expectations of timely communication, honest feedback, and a\nglitch-free system affects the experience each candidate has during\nrecruitment. This experience can affect not only their decision to accept the\noffer letter but also how they behave on the job post acceptance of the offer.\n\nCRM software by vendors such as SmashFly, Avature, Beamery, and Jibe are\ncounted upon by various organizations, which are driven to improve the\nexperience they offer candidates and prospective employees.\n\nEvery touchpoint of your recruiting process is an opportunity to provide a\npositive candidate experience. Candidates who drop out during the process\nshould be asked to provide feedback on why they chose to do so. You can then\nmake amends accordingly to devise a process that is more engaging, efficient,\nand meaningful.\n\n### **8\\. Diversity of hires**\n\n  \nDiversity should be more than a mere legal compliance clause. Yes, equal\nopportunity regulations mandate that organizations hire and encourage\nrepresentation from multiple sociocultural societal segments, but diversity\nneeds to be the mainstay of the culture at work and not just a mandate.\n\nRelooking at recruitment metrics to check whether there was any bias exercised\nwith regard to cast, creed, color, age, religion, race, ethnicity, gender,\nnational origin, disability, sexual orientation, or genetic information is\ninsightful and helps you build a strategy to be more inclusive, organically.\n\nMoreover, diverse workforces are usually alive with different perspectives,\ncontexts and have proven to hold the potential to skyrocket organizational\nsuccess.\n\nA recent study by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) reported that \"increasing\nthe diversity of leadership teams leads to more and better innovation and\nimproved financial performance.\" This study collected data from 1,700\ndifferent companies located across 8 countries, from varying sectors, and with\na wide range in terms of employee strength. The findings are interesting as\ncompanies with more diverse management teams were seen to have 19% higher\nrevenue than those who had homogenous teams.\n\n**Learn More:[5 Expert-Recommended Essentials of a Powerful Talent Acquisition\nStrategy](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/expert-tips-building-talent-acquisition-strategy/)**\n\n## **Recruitment Strategies for 2020**\n\nOnce you locate which mile you are at on the smart recruitment journey, it is\ntime to start taking action to shift towards the right strategies to meet your\nrecruitment goals for 2020.\n\n**[Recruitment strategies](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/top-ten-employee-recruitment-strategies/)** need to be tailored\nto your unique context while addressing multiple parameters. Critical success\nfactors for moving forward in your smart recruitment journey include:\n\n### **1\\. Organizational need**\n\n  \nThe foremost aspect of moving forward in the recruitment journey is to\nestablish the need for a strategy \u2013 a sound business case of why the\norganization needs to transform its recruitment practices. The business case\ncould be built on any or more of several factors depending on\norganizational/business focus:\n\n**Business effectiveness / Productivity goals:** Measuring current recruitment\noutcomes by metrics such as quality of hire, new hire retention, and feedback\nas well as the availability of ready internal talent.\n\n**Operational efficiency** : For organizations with a strong focus on cost,\nbuilding a case based on time to hire, cost per hire, and resources utilized\nor overheads involved will offer valid reasoning to move up the smart\nrecruitment journey.\n\n**Attracting talent:** In this highly competitive environment of talent\ncrunch, diverse workforces, and diverse workplace motivators and expectations,\nthere is a strong need for organizations to seem attractive to candidates.\nSmarter recruitment strategies built around enhancing the employer brand and\n**[employee value\nproposition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-employee-value-proposition-and-how-to-create-a-successful-\nevp-model/)** (EVP) can lead to high recruitment success.\n\n### **2\\. An organization\u2019s technology infrastructure**\n\n  \nThe technology that an organization uses plays a crucial part in how fast it\ncan evolve and move further along the recruitment journey. Let\u2019s look at the\ntechnology-centric aspects that affect recruitment strategies and processes:\n\n**Big data:** In the future of recruitment, the devil is in the data for sure!\nThe availability of and access to **[quality data will make or break the best\nof recruitment\nstrategies](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/using-data-to-optimize-recruitment-budget/)**. Any automation, AI,\nor machine learning (ML) can only be as effective as the data it utilizes.\n\n**Technical Blueprint:** It\u2019s also important to understand the technical\narchitecture of an organization and how recruitment technologies will interact\nor integrate with the existing systems. Mastering the current technology will\nallow you to be an effective early adopter when new technology comes into\nplay.\n\n**Technology-adaptive learning:** With innovations in digital recruitment\ncoming in waves of evolution, it is paramount that people affected stay\nabreast of these changes. You need to have opportunities in place to help\nemployees learn new recruitment technologies faster and to encourage the\napplication of the same at work.\n\n### **3\\. Mindset and skill set of stakeholders**\n\n  \nAs you gear up to face the digital recruitment landscape, you will notice that\nthe associated roles are changing and so are the responsibilities. There is a\nneed for the overall mindset and skillset upgrade across recruitment\nstakeholders \u2013 hiring managers, business leaders, and employees. Some notable\nskills and mindset traits required across the board are:\n\n**Technology orientation:** It is no longer merely the IT team\u2019s role to be\ncomfortable with complex technology. Recruiters and all stakeholders involved\nin hiring need to be conversant with newer technologies, tech-oriented\nplatforms, and digital forms of communication and engagement.\n\n**Relationship building:** As technology takes over most of the regular,\nrepetitive tasks and activities, the role of humans involved in recruitment \u2013\nthe recruiters, interviewers, hiring managers, et al. \u2013 is to be more humane\nand build sustainable relationships with candidates, thereby contributing to\nstrengthening the employer brand.\n\n**Data-based decision-making:** Being able to use available data analysis and\npatterns/trends is necessary to make sound hiring decisions.\n\n### **4\\. Skillset and capabilities of stakeholders**\n\n  \nPeople propel organizations. Keeping that context in mind, let\u2019s look at the\nskills and capabilities within an organization that can help improve\nrecruitment systems:\n\n**Design thinking:** As technology percolates into the recruitment system,\nemployees need to adopt iterative design thinking methods to arrive at the\nright solution that works smarter and faster.\n\n**Predictive analytics and decision sciences:** This is arguably one of the\nmost used skills by today\u2019s smart recruiters. From understanding big data to\nderiving trends to predicting job successes to building models of decision\nmaking \u2013 **[predictive analysis](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-\nanalytics/5-hr-essentials-that-predictive-analytics-will-transform-\ncompletely/)** is key to a smarter recruitment approach.\n\n**Business acumen and understanding:** With recruitment becoming smarter, the\nrecruitment team needs to step into the role of a business partner. They need\nto understand business as well as recruitment. Raising the strategic status of\nsmart recruitment involves better business alignment.\n\n**Problem-solving and influencing skills:** Talent acquisition teams need to\nsolve strategic business challenges with skill and tact, keeping in mind the\ncontext of our dynamic environment and the quickly evolving relationship we\nhave with technology.\n\n**Change management:** Being able to influence critical business stakeholders\nto accept and work towards organization-wide adoption of fast-evolving changes\nis essential for more effective business evolution.\n\n**Consultative selling skills:** Recruiters need to be high-tech, modern-day\nmarketers and effective salespersons. They need to make candidates feel\ncomfortable while effectively selling the company culture and personalizing\ntheir outreach to serve immediate as well as future needs.\n\n**Learn More[How to Succeed with AI in\nRecruiting](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/how-to-succeed-with-ai-in-recruiting/)**\n\n## **Becoming a Smart Recruiter**\n\nThe ability to **[avoid recruiting\npitfalls](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-7-tips-on-avoiding-common-recruitment-pitfalls/)** requires the\nsmart recruiter of 2020 to work in collaboration with the latest technology.\nThe smart recruiter needs to be a change leader and make the shift from\nmanual-mechanical recruitment practices toward smart-predictive recruitment\nstrategies keeping business goals and objectives in mind.\n\nBeing a smart recruiter is about continually evolving, maintaining the passion\nto find the most effective person-organization fit, and coming up with new\nbest practices to ensure recruiting success.\n\n**_What recruitment strategies do you use and why?

Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n[\u95b1\u8b80\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u672c](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/?p=132025&preview=true)\n\nEven though Hong Kong is expected to enter a period of recession in 2020, and\ndespite the COVID-19 outbreak, there has not been a significant dip in hiring\nactivities in quarter one, according to Randstad's latest report.\n\nA total of 69% of Hongkongers expect the economic situation to further\ndeteriorate in 2020. Less than half of respondents (48%) expect their\nemployers to perform better in 2020, than in 2019.\n\nConsidering that Hongkongers typically start looking for jobs after the Lunar\nNew Year, Natellie Sun, managing director of search and selection in Greater\nChina at Randstad, commented that some professionals will choose to prioritise\njob security over a new opportunity with another employer this year.\n\n\u201cDue to the COVID-19 outbreak, we have also seen more companies replace face-\nto-face interviews with video or phone interviews. However, face-to-face\ninterviews are essential when building relationships in Asian culture, and the\nlack of human interaction could significantly slow down the hiring process.\nEmployers would still want to meet with the potential employee to ascertain\nculture and personality fit before making an offer,\u201d she said.\n\nOne in three respondents (33%) had changed employers in the past six months.\nAlmost a quarter of respondents said that they are looking for another job.\nOut of which, 8% are actively looking for a new opportunity.\n\nMany Hongkongers are still expecting pay raises and bonuses. A total of 63% of\nrespondents expect to receive a pay raise and 61% want to receive a one-time\nbonus at the end of their fiscal year.\n\n\u201cHongkongers are very competitive by nature. Job titles and salaries are very\nimportant to local employees, as these elements are seen as a direct\nmeasurement of how well they are doing compared to their peers.\n\n\"A factor contributing to the high bonus expectations could also be from staff\nin customer-facing roles, who were instructed to take unpaid leave as a result\nof the local protests. This group of workers are hoping their employers could\ncompensate them for their loss of income through a one-time bonus,\u201d Sun said.\n\nPhoto/ LA Times\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

(Photo:\nGettyimages)\n\nThe most favourable months for hiring and appraisal \u2014 March and April \u2014 are\nnow turning out to be the most challenging times ever faced by both employers\nand employees.\n[COVID-19](https://indianexpress.com/article/coronavirus/coronavirus-live-\nupdates-india-global-deaths-tablighi-jamaat-nizamuddin-us-italy-\nchina-6346665/) has halted the world and overall economic growth. Most\ncompanies have moved to freeze hiring or have slowed down the process, lay-\noffs are a worry and temporary salary-cuts a reality.\n\nSurveys reveal shifting HR policies where companies are taking the support of\ntechnology to conduct virtual interviews. As per job search website Indeed,\nIndian job-seekers are looking for \u2018remote\u2019, \u2018work from home\u2019 and related\nphrases during their search online. The demand for WFH has increased by over\n261 per cent since February 2020, however, the number of available jobs remain\nrelatively unchanged.\n\nSimilarly, training and internship providing company internshala.com shared\nthere\u2019s a drop of 27 per cent in hiring and the applications for in-office\ninternships has also dropped by 23 per cent due to the lockdown. \u201cHowever, the\nemployers are posting virtual or WFH internships and we have seen a surge of\n30 per cent,\u201d informed Sarvesh Agarwal, founder and CEO, Internshala.\n\n**Read |[IIT, IIM class of 2020: Job offers in hand but up in the air alarm\nbells on campus](https://indianexpress.com/article/jobs/iit-iim-job-offers-\nplacement-season-coronavirus-outbreak-lockdown-6346524/)**\n\nTo manage business expenses, the first casualty seems to be the contract\nworkforce. A survey by Indeed highlights that 50 per cent of Indian businesses\nhave already reduced embedded resources, such as the contract workforce or\nfreelancers. Recruitment has experienced the greatest impact, with 36 per cent\nof the surveyed businesses confirming that they have temporarily suspended\ntheir hiring activities, rising to a sizable number of SMBs and large\nbusinesses now focused only on critical hiring.\n\n### Hiring only for key roles\n\nCompanies are waiting to see the overall impact of\n[coronavirus](https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/) to the economy\nbefore making any major decisions. According to Manit Jain, Chairman, FICCI\nARISE, active job openings overall are going down. In industries like travel,\ntourism and hospitality, which are most severely impacted, there is a total\nfreeze. However, the healthcare, e-commerce and e-learning industries will\nhave comparatively more openings. \u201cIn other sectors, while there may not be a\ntotal freeze, employers are postponing their recruitment plans while they wait\nfor things to settle. They are restricting recruitment to only the most\ncritical positions,\u201d Jain said.\n\nHR firms believe the optimism that they were beginning to sense towards the\nfinancial year 2020-2021 in the\npre-[Covid-19](https://indianexpress.com/about/coronavirus/) scenario has come\nto an abrupt halt. Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder and EVP, TeamLease\nServices, informed that selection and date of joining has now been deferred to\npost-April 15. No definitive dates have been given by the companies yet. \u201cFor\ncandidates, it may be a priority to secure their present jobs wherever they\nare. Moreover, organisations are most likely to wait for a clearer picture to\nemerge before committing themselves to taking any hiring decision at this\nstage,\u201d she remarked.\n\n**Video | Coronavirus: Stage By Stage In\nA[Pandemic](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/pandemic-explained-\nwho-novel-coronavirus-covid19-what-is-a-pandemic-6309727/) | Explained**\n\nAs per Vikram Ahuja, co-founder of HR recruitment firm - Talent500, the\npandemic will hit the industries for anywhere between three to 12 months but\nthere are many who are keeping a futuristic approach. \u201cThere are companies\nthat have viewed this as an excellent time to pick up top talent. They have\nused this opportunity to think of their post-pandemic recovery and regrowth\nphase. And technology will be significantly utilised, in this phase and\nafter,\u201d he commented.\n\nEchoing a similar view, Amit Malik, chief people, operations and customer\nservices officer, Aviva Life Insurance informed that the company, like many\nothers, has limited the hiring process to only critical positions. \u201cSince we\nsupport [social distancing](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/why-\nsocial-distancing-in-data-coronavirus-6313355/), we have suspended all face-\nto-face interviews and are using digital means to contact candidates at this\nstage. The restrictions have also impacted on the logistics of on-boarding new\njoinees, which further intensifies the need to focus on key roles only.\u201d\n\n### Coronavirus outbreak spurred remote hiring\n\nWhen the outbreak news broke, most tech giants like\n[Google](https://indianexpress.com/about/google/),\n[Facebook](https://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/) shifted to online\ninterviews. The recruitment process has now become less physical and more\ndigital. As per industry insiders, Covid-19 and associated social distancing\nnorms are expected to continue even after the lockdown.\n\nAccording to Manit Jain, even before the lockdown, there has been a trend\ntowards telephonic and digital interviews, at least during the initial\nscreening rounds before the final face-to-face interview. \u201cCovid-19 is\naccelerating the trend. More and more employers will now use digital media for\nrecruitment,\u201d he remarked.\n\nFor managing recruitment, employers are using platforms such as Webex, Lync\n([Skype](https://indianexpress.com/about/skype/)), Google Duo, etc, which are\neasily and freely available as acquiring a new platform and set-up is\ndifficult during the lockdown. \u201cThose who are already using AI and computer-\nbased tools such as Hirevue, Gecko.ai, Autoview, etc, will increase their\nusage and post-lockdown, we might witness an increased adoption of such\nplatforms,\u201d opined Jain.\n\n### Be presentable, be creative\n\nRecruitment firms are also trying to make the virtual process interesting.\nSince people are at home and have no access to recruiting drives and events,\nthey believe the need of the hour is to think creatively about effective\nsourcing and screening methods.\n\nSome HR firms have started training candidates on how to present themselves on\nvirtual mediums. \u201cWe\u2019re teaching candidates presentation, communication, and\nstorytelling skills so that they present themselves thoroughly on their side\nof the screen. We\u2019re also educating enterprises on the best practices for\nvideo interviewing, and emphasising on replicating their current processes\nwhile working remotely,\u201d shared Ahuja of Talent 500.\n\n### Tips for online interviews\n\n\u2014 Unlike in-person interviews where you have the opportunity to look the\nperson in the eye, understand nuances through actions and behaviour, a lot is\nlost behind the screen. Therefore, have a good infrastructure set-up to attend\nonline interviews, whether video or audio.\n\n\u2014 Speak clearly and precisely. It is difficult to hold someone\u2019s attention on\nthe other side of the screen. So, it\u2019s important to have your background story\nright, to be able to engage the interviewer about your work experience.\n\n\u2014 You need to build storytelling skills. Learn to represent yourself in a\nmanner where you can showcase your abilities beyond just your CV.\n\n**\ud83d\udce3 _The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

But what about employers?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes our entire approach towards hiring also need to be reimagined to deal\nwith the demands of a future where not even the best futurists can predict\nwhich skills will be needed?\n\nThe old job description standard of \u201c5 to 10 years of relevant experience\u201d\nseems jarringly outdated when entire fields such as social media or big data\nanalysis were only born a few years ago.\n\nMost companies these days find themselves bewildered by an array of thorny new\nchallenges \u2013 how to attract and retain millennials.\n\n**SINGAPORE STRUGGLING WITH RECRUITMENT**\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSingapore seems to be struggling.\n\nLast week a senior leader in the biopharma industry sent me a one-liner email:\n\u201c74 per cent of employees in Singapore plan to leave their organisation soon!\nWhat to do?\u201d\n\nAttached was a report by a Roffey Park Institute and Profile Search &\nSelection studying HR trends in four places \u2013 Singapore, China, Hong Kong and\nAustralia.\n\nComparatively, Singapore came out the worst in many factors \u2013 diversity, lack\nof mental health support, and, of course, the dreaded employee turnover\nstatistic, which showed Singapore having the highest percentage of employees\nconsidering moving jobs \u2013 74 per cent, versus China at 67 per cent, Australia\nat 64 per cent, and Hong Kong at 63 per cent\n\nBut what is the root cause behind the high turnover?\n\n![office busy\nworking](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\nA man in an office. (Photo: Pixabay/StockSnap)\n\n  \n\nOne interesting nugget in the report was that the number one people challenge\nthat HR professionals in Singapore said they faced was \u201crecruiting the right\nstaff\u201d.\n\nSingapore respondents viewed the ability to recruit as much more important\ncompared to their counterparts in the region. In fact, in Australia, HR\nprofessionals did not even cite this factor as amongst the top.\n\nIt got me thinking \u2013 why is recruitment such a challenge in Singapore?\n\nCompanies routinely lament that the talent pool is too entitled, not hungry\nenough and lacks skills. There is no doubt some truth to some of these\ncomplaints. But on the other side of the coin, are companies investing enough\nthought and intentionality into hiring and developing talent?\n\nAre we doing the best we can to attract, support and grow the talent, or are\nwe as employers also being entitled and unrealistic with our expectations of\nhaving the perfect plug-and-play candidates?\n\nOver the past few years, I\u2019ve had a unique vantage point from dealing with\nthousands of employers and job seekers having run the career centre at a large\nuniversity and talent development programmes around the world.\n\nWhile everyone understands the importance of hiring well, these are the top\nfive recruitment mistakes I see in the market today:\n\n **1\\. THE IMPOSSIBLE JOB DESCRIPTION**\n\nI often encounter job descriptions in ads the length of my arm that are\ncomplex to the extreme. Oftentimes these templates were created by some long-\nlost boss, with each successor just piling on more wishes, resulting in a long\nand improbable wishlist.\n\nIn my experience, someone qualified (most likely a HR expert), needs to screen\nall wishlists for sanity.\n\n![office computer work\nlife](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\nWorking on a laptop. (Photo: lukasbieri on Pixabay)\n\n  \n\nDo we really need a hard cutoff of five years of relevant experience or are we\nnarrowing the funnel too early? Some of my best hires had little relevant\nexperience but were fast learners, self-aware and highly motivated\nindividuals.\n\nAnother bugbear of mine is seeing \u201cdegree inflation\u201d. Harvard Business School\ncarried out a study that showed that two-thirds of postings for production\nsupervisors called for bachelor degrees, while at the same time just 16 per\ncent of current production supervisors have one.\n\n### [READ: Commentary: The generalist-specialist job distinction is holding\nmany back](/news/commentary/generalist-specialist-job-skills-knowledge-career-\nadvice-11727566)\n\n### [READ: Commentary: Is a first-class degree really that\nimportant?](/news/commentary/first-class-degree-how-important-first-job--\n11887108)  \n\nSo much research shows that grades are a terrible predictor of workplace\nsuccess, to the extent that many global organisations are scrapping college\ndegree requirements, such as Ernst and Young, which conducted an 18-month\nstudy of employees in 2015 to find that academic success didn\u2019t matter when it\ncomes to how well new hires performed.\n\n **2\\. NO ANALYSIS OF RECRUITMENT TECHNIQUES, NOR TRAINING PEOPLE ON HOW TO\nHIRE**\n\nEmployers routinely spend thousands of dollars on hiring each individual who\nfills their vacant seats, yet hardly actually bother to analyse whether their\nhiring methods actually worked or measure the difference between the success\nof their various approaches whether it is which interview questions are most\ncorrelated to success or which recruitment channels are most effective.\n\n![Two person shaking hands at job interview, work\nmeeting](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n(Photo: Unsplash/rawpixel)\n\n  \n\nMany employers argue it\u2019s impossible to measure job performance well, but even\none or two follow-up questions can be useful. Prof Peter Cappeli from Wharton\nsuggests two simple questions: Do you regret hiring this individual? Would you\nhire her or him again?\n\nI once invited an expert on hiring, to conduct a masterclass for my team. I\ncan honestly say it was one of the most eye-opening, humbling experiences to\nlearn just how biased humans are at recruiting, and how important training is.\n\nOne key takeaway was the importance of structuring interview questions so that\nevery candidate can be assessed on the same basis. It may sound boring, but\ninterview panels who ask exactly the same questions in the same order allow\norganisations to aggregate answers and collect data properly on what works.\n\nUnstructured interviews are the worst predictors of workplace success, mainly\nbecause we unconsciously tend to look for someone like ourselves in interview,\nand favour certain communication styles.\n\n### [READ: Commentary: How can I beat the curse of endless office\nemails?](/news/commentary/emails-how-to-manage-endless-vacation-late-\nnight-12038918)  \n\nI\u2019ve also encountered \u201cschool bias\u201d in Singapore where hiring managers form\nsnap judgements about candidates from certain schools based on stereotypes,\nwhich are downright unfair. Yet many managers have so little training in this\nvery key area of leadership.\n\n **3\\. WHEN \u201cCULTURAL FIT\u201d BECOMES GROUPTHINK**\n\n\u201cCulture eats strategy for breakfast every day\u201d is one of the most overused\ncorporate clich\u00e9s. Culture is important, especially in the context of creating\nan inclusive environment and aligning mindsets.\n\nBut when people hire people who look and think just like the rest of the team,\nit reduces innovation and reduces psychological safety \u2013 because they feel\nthat they can\u2019t put forth a differing opinion without it being held against\nthem.\n\n![office workers at\nwork](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\nOffice professionals at work. (File photo: Unsplash/Mimi Thian)\n\n  \n\nOne of the hidden culprits of groupthink is the well-loved employee referral\nprogramme. Research by sociologists Robert Fernandez, Emilio Castilla and Paul\nMoore found that people hired as referrals were actually not any better than\nother candidates.\n\nThe reason they performed better was because the referrers (their friends)\nwere looking out for them in their early days and giving them useful\ninformation, essentially doing an excellent job with onboarding.\n\nThe study showed that if a referrer left before the new hire began their job,\nthe new hire\u2019s performance was no better than a non-referral. This is why some\ncompanies pay deferred referral bonuses and only if the hire is still there\nafter six months or so.\n\n **4** **. NOT INVESTING IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN**\n\nEmployers need to understand that the majority of Gen X and Ys typically leave\njobs due to a lack of perceived growth and development; it\u2019s not just about\nfinancial rewards or recognition.\n\nThis speaks to the important need for companies to invest in learning and\ntraining, develop a strong talent management programme, be disciplined about\nsuccession planning and measure engagement as an early warning indicator.  \n\n### [READ: Commentary: What 2019\u2019s graduating jobseekers need to know \u2013 four\nrecession-proof strategies](/news/commentary/2019-graduating-job-career-\nadvice-recession-proof-strategies-11648300)\n\nThe top bread-and-butter leadership challenges aren\u2019t about technical\nproblems, they deal with handling pressure, motivating others, aligning\nstakeholder interests, managing politics and driving innovation.\n\nAll of these leadership skills of the future rely on deeply human social\nemotional competencies such as empathy, resilience and self-awareness.\n\n![Woman speaking to a colleague in the\noffice.](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\nWoman speaking to a colleague in the office. (Photo: Unsplash/Mimi Thian)\n\n  \n\nYet these are hardly taught in formal education, which leads to many poor\nmanagers who have gotten where they are due to competent individual\nperformance, but lack the ability to manage complex team and interpersonal\ndynamics, which is essential in today\u2019s hypercompetitive and global\nenvironment.\n\n **5** **. DISCRIMINATING AGAINST \u201cJOB-HOPPERS\u201d AND SENIORS**\n\nI\u2019ve written before about the value of having a diverse array of experiences,\nand how the future requires us to have broad skills and an open mindset.\n\nSo it is key that employers do not reject candidates even before the interview\nstage for having many different jobs (which may be due to a variety of good\nreasons, including having children).\n\n### [READ: Commentary: What you need to know about Career\nMobility](/news/commentary/mid-career-mobility-switch-tips-interview-growth-\nmindsets-11527624)\n\n### [READ: Commentary: Watch for casual ageism and other signs of caustic\nattitudes about older workers](/news/commentary/casual-ageism-retirement-re-\nemployment-cpf-raise-65-11835382)\n\nAnother valuable source of talent is our pioneer generation. Local\nbusinesswoman Janice Lim who set up PioneerCan, an social enterprise for\npeople in their 70s and above, says that older members of the workforce have\nmany advantages especially in the service sector, including higher emotional\nintelligence, a calmer disposition and more loyalty.\n\nNot to mention that they are less likely to be glued to their mobile phones\ntexting at work.\n\n _Crystal Lim-Lange is CEO,[Forest Wolf](https://forestwolf.com/) and co-\nauthor of [Deep Human](https://www.deep-human.com/)._  \n\nSource: CNA/sl\n\n## Tagged Topics\n\n  * [skills](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topic/skills)\n  * [Singapore economy](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topic/singapore-economy)\n  * [hiring](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topic/hiring)\n  * [employers](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topic/employers)\n  * [recession](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topic/recession)\n\n##  Share this content\n\n  *   *   *   *   * \n\n## Bookmark\n\n## More stories for you\n\n### Stay on top of the news with CNA newsletters\n\n### Invalid email address\n\nIt looks like the email address you entered is not valid.\n\nTry Again\n\nThis service is not intended for persons residing in the EU.

While turning the page to a new year can be\nrejuvenating, it also brings its fair share of challenges that impact a\ncompany\u2019s hiring, screening and recruiting process. That\u2019s why it\u2019s vital to\nprepare your recruiting team the right way to ensure a strategic advantage in\nour ever-changing industry.\n\n**Analyze the 2020 Recruiting Environment**\n\nBefore ringing in the new year, determine the recruitment environment by\nanticipating hiring needs for 2020.\n\nTo start, companies need to analyze their business plan and make estimates\nabout how many positions will need to be filled. During this process, consider\nworkplace shifts that may happen as a result of promotions, lateral moves or\nattrition. Not only will it determine the recruitment environment in 2020, it\ncan build pipelines as you go to speak with candidates about potential job\nopportunities for the entire year.\n\nOnce hiring needs are determined, it\u2019s time to look at historical data. When\ndoing this, analyze the average number of applicants, time to hire and\napplicant-processing time for each department with hiring needs. Typically,\nthis information can be found in your applicant-tracking system and can\nprovide useful insights.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n**Also** **see:** **[2020 trends for HR to\nconsider](https://hrexecutive.com/2020-trends-for-hr-to-consider/)**\n\nAs a result, organizations can better forecast hiring needs, which translates\ninto greater efficiency, fewer open positions and a greater likelihood of\nhiring success.\n\n**Finalize Recruitment-Marketing Plan**\n\nToday, LinkedIn isn\u2019t enough. In 2020, refocus efforts on marketing to create\nan irresistible employer brand that engages with more job candidates. This can\nbe accomplished in the following ways:\n\n  * **Revitalizing career sites.** One of the ways to improve recruitment marketing is by revitalizing your career website, which is shown to have the highest percentage of hires. However, a recent report from [Talemetry](https://www.talemetry.com/) showed that many Fortune 500 companies lack career-site maturity. In fact, around 40% of Fortune 500 rely on their ATS only or link jobs to their ATS job-search results and descriptions. By making major improvements to a career site, employers will be able to unlock new opportunities to engage with more high-quality candidates.\n  * **Fine-tune sourcing.** Many companies are overspending on job boards and staffing agencies. These channels account for [nearly half of sourcing spend but yield only 35% of your applicants.](https://www.jobvite.com/products/jobvite-engage/) Combat this by rethinking that spend and strategy. Fortunately, there are many technologies that allow recruiting teams to fine-tune sourcing efforts based on which job-site locations are driving the largest pool of applicants. As a result, recruiters can surpass goals while being more cost-effective.\n  * **Social recruiting.** If social media isn\u2019t part of your recruitment-marketing plan, 2020 is the perfect year to incorporate it. Today, [more than 73% of people age 18-34 have found jobs via social channels,](https://www.jobvite.com/recruiting-process/why-you-need-to-invest-in-a-social-recruiting-strategy/) and [21% of job seekers reported finding their \u201cdream job\u201d through social channels.](https://www.jobvite.com/recruiting-process/why-you-need-to-invest-in-a-social-recruiting-strategy/) In addition to helping recruit top talent, it\u2019s a more affordable option and also tells a story about how your company is treating its employees.\n\n**Implement Conversational Recruiting**\n\nGhosting is no longer just a dating phenomenon. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s\nskyrocketed over the past two years. [In fact, more than 83% of recruiters\nhave experienced \u201cghosting\u201d from applicants during the hiring\nprocess.](http://blog.indeed.com/2019/08/26/ghosting-guide/)\n\nOne of the main reasons job seekers ghost is because many recruiters are still\nusing a single-channel approach, which will not win you the war for talent.\nThese tactics are more transactional than relational and can make the process\ntake longer, which can turn candidates off. In today's day and age, it\u2019s all\nabout building strong candidate relationships by effectively streamlining\ncommunication.\n\nFortunately, recruiters can avoid these problems by implementing a candidate-\ncentric model with \u201cconversational recruiting.\u201d This flips the traditional\nadministrative-centric model to one where candidates are at the center of the\nprocess. To accomplish this, recruiters need to make it easier to connect with\ncandidates and vice versa, with 100% digital and mobile engagement, including\nvideo and social-media networks.\n\nNot only will it deliver an unbeatable candidate experience in the new year,\nbut it will also decrease overall time to hire.\n\n**This Includes Text Messaging**\n\nIn today\u2019s fierce talent market, recruiters need new, innovative tools to talk\nto candidates where they\u2019re already researching and applying for jobs\u2014on their\nphones. That\u2019s why texting offers recruiters an incredible way to connect with\ncandidates in real time and engage in conversations that matter.\n\nWith billions of text messages sent every day, texting is viewed as\nconvenient, less disruptive and more personal, which is why it enjoys the\nhighest read and response rates of all communication channels. Studies also\nshow that today\u2019s candidates would rather text than talk. A [recent Jobvite\nreport](https://web.jobvite.com/FY19_Website_2019JobSeekerNation_LP.html)\nhighlighted that more than 64% of workers who receive a text after applying\nfor a job preferred this type of communication over email or phone call.\n\n**Related:[How to make mobile recruiting work for\nyou](https://hrexecutive.com/how-to-make-mobile-recruiting-work-for-you/)**\n\nNot only does texting help candidates engage with recruiters on their own\nturf, it also allows hiring teams to work more efficiently and reduce time to\nhire with the use of intelligent text-based chatbots. This enables recruiting\nteams to save hundreds of hours not having to schedule and conduct phone\nscreens with unqualified candidates and spend more time engaging in\nconversations that matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n\nIn fact, on average, recruiters who use this technology can disqualify\ncandidates in 52 seconds and save 922 recruiting hours per year\u2014reaching 10\ntimes more candidates per day than before.\n\nIf your recruiting team isn\u2019t taking advantage of [texting or AI-powered\nchatbots](https://hrexecutive.com/leveraging-the-power-of-digital-media-in-\nrecruiting/), then you\u2019re already behind. Now is the time to start building a\nframework that incorporates these tools into your 2020 recruitment process to\nbetter engage with both active and passive candidates.\n\n**Revitalize Onboarding**\n\nStudies have shown that nearly half of new hires leave their new position\nwithin a year. While many factors can play a role in this, a good first\nimpression is important. A bad first day can result in candidates walking out\nthe door, and then you\u2019re back to recruiting for a replacement.\n\nWith U.S. companies devoting an average of 24 days and $4,000 to identify and\nhire each new employee, the incentives to keep that employee in the\norganization are high. Yet, 35% of companies spend no money on onboarding.\nThis needs to change. Onboarding has proven to be effective, yet only a small\nfraction of companies utilize it.\n\n**See also:[Boost retention by making your onboarding program\nstrategic](https://hrexecutive.com/boost-retention-by-making-your-onboarding-\nprogram-strategic/)**\n\nTo fix this, the onboarding process should start from when you\u2019re hired\nthrough the first 90 days and include strategies that make new employees feel\nwelcomed, get socialized and prepared for their role. Furthermore, revitalize\nit by making the process totally digital and centralizing all tasks, which\nallows you to get new hires working more quickly than ever before. Finally,\ndon\u2019t forget to track [employees\u2019\nprogress](https://www.jobvite.com/onboarding/onboarding-is-now-part-of-\nrecruiting/) to tell whether or not your onboarding plan is working and, more\nsignificantly, if your company is retaining new hires.\n\nOverall, taking these steps will reduce administrative costs, improve time to\nproductivity and lead to happier employees.\n\n_Aman Brar is CEO of_[ _Jobvite_](https://www.jobvite.com/).\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fhow-\nto-prepare-your-recruiting-team-for-2020%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+to+prepare+your+recruiting+team+for+2020&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fhow-\nto-prepare-your-recruiting-team-for-2020%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fhow-\nto-prepare-your-recruiting-team-for-2020%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

However, [Human\nResources](https://techwireasia.com/2019/11/what-keeps-hr-managers-from-\nadopting-innovative-technologies/) (HR) is often overlooked, resulting in the\ndepartment being a bit of a laggard when it comes to leveraging the new\ntechnology's potential.\n\nThat should no longer be the case, however, as HR groups are exceptionally\npositioned to profit from AI. And, given that the department is at the center\nof the business, connecting every other function together, ensuring HR is\nfinely-tuned will be crucial to businesses' ongoing digital transformation\ninitiatives.\n\nFrom recruitment to managing relationships within the organization, HR leaders\ncan easily find themselves overwhelmed. Without a solid game plan or the right\nknow-how, HR executives attempting to integrate AI into their workstreams will\nbe setting themselves up for disappointment.\n\nTo execute [AI adoption](https://techwireasia.com/2020/02/mckinsey-what-can-\nwe-learn-from-ai-leaders/) effectively, organizations adopting HR must focus\non areas where its impact will be greatest. Here are some considerations.\n\n### # 1 | Candidate experiences\n\nFirstly, just as with customers, retaining employee loyalty is all about\nfostering the right workplace experience. It then follows that modernizing HR\nmeans customizing, quantifying and maximizing the employee or candidate\u2019s\nexperience. AI tools can help free up the time for HR to provide more personal\nexperiences, by [automating\nprocesses](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/02/26/how-to-\nchoose-automation-thats-best-for-your-business/) such as form-filling and data\nentry.\n\n### # 2 | Optimizing recruitment\n\nHiring processes are lengthy and complicated: hiring managers must sift\nthrough hundreds of resumes before they can narrow down to a smaller\nselection.\n\nAI and Machine Learning can help shorten the process. Based on a set of pre-\ndetermined criteria, AI can do the initial rounds of candidate selection,\nreducing the hiring manager\u2019s workload. This enables companies to quickly\nidentify talents, and scoop them up before competitors do.\n\n### # 3 | Uniting the HR team\n\nEveryone involved in HR, from leaders to employees, ought to have a basic\nknowledge of how AI works. They can begin with understanding how AI and\nautomation technology is being used across industries, such as chatbots in\ncustomer service, or RPA software in finance.\n\nAI can be intimidating, especially for the non-technical person. With a\ndepartment-wide functional AI knowledge, half the battle for the successful AI\nimplementation will already be won. When employees see the value AI brings,\nthey will then be more encouraged to adopt, and even innovate, with AI.\n\nIt is an unfortunate misconception that AI will take the human factor out of\nHR, as AI does just the opposite: by taking care of the more predictable,\nrepetitive tasks, HR employees can focus on building meaningful human\nrelationships.\n\nThis helps a great deal when it comes to designing solutions, as HR can have\nthe time to empathize and understand the needs of employees and gain a better\nunderstanding of where AI can oil the engine, whether in HR or elsewhere in\nthe business.\n\n  \n\n[ ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ](https://techwireasia.com/tag/artificial-\nintelligence/) [ DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION\n](https://techwireasia.com/tag/digital-transformation) [ INNOVATION\n](https://techwireasia.com/tag/innovation)\n\n  \n\n* * *\n\n14\n\nSOCIAL BUZZ\n\n  * [![](https://techwireasia.global.ssl.fastly.net/wp-content/themes/correspondent/assets/images/facebook-icon-round-black.png)](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://techwireasia.com/2020/03/how-hr-stands-to-benefit-from-artificial-intelligence/&title=How HR stands to benefit from artificial intelligence)\n  * [ ![](https://techwireasia.global.ssl.fastly.net/wp-content/themes/correspondent/assets/images/twitter-icon-round-black.png) ](http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+HR+stands+to+benefit+from+artificial+intelligence&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechwireasia.com%2F2020%2F03%2Fhow-hr-stands-to-benefit-from-artificial-intelligence%2F)\n  * [![](https://techwireasia.global.ssl.fastly.net/wp-content/themes/correspondent/assets/images/linkedin-icon-round-black.png)](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://techwireasia.com/2020/03/how-hr-stands-to-benefit-from-artificial-intelligence/&title=How HR stands to benefit from artificial intelligence)\n  * [![](https://techwireasia.global.ssl.fastly.net/wp-content/themes/correspondent/assets/images/reddit_icon-round-black.png)](http://www.reddit.com/submit?urlhttps://techwireasia.com/2020/03/how-hr-stands-to-benefit-from-artificial-intelligence/&title=How HR stands to benefit from artificial intelligence)\n  * [![](https://techwireasia.global.ssl.fastly.net/wp-content/themes/correspondent/assets/images/weibo-icon-round-black.png)](http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=https://techwireasia.com/2020/03/how-hr-stands-to-benefit-from-artificial-intelligence/&title=How HR stands to benefit from artificial intelligence)\n\n* * *\n\n![Emily Wong](https://techwireasia.global.ssl.fastly.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/TW-Emily-Wong.png)\n\nBy **[Emily Wong](https://techwireasia.com/author/emilywong/ \"Posts by Emily\nWong\")**\n\n**[Emily Wong](https://techwireasia.com/author/emilywong/ \"Posts by Emily\nWong\")**\n\nEmily is a tech writer constantly on the lookout for cool technology and\nwrites about how small and medium enterprises can leverage it.

It is a dynamic, fluid blueprint for every\nstage and phase of the full recruitment cycle \u2013 an innovative framework that\ninvolves understanding the deficits in present talent as well as the growth\nplans for the future. Recruitment is essentially a sales-driven job and\nsimilar to the need for a sales strategy to attract the target audience,\nrecruitment also needs to strategize a plan of action to attract the right\ntalent. Instead of selling process and services, as is the case with a sales\nstrategy, the recruitment strategy needs to be able to sell the employer\nbrand.\n\nThe scope of hiring is a little different for consultants and for internal\nrecruiters. For example, consultants usually work on retainers or part-time\nprojects for a few roles across their client organizations. Their strategies\nneed to change based on the client and the role. For internal recruiters, on\nthe other hand, the broader strategy pieces remain the same although they need\nto be tweaked for specific roles. For instance, the strategies for hunting for\na warehouse manager, a structural engineer, a web developer or an SEO expert\nall need to be relevant to the job roles while still catering to the broader\nbranding of the organization.\n\n**Learn more:** **[What is recruitment?

Having the right recruitment strategies\nprovide the following advantages in today\u2019s competitive talent battle:\n\n![why you need a hiring strategy](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n  * **Lower cost** with regard to time and money since you already have the first steps chalked out\n  * **Objective decisions** that are business-focused because having a guiding strategy leaves little room for bias\n  * **Data-backed expertise** for every stage of the recruitment process based on the strategic knowledge of the ecosystem\n  * An **acumen for agility** with the basic groundwork in place along with the allowance to fine-tune where necessary on-demand\n  * A **competitive advantage** based on studying the market, the upcoming trends and action plans to stay ahead of the curve\n\n**Learn More:** **[The Rise of the Corporate Recruiter: Job Description,\nSalary Expectations, and Key Skills for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/corporate-recruiter-jobdescription-salary-keyskills/)**\n\n## **10 employee recruitment strategies for hiring the right talent**\n\nOver the last couple of years, the work ecosystem has changed considerably \u2013\nwith increased generational diversity, a more pronounced amalgamation of\nworking styles and models and a stronger infiltration of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing\n(NLP). With these changes demanding quick adaptation, the recruitment\nstrategies have evolved as well.\n\n### **![10 employee recruitment strategies](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\nHere\u2019s our top ten [employee recruitment\nstrategies](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-employee-recruitment-strategies/) to enable hiring the best\ntalent.\n\n### **1.** **Brand it right**\n\n  \n72 percent of global leaders in recruiting today believe that building an\nemployer brand to reckon with has a positive impact on hiring. Employer\nbranding has grown out of its garb of being a mere buzzword and into a key\nelement of people strategy. With organization review sites becoming a natural\nstop for most candidates early on in the recruitment journey, Glassdoor\u2019s\nclaim that companies on average spend about $129,000 on employer branding does\nnot come as a surprise.\n\nCompanies today are taking the trouble to treat candidates as customers and\ninvesting resources in advertising the brand in a way that builds a connection\nwith prospective applicants. Employer branding is thus one of the initial\nstrategies you need to get right before embarking on a recruitment drive. You\nneed to know what you, as an organization stand for, what you wish to sell you\nthe talent pool and how you can guide their perception of your brand to\nencourage organic interest and motivation to apply.\n\n### **2.** **Prefer a refer**\n\n  \nHaving an effective employee referral policy and system helps you unlock many\nrewards. This converts your employees to **[talent\nsourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-\nis-talent-sourcing/)** touch points. This leads to considerably less time\ntaken to hire, an improvement in the quality of talent, easier onboarding and\ncost savings. Companies often pay a referral bonus to employees whose\nreferrals get onboard and even with that, they end up saving on the cost of a\ntedious talent hunt with internal recruiters or commissions to consultants.\n\nThe core thought behind employee referrals seems to be Jim Rohn idea that we\nare the average of the five people that we interact the most with. That\nassumes that capable employees would have at least two highly capable\nprofessionals in their inner circle. Referrals thus as act as a pre-process\nbackground check. This strategy is especially helpful when it comes to hiring\nindividuals who would be high on person-organization fit since the referring\nemployee would have already thought about that. Moreover, employees also help\nfurther the employer brand in motivating their contact to apply for a certain\njob.\n\n### **3.** **Choose insights over data**\n\n  \nWe live in a world of data abundance. That, however, does not presuppose that\nwe always have access right information in order to make wise decisions. Being\nable to dig out insights from the data dump is thus important. This is\npossible through intelligent analysis of relevant metrics. Most **[Application\nTracking Systems (ATS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-applicant-tracking-systems/)** offer the possibility of a\nwealth of insights. The first step to managing well is to measure well.\nMetrics that have an important bearing on your recruitment strategy include\nthe hiring source, time and cost per hire, job-post to application ratio,\nretention rates, email response rates, application to offer time and ratios\nand the quality of hire based on their performance.\n\nGaining insights into and effectively interpreting these metrics is an\nessential aspect of getting the recruitment strategy right. An insight-focused\napproach helps you make sense of retrospective and real-time data to prepare\nbetter for the future. Even apparently simple things like the percentage of\ncandidates who complete the application allow the organization an opportunity\nto understand what aspects of the process to improve.\n\n**Also Read:** **[How to Become a Smart Recruitment Specialist in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-to-\nbecome-a-smart-recruitment-specialist/)**\n\n### **4.** **Be change-ready**\n\n  \nInnovating the recruitment process continually is a necessity today. Being\nable to adapt quickly is not limited only to the kind of technology employed\nbut also includes the systems and processes engaged in. For example, there are\ncompanies that are replacing the CV with tests. This ends up saving time and a\nwhole step in the full cycle recruitment process by cutting out the need to\nread, analyze and judge a candidate by the CV and jumping straight to a skill-\nbased, person-focused perspective.\n\nBeing in the disruptive, change-hungry, trend-driven environment that we\noperate in, as complex and volatile as it may be, comes with the opportunity\nto engage in trial and error, to learn and to change for the better.\nOrganizations should thus focus not only on finding the right strategies but\nalso on being able to reinvent their approach.\n\n### **5.** **Know your niche**\n\n  \nTapping into niche job portals helps with taking your brand to specific talent\npools that are most relevant. Choosing between LinkedIn, Behance or\nStackOverflow, for example, needs to be a decision keeping in mind what role\nyou\u2019re looking to fill and where the best talent for that role would be in\nconcentration.\n\nMoreover, niche job boards enable your access to better candidates by\nnarrowing down your search. Your recruitment strategy should thus focus on\nidentifying the right candidate pools across online and offline sources.\n\n### **6.** **Be active with the passive**\n\n  \nActively engaging with passive candidates is important especially for building\na robust **[talent\npipeline](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-\nis-talent-pipeline/)**. These are candidates who might not be looking for jobs\nat present but have all the necessary traits, skills and experience that\nyou\u2019re looking for. You need to be able to engage with prospective candidates\nwhether they are actively looking for jobs, casually browsing or satisfied at\ntheir present jobs. Even if this group may not be motivated to apply or have\nan updated CV to share, they could be a part of the workforce plan for the\nfuture.\n\n### **7.** **Communicate with a purpose**\n\n  \nThe job description is usually the first piece of information that most\ncandidates are given access to. Complicated, vague JDs lead to disengagement.\nThe strategy should be to provide the candidate with as much relevant\ninformation as possible. When it comes to communicating with candidates, three\npoints need to be kept in mind - ease, reach and quality. The communication\nalso needs to resonate with the employer brand. The key is thus to find the\nright kind of communication style that would engage the candidate and pique\ntheir interest while providing just the right amount of information without\noverburdening them.\n\n### **8.** **Improve interviews**\n\n  \nInterviews are one of the most important aspects of the recruitment process\nand should get enough attention in your hiring strategy as well. Better\ninterviewing processes can improve the whole candidate experience. This is\noften the first direct contact a candidate has with the organization \u2013 one\nthat is an opportunity for both parties to gain as much information about each\nother. A recent LinkedIn research discovered that for 83 percent of\ncandidates, even if they liked the role and the company, a negative experience\nat the interview stage could change how they felt about continuing with the\nrecruitment process.\n\nIn times where all our opinions have multiple platforms to find expression in,\norganizations need to be careful of the interview experience they provide.\nCandidate reviews could affect the collective perception of the organization\nfor individuals who could be potential candidates in the future and a bad\nreview has a much longer memory shelf-life than a good one. Interviewers need\nto be adequately trained to avoid cookie-cutter questions, to be more open and\nconversational in their approach and to be able to draw out all that they need\nto without making the interviewee uncomfortable.\n\n### **9.** **Reach for the top shelf**\n\n  \nThe only way to get better talent onboard is to aim for better talent \u2013 to\nfocus on the best-fit individuals and not compromise on quality just to save\ntime and money. The right candidate, although expensive, would be an\ninvestment whereas a bad hire would cost the company a lot more. It also helps\nto segregate all your applicants and rank them in order of how well they match\nyour requirements.\n\nYour focus should be on the best-suited handful. Various job portals and ATS\nallow recruiters to qualify and classify candidates based on their job-fit\nwith regard to skills needed, the experience level desired and the kind of\neducational platform preferred. Behavioral aspects need to be kept in mind as\nwell. Quite a few organizations today focus on hiring for attitude and\ntraining for skills. In a job market where there is ample overlap and fluidity\nwith regard to educational disciplines and industry experience, that is an\noutlook that makes sense.\n\n### **10.** **Remember ex-employees**\n\n  \nNever burn bridges. Ex-employees take the least amount of time when it comes\nto **[onboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/)** and orientation. They are\nalready aware of the culture, values, processes, and functioning of the\norganization. Moreover, if they have gained experience in industries similar\nto yours after separating from the organization, they would come back with\nupgraded skills, learning and often a fresher perspective. When you factor in\nthe time it takes the average new hire to become truly productive (about three\nto six months), the time you save in rehiring an ex-employee and getting them\nback in the groove becomes all the more apparent.\n\n**Learn more:[10 Employee Onboarding Checklist Items You Can't Afford to\nMiss](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/employee-\nonboarding-checklist/)**\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nWhile building your recruitment strategy, it is important to bear in mind the\nfollowing questions \u2013 What is the end goal? Do we have the right recruitment\ntools to achieve that goal? What additional research do we need to engage in?\nHow do we measure the performance of our recruitment strategy? How can we\nimprove the strategic framework to hire better?

Adopt These Cutting-edge Recruitment Software Innovations**\n  * **Choosing Wisely in a Crowded Digital Marketplace**\n\n## **What Is Recruitment Software Technology?**\n\nRecruitment technology is defined as a set of tools used to automate the\nhiring process, connecting with a variety of data sources to access the best\nquality candidates. It performs key functions such as screening applicants,\nstreamlining follow-ups, and providing data on the efficiency of your\nrecruitment model.\n\nOver the last few years, the demand for recruitment software and tools has\nshot up dramatically as the labor market becomes fiercer and more complicated.\nCompanies are eager to hire highly skilled workers and drive business\ninnovation, even as the average tenure per employee continues to dip. In fact,\nglobal market research company Fortune Business Insights finds that the\nrecruitment software market will cross $3,000 million by 2025.\n\nInterestingly, recruitment doesn\u2019t always need to be a technology-driven\nprocess. However, if you\u2019re looking for high-quality talent that makes an\nexcellent culture fit, especially during a rapid growth phase, you will\nrequire recruitment software to achieve the right level of efficiency.\n\nRecruitment software doesn\u2019t just help you complete the formalities around\nhiring a candidate. It automates the entire recruitment pipeline right from\ncandidate sourcing and engagement to the final step of onboarding. That\u2019s why\nit has become a staple for the **[modern HR\ntoolkit](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/hr-\ntoolkit-of-the-future/)**.\n\n## **Four Features of Recruitment Software That Should Be on Your Checklist**\n\nGiven the highly crowded nature of the recruitment software marketplace, how\ndo you go about choosing one best suited to your enterprise? Are you aware of\nall the must-have features in any recruitment platform, and future trends in\nthis space?\n\nHere are a few key features that your recruitment software and tools should be\nable to perform:\n\n### **1\\. Plugging into a variety of data sources**\n\n  \nThe recruitment tool of your choice should be able to **integrate with the\nhighest possible number of data sources** , including social media, email, job\nboards, third-party staffing platforms, and several other **[talent\nsourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-talent-sourcing/)** areas. It should also come with the requisite sort-and-\nfilter capabilities to help find the right talent.\n\n### **2\\. Deploying recruitment marketing initiatives**\n\n  \nToday, attracting and retaining candidates closely resembles the process of\nattracting and retaining consumers. That\u2019s why it is a recruitment best\npractice to **approach the hiring process as a sales and marketing campaign**.\n\nRemember to check if a recruitment software supports email automation, job ads\npublishing, video communication, **[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/)** (CRM), and in-app\nmessaging to engage with applicants across the entire hiring journey.\n\n### **3\\. Shortlisting candidate profiles**\n\n  \nWith so many recommendations and leads flowing in from multiple sources, it\ncould be challenging to arrive at **an actionable list of candidates** \u2013 and\nthis is particularly true for bulk-hiring campaigns.\n\nRecruitment software should be able to build a searchable database of\napplicants, perform level-one resume screening, enable multi-channel\ncommunication within the platform, and aid your end-to-end selection process.\n\n### **4\\. Revealing insights into recruitment efficiency**\n\n  \nThis is one of the most significant advantages of using an analytics-driven\nrecruitment software versus legacy manual processes. The tool should be able\nto gather data across the recruitment pipeline to **extract useful insights,**\nsuch as which sourcing strategy is performing the best, whether your\ntime/cost-to-hire is sustainable, and key pain points in the **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**.\n\nOver time, this feature will ensure your recruitment function becomes smarter,\nmore effective, and ready to stand out in a competitive hiring arena.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve looked at the core features of recruitment software, let's turn\nthe spotlight on some of the most prominent players in this space and a few\ndisruptors that are making game-changing strides in recruitment software\ntechnology.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Candidate Screening and Selection Process: The Complete\nGuide for 2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-screening-and-selection/)\n\n## **The Best Recruitment Software and Tools for 2020**\n\nAs technology evolves in leaps and bounds, powerful software and cutting-edge\ninnovation aren\u2019t limited to large enterprises anymore. For example, Software-\nas-a-Service (SaaS) has made it possible to deploy recruitment tools on a pay-\nper-use model, scaling up or down as necessary. APIs also enable easier\nintegrations without any complex back-end development.\n\nAs a result, our list of the best recruitment software for 2020 is a mix of\nenterprise-grade tools as well as smartly designed products for small and\nmedium-sized businesses (SMBs). We have tried to cover the varying needs of\nbusinesses of multiple sizes, and every software has excellent online customer\nreviews. Remember, the best recruitment software for you will depend on your\nunique business requirements \u2013 that\u2019s why the numbering on this list doesn\u2019t\nreflect the ranking of a particular recruitment tool.\n\n![The best recruitment software to set you up for 2020 and\nbeyond](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1.

As a consequence,\nhiring extraordinary talent is vital to our success and can never be taken for\ngranted. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we faced a challenge that\nwas, frankly, relatively new to our now 150-year-old firm. For decades\ninvestment banking had been one of the most sought-after, exciting, and fast-\ngrowing industries in the world. That made sense--we were growing by double\ndigits and had high returns, which meant that opportunity and reward were in\ngreat supply. However, the crash took some of the sheen off our industry; both\ngrowth and returns moderated. And simultaneously, the battle for talent\nintensified--within and outside our industry. Many of the candidates we were\npursuing were heading off to Silicon Valley, private equity, or start-ups.\nFurthermore, we were no longer principally looking for a specialized cadre of\naccounting, finance, and economics majors: New skills, especially coding, were\nin huge demand at Goldman Sachs--and pretty much everywhere else. The wind had\nshifted from our backs to our faces, and we needed to respond.\n\nRelated Video\n\n  * [__Save](/video/6026736199001)\n  * [__Share](/video/6026736199001)\n\nNot long ago the firm relied on a narrower set of factors for identifying \"the\nbest\" students, such as school, GPA, major, leadership roles, and relevant\nexperience--the classic resume topics. No longer. We decided to replace our\nhiring playbook with emerging best practices for assessment and recruitment,\nso we put together a task force of senior business leaders, PhDs in industrial\nand organizational psychology, data scientists, and experts in recruiting.\nSome people asked, \"Why overhaul a recruiting process that has proved so\nsuccessful?\" and \"Don't you already have many more qualified applicants than\navailable jobs?\" These were reasonable questions. But often staying successful\nis about learning and changing rather than sticking to the tried-and-true.\n\nEach year we hire up to 3,000 summer interns and nearly as many new analysts\ndirectly from campuses. In our eyes, these are the firm's future leaders, so\nit made sense to focus our initial reforms there. They involved two major\nadditions to our campus recruiting strategy--video interviews and structured\ninterviewing.\n\n### Asynchronous video interviews.\n\nTraditionally we had flown recruiters and business professionals to\nuniversities for first-round interviews. The schools would give us a set date\nand number of time slots to meet with students. That is most definitely not a\nscalable model. It restricted us to a smaller number of campuses and only as\nmany students as we could squeeze into a limited schedule. It also meant that\nwe tended to focus on top-ranked schools. How many qualified candidates were\nat a school became more important than who were the most talented students\nregardless of their school. However, we knew that candidates didn't have to\nattend Harvard, Princeton, or Oxford to excel at Goldman Sachs--our leadership\nranks were already rich with people from other schools. What's more, as we've\nbuilt offices in new cities and geographic locations, we've needed to recruit\nat more schools located in those areas. Video interviews allow us to do that.\n\nAt a time when companies were just beginning to experiment with digital\ninterviewing, we decided to use \"asynchronous\" video interviews--in which\ncandidates record their answers to interview questions--for all first-round\ninteractions with candidates. Our recruiters record standardized questions and\nsend them to students, who have three days to return videos of their answers.\nThis can be done on a computer or a mobile device. Our recruiters and business\nprofessionals review the videos to narrow the pool and then invite the\nselected applicants to a Goldman Sachs office for final-round, in-person\ninterviews. (To create the video platform, we partnered with a company and\nbuilt our own digital solution around its product.)\n\nThis approach has had a meaningful impact in two ways. First, with limited\neffort, we can now spend more time getting to know the people who apply for\njobs at Goldman Sachs. In 2015, the year before we rolled out this platform,\nwe interviewed fewer than 20% of all our campus applicants; in 2018 almost 40%\nof the students who applied to the firm participated in a first-round\ninterview. Second, we now encounter talent from places we previously didn't\nget to. In 2015 we interviewed students from 798 schools around the world,\ncompared with 1,268 for our most recent incoming class. In the United States,\nwhere the majority of our student hires historically came from \"target\nschools,\" the opposite is now true. The top of our recruiting funnel is wider,\nand the output is more diverse.\n\nBeing a people-driven business, we have worked hard to ensure that the video\ninterviews don't feel cold and impersonal. They are only one component of a\nbroader process that makes up the Goldman Sachs recruitment experience. We\nstill regularly send Goldman professionals to campuses to engage directly with\nstudents at informational sessions, \"coffee chats,\" and other recruiting\nevents. But now our goal is much more to share information than to assess\ncandidates, because we want people to understand the firm and what it offers\nbefore they tell us why they want an internship or a job.\n\nOur structured interview questions are designed to assess 10 core\ncompetencies.\n\nWe also want them to be as well prepared as possible for our interview\nprocess. Our goal is a level playing field. To help achieve it, we've created\ntip sheets and instructions on preparing for a video interview. Because the\nplatform doesn't allow videos to be edited once they've been recorded, we\noffer a practice question before the interview begins and a countdown before\nthe questions are asked. We also give students a formal channel for escalating\nissues should technical problems arise, though that rarely occurs.\n\nWe're confident that this approach has created a better experience for\nrecruits. It uses a medium they've grown up with (video), and most important,\nthey can do their interviews when they feel fresh and at a time that works\nwith their schedule. (Our data shows that they prefer Thursday or Sunday night\n--whereas our previous practice was to interview during working hours.) We\nsuspected that if the process was a turnoff for applicants, we would see a dip\nin the percentage who accepted our interviews and our offers. That hasn't\nhappened.\n\n### Structured questioning and assessments.\n\nHow can you create an assessment process that not only helps select top talent\nbut focuses on specific characteristics associated with success? Define it,\nstructure it, and don't deviate from it. Research shows that structured\ninterviews are effective at assessing candidates and helping predict job\nperformance. So we ask candidates about specific experiences they've had that\nare similar to situations they may face at Goldman Sachs (\"Tell me about a\ntime when you were working on a project with someone who was not completing\nhis or her tasks\") and pose hypothetical scenarios they might encounter in the\nfuture (\"In an elevator, you overhear confidential information about a\ncoworker who is also a friend. The friend approaches you and asks if you've\nheard anything negative about him recently. What do you do?\").\n\nEssentially, we are focused less on past achievements and more on\nunderstanding whether a candidate has qualities that will positively affect\nour firm and our culture. Our structured interview questions are designed to\nassess candidates on 10 core competencies, including analytical thinking and\nintegrity, which we know correlate with long-term success at the firm. They\nare evaluated on six competencies in the first round; if they progress,\nthey're assessed on the remaining four during in-person interviews.\n\nWe have a rotating library of questions for each competency, along with a\nrubric for interviewers that explains how to rate responses on a five-point\nscale from \"outstanding\" to \"poor.\" We also train our interviewers to conduct\nstructured interviews, provide them with prep materials immediately before\nthey interview a candidate, and run detailed calibration meetings using all\nthe candidate data we've gathered throughout the recruiting process to ensure\nthat certain interviewers aren't introducing grade inflation (or deflation).\nWe're experimenting with prehire assessment tests to be paired with these\ninterviews; we already offer a technical coding and math exam for applicants\nto our engineering organization.\n\nWe decided not to pilot these changes and instead rolled them out en masse,\nbecause we realized that buy-in would come from being able to show results\nquickly--and because we know that no process is perfect. Indeed, what I love\nmost about our new approach is that we've turned our recruiting department\ninto a laboratory for continuous learning and refinement. With more than\n50,000 candidate video recordings, we're now sitting on a treasure trove of\ndata that will help us conduct insightful analyses and answer questions\nnecessary to run our business: Are we measuring the right competencies? Should\nsome be weighted more heavily than others? What about the candidates'\nbackgrounds? Which interviewers are most effective? Does a top-ranked student\nat a state school create more value for us than an average student from the\nIvy League? We already have indications that students recruited from the new\nschools in our pool perform just as well as students from our traditional ones\n--and in some cases are more likely to stay longer at the firm.\n\nWhat's next for our recruiting efforts? We receive almost 500,000 applications\neach year. From this pool we hire approximately 3%. We believe that many of\nthe other 97% could be very successful at Goldman Sachs. As a result, picking\nthe right 3% is less about just the individual and increasingly about matching\nthe right person to the right role. That match may be made straight out of\ncollege or years later. We're experimenting with resume-reading algorithms\nthat will help candidates identify the business departments best suited to\ntheir skills and interests. We're looking at how virtual reality might help us\nbetter educate students about working in our offices and in our industry. And\nwe're evaluating various tools and tests to bring even more data into the\nhiring decision process. Can I imagine a future in which companies rely\nexclusively on machines and algorithms to rate resumes and interviews? Maybe,\nfor some. But I don't see us ever eliminating the human element at Goldman\nSachs; it's too deeply embedded in our culture, in the work we do, and in what\nwe believe drives success.\n\nI'm excited to see where this journey takes us. Our 2019 campus class is\nshaping up to be the most diverse ever--and it's composed entirely of people\nwho were selected through rigorous, objective assessments. There's no way we\naren't better off as a result.\n\n## Your Approach to Hiring Is All Wrong\n\n  * [Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter%20cappelli)\n\n  * __Save\n  * __Share\n\n#### Idea in Brief\n\n##### The Problem\n\nEmployers continue to hire at a high rate and spend enormous sums to do it.\nBut they don't know whether their approaches are effective at finding and\nselecting good candidates.\n\n##### The Root Causes\n\nBusinesses focus on external candidates and don't track the results of their\napproaches. They often use outside vendors and high-tech tools that are\nunproven and have inherent flaws.\n\n##### The Solution\n\nReturn to filling most positions by promoting from within. Measure the results\nproduced by vendors and new tools, and be on the lookout for discrimination\nand privacy violations.\n\nBusinesses have never done as much hiring as they do today. They've never\nspent as much money doing it. And they've never done a worse job of it.\n\nFor most of the post-World War II era, large corporations went about hiring\nthis way: Human resources experts prepared a detailed _job analysis_ to\ndetermine what tasks the job required and what attributes a good candidate\nshould have. Next they did a _job evaluation_ to determine how the job fit\ninto the organizational chart and how much it should pay, especially compared\nwith other jobs. Ads were posted, and applicants applied. Then came the task\nof sorting through the applicants. That included skills tests, reference\nchecks, maybe personality and IQ tests, and extensive interviews to learn more\nabout them as people. William H. Whyte, in The Organization Man, described\nthis process as going on for as long as a week before the winning candidate\nwas offered the job. The vast majority of non-entry-level openings were filled\nfrom within.\n\nToday's approach couldn't be more different. Census data shows, for example,\nthat the majority of people who took a new job last year weren't searching for\none: Somebody came and got them. Companies seek to fill their recruiting\nfunnel with as many candidates as possible, especially \"passive candidates,\"\nwho aren't looking to move. Often employers advertise jobs that don't exist,\nhoping to find people who might be useful later on or in a different context.\n\nThe recruiting and hiring function has been eviscerated. Many U.S. companies--\nabout 40%, according to\n[research](https://staging.kornferry.com/media/sidebar_downloads/Measuring-Up-\nA-new-research-report-about-RPO-metrics.pdf) by Korn Ferry--have outsourced\nmuch if not all of the hiring process to \"recruitment process outsourcers,\"\nwhich in turn often use subcontractors, typically in India and the\nPhilippines. The subcontractors scour LinkedIn and social media to find\npotential candidates. They sometimes contact them directly to see whether they\ncan be persuaded to apply for a position and negotiate the salary they're\nwilling to accept. (The recruiters get incentive pay if they negotiate the\namount down.) To hire programmers, for example, these subcontractors can scan\nwebsites that programmers might visit, trace their \"digital exhaust\" from\ncookies and other user-tracking measures to identify who they are, and then\nexamine their curricula vitae.\n\nAt companies that still do their own recruitment and hiring, managers trying\nto fill open positions are largely left to figure out what the jobs require\nand what the ads should say. When applications come--always electronically--\napplicant-tracking software sifts through them for key words that the hiring\nmanagers want to see. Then the process moves into the Wild West, where a new\nindustry of vendors offer an astonishing array of smart-sounding tools that\nclaim to predict who will be a good hire. They use voice recognition, body\nlanguage, clues on social media, and especially machine learning algorithms--\neverything but tea leaves. Entire publications are devoted to what these\nvendors are doing.\n\nThe big problem with all these new practices is that we don't know whether\nthey actually produce satisfactory hires. Only about a third of U.S. companies\nreport that they monitor whether their hiring practices lead to good\nemployees; few of them do so carefully, and only a minority even track cost\nper hire and time to hire. Imagine if the CEO asked how an advertising\ncampaign had gone, and the response was \"We have a good idea how long it took\nto roll out and what it cost, but we haven't looked to see whether we're\nselling more.\"\n\nHiring talent remains the number one concern of CEOs in the most recent\nConference Board Annual Survey; it's also the top concern of the entire\nexecutive suite. PwC's 2017 CEO survey reports that chief executives view the\nunavailability of talent and skills as the biggest threat to their business.\nEmployers also spend an enormous amount on hiring--an average of $4,129 per\njob in the United States, according to Society for Human Resource Management\nestimates, and many times that amount for managerial roles--and the United\nStates fills a staggering 66 million jobs a year. Most of the $20 billion that\ncompanies spend on human resources vendors goes to hiring.\n\nWhy do employers spend so much on something so important while knowing so\nlittle about whether it works?\n\n## Where the Problem Starts\n\nSurvey after survey finds employers complaining about how difficult hiring is.\nThere may be many explanations, such as their having become very picky about\ncandidates, especially in the slack labor market of the Great Recession. But\nclearly they are hiring much more than at any other time in modern history,\nfor two reasons.\n\nThe first is that openings are now filled more often by hiring from the\noutside than by promoting from within. In the era of lifetime employment, from\nthe end of World War II through the 1970s, corporations filled roughly 90% of\ntheir vacancies through promotions and lateral assignments. Today the figure\nis a third or less. When they hire from outside, organizations don't have to\npay to train and develop their employees. Since the restructuring waves of the\nearly 1980s, it has been relatively easy to find experienced talent outside.\nOnly 28% of talent acquisition leaders today report that internal candidates\nare an important source of people to fill vacancies--presumably because of\nless internal development and fewer clear career ladders.\n\nLess promotion internally means that hiring efforts are no longer concentrated\non entry-level jobs and recent graduates. (If you doubt this, go to the\n\"careers\" link on any company website and look for a job opening that doesn't\nrequire prior experience.) Now companies must be good at hiring across most\nlevels, because the candidates they want are already doing the job somewhere\nelse. These people don't need training, so they may be ready to contribute\nright away, but they are much harder to find.\n\nThe second reason hiring is so difficult is that retention has become tough:\nCompanies hire from their competitors and vice versa, so they have to keep\nreplacing people who leave. Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows\nthat 95% of hiring is done to fill existing positions. Most of those vacancies\nare caused by voluntary turnover. LinkedIn data indicates that the most common\nreason employees consider a position elsewhere is career advancement--which is\nsurely related to employers' not promoting to fill vacancies.\n\nThe root cause of most hiring, therefore, is drastically poor retention. Here\nare some simple ways to fix that:\n\n### Track the percentage of openings filled from within.\n\nAn adage of business is that we manage what we measure, but companies don't\nseem to be applying that maxim to tracking hires. Most are shocked to learn\nhow few of their openings are filled from within--is it really the case that\ntheir people can't handle different and bigger roles?\n\n### Require that all openings be posted internally.\n\nInternal job boards were created during the dot-com boom to reduce turnover by\nmaking it easier for people to find new jobs within their existing employer.\nManagers weren't even allowed to know if a subordinate was looking to move\nwithin the company, for fear that they would try to block that person and he\nor she would leave. But during the Great Recession employees weren't quitting,\nand many companies slid back to the old model whereby managers could prevent\ntheir subordinates from moving internally. JR Keller, of Cornell University,\nhas found that when managers could fill a vacancy with someone they already\nhad in mind, they ended up with employees who performed more poorly than those\nhired when the job had been posted and anyone could apply. The commonsense\nexplanation for this is that few enterprises really know what talent and\ncapabilities they have.\n\n#### Protecting Against Discrimination\n\nFinding out whether your practices result in good hires is not only basic to\ngood management but the only real defense against claims of adverse impact and\ndiscrimination. Other than white males under age 40 with no disabilities or\nwork-related health problems, workers have special protections under federal\nand state laws against hiring practices that may have an adverse impact on\nthem. As a practical matter, that means if members of a particular group are\nless likely to be recruited or hired, the employer must show that the hiring\nprocess is not discriminatory.\n\nThe only defense against evidence of adverse impact is for the employer to\nshow that its hiring practices are valid--that is, they predict who will be a\ngood employee in meaningful and statistically significant ways--and that no\nalternative would predict as well with less adverse impact. That analysis must\nbe conducted with data on the employer's own applicants and hires. The fact\nthat the vendor that sold you the test you use has evidence that it was valid\nin other contexts is not sufficient.\n\n### Recognize the costs of outside hiring.\n\nIn addition to the time and effort of hiring, my colleague Matthew Bidwell\nfound, outside hires take three years to perform as well as internal hires in\nthe same job, while internal hires take seven years to earn as much as outside\nhires are paid. Outside hiring also causes current employees to spend time and\nenergy positioning themselves for jobs elsewhere. It disrupts the culture and\nburdens peers who must help new hires figure out how things work.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that outside hiring is necessarily a bad idea. But\nunless your company is a Silicon Valley gazelle, adding new jobs at a furious\npace, you should ask yourself some serious questions if most of your openings\nare being filled from outside.\n\nEmployers are obsessed with new technologies and driving down costs.\n\nA different approach for dealing with retention (which seems creepy to some)\nis to try to determine who is interested in leaving and then intervene.\nVendors like Jobvite comb social media and public sites for clues, such as\nLinkedIn profile updates. Measuring \"flight risk\" is one of the most common\ngoals of companies that do their own sophisticated HR analytics. This is\nreminiscent of the early days of job boards, when employers would try to find\nout who was posting resumes and either punish them or embrace them, depending\non leadership's mood.\n\nWhether companies should be examining social media content in relation to\nhiring or any other employment action is a challenging ethical question. On\none hand, the information is essentially public and may reveal relevant\ninformation. On the other hand, it is invasive, and candidates are rarely\nasked for permission to scrutinize their information. Hiring a private\ndetective to shadow a candidate would also gather public information that\nmight be relevant, yet most people would view it as an unacceptable invasion\nof privacy.\n\n## The Hiring Process\n\nWhen we turn to hiring itself, we find that employers are missing the forest\nfor the trees: Obsessed with new technologies and driving down costs, they\nlargely ignore the ultimate goal: making the best possible hires. Here's how\nthe process should be revamped:\n\n### Don't post \"phantom jobs.\"\n\nIt costs nothing to post job openings on a company website, which are then\nscooped up by Indeed and other online companies and pushed out to potential\njob seekers around the world. Thus it may be unsurprising that some of these\njobs don't really exist. Employers may simply be fishing for candidates.\n(\"Let's see if someone really great is out there, and if so, we'll create a\nposition for him or her.\") Often job ads stay up even after positions have\nbeen filled, to keep collecting candidates for future vacancies or just\nbecause it takes more effort to pull the ad down than to leave it up.\nSometimes ads are posted by unscrupulous recruiters looking for resumes to\npitch to clients elsewhere. Because these phantom jobs make the labor market\nlook tighter than it really is, they are a problem for economic policy makers\nas well as for frustrated job seekers. Companies should take ads down when\njobs are filled.\n\n### Design jobs with realistic requirements.\n\nFiguring out what the requirements of a job should be--and the corresponding\nattributes candidates must have--is a bigger challenge now, because so many\ncompanies have reduced the number of internal recruiters whose function, in\npart, is to push back on hiring managers' wish lists. (\"That job doesn't\nrequire 10 years of experience,\" or \"No one with all those qualifications will\nbe willing to accept the salary you're proposing to pay.\") My earlier research\nfound that companies piled on job requirements, baked them into the applicant-\ntracking software that sorted resumes according to binary decisions (yes, it\nhas the key word; no, it doesn't), and then found that virtually no applicants\nmet all the criteria. Trimming recruiters, who have expertise in hiring, and\nhanding the process over to hiring managers is a prime example of being penny-\nwise and pound-foolish.\n\n### Reconsider your focus on passive candidates.\n\nThe recruiting process begins with a search for experienced people who aren't\nlooking to move. This is based on the notion that something may be wrong with\nanyone who wants to leave his or her current job. (Of the more than 20,000\ntalent professionals who responded to a LinkedIn survey in 2015, 86% said\ntheir recruiting organizations focused \"very much so\" or \"to some extent\" on\npassive candidates; I suspect that if anything, that number has since grown.)\nRecruiters know that the vast majority of people are open to moving at the\nright price: Surveys of employees find that only about 15% are _not_ open to\nmoving. As the economist Harold Demsetz said when asked by a competing\nuniversity if he was happy working where he was: \"Make me unhappy.\"\n\nFascinating evidence from the LinkedIn survey cited above shows that although\nself-identified \"passive\" job seekers are different from \"active\" job seekers,\nit's not in the way we might think. The number one factor that would encourage\nthe former to move is more money. For active candidates the top factor is\nbetter work and career opportunities. More active than passive job seekers\nreport that they are passionate about their work, engaged in improving their\nskills, and reasonably satisfied with their current jobs. They seem interested\nin moving because they are ambitious, not because they want higher pay.\n\nEmployers spend a vastly disproportionate amount of their budgets on\nrecruiters who chase passive candidates, but on average they fill only 11% of\ntheir positions with individually targeted people, according to research by\nGerry Crispin and Chris Hoyt, of CareerXroads. I know of no evidence that\npassive candidates become better employees, let alone that the process is\ncost-effective. If you focus on passive candidates, think carefully about what\nthat actually gets you. Better yet, check your data to find out.\n\n### Understand the limits of referrals.\n\nThe most popular channel for finding new hires is through employee referrals;\nup to 48% come from them, according to LinkedIn research. It seems like a\ncheap way to go, but does it produce better hires? Many employers think so.\nIt's hard to know whether that's true, however, given that they don't check.\nAnd research by Emilio Castilla and colleagues suggests otherwise: They find\nthat when referrals work out better than other hires, it's because their\nreferrers look after them and essentially onboard them. If a referrer leaves\nbefore the new hire begins, the latter's performance is no better than that of\nnonreferrals, which is why it makes sense to pay referral bonuses six months\nor so after the person is hired--if he or she is still there.\n\nA downside to referrals, of course, is that they can lead to a homogeneous\nworkforce, because the people we know tend to be like us. This matters greatly\nfor organizations interested in diversity, since recruiting is the only avenue\nallowed under U.S. law to increase diversity in a workforce. The Supreme Court\nhas ruled that demographic criteria cannot be used even to break ties among\ncandidates.\n\n### Measure the results.\n\nFew employers know which channel produces the best candidates at the lowest\ncost because they don't track the outcomes. Tata is an exception: It has long\ndone what I advocate. For college recruiting, for example, it calculates which\nschools send it employees who perform the best, stay the longest, and are paid\nthe lowest starting wage. Other employers should follow suit and monitor\nrecruiting channels and employees' performance to identify which sources\nproduce the best results.\n\n### Persuade fewer people to apply.\n\nThe hiring industry pays a great deal of attention to \"the funnel,\" whereby\nreaders of a company's job postings become applicants, are interviewed, and\nultimately are offered jobs. Contrary to the popular belief that the U.S. job\nmarket is extremely tight right now, most jobs still get lots of applicants.\nRecruiting and hiring consultants and vendors estimate that about 2% of\napplicants receive offers. Unfortunately, the main effort to improve hiring--\nvirtually always aimed at making it faster and cheaper--has been to shovel\nmore applicants into the funnel. Employers do that primarily through\nmarketing, trying to get out the word that they are great places to work.\nWhether doing this is a misguided way of trying to attract better hires or\njust meant to make the organization feel more desirable isn't clear.\n\n## The Grass Is Always Greener\u2026\n\nOrganizations are much more interested in external talent than in their own\nemployees to fill vacancies. Here are the top channels for quality hires.  \n![R1903B_SPOT_GRASS.png](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/04/R1903B_SPOT_GRASS.png)\n\nMuch better to go in the other direction: Create a smaller but better-\nqualified applicant pool to improve the yield. Here's why: Every applicant\ncosts you money--especially now, in a labor market where applicants have\nstarted to \"ghost\" employers, abandoning their applications midway through the\nprocess. Every application also exposes a company to legal risk, because the\ncompany has obligations to candidates (not to discriminate, for example) just\nas it does to employees. And collecting lots of applicants in a wide funnel\nmeans that a great many of them won't fit the job or the company, so employers\nhave to rely on the next step of the hiring process--selection--to weed them\nout. As we will see, employers aren't good at that.\n\nOnce people are candidates, they may not be completely honest about their\nskills or interests--because they want to be hired--and employers' ability to\nfind out the truth is limited. More than a generation ago the psychologist\nJohn Wanous proposed giving applicants a realistic preview of what the job is\nlike. That still makes sense as a way to head off those who would end up being\nunhappy in the job. It's not surprising that Google has found a way to do this\nwith gamification: Job seekers see what the work would be like by playing a\ngame version of it. Marriott has done the same, even for low-level employees.\nIts My Marriott Hotel game targets young people in developing countries who\nmay have had little experience in hotels to show them what it's like and to\nsteer them to the recruiting site if they score well on the game. The key for\nany company, though, is that the preview should make clear what is difficult\nand challenging about the work as well as why it's fun so that candidates who\ndon't fit won't apply.\n\nIt should be easy for candidates to learn about a company and a job, but\nmaking it really easy to apply, just to fill up that funnel, doesn't make much\nsense. During the dot-com boom Texas Instruments cleverly introduced a\npreemployment test that allowed applicants to see their scores before they\napplied. If their scores weren't high enough for the company to take their\napplications seriously, they tended not to proceed, and the company saved the\ncost of having to process their applications.\n\nIf the goal is to get better hires in a cost-effective manner, it's more\nimportant to scare away candidates who don't fit than to jam more candidates\ninto the recruiting funnel.\n\n### Test candidates' standard skills.\n\nHow to determine which candidates to hire--what predicts who will be a good\nemployee--has been rigorously studied at least since World War I. The\npersonnel psychologists who investigated this have learned much about\npredicting good hires that contemporary organizations have since forgotten,\nsuch as that neither college grades nor unstructured sequential interviews\n(hopping from office to office) are a good predictor, whereas past performance\nis.\n\nSince it can be difficult (if not impossible) to glean sufficient information\nabout an outside applicant's past performance, what other predictors are good?\nThere is remarkably little consensus even among experts. That's mainly because\na typical job can have so many tasks and aspects, and different factors\npredict success at different tasks.\n\nThere is general agreement, however, that testing to see whether individuals\nhave standard skills is about the best we can do. Can the candidate speak\nFrench? Can she do simple programming tasks? And so forth. But just doing the\ntests is not enough. The economists Mitchell Hoffman, Lisa B. Kahn, and\nDanielle Li found that even when companies conduct such tests, hiring managers\noften ignore them--and when they do, they get worse hires. The psychologist\nNathan Kuncel and colleagues discovered that even when hiring managers use\nobjective criteria and tests, applying their own weights and judgment to those\ncriteria leads them to pick worse candidates than if they had used a standard\nformula. Only 40% of employers, however, do any tests of skills or general\nabilities, including IQ. What are they doing instead? Seventy-four percent do\ndrug tests, including for marijuana use; even employers in states where\nrecreational use is now legal still seem to do so.\n\n### Be wary of vendors bearing high-tech gifts.\n\nInto the testing void has come a new group of entrepreneurs who either are\ndata scientists or have them in tow. They bring a fresh approach to the hiring\nprocess--but often with little understanding of how hiring actually works.\nJohn Sumser, of HRExaminer, an online newsletter that focuses on HR\ntechnology, estimates that on average, companies get five to seven pitches\n_every day_ --almost all of them about hiring--from vendors using data science\nto address HR issues. These vendors have all sorts of cool-sounding\nassessments, such as computer games that can be scored to predict who will be\na good hire. We don't know whether any of these actually lead to better hires,\nbecause few of them are validated against actual job performance. That aside,\nthese assessments have spawned a counterwave of vendors who help candidates\nlearn how to score well on them. Lloyds Bank, for example, developed a\nvirtual-reality-based assessment of candidate potential, and JobTestPrep\noffers to teach potential candidates how to do well on it. Especially for IT\nand technical jobs, cheating on skills tests and even video interviews (where\ncolleagues off camera give help) is such a concern that eTeki and other\nspecialized vendors help employers figure out who is cheating in real time.\n\n### Revamp your interviewing process.\n\nThe amount of time employers spend on interviews has almost doubled since\n2009, according to research from Glassdoor. How much of that increase\nrepresents delays in setting up those interviews is impossible to tell, but it\nprovides at least a partial explanation for why it takes longer to fill jobs\nnow. Interviews are arguably the most difficult technique to get right,\nbecause interviewers should stick to questions that predict good hires--mainly\nabout past behavior or performance that's relevant to the tasks of the job--\nand ask them consistently across candidates. Just winging it and asking\nwhatever comes to mind is next to useless.\n\nMore important, interviews are where biases most easily show up, because\ninterviewers do usually decide on the fly what to ask of whom and how to\ninterpret the answer. Everyone knows some executive who is absolutely certain\nhe knows the one question that will really predict good candidates (\"If you\nwere stranded on a desert island\u2026\"). The sociologist Lauren Rivera's\nexamination of interviews for elite positions, such as those in professional\nservices firms, indicates that hobbies, particularly those associated with the\nrich, feature prominently as a selection criterion.\n\nInterviews are most important for assessing \"fit with our culture,\" which is\nthe number one hiring criterion employers report using, according to research\nfrom the Rockefeller Foundation. It's also one of the squishiest attributes to\nmeasure, because few organizations have an accurate and consistent view of\ntheir own culture--and even if they do, understanding what attributes\nrepresent a good fit is not straightforward. For example, does the fact that\nan applicant belonged to a fraternity reflect experience working with others\nor elitism or bad attitudes toward women? Should it be completely irrelevant?\nLetting someone with no experience or training make such calls is a recipe for\nbad hires and, of course, discriminatory behavior. Think hard about whether\nyour interviewing protocols make any sense and resist the urge to bring even\nmore managers into the interview process.\n\n### Recognize the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning models.\n\nCulture fit is another area into which new vendors are swarming. Typically\nthey collect data from current employees, create a machine learning model to\npredict the attributes of the best ones, and then use that model to hire\ncandidates with the same attributes.\n\nAs with many other things in this new industry, that sounds good until you\nthink about it; then it becomes replete with problems. Given the best\nperformers of the past, the algorithm will almost certainly include _white_\nand _male_ as key variables. If it's restricted from using that category, it\nwill come up with attributes associated with being a white male, such as\nplaying rugby.\n\nInterviews are where biases most easily show up.\n\nMachine learning models do have the potential to find important but previously\nunconsidered relationships. Psychologists, who have dominated research on\nhiring, have been keen to study attributes relevant to their interests, such\nas personality, rather than asking the broader question \"What identifies a\npotential good hire?\" Their results gloss over the fact that they often have\nonly a trivial ability to predict who will be a good performer, particularly\nwhen many factors are involved. Machine learning, in contrast, can come up\nwith highly predictive factors. Research by Evolv, a workforce analytics\npioneer (now part of Cornerstone OnDemand), found that expected commuting\ndistance for the candidate predicted turnover very well. But that's not a\nquestion the psychological models thought to ask. (And even that question has\nproblems.)\n\nThe advice on selection is straightforward: Test for skills. Ask assessments\nvendors to show evidence that they can actually predict who the good employees\nwill be. Do fewer, more-consistent interviews.\n\n## The Way Forward\n\nIt's impossible to get better at hiring if you can't tell whether the\ncandidates you select become good employees. If you don't know where you're\ngoing, any road will take you there. You must have a way to measure which\nemployees are the best ones.\n\nWhy is that not getting through to companies? Surveyed employers say the main\nreason they don't examine whether their practices lead to better hires is that\nmeasuring employee performance is difficult. Surely this is a prime example of\nmaking the perfect the enemy of the good. Some aspects of performance are not\ndifficult to measure: Do employees quit? Are they absent? Virtually all\nemployers conduct performance appraisals. If you don't trust them, try\nsomething simpler. Ask supervisors, \"Do you regret hiring this individual?\nWould you hire him again?\"\n\nOrganizations that don't check to see how well their practices predict the\nquality of their hires are lacking in one of the most consequential aspects of\nmodern business.\n\n_**Editor 's Note:** A previous version of this article named three\nrecruitment process outsourcing companies, and stated that they utilized\nsubcontractors in India and the Philippines.

The newest development in hiring, which is both promising and\nworrying, is the rise of data science-driven algorithms to find and assess job\ncandidates. By my count, more than 100 vendors are creating and selling these\ntools to companies. Unfortunately, data science--which is still in its infancy\nwhen it comes to recruiting and hiring--is not yet the panacea employers hope\nfor.\n\nVendors of these new tools promise they will help reduce the role that social\nbias plays in hiring. And the algorithms can indeed help identify good job\ncandidates who would previously have been screened out for lack of a certain\neducation or social pedigree. But these tools may also identify and promote\nthe use of predictive variables that are (or should be) troubling.\n\nBecause most data scientists seem to know so little about the context of\nemployment, their tools are often worse than nothing. For instance, an\nastonishing percentage build their models by simply looking at attributes of\nthe \"best performers\" in workplaces and then identifying which job candidates\nhave the same attributes. They use anything that's easy to measure: facial\nexpressions, word choice, comments on social media, and so forth. But a\nfailure to check for any real difference between high-performing and low-\nperforming employees on these attributes limits their usefulness. Furthermore,\nscooping up data from social media or the websites people have visited also\nraises important questions about privacy. True, the information can be\naccessed legally; but the individuals who created the postings didn't intend\nor authorize them to be used for such purposes. Furthermore, is it fair that\nsomething you posted as an undergrad can end up driving your hiring algorithm\na generation later?\n\nAnother problem with machine learning approaches is that few employers collect\nthe large volumes of data--number of hires, performance appraisals, and so on\n--that the algorithms require to make accurate predictions. Although vendors\ncan theoretically overcome that hurdle by aggregating data from many\nemployers, they don't really know whether individual company contexts are so\ndistinct that predictions based on data from the many are inaccurate for the\none.\n\nYet another issue is that all analytic approaches to picking candidates are\nbackward looking, in the sense that they are based on outcomes that have\nalready happened. (Algorithms are especially reliant on past experiences in\npart because building them requires lots and lots of observations--many years'\nworth of job performance data even for a large employer.) As Amazon learned,\nthe past may be very different from the future you seek. It discovered that\nthe hiring algorithm it had been working on since 2014 gave lower scores to\nwomen--even to attributes associated with women, such as participating in\nwomen's studies programs--because historically the best performers in the\ncompany had disproportionately been men. So the algorithm looked for people\njust like them. Unable to fix that problem, the company stopped using the\nalgorithm in 2017. Nonetheless, many other companies are pressing ahead.\n\nThe underlying challenge for data scientists is that hiring is simply not like\ntrying to predict, say, when a ball bearing will fail--a question for which\nany predictive measure might do. Hiring is so consequential that it is\ngoverned not just by legal frameworks but by fundamental notions of fairness.\nThe fact that some criterion is associated with good job performance is\nnecessary but not sufficient for using it in hiring.\n\nTake a variable that data scientists have found to have predictive value:\ncommuting distance to the job. According to the data, people with longer\ncommutes suffer higher rates of attrition. However, commuting distance is\ngoverned by where you live--which is governed by housing prices, relates to\nincome, and also relates to race. Picking whom to hire on the basis of where\nthey live most likely has an adverse impact on protected groups such as racial\nminorities.\n\nUnless no other criterion predicts at least as well as the one being used--and\nthat is extremely difficult to determine in machine learning algorithms--\ncompanies violate the law if they use hiring criteria that have adverse\nimpacts. Even then, to stay on the right side of the law, they must show why\nthe criterion creates good performance. That might be possible in the case of\ncommuting time, but--at least for the moment--it is not for facial\nexpressions, social media postings, or other measures whose significance\ncompanies cannot demonstrate.\n\nIn the end, the drawback to using algorithms is that we're trying to use them\non the cheap: building them by looking only at best performers rather than all\nperformers, using only measures that are easy to gather, and relying on\nvendors' claims that the algorithms work elsewhere rather than observing the\nresults with our own employees. Not only is there no free lunch here, but you\nmight be better off skipping the cheap meal altogether.\n\n* * *\n\n[Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter+cappelli) is the George W.

As a consequence,\nhiring extraordinary talent is vital to our success and can never be taken for\ngranted. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we faced a challenge that\nwas, frankly, relatively new to our now 150-year-old firm. For decades\ninvestment banking had been one of the most sought-after, exciting, and fast-\ngrowing industries in the world. That made sense--we were growing by double\ndigits and had high returns, which meant that opportunity and reward were in\ngreat supply. However, the crash took some of the sheen off our industry; both\ngrowth and returns moderated. And simultaneously, the battle for talent\nintensified--within and outside our industry. Many of the candidates we were\npursuing were heading off to Silicon Valley, private equity, or start-ups.\nFurthermore, we were no longer principally looking for a specialized cadre of\naccounting, finance, and economics majors: New skills, especially coding, were\nin huge demand at Goldman Sachs--and pretty much everywhere else. The wind had\nshifted from our backs to our faces, and we needed to respond.\n\nRelated Video\n\n  * [__Save](/video/6026736199001)\n  * [__Share](/video/6026736199001)\n\nNot long ago the firm relied on a narrower set of factors for identifying \"the\nbest\" students, such as school, GPA, major, leadership roles, and relevant\nexperience--the classic resume topics. No longer. We decided to replace our\nhiring playbook with emerging best practices for assessment and recruitment,\nso we put together a task force of senior business leaders, PhDs in industrial\nand organizational psychology, data scientists, and experts in recruiting.\nSome people asked, \"Why overhaul a recruiting process that has proved so\nsuccessful?\" and \"Don't you already have many more qualified applicants than\navailable jobs?\" These were reasonable questions. But often staying successful\nis about learning and changing rather than sticking to the tried-and-true.\n\nEach year we hire up to 3,000 summer interns and nearly as many new analysts\ndirectly from campuses. In our eyes, these are the firm's future leaders, so\nit made sense to focus our initial reforms there. They involved two major\nadditions to our campus recruiting strategy--video interviews and structured\ninterviewing.\n\n### Asynchronous video interviews.\n\nTraditionally we had flown recruiters and business professionals to\nuniversities for first-round interviews. The schools would give us a set date\nand number of time slots to meet with students. That is most definitely not a\nscalable model. It restricted us to a smaller number of campuses and only as\nmany students as we could squeeze into a limited schedule. It also meant that\nwe tended to focus on top-ranked schools. How many qualified candidates were\nat a school became more important than who were the most talented students\nregardless of their school. However, we knew that candidates didn't have to\nattend Harvard, Princeton, or Oxford to excel at Goldman Sachs--our leadership\nranks were already rich with people from other schools. What's more, as we've\nbuilt offices in new cities and geographic locations, we've needed to recruit\nat more schools located in those areas. Video interviews allow us to do that.\n\nAt a time when companies were just beginning to experiment with digital\ninterviewing, we decided to use \"asynchronous\" video interviews--in which\ncandidates record their answers to interview questions--for all first-round\ninteractions with candidates. Our recruiters record standardized questions and\nsend them to students, who have three days to return videos of their answers.\nThis can be done on a computer or a mobile device. Our recruiters and business\nprofessionals review the videos to narrow the pool and then invite the\nselected applicants to a Goldman Sachs office for final-round, in-person\ninterviews. (To create the video platform, we partnered with a company and\nbuilt our own digital solution around its product.)\n\nThis approach has had a meaningful impact in two ways. First, with limited\neffort, we can now spend more time getting to know the people who apply for\njobs at Goldman Sachs. In 2015, the year before we rolled out this platform,\nwe interviewed fewer than 20% of all our campus applicants; in 2018 almost 40%\nof the students who applied to the firm participated in a first-round\ninterview. Second, we now encounter talent from places we previously didn't\nget to. In 2015 we interviewed students from 798 schools around the world,\ncompared with 1,268 for our most recent incoming class. In the United States,\nwhere the majority of our student hires historically came from \"target\nschools,\" the opposite is now true. The top of our recruiting funnel is wider,\nand the output is more diverse.\n\nBeing a people-driven business, we have worked hard to ensure that the video\ninterviews don't feel cold and impersonal. They are only one component of a\nbroader process that makes up the Goldman Sachs recruitment experience. We\nstill regularly send Goldman professionals to campuses to engage directly with\nstudents at informational sessions, \"coffee chats,\" and other recruiting\nevents. But now our goal is much more to share information than to assess\ncandidates, because we want people to understand the firm and what it offers\nbefore they tell us why they want an internship or a job.\n\nOur structured interview questions are designed to assess 10 core\ncompetencies.\n\nWe also want them to be as well prepared as possible for our interview\nprocess. Our goal is a level playing field. To help achieve it, we've created\ntip sheets and instructions on preparing for a video interview. Because the\nplatform doesn't allow videos to be edited once they've been recorded, we\noffer a practice question before the interview begins and a countdown before\nthe questions are asked. We also give students a formal channel for escalating\nissues should technical problems arise, though that rarely occurs.\n\nWe're confident that this approach has created a better experience for\nrecruits. It uses a medium they've grown up with (video), and most important,\nthey can do their interviews when they feel fresh and at a time that works\nwith their schedule. (Our data shows that they prefer Thursday or Sunday night\n--whereas our previous practice was to interview during working hours.) We\nsuspected that if the process was a turnoff for applicants, we would see a dip\nin the percentage who accepted our interviews and our offers. That hasn't\nhappened.\n\n### Structured questioning and assessments.\n\nHow can you create an assessment process that not only helps select top talent\nbut focuses on specific characteristics associated with success? Define it,\nstructure it, and don't deviate from it. Research shows that structured\ninterviews are effective at assessing candidates and helping predict job\nperformance. So we ask candidates about specific experiences they've had that\nare similar to situations they may face at Goldman Sachs (\"Tell me about a\ntime when you were working on a project with someone who was not completing\nhis or her tasks\") and pose hypothetical scenarios they might encounter in the\nfuture (\"In an elevator, you overhear confidential information about a\ncoworker who is also a friend. The friend approaches you and asks if you've\nheard anything negative about him recently. What do you do?\").\n\nEssentially, we are focused less on past achievements and more on\nunderstanding whether a candidate has qualities that will positively affect\nour firm and our culture. Our structured interview questions are designed to\nassess candidates on 10 core competencies, including analytical thinking and\nintegrity, which we know correlate with long-term success at the firm. They\nare evaluated on six competencies in the first round; if they progress,\nthey're assessed on the remaining four during in-person interviews.\n\nWe have a rotating library of questions for each competency, along with a\nrubric for interviewers that explains how to rate responses on a five-point\nscale from \"outstanding\" to \"poor.\" We also train our interviewers to conduct\nstructured interviews, provide them with prep materials immediately before\nthey interview a candidate, and run detailed calibration meetings using all\nthe candidate data we've gathered throughout the recruiting process to ensure\nthat certain interviewers aren't introducing grade inflation (or deflation).\nWe're experimenting with prehire assessment tests to be paired with these\ninterviews; we already offer a technical coding and math exam for applicants\nto our engineering organization.\n\nWe decided not to pilot these changes and instead rolled them out en masse,\nbecause we realized that buy-in would come from being able to show results\nquickly--and because we know that no process is perfect. Indeed, what I love\nmost about our new approach is that we've turned our recruiting department\ninto a laboratory for continuous learning and refinement. With more than\n50,000 candidate video recordings, we're now sitting on a treasure trove of\ndata that will help us conduct insightful analyses and answer questions\nnecessary to run our business: Are we measuring the right competencies? Should\nsome be weighted more heavily than others? What about the candidates'\nbackgrounds? Which interviewers are most effective? Does a top-ranked student\nat a state school create more value for us than an average student from the\nIvy League? We already have indications that students recruited from the new\nschools in our pool perform just as well as students from our traditional ones\n--and in some cases are more likely to stay longer at the firm.\n\nWhat's next for our recruiting efforts? We receive almost 500,000 applications\neach year. From this pool we hire approximately 3%. We believe that many of\nthe other 97% could be very successful at Goldman Sachs. As a result, picking\nthe right 3% is less about just the individual and increasingly about matching\nthe right person to the right role. That match may be made straight out of\ncollege or years later. We're experimenting with resume-reading algorithms\nthat will help candidates identify the business departments best suited to\ntheir skills and interests. We're looking at how virtual reality might help us\nbetter educate students about working in our offices and in our industry. And\nwe're evaluating various tools and tests to bring even more data into the\nhiring decision process. Can I imagine a future in which companies rely\nexclusively on machines and algorithms to rate resumes and interviews? Maybe,\nfor some. But I don't see us ever eliminating the human element at Goldman\nSachs; it's too deeply embedded in our culture, in the work we do, and in what\nwe believe drives success.\n\nI'm excited to see where this journey takes us. Our 2019 campus class is\nshaping up to be the most diverse ever--and it's composed entirely of people\nwho were selected through rigorous, objective assessments. There's no way we\naren't better off as a result.\n\n* * *\n\n[Dane E.

know!\n\nPosted on 31st March 2020  \n\n _ **Updated 6th April 2020**_\n\nThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced on 20 March 2020 to provide\nsecurity for employees over the coming months in light of the current crisis.\nThe scheme provides a mechanism that allows businesses to retain employees\nwithout the need for them to work and for those employees to still receive a\nminimum level of their salary. The scheme\u2019s purpose is to reduce the amount of\nredundancies and avoid employees being laid off without pay.\n\nThe Government has released [guidance on the\nscheme](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-for-wage-costs-through-the-\ncoronavirus-job-retention-scheme). We still do not have all the details, but\nwe have answered some of the most frequently asked questions below.\n\nThis follows updated guidance released by the Government as at 5th April 2020.\n\nWe are in unprecedented times and the government\u2019s guidance is constantly\nbeing updated so it is therefore crucial that you keep up to date with the\nlatest updates.\n\n  1. What is furlough leave/the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme?\n  2. Can I be furloughed?\n  3. How will my pay be calculated when I am furloughed?\n  4. What if my employment has already ended?\n  5. What category of workers can be furloughed?\n  6. Can I work whilst furloughed?\n  7. What if I can\u2019t be furloughed?\n\n## 1\\. What is furlough leave/the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme?\n\n### 1.1. What is furlough leave/the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme?\n\nA \u2018furloughed employee\u2019 is referred to in the guidance as an employee \u201con a\nleave of absence\u201d. Whilst a \u2018furloughed employee\u2019 is not a recognised term in\nUK employment law, the scheme will allow employers to place their employees on\n\u2018furlough leave\u2019 as an alternative to redundancy. Employers whose operations\nhave be affected by the current crisis will be able to keep employees on their\npayroll and then be able to apply for a grant to recover a proportion of their\nemployees\u2019 wages.\n\nAn employer will only be able to benefit from the scheme in respect of\nemployees which they confirm are \u2018furloughed employees\u2019. To do this they will\nhave to formally notify the employee that they are \u2018furloughed\u2019 and obtain\ntheir agreement. It is important that employers keep a copy of that\ncommunication. Employers may need to advise employees of the potential\nalternatives (e.g. redundancy) otherwise employees may not wish to accept a\nreduction in pay (see below).\n\n **The scheme will be in place for at least 3 months from 1 March 2020.**\n\n### 1.2. Which businesses are eligible?\n\nAny employers in the UK will be eligible for the scheme including charities,\nrecruitment agencies and public authorities provided that they have a PAYE\npayroll scheme in place on or before 28 February 2020 and have a UK bank\naccount.\n\n### 1.3. How will employers claim this grant?\n\nHMRC will establish an online portal through which employers will be able to\nclaim the grant and this is hoped to be available by the end of April 2020.\n\nEmployers will need to provide the following information to HMRC:\n\n  *     * PAYE reference number\n    * the number of employees being furloughed\n    * the claim period (start and end date)\n    * amount claimed (per the minimum length of furloughing of 3 weeks)\n    * bank account number and sort code\n    * contact name\n    * phone number\n\nEmployers will be able to submit a claim every 3 weeks and claims can be back-\ndated to 1 March 2020.\n\n### 1.4. Will furlough leave affect employment rights?\n\nThe government guidance has helpfully confirmed that \u2018furloughed employees\u2019\nwill have the same rights as before including those for SSP, maternity and\nother parental rights, rights against unfair dismissal and for redundancy\npayments.  \nIt is anticipated that employees will have continuous employment throughout\nthe \u2018furloughed\u2019 period as this will be treated as a temporary cessation of\nwork.\n\n### 1.5. What happens after the scheme comes to an end?\n\nThe scheme may be extended further, we will have to wait and see. Once it does\ncome to an end, it is for employers to decide whether employees can return to\ntheir duties or whether it may be necessary to consider redundancies. There is\nno obligation to retain the services of furloughed employees for a period of\ntime after the scheme ends. But notice periods and statutory redundancy rights\nwill continue to apply in the usual way.\n\n## 2\\. Can I be furloughed?\n\n### 2.1. Which employees will be eligible?\n\nThe scheme will potentially cover all staff paid through PAYE who have been on\nthe payroll since 28 February 2020 on any type of contract including full-time\nand part time, agency contracts (so long as they are on PAYE contracts) and\nemployees/workers on flexible or zero hours contracts.\n\n **The minimum period of furlough leave will be three weeks.**\n\nIf employees are working but on reduced hours or for reduced pay then they\nwill not eligible for the scheme.\n\nEmployees who are \u2018shielding\u2019 in line with public health guidance can be\nplaced on \u2018furlough leave\u2019. Employees who are currently on sick leave or are\nself-isolating in line with government advice are entitled to Statutory Sick\nPay (SSP) but once they return to work they can then be \u2018furloughed\u2019.\n\nEmployers must take care to not discriminate when deciding which employees to\nplace on \u2018furlough leave\u2019. However, it is not expected to be discriminatory to\noffer it to employees considered as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 as per government guidance.\nThis is on the basis that offering \u2018furlough leave\u2019 to vulnerable individuals\nin line with the guidance is likely to be acceptable \u2018means of achieving a\nlegitimate aim\u2019.\n\nSelf-employed individuals will be supported by an alternative scheme which we\nhave considered in a separate blog found [here](https://www.hja.net/new-\ngovernment-support-announced-for-the-self-employed/).\n\n### 2.2. Can I choose to be furloughed?\n\nNo, furlough leave is something which must be agreed with your employer. If\nyou are concerned about continuing to work, for example because you or members\nof your household are in a vulnerable group, and you would like to be\nfurloughed, you should discuss your concerns with your employer.\n\nSome businesses are asking for volunteers to furlough, but this is usually\nsubject to the agreement of their managers because furloughed staff cannot\nwork, so this may not suit the business.\n\nIf you are doing the same or a similar job as someone who is furloughed, it is\npossible to rotate on and off furlough leave with them in three week blocks.\nYou should speak to your employer about this.\n\nAlternatively, it may be possible to agree with your employer to work from\nhome or alternatively your employer may agree to allow you to take time off as\nannual leave or unpaid leave.\n\nIf you are disabled for the purposes of the Equality Act 2010, failure to\nallow you to work from/stay at home could amount to a failure to make\nreasonable adjustments and therefore be discriminatory.\n\n### 2.3. Does an employer have to consult with employees before furloughing?\n\nIn most cases it will be necessary to agree with employees that they will be\nfurloughed, because their employment contracts do not give the employer a\nunilateral right to withdraw work/lay-off, plus in most cases pay is being\nreduced. If the alternatives are redundancy or unpaid leave of absence, it is\nvery likely that employees will agree to being furloughed in order to receive\nthe financial protection on offer.\n\nHowever, if employers are identifying individuals for furlough who would\notherwise be made redundant, and so the alternative contemplated by the\nemployer to putting employees on furlough is a redundancy exercise, then this\nwill potentially trigger collective consultation duties. If collective\nconsultation obligations are triggered, the usual time frame for the\nconsultation to take place is unlikely to be viable in the current situation.\nThere is a \"special circumstances\" defence which may allow the process to be\ncondensed (but it cannot be avoided altogether).\n\nIn addition to collective consultation, it is likely that individual\nconsultation will also be required given that a change is being proposed to an\nemployee's current working arrangements (and potentially to their wages). The\nlevel of discussion required will vary depending on the number of employees\nthe business has to talk to and how quickly changes need to be made.\n\nAn employer will need to consider what it will do about those who refuse\nconsent. Would they be at increased risk of redundancy, will the employer\nenforce this pay cut unilaterally and hope that the employees do not claim\nback the shortfall of wages, or will the employer back down?\n\nRecently updated guidance has confirmed that employers must notify employees\nof their furlough status in writing (the previous guidance did not require it\nbe in writing) and keep the record of that written notification for five\nyears.\n\n### 2.4. My employer is refusing to furlough me, whilst other employees have\nbeen furloughed, can I insist on being furloughed?\n\nYou cannot insist on being furloughed. It is up to your employer to decide who\nto place on furlough leave.\n\nIdeally, the employer should consult with staff beforehand.\n\nThe employer is expected to base its decision on the needs of the business.\n\nWhen selecting who to furlough, the employer should ensure it applies fair and\nnon\u2013discriminatory selection criteria.\n\nIf your employer considers there is still work for you to do, it may not want\nto furlough you.\n\n### 2.5. Can an employer place people on furlough leave if they cannot carry\nout their role due to childcare issues, but where there is work for them to\ndo?\n\nEmployers must take care to not discriminate when deciding which employees to\nplace on furlough leave. It is not expected to be discriminatory to offer it\nto employees considered as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 as per government guidance. This is on\nthe basis that offering furlough leave to vulnerable individuals in line with\nthe guidance is likely to be justified for health and safety reasons (it is an\nacceptable means of achieving a legitimate aim).\n\nSelecting people for furlough leave because have young children at home and no\nalternative childcare is, on the face of it, indirect discrimination.\nEmployers will no doubt try to justify it on the basis of a productivity\nargument, but this is going to be difficult if individuals can show that they\ncan manage their responsibilities and still perform their role from home. If\nyour employer is taking this approach, you should raise your concerns and\ndiscuss with your employer whether working from home or flexible working is\npossible instead.\n\nAlternatively you could request to take paid annual leave, or a period of\nunpaid leave (although furlough would likely be preferable to that).\n\n### 2.6. Do employers have to put employees on furlough leave instead of\nmaking redundancies?\n\nIt is currently unclear whether it will be mandatory for employers to put\nemployees on furlough leave instead of making redundancies. However, we would\nadvise that this is discussed as an option prior to any redundancy decisions.\nWhilst employers do not have to accept this, they should be following a fair\nprocedure in making any dismissals and this includes considering any\nalternatives to redundancy. It therefore appears that considering furlough\nleave/the Coronavirus Job Retention scheme would be a reasonable part of the\nprocess.\n\nIf an employer is having cash flow problems during this crisis and cannot be\nreasonably expected to find an employee\u2019s salary before it can be repaid\nthrough the scheme, and/or it seems very likely that a role will no longer be\nrequired longer term, and/or the whole business is shutting down then it may\nbe reasonable to make redundancies instead.\n\nEmployers will need to consider if collective consultation obligations are\ntriggered if they are proposing to enforce furlough by dismissing and re-\nengaging significant numbers of staff on new terms. The government guidance\nmakes it clear that these may be triggered if sufficient numbers of employees\nare involved.\n\n### 2.7. My employer is making me redundant. I have asked to be furloughed and\nhave been told they are not making any applications for the furlough scheme.\nWhat are my options?\n\nEmployees who are under notice of redundancy, or who have been made redundant\nafter 28th February can be put on furlough leave instead but potentially\nredundant employees do not have a right to require their employer to place\nthem on furlough leave as an alternative to redundancy. However, it is hoped\nthat many employers will see the new scheme as preferable to business closure\nand making redundancies, and certainly this is what it is intended for. It is\nalso arguable that refusing to place an employee on furlough leave and making\nthem redundant could amount to an unfair dismissal. You should therefore speak\nto your employer and explain that they have the option to furlough you and at\nlittle extra cost if you agree to a reduction of your salary to 80% (up to a\nmaximum \u00a32,500) meaning your employer could re-coup your costs in full from\nthe government. Your employer would likely want you to also agree that your\nredundancy will still take effect at the end of the furlough scheme period\n(subject to any extension) and that any period of notice would continue to run\nduring this period, and any holiday entitlement will be reduced to the\nstatutory minimum.\n\n### 2.8. Can my employer delay my redundancy and put me on furlough?\n\nYes, but they are not compelled to. Employees who are under notice of\nredundancy, or who have been made redundant after 28th February can be put on\nfurlough leave instead but potentially redundant employees do not have a right\nto require their employer to place them on furlough leave as an alternative to\nredundancy. However, it is hoped that many employers will see the new scheme\nas preferable to business closure and making redundancies, and certainly this\nis what it is intended for.\n\n### 2.9. I have tried to get my employer to agree to furlough me because I\nthink I am eligible, but they aren\u2019t listening to me. What should I do?\n\nThere is no obligation on your employer to put you on furlough leave, and the\nmost common reason not to furlough is because your employer still needs you to\ndo your job. However, where the alternative is redundancy or business closure\nit is hoped that many employers will use the new scheme, and certainly this is\nwhat it is intended for. You should point to the relevant part of the\ngovernment guidance which supports your case that you are eligible, and help\nyour employer understand that you can be furloughed at no cost to them (if you\nagree to a reduction of your salary to 80% (up to a maximum \u00a32,500). If short\nterm cash flow is an issue, you can even agree to defer being paid until you\nhave been accepted on to the scheme and your employer has received the money\nfrom the government. You can also consider speaking to colleagues who may be\nin a similar position and approach your employer collectively. You may enlist\nthe help of a union or a lawyer to argue your case for you.\n\n## 3.How will my pay be calculated when I am furloughed?\n\n### 3.1 What will HMRC reimburse?\n\nEmployers will be able to claim 80% of a furloughed employee\u2019s salary up to a\ncap of \u00a32,500 per month _plus_ the employer\u2019s National Insurance contributions\nand minimum auto-enrolment employer pension contributions.\n\nFor salaried employees, the wages which can be claimed will be based on their\nnormal salary.\n\nThe Government has recently updated the guidance to say that an employer can\nreclaim any regular payments it is obliged to pay its employees as well as\nbasic salary (subject to the overall cap of \u00a32,500 per person). This includes\nwages, past overtime, fees and compulsory commission payments. Compulsory\npresumably means contractual. It can only be referring to the commission from\npast sales as the furloughed employees cannot be completing new sales when on\nfurlough.\n\nDiscretionary bonus (including tips) and commission payments and non-cash\npayments should be excluded.\n\nThe 80% also does not include non-monetary benefits (e.g. the value of health\ninsurance or a car). Benefits provided through salary sacrifice schemes\n(including pension contributions) that reduce an employee\u2019s taxable pay should\nalso not be included in the reference salary.\n\nFor employees whose pay varies, e.g. those on zero hour contracts, the wages\nwhich can be claimed will be based on the higher of their equivalent pay in\nthe same month in the previous year or their average monthly pay over the\n2018/19 tax year, whichever is higher.\n\nIf the employee has been employed for less than a year, the employer can claim\nfor an average of their monthly earnings since they started work.\n\n### 3.2. Are employers required to \u2018top up\u2019 the additional 20% of their\nemployee\u2019s wages (or pay the extra salary for staff earning over \u00a33,125 per\nmonth)?\n\nNo they are not required to do so however some may wish to. However this is\nwhy it is important to obtain employee agreement to furlough where pay is\nbeing reduced.\n\n### 3.3. Does a furlough payment take into account my overtime pay or is it\njust basic salary?\n\nUnder the Scheme employers can claim up to the lower of 80% of usual monthly\nwage costs or \u00a32,500 per employee, plus the associated employer national\ninsurance contributions and minimum auto-enrolment employer pension\ncontributions.\n\nThe 80% calculation is based on the employee's gross salary at 28 February\n2020, but the Government has recently updated the guidance to say that an\nemployer can reclaim any regular payments it is obliged to pay its employees\n(subject to the overall cap of \u00a32,500 per person). This includes wages, past\novertime, fees and compulsory commission payments. Compulsory presumably means\ncontractual/guaranteed over-time.\n\nEmployees who regularly earn overtime are likely to argue that this gives rise\nto an obligation to pay over-time as part of their normal wage.\n\n### 3.4. Is furlough pay based on hours normally worked (e.g. 60 hours) or on\ncontracted hours (e.g. 40 hours)?\n\nIf you are furloughed, your employer will be able to claim the reimbursement\nfor your wages based on 80% of your usual monthly wage cost before tax, as of\n28 February or \u00a32,500, whichever is the lower sum.  \nAs such, your furloughed pay will be based on actual hours worked and your\nusual monthly pay.\n\n### 3.5. What if my monthly pay varies?\n\nIn this case, your furloughed pay will depend on how long you\u2019ve been employed\nand when you commenced work.\n\nIf you have been employed for less than one year, the reimbursement will be\nbased on an average of your monthly earnings since you started work.\n\nIf you have been employed for more than one year, the reimbursement can be\nclaimed on the basis of the higher of either:\n\n **a**. the same month\u2019s earnings from the previous year; or  \n**b**. average monthly earnings from the 2019-2020 tax year (i.e. 6 April 2019\nto 5 April 2020);\n\nIf you only started work in February 2020, the reimbursement will be based on\nyour pro-rata earnings so far.\n\n### 3.6. Does my employer have to continue to pay me and then claim a furlough\npayment back from the government or do they only have to pay me once they\nreceive the money?\n\nAssuming your employer does not have the contractual right to reduce/defer\nyour pay (which is rare), your employer has to continue to pay you as normal,\nunless you expressly agree otherwise. If short term cash flow is an issue, you\ncan agree to defer being paid until you have been accepted on to the scheme\nand your employer has received the money from the government, but this may be\ndifficult for you as there is still some uncertainty about when the scheme\nwill start paying out.\n\n## 4\\. What if my employment has already ended?\n\n### 4.1. Can employees who have already been made redundant be re-hired and\nput on furlough leave?\n\nStaff must have been on the payroll on 28 February 2020 but are still eligible\nif they were made redundant after that date but have been rehired. Businesses\nwhich have already made redundancies or commenced redundancy consultation\n(particularly collective redundancy consultation) will need to consider\nwhether and how the availability of this scheme will alter their plans and the\nimpact on any appeals against dismissals.\n\n### 4.2. I left my old employer on 27 February. I was due to start with my new\nemployer at the beginning of April. Can I be furloughed?\n\nUnfortunately, you cannot be furloughed by your former employer if you were\nnot on their payroll at 28 February 2020. For the same reason, your new\nemployer cannot furlough you as the scheme only applies to those who were on\nits payroll at 28 February.\n\n### 4.3. I left my old employer on 2 February and I joined my current employer\non 8 March. Can I be furloughed?\n\nMaybe. The key date is 28 February 2020. If you were on your new employer\u2019s\nPAYE payroll on that date, you can be furloughed by your new employer. If you\nwere not on their payroll on 28 February you cannot be furloughed.\n\n### 4.4. I am working my notice but my new employer is now unable to employ\nme, can my present employer put me on furlough?\n\nIf you were still under notice (and your employment was still continuing) on\n28th February, then yes, your current employer can furlough you. However, the\ndecision is your employer\u2019s.\n\nIf your employment was due to end because of redundancy you are eligible under\nthe scheme. Your employer will need to reinstate you first.\n\nUnder the scheme, it appears that if you resigned voluntarily you will also be\neligible. In such a scenario, you should retract your resignation.\n\n### 4.5. I resigned from my job in March this year, can I ask my former\nemployer to furlough me?\n\nIf you were on your former employer\u2019s payroll on 28 February 2020, you could\nstill be eligible to be furloughed even if you resigned voluntarily.  \nYou will have to persuade your former employer to reinstate you and then place\nyou on furlough.\n\n### 4.6. I am currently not working but was due to start a new job this month,\nbut it has been withdrawn. What are my rights?\n\nIf you had entered into a contract with your new employer you may be entitled\nto some payment under the terms of that contract (notice pay for example).\nYour rights will depends on the terms of your contract, you should seek\nfurther advice on this.  \nYou will not be eligible under the furloughing scheme if you were not included\nin any PAYE payroll scheme at the key date, which is 28 February 2020.\n\nYou will be eligible for assistance under the welfare system, including\nUniversal Credit.\n\n **For further information please\ncheck[here](https://www.understandinguniversalcredit.gov.uk/coronavirus/).**\n\n### 4.7. My employer has asked me to sign a furlough agreement but they are\nusing it to change other contractual elements, for example that after furlough\nfinishes I will agree to a 20% pay cut. Can they do that?\n\nYour employer should not be using your agreement to furlough as an opportunity\nto vary your other terms, particularly when it comes to matters as fundamental\nas your pay.\n\nThe starting point it to check whether the terms of your contact allow your\nemployer to vary your terms and conditions. Even if such a clause exists, the\nemployer should exercise caution when seeking to impose changes, as such a\nclause does not give your employer carte blanche to make changes to the\ncontract.\n\nLegally, an employer cannot impose a pay cut on you without your express\nconsent. Any consent obtained under duress (that you accept the reduction or\nface redundancy/dismissal) will be open to challenge.\n\n## 5\\. What category of workers can be furloughed?\n\n### 5.1. I am a temporary worker/bank staff. Am I eligible for furlough leave?\n\nYes, if you were on the employer\u2019s PAYE payroll on 28 February 2020.\n\nIf you are not paid through PAYE, if you pay tax on your trading profits\nthrough Income Tax Self-Assessment, you may instead be eligible for the Self-\nEmployed Income Support Scheme (SEISS). Please refer to our FAQs relating to\nthis scheme.\n\n### 5.2. I am an agency worker, am I entitled to furlough leave?\n\nAgency workers on PAYE payroll can be furloughed by the agency, so long as\nthey are not doing any work.\n\n### 5.3. Are employees on fixed term contracts which are due to finish\neligible for furlough leave?\n\nEmployees on fixed term contracts can be furloughed. Their contracts can be\nrenewed or extended during the furlough period without breaking the terms of\nthe scheme. Where a fixed term employee\u2019s contract ends because it is not\nextended or renewed you will no longer be able claim grant for them.\n\n### 5.4. I\u2019m an executive director, can I be furloughed?\n\nCompany directors who are also employees can be furloughed (so long as they\nare on the company\u2019s PAYE as at 28th February 2020). They can still perform\ntheir statutory duties, but not other work for the company.\n\nThis also applies to salaried individuals who are directors of their own\npersonal service company (PSC).\n\n## 6\\. Can I work whilst furloughed?\n\n### 6.1. Can employees continue to work while furloughed?\n\nNo, employees should not carry out any work for their employer during this\ntime. Employees can undertake volunteer work or training, but only so long as\nit does not entail providing services to or generating revenue for their\nemployer i.e. what is envisaged here is that employees can volunteer, for\nexample as an NHS volunteer or for a charity whilst on furlough. If staff are\nrequired to undertake training during furlough leave, they are entitled to be\npaid at least the applicable minimum wage rate for doing so, even if this\nexceeds the 80% which will be reimbursed by HMRC.\n\n### 6.2. My employer is backdating my furlough leave to 1st March, despite me\nworking full time all month. Furthermore, he has also made it clear that I am\nexpected to continue working during my furlough leave, when I know I shouldn\u2019t\nbe under the rules of the scheme. What should I do?\n\nThe furlough scheme is essentially a grant from the government to employers to\ncover 80% of a furloughed employee\u2019s wages. It is a clear condition of the\nscheme that furloughed employees cannot undertake work. They can however take\npart in volunteer work or any training provided that it does not provide\nservices to generate revenue for their employer.\n\nYou should raise this with your employer. If this falls on deaf ears,\nultimately it is your employer\u2019s risk because HMRC has said that they will\naudit the operation of the scheme retrospectively so if they discover that you\nhave continued to work they may try to recoup the grant from your employer.\nYou should still have received your pay from your employer.\n\n### 6.3. I had booked annual leave but have now been furloughed. Can I cancel\nit and take it later in the year?\n\nYes, subject to any specific notice requirement in your contract/any\napplicable policy. The government is changing the regulations on holiday so\nthat employees are permitted to carry-over up to 4 weeks\u2019 leave where it was\nnot reasonably practicable to take it in the leave year \"as a result of the\neffects of the coronavirus\u201d.\n\nHowever, the interaction between annual leave and furlough leave is not\ncurrently clear.\n\nMany employers are taking the position of not allowing furloughed employees to\ntake holiday in case holiday pay is not recoverable in full under the scheme\nor, worse, that the annual leave has broken the period of furlough leave such\nthat the furlough pay is not recoverable either.\n\n### 6.4.. I\u2019ve been furloughed. Can I work elsewhere to top up my income?\n\nEmployees can start a new job when on furlough (meaning they might end up\nearning 80% of the old salary and 100% of a new one). This was not prohibited\nin the earlier guidance, but the new guidance expressly allows it. The\nguidance does say it has to be allowed under your employment contract,\ntherefore check what your contract says because some contracts will contain\nrestrictions on working elsewhere during employment. If so, you could speak to\nyour employer and try to get their agreement to relax those restrictions\ntemporarily. It is, however, clear that you cannot do work for your employer\nseeking the reimbursement during furlough.\n\nAlso note that the government guidance for employees states that an employee\ncan be furloughed by one employer and continue to work for the other, or can\nbe furloughed by both employers.

What is Full Cycle Recruiting?\n\nFull cycle recruiting is defined as the holistic recruitment process that\nholds under its purview the 6 key stages of the recruitment cycle \u2013analyzing\ntalent gaps, sourcing, screening, selecting, hiring and onboarding. Full cycle\nrecruiting is also referred to as life cycle recruiting, full circle\nrecruiting and 360\u00ba recruitment cycle. An HR professional who performs every\nstep of the total recruiting cycle is called a full cycle recruiter.\n\nWhile small and mid-size businesses (SMBs) usually have just one individual\nhandling every aspect of the recruitment life cycle, organizations with a\nlarger employee base, often have a whole department with different individuals\nor teams looking into certain aspects or stages of the full recruitment cycle.\n\nAn employee\u2019s experience in the organization begins as a candidate through the\njourney of full cycle recruitment. With organizations vying for the best\ntalent in an environment of continuous connection and digital competition,\nfine-tuning every phase of the full cycle recruitment becomes an immediate\nrequirement.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is Candidate Management? Definition, Relationship\nManagement, and Best\nPractices](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-management-definition-best-practices/)**\n\n## 2\\. Full Cycle Recruiting: Process and Stages\n\nAs we discussed earlier, the process of full cycle recruitment begins with\nfinding a talent gap within the system and ends with filling that gap\neffectively. This process of filling the talent gap spans over six key phases\nas enumerated in the diagram below.\n\n![Full Cycle Recruiting: Process and Stages](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### A. Identifying the Talent Gap\n\n  \nThe cycle of effective talent acquisition, management and retention begin with\nidentifying talent gaps effectively \u2013 not only for immediate needs but also\nfor strategic talent planning for the future. This involves creating a\ndetailed job description based on the strategic business needs of the\norganization. Whether the talent gap is a result of the departure of an\nexistent talent (in which case the role already exists) or of a new position\nbeing created in accordance with the organization\u2019s growth and expansion\nplans, there should be a clear map to identify the skills, qualifications, and\nexperience in the talent pool.\n\nWith predictive data tools that help you identify not only employees who might\nbe considering leaving but also provide you insight into future skills to\nscour for, the smart recruiter can spot skill and talent gaps more\neffectively. The idea is not merely to spot the missing space in the puzzle\nbut also to lay out the needed characteristics of the missing piece.\n**[Effective workforce\nplanning](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/how-analytics-can-\nimprove-workforce-planning-in-2019/)** is the key to always having the right\ntalent onboard irrespective of the volatility in the external environment.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is Talent Management? Definition, Strategy, Process\nand Model](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/)**\n\n### B. Sourcing\n\n  \nRecruiters today operate in a candidate-driven market that is global, wide and\nexpansive. Having access to the right talent pool in this sea of possibilities\ncomes with challenges. Sourcing thus involves tapping into the right talent\npool and identifying both active and passive candidates. As a recruiter, the\ntalent pool that you have access to colors and contextualizes your vision of\nthe ideal candidate. The debate boils down to two choices \u2013 whether to widen\nthe sourcing view or to narrow it down and focus better on the key\ncharacteristics of the required talent.\n\nRecruiters have access to candidate information not only on job portals but\nalso on social networking platforms. This allows the recruiter to formulate a\nholistic picture of candidates. Solutions by Fetcher or Arya not only provide\nAI-enabled sourcing features but also better candidate engagement. Moreover,\nthe present-day recruiter needs to be able to engage with talent on platforms\nthey wish to be engaged on and the sourcing phase of full cycle recruitment\nalso needs to adapt to the changing candidate expectations. How you reach out\nto candidates can make or break the perception of your employer brand.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is Talent Sourcing? Definition, Process, Strategy with\nExamples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-\nis-talent-sourcing/)**\n\n### C. Screening\n\n  \nHaving access to a wide pool of talent to source from, we need screening\nstrategies that are fluid, relevant and effective. A bigger sourcing pool\nshould not act as a hindrance to finding the right candidate but should rather\nbe leveraged to arrive at the best person-organization fit. **[AI-enabled\nscreening tools](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/background-\nverification/4-essentials-of-an-ai-powered-candidate-screening-software/)**\nmake it possible to skim through large talent pools.\n\nEffective steps to screening better involve understanding the time frame and\nurgency of filling the talent gap, carrying out an in-depth skill and profile\nmatch and gauging the candidate\u2019s motivation for the role and the path ahead.\nTools like Avrio help in qualifying hard skills as well as the fit of the\ncandidate. Conversational AI like **[recruiting\nchatbots](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/3-ways-ai-chatbots-can-redefine-the-employee-experience/)** can\nengage with multiple candidates while humanizing the process and can help\nprovide a wealth of data by allowing recruiters to look beyond the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and\nbeneath the projected \u201cinterview personality\u201d.\n\nThis phase depends heavily on the first phase of analyzing the talent gap.\nYour screening checklist depends on how detailed your analysis has been of the\nskills and personality traits needed. By the end of this phase, you should\nhave a shortlist of candidates who fit the requirement the best. Screening,\nthough time-consuming (although AI tools have decreased the time needed\nexponentially), is an important part of the funneling process since it\nprovides you with the best candidates to invest your time and energy on.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Candidate Screening and Selection Process: The Complete\nGuide for 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-screening-and-selection/)**\n\n### D. Selecting\n\n  \nSelecting involves evaluating shortlisted candidates post-screening. Tools\nthat aid selection range from skills tests, gamified assessments and\npersonality questionnaires to interviews with hiring managers, supervisors and\nteam leaders. AI tools like Scribe and Otter can help with the transcription\nof interviews, which can then be qualified with keyword-driven algorithms.\nWith artificial intelligence segueing into the recruitment space, human\nrecruiters can conserve their energy and focus on strategic selection.\n\nThe idea is not just to find the candidate who ticks off all the skills\nrequirements but to also find the right per-organization fit \u2013 a candidate who\nfits into all aspects of the role has the right personality traits and is in\nsynch with the values and vision of the organization. Having an objective, the\neffective selection process involves having unbiased tools in place that allow\nrecruiters to gauge the possibilities that each shortlisted candidate comes\nwith.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is recruitment? Definition, process, techniques and\nmethods with examples for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-\nrecruitment/)**\n\n### E. Hiring\n\n  \nNow, at the end of the funneling process of the full recruiting cycle, you are\nleft with your final candidate choice. This phase involves negotiating a\ncontract that makes sense for business and is also relevant for the candidate.\nCompensation surveying and benchmarking tools help in understanding how to\nposition your offer. A career development plan also needs to be in place for\nthe candidate to want to grow into. Finding the right balance between the\nneeds and demands of the candidate and those of the organization is the key to\nclosing the right hire.\n\nIt is also important to know which r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to hold onto from the rejected\ncandidates and to understand the scope and time frame of future roles that\nthey may be suitable for. Your dealings with the rejected candidates and those\nwho choose to drop off the process and even how you handle background checks\naffect your employer brand and the image you wish to uphold in front of the\nlarger talent pool.\n\n**Learn More:** **[How to Become a Smart Recruitment Specialist in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-to-\nbecome-a-smart-recruitment-specialist/)**\n\n### F. Onboarding\n\n  \nGetting the right talent onboard involves making your new employee feel\nwelcome into the role and in the organization. This is the first interaction\nyour chosen candidate has with the rest of the organization as an employee and\nit needs to be planned and glitch-free. Employees want to walk into an\norganization that is prepared for them be it with having a system and\ndesignated workspace all set for them or enabling their adaptation to a new\nwork environment.\n\nConversational bots like Slack that effectively engage with new employees\nwhile giving them an e-tour of processes and organizational frameworks are\nhelpful indeed. That said, having a human face to deal with on the first day\nimproves the employee experience and builds an emotional connect that is\ndifficult to enable with technology alone.\n\n**Learn More:[What Is Onboarding?

Best Practices for Full Cycle Recruiting\n\nWhile the larger process framework of full cycle recruitment has not altered\nmuch over the years, the facets that build up the process, the environment in\nwhich the process needs to be applied and the audience that the process needs\nto engage have all undergone change. The smart full cycle recruiter needs to\nbe abreast with best practices that will help them to tweak the cycle where\nnecessary and make the most of technology trends and offerings. The image\nbelow sums up the key best practices that the smart full cycle recruiter needs\nto keep in mind.\n\n![Best Practices for Full Cycle Recruiting](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**A. Read the market right:** In a market that is candidate-driven and\nexperience focused, your recruitment cycle needs to provide a candidate\njourney that your target candidate audience finds attractive enough to invest\nin. You need to be able to negotiate a deal that makes business-sense in a\nmarket that allows the best candidates to be demanding. The newer generations\nat work value transparent and honest employer brands and keeping that in mind\nin the sourcing and screening phases helps you connect with your audience\nbetter.\n\n**B.** **Human-AI collaboration:** As a smart full cycle recruiter, you need\nto keep in mind that the future is collaborative. You need to tweak every\naspect of your recruitment cycle to make the most of human-AI interventions.\nYou need to use the best of both worlds to strategize your recruitment\nprocess.

It\u2019s a process that you invest in and win with every day.\nLikewise with the recruitment cycle. Your journey doesn\u2019t stop with getting\nthe right talent onboard. Agile strategies need to be in place to help the\norganization adapt to our fluid and dynamic environment. Organizations thus\nneed to be ready with a predictive and proactive talent planning and mapping\ntool that can be deployed on demand.\n\nOrganizations not only need to rethink and realign their full cycle recruiting\nplan in the context of the talent-scape that they operate in today, but also\nbe ready to evolve faster and ride the talent trends that are coming our way\ntomorrow. We need to bear in mind the fact that the evolution timeline in the\nworld of work is skewed. Changes that took a decade, now take less than a\nyear. With disruptive evolution, changes take place in leaps.

It is\nprimarily an extension of a human resources department for your business. If\nyou outsource to a skilled provider, there are plenty of benefits you can get.\nIt\u2019s a great way to get the most out of recruitment tasks that your own human\nresources team may not have the time for, or the capability to tackle. These\ntasks can include:\n\n  1. Creating a recruitment strategy\n  2. Providing consultation\n  3. Selecting and managing all necessary technology and processes\n  4. Sourcing, screening, and shortlisting candidates\n  5. Conducting interviews, tests, and assessments\n  6. Onboarding\n\n  \nHere\u2019s an example of how this might work: an RPO provider can have a dedicated\nteam screen applicants based on resumes, social media sites, professional\nnetworking sites, and job platforms.1 They can also hunt for potential\ncandidates who have not applied, using the same online sources. The team will\nthen build up a database filled with pre-screened potentials, ready to be\ncherry-picked for job interviews.\n\nWith each generation, RPO technology advances. Tools such as scheduling bots,\nautomated recruitment marketing, CRM platforms, and smart analytics for job\nadvertisements are quite common, and AI integration into the recruitment\nprocess is growing in popularity.\n\nRPO company Allegis,2 for example, combines their sourcing service with the\nAGS Intellect system. This system can automate **[talent\npipelines](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-pipeline/)** , and it uses conversational AI tools\nto automate part of the hiring experience as well.\n\nMany providers will regularly conduct surveys and other research to keep\nconnected to the demands and expectations in various industries and\ngenerations. Engage2Excel3 updates its sourcing strategies according to its\nnew findings on what is valued by specific talent profiles.\n\nAs some industries might need a hyper-specialized approach, there are\nproviders whose expertise is narrowly focused. AMN Healthcare4 offers help on\n**[talent acquisition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-acquisition/)** just within the healthcare industry,\nas the demand is substantial: 7.2 million workers short and rising, according\nto other healthcare RPO leader Cielo.5\n\n### **How RPO started**\n\n  \nRecruitment process outsourcing was first founded about ten years ago. In the\nbeginning, there were two types of providers: those who did high-volume, low-\ncomplexity work, and those who tackled the opposite: a highly specialized\nsniper approach.\n\nMany HR managers hesitated when it came to outsourcing their recruitment and\nwere slower to adapt. Still, the boom and bust of the early 2000s and the\nrapid expansion of tools and technology meant that RPO became popular as the\ngrowth of other outsourced business models began to take hold.\n\nNowadays, executives are more comfortable with outsourcing recruitment, so\nthat the company can focus on revenue. Most providers tackle a variety of\nhigh- and low-complexity and volume work, and they are less likely to\nspecialize.\n\nToday\u2019s RPO has many benefits for your business, which we have outlined here.\n\n**Learn More:**\n\n## **What Are the Benefits of Recruitment Process Outsourcing?**\n\nThere are many upsides to using an RPO service. These come down to saving you\ntime, money, and resources and allowing your talented HR staff to use their\nown strengths more effectively. But let\u2019s look at a more detailed overview of\nthe pros of recruitment process outsourcing.\n\n### **1\\. A stronger quality of hire**\n\n  \nObviously, the easiest place to see the positive side of outsourcing your\nrecruitment is in the strength of your hires. A good RPO provider can draw\nfrom their own pool of talent, as well as spending time, money, and resources\nchasing down leads and handling targeting advertising.\n\nThey can also help you streamline your hiring process and help you clarify\nwhat you need in a hire. That means you and your company get a wider selection\nof talent with less effort, and you can focus on the bottom line knowing that\nrecruitment is in good hands.\n\n### **2\\. Saves you time**  \n\nRPO providers have structures and plans that can adapt to a variety of\nsituations \u2013 even those providers who experience regular peaks and lows in\ntheir hiring process. They can help you create a plan that will get to your\nnew hires quickly and efficiently, with all the paperwork and procedures\ncarefully followed.\n\n### **3\\. Simplifies your hiring process with compliance regulations and\nanalytics reporting**  \n\nRPO helps you streamline your hiring process with data-driven recruiting. RPOs\nare experts on tracking and tracing every stage of the recruitment process.\nThey\u2019re also experts on trade, labor laws, and standards. A high-quality RPO\nservice keeps careful records of every step of your recruitment process,\nproviding fully audible processes and methods that are easy to map and\nrecreate as needed.\n\n### **4\\. Saves you money**\n\n  \nOutsourcing recruitment is good news for your bottom line. Time is money, and\nso is traditional advertising. The time your in-house HR department spends on\ntargeting and recruiting, as well as filing agreements and drawing up\ncontracts, can all be better spent in employee experience strategy, among\nother strategic initiatives.\n\nRPO services fill gaps in your employment faster using modern recruiting\nmethods, which is another way that outsourcing saves you money in the long\nrun. This also helps increase overall productivity. And you\u2019ll likely get a\nhigher-quality hire, leading to less recidivism, and more profit overall.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Top 10 Recruitment Software and Tools for\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nrecruitment-software-technology/)\n\n## **What You Should Know When Considering Recruitment Process Outsourcing**\n\nThough there are obvious upsides to outsourcing, there are some downsides too.\nAnd an RPO provider isn\u2019t right for all businesses or all cases. If you\u2019re\nlooking into an RPO solution to your recruitment, you\u2019ll want to ask yourself,\nand the RPO service providers, the following questions:\n\n### **1\\. Why do you need help recruiting?**\n\n  \nThere are different reasons a company might choose to outsource its\nrecruitment.\n\nIt may be that you\u2019re experiencing a period of growth, and your current\ninternal resources are already overtaxed. It may be that you're planning for\ngrowth or a merger in the future, and you know there will be an increase in\nhiring activity. Or it could simply be that you or your management team are\ndissatisfied with the pool of talent they've gotten through more traditional\nmeans.\n\nWork out exactly why you need help with your recruiting, and you will lead\neasily into the next important question.\n\n### **2\\. What kind of service will you be looking for?**\n\n  \nTypically, RPOs provide three levels of service: project outsourcing, program\noutsourcing, and total outsourcing.\n\n  * Project outsourcing is for hiring a few new people, because your business is expanding, or you\u2019ve hit a busy season.\n  * Program outsourcing means you\u2019re looking to hire over 100 people to tackle a new contract or release a new product line \u2013 that\u2019s a project outsource.\n  * Total outsourcing works if you\u2019re looking to supplement or replace your entire HR department.\n\n  \nBy clearly identifying your needs, you\u2019ll be better positioned when it comes\ntime to choose a provider.\n\nBe mindful \u2013 there are some problems outside recruiters cannot solve. For\ninstance, RPO providers cannot define your business strategy. You need to have\nclear business goals to align your recruiting goals with, and it is beyond\ntheir responsibility to do that for you.\n\nAnother issue is not investing time and money into a change management\nstrategy. You cannot expect an outsider to solve any resistance within your\norganization towards outsourcing the talent hiring process. You need to have\nestablished a sufficient level of acceptance among stakeholders before\ncontracting an RPO partner.\n\nBe sure to allocate the needed resources to help your RPO do the work you\u2019ve\nhired it for.  \n  \nIf your company doesn\u2019t have the existing infrastructure in place, or your\ncurrent systems are inefficient, you may find you need to spend more to get\nthe help you need. But the clearer you can be before choosing an RPO provider,\nthe better it is for your business, your HR department, and your bottom line.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Talent Acquisition vs. Recruitment: Key Differences and\nSimilarities**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-vs-recruitment/)\n\n## **How to Select an RPO Provider**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve decided that you need RPO services and what you need them for,\nit\u2019s time to choose. When you\u2019re looking into hiring a recruiting company,\nconsider the following:\n\n### **1\\. Size of the RPO firm**  \n\nChoosing a small RPO company may save you money, as such companies are\ngenerally regionally based. They tend to focus on a few specialties. If you\u2019re\nlooking for a totally outsourced, long-term solution, you may want to choose a\nlarge provider.\n\n### **2\\. Service structure and level of commitment**\n\n  \nRPO providers differ greatly in terms of technology, processes, and staff. You\nwant to find a provider who will work with you, whether that means helping you\nto refine your current processes or helping you to establish and implement new\nprocesses long term.\n\nConsider what your needs are and be upfront about the commitment you need from\nyour providers. Plan for an adjustment period, as this is needed with all\noutsourced providers.\n\n### **3\\. Cost**\n\n  \nAs well as being honest about your time, you need to allocate sufficient\nresources for what you're trying to accomplish. If your recruiting needs are\nmore temporary, such as project outsourcing, you might feel it's not worth it\nto spend more upfront than you would for traditional HR recruitment plans. But\nif you\u2019re establishing what will be a long-term solution, you may want to\nspend more money on infrastructure initially, to ensure you\u2019re getting\neverything you can out of your RPO as you move forward.\n\n### **4\\. Check reviews and transparency**\n\n  \nAs with all outsourcing, it can be tough to let go of certain aspects of your\nbusiness. Don\u2019t let the promise of time and money that outsourcing offers\nblind you to the potential pitfalls. Check reviews online. Ask for referrals\nfrom co-workers and others in your business. Read through the company\u2019s\nwebsite to see if their work process is clearly laid out, and ask if you will\nhave access to live project documents so you can follow the process at all\ntimes.\n\n## **Key Takeaways**\n\nThough many companies hesitate at the idea of outsourcing, the right RPO\nprovider can help you get an advantage over the competition. Improving your\ntalent acquisition processes improves your business and your bottom line and\nkeeps everyone in the company happy and productive. But it's not a one-size-\nfits-all solution or a quick and easy fix to managing your organizational\n\"mess.\u201d\n\nIf anything, a good RPO provider will lay bare the real cost of your current\nrecruiting, which can be a painful, slow process. However, once that is over\nwith, you will end up with a smooth, informed recruitment process - a process\nthat delivers an abundance of high-quality candidates, optimal candidate\nsatisfaction, and a strong employer brand.\n\n1[Surehand](https://surehand.com)\n\n2[Allegis](https://www.allegisglobalsolutions.com/)\n\n3[How We're Different](https://www.engage2excel.com/recruitment-how-were-\ndifferent/), Engage2Excel.com\n\n4[AMN ](https://www.amnhealthcare.com/)Healthcare\n\n5[10 Myths About Healthcare RPO\nPartnerships](https://www.cielotalent.com/insights/dispelling-10-myths-about-\nhealthcare-rpo-partnerships/), Cielo.com\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhat-is-recruitment-process-outsourcing-rpo-definition-benefits-\nand-\ncompanies%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=What+Is+Recruitment+Process+Outsourcing+%28RPO%29%3F+Definition%2C+Benefits%2C+and+Companies\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What+Is+Recruitment+Process+Outsourcing+%28RPO%29%3F+Definition%2C+Benefits%2C+and+Companies&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhat-is-recruitment-process-outsourcing-rpo-definition-benefits-\nand-\ncompanies%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhat-is-recruitment-process-outsourcing-rpo-definition-benefits-\nand-\ncompanies%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhat-is-recruitment-process-outsourcing-rpo-definition-benefits-\nand-\ncompanies%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=What Is Recruitment Process Outsourcing\n\\(RPO\\)?

As a result, recruitment has had to give way to\nrecruitment 2.0 \u2013 smart recruitment. And this has created the need for all\nrecruiters to now become smart recruitment specialists. What does this job\nentail? Here\u2019s a guide._**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nTechnology has now become an indispensable piece in the people puzzle.\nWorkforce planning \u2013 fueled by business requirements \u2013utilizes big data in HR,\npredictive analysis, and modeling technology to take sound data-driven\ndecisions on organizations\u2019 short- and long-term recruitment needs. Moreover,\nit also underlines the return on investment (ROI) for recruitment.\n\nIn onboarding and retention, the use of standalone or integrated (with\napplicant tracking systems/[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/) software) onboarding\ntechnology helps in maximizing speed and productivity. This not only aids in\ndriving employee engagement but also strengthens retention, resulting in\nreduced risk and greater ROI. While these implications and implementations of\ntechnology need to be kept in mind by any smart HR professional, for the smart\nrecruiter, tools like **[applicant tracking system\n(ATS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\napplicant-tracking-systems/)** have more direct applications since they drive\nefficiency, economy, and scale throughout the recruitment process.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Top 10 Employee Onboarding Software for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nemployee-onboarding-software/)**\n\nToday, recruiters have access to a global talent pool and can engage\ncandidates better. Smarter recruitment strategies have positively impacted the\ncost to hire, time to hire, and the quality of hires and demand a shift in\nfocus and a drive-in impetus. With the need for smarter strategies increasing,\nevery recruitment specialist needs to become a smart recruitment specialist to\ndrive innovation, growth and a strong employer brand.\n\n## **What Is Smart Recruitment?**\n\nSmart recruitment is an updated, upgraded version of recruitment. For example,\nthe basic processes of talent gap analysis,\n**[sourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-talent-sourcing/)** , screening, selection, and\n**[onboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/employee-onboarding-checklist/) **are still as relevant today as\nthey were half a century back. However, the inner workings of these stages\nhave changed considerably.\n\nFrom recruiting chatbots to **[candidate\nscreening](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-screening-and-selection/)** software and\nartificially intelligent (AI) work-buddies to onboard candidates and elevate\nthe **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)** ,\ntechnology tools have revamped how recruitment works.\n\nSmart recruitment is more suited to our present times and better prepared to\nhandle the talent-based demands of the future. This definition points toward a\npressing need for change \u2013 to do away with practices and structures that no\nlonger serve their intended purpose.\n\nWe live in a world that is \u201csmart\u201d and enabled by AI. Recruitment processes\nneed to be able to mimic this environment we have gotten so acclimatized to.\nThat is where smart recruitment comes into the picture.\n\n**Learn More:[Top 10 Employee Recruitment Strategies for 2019 to Hire the Best\nTalent](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/top-\nten-employee-recruitment-strategies/)**\n\n## **Who Is a Smart Recruitment Specialist?**\n\nAs we mentioned in our definition above, a smart recruitment specialist is a\nprofessional with validated expertise in the systems, processes, techniques,\nand strategies of smart recruitment. This expert could either be an in-house\nresource or could contribute in the capacity of a consultant.\n\nA smart recruitment specialist is a catalyst who can help the organization\nadapt to evolving patterns and strategies of recruitment to hire smarter,\nretain stronger, and optimize better. This person must be an expert who is not\nsimply well-versed and in tune with the latest **[recruitment\ntechnologies](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/do-you-use-these-recruitment-technologies-hiring/)** but is also a\nchange agent and a passionate driver of evolution, keeping business goals and\ngrowth plans in mind.\n\nA smart recruiting specialist must be a futurist with a vision for building\nsmarter talent systems within the **[people\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-people-management/)** processes at work.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is Recruitment? Definition, process, techniques and\nmethods with examples for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-\nrecruitment/)**\n\n## **3 Key Considerations to Become a Smart Recruitment Specialist**\n\nAs it is with any endeavor toward expertise and specialization, there is no\ntried and tested recipe to become a smart recruiter. This is more so because\nthe definition of \u201csmart\u201d is continuously evolving with the latest upgrades in\ntechnology. That said, however, there are a few definite points to keep in\nmind while on the journey towards becoming a smarter specialist in recruitment\nfor 2020 and beyond.\n\nThree key points to keep in mind on the path to becoming a smart recruitment\nspecialist for the path forward:\n\n### **1\\. Candidate experience is key**\n\n  \nA smart recruitment specialist must keep in mind the importance of candidate\nexperience. Every interaction that you have with an individual during the\ncandidate journey will be remembered. The tonality used and the technology\nemployed will contribute to the **[overall employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/7-ways-ai-can-improve-overall-employee-experience/)**.\n\nFrom the moment a job is posted, the employer brand of the organization is up\nfor scrutiny. Ever wondered why you are drawn more towards applying for a\ncertain job post than another even they are offering practically the same\npackage?\n\nOne reason for this cognitive bias we all tend to experience often depends on\nour predetermined notions of the employer brand.\n\nThe second reason is even more interesting \u2013 it has to do with our perception\nof the organization and role-based on subliminal cues and clues in the job\npost itself.\n\nFor example, you see two postings both from companies you know equally well,\nthe roles and locations are the same, and so is the compensation package.\nHowever, one posting is dry, monotonous, and cursory, while the other is a lot\nmore engaging in terms of content, more detailed, and makes you feel spoken to\npersonally. Which would you lean toward?\n\nA smart recruitment specialist needs to be able to consider all these subtle\nfactors while keeping in mind the target audience, the environment that they\nactively engage with, and the kind of technology and platforms that need to be\nused to gain access to them.\n\nGreat employee experience begins with engaging candidate experience, and the\nsmart recruiter of 2020 must be able to crack the code into engaging the right\ncandidate in the best way possible.\n\n**Also Read:** **[Top 10 Recruitment Analytics Tools for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nrecruitment-data-analytics-software/)**\n\n### **2\\. Technology is the primary collaborative tool**\n\n  \nA smart recruitment specialist cannot afford to look at technology as either a\ncrutch or a conundrum. The core idea for 2020 and beyond is to devise ways to\ncollaborate with technology offerings better. With [**AI tools and recruiting\nchatbots**](http://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-\nto-succeed-with-ai-in-recruiting/) already changing the way recruitment works,\nour expectations are only slated to soar higher.\n\nThe smart recruitment specialist needs to able to keep feelers on the market\nto understand, for example, the **[best human capital management (HCM)\nsuites](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/top-hcm-software-features/)** that simplifying the recruitment process by\ntying it together with the whole gamut of human resources functions. At the\nsame time, knowing how to choose from the top applicant tracking systems (ATS)\nwould help to create seamless recruitment processes.\n\nThere is sourcing and screening software \u2013 not to take away from recruiters\u2019\njobs but rather to add more time and ease that could then be invested in\nsmarter strategic planning of **[talent\npipelines](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-talent-pipeline/)**.\n\nWith these tools in place, the smart recruiter can now engage with a wider\ntalent pool, delve deeper into strategy, and connect with each candidate and\nemployee as an individual, thus adding to the quality of conversation and\nexperience that they can share.\n\n### **3\\. Smart recruitment is a journey**\n\n  \nRemember that the path to smart recruitment is not a destination but rather a\njourney. There will always be smarter recruitment as the years go by, but the\nsmart recruitment specialist must be able to place the organization on the\nsmart recruitment spectrum, on the trajectory for success.\n\nThe **[employee recruitment\nstrategies](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/top-ten-employee-recruitment-strategies/)** that need to be\ndeveloped, adapted to, and modified thus need to cater to the present and\nprojected needs of the organization. Smart recruiters need to take charge of\ntheir own upskilling journey to stay relevant and aware of the latest trends\nand developments in recruitment processes and technology.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Talent Acquisition Specialist: 10 Key Skill Requirements\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-specialist-key-skill-requirements/)**\n\nThe smart recruitment journey is a spectrum that covers the following\nmilestones:\n\n**1\\. Manual\u2013Mechanical:** Traditional and largely manual, homegrown,\nenterprise resource planning (ERP) HR modules mainly to control costs\n\n**2\\. Automated\u2013Augmented:** Limited and extended use of (largely standalone)\nsmart recruitment tools/solutions with a strong focus on efficiency and\neffectiveness\n\n**3\\. Intelligent\u2013Integrated:** Extensive integrated use of smart recruitment\ntools and solutions to drive efficiency, effectiveness, as well as build a\nstrong employer brand\n\n**4\\. Smart\u2013Predictive:** Smart recruitment solutions to crowdsource\ninternal/external data to continuously improve and build business objective-\nbased agile recruitment strategies\n\n**Learn More:[5 Affordable Recruitment Marketing Platforms You Need to Invest\nin for 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/affordable-recruitmentmarketingplatforms/)**\n\n## **Why Do You Need to Become a Smart Recruitment Specialist?**\n\nThe purpose of a smart recruitment specialist is to a) identify the milestone\nat which the organization is at present, and b) to then chart out a map for\nthe path to the next milestone organically and sustainably.\n\n![Why do you need to become a smart recruitment specialist](/images/ajax-\nloader.png)\n\n**_Figure 1. Why do you need to become a smart recruitment specialist_**\n\nThe primary broad benefits of becoming a smart recruiter and evolving on this\njourney are as follows:\n\n  * Building a workforce that is in tune with the present and prepared for the future\n  * Propelling the organization onward towards business success and evolution\n  * Creating a culture of sustainable change and adaptability\n  * Elevating recruitment processes and strategies and creating tangible value\n\n  \nWhile incorporating new technologies and approaches is needed, the best way to\nbecome and stay smart in today\u2019s VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and\nambiguous) environment is to be flexible. Rigidity is the enemy of evolution.\nSmart recruiters thus need to identify the changes as they are happening, to\nadapt their approach and processes, and to align with the new ever-changing\nbusiness reality.\n\n**_Are you a smart recruitment specialist?

One, the labor market is tight due to the low\nunemployment rate. Two, not many candidates have the skills companies need to\nfill gaps in their business process. Three, there is still a lack of synergy\nbetween business heads and recruitment and [talent\nacquisition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-acquisition/) specialists about merging talent\nrequirements with business goals.\n\nWhile reason three is something that must be resolved at the organizational\nlevel, problems one and two can be resolved by building specific strategies to\nhire the right people in the short term as well as the long term. To do this,\nlet\u2019s look into the key differences between talent acquisition and\nrecruitment.\n\n## **What Is the Difference Between Talent Acquisition and Recruitment?**\n\nRecruitment refers to the process of filling a vacancy as the need arises. For\ninstance, your star employee may have to relocate to another country, and you\nneed to fill their position during their notice period. To do this, you will\nrecruit another employee during that period, who you hope will be a star\nperformer too.\n\nRecruitment is a subset of talent acquisition. It involves the five stages of\n**[candidate sourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-sourcing/)** , lead nurturing, **[candidate\nselection](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-screening-and-selection/)** , interviewing, and\n**[onboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/)**.\n\nTalent acquisition is a broader hiring strategy. It involves developing a\nspecific hiring strategy, talent or **[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/)** , employer branding,\ncreation of a **[talent\npipeline](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-\nis-talent-pipeline/)** , and finally, recruitment.\n\n![Where recruitment stands in the talent acquisition process](/images/ajax-\nloader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. Where recruitment stands in the talent acquisition process**\n\nTA specialists foresee the recruitment requirements of the future by keeping a\nclose watch on the company\u2019s human resources and its growth. For example, 6\u20138\nmonths down the line, your organization is expected to expand into a new\nservice. This service will require employees with a range of skills, say\ndigital marketing to sales and public relations professionals to IT\nprofessionals.\n\nThe TA process will begin with a collaborative meeting between leadership and\nHR to first understand the skill requirements of the positions. Then, TA\nspecialists will formulate a plan to hire the employee to fill these\npositions.\n\nThen a [recruitment\nspecialist](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/how-to-become-a-smart-recruitment-specialist/) will leverage this\ntalent pipeline to begin the search for the required candidate based on the\ntalent acquisition strategy.\n\n**Read Also:** **[Top 12 Programmatic Advertising Trends for 2020 and\nBeyond](https://www.martechadvisor.com/articles/ads/programmatic-advertising-\ntrends/)**\n\n## **The Elements of Talent Acquisition and How They Enable Recruitment**\n\nTalent acquisition is an organization-wide effort. It does not just rest with\nthe small talent acquisition team in the HR function.\n\nFor instance, as a TA specialist, you will collaborate with the in-house\nmarketing team to improve your employer branding efforts. Collaborate with the\nIT team to gather data about past hiring strategies and the skills of\nemployees who have done well in certain jobs. Use this data to define the\n**[employee persona](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-an-employee-persona/)** you are targeting and build your\nstrategy accordingly.\n\nHere\u2019s what defines the talent acquisition process and how these elements\nsimplify recruitment.\n\n### **1\\. Assessing the current workforce and the business needs**\n\n  \nTA specialists must have in-depth knowledge of the business they serve and the\nworkforce requirements of this business \u2013 for example, how it is segmented and\nwhich segment has the highest demand. They must remain in touch with this\nworkforce and its expanding needs to fulfill talent requirements as and when\nthey arise.\n\nTo do this, they must identify key metrics or parameters they need to assess \u2013\nfor example, skills gap and culture fit. Then, they can use analytics to\nidentify where the skills gap lies and whether hiring externally or training\ninternally may be a better option for workforce optimization and talent\nmanagement.\n\nAll this data can be sourced from IT and respective line managers and built\nupon using AI-powered predictive analytics tools to simplify the process.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Talent Management? Definition, Strategy, Process\nand Model**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/)\n\n### **2\\. Engaging in recruitment marketing to build an employer brand**\n\n  \nThe importance of having a positive employer brand in an era when practically\nall information is transparent cannot be stressed enough. Candidates may need\njobs, but they are also aware of how they want their experience at work to be.\n\nA talent acquisition strategy will use the data from the workforce evaluation\nmentioned above and design a well-thought-out **[recruitment\nmarketing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-recruitment-marketing-and-how-do-best-employers-use-it/)**\nplan to create a memorable employer brand.\n\nThis means considering generational differences and catering to the needs of\neach generation. For instance, millennials place importance on career\ndevelopment, so that will be the USP of the employer branding strategy. For\nthe Gen Z workforce, being part of a sustainable organization may be\nimportant. Use the USPs of your organization to attract the right talent.\n\n### **3\\. Building a talent pipeline for strategic, leadership positions**\n\n  \nNurturing relationships with active and passive candidates is essential to\nbuild a talent pipeline. TA specialists must forecast the needs of the\norganization and use succession planning to determine which leadership gaps\ncan be filled internally and which gaps need external hiring.\n\nBuilding a relationship with such candidates requires time and an active\ncandidate relationship management strategy. At this point, using the\ntechnology available for such a process becomes imperative if TA professionals\nwant to build a pipeline they can harness as the need arises.\n\nSeveral platforms are available that improve the **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\nand help recruiters and talent acquisition professionals build positive\nrelationships with candidates.\n\nIt is these processes that lay the foundation of quick, results-oriented\nrecruitment efforts.\n\n## **When to Engage in Talent Acquisition Vs. Recruitment**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, recruitment is a rather reactive process. You recruit in\nreaction to an existing vacancy. Talent acquisition, on the other hand, is\nproactive. You prepare to recruit even when you have a fully optimized\nworkforce because you are predicting the future needs of an organization.\n\nAs a practice, having a TA strategy in place regardless of the age and size of\nyour organization is imperative. But it is far more important to have one in\ncase of the following situations.\n\n### **1\\. When starting a new business segment or a new business**\n\n  \nHiring for the future involves hiring for new positions, new skills, and new\ntechnologies. So, when an organization starts a new business segment and you\nneed to find people to run that segment, you must have a TA strategy in place.\n\nSimilar is the case with a new business altogether. The workforce must be\nbuilt from the ground up. This means working to attract the right talent that\nwill stay.\n\nRecruitment takes over from talent acquisition when the strategy is in place\nand when it has begun to attract candidates.\n\n### **2\\. To hire for skills, but not a specific role in the organization**\n\n  \nKeep in mind that building a talent pipeline based on skills can help you\ntremendously when hiring for your organization. It may not be necessary to\nknow exactly which role a certain candidate may fill. But having a set of\nskills that can be matched with a role that may arise in the future is one \u2013\nand a highly valuable \u2013 way to go about it.\n\nAs a result, a TA specialist will focus on the skills someone brings to the\ntable, regardless of their educational background. They may even assess the\npotential for skills development on the job. A [recruitment specialist\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-to-\nbecome-a-smart-recruitment-specialist/)may, however, focus on experience and\ncertifications to fulfill the immediate requirement of the business.\n\nWhen you have performed a skills gap analysis and know exactly which skills\nyou need to hire for, you need a strategy that will help you find these\nprofessionals and close those gaps.\n\nThe strategy to hire marketers will be different from the strategy to hire\ncoders. The strategy to hire finance professionals will be different from the\nstrategy to hire writers. Often, recruitment and talent acquisition strategies\nfail because the hiring method does not change with each role.\n\nFor example, your strategy to hire coders may be to invite them to the now\npopular method of finding them \u2013 hackathons. On the other hand, your strategy\nto hire writers may be to give them the end of a story and have them build\ntheir way backward into a well-planned and written paper.\n\nRecruiters will then work on shortlisting candidates for these activities,\nassessing their fit for the role along with line managers, and proceed to\ninterview and hire these candidates.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is recruitment? Definition, process, techniques and\nmethods with examples for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-\nrecruitment/)**\n\n### **3\\. To increase diversity hiring efforts**\n\n  \nDiversity is a compliance regulation you must meet, but it is also a way to\nget the most innovative minds working for you. Short-term recruitment alone\ncannot meet your diversity hiring goals. This requires a well-planned strategy\nto hire diverse professionals in various roles across the organization.\n\nIt is here that [candidate\nscreening](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-screening-and-selection/) technology can truly\nhelp you because it can help screen for skills and experience rather than\npeople. As humans, we harbor a lot of unconscious biases we don\u2019t notice, and\nthat can show up in the way we hire. Once a candidate screening software has\nevaluated candidates for the skills they can bring to the organization, you\ncan then go on to build healthy relationships with them.\n\n## **Both Recruiters and Talent Acquisition Specialists Must Collaborate With\nTech to Stay Relevant**\n\nRecruitment and talent acquisition are not separate from each other. And they\nboth serve very specific purposes at different times. A talent acquisition\nstrategy considers recruitment technologies in place to enable efficient\nrecruitment. Recruitment involves using this technology to then go ahead and\nhire.\n\nWhat both TA specialists and recruiters need is skill development to\ncollaborate efficiently with artificial intelligence and other technologies.\nThe outcome of using AI in recruitment and TA is well-known. As we head into\n2020 and further, AI is expected to become the mainstay of all aspects of the\nHR function. This is essential as the talent and technology landscape both\nevolve, and greater effort is needed to devise unique talent acquisition and\nrecruitment strategies.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is Full Cycle Recruiting?

around data privacy and bias reduction continue to\nabound.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | December 31, 2019 \u2022 6 min read\n\nTopics: [Employment Law](https://hrexecutive.com/category/employmentlaw/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) |\n[Recruiting](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/recruiting/) |\n[Talent Management](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/AI_Legal-700x465.jpg)\n\nWith [artificial intelligence becoming all the rage across the HR\nworld](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-hr-in-the-age-of-artificial-\nintelligence/), there clearly appears to be rewards from using AI to find and\nland the best talent. But at what price?\n\nDo AI-based tools in recruiting and hiring really outperform human decision-\nmaking? And if they do, could they potentially expose HR and employers to the\nsame types of discrimination issues that can impact hiring driven by people,\nnot algorithms? Right now, the legal landscape in the U.S. has yet to catch up\nthose critical considerations.\n\nIn Europe, for instance, the U.K.'s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office recently\nreleased [guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-\nprotection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/special-\ncategory-data/) for organizations about transparency within AI decision-\nmaking. That effort is part of a larger European-wide data-privacy effort, the\n[General Data Protection Regulation](https://hrexecutive.com/protecting-data-\nabroad/).\n\nHere in the U.S., legal experts say there's a long way to go for regulatory\nand legal initiatives around the potential privacy and other data-related\ncomplications that could surface using AI within HR.\n\nOn the federal level so far, there is the Algorithmic Accountability Act\n(AAA), introduced earlier this year by Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Ron\nWyden (D-Ore.). Here, Booker and Wyden asked the Federal Trade Commission, the\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services and five major healthcare companies\nto \u201cprovide more information on how they are addressing bias in algorithms\nused in many healthcare systems.\u201d While this specific proposal is not aimed at\nHR issues per se, it\u2019s a start on regulating the use of AI when it comes to\ndata-privacy issues related to healthcare consumers.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nOn the state level, in 2019 Illinois passed the Transparency, Consent and Data\nDestruction Duties Central to AI Video Interview Act, the first state law\nregulating the use of AI in hiring. The statute, which becomes effective Jan.\n1, 2020, specifically requires employers hiring for jobs \u201cbased in\u201d Illinois\nthat use \u201cartificial intelligence analysis\u201d of video interviews to:\n\n  * notify the applicant, in advance, that the organization is using the technology to analyze video interviews;\n  * explain to the applicant \u201chow the [AI] works\u201d and what general characteristics the technology uses to evaluate applicants;\n  * obtain, in advance, the applicant\u2019s consent to use the technology;\n  * limit the distribution and sharing of the video to only those persons \u201cwhose expertise or technology\u201d is necessary to evaluate the applicant; and\n  * upon request from the applicant, destroy the video (and all backup copies) within 30 days upon the applicant\u2019s request.\n\nThere is no denying it: AI is making inroads [throughout the recruiting\nspace](https://hrexecutive.com/how-ai-and-recruiting-go-hand-in-hand/). But\nlegal experts say employers choosing HR to make hiring decisions should tread\ncarefully.\n\nCatherine Barbieri, a partner in the labor and employment practice at Fox\nRothschild in Philadelphia, says that, when programmed correctly and audited\nregularly, AI has the ability to eliminate bias in the hiring process.\n\n\u201cAI is being used to screen resumes, interview candidates and ensure more\ndiverse candidate pools, and to answer candidates\u2019 questions about the hiring\nprocess,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, AI is not perfect, and it is only as good as the\ndata and algorithms that it uses.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, she says, companies\u2019 collection and retention of candidate\nvideos and other biometric data may give rise to other notice and document-\nretention obligations under state law that do not exist in the human-initiated\nscreening and interviewing process.\n\nBarbieri says that, when using AI to [eliminate human bias from the hiring\nprocess](https://hrexecutive.com/how-to-use-machine-learning-to-reduce-\nrecruiting-bias/), HR professionals need to ensure that algorithms or data the\nAI is employing are not creating a new issue by favoring certain\ncharacteristics more tied to male or non-diverse candidates or cultures.\nExamples of this include chatbots that react negatively to candidates who\nshake their heads or fail to smile widely, tendencies that could be culture-\nspecific.\n\n\u201cHR professionals should ensure that they understand fully, and approve of,\nthe factors and characteristics that are being taken into consideration by AI\nin the hiring process,\u201d she says. \u201cHR also needs to treat any hiring data\ngathered by AI like it does any other confidential company data, and\nexplicitly include it in its confidentiality and data-breach policies and\nprocedures.\u201d\n\nAs for the current, albeit limited, legislation focused on data privacy,\nBarbieri says, while the type of auditing that the AAA law would require\nshould help reduce bias in the AI\u2019s algorithms, it won\u2019t apply to most\nemployers.\n\nOn the Illinois act, she says, it\u2019s not the first time the state has been in\nthe vanguard on data-privacy issues, having also been the first state to\nregulate an employer\u2019s use of employees\u2019 biometric data in 2008. Other states\nhave followed Illinois\u2019 lead in the area of biometric data.\n\n\u201cWhile there is no indication yet that other states will pass similar AI-\nrelated legislation that will affect HR, it is instructive that roughly 60% of\nstates have adopted some form of legislation concerning autonomous vehicles in\nresponse to safety concerns around that new technology,\u201d she says. \u201cIt may be\nthat, as the risks of AI-based hiring manifest themselves, other states will\npass legislation to address the potential privacy and discrimination risks\nthat AI poses.\u201d\n\nWashington, D.C.-based Randel Johnson, a partner in the Labor and Employment\narea at Seyfarth Shaw, says the use of artificial AI permeates virtually all\naspects of society, though its use in the HR area is actually a relatively\nsmall part.\n\n\u201cWhile there are multiple uses in the employment context, the most predominant\nis in leveraging AI tools to more quickly and efficiently match candidates to\njobs. The business case is clear,\u201d Johnson says, noting that some will argue\nthat AI tools reduce the possibility of unconscious biases in the hiring\nprocesses and, in fact, can expand the pool of applicants.\n\nHowever, he notes, the use of AI in this way has surfaced criticisms as\npotentially disadvantaging employee groups who do not fit pre-established\ncriteria underpinning the algorithms that developed the profile of who will be\nthe most successful performer in the job in question.\n\n\u201cAt the back end of these discussions are questions over the \u2018black box\u2019\nnature of AI algorithms, and the understandable hesitancy of vendors to reveal\nproprietary information,\u201d Johnson says. Further, he says, questions exist over\nwhether current law governing validation of selection procedures under\ndisparate-impact analysis fits this new method of hiring, trying to fit \u201ca\nsquare peg into a round hole.\u201d\n\nAnnette Tyman, a labor and employment partner in Seyfarth Shaw\u2019s Chicago\noffice, adds that, perhaps not surprisingly, public polling has displayed a\nsuspicion of the use AI in hiring and indicated a preference for the more\ntraditional one-on-one hiring practices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n\n\u201cDeciphering the pros and cons of AI in the workplace\u2014and how to govern\npossible abuses while allowing technology to promote legitimate increases in\nefficiencies\u2014are not easy tasks,\u201d she says, adding that these are difficult\nissues thatCapitol Hill is only beginning to wrestle with.\n\nTyman explains that the Algorithmic Accountability Act is clear notice that\nCongress believes something needs to be done, but by leaving much of the\njudgment calls to the FTC, the sponsors acknowledge that it is difficult to\ncreate a proper path forward.\n\nShe says that, while there is little chance AAA will move forward, it should\nbe noted that [draft legislation on\nprivacy](https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/COPRA%20Bill%20Text.pdf)\nbeing circulated by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and a [separate draft\nbill](https://privacyblogfullservice.huntonwilliamsblogs.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/28/2019/12/Nc7.pdf) by Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.),\nranking and chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, respectively, both plant a\nflag on the AI issue.\n\n\u201cSen. Wicker\u2019s bill properly establishes a commission to look at this entire\narea and includes a precedent-setting preemption of state-law provision,\u201d\nTyman says. \u201cCongress moves slowly, but we can anticipate that it will step\nin, given growing questions and public perceptions. However, earliest\nindication are good that it will not act precipitously.\u201d\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

And finding the person who\nticks all the boxes is even more challenging in this strong economy. With the\nnational unemployment rate down at just 3.6%, employers are competing to lock\ndown top talent.\n\nIf you too are on the lookout for new workers, then you\u2019ll be glad to know\nwe\u2019ve compiled a list of 70 recruitment statistics to help you create an\neffective hiring strategy.\n\nWe\u2019ve gathered the most relevant stats about the current state of the\nrecruiting industry and the hiring process. You\u2019ll also find information on\nthe latest recruiting trends and the benefits of creating a diverse workforce.\nWe believe a little empathy goes a long way, so we\u2019ve also included statistics\nabout how candidates feel throughout the experience.\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s take a look at our list.\n\n## Attention-Grabbing Hiring Stats\n\n  * More than 73% of job seekers today are only passively looking for a job.\n  * The candidate application rate goes up by 34% when a job post includes a video.\n  * 54% of hiring professionals say work flexibility encourages retention and 51% agree it attracts candidates.\n  * 80% of HR leaders say employer branding has a significant impact on their ability to attract talent. \n  * On average, a corporate job post receives 250 resumes.\n  * It takes recruiters only six seconds to revise a candidate\u2019s resume.\n  * Top talent gets hired by recruiters within 10 days.\n  * 73% of job seekers say the process of looking for a job is one of the most stressful events in life.\n  * 83% of candidates say it would greatly improve the overall experience if employers provided a clear timeline of the hiring process.\n\nOnly 25% of companies set gender diversity targets when creating their hiring\nstrategy.\n\n### Current Job Market\n\n#### 1\\. The national unemployment rate fell below 4% in 2019.\n\n(Bureau of Labor Statistics)\n\nThe year began with a fairly low unemployment rate of 4% in January and has\nonly decreased since. In fact, the unemployment rate has now reached its\nlowest level since 1969; in April and May it was just 3.6%. According to the\nlatest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in July alone approximately\n164,000 jobs were created.\n\n#### 2\\. There have been 0.9 unemployed people per job opening in the US since\nSeptember 2018.\n\n(Bureau of Labor Statistics)\n\nEmployment statistics confirm that the US job market is currently a\ncandidates\u2019 market. With a hot streak of low unemployment numbers, companies\nare having a tough time finding the right workers. There simply aren\u2019t enough\njob seekers since the ratio of unemployed people to job openings fell below\n1:1 at the end of last year.\n\n#### 3\\. 45% of job seekers say it\u2019s harder to find a job than last year.\n\n(Jobvite)\n\nDespite a booming economy and low unemployment, nearly half of all job seekers\nfeel it\u2019s more difficult to land a job in 2019 than it was a year ago. Rural\nworkers are more likely to say this than city slickers, with 27% and 17% of\nrespondents respectively giving this answer. Job search statistics also show\nthat most candidates from the transportation and real estate industries (56%)\nfind job hunting more challenging this year than they did last year.\n\n#### 4\\. On the other hand, 20% of job seekers also say it\u2019s easier to find\nwork in 2019.\n\n(Jobvite)\n\nOn the contrary, a fifth of all job seekers had no difficulty finding\nemployment this year. Some 20% of candidates with a college degree and 20%\nresiding in big cities said job search was easier this year. Even more workers\nfrom \u201chigh-skill\u201d industries feel this way. A quarter of those looking for\nwork in the tech industry, in telecommunications, and in marketing said it was\neasier to get a job this year compared to last year.\n\n#### 5\\. 40% of employers plan to hire full-time, permanent employees this\nyear.\n\n(The Harris Poll)\n\nAccording to the Harris Poll\u2019s annual recruitment statistics, four in 10\nemployers reported intent to take on new full-time employees in 2019. Another\n47% planned to recruit part-time workers, highlighting the strength of the\neconomy.\n\n#### 6\\. 66% of US companies were planning to expand in 2019.\n\n(GMAC)\n\nMost corporate employers in the US have expressed optimism for this year, with\nabout two in three companies overall reporting plans to growing their human\ncapital and expand their business. This might turn out to be difficult with a\nshortage of workers. However, offering competitive benefits could sway\nprofessionals to leave their current positions and come work for new\nemployers.\n\n#### 7\\. More than 73% of job seekers today are only passively looking for a\njob.\n\n(Workonic)\n\nWorkonic\u2019s job search stats reveal that nearly three-quarters of American job\nhunters aren\u2019t actively looking for a new job but would consider one if the\nright opportunity came along.\n\n#### 8\\. More than one in four working Americans weren\u2019t searching for a job\nwhen they found their current job.\n\n(iCIMS)\n\nA lot of people are just somewhat satisfied with their role and wouldn\u2019t mind\nchanging employers if a better position came up. However, employers seem to be\nmissing out on passive job seekers, since 42% of employed Americans say they\nhaven\u2019t been contacted by a recruiter in the past year.\n\n#### 9\\. 19% of workers admit they have, at some point, turned down a job\nafter signing an official offer but before their first day.\n\n(Jobvite)\n\nJobvite\u2019s hiring stats show an eight-point increase from last year\u2019s results,\nwhen only 11% of the US workforce admitted to having bailed on an employer. Of\nthose who back down on a signed offer, 58% say they got a better one from\nanother company. Another 38% cite personal reasons for such a move, 28% decide\nto stay at their current company, while 17% discover new information about the\ncompany\u2019s culture that changes their mind. Some respondents gave more than one\nanswer to this question.\n\n#### 10\\. More than 20% of recruiters feel they cannot meet the demands of the\nbest candidates.\n\n(Workonic)\n\nIn this candidates\u2019 market, job seekers get to be picky about the company they\nwant to work for. They ask for all the perks they deserve and employers\ncompete for who\u2019ll meet their demands. Unfortunately, hiring statistics reveal\nthat one in five talent-acquisition specialists admit their companies can\u2019t\ndeliver what worthy candidates ask for.\n\n#### 11\\. The median employee tenure for all occupations in the US is 4.2\nyears.\n\n(Bureau of Labor Statistics)\n\nOnce the hiring process is complete, workers tend to stay with a company for\njust over four years. Employees aged 55 to 64 have a median tenure of 10.1\nyears, which is more than three times what their younger counterparts aged 25\nto 34 have (2.8 years).\n\n#### 12\\. Gig economy workers make up 36% of the US workforce.\n\n(Gallup)\n\nGallup\u2019s statistics about the job market show that over a third of the\nAmerican workforce participates in the gig economy through either their\nprimary or secondary jobs. This might seem like a large percentage, but think\nabout all the Uber drivers out there. Then there\u2019s independent contractors\nlike translators, writers, and marketers. The number of these non-traditional,\nindependent, short-term working relationships is projected to jump to 43% by\n2020.\n\n#### 13\\. Corporate employers plan to offer new hires holding an MBA degree a\nmedian starting salary of $115,000 per year in 2019.\n\n(GMAC)\n\nHiring candidates with the right set of skills and knowledge is a tough task\nin this competitive market. That\u2019s why employers looking to hire candidates\nwith MBAs offer big bucks. Hoping to attract the right talent, recruiters plan\nto provide annual salaries of around $115,000. This is more than double the\namount they\u2019re giving new employees with bachelor\u2019s degrees: $55,000.\n\n#### 14\\. 4,000 jobs were lost in the retail sector in July 2019.\n\n(Bureau of Labor Statistics)\n\nAnd while highly qualified white-collar workers find themselves in an\nexcellent position in the current economy, some blue-collar workers are going\nthrough a rough patch. The retail sector witnessed 4,000 layoffs in the month\nof July alone, while the number of mining and logging jobs decreased by 5,000\nduring the same month, according to jobs statistics published by the BLS in\nAugust 2019.\n\n#### 15\\. 75% of the global workforce will consist of millennials in 2025.\n\n(Deloitte)\n\nAs aging baby boomers leave the workforce, millennials are becoming the\ndominant generation and calling most of the shots in the workplace. Employer\nloyalty might turn out to be one of the biggest challenges for HR specialists,\nsince 25% of millennials plan to leave their company in the next 12 months.\n\n#### 16\\. Millennial turnover costs the US economy $30.5 billion annually.\n\n(Gallup)\n\nGallup\u2019s job change statistics signal that employer loyalty already poses a\nproblem among this demographic. According to the company\u2019s research, 21% of\nmillennials have changed jobs during the past year, compared to only 7% of\nrespondents from other generations. This high turnover rate among workers born\nbetween the early 1980s and the 2000s places a huge burden on the American\neconomy, costing $30.5 billion per year.\n\n#### 17\\. 74% of US talent professionals say anti-harassment strategies are\nvery important to the future of recruiting and HR.\n\n(LinkedIn)\n\nCompany culture is an increasingly important factor candidates consider when\nchoosing their workplace. If a company is known for poorly handling harassment\ncases, its reputation sinks with it. That\u2019s why, according to Linkedin\u2019s\nhiring statistics for 2019, almost three-quarters of recruiters agree that\nanti-harassment policies and practices will be essential in future hiring\nstrategies.\n\n### Recruiting Trends\n\n#### 18\\. 45% of employers say they can\u2019t find the workers with the skills\nthey need.\n\n(Manpower Group)\n\nA survey conducted by Manpower Group that included around 40,000 employers\nfrom 43 countries shows that recruiters around the globe are experiencing\ndifficulty filling positions. In fact, HR leaders reported the highest levels\nof talent shortages since 2006 when the research was first carried out.\n\n#### 19\\. 27% of employers say candidates don\u2019t have either the interpersonal\naptitude or job skills they\u2019re looking for.\n\n(Manpower Group)\n\nRecruitment data gathered in the same study reveals that 27% of employers\nattribute the talent shortage to applicants\u2019 lack of required skills and\nstrength of character. Another 29% of global recruiters say the sheer lack of\ncandidates applying for the job is the reason they can\u2019t hire the right\npersonnel.\n\n#### 20\\. 54% of employers provide additional training and development in\norder to overcome talent shortages.\n\n(Manpower Group)\n\nWith plans for growth and expansion on one side and a lack of skilled\napplicants on the other, more than half of employers looking for workers are\nstepping up. If they can\u2019t find candidates with the right skills, they have to\ntrain prospective workers and provide them with the required expertise.\n\nRecruitment industry trends show that employers are also lowering their\neducation and experience requirements (36%) and recruiting from outside the\ntraditional talent pool (33%) in an attempt to tackle the talent-shortage\nconundrum.\n\n#### 21\\. Since 2016, there has been a 78% increase in LinkedIn job posts that\nhighlight work flexibility.\n\n(LinkedIn)\n\nLinkedIn\u2019s 2019 Global Talent Trends Report highlights a huge spike in the\nnumber of job posts mentioning flexibility in the past three years. As\nemployees\u2019 ability to work remotely and at hours that suit them becomes the\nnorm, companies who provide these conditions early on are at a great\nadvantage.\n\n#### 22\\. 54% of hiring professionals say work flexibility encourages\nretention and 51% agree it attracts candidates.\n\n(LinkedIn)\n\nEmployers who follow this hiring trend have a better shot at acquiring top\ntalent as well as [retaining workers](https://www.talentlms.com/blog/how-\nemployee-analytics-improve-talent-retention/). In today\u2019s fast-paced world,\nemployees really appreciate the possibility of working from home and the\nfreedom to set their own hours. The perks of a flexible work environment\naccount for a higher job satisfaction rate and a better work-life balance.\n\n#### 23\\. 67% of job seekers try to find information about salaries when\nresearching a company or looking at job ads.\n\n(Glassdoor)\n\nThe majority of job seekers focus on money when skimming through a job post.\nIt\u2019s a high priority for nearly 70% of applicants, according to job searching\nstatistics published by Glassdoor earlier this year. Benefits come in as a\nclose second, with 63% of candidates looking for this information in a job ad.\n\n#### 24\\. Only 27% of businesses share salary ranges publicly.\n\n(LinkedIn)\n\nEven though candidates are eager to know what their salary would be, only 27%\nof companies disclose this information publicly. Of those who don\u2019t shy away\nfrom sharing salary ranges, 67% inform candidates early on in the hiring\nprocess. A further 59% share ranges with employees and only 48% share ranges\npublicly on job posts.\n\n#### 25\\. 75% of companies that don\u2019t disclose salary information do so\nbecause they fear it would create salary disputes.\n\n(LinkedIn)\n\nWhile sharing salary ranges decreases the average time to hire, a lot of\ncompanies remain reserved. According to LinkedIn recruiting statistics, 75% of\nemployers who are not open about compensation with both their workers and\napplicants say they\u2019re concerned about causing salary disputes. Another 34%\nworry it would harm their negotiating position.\n\n#### 26\\. 13% of AI job advertisements on Glassdoor\u2019s US site are posted by\nAmazon.\n\n(Glassdoor)\n\nAs AI replaces more and more menial jobs, large companies are increasing the\namount they invest in developing and proliferating the technology. In the US,\nAmazon stands out as the employer looking to hire the most AI workers, with 64\nactive AI job posts on Glassdoor. NVIDIA and Microsoft are the second- and\nthird-largest employers in the sector, posting 6% and 4% of the AI job ads on\nthe same network respectively.\n\n#### 27\\. Eight in 10 employers say soft skills are increasingly important to\ncompany success.\n\n(LinkedIn)\n\nOne of the growing trends in recruitment is the search for employees who\npossess soft skills. As many as 80% of HR specialists say they have a hard\ntime filling some positions because many otherwise qualified candidates lack\nthe necessary soft skills for the jobs. Among the skills in highest demand and\nlowest supply are creativity, persuasion, collaboration, adaptability, and\ntime-management skills.\n\n#### 28\\. More than 80% of HR leaders say employer branding significantly on\ntheir ability to attract talent.\n\n(Undercover Recruiter)\n\nEmployer branding statistics published by Undercover Recruiter speak volumes\nabout the importance of having a positive employer brand. When a company is\nrenowned for treating its staff well, candidates line up whenever a position\nopens up. Such employers barely notice the talent shortage others are\ncurrently struggling with.\n\n#### 29\\. Nearly two in three job seekers acknowledge that they are less\nlikely to apply for a job through a social network due to recent security\nbreaches.\n\n(iCIMS)\n\nOverall, 65% of candidates feel apprehensive about submitting job applications\nthrough social media because they fear their personal data might get into the\nwrong hands. Baby boomers are the most suspicious of such an application\nprocess, with 69% saying they would avoid it. Similarly, 67% of millennials\nand 60% of people from Generation X feel the same way, according to social\nmedia recruitment stats.\n\n#### 30\\. In 2018, 43% of all open jobs at tech companies on Glassdoor were\nfor non-technical roles.\n\n(Glassdoor)\n\nNon-tech positions have been opening up faster than ever in the tech industry.\nThe most sought-after candidates are those with sales skills. This is no\nsurprise given that the top five roles that needed filling in 2018 were\naccount executives, project managers, sales representatives, operations\nmanagers, and account managers.\n\n#### 31\\. The number of blockchain-related job posts on Glassdoor in August\n2018 was 300% higher than in August 2017.\n\n(Glassdoor)\n\nGlobal tech recruiters are fighting over the limited talent pool in this\ntechnical niche. As Glassdoor data shows, the number of job openings in the\nblockchain industry tripled in the 12-month period between August 2017 and\n2018.\n\n#### 32\\. The average salary for blockchain jobs is $84,884 per year.\n\n(Glassdoor)\n\nThis emerging technology that has the potential to transform the financial\nworld forever is not only in high demand, but it\u2019s well paid, too. The annual\nsalaries of blockchain specialists tend to be around $85,000, exceeding the\nnational average of $52,461 by 62%.\n\n#### 33\\. With roughly three million applicants per year, Google has an\nacceptance rate of just 0.2%.\n\n(CNBC)\n\nGoogle hiring statistics reveal just how difficult it is to become a Google\nemployee. While the search engine company is acclaimed as a wonderful place to\nwork, receiving awards for top employer year after year, it\u2019s nearly\nimpossible to get a job offer from Google. The competition is as fierce as the\nrecruitment procedure is long.\n\n#### 34\\. The candidate application rate goes up by 34% when a job post\nincludes a video.\n\n(Career Builder)\n\nIf you would like to broaden your talent pool, consider adding a recruitment\nvideo to your job post. A study conducted by Career Builder shows that people\nrespond very well to video material. More applicants will be inspired to\ncontact you if you include a [video](https://www.smallbizgenius.net/by-the-\nnumbers/video-marketing-statistics/) that depicts your company culture or\nshares the day-to-day experience of your employees.\n\n### Hiring Process\n\n#### 35\\. On average, a corporate job post receives 250 resumes.\n\n(EBI)\n\nIf you were wondering how many applicants there are per job post, here\u2019s your\nanswer. Job application statistics indicate that some 250 candidates apply\nwhen a position opens up in a large corporation. Though this piece of\ninformation seems encouraging, going back to the second stat will give you a\ndose of reality. Even if a lot of people apply, unfortunately many of them\ndon\u2019t meet the basic requirements.\n\n#### 36\\. It takes recruiters only six seconds to evaluate a candidate\u2019s\nresume.\n\n(The Ladders)\n\nWith a slew of CVs to go through and a deadline for bringing in new workers,\nHR specialists need to be efficient. And according to this stat, they are.\nResume statistics show it takes recruiters just six seconds to decide if a\ncandidate will go to the next round. How did researchers come up with this\nnumber? By analyzing the eye-movement of hundreds of recruiters while they\nevaluated CVs.\n\n#### 37\\. Only 2% of applicants are called for an interview for the average\njob opening.\n\n(EBI)\n\nAccording to EBI\u2019s interview statistics, only a small fraction of job seekers\nget called back for a meeting with a company representative in person.\nDeciding which candidates are worthy of one-on-one attention and your time\ndefinitely isn\u2019t easy. Unfortunately, you need to eliminate most candidates\nbased on their CVs to streamline the hiring process.\n\n#### 38\\. The best candidates only have to wait 10 days to find a new job.\n\n(Workonic)\n\nHigh-quality candidates with loads of experience, robust soft skills, and a\nnetwork of contacts have an average job search time of only 10 days. HR\nmanagers should take this into consideration when they spot a promising\napplicant. If they want that candidate to join the company, they need to act\nquickly.\n\n#### 39\\. 64% of prospective workers would rather hear about the success of\ntheir job application via text than through an email or a phone call.\n\n(Jobvite)\n\nTwo-thirds of job seekers would rather be contacted via text message than via\nemail or phone call. It appears recruiters are aware of this and tend to\nadjust their method of communication according to the applicant\u2019s age.\nJobvite\u2019s recruitment statistics from 2019 show that 44% of candidates under\n40 get a text from a recruiter compared to only 24% of older applicants.\n\n#### 40\\. 48% of businesses say their high-quality hires come from employee\nreferrals.\n\n(Linkedin)\n\nIf you are an employer looking for new employees, your best bet is to ask your\ncurrent staff if they can recommend someone. Nearly 50% of business owners\ncite employee referrals as their top source of quality workers. Other places\nfor sourcing great talent include third-party websites, online job boards, and\nprofessional social networks, according to 46% and 40% of recruiters\nrespectively.\n\n#### 41\\. 51% of talent professionals recruit throughout the calendar year for\npositions that may open up later on.\n\n(The Harris Poll)\n\nHiring statistics published in The Harris Poll\u2019s annual survey reveal that\nhalf of HR managers never stop hiring. In fact, they\u2019re on the lookout for\nquality candidates all year round. Of those who continuously recruit, 55% say\ntheir time-to-hire goes down thanks to this practice and 42% say it reduces\ntheir cost-per-hire.\n\n#### 42\\. 82% of recruitment professionals say they view candidates\u2019\nexperience as very or extremely important.\n\n(Career Builder)\n\nA little over eight in 10 HR specialists consider candidate experience highly\nimportant. And they should, since roughly as many job seekers (78%) say they\nform their opinion of the employer based on how they are treated during the\napplication process.\n\n#### 43\\. 59% of companies assess candidates on their soft skills.\n\n(Workonic)\n\nWorkonic\u2019s recruiting industry statistics indicate just how much employers\nvalue soft skills. Almost 60% of recruiters judge candidates based on their\npersonality traits, social skills, emotional intelligence, and other skills\nthey deem necessary for successfully doing the job at hand.\n\n#### 44\\. A recruiter\u2019s conversation skills (40%) and appearance or personal\nstyle (37%) often prove to be the decisive factors that impact candidates\u2019\nview of the company.\n\n(Jobvite)\n\nAnd while HR specialists are judging the applicants, applicants are judging\nthem right back. Those who work in recruitment are candidates\u2019 first point of\ncontact with any company, so it\u2019s only natural that applicants form their\nopinion of the enterprise based on how well the HR employees converse and\ndress.\n\n#### 45\\. 60% of applicants are at least somewhat comfortable negotiating\ntheir salary and working conditions.\n\n(Jobvite)\n\nAs job seekers become aware of the fact that the current job market is a\ncandidates\u2019 market, they get more comfortable negotiating with employers.\nRecruiting statistics show a nine-point increase compared to last year, when\n51% of job seekers reported being open to negotiation.\n\n#### 46\\. 69% of men and 51% of women say they would enter into salary\nnegotiations with an employer.\n\n(Jobvite)\n\nThe figures show that men tend to be more confident than women in the\nworkplace. This is true in the early stages, too. Even before securing a job,\nmen boldly ask for better conditions more often than their female\ncounterparts, according to Jobvite\u2019s hiring stats.\n\n### Job Seekers\u2019 Point of View\n\n#### 47\\. 73% of job seekers say the process of looking for a job is one of\nthe most stressful events in life.\n\n(Career Builder)\n\nAll that waiting and high hopes that amount to nothing leave candidates\nstressed out by the job hunt. Almost three-quarters of candidates view the\nprocess as a very stressful life event, according to Career Builder\u2019s\nCandidate Experience Report.\n\n#### 48\\. Lack of information about pay and benefits (50%) and interview\nschedule changes (50%) are the two main reasons job seekers view the search as\nstressful.\n\n(Glassdoor)\n\nGlassdoor\u2019s recruitments statistics have localized the cause of frustration\ncandidates feel when looking for work. Applicants don\u2019t appreciate mystery\nregarding salary and benefits, nor do they like when employers disrespect them\nby changing the interview time. Untimely responses (47%) and a lack of\ninformation about job responsibilities (46%) are also disheartening for\ncandidates.\n\n#### 49\\. 83% of candidates say it would greatly improve the overall\nexperience if employers provided a clear timeline of the hiring process.\n\n(Career Builder)\n\nFor most candidates, being in the dark is one of the worst parts of the job\nhunt. The vast majority would feel much better if employers searching for\nemployees set some expectations about the length of the hiring process.\n\n#### 50\\. Across all skill levels, nearly a third of US workers were looking\nto change jobs in 2019.\n\n(The Harris Poll)\n\nThe latest stats on jobs show that 32% of American employees would like to get\na new job this year. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they want to change their\nemployer; some would be happy with a promotion within their current company.\n\n#### 51\\. 24% of unemployed job seekers consider company culture an important\nfactor when deciding to apply for a job.\n\n(Jobvite)\n\nWhen people are having trouble getting a job, company culture becomes a\nsecondary concern. They cannot afford the luxury to be picky and discard a\npotential bread-winning opportunity just because they have read negative\nreviews about the work environment in a particular organization. Their\nemployed counterparts, on the other hand, can. Recruitment trends indicate\nthat 38% of job seekers who can count on a regular paycheck take\norganizational culture under serious consideration.\n\n#### 52\\. More than 70% of candidates apply for jobs in the same metro area,\nwhile 28.5% apply for jobs that would require them to move to a new metro\narea.\n\n(Glassdoor)\n\nCompanies that hire out of state applicants have a bigger candidate pool to\nchoose from. The findings of the 2019 Job Seeker Nation Survey suggest that\nalmost 30% of Americans looking for work wouldn\u2019t have a problem moving to a\ndifferent metro area for a good job opportunity. However, most workers feel\ndeeply rooted in their current location and send applications only to local\ncompanies.\n\n#### 53\\. 78% of employers feel they do a good job setting expectations\nupfront and communicating throughout the hiring process, while only 47% of\njob-seekers agree.\n\n(Career Builder)\n\nCareer Builder\u2019s recruitment statistics highlight a discrepancy between how\nemployers view their ability to set candidates\u2019 expectations and how\napplicants perceive this ability. While companies think they\u2019re doing a good\njob at defining the application process and sharing information with\ninterested candidates, the other side cares to disagree. Applicants often wish\nfor clearer communication and better-defined timelines. This is important to\nnote since only [36% of potential\ncandidates](https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/87/15-new-recruiting-\ntrends-you-should-implement-in-2020) are job seekers!\n\n#### 54\\. 51% of workers and job seekers say their preferred source for\nfinding a relevant new job opportunity is an online job platform.\n\n(Glassdoor)\n\nAccording to online recruitment statistics, people are trusting of websites\nthat post job ads, such as Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and Jobs.com. These websites\nare the preferred method of slightly more than half of job seekers, regardless\nof whether they currently have a job or not. Hearing about a job opportunity\nfrom a friend (45%) and finding it on a company\u2019s careers site (35%) are the\nnext-most common methods of discovering open positions.\n\n#### 55\\. Competitive benefits (48%), a convenient commute (47%), and a\nrelatively high salary (46%) are the factors that attract most job seekers.\n\n(Glassdoor)\n\nThese were the top three reasons candidates named when asked what inspires\nthem respond to a job ad. Glassdoor stats indicate that job seekers value\nbenefits and a short commute more than a generous salary, reinforcing the\nimportance of work-life balance.\n\n#### 56\\. Women are 22% more likely than men to look for work flexibility when\ndeciding whether or not to take a job.\n\n(Linkedin)\n\nSince women tend to take on more family responsibilities than men, they value\na flexible work environment more than their male colleagues. Women aged 36 to\n45 are the most likely to make flexibility a top priority when choosing a job.\n\n#### 57\\. Female candidates are 50% more likely than male candidates to give\nup on a potential job because of CEO misbehavior.\n\n(Glassdoor)\n\nHiring stats show that as many as 42% of women have encountered CEOs whose\nmisconduct has made them drop out of the application process. This happens to\nmen less often - only 21% of male candidates report having done the same.\n\n#### 58\\. 89% of job seekers agree that an employer\u2019s career website is\nimportant for finding key information.\n\n(Career Builder)\n\nWhen in search of info on a potential employer, candidates turn to the\ncompany\u2019s website. As HR statistics strongly suggest, having an informative\nand well-designed career website bodes well with candidates. Indeed, 56% of\napplicants think they can tell what it would be like to work for a company\nbased on its career site. If you manage one of these sites, make sure to\nregularly update it.\n\n#### 59\\. On average, candidates will read six company reviews before forming\nan opinion about the business.\n\n(Glassdoor)\n\nWe trust online reviews, and not only when it comes to hotels and restaurants.\nFormer employees and job seekers post reviews about employers too. And other\ncandidates trust them. Thankfully, they won\u2019t base their entire opinion on a\nsingle review, but will instead read as many as six before coming to a\nconclusion.\n\n#### 60\\. 48% of applicants say the pre-employment screening experience\naffects how favorably they view a potential employer.\n\n(Career Builder)\n\nRecruitment statistics published in Career Builder\u2019s Candidate Experience\nReport point to the significance of the manner in which companies conduct\nbackground checks. Even though most job seekers understand such checks are\nnecessary and accept them, they appreciate employers\u2019 discretion during the\nprocess.\n\n#### 61\\. Only 47% of workers trust that job descriptions accurately depict\njob responsibilities.\n\n(Jobvite)\n\nMaybe they have been assigned additional tasks too many times in the past, or\nmaybe they are just sceptical. For whatever reason, jobs stats show\napproximately 50% of employees fear their new job will entail more than was\ninitially disclosed.\n\n#### 62\\. 29% of workers admit to having left a job within the first 90 days.\n\n(Jobvite)\n\nThorough job descriptions are essential to retaining new hires. Of those who\nhave left their jobs within the first three months, 45% say they did it\nbecause the day-to-day role was not what they had expected. Honesty is the\nbest policy as it will set the right expectations among employees and\nconsequently keep your churn rate low.\n\n#### 63\\. 26% of American workers have quit a job because they were\nunsatisfied with the onboarding or training process.\n\n(iCIMS)\n\nFirst impressions matter, so do your best to properly introduce new hires to\nthe organization and train them well. This is another key takeaway from human\nresources stats published by iCIMS last year. Perhaps an even more alarming\nfact is that 44% of workers didn\u2019t quit during that period but considered\ndoing so.\n\n#### 64\\. 79% of job seekers say they use social networks in their job search.\n\n(Zety)\n\nSocial media recruitment statistics recently published by Zety confirm that\nsocial networks are effective channels for attracting talent. Some eight in 10\njob seekers turn to these platforms in their search for a new job. So, if\nyou\u2019re an employer searching for employees, post your ad on Facebook and\nInstagram in addition to career websites like Glassdoor and LinkedIn. It will\nsurely broaden your talent pool.\n\n#### 65\\. 60% of millennials say they are open to new job opportunities.\n\n(Gallup)\n\nWorkers who belong to this generation have earned a reputation for being job-\nhoppers. In fact, Gallup\u2019s recruitment statistics show that six in 10\nmillennials say they would change their job if the right opportunity presented\nitself, while 21% say they worked for a different employer a year ago.\n\n#### 66\\. 76% of job seekers state that not hearing back after submitting a\njob application trumps the frustration of not hearing back after a first date.\n\n(iCIMS)\n\nAs awful as it is to receive no news from a date, being ignored by a company\nis apparently much worse. When potential employers don\u2019t get in touch with a\ncandidate, they annoy the candidate and harm their own reputation, world\nmarket hiring stats show.\n\n### Diversity in the Workplace\n\n#### 67\\. Companies with racially and culturally diverse teams are 33% more\nlikely to achieve above-average profitability than companies with executive\nteams made up of people with the same background.\n\n(Glassdoor)\n\nPeople with different backgrounds have their own unique ways of solving\nproblems. When an executive team is made up of members from different cultural\nand racial backgrounds, its profitability goes up by 33%, as Glassdoor\u2019s\ndiversity hiring stats reveal.\n\n#### 68\\. For nearly 30 years, white applicants have been, on average,\nreceiving 36% more callbacks than black applicants with identical resumes.\n\n(Harvard Business Review)\n\nA longitudinal study carried out by scientists from Harvard University\nhighlights some disappointing results. After analyzing data from 24 field\nexperiments, which included more than 54,000 applications across 25,000\npositions, researchers published these discouraging hiring discrimination\nstatistics. Black American candidates have been suffering the same levels of\ndiscrimination for the past quarter of a century.\n\n#### 69\\. Only 25% of companies set gender diversity targets when creating\ntheir hiring strategy.\n\n(Jobbatical)\n\nTwo-thirds of employers report having a strategy in place to increase hiring\nfor underrepresented groups. However, just a quarter say they have defined\ntargets for employing an equal number of male and female workers according to\nJobbatical\u2019s gender bias in hiring statistics.\n\n#### 70\\. Hispanics and Latinos comprise 8% of all US graduates but they hold\nonly 4% of senior executive positions.\n\n(Glassdoor)\n\nThis is yet another stat that shows we have a long we to go until we as a\nnation accomplish our diverse hiring goals. The hiring rate for black\nAmericans in executive positions is even lower: 10% of all American graduates\nare black, yet this racial group comprises only 4% of senior executives in our\ncountry.\n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve curated our list of hiring stats focusing on the employer\u2019s\npoint of view. For the final portion of this piece, however, we\u2019ve decided to\nanswer some of the most common questions job seekers ask.\n\n#### Where to look for a job?\n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong if you begin your search online. If you google places that\nare currently hiring, in the top results you\u2019ll see websites like Glassdoor,\nLinkedIn, Indeed, and Snagajob. These job search platforms allow users to\nfilter tens of thousands of job posts according to their qualifications,\nlocation, job requirements, and other criteria.\n\nAsking friends and family members if there\u2019s a job opening in their companies\nis also a good idea. Statistics about job opportunities show that having a\nreferral increases your chances of landing a job.\n\n#### When do companies hire?\n\nJob seekers will be glad to learn that half of companies hire throughout the\nyear. The other half look for workers only when the need for them arises.\n\n#### How many open jobs are there in the US now?\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics\n[reports](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm) that there were 7.3\nmillion job openings on the last business day of June 2019. That\u2019s quite an\nimpressive list of hiring jobs.\n\n#### How big is the recruiting industry?\n\n[Statista\u2019s data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/873648/us-staffing-\nindustry-market-size/) shows that the staffing and recruitment industry was\nworth $148.1 billion in 2018. It is projected to grow pretty fast, reaching\n$157.8 billion next year.\n\n#### What percentage of applicants get an interview?\n\nEven in a candidates\u2019 market, the competition is tough. According to [Web\nWire\u2019s job interview\nstatistics](https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=184277#.Usw5G7GEit9),\nonly the top 2% of candidates get invited to sit down and have a conversation\nwith the recruiter.\n\n### Winning Over Top Talent\n\nWith the current talent shortage, employers are forced to up their game in\norder to attract high-quality staff. The latest recruitment statistics\nindicate that being upfront with candidates about the duration of the hiring\nprocess and remuneration enhances their experience and creates a positive\nemployer brand. Job seekers increasingly value a flexible work environment.\nThey also respond well to job posts with video content about what it\u2019s like to\nwork in a company.\n\nHopefully, you are now armed with the knowledge you need to win over the\nworkers you want on your team.\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n  1.

It begins from the moment they first encounter\nthe organisation, and continues until the day they leave.\n\n**What are the key stages of the human resources cycle?**\n\nAlso known as the employee life cycle, a well-executed human resources cycle\nensures the right people are in the right role. There is a high degree of\noverlap between the different stages of the cycle and the [overall HR\nstrategy](https://www.strategicpay.co.nz/Reward.html), and together they play\na large role in the overall employee experience. When the two are managed\neffectively, organisations see an increase in employee commitment and\nproductivity, as well as a decrease in staff turnover.\n\nThere are five core aspects to the human resources cycle.\n\n**1) Attraction, recruitment, selection**  \nAttraction starts before the organisation is even looking for a new employee.\nIt encompasses the organisation's brand, and what shapes a potential\nemployee's overall perception of the company. As well as brand marketing,\nword-of-mouth plays a large role in shaping public opinion, and acts as a\nstrong motivator or detractor.\n\nRecruiting is about building a good candidate pipeline to ensure you have the\nbest people available for each role. Success in selection is determined by\nmuch more than just the recruiter-candidate relationship, with your committed\nand loyal employees being your greatest champions.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/038/0223_637215290728643929.jpg)](/nz/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/flexible-work-from-the-new-normal-to-the-new-necessary/218904)\n\n#### [Flexible Work: from the new normal to the new\nnecessary](/nz/specialisation/employee-engagement/flexible-work-from-the-new-\nnormal-to-the-new-necessary/218904)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/038/0248_637217770659097647.jpg)](/nz/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/its-never-been-more-important-to-listen-to-employees/219018)\n\n#### ['It's never been more important to listen to\nemployees'](/nz/specialisation/employee-engagement/its-never-been-more-\nimportant-to-listen-to-employees/219018)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637213360039891507.jpg)](/nz/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218601)\n\n#### [COVID-19: HR's main challenges revealed](/nz/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218601)\n\n**2) Induction, orientation, onboarding**  \nDuring stage two, the employer and employee layout their [expectations of each\nother](https://www.strategicpay.co.nz/News/x_post/Why-a-job-description-\nshapes-a-performance-review-00162.html). As a business, it is important to\nensure the new employee feels inspired by their new role, becomes engrained in\ncompany culture and settles within their team. Employees should feel welcome,\nvalued and properly equipped to do their job right from day one.\n\nWhat companies should work to avoid, is overselling the offer. Don't make\npromises that you can't actually deliver on, as employees quickly become\ndissatisfied if they're not experiencing what they were sold.\n\n**3) Career planning and development**  \nOnce your employee is established, the focus is on providing an opportunity\nfor them to grow. A key part of this stage is how you [deal with performance\nmanagement](https://www.strategicpay.co.nz/Reward/Performance+Development.html).\nAfter each performance appraisal, you may want to reward your employees in\nrecognition of everything they've achieved, whether intrinsically or\nextrinsically. You can also offer [individual or team\nincentives](https://www.strategicpay.co.nz/News/x_post/Whats-the-best-\napproach-to-incentives-00137.html) for the new goals you set.\n\nFrom a business development perspective, you want to find ways to improve\ntalent and boost productivity and revenues. HR teams should work to understand\nand identify potential and actual specialist skills, interests and talents\nthat they have within the business, and use this information when looking for\nways to help those employees grow.\n\n**4) Retention**  \nThere's a lot of time and money invested in the cycle for each employee -\nlosing someone means that the entire process must start again. So ensuring\nthat you are able to retain talent past stage three is important.\n\nIn terms of the day-to-day, the best way to [retain good\nemployees](https://www.strategicpay.co.nz/News/x_post/Competitive-pay-\nconsiderations-00163.html) is to give them the tools, environment and skill\nset they need in order to do their job effectively. When this doesn't happen,\nemployees become frustrated and the organisation loses high-performing,\nspecialised talent.\n\n[Looking further\nahead](https://www.strategicpay.co.nz/Plus/Setting+the+Direction.html#Futureproofstrategicplanning),\norganisations must create a culture where employees feel confident that they\nknow where they're going and what their purpose is. Career pathways should be\nwell-defined with a sense of transparency.\n\n**5) Separation and termination phase**  \nFor many, this stage is simply a paper-pushing exercise that ticks HR boxes -\nbut it can be extremely valuable when executed effectively.\n\nUnderstanding why employees leave is a key part of retaining the best people\ngoing forward. Having a conversation about their choices early in the exit\nprocess also promotes a positive atmosphere, and helps to leave the door open\nfor good employees to return and ultimately continue recommending your\norganisation to others.\n\nAn early conversation also allows you to start rectifying problems quickly.\nFor example, if the reason for resignation is to do with management, it's\nlikely that other employees are also experiencing difficulties and may also\nconsider leaving the company if you don't take action quickly.\n\nOne thing organisations often neglect to manage properly is how the\nannouncement is communicated to other staff remaining on the team. Being\ntransparent and open prevents remaining staff from worrying about the future,\nand ensures they remain positive and productive.\n\nCommunicating effectively with your employees through the human resources\ncycle minimises their uncertainty around the future.\n\n**How can organisations improve their human resources cycle?**  \nWhile the overall stages of the cycle remain largely the same, how it's\nimplemented varies largely according to in-house resources and organisational\napproach. Small organisations may not have an in-house HR team to manage the\ncycle, while a large company may have a big HR department but be bound by\nbudgetary constraints.\n\nHowever, all organisations can be proactive in doing what they can to improve\ntheir existing employee life cycle and should consider:\n\n  * **Taking a holistic approach** \\- Organisations should never treat the stages of the human resources cycle in isolation. Every stage impacts an employee's relationship with the organisation.\n  * **Consistently reviewing the approach** \\- The labour market and needs of the work force are ever changing. What worked 20 years ago won't satisfy employees today, and HR teams must adapt and review their processes on a regular basis.\n  * **Part of the review is to identify problems with the approach at the various stages** - figure out what is working, what isn't and why. If you have high employee turnover, for instance, then you may need to look at each stage to pinpoint where the problem is. Potential problems within your recruitment process could be that you lose your preferred candidate right at the end stages or if you are receiving a whole lot of unsuitable applications due to problems with how you are advertising and communicating the vacancy. When something doesn't go as planned, look in detail at that stage of the cycle to understand the changes required.\n  * **Managing communication channels** \\- Poor communication methods and transparency are a large problem that organisations face. Improving how each stage and important announcements are communicated is critical to the smooth running of all HR processes.\n  * **Prioritising the onboarding process** \\- Organisations often don't place enough emphasis on integrating their employees and making them feel a part of the team. First impressions count for a lot, and ensuring that the right people are available to meet, train and welcome new employees is a step in the right direction.\n\nNot all companies may have the resources in-house to ensure their HR cycle is\nproperly designed and effectively implemented. Invest in the right support to:\n\n  * Identify what you need from each stage.\n  * Write and analyse job descriptions, job evaluation and sizing.\n  * Provide crucial benchmarking data and market insight.\n  * Develop pay-related policies, strategies and systems around remuneration and reward from the top level down.\n\nThe right partner will help you to improve or develop every stage of your\nhuman resources cycle.\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily

workers ranks as the toughest challenge HR\nfaces in the coming year, according to a new survey.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | December

leaders, sourcing and landing\nhigh-quality applicants, along with managing future healthcare (especially the\nAffordable Care Act) and diversity, are predicted to be HR\u2019s toughest\nchallenges during the coming year, according to a survey of more than 700 HR\nprofessionals.\n\nThe [survey](https://www.xperthr.com/forms/top-HR-trends-\nfor-2020-strategic/?DMDcode=HUXXC&fcid=%7b5f331420-ea59-4cab-a989-1f0b8bfeb5a8%7d_FC0218_XHR_201912_Top_HR_Trends_for_2020&fcfileext=pdf&title=Top%20HR%20Trends%20for%202020&cmpid=PRL|USAG|HUGMN-2019-2019-Press_Releases&sfid=7014J000000Q0Aw),\nXpertHR\u2019s fourth annual, reports that nearly 30% of respondents named\nrecruiting and hiring as their most critical challenge. Most of all, of those\nwho reported recruiting and hiring needs, 51% are \u201cextremely challenged\u201d in\nfinding high-quality candidates\u2014more than twice the number (22%) from just two\nyears ago.\n\n\u201cFinding skilled, qualified applicants is a struggle for many,\u201d says Beth\nZoller, JD, legal editor at XpertHR. She adds that building a culture where\nemployees want to work; seeking out untapped job markets such as [older\nemployees](https://hrexecutive.com/why-older-workers-are-now-in-demand/),\n[veterans](https://hrexecutive.com/partnership-aims-to-help-vets-succeed-in-\ntheir-next-mission/) and[ those with criminal\nconvictions](https://hrexecutive.com/how-companies-are-putting-ex-offenders-\nback-to-work/); and taking advantage of non-traditional candidates (for\ninstance, gig workers, remote workers and job shares) might be a few\nsolutions.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n\u201cThese are all tactics that employers can implement in order to meet their\ntalent-acquisition needs,\u201d Zoller says.\n\nAs for healthcare, 50% of respondents are feeling [\u201cextremely challenged\u201d by\ncosts](https://hrexecutive.com/study-americans-are-agonizing-over-healthcare-\ncosts/), while 27% are extremely challenged when it comes to preparing for the\nfuture of healthcare and the ACA. In fact, compared with prior years, concern\nover the future of healthcare and the ACA has grown considerably\u2014only 17%\nfound this a top concern in 2017.\n\n**Related:[These were the top 5 benefits trends of\n2019](https://hrexecutive.com/kathryn-mayer-top-5-benefit-trends-of-2019/)**\n\n\u201cIn addition to the rising cost of benefits, employers must address the needs\nof different generations and provide benefits that each group finds useful,\u201d\nZoller explains. For example, she says,[ older\nworkers](https://hrexecutive.com/how-to-keep-baby-boomer-workers-happy/) may\nbe more interested in long-term disability, while younger workers may want\nbenefits such as [daycare](https://hrexecutive.com/bring-your-baby-to-work-no-\nreally/) and gym memberships.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s employers need to strike a balance and determine which benefits are\nmost valuable and attractive to their workforce,\u201d Zoller says.\n\nNext up on the difficulty scale is diversity and inclusion. Zoller says this\nissue today goes beyond race, sex, ethnicity, age, national origin and\nreligion, and includes differing work experiences, sexual orientation,\neducational status, marital status, socioeconomic status, physical\ncharacteristics, life experiences, background and upbringing. XpertHR\u2019s survey\nfound that 38% of respondents reported managing diversity to be extremely\nchallenging.\n\n**See also:[How the world's most admired companies drive diversity and\ninclusion](https://hrexecutive.com/how-the-worlds-most-admired-companies-\ndrive-diversity-and-inclusion/)**\n\nZoller believes it's incumbent upon HR to lead the way and incorporate\ndiversity into the organization, with the goal of creating an inclusive and\ntolerant workplace.\n\n\u201cDiversity efforts start at the top with the buy-in of key stakeholders and\nupper management who can see the value diversity can bring,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\nmust be tied to business goals and aligned with corporate strategies.\u201d\n\nOther strategic HR concerns survey respondents characterized as \u201cextremely\nchallenging\u201d include employee engagement, morale and satisfaction (34%),\nemployee retention (31%) and managing work/life balance (20%).\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

entire interview process to ensure a positive\nexperience for all candidates.\n\nBy: [Jacqui Maguire](https://hrexecutive.com/author/jacqui-maguire/ \"Posts by\nJacqui Maguire\") | October 31, 2019

organization is only as strong as its people. With that concept as a\nguiding principle, hiring should be an [intentional and strategic\nprocess](https://hrexecutive.com/heres-how-top-employers-are-revamping-their-\nhiring-strategies/). But [making the right hire](https://hrexecutive.com/new-\nsurvey-finds-recruiters-are-getting-creative/) can\u2019t be the only goal of a\nrecruiter. If you want your business to be able to attract exceptional talent\nwho are well-suited for their roles, your recruiters also have to own every\nmoment of the interview process to ensure all candidates have a positive\nexperience\u2014even if they aren\u2019t offered the position.\n\nWhy? Candidates share their experiences with friends, colleagues and strangers\nthrough public platforms. A poor candidate experience can adversely affect an\norganization over time, both through reputational damage and the missed\nopportunity of having the right person in the right role when your ideal\ncandidate declines your offer.\n\n**Taking a Reputation Hit**\n\nA poor candidate experience can easily send people rushing to share their\nstories about a company on employer-review sites and social media networks.\n[According to CareerArc](https://www.bullhorn.com/blog/2017/04/bad-candidate-\nbad-experience/), 72% of job seekers have reported sharing bad candidate\nexperiences on sites like Glassdoor, on social media or directly with a\ncolleague or friend.\n\n**Related:[Here's the latest _North American Candidate Experience\nReport._](https://hrexecutive.com/heres-the-latest-north-american-candidate-\nexperience-report/)**\n\nThe interview process is also an important time for companies to introduce\ncandidates to how they operate behind the scenes and leave a positive\nimpression about the organization as a whole. However, statistics paint an\nentirely different picture about what\u2019s actually happening, as [46% of job\ncandidates](https://www.jibe.com/blog/how-a-horrible-candidate-experience-\nhurts-your-brand/) in North America cited a lack of response from hiring\nmanagers for at least two months after applying for a job. When talent teams\noverlook simple things like periodic touch points or even a prompt rejection\nnote, it can reflect negatively on the employer and adversely affect a\ncompany\u2019s reputation, discourage potential new job seekers and even distance\nthat company\u2019s customers over time.\n\n**Poor Experiences Cost Money**\n\nBad candidate experiences can limit a company\u2019s future talent pool and end up\ncosting more time and money down the line. In fact, a [LinkedIn\nsurvey](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/2013/12/are-\ncandidates-customers-or-something-\nmore?source=post_page---------------------------) found 27% of candidates who\nhad a negative experience would \u201cactively discourage\u201d others from applying for\na job with that company. This means that more than a quarter of job seekers\nwho had less than stellar candidate experiences could actively be hurting that\ncompany\u2019s recruiting efforts. Over time, this means it gets harder to attract\ncandidates (especially when hiring for similar roles), forcing that business\nto turn to less qualified applicants to fill empty job roles because the most\ndesirable candidates are no longer interested in working there.\n\n**See also:[What do today's job candidates really want?\n](https://hrexecutive.com/what-do-todays-candidates-really-want/)**\n\nAlso, the brand damage created during a bad hiring process can hurt brand\nperception, and by extension, sales and revenue. For example, [41% of\napplicants with a poor candidate experience ditch brand\nloyalty](https://www.wayup.com/guide/community/how-a-positive-candidate-\nexperience-affects-company-revenue/) and avoid buying that company\u2019s products.\n\n**What Should HR Teams and Hiring Managers Do?**\n\nIf a poor hiring experience can cost businesses money, talent, time and even\nconsumer goodwill, what do hiring managers and recruiters need to know to get\nahead of the problem?\n\n  1. **Structure your interview process.** A structured process is the most efficient and effective way to conduct interviews. Each interview has a specific purpose and questions don\u2019t overlap\u2014ensuring you gather the information you need to make a decision. Also, hiring managers are only having as many interviews as they need, and candidates don\u2019t have to repeat themselves.\n\n  2. **Communication is key.** Candidates should feel like they\u2019re dealing with a confident and informative organization. From job descriptions and online applications to interviews up to the final job offer, candidates should consistently be informed throughout the hiring journey and know what to expect next. [Even a notification](https://hrexecutive.com/4-simple-reasons-why-texting-can-lead-to-better-hires/) alerting a candidate that his or her resume has been received goes a long way.\n\n  3. **Align the experience with company values.** Introduce candidates to more than just the hiring manager. Seeing a broader picture of the company is highly valuable for a candidate because the reality is that they\u2019re joining the whole company, not just the manager. Proactively introducing candidates to cross-functional partners, members of ERGs, culture clubs, affinity groups and even C-suites when appropriate can not only showcase your company\u2019s values in action, but create a personal experience that stands out within a candidate\u2019s recruiting journey.\n\n  4. **Be honest and timely about saying \u2018no.\u2019** There\u2019s nothing worse for a candidate than to go through an organization\u2019s entire recruiting process and have to wait for the hiring decision that never comes. Hiring managers or recruiters should be prompt and honest when sending a rejection letter (i.e. as soon as they decide not to move forward with a candidate). It\u2019s surprising how appreciative candidates are when it comes to this gesture\u2014many will reply with a \u201cthank you\u201d\u2014as it gives them the closure they\u2019re seeking.\n\nThere\u2019s no secret formula to a successful candidate experience, but with some\nintention, the benefits speak for themselves. An integrated approach to the\ncandidate journey can improve an organization\u2019s brand, attract better-quality\nhires and increase ROI.\n\n_Jacqui Maguire is director of talent acquisition at Greenhouse._\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fthe-\ntrue-business-cost-of-a-poor-candidate-experience%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The+true+business+cost+of+a+poor+candidate+experience&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fthe-\ntrue-business-cost-of-a-poor-candidate-experience%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fthe-\ntrue-business-cost-of-a-poor-candidate-experience%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

longer, \u201cWe have a job, so let's fill it.\u201d\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | December 19, 2019 \u2022 6 min read\n\nTopics:

to talent mining, the game has changed.\n\nThe hiring concept is no longer \u201cWe have a job, so let's fill it.\u201d Instead,\nhiring/talent acquisition\u2014whether from within or via external pipelines\u2014is a\ncontinuous proposition.\n\n\u201cThe amount of time and resources that go into identifying, screening,\ninterviewing and hiring a new employee is significant,\u201d says Ashutosh Garg,\nCEO and co-founder of [Eightfold.ai](https://eightfold.ai), a \u201ctalent\nintelligence\u201d platform provider in Mountain View, Calif. \u201cCompanies are\nfinding that the expense and time required to hire an employee is rising each\nquarter, while each employee is likely to quit the job in an ever-shorter\nperiod of time.\u201d\n\nTo counteract these challenges in a highly competitive talent market, Garg\nsays, employers must think harder about how to create competitive advantages\nfor their own talent processes, so that they can begin to bend the cost and\ntime-to-hire curves backward.\n\n\u201cSimply doing more of the same tactics will not create different results,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n**Related:[Here's what your peers are doing to strengthen talent acquisition\n](https://hrexecutive.com/want-to-know-what-your-peers-are-doing-to-\nstrengthen-talent-acquisition/)**\n\nThe folks at Bank of America are keenly aware that the old ways no longer\nwork, according to Christie Gragnani-Woods, the company\u2019s head of talent\nacquisition for consumer and small business and wealth management. In the\nrecent past, the company has begun programs to adjust to today's talent\nrealities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\u201cJob candidates with strong skill sets are in high demand and unemployment is\nlow, meaning employees have more choices today,\u201d Gragnani-Woods says. \u201cThat\u2019s\nwhy we\u2019re focused on being a great place to work and investing in our people.\u201d\n\nBoA, based in Charlotte, N.C., created [The Academy at Bank of\nAmerica](https://careers.bankofamerica.com/en-us/join-us/career-\ndevelopment/the-academy), an employee-development organization charged with\nonboarding and skill development of the 100,000 or so employees across its\nconsumer, small business, Merrill and private banking segments.\n\nJohn Jordan, the BoA managing director who heads the effort, says that, in\nterms of a talent pipeline, the BoA Academy has significantly increased\ninternal hiring and average tenure.\n\n\u201cWe recognize how important it is for our employees to develop and progress in\ntheir careers,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo we offer learning and development programs\nthat ensure all teammates have access to the resources they need to advance\ntheir careers with us.\u201d This includes a Career Path Tool that helps teammates\nvisualize and explore career paths and future roles, as well as the steps\nneeded to get there.\n\n**See also:[These are the skills recruiters of tomorrow will\nneed](https://hrexecutive.com/these-are-the-skills-recruiters-of-tomorrow-\nwill-need/)**\n\nThe Academy supports the career development of more than 66,000 consumer and\nsmall business teammates, as BoA dubs it employees. It currently offers 65\ndifferent programs across four levels of programming\u2014new-to-role, in-role\ndevelopment, mastery and leadership development. The Academy has supported\nmore 27,000 career advancements within the last three years, according to\nJordan.\n\nAdditionally, in 2018, BoA launched its Pathways Program, a five-year\ncommitment to hire 10,000 people from low- to moderate-income communities into\nroles within consumer and small business. BoA HR leaders say the program\nprovides a sustainable source of talent for jobs in high demand.\n\n\u201cThrough our Pathways career program, we partner with external organizations\nto help connect us to candidates with strong potential,\u201d Gragnani-Woods says.\n\u201cThis investment in nonprofit partners\u2019 workforce-development programs builds\nskills among qualified candidates and prepares them for careers in the\nfinancial-services industry.\u201d\n\nAnother example of meeting continuous talent needs is BoA\u2019s six-month-old\nYear-Up Intern Program, which is offered twice a year to low- and moderate-\nincome adults and focuses on skills development with the potential for\nparticipants to become full-time employees at Bank of America.\n\n\u201cNot only are we finding talented interns through the program, we\u2019re also\ngetting referrals from our nonprofit partners,\u201d she says. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve\ngotten nearly 900 referrals and we\u2019re continuing to work with our partners to\nfind more great talent.\u201d\n\nGragnani-Woods says BoA is seeing company-wide results from its efforts.\n\n\u201cPathways not only provides a sustainable source of talent for jobs in high\ndemand, it also helps Bank of America represent the diverse communities we\nserve and creates a pipeline of diverse talent,\u201d she says, noting that, to\ndate, BoA has already made more than 7,600 Pathways hires, 76% of its 2022\ngoal.\n\n**Savers Looks to Build Brand, Keep Turnover Low**\n\nSavers, a for-profit, global thrift retailer, headquartered in Bellevue,\nWash., offers high-quality, gently used clothing, accessories and household\ngoods. Today, it works with San Mateo, Calif.-based Jobvite, a recruiting\nsolution, to meet its continuous talent-mining challenges\u2014from recruitment\nmarketing to enhancing the hiring experience to new-hire engagement.\n\nAccording to Lea Bedford, people services center manager at\n[Savers](https://jobs.jobvite.com/savers), Jobvite helps her company engage\ncandidates with meaningful experiences \u201cat the right time, in the right way,\nfrom first look to first day.\u201d In its work with Savers, Jobvite infuses\nautomation and intelligence into the current expanded recruiting cycle to\nincrease the speed, quality and cost-effectiveness of talent acquisition, she\nsays.\n\nWithin a week of launching Jobvite, in fact, Savers received around 25,000\napplicants, allowing the company to take its pick of top talent. Also, Savers\nhas seen a serious impact on its applicant pool, enabling Jobvite to do the\nheavy lifting while empowering its employees to focus on the task at hand.\n\n\u201cEmployment branding is more important than ever,\u201d Bedford notes. \u201cIn previous\nmarkets, pay was the key factor\u2014today\u2019s workers aren\u2019t looking for just pay,\nbut also a holistic employment experience that values their contribution on a\npersonal and professional level.\u201d\n\nShe says this means more work-life-balance conversations, a focus on\ninnovative cultures and, with that, a lower risk of turnover.\n\n\u201cIf employees do not feel your company meets these values, they will leave\u2014and\nthe time and expense of replacing them hurts,\u201d she says, adding that employers\nneed to be thoughtful and thorough with their interview questions.\n\n\u201cCompetency is always important but cultural fit has achieved nearly the same\nlevel of importance,\u201d she says, noting that opportunities to differentiate\nthrough creative fringe benefits, workplace-environment factors and a flexible\nwork schedule are more abundant than before. But, she notes, to take advantage\nof those opportunities, it\u2019s essential to stay connected to the market changes\nand the thoughts and feelings of the workforce.\n\n\u201cWe continuously work to define and socialize our employment brand and also\ndeploy a high level of employee-engagement study and analysis to learn what we\nwant, what we need and how we can meet the needs and desires of our target\nemployee,\u201d Bedford says.\n\nScott Jensen, director of the Department of Labor and Training for the state\nof Rhode Island, manages the state\u2019s [Real Jobs Rhode\nIsland](http://www.dlt.ri.gov/realjobs/) program, which offers workforce-\ndevelopment strategy to employers. Primarily, Real Jobs Rhode Island convenes\nemployers and actively listens to the workforce/talent challenges they're\nexperiencing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nNext, with the employers in the lead, Real Jobs Rhode Island offers, among\nother strategies, its expertise about how to manage a relationship with a\ncommunity college, for example, or how to stitch together an effective hiring\nstrategy, or how a nonprofit organization can reach more deeply into a\ncommunity to build talent pipelines, Jensen says.\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing more and more is just disruption in the economy,\u201d he\nexplains. \u201cThat means it is really less about what hard specific skills are\nneeded to fill a predetermined role, and more about a fit of personality and\nmission and interest that aligns with an employer.\n\n\u201cThis way,\u201d he adds, \u201cthe person eventually hired is going to add value and be\nmore of a long-term hire; it looks much more like a conversation than old-\nfashioned recruitment.\u201d\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nMarilyn Tyfting\n\nCCO at [TELUS International](https://www.telusinternational.com/), a global\ncustomer experience provider powered by next-gen digital solutions.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\n\u200bThe traditional recruitment process hasn't become irrelevant, but it\ncertainly has earned some innovative and dynamic competition from tech-driven,\nmobile-first solutions. Brands looking to attract tech-savvy, digital-native\ntalent from Gens Y (millennials) and Z (iGen) need to meet that talent on the\nplatforms and in the digital spaces where they spend their time.\n\nMany companies have done a great job of adapting their approach to\n[integrating technology at work](http://www.hrotoday.com/news/engaged-\nworkforce/thoughtful-design/), in workspaces and other systems and processes\nto better support mobile- and tech-first modern employees. But too often,\ntheir experience is like building a brand new library, complete with shiny new\nshelves. There's just one problem: They still need to fill those shelves with\nbooks, or whatever people are reading these days.\n\nIn other words, even if your company has become a desired workplace for\nmembers of Gen Y and Z, your employer brand needs to encompass more than your\nworkplace if you hope to attract the right candidates. That starts with the\nrecruitment process. Since technology continues to change at a mind-numbing\nrate, more and more brands are seeking help from recruitment specialists,\noutside firms performing a function broadly known as recruitment process\noutsourcing (RPO). Alongside other tech-driven outsourcing functions, RPO has\nmaintained one of the highest growth rates over the past several years at over\n[15%](https://www2.everestgrp.com/reportaction/EGR-2018-26-R-2722/Marketing)\nper year.\n\nRPO is helping organizations stand out in a highly competitive labor market\nand attract the right candidates who fit the technical requirements of the\nroles but also fit the culture or the organization in the following ways.\n\n**1\\. Using Tech Reduces Effort For Both Applicants And Recruiters**\n\nIn the world of outsourcing, chatbots are mostly known for using AI to provide\nthe first layer for customer support. They're great at answering basic\nquestions and providing information, following scripts to deflect otherwise\ntedious human interactions.\n\nThat same rationale holds true in the recruiting world: Automation can now\ntake some of the copious manual activities off of human recruiters' plates.\nAutomated tools can now source candidates, administer assessments, schedule\ninterviews and provide regular updates to candidates throughout the process.\nIt's a great way to use AI to reduce effort on both sides of the [recruitment\nequation](https://www.inc.com/bryan-adams/why-chatbots-will-be-future-of-\nrecruiting.html).\n\nAnother great application of advanced technology involves the social media\nplatform Snapchat. In Canada, McDonald's was the first brand to launch\n\"'[Snapplications](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/a-canadian-first-\napply-for-a-job-at-mcdonald-s-with-snapplications--862148981.html)', a one-day\nvirtual hiring event\" that allowed job seekers to instantly apply for jobs at\nMcDonald's directly through the Snapchat app.\n\n**2\\. Technology Can Enhance Employer Branding**\n\nIf your company is hiring through a social network, it's critical to know that\nyour desired applicant pool is stocked with active users of the platform.\nSimilarly, if you're a tech-driven company that relies on innovation, you need\nto attract candidates that live and breathe tech.\n\nEven if only a fraction of your actual applicants are users of a specific\nnetwork, using smart, fresh recruitment techniques can build buzz that results\nin a higher volume of candidates. If that volume of candidates includes a\nlarge cross-section of best-fit candidates who aspire to work for your brand,\nthen chances are good that they will [remain engaged over the long\nterm](https://www.sbnonline.com/article/five-keys-engage-team-top-line-\ngrowth/), building your top line. When they don't, [the\ncosts](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-\nrelations/pages/cost-of-bad-hires.aspx) can be astronomical.\n\n**Partnering For RPO Expertise**\n\nWhen your company's long-term health and success depends on sourcing top\ntalent, sometimes it pays to get help in that process. The right RPO partner\ncan introduce new technologies and recruiting techniques like hosting and\nimplementing bots and other AI-driven solutions. They can also help you access\nnew talent markets domestically, internationally and everywhere in between.\nPerhaps the best reason to partner is strategic. The right RPO partner will\nbring enough experience and expertise to act as a strategic consultant to\nbuild better HR and talent-driven strategies to help you meet KPIs through big\ndata and advanced analytical techniques.\n\nIn the end, it's all about reducing costs by shortening the average time to\nfill while increasing candidate quality and cultural fit, which results in\nhigher engagement and lower attrition. These outcomes won't ever come from\ntechnology alone. Tech tools must always support and enhance humans in order\nto positively impact the candidate experience, or else they risk damaging the\nemployer brand you've worked so hard to create.\n\nWhen you enlist the right partner and engage the right tech-driven strategy,\nyou can reap a triple reward: build your employer brand, reduce costs and\nimprove the long-term quality of your workforce.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Marilyn Tyfting](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2019/07/marilyntyfting_avatar_1563980579.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/marilyntyfting/\n\"Photo of Marilyn Tyfting\")\n\n[Marilyn\nTyfting](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/marilyntyfting/)\n\nCCO at [TELUS International](https://www.telusinternational.com/), a global\ncustomer experience provider powered by next-gen digital solutions.

A succinct couple of sentences relevant to the particular job is much\nmore effective,\u201d says Joss Godbold, regional director of recruitment firm Page\nExecutive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read hundreds of cover letters and almost every person writes the same\nthing: \u2018proactive\u2019, \u2018team player\u2019, \u2018conscientious\u2019,\u201d observes Godbold.\n\n\u201cIt may be the first thing you see but the cover letter is becoming less\nrelevant,\u201d he adds.\n\n**Spelling matters**\n\nWhile the significance of spelling grammar varies somewhat, a sloppy CV will\nland in the \u2018no\u2019 pile of many recruiters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a minor point, but in a market where most of my colleagues are receiving\nat least 100 applications for any role, the little things can make a big\ndifference,\u201d explains Godbold.\n\nHe estimates that up to 10% of CVs that he sees on his desk contain spelling\nmistakes.\n\n\u201cOften the mistake is right next to a statement talking about how strong they\nare on attention to detail,\u201d he adds.\n\n**Do qualifications really matter?**\n\nIf the recruiter is screening for technical and professional positions, then\nthe answer is clearly yes.\n\nBut seasoned recruiters also point out that in many cases its best not to be\ntoo rigid about the selection criteria. It could be a costly mistake to\noverlook someone for a particular role just because they don\u2019t have a tertiary\nqualification.\n\n\u201cBe careful about writing off someone based on particular selection criteria.\nYou might be missing out on a gem,\u201d she says.\n\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates, for example, became the world\u2019s richest college\ndrop-out when he drove the success of his IT company to the very top \u2013 without\na degree.\n\n**Does the timeline make sense?**\n\nThe timeline in a CV \u2013 the so-called narrative \u2013 of someone\u2019s working life can\nreveal a story about a candidate, Godbold observes.\n\nDuring the interview, if there are a lot of jumps in a CV with significant\ngaps between roles, he asks the candidate to elaborate on the reasons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always going to be difficult for a candidate to hide that and they need\nto have reasons why. If they\u2019ve had four roles in the last three years, that\u2019s\nnot good. But if they\u2019re all contract roles, it starts to make a bit more\nsense.\u201d Godbold says.\n\n**Just how important is the CV anyway?**\n\n\u201cFifteen years ago, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was 90% of the process \u2013 now it's 30-50% of the\nprocess,\u201d says Godbold.\n\n\u201cFor example, the way an online profile looks is important, including the\nquality of the profile photo.\u201d\n\nSocial media has become an important part of the screening process.\n\nIt\u2019s always worth taking a look at the candidate\u2019s Instagram and Facebook\npages. And also a quick Google search of at the screening stage is also a must\n\u2013 to unearth any potential nasty surprises.\n\n_Parts of this article were first published on the[seek\nwebsite](https://www.seek.com.au/)._\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

Why?  It\nhelps target the right candidates and speeds up the process mostly through the\nuse of artificial intelligence.\n\nAnd there's data to prove this.\n\nFor the last two years as part of our [HR Tech Global\nreport](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-tech/reports/hr-tech-global-\nreport-2019), we've asked HR professionals how their company was using\nartificial intelligence.  In both 2017 and 2018, 25% or more said they used it\nas part of their recruitment efforts.\n\n![recruitment\ntechnology](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/ai_recruitment.jpg)\n\nWith that said, what are some of the things HR needs to know about smart\nrecruiting technology?\n\n# **Recruitment Technology**\n\n### **Faster Screening**\n\nFor HR professionals the most time consuming part of the screening process is\ngoing through applications.  Smart recruitment technology can speed that up.\n\nIBM, GE and Hilton Worldwide are among the growing number of companies using\nthis technology to screen, test and hire new talent.  All of them are using\nmachines to scan candidates' work samples, social media posts, and analyze\ntheir faces faces.  One example of this:  Unilever.  For more than a year now,\nthe company as used AI to hire all of its entry-level employees. Each\ncandidated was asked to play a neuroscience-based game which measured inherent\ntraits,  Then, each had recorded interviews analyzed by Artificial\nIntelligence. Candidates where then rated through AI using thousands of data\npoints from video interviews.  Some of those included vocal intonation, word\nchoice and even facial movements.  It's been so successfuly, Unilver VP of\nHuman Resources North America Mike Clementi says the company has been\nexperimenting with using a similar process for mid-career hires or lateral\ninternal changes.\n\n### **Fairness**\n\nAs a whole, HR is seeing a huge push to remove bias from hiring practices.\nSmart recruitment technology can help level the playing field.  How?\nSpecifically, it can look for ways to better job posts and descriptions.  It\ncan also help create questionnaires that are not bias and can help alleviate\nthe same issue with regards to screening.\n\nNow, a warning.\n\nThis technology can overcome human prejudices, but it may develop its own\nbiases based on favorable traits or conditions it previously encountered. This\nis why the quality of data is so important.  Simply, if an AI system is fed\n\"good\" data, the user will see a better result.  If the system is fed \"bad\"\ndata, expect a bad result. That's a concern when inaccuracy in an AI report,\nfor instance, labels a candidate or employee as a poor performer.  This can\nhave disastrous consequences for that person's career.\n\n### **Remote Hiring**\n\nAs we've written before, the [freelance market or gig\neconomy](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-tech/news/hr-shared-services-\nand-the-future-of-work) is growing and doesn't appear to be showing any signs\nof slowing down.  That said HR as a whole does not have the expertise needed\nto hire these types of workers as it is somewhat new to the space.  In time,\nthat will change but until them smart recruitment technology can help in that\nit can identify traits and parameters needed for a particular type of remote\nworker.  It can look through an applicant's previous job history and work\nsamples to see if the person is a fit for the remote position offered by your\ncompany.\n\n### Post-interview analysis\n\nThe great thing about artificial intelligence is that it is constantly\nlearning.  As more and more interviews are conducted and completed, AI-powered\nrecruitment technology can streamline the interview process and create a\nstronger, better methodology.\n\n## Beyond Recruitment Technology\n\nWe've looked at several different ways in which recruitment technology can\nincrease the effectiveness of the recruitment process, but there are other\nareas where AI can help once the employee is brought into the company.\n\nAI-assisted onboarding, for instance, can provide real-time feedback to\nemployees through chat bots.  It can also help automate the experience in\ncollecting I-9s, W-4s, employment agreements and work eligibility information\nfrom new hires.  It can also help with training.  AI can track training and\ndevelopment and can even customize training for employees based on their\ncurrent knowledge.\n\nIf one thing is for certain, AI is not only powering recruitment technology\ntrends, it is quickly becoming a part of every HR tool available.  Aligning\nthe technologies to the company's goals will benefit the customers, employees,\nand organization, but it will never fully replace the need for a human HR team\nor department.\n\n> [Next:

Often trained on data collected about previous or similar applicants,\nthese tools can cut down on the effort recruiters need to expend in order to\nmake a hire. Last year, 67 percent of hiring managers and recruiters\n[surveyed](https://news.linkedin.com/2018/1/global-recruiting-trends-2018) by\nLinkedIn said AI was saving them time.\n\nBut critics argue that such systems can introduce bias, lack accountability\nand transparency, and aren\u2019t guaranteed to be accurate. Take, for instance,\nthe Utah-based company HireVue, which sells a [job interview video\nplatform](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/22/ai-hiring-face-\nscanning-algorithm-increasingly-decides-whether-you-deserve-job/) that can use\nartificial intelligence to assess candidates and, it claims, predict their\nlikelihood to succeed in a position. The company says it uses on-staff\npsychologists to help develop customized assessment algorithms that reflect\nthe ideal traits for a particular role a client (usually a company) hopes to\nhire for, like a sales representative or computer engineer.\n\n![Facial recognition boxes and dots cover the photo of a blond\nman.](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/Zl3Ub85q8R-6eyM1kw8Fdh4oSXE=/0x0:5000x3334/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:5000x3334\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19484592/GettyImages_1189384731.jpg) Output\nof an Artificial Intelligence system from Google Vision, performing facial\nrecognition on a photograph of a man in San Ramon, California on November 22,\n2019. Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images\n\nThat algorithm is then used to analyze how individual candidates answer\npreselected questions in a recorded video interview, grading their verbal\nresponses and, in some cases, facial movements. HireVue claims the tool \u2014\nwhich is used by about 100 clients, including\n[Hilton](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/464889/Hilton%20Aug%202017/2017_12_SuccessStory_Hilton_CustomerMarketing3.pdf?__hstc=&__hssc=&hsCtaTracking=b76cefe9-cece-4631-bef5-53084aa900e5%7Ca26c5bca-5fbe-46e3-b0e4-c1f79894f72c)\nand [Unilever](https://www.hirevue.com/customers/global-talent-acquisition-\nunilever-case-study) \u2014 is more predictive of job performance than human\ninterviewers conducting the same structured interviews.\n\nBut last month, lawyers at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a\nprivacy rights nonprofit, filed a\n[complaint](https://epic.org/privacy/ftc/hirevue/EPIC_FTC_HireVue_Complaint.pdf)\nwith the Federal Trade Commission, pushing the agency to investigate the\ncompany for potential bias, inaccuracy, and lack of transparency. It also\naccused HireVue of engaging in \u201cdeceptive trade practices\u201d because the company\nclaims it doesn\u2019t use facial recognition. (EPIC argues HireVue\u2019s facial\nanalysis qualifies as facial recognition.)\n\nThe lawsuit follows the introduction of the [Algorithmic Accountability\nAct](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Algorithmic%20Accountability%20Act%20of%202019%20Bill%20Text.pdf)\nin Congress earlier this year, which would grant the FTC authority to create\nregulations to check so-called \u201cautomated decision systems\u201d for bias.\nMeanwhile, the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC) \u2014 the federal\nagency that deals with employment discrimination \u2014 is reportedly now\ninvestigating at least two discrimination cases involving job decision\nalgorithms, according to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-\nlabor-report/punching-in-workplace-bias-police-look-at-hiring-algorithms).\n\n### AI can pop up throughout the recruitment and hiring process\n\nRecruiters can make use of artificial intelligence throughout the hiring\nprocess, from advertising and attracting potential applicants to predicting\ncandidates\u2019 job performance. \u201cJust like with the rest of the world\u2019s digital\nadvertisement, AI is helping target who sees what job descriptions [and] who\nsees what job marketing,\u201d explains Aaron Rieke, a managing director at\n[Upturn](https://www.upturn.org/reports/2018/hiring-algorithms/), a DC-based\nnonprofit digital technology research group.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just a few outlier companies, like HireVue, that use predictive\nAI. Vox\u2019s own HR staff use\n[LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/04/ai-behind-linkedin-\nrecruiter-search-and-recommendation-systems) Recruiter, a popular tool that\nuses artificial intelligence to rank candidates. **** Similarly, the jobs\nplatform ZipRecruiter uses AI to match candidates with nearby jobs that are\npotentially good fits, based on the traits the applicants have shared with the\nplatform \u2014 like their listed skills, experience, and location \u2014 and previous\ninteractions between similar candidates and prospective employers. For\ninstance, because I applied for a few San Francisco-based tutoring gigs on\nZipRecruiter last year, I\u2019ve continued to receive emails from the platform\nadvertising similar jobs in the area.\n\n### Join the Open Sourced Reporting Network\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WtR44_5nNvKREIyWx-\nsozMpsfEE=/0x0:1800x1013/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:1800x1013\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19444607/call_out_post_art_1.jpg) Christina\nAnimashaun/Vox\n\nOpen Sourced is Recode by Vox\u2019s year-long reporting project to demystify the\nworld of data, personal privacy, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. And\nwe need your help. [Fill out this form to contribute to our\nreporting](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/9/20970994/open-sourced-\nreporting-network).\n\nOverall, the company says its AI has trained on more than 1.5 billion\nemployer-candidate interactions.\n\nPlatforms like Arya \u2014 which says it\u2019s been used by Home Depot and Dyson \u2014 go\neven further, using machine learning to find candidates based on data that\nmight be available on a company\u2019s internal database, public job boards, social\nplatforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, and other profiles available on the open\nweb, like those on professional membership sites.\n\nArya claims it\u2019s even able to predict whether an employee is likely to leave\ntheir old job and take a new one, based on the data it collects about a\ncandidate, such as their promotions, movement between previous roles and\nindustries, and the predicted fit of a new position, as well as data about the\nrole and industry more broadly.\n\nAnother use of AI is to screen through application materials, like r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and\nassessments, in order to recommend which candidates recruiters should contact\nfirst. Somen Mondal, the CEO and co-founder of one such screening and matching\nservice, Ideal, says these systems do more than automatically search r\u00e9sum\u00e9s\nfor relevant keywords.\n\nFor instance, Ideal can learn to understand and compare experiences across\ncandidates\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and then rank the applicants by how closely they match an\nopening. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a recruiter Googling a company [listed on an\napplication] and learning about it,\u201d explains Mondal, who says his platform is\nused to screen 5 million candidates a month.\n\nBut AI doesn\u2019t just operate behind the scenes. If you\u2019ve ever applied for a\njob and then been engaged by a text conversation, there\u2019s a chance you\u2019re\ntalking to a recruitment bot **.** Chatbots that use natural-language\nunderstanding created by [companies like Mya](https://www.mya.com/) can help\nautomate the process of reaching out to previous applicants about a new\nopening at a company, or finding out whether an applicant meets a position\u2019s\nbasic requirements \u2014 like availability \u2014 thus eliminating the need for human\nphone-screening interviews. Mya, for instance, can reach out over text and\nemail, as well as through messaging applications like Facebook and WhatsApp.\n\nAnother burgeoning use of artificial intelligence in job selection is talent\nand personality assessments. One company championing this application is\nPymetrics, which sells neuroscience computer games for candidates to play (one\nsuch game involves [hitting the\nspacebar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzSlmZZQZgQ) whenever a red circle,\nbut not a green circle, flashes on the screen).\n\nThese games are meant to predict candidates\u2019 \u201ccognitive and personality\ntraits.\u201d Pymetrics says on its website that the system studies \u201cmillions of\ndata points\u201d collected from the games to match applicants to jobs judged to be\na good fit, based on Pymetrics\u2019 predictive algorithms.\n\n### Proponents say AI systems are faster and can consider information human\nrecruiters can\u2019t calculate quickly\n\nThese tools help HR departments move more quickly through large pools of\napplicants and ultimately make it cheaper to hire. Proponents say they can be\nmore fair and more thorough than overworked human recruiters skimming through\nhundreds of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters. ****\n\n\u201cCompanies just can\u2019t get through the applications. And if they do, they\u2019re\nspending \u2014 on average \u2014 three seconds,\u201d Mondal says. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole problem\nwith efficiency.\u201d He argues that using an AI system can ensure that every\nr\u00e9sum\u00e9, at the very least, is screened. After all, one job posting might\nattract thousands of applications, with a huge share from people who are\ncompletely unqualified for a role.\n\nSuch tools can automatically recognize traits in the application materials\nfrom previous successful hires and look for signs of that trait among\nmaterials submitted by new applicants. Mondal says systems like Ideal can\nconsider between 16 and 25 factors (or elements) in each application, pointing\nout that, unlike humans, it can calculate something like commute distance in\n\u201cmilliseconds.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can start to fine-tune the system with not just the people you\u2019ve brought\nin to interview, or not just the people that you\u2019ve hired, but who ended up\ndoing well in the position. So it\u2019s a complete loop,\u201d Mondal explains. \u201cAs a\nhuman, it\u2019s very difficult to look at all that data across the lifecycle of an\napplicant. And [with AI] this is being done in seconds.\u201d\n\nThese systems typically operate on a scale greater than a human recruiter. For\ninstance, HireVue claims the artificial intelligence used in its video\nplatform evaluates \u201c[tens of thousands of\nfactors](https://www.hirevue.com/blog/hirevue-assessments-and-preventing-\nalgorithmic-bias).\u201d Even if companies are using the same AI-based hiring tool,\nthey\u2019re likely using a system that\u2019s optimized to their own hiring\npreferences. Plus, an algorithm is likely changing if it\u2019s continuously being\ntrained on new data.\n\nAnother service, Humantic, claims it can get a sense of candidates\u2019 psychology\nbased on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, LinkedIn profiles, and other text-based data an\napplicant might volunteer to submit, by mining through and studying their use\nof language (the product is inspired by the field of psycholinguistics). The\nidea is to eliminate the need for additional personality assessments. \u201cWe try\nto recycle the information that\u2019s already there,\u201d explains Amarpreet Kalkat,\nthe company\u2019s co-founder. He says the service is used by more than 100\ncompanies.\n\nProponents of these recruiting tools also claim that artificial intelligence\ncan be used to avoid human biases, like an unconscious preference for\ngraduates of a particular university, or a bias against women or a racial\nminority. (But AI often amplifies bias; more on that later.) They argue that\nAI can help strip out \u2014 or abstract \u2014 information related to a candidate\u2019s\nidentity, like their name, age, gender, or school, and more fairly consider\napplicants.\n\nThe idea that AI might clamp down on \u2014 or at least do better than \u2014 biased\nhumans inspired California lawmakers earlier this year to introduce [a\nbill](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200ACR125)\nurging fellow policymakers to explore the use of new technology, including\n\u201cartificial intelligence and algorithm-based technologies,\u201d to \u201creduce bias\nand discrimination in hiring.\u201d\n\n### AI tools reflect who builds and trains them\n\nThese AI systems are only as good as the data they\u2019re trained on and the\nhumans that build them. If a r\u00e9sum\u00e9-screening machine learning tool is trained\non historical data, such as r\u00e9sum\u00e9s collected from a company\u2019s previously\nhired candidates, the system will inherit both the conscious and unconscious\npreferences of the hiring managers who made those selections. That approach\ncould help find stellar, highly qualified candidates. But Rieke warns that\nmethod can also pick up \u201csilly patterns that are nonetheless real and\nprominent in a data set.\u201d\n\nOne such r\u00e9sum\u00e9-screening tool identified being named Jared and having played\nlacrosse in high school as the best predictors of job performance, as Quartz\n[reported](https://qz.com/1427621/companies-are-on-the-hook-if-their-hiring-\nalgorithms-are-biased/).\n\nIf you\u2019re a former high school lacrosse player named Jared, that particular\ntool might not sound so bad. But systems [can also learn to be racist, sexist,\nageist, and biased](https://www.vox.com/science-and-\nhealth/2017/4/17/15322378/how-artificial-intelligence-learns-how-to-be-racist)\nin other nefarious ways. For instance,\n[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-\ninsight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-\nwomen-idUSKCN1MK08G) reported last year that Amazon had created a recruitment\nalgorithm that unintentionally **** tended to favor male applicants over\nfemale applicants for certain positions. The system was trained on a decade of\nr\u00e9sum\u00e9s submitted to the company, which Reuters reported were mostly from men.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/YFh37C_1TS7YTgDzG184lKJjr_g=/0x0:3600x2400/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:3600x2400\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19484600/GettyImages_664440974.jpg) A\nvisitor at Intel\u2019s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Day walks past a signboard in\nBangalore, India on April 4, 2017. Manjunath Kiran/AFP via Getty Images\n\n(An Amazon spokesperson told Recode that the system was never used and was\nabandoned for several reasons, including because the algorithms were primitive\nand that the models randomly returned unqualified candidates.)\n\nMondal says there is no way to use these systems without regular, extensive\nauditing. That\u2019s because, even if you explicitly instruct a machine learning\ntool not to discriminate against women, it might inadvertently learn to\ndiscriminate against other proxies associated with being female, like having\ngraduated from a women\u2019s college.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a way to make sure that you aren\u2019t picking people who are\ngrouped in a specific way and that you\u2019re only hiring those types of people,\u201d\nhe says. Ensuring that these systems are not introducing unjust bias means\nfrequently checking that new hires don\u2019t disproportionately represent one\ndemographic group.\n\nBut there\u2019s skepticism that efforts to \u201cde-bias\u201d algorithms and AI are a\ncomplete solution. And Upturn\u2019s report on [equity and hiring\nalgorithms](https://www.upturn.org/reports/2018/hiring-algorithms/) notes that\n\u201c[de-biasing] best practices have yet to crystallize [and] [m]any techniques\nmaintain a narrow focus on individual protected characteristics like gender or\nrace, and rarely address intersectional concerns, where multiple protected\ntraits produce compounding disparate effects.\u201d\n\nAnd if a job is advertised on an online platform like Facebook, it\u2019s possible\nyou won\u2019t even see a posting because of biases produced by _that_ platform\u2019s\nalgorithms. There\u2019s also concern that systems like HireVue\u2019s could inherently\nbe built to[ discriminate against people with certain\ndisabilities](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/10/31/for-some-\nemployment-algorithms-disability-discrimination-by-default/).\n\nCritics are also skeptical of whether these tools do what they say, especially\nwhen they make broad claims about a candidates\u2019 \u201cpredicted\u201d psychology,\nemotion, and suitability for a position. Adina Sterling, an organizational\nbehavior professor at Stanford, also notes that, if not designed carefully, an\nalgorithm could drive its preferences toward a single type of candidate. Such\na system might miss a more unconventional applicant who could nevertheless\nexcel, like an actor applying for a job in sales.\n\n\u201cAlgorithms are good for economies of scale. They\u2019re not good for nuance,\u201d she\nexplains, adding that she doesn\u2019t believe companies are being vigilant enough\nwhen studying the recruitment AI tools they use and checking what these\nsystems actually optimize for.\n\n### Who regulates these tools?\n\nEmployment lawyer Mark Girouard says AI and algorithmic selection systems fall\nunder [the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection\nProcedures](https://nilanjohnson.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Girouard.pdf),\nguidance established in 1978 by federal agencies that guide companies\u2019\nselection standards and employment assessments.\n\nMany of these AI tools [say](https://qz.com/work/1742847/pymetrics-ceo-frida-\npolli-on-the-ai-solution-to-hiring-bias/)\n[they](https://www.hirevue.com/blog/what-is-adverse-impact-and-why-measuring-\nit-matters) follow the four-fifths rule, a statistical \u201crule of thumb\u201d\nbenchmark established under those employee selection guidelines. The rule is\nused to compare the selection rate of applicant demographic groups and\ninvestigate whether selection criteria might have had an adverse impact on a\nprotected minority group.\n\nBut experts have [noted](https://qz.com/work/1742847/pymetrics-ceo-frida-\npolli-on-the-ai-solution-to-hiring-bias/) that the rule is just one test, and\nRieke emphasizes that passing the test doesn\u2019t imply these AI tools do what\nthey claim. A system that picked candidates randomly could pass the test, he\nsays. Girouard explains that as long as a tool does not have a disparate\nimpact on race or gender, there\u2019s no law on the federal level that requires\n**** that such AI tools work as intended.\n\nIn its case against HireVue, EPIC argues that the company has failed to meet\nestablished AI transparency guidelines, including artificial intelligence\nprinciples outlined by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment that have been [endorsed by the U.S and 41 other\ncountries](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2019/us-joins-oecd-adopting-global-\nai-principles). HireVue told Recode that it follows the standards set by the\nUniform Guidelines, as well as guidelines set by other professional\norganizations. The company also says its systems are trained on a diverse data\nset and that its tools have helped its clients increase the diversity of their\nstaff.\n\nAt the state level, Illinois has made some initial headway in promoting the\ntransparent use of these tools. In January, its [Artificial Intelligence Video\nInterview\nAct](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=101-0260)\nwill take effect, which requires that employers using artificial intelligence-\nbased video analysis technology notify, explain, and get the consent of\napplicants.\n\nStill, Rieke says few companies release the methodologies used in their bias\naudits in \u201cmeaningful detail.\u201d He\u2019s not aware of any company that has released\nthe results of an audit conducted by a third party.\n\nMeanwhile, senators have\n[pushed](https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fembeds%2F388920670%2Fcontent%23from_embed&referrer=vox.com&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Frecode%2F2019%2F12%2F12%2F20993665%2Fartificial-\nintelligence-ai-job-screen) the EEOC to investigate whether biased facial\nanalysis algorithms could violate anti-discrimination laws, and experts have\npreviously [warned](https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/10-13-16.cfm)\nthe agency about the risk of algorithmic bias. But the EEOC has yet to release\nany specific guidance regarding algorithmic decision-making or artificial\nintelligence-based tools and did not respond to Recode\u2019s request for comment.\n\nRieke did highlight one potential upside for applicants. Should lawmakers one\nday force companies to release the results of their AI hiring selection\nsystems, job candidates could gain new insight into how to improve their\napplications. But as to whether AI will ever make the final call, Sterling\nsays that\u2019s a long way\u2019s off.\n\n\u201cHiring is an extremely social process,\u201d she explains. \u201cCompanies don\u2019t want\nto relinquish it to tech.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n[_Open Sourced_](http://www.vox.com/open-sourced) _is made possible by Omidyar\nNetwork.

Should\nKnow](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/3_ka4xt9wuedd7ow52ql5q.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * Encourage managers to invest in relationships with recruiting partners\n  * List job requirements that reflect evolving business needs\n  * Determine whether your next hire will raise the bar for your team\n\nThe most important decision a manager makes is whom to hire.\n\nAnd in a competitive job market, getting exactly the right hire can seem like\nan impossible task. But it doesn't need to be.\n\nGallup has decades of experience helping organizations make better hiring\ndecisions using a research-based methodology for understanding what defines\nexcellence in nearly every imaginable role. Over time, three strategies have\nemerged that can help hiring managers feel prepared and not panicked about\nfilling a vacancy.\n\n### **1\\. An \"always be recruiting\" approach underpins an effective hiring\nstrategy.**\n\nSet your hiring managers up for success by creating a culture that allows them\nto invest in key relationships with recruiters. Don't treat recruiters like\nthe utility company by only calling when the lights go out! Rather, view them\nas critical partners and subject matter experts when it comes to sourcing\nfuture team members.\n\nIdeally, hiring managers should view recruiters as critical to their team's\nsuccess. They should take ownership to cultivate relationships and alignment\nby ensuring that:\n\n>   * recruiters know their teams well and understand their current business\n> challenges\n>   * recruiters can identify their stars and can articulate the value they\n> bring\n>   * recruiters know their teams well enough to keep an eye out for\n> candidates who may be future stars\n>   * recruiters are aligned on how future business demands may affect hiring\n> for teams in the future\n>\n\nAllowing hiring managers the time to invest in relationships with their\nrecruiting partners will pay off in the long run. This ongoing alignment\nbetween hiring managers and their recruiting partners helps to ensure that\nwhen unexpected turnover happens, teams won't be left scrambling for help\nbecause these key partners are already on the same page about what is needed.\n\n### **2\\. An agile hiring strategy requires consideration of evolving business\nneeds.**\n\nGiven the rapidly changing workplace, hiring managers are often faced with a\nshifting landscape as they aim to bring in new team members. Constantly\nevolving business needs require new approaches to hiring. Consider, for\nexample, a technology manager tasked with hiring someone who will not only\nreplace some data management tasks, but who will now also spearhead data\nmanagement for new systems and advise key stakeholders on significant\nfindings.\n\nIt is more important than ever to take time to assess how rapidly changing\ndemands may require a shift in requirements for future hires. This is\nessential to an agile hiring strategy. To do this, hiring managers must align\non key job demands needed for the next hire.\n\nWise talent acquisition teams will take time to ascertain the following:\n\n  * What are the key behaviors of high performers in the role? (Or, if this is a new role to the organization or the demands of the job are shifting, what are they intended to be in the future?)\n  * What outcomes are important to success in the role? What is measured, and how is it measured?\n  * What are the main challenges of the role? Are these static challenges, or changing business needs demanding something new for the future?\n  * What skills and knowledge are required for success in the role? What is a \"nice to have\" but not needed?\n\nThese may sound like rudimentary questions, but it's important to get \"back to\nthe basics\" when hiring. Pausing to determine what success looks like, define\nhow success is measured and reflect on high performers helps to build an\nimportant case for the ideal hire.\n\nDo your hiring managers ask these types of questions? Do they have a framework\nthat helps them determine key behaviors or common traits that lead to success\nin the role? Answering these questions will help them articulate to your\nrecruiting staff the types of candidates they're looking for.\n\nIt is more important than ever to take time to assess how rapidly changing\ndemands may require a shift in requirements for future hires.\n\nThe answers to these questions can also help hiring managers frame job ads to\naccurately reflect key requirements of the role so your teams attract the\nright candidates. Ultimately, asking such questions helps shift the focus from\n\"who will be hired\" to \"what specific job demands will be expected of a new\nhire to succeed.\"\n\n### **3\\. A winning hiring strategy means raising the bar with each new\nhire.**\n\nHiring managers sometimes tend to have a narrow perspective when thinking\nabout their next hire. They can easily fall into what Daniel Kahneman calls\nthe \"availability heuristic,\" often cited as a mental shortcut that results in\ngiving undue weight to what is top of mind. For example, when thinking about\nwhom they want to hire, they often think about replicating their former best\nemployee -- or the opposite, replacing a failed employee that they don't want\nto repeat. The point is not to overlook top performers, but rather to\ncarefully consider what high performance is expected to look like considering\nthe evolving needs of the team.\n\nSo, how can you save your hiring managers from falling into the \"availability\nheuristic\" trap? The authors of \"[Outsmart Your Own\nBiases](https://hbr.org/2015/05/outsmart-your-own-\nbiases?utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_269714&utm_medium=copy)\"\nsuggest taking a more deliberate approach and inviting either an internal\nreview or an outsider's perspective. Further, to avoid bias traps, they\nsuggest using objective data and not just \"what you've seen and heard\" data.\nStructured, validated assessments allow hiring managers to target the\ninformation they need, enabling them to step back and assess candidates\nobjectively. Such assessments are validated to predict performance across a\nrange of roles.\n\nTo this end, Gallup researchers have identified five general innate traits, or\ntendencies, that predict performance across job types. These\n[traits](https://www.gallup.com/itsthemanager/245324/manager.aspx) include\nMotivation, or a drive for achievement; another example is Initiation, or\ntaking action and inspiring others to succeed.\n\nAnalytics-based hiring -- using assessments designed to identify people with\ninnate tendencies that predict performance -- can help hiring managers\nobjectively sort to those candidates with the most potential for excellence.\n\nThe point is not to overlook top performers, but rather to carefully consider\nwhat high performance is expected to look like considering the evolving needs\nof the team.\n\nHere is the deal, though: When hiring managers select those with the potential\nfor excellence, it raises the bar for onboarding and engaging these new\nemployees. If potential isn't properly developed, people never approach the\n\"ceiling\" of their potential \u2026 and the rationale for hiring people with a\n\"higher ceiling\" in the first place is actually defeated. This reinforces the\nneed for alignment across your organization. Hiring managers need to align\nboth with their best recruiting partners and with other key partners\nthroughout the organization to ensure an excellent overall employee experience\nfor each new hire they invest in.\n\nIn sum, take proactive steps to set your hiring managers up for success.\nEncourage them to invest in their relationships with recruiters, make sure\nthey consider evolving business needs in their hiring approach, and enable\nthem to hold out for excellence in their next hire.

It's important to note that talent\nacquisition and recruitment aren't synonymous. Recruitment is just one aspect\nof talent acquisition, that has to do with the selection and hiring of a\ncandidate to fit a job vacancy. Talent acquisition, on the other hand, has a\nfar broader ambit.\n\nThe definition of talent acquisition spans employer branding, recruitment\nmarketing, the process of\n**[recruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-recruitment/)** itself, which includes [candidate\nrelationship management](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/), an onboarding plan\nthat involves succession planning and talent development, and continuous\nstrategic alignment with C-level goals.\n\nToday, a talent acquisition strategy is critical for:\n\n  * Identifying candidates who are likely to provide an excellent culture fit\n  * Finding/Creating new roles if a compelling candidate is available in the market\n  * Assessing passive candidates for possible roles in the organization\n  * Positioning a company as a \u201cpreferred employer\u201d to young professionals, building an uninterrupted **[talent pipeline](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-talent-pipeline/)**\n\n  \nImportantly, the talent acquisition function doesn\u2019t just involve HR.\n\nFor example, stakeholders across marketing and sales, public relations, and\nlearning and development all play a key role in helping a company attract and\nnurture top talent. As a result, large enterprises often dedicate a separate\nteam to talent acquisition \u2013 independent of HR \u2013 comprising professionals with\ncross-disciplinary expertise in all these areas.\n\nNow that the definition of talent acquisition is clear, let\u2019s break down the\nprocess into its five essential components.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Talent Acquisition vs. Recruitment: Key Differences and\nSimilarities**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-vs-recruitment/)\n\n## **Understanding the Talent Acquisition Process: 5 Steps Towards Success**\n\nThe entire recruiting and talent acquisition process is undergoing a major\nupheaval with the changing preferences of the young workforce and the rising\ndemand for cutting-edge skills \u2013 for example, cloud competencies, digital\nmarketing, or artificial intelligence (AI). And proving this is the 2019 State\nof Talent Acquisition Report by Mettl reveals that 74% of companies surveyed\nare still struggling to hire top talent.\n\nAn essential best practice for talent acquisition managers today is to treat\ncandidates like consumers. In other words, lessons from digital marketing can\nbe instrumental when you're looking to build a robust talent acquisition\nfunction. Let's explore the talent acquisition process in this context.\n\n![Five steps that complete the talent acquisition process](/images/ajax-\nloader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. Five steps that complete the talent acquisition process**\n\n### **1\\. Inbound marketing**\n\n  \nAs a talent acquisition manager, your goal is to attract the best talent out\nthere without you actively seeking them out. This means building a strong\nemployer brand, initiating recruitment marketing campaigns, and keeping an eye\non inbound leads that will soon convert into hired employees.\n\nTo enable inbound recruiting in the talent acquisition process, create a smart\nrecruitment website, encourage referrals, and leverage candidate-focused\ncontent to create an \u201cemployer brand\u201d narrative.\n\n### **2\\. Outbound marketing**\n\n  \nAny successful brand leverages a smart mix of inbound and outbound marketing\nto acquire consumers. So you should be looking at social channels, paid job\nads, and automated email campaigns to advertise for a job post actively. Use\nthis step to ramp up your recruitment efforts with intelligent job\ndescriptions. Together, inbound and outbound initiatives will generate many\n\u201cleads\u201d or applicants.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Talent Sourcing? Definition, Process, Strategy with\nExamples**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-sourcing/)\n\n### **3\\. Filtering and selection**\n\n  \nAt this stage, talent acquisition diverges from regular marketing. You aren\u2019t\nlooking to hire just anyone who wants to join the company. You will verify,\nscreen, and assess a candidate\u2019s performance against various parameters. This\nincludes:\n\n  * Educational qualifications (though a lot of companies are pushing this to the backseat and placing priority on the next four parameters)\n  * Skill set and domain expertise\n  * Personality and work ethic\n  * Career goals and alignment\n  * Culture fit with the company\u2019s values\n\n  \nCulture is probably the most important for organizations now. For example, if\nyour organization prioritizes regular work hours and physical attendance, a\ncandidate with a history of remote working and flexible operations may not be\na good fit, even though they bring the desired skill set to the table.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Candidate Screening and Selection Process: The Complete\nGuide for 2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-screening-and-selection/)\n\n### **4\\. Conversion and onboarding**\n\n  \nThe first three steps in the talent acquisition process lead to \u201cconverting\u201d\nthe applicant into a finalized hire. This is where the individual recruiter\ntakes charge of the candidate experience and the candidate journey and\nnegotiates salary, benefits, and other expectations.\n\nHowever, if your talent acquisition strategy has helped in creating an\nattractive employer brand that\u2019s in sync with the applicant\u2019s professional\ntargets, your applicant-to-recruit ratio will remain high.\n\nA talent acquisition strategy also accounts for a strategic [onboarding\nprocess](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-\nis-new-employee-onboarding/), though this process is carried out by HR and\nimmediate managers. The\n**[onboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/)** process involves preliminary\ntraining and continuous reviews for the first few weeks.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020\nHires**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/)\n\n### **5\\. Continuous improvement**\n\n  \nThis is probably the most critical step of the process, ensuring your talent\nacquisition mechanism becomes more effective with every recruitment cycle. A\nrecent Jobvite study found that 30% of new hires leave within 90 days of\njoining a company!\n\nThis means that regular reviews are necessary for this critical early period\nto sustain engagement. Also, the feedback gathered from \u201cconverted\u201d applicants\ncan offer insights into how to improve the hiring experience.\n\nThese five steps make up the talent acquisition process. Remember, this is a\ncyclical function \u2013 by its very definition, talent acquisition continues even\nif there are no open vacancies. Inbound marketing, brand building, and data\nreviews are ongoing processes that lead to the hiring of quality talent.\n\nLet\u2019s now consider the top talent acquisition strategies that should be part\nof your HR blueprint.\n\n## **Vital Talent Acquisition Strategies to Explore**\n\nSo, what is a talent acquisition strategy? Talent acquisition strategies help\nyou to address a variety of recruitment scenarios \u2013 here are the ones you\nshould keep in mind:\n\n### **1\\. Talent acquisition for bulk recruitment**\n\n  \nRemember, hiring in bulk is significantly different from hiring for a single\nrole. Not only do you have to ramp up your talent acquisition pipeline without\nincreasing costs, but you also need to maintain the quality of every\ncandidate.\n\nA strategy for high-volume recruitment will involve candidate sourcing, using\nsoftware to automate repetitive tasks (for example, resume processing,\nbackground verification, offer generation, etc.), and group surveys to obtain\nthe data needed to make hiring decisions.\n\n### **2\\. Hiring for strategic roles**\n\n  \nFinding the right candidate for a senior position is always a challenge, as\nthey cannot afford the initial \u201cteething period\u201d that\u2019s available to junior\nworkers. From their very first day, senior recruits are meant to take the\nreins and steer the company towards success.\n\nThat's why you need a dedicated strategy for senior professionals, with\nentirely different rules of sourcing and engagement. It is a good idea to\npartner with leadership hiring agencies to meet such talent acquisition\nrequirements.\n\n### **3\\. Internal hiring strategy**\n\n  \nResearch finds that employee referrals are the most preferred talent\nacquisition mechanism, despite an explosion in the number of job boards and\nsocial recruiting sites. The reason for this is apparent \u2013 internally sourced\ncandidates come pre-vetted in terms of personality and culture fit, markedly\nreducing the workload on talent acquisition managers.\n\nA few best practices when building an internal talent acquisition strategy are\ngamification to encourage referrals, active endorsement seeking across the\ncompany, and a smart rewards program for those who refer potential employees.\n\n### **4\\. Strategies for technical hires**\n\n  \nWith digital transformation placed as a formative force across enterprises,\ntechnical hires now need a dedicated talent acquisition strategy. This will\nrely more on skill tests and demonstrated assessments rather than on\ninterviews and previous experience. Technical hires also demand a unique\nemployer brand that intersects their skill set with a \u201clarger sense of\npurpose.\u201d\n\nWith the right strategy, it is possible even for non-tech companies to lure\ntech talent from the FAANGs of the world. There are solutions designed\nspecifically for technical hiring \u2014 for example, HackerRank, Codility, and\nCodinGame For Work.\n\nApart from this, you could also formulate talent acquisition strategies for\ntemporary roles, external workers, and a host of other scenarios.\n\n## **4 Best Practices for Talent Acquisition**\n\nWhile every talent acquisition strategy is unique in its objectives and\nimplementation, they have four best practices in common.\n\n![Four best practices that enable effective talent acquisition](/images/ajax-\nloader.png)\n\n**Fig 2. Four best practices that enable effective talent acquisition**\n\n### **1\\. Look for potential, not just for performance**\n\n  \nJust because an applicant has displayed exemplary performance in an earlier\nposition, it does not imply that the same holds for future roles.\n\nFor example, cross-disciplinary hires cannot be assessed on past performance.\nA tech professional transitioning from a software developer role into\nmarketing must be interviewed to identify competencies for the new position,\nsoft skills, and eagerness to learn.\n\n### **2\\. Prioritize internal mobility**\n\n  \nSome of your best talent will be sourced from referrals and internal hires. To\ncraft a talent acquisition strategy that focuses on internal mobility, it is\nvital to have a robust cross-skilling program in place. Employees must be\nencouraged to pursue a career trajectory outside of their immediate\nprofessional ambit. Additionally, a gamified platform can help to encourage\nnominees both within and outside the organization.\n\nRemember, internal referrals are a great way to obtain verification and\nprevalidate a candidate even before they enter the talent acquisition\npipeline.\n\n### **3\\. Rethink who falls under talent acquisition**\n\n  \nToo often, talent acquisition is limited to employees on the company\u2019s direct\npayroll. However, several organizations regularly employ seasonal workers,\nhourly employees, and external consultants who operate on a project-to-project\nbasis. These individuals can also be converted into full-time professionals in\nthe organization.\n\nTalent acquisition managers must keep these individuals in mind when defining\ntheir strategies.\n\n### **4\\. Advertise strategically**\n\n  \nAnd here's where talent acquisition differs from a typical recruitment\npipeline \u2013 talent acquisition managers must intelligently advertise the\nemployer brand to get the requisite applicants. This makes the choice of\nadvertising platforms critical.\n\nDirect your investments towards target groups based on the nature of talent\nyou\u2019re trying to acquire \u2013 for example, tech talent \u2013 new products on the\nbusiness roadmap for which you will require new skills and talent sources that\nhave proved useful in the past.\n\nThese are some of the talent acquisition best practices to keep in mind when\nlooking to hire the best-fit applicants out there. But a key focus that should\nform the core of your talent acquisition strategy is researching and selecting\na robust talent acquisition platform.\n\n## **Streamlining Talent Acquisition with Technology: The Way Forward**\n\nOnce you\u2019ve read this definitive guide on what is talent acquisition, it's\nclear that manual efforts aren't enough. For example, key steps such as\ninbound and outbound marketing, data extraction, technical skill assessment,\nand recruitment marketing could be made far simpler with the timely\nintervention of intelligent technologies.\n\nSome of the key tools to keep in mind in this regard are:\n\n  * Social recruiting platforms like LinkedIn\n  * **[Applicant tracking systems](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-applicant-tracking-systems/)** such as Greenhouse and Bullhorn\n  * Predictive analytics to assess candidate-to-job role fitment\n  * A conversational interface powered by **[candidate relationship management](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/)** software for automated follow-ups\n  * Scheduling tools to streamline the **[candidate experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\n\n  \nFortunately, there are several solutions out there that help to simplify the\nentire talent acquisition process, with the timely intervention of technology\nand a flexible SaaS model.\n\nA smart combination of the best-fit strategies and an acute understanding of\ntalent acquisition best practices is the paving stone towards selecting\nsoftware that\u2019s right for you. You may also consider the possibility of using\nmultiple software for the talent acquisition process, starting with screening\nsoftware such as AllyO, an interview software such as HireVue, a skills\nassessment platform such as Codility, an ATS, and a separate employer branding\nsolution such as Glassdoor.\n\nSo, as you look at standing out in a tight labor market and attract the\nbrightest talent, remember that the definition of talent acquisition is unique\nand perfectly fluid to meet the requirements of your organization.\n\nWhat\u2019s required is a razor-sharp focus on individual necessities, coupled with\na regular check-in on the latest winning ideas to arrive at a solution that is\nup to date, individualized, and effective.\n\n_Do you have a talent acquisition strategy in place for 2020?

In 2018, the flu cost\nU.S. companies $18 billion in lost productivity, reports Gartner. However, a\ndifferent virus has received far more media coverage and is stirring much more\nanxiety: the coronavirus, which has caused a near economic shutdown in China\nand has prompted travelers returning from that country to undergo special\nscreening and possible quarantine.\n\n**The latest:**[ **\u2018Handshake-free\u2019 meetings and other coronavirus\nprecautions**](https://hrexecutive.com/handshake-free-meetings-and-other-\ncoronavirus-precautions/)\n\nAlthough organizations must take precautions to guard their employees from\ncoronavirus, experts are concerned that fear and misinformation could\nultimately land companies in legal jeopardy.\n\nAttorney Bob Nichols, who counseled clients through the SARS virus of 2003 and\nthe H1N1 virus of 2009, says misinformation about coronavirus may be a bigger\nthreat in the U.S. at the moment than the virus itself. So far, only 18 cases\nhave been reported in the U.S., although that number is likely to rise.\n\n\u201cThe [common flu](https://hrexecutive.com/cost-of-the-flu/), which is worse\nthis year than most, is a much more significant threat to U.S. workers than\nthe coronavirus,\u201d says Nichols, a partner at Bracewell LP in Houston. \u201cThe\nmost important thing HR leaders can do is to maintain that perspective and\nguard against over-reaction.\u201d\n\nBy providing employees with accurate information about coronavirus, HR can\nmaintain good order and protect the organization against potential liability,\nhe says. The [Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and the\n[Occupational Safety and Health\nAdministration](https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/novel_coronavirus/) have good\ninformation on their websites that HR can share with employees to ensure\nthey\u2019re relying on facts, not hearsay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\u201cKeep them aware of the CDC guidance on this topic and that will keep them\ncalm,\u201d says Nichols.\n\nFears about the coronavirus are understandable. As of Monday, the virus has\nkilled more than 900 people in China\u2014including 97 just on Feb. 9\u2014and infected\nmore than 40,000 globally, [reports CNN](https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-\nnews/coronavirus-outbreak-02-10-20-intl-hnk/index.html). Scientists still\naren\u2019t entirely sure how the virus is transmitted and, for now, there is no\nvaccine to guard against it. Government agencies and pharmaceutical companies\nare working to develop a coronavirus vaccine, but it will be months before one\nis ready.\n\nNevertheless, companies shouldn\u2019t allow fear to dictate their response to the\nthreat or rumors to undermine employee morale.\n\n\u201cSo as to avoid the spread of misinformation, HR should endeavor to ensure\nthat employees aren\u2019t sharing false information or gossiping about others,\u201d\nsays Susan Gross Sholinksy, a member of the employment, labor and workforce\nmanagement practice at Epstein Becker Green.\n\nEmployers should also ensure that employees aren\u2019t refusing to interact with\ncolleagues and/or customers who are of Asian descent, she adds. Such behavior\ncould lead to complaints about discrimination based on national origin and\nethnicity, or it could even be \u201cregarded as\u201d disability discrimination.\n\n\u201cRather, any actions taken (or avoided) should be based on whether an\nindividual is likely to have been exposed to the virus,\u201d Gross Sholinsky says.\n\n**\u201cSimple But Important Steps\u201d**\n\nThe blanket media coverage of coronavirus is a good reminder for HR\ndepartments to emphasize preventative steps for guarding the workplace against\nall viruses, says Dr. Teresa Bartlett, senior vice president and medical\ndirector at Sedgwick. It\u2019s especially timely given this season\u2019s virulent flu\noutbreak.\n\nBartlett, who regularly consults with large company clients, says the No. 1\npriority should be reviewing the company\u2019s illness and absence policies and\nreminding employees about them.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want people coming to work sick,\u201d she says. \u201cSet clear guidelines:\n\u2018If you have a cough, a cold, upper-respiratory-illness symptoms, then we\ndon\u2019t want you at work.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWhen possible, allow people to work from home, says Bartlett.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to have clear guidelines for workplace behavior,\nparticularly during a flu outbreak, she says.\n\n\u201cCounsel employees to consider bumping elbows in lieu of shaking hands,\u201d says\nBartlett. Limit in-person meetings when possible, have hand sanitizer widely\navailable and remind folks to cough into their elbow, not their hand, she\nsays.\n\nCommon surfaces should be sanitized as often as possible, says Bartlett.\n\u201cDoorknobs, elevator buttons, surfaces in the cafeteria\u2014even toilet handles.\nSanitizing these surfaces will go a long way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are simple but important steps,\u201d she adds.\n\n**Lessons from Past Outbreaks**\n\nHR should have a plan ready to deploy should any major outbreak wreak havoc on\ncompany operations, says Bartlett. Such a plan should be created in\npartnership with other departments, including risk management, finance and IT,\nshe says.\n\n\u201cHave something you can easily turn to during times like this,\u201d says Bartlett.\n\nViral outbreaks that occurred earlier this century offer some useful lessons.\nA [recent report from\nGartner](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-questions-for-an-hr-\npandemic-plan/) summarizes the steps taken by companies in the wake of the\nSARS and H1N1 viruses, which also originated in Asia and posed major potential\ndisruptions to the global economy. In the wake of these outbreaks, American\nExpress set up criteria to validate the threats of the next pandemic. It\nincluded both the impact on the business and the impact on the community to\ndetermine \u201cthresholds for action.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nGoodyear focused on having a plan in place to ensure \u201ccritical roles\u201d would be\nmaintained in the event of a pandemic. Each business unit or region was asked\nto identify critical roles. Next, the company organized those roles by\ncategory: essential, temporary suspension and extended suspension (roles that\ncould be suspended without undue harm to the business). Goodyear analyzed its\ntalent bench to determine the difficulty of backfilling essential roles and\nmade adjustments as necessary.\n\n**For China-Based Employees**\n\nOrganizations that have expatriate employees in China or a significant\nworkforce there should carefully monitor travel guidelines to the region, says\nthe Business Group on Health (formerly the National Business Group on Health).\nThe BGH has released [guidelines for\nemployers](https://www.businessgrouphealth.org/topics/blog/the-evolving-\nsituation-of-coronavirus-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont) that have significant\nbusiness in Asia, noting that the U.S. State Dept. has advised against travel\nto China.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Level 4: Do Not Travel\u2019 advisory is the highest level of warning the\nState Department gives for travel,\u201d the BGH notes.\n\nFor companies concerned that an employee was exposed to coronavirus, law firm\nLittler [recommends](https://www.littler.com/publication-\npress/publication/coronavirus-employer-action-items) instructing the employee\nto stay home for up to 14 days to ensure they don\u2019t show symptoms of the\nvirus. The employee should not return to work until they\u2019ve received a\n\u201cfitness-for-duty/return-to-work\u201d notice.\n\nIf an employee has contracted coronavirus, Littler advises contacting the CDC\nand the local health department immediately and having a hazmat company clean\nand disinfect the workplace. Other employees should be notified and the\ncompany should consider allowing employees to expense medical tests for\ndetecting the virus.\n\nCompanies must proceed carefully, taking care to ensure their policies for\ndealing with coronavirus don\u2019t unwittingly discriminate: \u201cIt is possible, and\nindeed likely, that the coronavirus will disproportionately affect members of\na protected class. While the risk of discrimination is likely small, employers\nmust be cognizant of this fact \u2026 .\u201d says Littler.\n\n\u201cEmployers should ensure that employees aren\u2019t improperly creating a hostile\nenvironment for employees of Asian descent due simply to their national origin\nor ethnicity,\u201d says Gross Sholinsky.\n\nAndrew R.

many HR professionals aren't keen on using social platforms\nto find talent.\n\nBy: [Carol Patton](https://hrexecutive.com/author/carol-patton/ \"Posts by\nCarol Patton\") | February 14, 2020 \u2022 2 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) |\n[Recruiting](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/recruiting/)

recruitment tool, HR must\ndevelop a digital-marketing strategy and positive candidate experience.\n\n\u201cIf you have a reasonable, frictionless candidate experience, then social\nmedia becomes a viable way to reach people,\u201d says Ira Wolfe, president and\nchief googlization officer at Success Performance Solutions, a national HR-\nconsulting firm. \u201cSocial media is an extraordinary [recruitment] opportunity.\nIt\u2019s word of mouth on steroids.\u201d\n\nBut not all HR professionals experience good results. According to a [national\nsurvey](https://clutch.co/hr/resources/7-recruitment-strategies-hire-top-\nemployees) of more than 500 HR professionals by Clutch\u2014a B2B ratings and\nreviews platform\u2014nearly one out of four (24%) ranked social media as their\nleast favorite recruiting strategy, ahead of passive recruiting (17%) and\nuniversity career fairs (13%).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nThe problem, says Wolfe, focuses less on social media and more on HR\nprofessionals who fail to create a comprehensive marketing strategy that\nincludes social-media components. There must be strong collaboration between\nHR and marketing since HR leaders generally aren\u2019t skilled or experienced at\nmaximizing the six primary social-media platforms for recruiting: Facebook,\nInstagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest and, yes, even YouTube.\n\nBesides, not all platforms are alike, adds Wolfe, the author of _[Recruiting\nin the Age of Googlization](https://join.googlizationnation.com/)_ , which\naddresses recruitment strategies in a fast-changing world; he\u2019s giving away\nthe first 500 copies for free (excluding postage).\n\nRecruiters need to identify which ones attract their target audiences and then\nfigure out the purpose, tone and feel of their messaging. Wolfe says where you\npost information\u2014even job ads\u2014should never be arbitrary. As an example, he\nsays, Instagram or Pinterest can be very helpful when recruiting retail or\nhospitality workers but not necessarily highly skilled professionals.\n\n**[Related: Stop spying on social media](https://hrexecutive.com/stop-spying-\non-social-media/)**\n\nYet, despite recruiters\u2019 best efforts, candidates can still slip away, says\nWolfe, pointing to a career page that turns them off or a difficult\napplication process. Based on his own research with new clients, he says, the\nabandonment rate on career sites averages 50% but can even soar to 90%. Make\nsure your site tells a compelling story that explains why candidates may want\nto work for your organization versus simply describing job responsibilities,\nhe cautions.\n\nLikewise, pay attention to language. If you want to attract more women to a\nmale-dominated field, write the job ad and promotional materials from a female\nvoice.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going after a more diverse demographic, the language needs to\nexpress the needs of that gender, ethnicity or race,\u201d Wolfe adds. \u201cTell a\nstory that fits into their life, not yours.\u201d\n\nCarol Patton is a contributing editor for _HRE_ who also writes HR articles\nand columns for business and education magazines.

will offer plenty to see and hear\nwhen it comes to AI-based recruiting solutions.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | September 5, 2019 \u2022 2 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [HR\nTechnology Conference News](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-\ntechnology-conference/) |\n[Recruiting](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/recruiting/) |\n[Top

having a real and serious impact on the HR\nindustry, so it\u2019s no surprise that some of the most innovative AI-solutions\nproviders will be part of the [HR Tech Conference and\nExpo](https://www.hrtechnologyconference.com/index?__hstc=251975894.061311edd0d75c5d4817ae56721fb648.1565270760073.1565270760073.1565270760073.1&__hssc=251975894.8.1565270760073&__hsfp=165344926&_ga=2.162789628.1571212934.1565270740-2025185540.1565270740)\n(Oct. 1-4 at the Venetian in Las Vegas).\n\nCompanies like AllyO (Booth 2600) and Socrates.ai (Booth 2533) head a list of\ninnovators that also includes Eightfold (Booth 2522), Leena (Booth 2328), Mya\nSystems (Booth 817) and Tara.ai (Booth 1111).\n\nRecruiting-solutions provider AllyO, for example, is the most-funded and\nhighest-valued AI for HR company worldwide, as it has partnered with 15% of\nFortune 50 companies to automate talent acquisition and management. Backed by\ninvestors such as Google, SAP, Randstad, Bain and Cervin Ventures, AllyO\u2019s\n\u201cconversational AI\u201d offers regular updates, analytics and notifications when\n\u201chuman intelligence\u201d is necessary. It engages with talent through texting,\nwebsite chatboxes, WhatsApp, voice and email.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nSocrates.ai uses artificial intelligence and natural-language processing to\nprovde an experience vastly similar to consumer-facing technologies. According\nto Randy Womack, the firm\u2019s CEO, its AI solutions give organizations the\nopportunity to provide a single point of entry for employees to securely\naccess enterprise systems of record like Workday, Kronos, SAP SuccessFactors,\nand SMS or other messaging platforms using a conversation methodology and AI\ntechnology.\n\nWomack has served as CEO at Aasonn, COO at Castlight Health, CIO at\nSuccessFactors and Digital River and as a Fast Forward Partner at Greylock\nPartners. He also helped take three of these early-stage companies to the\npublic markets, and has held positions at Oracle, Xerox and Dell.\n\nIf the expo floor isn\u2019t enough for AI information seekers, there are several\n[AI and recruiting-focused sessions](http://hrexecutive.com/here-are-3-ai-\nsessions-to-catch-at-upcoming-hr-tech-expo/) within the show\u2019s [artificial\nintelligence\ntracks](https://s23.a2zinc.net/clients/lrp/hrtechnologyconference2019/Public/Sessions.aspx?TrackId=248&View=Sessions_summary),\nincluding:\n\n[Learning to Work with AI In\nRecruiting](https://s23.a2zinc.net/clients/lrp/hrtechnologyconference2019/Public/SessionDetails.aspx?FromPage=Sessions.aspx&SessionID=5134&SessionDateID=184)\n\nIn this session, Dmitri Krakovsky, vice president of Google, will discuss how\nAI and machine-learning solutions are becoming increasingly common in the HR-\nsoftware industry. Krakovsky is sure to talk about Google\u2019s AI Principles and\nResponsible AI Practices for software systems. To support an attendee\u2019s\nsoftware-vendor-selection journey, this is a great session for understanding\nbest practices that address considerations unique to machine learning, such as\nusing human-centered design, the potential limitations of your data sets and\nmodels, and how to test and monitor systems post-deployment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n[Experience the Job, Experience AI: Create Candidate-Friendly Experiences and\nMake Hiring Decisions Bias-\nFree](https://s23.a2zinc.net/clients/lrp/hrtechnologyconference2019/Public/SessionDetails.aspx?FromPage=Sessions.aspx&SessionID=5335&SessionDateID=185)\n\nHere, executives from Bank of America and Shaker International will explore\nhow the latter is applying AI to support hiring in a transformational human-\ncentered approach at BofA. The panel of experts will discuss how traditional\nbest practices in hiring can be merged with leading-edge technologies to\ncreate a new AI-human hybrid approach that is intelligible, bias-free,\ncandidate-friendly and, above all, highly predictive of new-hire success. This\nsession will be a fantastic chance to pick up practical, actionable ideas on\nhow leading-edge HR technology and AI powered tools can improve the recruiting\nprocess and lead to better hiring decisions.\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

By allowing them\nto automate key tasks, providing seamless access to data and information, and\nfacilitating the creation of analytics-based insights, HCM technology can\nenhance an HR team\u2019s efforts to attract and retain talent, engage and\ncommunicate with employees, and streamline payroll and benefits processes.\n\nBut if HCM technology is so great, then why aren\u2019t more companies realizing\ngame-changing benefits from implementing it? The answer lies in these\ncompanies\u2019 implementation processes, not in the technology itself. Too often,\nHR leaders approach these implementations as technology projects. Instead,\nthey need to approach them as overhauls of business processes. Here are three\nguiding principles companies should follow as they seek to maximize the\nreturns on their investments in HCM technology.\n\n### **1\\. Plan ahead to ensure organizational readiness**\n\n  \nLack of organizational readiness before an HCM technology implementation is\none of the main reasons companies end up disappointed with their systems. As\nwe\u2019ve noted, a company must view a technology implementation as a business\nprocess redesign. To effectively execute this business process redesign, HR\nleaders must lay the proper groundwork.\n\nFirst, consider the selection of the technology platform. When a company\ncompares different platforms, it should focus first and foremost on how the\ntechnology will help it achieve its sought-after process improvements and meet\nits business goals. When solutions were largely on-premises, it was easier to\ncustomize features and functionality. Today, however, technology vendors\ndeliver more standardized solutions in the cloud. If an organization completes\nproper due diligence during the selection process, most of the features it\nneeds are going to be in the HCM platform it selects. So, a fixation on\nfeatures is largely fruitless. Instead, HR leaders need to more heavily weight\na system\u2019s usability. Leaders should be asking things like:\n\n  * Will the system help us improve talent acquisition efforts and even automate some of these processes?\n  * Will users from across the company \u2013 beyond the HR team \u2013 be able to interact with the system easily?\n\n  \nReorienting the focus away from features and functionality and toward\nusability and business goals will help HR leaders select the right platform\nfor their organization\u2019s needs.\n\nAnother key piece of organizational readiness is securing executive support.\nHR leaders must make a clear business case for the technology and outline the\nexpected benefits of the project to company leaders. This effort will help the\nHR team recruit an executive sponsor who can publicly make the case for the\ninitiative across the organization, which will help smooth implementation.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is HRIS? System, Model and\nApplication](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)**\n\n### **2\\. Focus on processes before implementation**\n\n  \nIf an HR team does not redesign its processes alongside the technology\nimplementation, it will severely limit the benefits it can realize from its\nnew HCM system. Essentially, the team will plop a new technology platform on\ntop of outdated processes. To take full advantage of these modern systems,\nit\u2019s crucial to also modernize business processes.\n\nStart with thorough process documentation, which includes outlining the HR\nprocesses the team uses currently. Then, determine how to best leverage the\ncapabilities of the new system to complete HR processes more efficiently and\neffectively. Performing this thorough audit and charting out new processes\nbefore beginning a technology implementation will pay dividends once the\ncompany goes live with the technology. By investing more time in the planning\nand process redesign phases, the company will reduce the amount of post-\ndeployment changes it will need to make. The company will also make the\ntransition easier on its employees.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Optimize the Employee Life-cycle with HR\nTechnology](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/compensation-benefits/how-\nto-optimize-the-employee-lifecycle-with-hr-technology/)**\n\n### **3\\. Manage change effectively**\n\n  \nA critical determinant of the success or failure of an HCM technology\nimplementation is how well HR leaders manage change. Embracing new technology\nand processes requires employees to alter behaviors in sometimes disruptive\nways. Therefore, HR leaders must offer both thorough technical training on the\nins and outs of the new system as well as immersive training on the new\nbusiness processes.\n\nCompanies must be willing to devote significant time and resources to this\npiece of the project. After all, for the team to realize the anticipated\nefficiency gains, all employees need to embrace the new processes and\ntechnology. HR leaders should secure employees\u2019 buy-in by making clear that\nthey made the process and technology changes to improve the team\u2019s\nproductivity and free employees from rote, manual processes. In the end, these\nchanges should enable employees to perform higher-value \u2013 and ultimately more\nrewarding \u2013 work.\n\nAfter all the effort HR leaders put into preparing for implementation and then\ncarrying out the implementation, it\u2019s crucial that they finish the job by\ndevoting time and energy to effective change management.\n\n## **Run toward the transformative benefits of HCM technology**\n\nThe fact that some HR teams fail to realize the full benefits of HCM\ntechnology shouldn\u2019t scare others off. HCM technology today can supercharge an\nHR team\u2019s effectiveness \u2013 but only if HR leaders lay the proper groundwork and\nview the technology as a key component of business process optimization. The\ncompanies that do prioritize organizational readiness, process refinement and\nchange management will enjoy smooth and rewarding implementations \u2013 and\ncapitalize on the many transformative benefits of HCM technology.\n\n**Learn More:[3 Ways HR Technology Builds Workplace\nTrust](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/3-ways-hr-technology-\nbuilds-workplace-trust/)**\n\n[![Bill Larkin](/images/ajax-loader.png)](https://www.sikich.com/team/bill-\nlarkin/)\n\n## **Co-author:**\n\n[Bill Larkin](https://www.sikich.com/team/bill-larkin/) has extensive\nknowledge of the Human Capital Management (HCM) technology industry and its\neffect on business results.

Artificial intelligence in recruitment has already\nbeen developed. Everyone understands what tasks AI helps solve and which\nroutines and errors it relieves, but no one understands how to measure the\neconomic effect of using it.**_\n\nIn other words, companies can calculate how much money AI will cost, but they\ndo not understand ROI or how much money AI will bring or save. Slogans like\n\u201cclose vacancies two times faster with (such and such software)\u201d are just not\ntrue.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834bf8d52f2.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nMisunderstanding what AI gives for recruiting in money leads to companies\npostponing this investment for years, and during this time a lot is lost as a\nresult. For example, if we talk about companies that offer _cheap assignment\nhelp_ and regularly look for writers to work in their team, it is necessary\nfor them to understand how to measure the ROI of AI.\n\nIn 2018, there were cases where AI was used in a suboptimal manner, which\nentailed undesirable effects. One of the most recent examples is that AI was\nmore preferable for men than for women. On the other hand, technologies in the\nfield of recruiting and personnel management are still evolving, and more and\nmore new solutions based on AI are emerging.\n\nI chose three methods for using AI in recruiting which I believe are in trend\nin 2019.\n\n  1. Automated search for candidates\n  2. Repeated candidate detection\n  3. Selection of candidates  \n\n## **Automated search for candidates**\n\nThe search for talent begins with identifying potential candidates and\nbuilding a funnel. But even if you know where to find these potential\ncandidates (job sites, social networks, etc.), this can be quite a challenge.\nThe development of AI allows the recruiter to automate the process and expand\nthe search field.\n\nSome AI solutions can analyze more than 300 million profiles in social\nnetworks, which even a small army of people could not do. In addition,\nspeaking of time-consuming tasks, technology automation allows you to send\npersonalized messages to candidates to keep them working without the\nparticipation of a recruiter.\n\n## **Repeated candidate detection**\n\nLet\u2019s move forward with a candidate a little further along the funnel.\nSometimes there are so many profiles in our database that some potentially\ninteresting candidates just remain unnoticed. In today\u2019s competitive labor\nmarket, it is especially important not to miss the talents that may be right\nin front of you.\n\nInstead of spending a lot of time and money searching for new candidates and\ntrying to interest new people in your company, you can contact candidates who\nalready know your business and have shown interest in the past. Some providers\nuse AI technology to rediscover strong candidates who were interested in the\ncompany earlier and could be suitable for a new role. The ranking may also\ninclude promising profiles that have been forgotten for several months or\nyears.\n\n## **Selection of candidates**\n\nAnother interesting way to use AI in recruiting can be found in the selection\nprocess for a suitable candidate. Here we also see a shift towards\ncustomization of candidate experience. We say \u201calso,\u201d since this individual\nelement is what we see in different HR areas. A good example is employee\nlearning and development (L&D;).\n\nLearning and development programs are becoming more and more personalized. Not\nonly in terms of the content of the programs, but also in the way information\nis delivered to employees (some prefer the computer version, others use their\nsmartphones, etc.). Now AI can be used to study potential preferences; in\nother words, it becomes possible to truly understand which vacancies and what\ninformation your potential candidates are interested in.\n\nThis allows you to track the behavior of candidates on your site, and then\nautomatically send them personalized content and messages based on their\ninterests.\n\n_**Learn More:**_[How Blockchain Works for Employee\nVerification](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/how-blockchain-works-for-employee-verification/)\n\n## **ROI Calculations**\n\nFor a rough estimate, it is necessary to multiply the income of one employee\nby 40%. Your chief accountant will certainly agree that this is the way to\nestimate the incremental profitability of each new employee.\n\nExample: Suppose that the income per employee is $600,000. (For comparison,\nfor General Electrics this number is $400,000, and for Miscosoft, $700,000.)\nBy multiplying by 40%, we get that gross profit is $240,000. With a normal\ndistribution, 25% of the best employees on average bring 25% more profit, i.e.\n$300,000 per year.\n\nIf a recruiter with the help of AI manages to hire 30 people a year, the total\nprofit from these employees will be $7.2 million a year. If he or she hires 30\npeople who are among the top 25%, the profit will increase to $9 million, for\nan extra $1.8 million. Since this enterprise requires one-time investments,\nand the profit is constant, it is easy to calculate that the economic effect\nwill exceed 1000%.\n\nAs in the past year, the use of artificial intelligence will become even more\ncommon in the field of recruiting. Thus, if you have not used it already, it\ncan be a good time to start exploring various AI options that can help you\noptimize parts of the hiring process.\n\n_**Learn More:**_[4 Ways to Help Hourly Workers Prevent\nBurnout](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/health-medical/4-ways-to-\nhelp-hourly-workers-prevent-burnout/)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F3-ways-to-measure-the-roi-of-artificial-intelligence-for-\nrecruiting%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=3+Ways+to+Measure+the+ROI+of+Artificial+Intelligence+for+Recruiting\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=3+Ways+to+Measure+the+ROI+of+Artificial+Intelligence+for+Recruiting&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F3-ways-to-measure-the-roi-of-artificial-intelligence-for-\nrecruiting%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F3-ways-to-measure-the-roi-of-artificial-intelligence-for-\nrecruiting%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F3-ways-to-measure-the-roi-of-artificial-intelligence-for-\nrecruiting%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=3 Ways to Measure the ROI of Artificial\nIntelligence for\nRecruiting&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fdigital-\ntransformation%2F3-ways-to-measure-the-roi-of-artificial-intelligence-for-\nrecruiting%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Digital Transformation ](/category/digital-\ntransformation/ \"Digital Transformation\")\n\n  * [ ![Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/shutterstock_1134410339_5db306fad1860.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-special-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Halloween Special: Fears that Haunt HR about the Future of Work\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/halloween-\nspecial-fears-that-haunt-hr-about-the-future-of-work/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe future of work is uncertain, and the fear of AI taking over work is real.\nBut there\u2019s more to it, as expressed by some HR leaders we spoke to.\n\nby [Puja Lalwani](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/author/puja-\nlalwani-1/?zd_source=editors_pick) | Oct 25, 2019\n\n  * [ ![How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process \\(and How It Won\u2019t\\)](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/ai_in_recruitment_5da994c5c9d8b.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-and-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-wont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How AI Can and Will Affect the Recruiting Process (and How It Won\u2019t)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-ai-can-\nand-will-affect-the-recruiting-process-and-how-it-\nwont/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nWe hear a lot about AI\u2019s effect on jobs, but what about its effect on\nrecruiters?

Because HR is normally in charge of attracting, recruiting and retaining\nemployees within your organization, they are in a perfect position to\nimplement D&I trainings, programs, and initiatives. When ensuring that\norganizational leaders are emotionally intelligent, competent and effective in\ntheir roles, it often falls back on the HR team. With so much power to impact\nchange within an organization, HR plays a critical role in the organization\u2019s\nsuccess and sustainability. But often HR [falls\nshort](https://hbr.org/2012/07/why-hr-still-isnt-a-strategic-partner) in these\nefforts and more and more companies are finding that there is a lack of\nalignment between HR and effective D&I strategy. Popular media often\n[depicts](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/employee-\nrelations/pages/hr-on-tv-and-in-film.aspx) employees as having a love/hate\nrelationship with their company\u2019s HR department, with many employees having a\ncertain level of mistrust toward the department. The skepticism and doubt that\nmany have towards their HR department makes it more challenging to implement\nreal and effectual changes. In order to assess the effectiveness of your HR\ndepartment when implementing D&I efforts, it\u2019s crucial to first understand the\ndifferent ways that your HR department can actually impact positive changes as\nwell as some of the ways that your HR department may be impeding your\ncompany\u2019s D&I success.\n\n  1. **Lack of knowledge and understanding.** HR usually plays a key role when introducing and implementing D&I programs into the workplace. There is a lot of [research](https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail) that indicates D&I programs are ineffective for a number of different reasons. According to [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail), some best practices when implementing a D&I program are to \u201cengage managers in solving the problem, increase their on-the-job contact with female and minority workers, and promote social accountability.\u201d There may be a disconnect between current D&I practices and what is actually effective, but there is a wealth of free resources that can be used to close this gap. Employees should be aware of the mounting evidence that [indicates](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/) that diversity boosts creativity and innovation, which may incentivize skeptical employees who are resistant to D&I efforts. Is HR aware that by allowing employees more opportunities to connect with their coworkers from different backgrounds, that this may elicit the [contact hypothesis](https://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/prejudice/contact-hypothesis/), which posits that increased contact with different groups can decrease prejudice and bias? HR should have a thorough understanding of the research and best practices; this is a critical part of creating an effective D&I program.\n  2. **Lack of diverse sourcing methods.** Effective D&I management should include diverse methods to source job candidates. Targeted college recruitment efforts and diversifying the typical techniques used to find talented candidates can improve your D&I efforts. In addition to where candidates are sourced from, there may be bias in the ways that HR conducts selection procedures. The amount of years required for a role may [inadvertently bias](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/five-steps-improve-diversity-recruiting.aspx) a subset of your candidates, for example, so frequently re-assessing job requirements can prove beneficial. It\u2019s also important for HR not to rely too heavily on technology and algorithms in an attempt to source more diverse candidates. There is [evidence](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/hiring-tech-has-potential-but-beware-automation-bias.aspx) of algorithms being biased, so utilizing varied methods during the hiring and selection process is critical.\n\n  3. **Lack of objectivity in policies and procedures**. Another area where HR can drop the ball in D&I efforts is when evaluating current employees. HR should lay out clear and objective criteria for how each role will be assessed and what is necessary for pay increases and promotions. Transparency is critical. What often ends up happening is employees do not know or understand what measures they are being evaluated on. [Research](https://www.payscale.com/data/how-to-ask-for-a-raise) indicates that employers need to do a better job explaining to employees why their raise request was denied. In addition, this research indicates that the likelihood to quit is higher when there is ambiguity surrounding raise requirements. Some companies have decided to [display](https://open.buffer.com/salary-formula/) employee salaries online, which can be an effective way to build trust among employees. Starbucks decided to implement a [wage calculator](https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2016/starbucks-history-of-partner-benefits/) to help employees better understand what factors determine pay. HR should strive to be more candid regarding what measures factor into pay and promotion and more objectivity is required regarding the execution of different policies and procedures.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/drjanicegassam) or\n[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/janicegassamphd/).

some of Google's best practices to address considerations unique to\nAI and machine learning.\n\nBy: [Michael J. O'Brien](https://hrexecutive.com/author/mike-obrien/ \"Posts by\nMichael J. O'Brien\") | October 2, 2019 \u2022 2 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [HR\nTechnology Conference News](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-\ntechnology-conference/) | [Top Stories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-\nstories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HR-\nTechnology-1585-crowd-day-one-700x467.jpg)\n\nHuman Resource Executive's HR Technology conference at the Venetian wrapped up\nFriday in Las Vegas. (Photo by Isaac Brekken for Human Resource Executive)\n\nWhenever Google uses artificial intelligence in any of its products or\nprojects, it adheres to seven principles, according to Dmitri Krakovsky, a\nvice president at Google.\n\nOne of the most important ones, he said during a session titled [\"Learning to\nWork with AI In\nRecruiting\"](https://s23.a2zinc.net/clients/lrp/hrtechnologyconference2019/Public/SessionDetails.aspx?FromPage=Sessions.aspx&SessionID=5134&SessionDateID=184)\nat the HR Tech Conference, is #2: Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias.\n\n[**SUBSCRIBE here to receive our daily\nemails.**](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-technology-\nconference/)\n\nAs the concepts of bias and inclusivity take on more importance in the world\nof recruiting, Krakovsky said, machine learning can play a role in reducing\nthose negative outcomes for workers-for better or worse.\n\n\"As we are solving problem of people finding jobs and jobs finding people,\" he\nsaid, \"it's very important to think about bias, fairness and inclusion and how\nalgorithms can actually enforce bias or make other problems worse.\"\n\n**HR Tech 2019:[Follow our up-to-the-minute coverage\nhere.](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-technology-\nconference/)**\n\nIndeed, while we may think of machine learning as an inherently unbiased\nprocess, he said, \"even without any malice or bad intent, there's many\nopportunities for creating biases,\" including reporting bias, sampling bias,\nlatent bias and interaction bias.\n\nSo when companies create their own data sets and models to improve their\nrecruiting process, it's important they collect diverse data to ensure they\nwill be truly representative.\n\n**Popular today:[How agile innovated Walmart\u2019s\nhiring](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-how-agile-innovated-walmarts-\nhiring/)**\n\n\"The sets of data you are training on need to be based on the problem you're\ntrying to solve,\" he said. \"If you're trying to solve specific things, you\nneed specific data. Otherwise the model won't learn.\"\n\nKrakovsky also said companies should \"proactively\" try to break their models.\n\n\"Can you trick the model into producing unfair outcomes? How do you fix these\nscenarios?\"\n\nBy getting AI models right, Krakovsky said, organizations will \"have the\npotential to be transformational in promoting inclusivity and diversity in\nrecruitment.\"\n\nMichael J.

But a specific job\nlike an HR manager requires more curated questions to make sure the\nprospective employee actually fits in with the rest of the team.\n\n[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/hr-manager-interview-questions/)\nrecently shared a list of interview questions that are useful when you are\nconsidering hiring an HR manager or promoting one. These questions help\nidentify the strongest candidate who possesses the necessary skills and\nattributes to excel in the position.\n\nPrepare some of these before you go on meeting the next candidate.\n\n**1\\. What is your management style?**\n\nEvery person has their individual management style. That said, depending on\nhow flexible your company allows, the perfect candidate should be able to\ncommunicate openness to the established style in your company. After all, the\nlast thing you need is someone who bucks the system without proper\njustification.\n\n**2\\. As an HR manager, how will you drive results?**\n\nMore and more leaders are expecting HR to come up with initiatives to drive\nbusiness results. This question allows you to better understand the value the\ncandidate could bring to your company.\n\n**3\\. What do you like least about the world of human resources?**\n\nThis question allows you to get to know more about the candidate\u2019s preference.\nIt is a red flag if the candidate flat out says they hate certain part of the\njob and gives no explanation.\n\n**4\\. Describe an ideal workplace for you.**\n\nThis question serves two purposes. First, you get to see if the candidate will\nbe a good fit with your company\u2019s culture. Second, the candidate\u2019s answer may\nbring some insights on how to shape the company to be a better workplace.\n\n**5\\. As an HR person, what is your view on job eliminations?**\n\nLayoffs and firing are difficult but also inevitable parts in the HR field. By\nasking this question, you can see what aspects and factors the candidate would\nconsider before resorting to eliminations. For example, a performance\nimprovement plan could be an alternative as suggested in the article. The\nquestion will also reveal whether the candidate has the essential\ncommunication skills when breaking bad news or making difficult decisions.\n\n**6\\. Describe a difficult experience you had with an\nemployer/manager/coworker and how you handled it.**\n\nWhile you may think this is just another common interview question, this one\nis especially important for the role in HR as it illustrates how well the\ncandidate handles conflicts, which is one of the most important parts of the\njob.\n\n**7\\. Tell me about a time when you didn\u2019t follow policy or had to deviate\nfrom policy.**\n\nWhile rules and policies are extremely important in any company, there are\ntimes that management needs to be flexible. This question sheds lights on\ntheir values, judgement and agility, but of course, it needs to be supported\nwith sound reasons.\n\n**8\\. How do you deal with an unethical situation? Any examples?**\n\nHR plays a crucial part in safeguarding ethical practices. This question\nallows you to know if the candidate has what it takes to be a component HR\nmanager. If you have time, prepare a scenario in case the candidate doesn\u2019t\nhave a relevant, first-hand experience to share, which is possible.\n\n**9\\. What questions would you ask me if you were the interviewer?**\n\nBy asking this question, you will see if the candidate has the technical\nknowhow in recruiting. Also, the answer given shows how well the candidate\nunderstands the specific needs of your company. For example, if your company\nhas been making effort in going more data-driven, well prepared candidates\nwill be able to ask questions like what experience the candidate has with\nreporting and analytics.\n\n**10\\. What trends will shape Human Resource departments over the next five\nyears?**\n\nAn experienced HR practitioner should be ready to talk about the low-down on\nthe industry.

McCulloch\") on 29 Aug 2019 in [Candidate\nexperience](https://www.personneltoday.com/recruitment-retention/candidate-\nexperience/), [Latest News](https://www.personneltoday.com/ct/latest-news/),\n[Employer branding](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr-strategy/employer-\nbranding/), [Graduates](https://www.personneltoday.com/recruitment-\nretention/graduates/), [Recruitment &\nretention](https://www.personneltoday.com/recruitment-retention/),\n[Recruitment of young people](https://www.personneltoday.com/recruitment-\nretention/recruitment-of-young-people/), [Selection\ninterviews](https://www.personneltoday.com/recruitment-retention/selection-\ninterviews/)\n\n![Job interview](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2013/11/rexfeatures_3310052a_candidate_experience_job_interview.jpg)\n\nREX/Caiaimage\n\n**Research into recruitment experiences has underlined the potential damage\ncaused to brands by negative processes. These might include failure to provide\nfeedback and to acknowledge receipt of the application.**\n\nThe research by Reed UK also found major discrepancies between candidate\nexpectations and companies' handling of the process. Two-thirds of applicants\n(69%) expect feedback if unsuccessful at interview stage yet only 8%\nconsistently receive feedback. About one third (35%) rarely or have never\ngained any comments on their application.\n\n## Candidate feedback\n\n[**How inviting feedback can drive a positive candidate\nexperience**](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/inviting-feedback-candidate-\nexperience/)\n\n[**What are Glassdoor 's reviews really telling\nus?**](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/what-are-glassdoors-reviews-really-\ntelling-us/)\n\n**[Slow feedback putting off job\napplicants](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/lengthy-hiring-practices-slow-\nfeedback-putting-applicants/)**\n\nReed's study claimed that 73% of job seekers would be less likely to use the\nproducts or services of a company with which they had a poor hiring\nexperience. This was particularly true of younger candidates (under 35s), of\nwhom 50% said they would share their negative experiences with others.\n\nThree-quarters of job seekers expect to receive confirmation that their\napplication has been received, rising to 84% for those earning \u00a350,000 or\nmore. A significant proportion (39%) expected to receive this confirmation\nwithin 24 hours and 68% expected it within three days.\n\nGiven success at the screening stage, 73% of applicants expected to be\ninterviewed within a fortnight of making their application while nearly all\ncandidates (91%) believed that businesses should be in a position to offer\nthem a job within three weeks of the initial application.\n\nNeil Millett, research and events manager at Reed, linked the high\nexpectations of applicants with the rise of consumer use of online services,\nwhether it was in banking or retail.\n\nHe added: \u201cBut it's bad news for brands who fail to meet these expectations,\nparticularly with younger jobseekers, as they\u2019re more inclined to share their\nnegative experiences with family and friends. Additionally, the majority of\nthose we surveyed would even be less likely to use the brand\u2019s services in the\nfuture. Clearly, this highlights the importance of companies having a sleek\nhiring process.\u201d\n\nThe online survey conducted by Atomic Research was of 4,002 full and part-time\nUK workers.\n\n[Previous

Qpage sees this as an opportunity and wants to shake the market with\nits comprehensive solution.\n\n## Human Resource Management Technology\n\nThere are various methods for managing people management functions, each\nproposing a different type of solution. The three most common are the Human\nResources Information System (HRIS), Human Capital Management (HCM) and the\nApplicant Tracking System (ATS).\n\nThe HR information system is related to managing the day-to-day affairs of the\ncompany such as viewing staff profiles, requesting leave, uploading legal\ndocuments. The human capital management system is additionally offering the\nlist of employees' salaries. Process supervision for acquiring and hiring also\nhelps businesses manage staff appraisal performance management.\n\nThe applicant tracking system is a software application that enables the\nelectronic handling of recruitment, hiring automation, applicant scoring\nsystem, and on-boarding. An ATS can be implemented or accessed online at the\nenterprise- or small-business levels, depending on the needs of the\norganization; free and open-source ATS software is also available.\n\nSubscribe to TechRasa's mailing list\n\nCompanies, such as [Bamboohr](https://www.bamboohr.com/),\n[Gusto](https://gusto.com/), and [Paycor ](https://www.paycor.com/)are some of\nthe well-known software tools available in the field of HR. Applicant process\nmanagement also includes [SmartRecruiters](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/),\n[Workable ](https://www.workable.com/)and [Lever\n](https://www.lever.co/)software.\n\n## The Founders\n\n![](http://techrasa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/founders-1024x654.jpg)from\nleft to right, Aram Jafari, Pouya Lotfi, Farhad Jafari\n\n**[Pouya Lotfi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pouya-\nlotfi-70531236/?originalSubdomain=ee)** , the Co-founder and CEO of Qpage, was\nborn in 1984. He completed his undergraduate degree in Business Administration\nfrom the University of Tehran. He holds a Master\u2019s Degree in Business\nAdministration (MBA) Aalto School of business, Finland. Pouya has the\nexperience of working with companies such as LG Electronics as senior business\nUnit Manager, Entekhab Industrial Group as Business Unit Director, and Pars\nOnline as an entrepreneur in house. He also has startup experiences being a\nco-founder and CEO at Reyhoon.com, and held positions in Bamilo.com Iranian\nleading marketplace at the time as CEO and Chief Operating Officer at the same\ntime.\n\n**[Aram Jafari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aram-jafari-b1826655/)** is\nanother co-founder of [Qpage ](https://www.qpage.one/)who works in the field\nof artificial intelligence. He holds a Bachelor of Computer Software\nEngineering from the University of Science and Culture and a Master\u2019s Degree\nin Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations from Kharazmi University. He\nhas been dedicated to science and business analysis at Reyhoon, Bamilo, and\nSnapp companies.\n\n**[Farhad Jafari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farhad-jafari/)** , Chief\nDesigner of Qpage, is born in 1987. He is an undergraduate in computer\nsoftware engineering from Islamic Azad University. Farhad was a UX consultant\nat Yara, Mabna, and Netap, who also collaborates with DigiKala, Bamilo, Alonak\nand Mellat\u2019s Beh-Pardakht in the field of User Experience and product design.\n\n## The starting of the business\n\nThe idea for Qpage comes to Pouya\u2019s mind in March 2019, and he shares the idea\nwith Ali two months later. In May, he planned to migrate abroad to meet an\nangel investor. After agreeing with him, they start working with Ali and Aram\nand Farhad join them in June.\n\nThey initially locate their startup in the Tivan collaborative workspace and,\nafter a month, they rent a new office that currently houses a team of 16\npeople. After six months of operation, Qpage was released in January. Also,\nchoosing the name of Qpage comes from Quick Page module based SaaS.\n\n## Problems, inefficiencies, and outdated solutions\n\nIn Iran, HRM processes are performed manually and at best on spreadsheet\nsoftware such as Excel. For this reason, there is no integration between the\ndifferent parts of the process. To date, in Iran, only the part of recruitment\nsites has become online and have attracted the attention of businesses.\n\nExisting solutions for human resource management around the world are outdated\nand inappropriate for new business mechanisms. Workforce planning, job\ndescriptions, job posting, job searches, recruiting potential candidates,\ninterviewing, hiring, onboarding, and staff evaluation for HR and other staff\nis a very difficult process. Existing solutions do not meet the needs of\nbusinesses in all of these sectors.\n\nAlso, none of the solutions work automatically and are mostly used to solve\nproblems 5 years ago. For example, there is only one fixed and specific\nprocess for the hiring process that does not meet all the needs of businesses.\nIt also does not have a good user interface and artificial intelligence does\nnot interfere with their process automation.\n\nPlatforms are analyzed and evaluated by platforms through common behavioral\ntests that are partially responsive. The judgment of the interviewer is also\ninfluential in the judgment of individuals because there is no set standard\nand the individual acts according to his or her reasoning. Judgments should be\nbased on company standards, not personal standards.\n\nOne of the big problems for job seekers is completing different resumes in\ndifferent places. This causes frustration for the employer because of the lack\nof standard resumes. Also, after the end of the face-to-face interview, the\nbusiness usually does not announce the final response for various reasons.\n\nThough the applicant got no clue on what process and stages they are in, where\nit takes a hefty amount of efforts for recruiters to inform them all.\n\n## The solution is a comprehensive human resource management platform\n\nthe first step, Qpage has been able to cover all the recruitment steps and\nprocesses required for pre and post-hiring on an online platform. Meanwhile,\nall processes are flexible and businesses can customize it according to their\nflows. Qpage also integrates with recruitment sites, automating the process of\nhiring ads, receiving resumes, reviewing resumes and filtering them.\n\nThe Qpage \u200b\u200bplatform has been able to automate a large amount of demanding\ntasks with the help of artificial intelligence to reduce the workloads of HR\nand recruiting professionals. Besides, this platform is the canvas of the\ninterviewers with the help of artificial intelligence and data mining during\nthe interview and judge phase.\n\n### Resume with a single photo\n\nThis startup also helps job seekers to easily present their resume to\nemployers. It also automatically puts the employee in the hiring process and\nnotifies him/her of the final response after the business is finally declared.\n\n### Proposed Value, Human Resources Total System (HRTS)\n\nQpage is a solution to facilitate communication between the job-seeker,\nemployee, recruiter, and employer. Despite the platform\u2019s simplicity, it\nintegrates the hiring process for both the employer and the employer, so that\nthey don\u2019t get confused on different platforms. In other words, Qpage is a\ncomprehensive talent management system.\n\nPouya defines the value of the Qpage as follows:\n\n> We want to be a human resources management operating system for small and\n> medium-sized businesses. Also, as we simplify this area, we can get people\n> out of the dryness and lifelessness of recruitment processes and cut costs.\n\n## The product\n\nThe original product offered by Qpage is more capable than its external\ncompetitors, such as Lever, breezy Warehouse and even Workable. According to\nPouya:\n\n> We can't say we released the Minimum Acceptable Product (MVP); because this\n> version of Qpage is the Minimum sellable Product.\n\n## Workforce planning\n\nQpage helps businesses to easily embed their organizational charts into the\nplatform. They can then simply identify their vacancies at the time of hiring\nto decide on whether to recruit or not.\n\n![Organizational chart in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u0686\u0627\u0631\u062a-\u0633\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc-En-1024x522.jpg)Organizational chart\n\n## Job Description\n\nThere can be two types of writing job descriptions in Qpage. When intending to\nhire a regular position, only the three characteristics of the **position** ,\n**responsibilities** and **salary and benefits** are defined. In the advanced\ncase, adding to the aforementioned, the **required capabilities** ,\n**evaluation approach** and any other factors that are demanded by the\nbusiness will be defined in the platform.\n\n![Job description in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u0634\u0631\u062d-En-857x1024.jpg)Job description\n\n**Job description standardization** allows businesses to simply post their\nrecruitment ad across all recruitment sites by a single click. Businesses can\nalso publish a standard job description form on their social networks by\nconnecting them to Qpage.\n\n## Integration with recruitment sites and easy filtering\n\nDue to the definition of a standard online job description, candidates can be\neasily classified and filtered according to the organization\u2019s needs, and then\nbe interviewed in order of priority. If more information is required, the two\nparties can communicate with each other on the platform, in real-time.\n\n![categorizing and filtering the resume in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u0641\u06cc\u0644\u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u06af-\u0622\u0633\u0627\u0646-En-1024x517.jpg)categorizing and\nfiltering the resume\n\nPersonnel within the company who are eager for a job promotion or transfer\nwithin the organization can easily access job opportunities through the Qpage\nplatform. Managers in each department can also store potential candidates that\nthere is a possibility of future cooperation with to refer to them at the\nright time.\n\n### Qualification\n\nIn addition to **the scoring of job interviewers** , Qpage helps employers\nprocess fair scoring concerning candidate\u2019s resume and **personality,\nbehavioral and voice tests**. This reduces the effect of the interviewer's\npersonal feelings on the judgment of individuals. Finally, all the items\nlisted in the job-seekers profile are displayed to the final decision-maker.\n\n### Telephone, video and in-person interviews\n\nIn addition to a question-and-answer list for the initial review that is being\nsent to the job seeker, Qpage will be able to arrange telephone and in-person\ninterviews. This platform can also help in outsourcing the interview phase if\nneeded by businesses. In both cases, the job-seekers can receive points and\nthe interviewer's opinion is included in their interview form.\n\n![Flexible job interview process in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u062c\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646-\u0645\u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628\u0647-En-1024x465.jpg)Flexible job interview\nprocess\n\nIt is also possible to designate several people for the interview, in which\ncase the interviewer's rating and comments are recorded in the profile of each\njob-seeker. Emotional and behavioral analysis of the job with the help of\nartificial intelligence in the interview is also done by Qpage. That is, in\naddition to examining one's personality traits, one can test how judgment,\ndecision making, power of logic, tone of voice and so on are.\n\n![Selection of interviewer team in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u062a\u06cc\u0645-\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0627\u0645-En-1024x469.jpg)Selection of interviewer\nteam\n\n### The stages of organizational adoption\n\nThis platform helps new employees get to know their company within the first\n100 days of their work. That is, the department manager briefs the individual\non his / her **responsibilities** by identifying several specific tasks that\nultimately lead to the accomplishment of a **mission**. It also provides\nstatistics on the number of employees, the recruitment process, ongoing\ninterviews, employee leave, vacancies, and so on.\n\n![onboarding process in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062d\u0644-\u067e\u0630\u06cc\u0631\u0634-\u0633\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc-En-1024x430.jpg)onboarding process\n\nAfter completing each task, the designated individuals can rate the new\nemployee to determine their performance. Besides, if new employees need\nassistance, they can provide it through the platform and arrange in-person\nmeetings if needed.\n\n### In-company team building\n\nOrganization members can form different teams to communicate with each other.\nThis feature helps new employees find their place in the organization more\neasily and get to know people. It is also useful for the recruitment process\nthat requires multiple decision-makers.\n\n![In-company team building in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u062a\u06cc\u0645-\u0633\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646-En-1024x514.jpg)In-company team building\n\n### Online Resume\n\nTo prepare a resume, it is only necessary for the job-seeker to send a PDF of\nhis / her resume so that the Qpage can create a profile ready for him/her\nusing artificial intelligence. The accuracy of parsing and analyzing of the\nresumes is 85% in Qpage. After submitting the resume, the initial analysis\nwill be carried out on it and be sent to the eligible employers.\n\nThis feature helps Qpage to show the ratings and comments of all the\ninterviewers in the profile of the person so that the employer can make a\ncomfortable decision.\n\n### Income model, Freemium\n\nThe earnings model is Freemium. The features listed in the product section\nwill be provided for free and users will be paying a membership fee for\nadvanced tools and features that will be released in the future.\n\n### Market size, 500 million SMEs\n\nQpage\u2019s main customers are particularly medium and large businesses (SMEs) and\nstartups. The number of these businesses in the world is estimated at 500\nmillion. It is estimated that this market will reach $ 65 billion by the year\n2025.\n\n### Competitors and Partners\n\nPouya expresses his view on their global competitors in the following:\n\n> In the global marketplace, platforms like Workable and Lever are our main\n> competitors. With 15 years of experience, Workable has cooperated with 5,000\n> businesses and is valued at $ 700 million. The 15-year-old Workable has much\n> fewer features than the first version of the Qpage. Lever is our other\n> competitor. It has been operating for nearly eight years and has raised $ 75\n> million in the capital. Lever has only 20% of the benefits which the first\n> version of the Qpage offers.\n\nIn the Iranian market, platforms such as [Adilar ](https://adilar.com/)and\n[Civito ](https://civito.co/)are also competitors to Qpage.\n\nRecruitment sites are the most important business partner of this platform.\nQpage needs a large number of job-seekers to complete its hiring process.\nRecruitment sites like Glassdoor and [Linkedin ](https://www.linkedin.com/)can\nhelp this platform get access to job seekers\u2019 resumes.\n\n### Vision, solution for job-seeker, recruiter, employee and employer\nrelations\n\nPouya: \"If we can meet all the needs of the four segments of the job-seeker,\nrecruiter, employee, and employer and satisfy them, then the good experience\nthey have in the platform will help us complete our supply chain. I think in\nthe next five years we will be able to provide a comprehensive human resource\nmanagement solution. \"\n\n### Online assessments\n\nOne of the main problems of the interview is the influence of the\ninterviewer\u2019s logic and feeling on the decision making. In addition to the\nexisting tests, QPage plans to incorporate the online job-seeker into its\nplatform. For example, if a programmer is hired, a test will be put on the\nplatform by the hiring organization's programming team to test the job-seeker.\n\n### Sharing interview results\n\nIf the job-seeker agrees, the results of his interviews will be shared with\nall employers. In doing so, the platform would be additionally reducing the\ncomplexity of the decision-making process in the recruitment process, as well\nas the interview time and providing the employer with more comprehensive\ninformation about the candidate.\n\n### Crow-sourcing interview\n\nShifting to crowd capabilities will ease the recruitment process particularly\nonce a new expertise requires to be joint to the team.\n\n### Managing staff performance\n\nIn the future, with the ability to evaluate the performance of existing staff\nin the organization, this platform will accommodate HR management from A to Z.\n\n### Challenges\n\nTo provide a comprehensive solution, Qpage needs to get **APIs from recruiting\nsites** , which can be a great challenge to work with them.\n\nTo date, only recruitment sites have been the focus of business in Iran.\n**Businesses ' unfamiliarity with HRM technology** makes it difficult for\nQpage to adapt them to this platform. Also, the membership fee payment model\nis not commonly accepted in Iran yet.\n\nThe hiring process alone has many complexities that make people run away from\nit. Qpage aims to cover the whole hiring process and its pre and post\nprocedures. It is very difficult to assemble different capabilities into one\nproduct, as it can confuse HR managers, employers and job seekers.\n\nAll in all, QPage is targeting Nordic and North America market, while offering\na lifelong freemium model for Iranian SMEs as well. Will see more on their\nprogress in near future.\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [ATS](http://techrasa.com/tag/ats/)\n  * [HCM](http://techrasa.com/tag/hcm/)\n  * [HRIS](http://techrasa.com/tag/hris/)\n  * [Human Resources](http://techrasa.com/tag/human-resources/)\n  * [Qpage](http://techrasa.com/tag/qpage/)\n\nSHARE\n\n[__Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftechrasa.com%2F2020%2F02%2F10%2Fqpage-\na-comprehensive-human-resources-management-solution-2%2F)\n[__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Qpage%2C+a+comprehensive+human+resources+management+solution&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftechrasa.com%2F2020%2F02%2F10%2Fqpage-\na-comprehensive-human-resources-management-solution-2%2F&via=techrasacom)\n[__](http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://techrasa.com/2020/02/10/qpage-a-\ncomprehensive-human-resources-management-\nsolution-2/)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://techrasa.com/2020/02/10/qpage-\na-comprehensive-human-resources-management-\nsolution-2/)[__](http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://techrasa.com/2020/02/10/qpage-\na-comprehensive-human-resources-management-\nsolution-2/&media=http://techrasa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Qpage-a-\ncomprehensive-human-resources-management-solution.jpg&description=Existing\nsolutions for human resource management around the world are outdated.

More than 100\nemployers now use the system, including\n[Hilton](https://jobs.hilton.com/select-country.php) and\n[Unilever](https://www.unilever.com/careers/), and more than a million job\nseekers have been analyzed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut some AI researchers argue the system is digital snake oil \u2014 an unfounded\nblend of superficial measurements and arbitrary number-crunching that is not\nrooted in scientific fact. Analyzing a human being like this, they argue,\ncould end up penalizing nonnative speakers, visibly nervous interviewees or\nanyone else who doesn\u2019t fit the model for look and speech.\n\nThe system, they argue, will assume a critical role in helping decide a\nperson\u2019s career. But they doubt it even knows what it\u2019s looking for: Just what\ndoes the perfect employee look and sound like, anyway?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a profoundly disturbing development that we have proprietary technology\nthat claims to differentiate between a productive worker and a worker who\nisn\u2019t fit, based on their facial movements, their tone of voice, their\nmannerisms,\u201d said Meredith Whittaker, a co-founder of the [AI Now\nInstitute](https://ainowinstitute.org/), a research center in New York.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pseudoscience. It\u2019s a license to discriminate,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd the\npeople whose lives and opportunities are literally being shaped by these\nsystems don\u2019t have any chance to weigh in.\u201d\n\n[Update: Prominent rights group files federal complaint against AI-hiring firm\nHireVue, citing \u201cunfair and deceptive\u201d\npractices](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/06/prominent-\nrights-group-files-federal-complaint-against-ai-hiring-firm-hirevue-citing-\nunfair-deceptive-\npractices/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_13&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_13)\n\nLoren Larsen, HireVue\u2019s chief technology officer, said that such criticism is\nuninformed and that \u201cmost AI researchers have a limited understanding\u201d of the\npsychology behind how workers think and behave.\n\nLarsen compared algorithms\u2019 ability to boost hiring outcomes with medicine\u2019s\nimprovement of health outcomes and said the science backed him up. The system,\nhe argued, is still more objective than the flawed metrics used by human\nrecruiters, whose thinking he called the \u201cultimate black box.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople are rejected all the time based on how they look, their shoes, how\nthey tucked in their shirts and how \u2018hot\u2019 they are,\u201d he told The Washington\nPost. \u201cAlgorithms eliminate most of that in a way that hasn\u2019t been possible\nbefore.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe AI, he said, doesn\u2019t explain its decisions or give candidates their\nassessment scores, which he called \u201cnot relevant.\u201d But it is \u201cnot logical,\u201d he\nsaid, to assume some people might be unfairly eliminated by the automated\njudge.\n\n\u201cWhen 1,000 people apply for one job,\u201d he said, \u201c999 people are going to get\nrejected, whether a company uses AI or not.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a prominent rights group, the Electronic Privacy Information\nCenter, filed an [official\ncomplaint](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/06/prominent-\nrights-group-files-federal-complaint-against-ai-hiring-firm-hirevue-citing-\nunfair-deceptive-practices/?tid=lk_inline_manual_21&itid=lk_inline_manual_21)\nurging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate HireVue for \u201cunfair and\ndeceptive\u201d practices. The system\u2019s \u201cbiased, unprovable and not replicable\"\nresults, EPIC officials wrote, constitute a major threat to American workers\u2019\nprivacy and livelihoods.\n\nAD\n\n[Listen on Post Reports: Reporters Drew Harwell and Carolyn Y. Johnson on the\nrise of AI and the risks of bias that come with\nit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/an-interview-with-an-\nalgorithm/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_23&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_23)\n\nThe inscrutable algorithms have forced job seekers to confront a new kind of\ninterview anxiety. Nicolette Vartuli, a University of Connecticut senior\nstudying math and economics with a 3.5 GPA, said she researched HireVue and\ndid her best to dazzle the job-interview machine. She answered confidently and\nin the time allotted. She used positive keywords. She smiled, often and wide.\n\nAD\n\nBut when she didn\u2019t get the investment banking job, she couldn\u2019t see how the\ncomputer had rated her or ask how she could improve, and she agonized over\nwhat she had missed. Had she not looked friendly enough? Did she talk too\nloudly? What did the AI hiring system believe she had gotten wrong?\n\n\u201cI feel like that\u2019s maybe one of the reasons I didn\u2019t get it: I spoke a little\ntoo naturally,\u201d Vartuli said. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t use enough big, fancy words. I\nused \u2018conglomerate\u2019 one time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHireVue said its system dissects the tiniest details of candidates\u2019 responses\n\u2014 their facial expressions, their eye contact and perceived \u201centhusiasm\u201d \u2014 and\ncompiles reports companies can use in deciding whom to hire or disregard.\n\nJob candidates aren\u2019t told their score or what little things they got wrong,\nand they can\u2019t ask the machine what they could do better. Human hiring\nmanagers can use other factors, beyond the HireVue score, to decide which\ncandidates pass the first-round test.\n\nAD\n\nThe system, HireVue said, employs superhuman precision and impartiality to\nzero in on an ideal employee, picking up on telltale clues a recruiter might\nmiss.\n\nMajor employers with lots of high-volume, entry-level openings are\nincreasingly turning to such automated systems to help find candidates, assess\nr\u00e9sum\u00e9s and streamline hiring. The Silicon Valley start-up AllyO, for\ninstance, advertises a \u201crecruiting automation bot\u201d that can text-message a\ncandidate, \u201cAre you willing to relocate?\u201d And a HireVue competitor, the\n\u201cdigital recruiter\u201d VCV, offers a similar system for use in phone interviews,\nduring which a candidate\u2019s voice and answers are analyzed by an \u201cautomated\nscreening\u201d machine.\n\nAD\n\nBut HireVue\u2019s prospects have cemented it as the leading player in the brave\nnew world of semi-automated corporate recruiting. It says it can save\nemployers a fortune on in-person interviews and quickly cull applicants deemed\nsubpar. HireVue says it also allows companies to see candidates from an\nexpanded hiring pool: Anyone with a phone and Internet connection can apply.\n\nAD\n\nNathan Mondragon, HireVue\u2019s chief industrial-organizational psychologist, told\nThe Post the standard 30-minute HireVue assessment includes half a dozen\nquestions but can yield up to 500,000 data points, all of which become\ningredients in the person\u2019s calculated score.\n\nThe employer decides the written questions, which HireVue\u2019s system then shows\nthe candidate while recording and analyzing their responses. The AI assesses\nhow a person\u2019s face moves to determine, for instance, how excited someone\nseems about a certain work task or how they would behave around angry\ncustomers. Those \u201cFacial Action Units,\u201d Mondragon said, can make up 29 percent\nof a person\u2019s score; the words they say and the \u201caudio features\u201d of their\nvoice, like their tone, make up the rest.\n\nAD\n\n[Wanted: The \u2018perfect babysitter.\u2019 Must pass AI scan for respect and\nattitude.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/16/wanted-\nperfect-babysitter-must-pass-ai-scan-respect-\nattitude/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_41&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_41)\n\n\u201cHumans are inconsistent by nature. They inject their subjectivity into the\nevaluations,\u201d Mondragon said. \u201cBut AI can database what the human processes in\nan interview, without bias. \u2026 And humans are now believing in machine\ndecisions over human feedback.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTo train the system on what to look for and tailor the test to a specific job,\nthe employer\u2019s current workers filling the same job \u2014 \u201cthe entire spectrum,\nfrom high to low achievers\u201d \u2014 sit through the AI assessment, Larsen said.\n\nTheir responses, Larsen said, are then matched with a \u201cbenchmark of success\u201d\nfrom those workers\u2019 past job performance, like how well they had met their\nsales quotas and how quickly they had resolved customer calls. The best\ncandidates, in other words, end up looking and sounding like the employees who\nhad done well before the prospective hires had even applied.\n\nAD\n\nAfter a new candidate takes the HireVue test, the system generates a report\ncard on their \u201ccompetencies and behaviors,\u201d including their \u201cwillingness to\nlearn,\u201d \u201cconscientiousness & responsibility\u201d and \u201cpersonal stability,\u201d the\nlatter of which is defined by how well they can cope with \u201cirritable customers\nor co-workers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThose computer-estimated personality traits are then used to group candidates\ninto high, medium and low tiers based on their \u201clikelihood of success.\u201d\nEmployers can still pursue candidates ranked in the bottom tier, but several\ninterviewed by The Post said they mostly focused on the ones the computer\nsystem liked best.\n\n[The new way your boss can tell if you\u2019re about to quit your\njob](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/04/11/new-way-your-boss-can-\ntell-if-youre-about-quit-your-\njob/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_50&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_50)\n\nHireVue offers only the most limited peek into its interview algorithms, both\nto protect its trade secrets and because the company doesn\u2019t always know how\nthe system decides on who gets labeled a \u201cfuture top performer.\u201d\n\nThe company has given only vague explanations when defining which words or\nbehaviors offer the best results. For a call center job, the company says,\n\u201csupportive\u201d words might be encouraged, while \u201caggressive\u201d ones might sink\none\u2019s score.\n\nHireVue said its board of expert advisers regularly reviews its algorithmic\napproach, but the company declined to make the system available for an\nindependent audit. The company, Larsen said, is \u201cexploring the use of an\nindependent auditor right now, to see how that could work.\u201d\n\nHireVue launched its AI assessment service in 2014 as an add-on to its video-\ninterview software, which more than 700 companies have used for nearly 12\nmillion interviews worldwide. The Utah-based company won\u2019t disclose its\nrevenue, the cost for employers or a full list of clients.\n\nThe company said last month that the private-equity giant [Carlyle\nGroup](https://www.carlyle.com/) would become its new majority investor,\nproviding an undisclosed sum from an $18.5 billion fund. Patrick McCarter, a\nmanaging director at the investment firm \u2014 which uses HireVue\u2019s video\ninterviews internally and said it \u201cwill look to deploy AI-driven candidate\nassessments over time\u201d \u2014 said the money would help the company expand to more\nemployers and more specialized job openings, both in the United States and\naround the world.\n\nAt the hotel giant Hilton International, thousands of applicants for\nreservation-booking, revenue management and call center positions have gone\nthrough HireVue\u2019s AI system, and executives credit the automated interviews\nwith shrinking their average hiring time from six weeks to five days.\n\nSarah Smart, the company\u2019s vice president of global recruitment, said the\nsystem has radically redrawn Hilton\u2019s hiring rituals, allowing the company to\nchurn through applicants at lightning speed. Hiring managers inundated with\napplicants can now just look at who the system ranked highly and filter out\nthe rest: \u201cIt\u2019s rare for a recruiter to need to go out of that range,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\nAt the consumer goods conglomerate Unilever, HireVue is credited with helping\nsave 100,000 hours of interviewing time and roughly $1 million in recruiting\ncosts a year. Leena Nair, the company\u2019s chief human resource officer, said the\nsystem had also helped steer managers away from hiring only \u201cmini-mes\u201d who\nlook and act just like them, boosting the company\u2019s \u201cdiversity hires,\u201d as she\ncalled them, by about 16 percent.\n\n\u201cThe more digital we become, the more human we become,\u201d she added.\n\nDane E. Holmes, the global head of human-capital management at HireVue client\nGoldman Sachs, [wrote](https://hbr.org/2019/05/recruiting) in the Harvard\nBusiness Review this spring that the banking giant\u2019s roughly 50,000 video-\ninterview recordings were \u201ca treasure trove of data that will help us conduct\ninsightful analyses.\"\n\nThe investment bank said it uses HireVue\u2019s video-interview system but not its\ncomputer-generated assessments. But Holmes said data from those videos could\nhelp the company figure out how candidates\u2019 skills and backgrounds might\ncorrespond to how well they would work or how long they would stay at the\nfirm. The company, he added, is also \u201cexperimenting with r\u00e9sum\u00e9-reading\nalgorithms\u201d that would help decide new hires\u2019 departments and tasks.\n\n\u201cCan I imagine a future in which companies rely exclusively on machines and\nalgorithms to rate r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and interviews? Maybe, for some,\u201d he wrote. (The\n\u201chuman element\u201d of recruiting, he pledged, would survive at Goldman Sachs.)\n\n[Is your pregnancy app sharing your intimate data with your\nboss?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/10/tracking-your-\npregnancy-an-app-may-be-more-public-than-you-\nthink/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_63&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_63)\n\nHireVue\u2019s expansion has also helped it win business from smaller groups such\nas [Re:work](https://www.reworktraining.org/), a Chicago nonprofit\norganization that trains unemployed local job seekers for careers in the tech\nindustry. Shelton Banks, the group\u2019s chief, said HireVue had proved to be an\nirreplaceable guide in assessing which candidates would be worth the effort.\n\nThe nonprofit organization once allowed almost anyone into its intensive\neight-week training program, but many burned out early. Now, every candidate\ngoes through the AI assessment first, which ranks them on problem-solving and\nnegotiation skills and helps the group determine who might have the most\nmotivation, curiosity and grit.\n\n\u201cKnowing where that person is at a starting place, when it comes to this\nperson\u2019s life,\u201d Banks said, \u201ccan help us make more accurate assessments of the\npeople we\u2019re saying yes or no to.\u201d\n\nBut Lisa Feldman Barrett, a neuroscientist who studies emotion, said she is\n\u201cstrongly skeptical\u201d that the system can really comprehend what it\u2019s looking\nat. She recently led a team of four senior scientists, including an expert in\n\u201ccomputer vision\u201d systems, in\n[assessing](https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/default+domain/10.1177%2F1529100619832930-FREE/full)\nmore than 1,000 published research papers studying whether the human face\nshows universal expressions of emotion and how well algorithms can understand\nthem.\n\nThe systems, they found, have become quite perceptive at detecting facial\nmovements \u2014 spotting the difference, say, between a smile and a frown. But\nthey\u2019re still worryingly imprecise in understanding what those movements\nactually mean and woefully unprepared for the vast cultural and social\ndistinctions in how people show emotion or personality.\n\nLook at scowling, Barrett said: A computer might see a person\u2019s frown and\nfurrowed brow and assume they\u2019re easily angered \u2014 a red flag for someone\nseeking a sales associate job. But people scowl all the time, she said, \u201cwhen\nthey\u2019re not angry: when they\u2019re concentrating really hard, when they\u2019re\nconfused, when they have gas.\u201d\n\nLuke Stark, a researcher at Microsoft\u2019s research lab in Montreal studying\nemotion and AI \u2014 who spoke as an individual, not as a Microsoft employee \u2014 was\nsimilarly skeptical of HireVue\u2019s ability to predict a worker\u2019s personality\nfrom their intonations and turns of phrase.\n\n[What happens when an algorithm labels you as mentally\nill?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/09/04/mental-\nhealth/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_71&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_71)\n\nSystems like HireVue, he said, have become quite skilled at spitting out data\npoints that seem convincing, even when they\u2019re not backed by science. And he\nfinds this \u201ccharisma of numbers\u201d really troubling because of the\noverconfidence employers might lend them while seeking to decide the path of\napplicants\u2019 careers.\n\nThe best AI systems today, he said, are notoriously prone to misunderstanding\nmeaning and intent. But he worried that even their perceived success at\ndivining a person\u2019s true worth could help perpetuate a \u201chomogenous\u201d corporate\nmonoculture of automatons, each new hire modeled after the last.\n\nThe company, HireVue\u2019s Larsen said, audits its performance data to look for\npotentially discriminatory hiring practices, known as adverse impacts, using\n\u201cworld-class bias testing\u201d techniques. The company\u2019s algorithms, he added,\nhave been trained \u201cusing the most deep and diverse data set of facial action\nunits available, which includes people from many countries and cultures.\u201d\n\nHireVue\u2019s growth, however, is running into some regulatory snags. In August,\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) signed [a first-in-the-nation\nlaw](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=101-0260)\nthat will force employers to tell job applicants how their AI-hiring system\nworks and get their consent before running them through the test. The measure,\nwhich HireVue said it supports, will take effect Jan. 1.\n\nState Rep. Jaime Andrade Jr. (D), who co-sponsored the bill, said he pushed\nthe transparency law after learning how many job applicants were rejected at\nthe AI stage of a job interview. He worried that spoken accents or cultural\ndifferences could end up improperly warping the results, and that people who\ndeclined to sit for the assessment could be unfairly punished by not being\nconsidered for the job.\n\n\u201cWhat is the model employee? Is it a white guy? A white woman? Someone who\nsmiles a lot?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are the data points being used?

Several said they\nrefused to do the interview outright because, in the words of one candidate,\nthe idea \u201cmade my skin crawl.\u201d\n\nCandidates said they have scrambled for ideas on how to maximize their\nworthiness before the algorithm\u2019s eye, turning to the hundreds of videos and\nonline handbooks suggesting, for instance, that they sit in front of a clean\nwhite wall, lest the background clutter dock their grade. \u201cGlue some googly\neyes to your webcam. It\u2019ll make it easier to maintain eye contact,\u201d one user\non the message board Reddit suggested.\n\nStark, the AI researcher, said these \u201cfolk theories of algorithms\u201d were a\nnatural response from people facing impenetrable AI systems with the power to\ndecide their fate. The survival techniques could feel reassuring, he said,\neven if they were wrong: Pick the right words, use the right tone, put on a\nsufficiently happy face. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of trying to give people confronting an\nopaque system they don\u2019t understand some feeling of agency,\u201d he said.\n\nBut some HireVue interviewees questioned whether it was fair or even smart to\njudge a person\u2019s workplace performance or personal abilities based on half an\nhour spent looking into a webcam.

The\nuniversity\u2019s economics department now offers a\n[guide](https://econ.duke.edu/sites/econ.duke.edu/files/file-\nattachments/Typical%20Questions%20from%20HireVue%20Interviews.pdf) to HireVue\ninterviews on its student resources\n[website](https://econ.duke.edu/dfe/student-resources), including typical\nquestions (\u201cWhat does integrity mean to you?\u201d) and behavioral tips (\u201cAct\nnatural, talk slowly!\u201d).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a new and untried way of communicating who they are that it adds to\ntheir anxiety,\u201d Rasiel said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an anxious generation, and now we\u2019re\nasking them to talk to a computer screen, answering questions to a camera \u2026\nwith no real guidelines on how to make themselves look better or worse.\u201d\n\nThe mysterious demands can also push people\u2019s angst into overdrive. When\nSheikh Ahmed, a 25-year-old in Queens, applied for teller jobs at banks around\nNew York, he said he received eight HireVue assessment offers, all scheduled\nfor the same day.\n\nHe studied guides on how to talk and act but found the hardest part was\nfiguring out the camera angle: Too high, he worried, and he would look\ndomineering; too low, and he would look shrunken and weak.\n\nBefore his marathon of AI interviews, he put on a crisp dress shirt, a tie and\npajama pants and went to his dad\u2019s soundproof music studio, away from the\nfamily\u2019s chirping society finch. He also turned off his air conditioning\nsystem, hoping the background noise wouldn\u2019t mess up his score.\n\nHe changed his answers slightly in each interview, in the hopes that the\nalgorithm would find something it liked. But he found it exhausting and\ndisheartening to boil down his life experience and worthiness into a computer-\nfriendly sound bite.\n\nBy the end, his mouth was dry, he was covered in sweat and he was paranoid he\nhadn\u2019t made enough eye contact while worrying about the bird. A few weeks\nafter the interviews, he said, he\u2019s still waiting to hear whether he got a\njob.\n\n _Correction: Due to incorrect information from Goldman Sachs, The Post\nmisreported in an earlier version of this story that the investment bank used\nHireVue\u2019s AI-driven assessment program. Goldman Sachs representatives said\nthey only use HireVue\u2019s video-interview system, not its automated\nassessments._\n\n0 Comments\n\n### Coronavirus Updates\n\nFollow the latest on the outbreak with our newsletter every weekday.

This is driving a new priority\nfor HR: one which requires leaders and teams to develop a fluency in\nartificial intelligence while they re-imagine HR to be more personal, human\nand intuitive.\n\nAs we enter 2019, it's the combination of AI and human intelligence that will\ntransform work and workers as we know it.\n\nI see the following ten HR trends leaders will need to prepare for as we enter\n2019:\n\n**1\\. AI Plus Human Intelligence Enhances the Candidate Experience**\n\nFor many companies the first pilots of artificial intelligence are in talent\nacquisition, as this is the area where companies see significant, measurable,\nand immediate results in reducing time to hire, increasing productivity for\nrecruiters, and delivering an enhanced candidate experience that is seamless,\nsimple, and intuitive.\n\nToday In: [Leadership Strategy](https://www.forbes.com/leadership-strategy)\n\n  * [\n\n### Judges Slap Down USCIS Again On H-1B Visas\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2020/04/08/judges-slap-down-\nuscis-again-on-h-1b-visas/)\n\n  * [\n\n### We Are In The Grips Of A Global Pandemic. What Should Business Leaders Be\nDoing Next?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hankprybylski/2020/04/07/we-are-in-the-grips-\nof-a-global-pandemic-what-should-business-leaders-be-doing-next/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Markets End Their Panic But Remain Highly Tentative\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2020/04/07/markets-end-their-\npanic-but-remain-highly-tentative/)\n\nOne company that has delivered on this is DBS Bank. The DBS Talent Acquisition\nteam created JIM (Jobs Intelligence Maestro), a virtual recruitment bot\npowered by artificial intelligence used to conduct candidate screening for\nthose applying to be wealth planning managers, a high volume job in the\nconsumer bank.\n\nFollowing the introduction of JIM in May 2018, DBS talent acquisition was able\nto: 1) shorten the screening time from 32 minutes per candidate to 8 minutes\nper candidate, 2) improve completion rate of job application from 85% to 97%\nand 3) respond to 96% of all candidate queries through JIM, allowing\nrecruiters to spend more time sharing the culture and values of DBS with\ncandidates. While these metrics are impressive, says James Loo, Head of Talent\nAcquisition Group, DBS Bank, the key learning is that the use of artificial\nintelligence provides benefits for the recruiters as well.  Recruiters no\nlonger need to spend hours to screen thousands of applicants, freeing them up\nto perform higher-value work such as sourcing, recruitment marketing, engaging\nwith candidates, and hiring managers. In fact, DBS recruiters built a new\nskill: training the Chatbot to assess candidates and answer candidates\u2019\nqueries. The future job of a recruiter may add that of  a Chatbot Coach!\n\n** **\n\n**2\\. Uniquely Human Skills Will Grow In Importance**\n\nThe demand for uniquely human skills will grow, according to the [Future of\nJobs Report from the World Economic\nForum](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf).  The World\nEconomic Forum projects that 75 million current jobs will be displaced as\nartificial intelligence takes over more routine aspects of work.\n\nHowever, 133 million new jobs will be created, and skills in both emotional\nintelligence and  technical intelligence, like technology design and\nprogramming, will be important.\n\n**Figure 1** shows the Skills Demand in 2018 and Projected for 2022.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFuture of Jobs Survey\n\nSome companies, like [Bank of America, are building a national training\nprogram to teach empathy to the banks' front line client facing roles.\n](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wanted-experts-at-soft-skills-1544360400)\n\nJohn Jordan who leads The Academy and Advisor Development at Bank of America\ncalls this a \"life stage navigation curriculum,\" assisting Bank of America\nfinancial advisors in better understanding the priorities of their customers\nin various life stages from young parent, to widower, to retiree. Jordan says,\n\"To date, almost 40,000 people have been through Academy programs, which all\ninclude some form of empathy training.\"\n\nAccording to Jordan, the need to develop empathy is growing as front line bank\nprofessionals must understand the concerns of clients at their life stage.\nThere is also a business reason to develop empathy. Research from Center for\nCreative Leadership shows developing  [emotional intelligence and\nempathy](https://www.kornferry.com/institute/empathy-emotional-intelligence-\nbusiness-skill) predicts better job performance for both front line employees\nas well as leaders.\n\n**3\\. Artificial Intelligence Won't Take Away Jobs But Help Workers Do Jobs\nBetter**\n\n[Gartner estimates that artificial intelligence will create more jobs than it\neliminates](https://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3837763).  The focus for 2019\nwill be on deciding how to use AI to help workers do their jobs better. [PwC\nforecasts 20% of executives at U.S. companies with artificial intelligence\ninitiatives report](http://explore.pwc.com/aipredictions2019/hbr-\nai-2019?eq=CT13-PL1300-DM2-CN_ai2019-ai19-fco-\nfoot&utm_campaign=ai2019&utm_medium=org&utm_source=pwc_ai2019) that they will\nroll out AI across their business this year and expect AI investment to both\nre-imagine jobs and work processes as well as grow profits and revenue.\n\nFor HR leaders, we see this already happening. Oracle and Future Workplace\nconducted research with 600 HR leaders entitled AI At Work, to learn where AI\nwas being used in the workplace to re-imagine candidate and employee\nexperience.\n\n**Figure 2** shows how this sample of 600 HR leaders answered the question:\nWhere is AI Being Used in HR?\n\nFigure 2\n\nAI at Work Survey\n\nHilton is one company already on the journey useing AI for HR. Sarah Smart,\nVice President of Global Recruiting says,\"By using artificial intelligence to\nsource, screen and interview candidates, we have increased our speed to hire\nby 85%.  We have also experienced other business benefits; such as increasing\nthe diversity of our talent pool and enabling our recruiters to identify a\nhigh performing candidate faster. Having started our journey using AI in 2014,\nwe see future use cases for AI include improving new hire onboarding and\nproviding internal talent mobility for Hilton employees.\"  To date, Hilton has\ninvested in upskilling the recruiter rather than making the role redundant.\nThink of artificial intelligence as a tool in the recruiter\u2019s tool belt to\nhelp them streamline the hiring process, while never making the final decision\nabout hiring.\n\n**4\\. New Jobs Will Be Created Using Artificial Intelligence**\n\nCreating new jobs as artificial intelligence becomes more widespread inside\ncompanies will be a huge priority for C-suite leaders in 2019.\n\nThe Center for the Future of Work at Cognizant Technology Solutions tackled\nthis issue with  two reports, [21 Jobs for the\nFuture](https://www.cognizant.com/perspectives/21-jobs-of-the-future) and [21\nMore Jobs For the Future of\nWork](https://www.cognizant.com/perspectives/there-will-be-jobs-in-the-future-\nof-work).  These jobs have been organized from low tech to high tech over the\n10-year horizon from 2019 to 2029.\n\nSince the first report was released, many of the anticipated new jobs have\ncome to life, such as Financial Wellness Managers, (which I profiled in [Three\nNew HR Roles in Age of\nAI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2018/09/24/the-future-of-work-\nthree-new-hr-roles-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/#a36d04a4cd98)\nfeaturing Financial Wellness Managers at Suntrust), to [Memory Curator and\nAugmented Reality Journey Builder jobs currently at Facebook.\n](https://www.fastcompany.com/40566448/facebook-will-let-you-build-\nimmersive-3d-memories-from-old-photos)\n\nRob Brown, Associate Vice President at Center for the Future of Work at\nCognizant Technology Solutions, shares the drivers behind the 21 More Jobs For\nthe Future of Work: \"The vision behind our newest report is to profile\nfuturistic jobs which leverage the power of artificial intelligence to blend\ntechnology with the \"human touch\" for jobs in the future workplace.\"\n\n**Figure 3** presents the latest 21 More Jobs Of the Future.\n\nFigure 3\n\n21 More Jobs\n\nTwo of my favorites include:\n\n**Voice UX Designer:** This role will leverage voice as a platform to deliver\nan \u201coptimal\u201d dialect and sound that is pleasing to each of the seven billion\nhumans on the planet. The Voice UX Designer will do this by creating a set of\nAI tools and algorithms to help individuals find their \u201cperfect voice\u201d\nassistant.\n\n**Head of Business Behavior:** The head of business behavior will analyze\nemployee behavioral data such as performance data along with data gathered\nthrough personal, environmental and spatial sensors to create strategies to\nimprove employee experience, cross company collaboration, productivity and\nemployee well-being.\n\nThe question for HR leaders is: What are new job roles in HR that are on the\nhorizon as A.I. becomes integrated into the workplace?\n\n**Chief Ethical and Humane Use Officer:** This job role is already being\nfilled by [Salesforce](http://www.salesforce.com) announcing its first Chief\nEthical and Humane Officer this month. This new role will focus on developing\nstrategies to use technology in an ethical and humane way. As practical uses\nof AI have exploded in recent years, we look for more companies to establish\nnew jobs focusing on ethical uses of AI to ensure AI's trustworthiness, while\nalso helping to diffuse fears about it.\n\n**A.I. Trainer:** This role allows the existing knowledge you have about a job\nto be ready for A.I. to use.  Creating knowledge for an A.I. supported\nworkplace requires individuals to tag or \"annotate\" discrete knowledge nuggets\nso the correct data is served up in a conversational interface. This role is\nincreasingly important as the role of a recruiter is augmented by AI.\n\n**5\\. An Artificial Intelligence Ready Workforce Will Be Critical To An\nOrganization's Future**\n\nAs as we head into 2019 \u2014 with AI moving from consumers' lives into the\nworkplace \u2013 upskilling non-AI workers to learn how to work with AI is becoming\nincreasingly important. Developing an AI ready workforce involves five key\ninitiatives:\n\n  * Identify the business problem to solve using artificial intelligence and start collecting data on the current state of the problem and the key KPI you want to impact with AI.\n  * Build a cross functional team of key stakeholders to educate them on the business benefits of using AI to solve key business problems.\n  * Implement learning opportunities for key job roles impacted in HR by AI (such as those in Recruiting, New Hire On-Boarding and Corporate Learning).\n  * Identify new jobs and skills needed as AI is leveraged in the workplace.\n  * Change performance management and development skills needed in HR roles to include a fundamental understanding of how to use artificial intelligence across the employee life cycle.\n\nWhen AI is leveraged in the organization, employees will need training  on how\nto work with their AI team members. This will grow in importance, as [Gartner\npredicts that by 2022 (just three years from now!) one in five workers engaged\nin non-routine tasks will rely on AI to do their jobs.\n](https://blogs.gartner.com/craig-roth/2017/12/05/489/)\n\n[As employees depend on the insights of AI to do their jobs, developing an AI\nready workforce will be a competitive\nadvantage.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fjeannemeister%2F2019%2F01%2F08%2Ften-\nhr-trends-in-the-age-of-artificial-\nintelligence%2F&text=As%20employees%20depend%20on%20insights%20of%20AI%20to%20do%20their%20jobs%2C%20an%20AI%20ready%20workforce%20will%20be%20a%20competitive%20advantage.)\n\n**6\\. Skills-Based Hiring Gains Traction**\n\nIn 2018, Future Workplace hosted a skills based hiring Hackathon where we\nasked, why weren\u2019t more companies adopting skills-based hiring to widen the\ntalent pool? Skills-based hiring is defined as _the practice of setting\nspecific skills and competency requirements for a job rather than rely solely\non candidates' credentials._ Today, more FORTUNE 1000 firms are going on\nrecord hiring candidates without a college degree as a requirement.\n\n**Figure 4** lists fifteen of these companies below:\n\nFigure 4\n\nGlassdoor\n\nSkills-based hiring may start by changing a job description and removing a\ndegree requirement, but it requires shifting mindsets on where and how a\ncompany sources talent. What\u2019s needed is to change the mindsets of hiring\nmanagers and business leaders to source in new ways.  These new ways to source\nnon-traditional candidates range from Boot Camps, Coding schools, MOOC's,\nTechnical high schools like [P-TECH](https://www.ibm.com/thought-\nleadership/ptech/index.html) (a joint high school diploma and associate degree\nin STEM), Job training conducted at community centers, high schools, or even\nsponsor a company wide Hackathon. Regardless of your industry, adopting a\nskills-based hiring approach requires educating business stakeholders,\nidentifying benefits & barriers of widening the talent pool, and developing a\nstrategy for both skills-based hiring as well as educational and learning\npathways to upskill a more diverse employee population.\n\n**7\\. Workers Will Trade Money For Meaning at Work**\n\nThe experience of meaningful work is a personal one, as [Gallup reports we are\nworking on average 47 hours per week with one in five working more than 60\nhours each week](https://news.gallup.com/poll/175286/hour-workweek-actually-\nlonger-seven-hours.aspx). Increasingly workers are searching for meaningful\nwork, a workplace that aligns to their values and a supportive and healthy\nwork culture.\n\nA recent report entitled  entitled [Meaning and Purpose at\nWork](https://www.betterup.co/en-us/why-betterup/our-science/#map) surveyed\n2,285 American professionals, across 26 industries to find out how important\nhaving meaning was at work.\n\nIn fact, workers said they\u2019d be willing to forego 23% of their entire future\nlifetime earnings in order to have a job that was always meaningful to them.\nThis means that building greater meaning at work is no longer a \"nice to\nhave,\" but a business imperative. Employees who find meaning at work are\nhappier, more productive and hard working, and are absent less.\n\nOn average, American workers who place a higher value on meaningful work are\nin a more senior position, and if they are working in a company that offers\nmeaningful work they stay longer. [Employees who find work highly meaningful\nare 69% less likely to plan on quitting their jobs within the next six months,\nand have job tenures that are 7.4 months longer on average than employees who\nfind work lacking in meaning](https://hbr.org/2018/11/9-out-of-10-people-are-\nwilling-to-earn-less-money-to-do-more-meaningful-\nwork?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=hbr).\n\nAs the quest for meaning in the workplace grows, more HR leaders are putting a\ngreater emphasis on communicating their company's culture and sharing their\npurpose and meaning across the employee population. This involves creating\nopportunities from training to mentoring and coaching to promote a shared\nvision and a healthy and supportive work culture.\n\n**8\\. Two Powerful Employee Perks Emerge: Access To Natural Light And Career\nDevelopment**\n\nThe news headlines about which perks create a compelling employee experience\nseem to be dominated by fads \u2014 think treadmill desks, nap pods, and \u201cbring\nyour dog to work day. \u201d However, a new survey by my firm, [Future\nWorkplace](http://futureworkplace.com/) called [\u201cThe Employee\nExperience\u201d](https://hbr.org/2018/09/the-1-office-perk-natural-light) reveals\nemployees crave something far more fundamental and essential to human needs.\nIn a [research poll of 1,614 North American employees, we found that access to\nnatural light and views of the outdoors are the number one attribute of the\nworkplace environment](https://view.com/), outranking traditional benefits\nlike onsite cafeterias, fitness centers, and premium perks including on-site\nchildcare ([only 4-8% of FORTUNE 100 companies offer on-site child\ncare](https://theoutline.com/post/1610/the-fortune-100-companies-that-offer-\non-site-day-care-to-employees?zd=1&zi=ekcr2ymz)).  A great example of this is\n[The Spheres](https://www.seattlespheres.com/), an Amazon workspace in\ndowntown Seattle that\u2019s a curated jungle with over 40,000 plants. Amazon\u2019s\nSpheres relies on the premise that natural light, plant life, and healthy\nactivities reduce employee stress and improve job satisfaction more so than a\nstandard office building. (Note that in contrast to many of its peers, Amazon\nhas chosen to invest in Spheres rather than other office perks such as free\nlunches and snacks).\n\nIn addition to designing the physical environment to promote employee well-\nbeing, companies are also creating more opportunities for internal career\nmobility. With more than 7 million jobs unfilled, companies are recognizing\nthe importance of creating internal mobility and job rotation programs to keep\nemployees motivated and engaged. Both MasterCard and Intuit stress career\nplanning and invest in internal career mobility and navigation. The [Wall\nStreet Journal reports each company is a leader in their industry in terms of\nprofitability. ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-perks-no-longer-cut-it-for-\nworkers-1543846157)\n\n** **\n\n**9\\. Virtual Reality Is Transforming Corporate Training**\n\nA growing number of heads of global learning & development are piloting\nVirtual Reality (VR) to train employees. And the most interesting use cases\nrevolve around using virtual reality for compliance training. Verizon is using\nvirtual reality to train store managers on protocol in case there is a store\nrobbery. Lou Tedrick, VP-Global Learning & Development, Verizon, says, \"We've\nfound that virtual reality is the best way to effectively replicate learning\nexperiences that were previously challenging or impossible, such as our Retail\nStore Robbery. The feedback we've received from our participants in these\ndifficult learning scenario trainings justifies the additional investment\ninvolved in VR over a more traditional instructional method.\"\n\nIn addition to Verizon, MasterCard is using virtual reality to help employees\nimprove their soft skills as well as train them on what to do in a crisis\nsituation, such as an active shooter in the workplace or a building fire.\nWalmart is also using virtual reality to train 1 million associates across\n4,700 stores in the U.S. on various aspects of store operations from taking\ncare of produce to handling crowds on Black Friday.\n\nVirtual reality training has clearly expanded from early use by the Arizona\nCardinals who started using virtual reality headsets to prepare for games, to\nthe design of virtual reality learning experiences. Derek Belch, founder of\n[STRIVR](https://strivr.com/), and Scott Schneider, CEO of\n[HTXLabs](https://www.htxlabs.com/), both see companies no longer asking \"What\ncan I use AI for?\" but rather \"How can I widely deploy AI across the\norganization?\"\n\n**10\\. HR Call To Action: Preparing For The Future of Work Is a Team Sport**\n\n_[Deloitte Capital\nTrends](https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-\ntrends.html)_   reports  a key challenge for business leaders is the need to\nwork more closely together: acting as a symphony of experts playing in\nharmony.\n\nBut, three-quarters of those surveyed said C-level executives do not agree on\ncommon priorities or in concert. Often, the CHRO focuses on HR, CIO on IT\nissues, CFO on numbers, CMO on marketing  \u2014 and now new C-level players are\nappearing \u2013 Chief Digital Officer, and Chief Ethical Officer. As the pace of\nchange accelerates, it is more important than ever for C-level executives to\nagree  on a shared vision in the age of AI.\n\n[Preparing for the future of work is a team\nsport.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fjeannemeister%2F2019%2F01%2F08%2Ften-\nhr-trends-in-the-age-of-artificial-\nintelligence%2F&text=Preparing%20for%20the%20future%20of%20work%20is%20a%20team%20sport.)\n\nSahil Sahni, Co-Founder of [AllyO](https://www.allyo.com/) sees the importance\nof this in working with clients. Clients need to build cross-functional\nalignment between CHRO, CIO, CDO and CMO in order to agree on the business\nproblem that needs to be solved and this is especially important in the age of\nartificial intelligence.\n\nWhat HR trends are you preparing for in the age of artificial intelligence?\n\nJeanne Meister is Founding Partner, [Future\nWorkplace](https://futureworkplace.com/) and a faculty member of [Using AI 4\nHR to Enhance The Employee Experience.](https://usingai4hr.com/) Jeanne is\npassionate about the impact of using artificial intelligence to re-imagine the\nemployee life cycle.\n\n\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@jcmeister).

More and more companies are beginning to use AI-\nsolutions to help speed up the process and make it less hit or miss.\n\nHere we highlight 7 areas of recruitment where AI might be used to lighten the\nload for recruiters and find better candidates for their organization and\npositions.\n\n[**RELATED:  RUSSIAN ROBOT USES AI TO RECRUIT AND HIRE HUMANS FOR MAJOR\nCOMPANIES**](https://interestingengineering.com/russian-robot-uses-ai-to-\nrecruit-and-hire-humans-for-major-companies)\n\n## What is artificial intelligence in recruitment?\n\n[Artificial intelligence](https://interestingengineering.com/training-ai-is-\nshockingly-costly-to-the-environment) is finding many [applications in various\nindustries](https://interestingengineering.com/ai-proves-to-be-10-faster-and-\nmore-accurate-than-top-human-lawyers), and recruitment is no different. AI can\nbe employed to help the recruitment process for companies by employing\nmachine-learning and problem-solving to help find the best candidate(s) for a\nposition.\n\n\"This new technology is designed to streamline or automate some part of the\nrecruiting workflow, especially repetitive, high-volume tasks.\n\nFor example, software that applies machine learning to resumes to auto-screen\ncandidates or software that conducts sentiment analysis on job descriptions to\nidentify [any] potentially-biased language.\" -\n_[ideal.com](https://ideal.com/ai-recruiting/)._\n\n## Will AI replace human recruiters?\n\nWith the rapid pace of development and deployment in many industries,\nespecially recruitment, you might wonder if it will [ever replace human\nrecruiters](https://www.ere.net/when-ai-will-replace-recruiters/)?\n\nWhile AI can be a lot more efficient at \"cold\" sorting candidates based on\ncriteria set by the potential employer and available data, it is probably\nunlikely that AI will completely replace all human recruiters.\n\nThe human touch will likely always be a necessary component of the recruitment\nprocess in the future. It can be thought of as more of an advanced labor-\nsaving aid rather than something that will completely replace all human\nrecruiters in the future.\n\n\"How do you replace empathy or contextual understanding with AI? Seems like a\nstretch to me. AI can do the mundane and boring work most people don't like so\nthey can focus on more interesting tasks, like building relationships with\nhiring managers over good coffee and helping them solve big problems.\"\nexplained [Ben Martinez](https://twitter.com/fistfuloftalent) at [Fistful of\nTalent](http://fistfuloftalent.com/2018/06/recruiters-must-using-ai-make-\nwildest-dreams-come-true.html) to _[yello.co.](https://yello.co/blog/what-to-\nexpect-and-not-expect-from-ai-in-recruitment/)_  \n\n## What is Paradox's Olivia?\n\n\"[Paradox](http://www.paradox.ai/)\" is an AI development company based in\nScottsdale Arizona. Their flagship product is an AI recruitment tool called\nOlivia.\n\n\"Olivia helps companies capture and screen candidates, improve conversions,\nand answer all candidate questions. She delivers one-to-one candidate\nexperience at scale and even handles interview scheduling.\n\nAt Paradox, we see a future where humans do the things they're best at, and AI\ntechnology handles the mundane and simple tasks for us. Technology is a tool\nfor us and should be used as such.\n\nWe never want to remove humans from the recruiting process. We just want to\nmake it better.\n\nOur dream is a better candidate and recruiter experience for everyone.\" -\n[Paradox.](https://www.linkedin.com/company/olivia-by-paradox.ai/about/)\n\n## What are some examples of AI being used in recruitment?\n\nHere are 7 examples of how AI is being employed to [help revolutionize the\nrecruitment process](https://harver.com/blog/ai-in-recruitment-2019/) for many\ncompanies around the world.\n\n### 1\\. AI is helping improve online applications\n\nOne of the ways that AI is helping companies with recruitment is through\nonline application management. [Applicant\ntracking](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-\nai-is-revolutionizing-applicant-tracking-and-the-recruitment-process/) from\nrecruiter databases tends to use a lot of keywords, word flows, and other data\npoints that AI can sort, search and analyze with ease.\n\nAI is helping recruiters prioritize [thousands of\nresumes](https://www.insidercareerstrategies.com/) to help speed up candidate\nselection. They, in effect, are acting like digital recruitment consultants.\n\nIn the future, it is not inconceivable that companies will use them to\nactively help job hunters to make job application more effective using\npredictive analytics.\n\n### 2\\. They are being used to find the best-fit candidates\n\nAI can be used by companies to help find the [best-fit\ncandidates](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2018/08/30/see-how-\nthis-ai-assistant-helps-recruiters-find-the-best-candidates/) for the position\nand their organization. It can be employed to fill in the gaps that employers\nmight not be able to glean from a resume.\n\nFor example, it can analyze a candidate's online presence and discover that\nthey are very active in social causes. Alternatively, a candidate would also\nbe able to use AI to find the best fit for them by creating a profile for\ntheir values, goals and career aspirations.\n\n### 3\\. AI is helping speed up shortlisting of applicants\n\nAI can be used to[ save recruiters a ton of time](http://www.innersurf.com/)\nby preselecting the best candidates for a given position. Instead of humans\nhaving to skim through hundreds or thousands of resumes, an AI could be\nunleashed to sort the wheat from the chaff.\n\n\"AI can search to find matching candidates, make contact, conduct preliminary\ninterviews, assess resumes, and present the best for an interview. \" -\n_[Forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/08/10/10-ways-\nartificial-intelligence-will-change-recruitment-practices/#71f1c6433a2c). _\n\n### 4\\. It is being used to provide a level playing field\n\nAI can also be used to help [level the playing field for\ncandidates](https://www.leadershiprefinery.com/). No longer will the chances\nof getting an interview be underpinned by their ability to be 'liberal with\nthe truth' on their resumes.\n\n![ai recruitment is the future](https://inteng-\nstorage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/3oOpXB1MOW/sizes/ai-recruitment-the-\nfuture_resize_md.jpg) Source:\n_[Massimiliano/Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/myreflex/111856820/in/photolist-\naTi8S-9ELjRw-AxNt9n-6XMXC2-aMVUvK-aMVTFn-nYRgnn-pwvoDS-\naMVU8K-3dNaug-24MeiDB-8eoHLC-\nAWH6P6-5i6bmu-5i1SsR-5i1RKM-5i6eHS-5i6fAd-5i1T2k-6MqhU5-AWH6et-6MqhWN-7GsA48-6Mm64g-77XvRo-7GsA7K-77TBhr-7GsAh6-6Mm6er-7GsAcT-7GwwpG-6MqhYd-\novPJP-7GsA9k-BLF8ij-7GsAei-6Mm5ZV-6MqhPj-S12Hkt-eacBFS-\nRqoH2u-8zA8Fz-24fxhpw-284JoNU-8XZadK-9oaaqf-anM51w-9o5oNH-6Mm5yD-BLF7UJ)_\n\nThis will probably require candidates to network a lot more than was necessary\nbefore.\n\n\"Building and maintaining authentic, professional relationships will help\npeople stand out and land the interview.\" -\n_[Forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/08/10/10-ways-\nartificial-intelligence-will-change-recruitment-practices/#71f1c6433a2c)_.  \n\n### 5\\. AI is being used to vet characters\n\nAs [remote working](https://qz.com/1161017/remote-work-is-reaching-\nunprecedented-levels-of-popularity-and-thats-a-good-thing/) is becoming ever\nmore popular, [AI can be used to help vet\ncandidates](https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18202335/ai-artificial-\nintelligence-recruiting-hiring-hr-bias-prejudice) to ensure they are\ntrustable. There are already some AI tools being employed for this purpose to\nhelp identify potential threats when hiring someone to work remotely.\n\nSuch tools can help assess potential employees' honesty and ethics and help\ndetermine whether they would be a good representative for the organization.\nThis will not only help vet good candidates but will enable the organization\nto distribute its workforce more widely.\n\nThis will probably prove invaluable for service companies like Lyft, Airbnb\nand Uber.\n\n### 6\\. Artificial intelligence is also being used during interviews\n\nArtificial intelligence, like Paradox's Olivia, is being used to [help with\nthe interview process](https://www.analyticsindiamag.com/top-5-ai-powered-job-\ninterview-tools-used-by-recruiters/). It can help deal with some of the basic\nquestions saving the real guts of the interview process human recruiters.\n\n\"AI is already replacing portions of the interviewing process. I've had\nclients who were surprised to show up for a Skype interview and were asked\nquestions via AI.\n\nThis interview format results in a new set of challenges because applicants no\nlonger benefit from social and visual cues. It becomes more critical to have a\nrobust preparation to convey essential information and set themselves apart.\"\n- Jean Ali Muhlbauer told\n_[Forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/08/10/10-ways-\nartificial-intelligence-will-change-recruitment-practices/#71f1c6433a2c)_.\n\n### 7\\. AI is helping to provide recruitment automation and advanced data\nanalytics\n\nMore traditional recruitment tended to rely on luck and intuition rather than\ntaking a more scientific approach. This older model is very time consuming and\ncan be a little scattershot in its results.\n\nBut with the wealth of data we have today a more [data-driven recruitment\nprocess](https://readwrite.com/2019/03/18/5-ways-artificial-intelligence-is-\ntransforming-recruitment-in-2019/) is being opened up, especially when AI is\nemployed. Data-driven recruiting not only helps in improving the quality of\nhire but also in several different areas.\n\nThese include better allocation of funds for recruitment. For example,\ntargeting candidates using social media, etc.\n\nIt can also be used to help build \"[hiring\nfunnels](https://recruiterbox.com/blog/recruiting-hiring-funnel-get-step-\nright)\". AI can, for example, be used to analyze why certain conversion rates\nfrom applications are less, or more, effective than others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## Sponsored Stories\n\n## Stay on top of the latest engineering news\n\nJust enter your email and we\u2019ll take care of the rest:\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\nBy subscribing, you agree to our [Terms of\nUse](https://interestingengineering.com/terms-of-service) and [Privacy\nPolicy](https://interestingengineering.com/privacy-policy).

success depends on a variety of factors, and the recruiting trend\nlandscape is no exception.\n\nAn analysis of today\u2019s market suggests an economy shaped by several factors,\nincluding a gig economy that continues to expand, and a skills gap bemoaned by\nmany HR professionals.\n\n## What's shaping recruiting trends?\n\nThe unemployment rate hovers at a record low of 3.5%, a number that has\nsteadily decreased every year since the height of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nBy many estimates, the U.S. economy is considered at full employment. For\nemployers, that means it\u2019s a slow time to hire, as many positions remain\nunfilled because the number of jobs available exceeds the number of candidates\nlooking for employment.\n\nA low employment rate brings its own set of unique challenges for recruiting,\nand with global issues like a trade war with China and the U.K.\u2019s expected\ndeparture from the European Union, the global economy might be in for\nuncertain times.\n\nA slow time to hire means recruiters will need to [compete for top\ntalent](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/hiring-grads-with-soft-skills/) and\nrecruiting tactics will need to be increasingly innovative.\n\nHere are six things we see coming in 2020:\n\n## 1\\. Recruiting with flexibility\n\nA competitive hiring market means offering perks to employees, including one\nthat\u2019s increasingly prioritized by job seekers: flexibility. According to a\n[2019 survey conducted by the International Workplace\nGroup](http://www.iwgplc.com/global-workspace-survey-2019), 80% of respondents\nsaid they\u2019d choose the job offer that came with flexibility over the one that\ndid not. Furthermore, 85% of businesses responded that productivity actually\nincreased in their workplace due to more flexibility.\n\nOffering flexibility as a job perk, i.e., allowing employees to work some time\nfrom home and other hours at the office, can help you gain an advantage versus\nbusinesses offering positions that do not include flexibility. Flexibility, of\ncourse, can depend on the type of job and technology involved and is most\nsuitable for employees who can work remotely via their laptops.\n\n## 2\\. Hiring outside your target market\n\nThe shortage of workers who are traditionally qualified for specific jobs\nmeans employers will continue to look outside their traditional target\nmarkets. This means hiring will not necessarily be based on prior job\nexperience, but based on the candidate\u2019s potential for growth and the ability\nto be trained on the spot.\n\nEmployers will also need to look for skills they think will help prospective\nemployees easily adapt to the responsibilities of the job \u2014 otherwise known as\ntransferable skills. Transferable skills can include things like\ndependability, strong communication skills, organization, adaptability and\nleadership.\n\n## 3\\. Video recruiting\n\nVideo has been increasingly used by organizations in their recruiting\nprocesses to convey what tasks the job entails and to showcase the\norganization\u2019s culture, mission and values. [Use of\nvideo](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/video-interviewing/) can help\norganizations speak to prospects remotely, record interviews for feedback from\nother team members and assess personality traits.\n\n## 4\\. Collaborative recruiting\n\nBuilding your business through networking and current co-worker connections is\na great tactic that can bring quality team members to your organization. An\nemployee referral program that provides incentives to employees who recruit\npeople they know can be highly beneficial to both employer and employee.\n\nAccording to a CareerBuilder study from the early 2010s, 88% of employers\nsurveyed rated employee referrals higher than all other sources as the best\nmeans of generating return-on-investment. When competition for employees is so\nhigh, finding new hires through connections rather than job boards is a viable\nand compelling alternative.\n\n## 5\\. Automation\n\nTechnology is becoming increasingly more capable, and digging through each\nresume manually is becoming a thing of the past for large organizations.\nAutomation can help facilitate candidate screening, interview scheduling and\nskills analysis.\n\n## 6\\. Diversity hiring\n\nIn 2015, a [study performed by the consulting firm McKinsey &\nCompany](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-\ninsights/why-diversity-matters) found that companies with greater racial and\ngender diversity were 35% more likely to have financial returns higher than\ntheir respective industry medians on a national basis.\n\n## The take home\n\nWhatever recruitment tactics organizations choose to integrate in 2020,\nmethods will ultimately be at the mercy of the job market and the global\neconomy.\n\nWhile we can\u2019t predict the future of the economy, we can guarantee this:\nRecruitment will be defined by innovation and technology \u2014 and the\norganizations that embrace both will have greater success at recruiting the\nright employees for the long haul.\n\n![Angela Harder, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Angela\nHarder, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Angela\nHarder, HR Expert Contributor](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/angelaharder-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Angela Harder, HR Expert\nContributor](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/aharderhrmorning-com/)\n\nAngela is the Director of Consulting at [CorTalent](https://cor3talent.com/)\nand has a background in traditional HR and start-up operations.

digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\nIt's been an incredible year for HR professionals all across Asia - from\ntackling work-life integration by [finding ways to reduce\nstress](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-taiyo-nippon-\nsanso-holdings-singapore-reduces-work-related-stress/) to using a [compressed\nworkweek arrangement](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-axa-\naffin-gis-compressed-workweek-drives-high-employee-engagement/) to boost\nemployee engagement, to using technology to [achieve a paperless and\ndigitalised talent acquisition\nprocess](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-experian-\nmalaysia-achieved-a-paperless-and-digitalised-talent-acquisition-process/).\n\nIn the backdrop of these accomplishments, we're featuring a list of HR\nsuperpowers going in to 2020, and we're confident that you'll love to continue\nworking on these (and many more!) to bring HR to the next level, onwards and\nupwards.\n\n**The guidelines below are compiled from Hibob 's new whitepaper, _[A Great HR\nLeader](https://www.hibob.com/resource-center/a-great-hr-leader/)_ as well as\nthrough _Human Resources Online 's_ editorial team.**\n\n### 1\\. Know the basics\n\nAccording to Folkman Zenger\u2019s [5-year global study of 360\u00ba feedback on HR\nleaders](https://hbr.org/2015/08/what-separates-great-hr-leaders-from-the-\nrest), one of the attributes other members of the organisation highly value in\nHR leaders is their knowledge of labour laws, hiring practices, C&B, anti-\ndiscrimination policy, medical and family leave, occupational health and\nsafety.\n\n**Three ways to improve your knowledge of HR fundamentals:**\n\n1\\. Subscribe to trade publications and websites: Global publications and\nwebsites like _Harvard Business Review_ and Bersin by Deloitte are a great way\nto stay connected to studies and academic theory as it applies to the modern\nworkplace. Closer home (here comes a self plug), _Human Resources Online_ is\ndevoted completely towards bolstering your approach towards HR strategy across\nAsia, and here's how you can [stay posted on our\ne-bulletin](https://www.lighthouse-media.com/subhumanresources/).\n\n2\\. Attend events: You\u2019re probably already promoting peer-to-peer learning\nopportunities within your organisation, so doing the same with your\ncounterparts in other organisations can be a key way to hear of tactics and\nstrategies, get help solving knotty problems, receive recommendations for\nvendors and products, and focus on new and emerging areas of thought. [Check\nout these [15 networking tips at\nevents](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/15-networking-tips-for-the-busy-\nhr-professional/) and our [upcoming 2020\nevents](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/events/)]\n\n3\\. Upskill via courses and seminars: Continuous learning is a hallmark of\ngreat HR careers, so look out for degrees, short courses, diplomas, lectures,\nand online learning opportunities to help fill in any gaps in your (and your\nteam\u2019s) knowledge. Do check out our range of [HR\nMasterclasses](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/).\n\n* * *\n\n### 2\\. Embrace data\n\nWith a strong foundation in digital tools and capture mechanisms, here are\njust some of the ways data can be used:\n\n  1. Automate and improve hiring and onboarding [[How digital HR transformed onboarding at Novant Health](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-digital-hr-transformed-onboarding-at-novant-health/)]\n  2. Measure productivity at individual, team, and enterprise levels [[Potential productivity boost from working at home and telecommuting](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/potential-productivity-boost-from-working-at-home-and-telecommuting/)]\n  3. Setting up clear project goals and targets, as well as measuring them [[How Jewel Paymentech helped employees prioritise what\u2019s urgent and outcomes that matter](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-jewel-paymentech-helped-employees-prioritise-whats-urgent-and-outcomes-that-matter/)]\n  4. Predict and prevent employee churn at an individual level [[Managing HR tech transformation in a rapidly-growing business](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-managing-hr-tech-transformation-in-a-rapidly-growing-business/)]\n\n**Three ways to get data literate:**\n\n1\\. Understand the benefits of data: It\u2019s worth spending some time reading\n[case studies](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/?s=case+study) and reports\non just how powerful big data can be to areas like engagement and retention,\nproductivity, and performance. This may also mean learning from others. For\nexample, accessing the expertise of a consultant or a data scientist to\nconnect the theory to the practicalities of your organisation.\n\n2\\. Use the right tools: The price of getting the wrong tool can be great \u2013 in\ncost, productivity, and engagement, so it\u2019s essential that you undertake\nsignificant research in the selection of these tools by requesting demos,\nseeking a range of tenders, asking the sales associates as many questions\npossible, and trialing the product before buying.\n\n3\\. Upskill your people: You\u2019ll have to be the biggest advocate for data in\norder to gain buy-in and traction in your organisation. You\u2019ll also need to\ncreate opportunities for your people to learn how to use any tools you\nintroduce, designing training, or bringing in experts.\n\n* * *\n\n### 3\\. Be innovative and strategic\n\nThere are three main pillars of design thinking:\n\n  * Empathy: Understanding the needs and problems of those you\u2019re designing for.\n  * Ideation: Generating a lot of ideas to solve the problems you\u2019ve identified.\n  * Experimentation: Testing those ideas with prototyping.\n\n**Three ways to innovate:**\n\n1\\. Learn from best practice: If your \u201ccustomers\u201d are employees, learn what it\nis that they want through surveys and conversations, which will assist with\nthe empathy aspect of design thinking.\n\n2\\. Collaborate with other departments: To brainstorm ways to solve the people\nissues faced by your organisation in the ideation phase, gather people from\nall areas and levels of the company.\n\n3\\. Think culture: Culture is created and demonstrated by leaders, and as the\npeople leader, the burden lies with you to define and bring to life a culture\nthat keeps employees engaged and healthy.\n\n* * *\n\n### 4\\. Know the business\n\nOne of the ways HR professionals can thrive in the new work paradigm is to\nstep away from the old model of HR-as-administrator. To earn a seat at the\nstrategy table, HR leaders must understand how people resources affect the\nbusiness as a whole.\n\n**How to get to know your business:**\n\n1\\. Secondment and embedding: As an HR leader, make it your business to get to\nknow the rest of the business by spending time embedded within other teams and\nencouraging cross-functional cooperation and communication.\n\n2\\. Familiarise yourself with industry movements: Thorough knowledge of market\nmovements will help you be prepared and proactive when fluctuations inevitably\naffect your organisation.\n\n3\\. Prove your ability to be a business partner: It\u2019s not enough just to\ncollect data, but great HR leaders must also analyse and interpret it for the\nbenefit of other leaders in the business. For example, data might reveal that\na team is failing; it\u2019s the HR leader\u2019s position as a people expert that\nenables them to understand why and solve the problem.\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

a message every HR professional needs to hear\nas the transformation of work continues.  As a strategy, employee engagement\nhas always been a chief concern for human resources and leaders within any\ngiven company, but no one could have predicted when the concept was first\nintroduced nearly 30 years ago, that it would have the impact on the business'\nstrategy that it does now.\n\nHaving said that, engagement isn't just about getting better results for the\nbusiness, it's about ensuring the company's longevity.  And given recent\nstatistical data, it's become a financial imperative.\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/ee_stat_1.png)\n\nThat's an astonishing number, one that should spur every HR professional to\nplace more focus on their organization's engagement strategy.  Low engagement\nfrom employees can and will have a negative impact every part of the business\nfrom recruitment to retention.\n\nIn the guide below, the HR Exchange Network explores the topic of engagement\nin more detail.  It takes a look an in depth look at what engagement is, the\ncurrent state of affairs, effective strategies and a prediction of what is to\ncome.\n\n# **What is Employee Engagement?**\n\nIf one were to ask HR professionals from different companies to define\nengagement, there is a high likelihood different responses would be received.\nSome might take a numbers approach while others would take [a psychological\napproach](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/articles/the-\nimportance-of-the-psychological-contract) or a different approach altogether.\nAs is often the case with other HR concepts, the definition really lies in the\n\"eyes of the beholder.\"\n\nThe term was first coined by psychologist William Kahn in a 1990 study titled\n[_Psychological Conditions of Personal Engagement and Disengagement at\nWork_](https://www.talenteck.com/academic/Kahn-1990.pdf).  In the piece, Khan\nstudied two different workplaces:  a very structured and formal architecture\nfirm and a casual summer camp.  From his observations, he defined engagement\nas \"the harnessing of organization members' selves to their work roles; in\nengagement, people employ and express themselves physically, cognitively, and\nemotionally during role performances\".\n\nAdditionally, Kahn outlined three [psychological\nconditions](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/news/psychological-contracts-and-leadership) that allow engagement\nto exist:\n\n  1. **Meaningfulness** - Is the work meaningful enough to the employee that he/she engages with their full-self?\n  2. **Safety** - Is the work environment such that a person can bring their full-self without fear of criticism?\n  3. **Availability** - Is the employee mentally and physically able to express their full-self in the work environment?\n\nKahn further stated those individuals who are fully engaged with the\norganization will take ownership of their work and will be loyal to the\norganization.  Additionally, he says engagement isn't a constant.  Any number\nof experiences can cause engagement to change.\n\n#### HR and the Future of Work 2020\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/future_of_work_inlinead_image.png)\n\nA new era of HR dawns. Where once HR ruled with the \"one-size-fits-all\"\nmentality, younger employees are rebuking the idea. Ideas like development,\nflexible scheduling, gig markets and remote work are the building blocks of\ntheir mission. This FREE online event will help HR professionals once again\nfind their footing in these changing times while bringing together HR\nprofessionals who are successfully addressing the issues of diversity,\npersonalization, and adapting to the future of work.\n\n[Register Now](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/events-future-of-\nwork-2020/?mac=HRIQ_OnlineEvents_Inline_Ad_Listing\u00aeisterModal=true)\n\nOf course, Kahn's original definition has changed somewhat over the three\ndecades since it was first coined.  Instead of engagement being focused solely\non the person bringing their full-selves to work, it's more about the\nemployee's willingness to go \"[above and\nbeyond](https://theirf.org/research/irf-history-of-employee-engagement/1555/)\"\nto benefit the organization.\n\n## **Impacts of Engagement**\n\nWhat we've learned about engagement since its inception has colored the\napproach HR professionals and leaders have taken.  An [increase in engagement\nmarks a positive impact of the\nbusiness](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/articles/how-\nhr-is-driving-business-impact-at-buzzfeed) and a decrease marks a negative\nimpact.\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/ee_stat_2.png)\n\n    \n    \n    Source:  [Building a High Development Culture Through Your Employee Engagement Strategy](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/267512/development-culture-engagement-paper-2019.aspx) - Gallup  \n      \n      \n    \n\n## **What are HR Leaders Saying?**\n\nTo understand more about employee engagement, here are a few quotes from HR\nprofessionals on the topic and associated issues.\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/v2_debbie_fiorino_employee_engagement_quote.gif)\n\n\"High engagement through amazing culture and opportunities for your teammates\nis one of, if not the main drivers, in increasing teammate retention.\" Atrium\nHealth's SVP of Workforce Engagement Sebastien Girard said.  \"High retention\nand high engagement results creates less pressure on the organization and HR.\nIt also means higher expertise, higher tenure, accelerated growth, and\nstronger productivity.\"\n\n\"There is a direct correlation between the level of engagement an employee\ndemonstrates and the amount of discretionary effort they are offer,\" World\nTravel Holdings senior vice president of Human Resources Debbie Fiorino said.\n\"An engaged employee is one who is fully involved in, and enthusiastic about\ntheir work, and thus will act in a way that furthers their organization's\ninterests. This translates to a greater experience for our customers, which\ngenerates a loyal following. Loyal customers translate to revenue and\nprofits.\"\n\n\"I would say that engagement is harder to achieve today than it was 20 years\nago, or in the past, because we are less engaging places to work. We used to\nhave an ethos where employees would come to an organization; they would commit\nto an organization, build a career there and want to stay for life. The\ncompany would equally make a commitment that it would develop a career for\nlife,\" ICON plc executive vice president of strategic initiates Don Kraft\nsaid.  \"Companies would look out for people, protect them and invest in them.\nOver a period of time, we have invested less and signaled a reduced commitment\nto people. As a result there are many people, including a generation of young\npeople, in their 30s and under, who have watched their parents, and perhaps\nthemselves, impacted by these things. They are saying, \"I can't, and therefore\nI won't, count on my employer.\"\n\n## **Engagement Ideas**\n\nHR practioners globally are looking for the right engagement \"recipe\".  As is\noften the case, the \"recipe\" is different for every company in every industry.\nAs a result, it is often difficult for HR to know where to start.  There is\nsomething to be said for looking at other companies, especially those that are\nsimilar, for inspiration, but the best place to start is internally.  Here are\nfive different [strategies and theories as to how to increase employee\nengagement](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/infographics/employee-engagement-best-practices) across the\nworkforce.\n\n1\\. Flexibility\n\nOffering employees an opportunity to set and design their own schedule feels\ncounterintuitive at first glance.  Most HR leaders are conditioned to believe\ngiving an employee the ability to set their own work hours will cause a\ndecrease in productivity.  A fair amount of research suggests the opposite is\ntrue.  Employees given the freedom to set their own schedules are often more\nproductive and happier employees.  They are also more engaged in the\nworkplace.\n\n> RELATED:  [12 Work-Life Balance\n> Tips](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/news/12-work-\n> life-balance-tips)\n\n2\\. Required Tools\n\nWhen an employee starts working for a new company, he or she will expect to\nhave the needed tools to complete their job responsibilities effectively.  If\nthe employee has access to those items and can work as expected, employee\nengagement will flourish.  Deloitte calls this \"enabling infrastructure.\"\nWithout the necessary tools, employees will disengage.\n\n3\\. Employee Surveys\n\nEmployee feedback is important.  Even more important is the need for leaders\nto listen to the feedback and act on that information.  This isn't to say\nevery leader has to do or put into practice every employee suggestion, but\nthey do need to consider the feedback.  Additionally, the leader must be\ntransparent about the feedback and whether it will be put into action.\nAccording to an engagement report from Aon, this approach to feedback helps an\norganization quickly address problems, but more importantly it makes the\nemployee feel valued.  Thus, it increases engagement.\n\n4\\. Manager selection\n\nIt's been said before:  employees don't leave companies.  They leave bad\nmanagers.  Managers and leaders are critical to engagement success according\nto Gallup.  The right leader knows their success and the organization's\nsuccess is linked to the engagement of the employee.  Hiring the right\nexternal candidate or internal candidate for a manager role; one whom\npossesses the ability to manage people effectively can have a positive impact\non engagement rates.\n\n5\\. Training and Development Opportunities\n\nInvesting in employees' by offering training and development opportunities\nprovides the atmosphere for workers to become more engaged.  A lack of these\nopportunities typically translates to the employee not feeling valued by the\ncompany and will thus negatively impact the chance for engagement.  Employees\nwho are not invested will not support the company in any way other than making\nsure they can protect their job.  At least until they can secure other\nemployment.\n\n## **Measuring Engagement**\n\nWhen it comes to measuring engagement, there are several schools of thought on\nthe issue.  Some suggest an organic approach.  Gathering data through\nconversations such as one-on-one meetings or team meetings.  Others suggest a\nformal approach like engagement surveys that happen once or twice a year.\nThese surveys can provide a wealth of data that helps indicate what engagement\ninitiatives are working and how engaged employees actually are with the\norganization.\n\nEngagement surveys differ from other types of surveys.  According to [SHRM,\nengagement surveys measure](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-\nsamples/toolkits/pages/sustainingemployeeengagement.aspx) \"employees'\ncommitment, motivation, sense of purpose and passion for their work and the\norganization\" while other surveys, satisfaction surveys for instance, measure\nworkers' \"views, attitudes and perceptions of their organization.\"\n\nThe most important piece of measuring engagement isn't the measurement itself,\nhowever.  It's all about how the results are shared and how the findings are\nput into action.  If leaders have access to this information, share it and\nthen don't capitalize on it, they can expect engagement scores to suffer in\nthe future.\n\n## **The Future of Engagement**\n\nEngagement will continue to be a main focus moving forward.  As eluded to\nearlier, this is directly related to the fact the workforce is transforming.\nToday's newest workers and their successors care more about personal growth\nand purpose than just getting a paycheck from employers.  They want to make a\ndifference while growing and building relationships with the organization and\nco-workers.\n\nBut changes in the workforce aren't the only catalyst for the increased\nimportance of engagement.  It shares the spotlight with technology.\nTechnology has revolutionized the way people work and engage with that work\nand one another.  And technology, like engagement, is constantly in flux.\n\nAll of this points to the reality engagement continues to play, as it will in\nthe future, a large role.  Engaging these workers will be critical to future\nsuccess, not only of the organization, but so too for the employee.  Now more\nthan ever before, the organizations and their futures hang on the success of\ntheir respective employees.\n\n> NEXT:  [Talent Acquisition:  HR's Guide for Finding the Best\n> Talent](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\n> acquisition/articles/talent-acquisition-hrs-guide-for-finding-the-best-\n> talent)\n\n\n\n**_Want more content faster?

On the one hand,\nthey must fulfill workforce management and engagement needs, while on the\nother hand, the demand for top talent is on a steady rise. This has resulted\nin the role of a **[corporate\nrecruiter](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/corporate-recruiter-jobdescription-salary-keyskills/)** , who takes\ncharge of top-of-the-funnel or primary recruitment activities.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to hire a corporate recruiter in 2020 \u2013 or become one\nyourself \u2013 you need to know the right skill set and tools to do the job. In\nthis detailed guide, we look at how corporate recruiters can be integral to\nbusiness growth and the skills that should be on your radar should you choose\nto don this role or hire for it.\n\n## **Table of Contents**\n\n  * **What Is a Corporate Recruiter?**\n  * **What Is a Corporate Recruiter\u2019s Job Description?**\n  * **How Much Does a Corporate Recruiter Make?**\n  * **What Are the Key Skills You Need in a Corporate Recruiter for 2020?**\n  * **Innovation Is Central to the Future of Corporate Recruitment**\n\n## **What Is a Corporate Recruiter?**\n\nA corporate recruiter can be defined as an individual tasked with hiring\ntalent for the company or organization where they are employed, charged mainly\nwith the sourcing and screening of candidates.\n\nRecruitment is a complex function involving several top-of-the-funnel, mid-\nfunnel, and bottom-of-the-funnel tasks. At the very bottom, you have the final\nselection and **[onboarding\nprocess](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-\nis-new-employee-onboarding/)**. The middle of the funnel consists of engaging\nwith selected candidates, negotiating terms and conditions, and finalizing the\noffer.\n\nAt the top are the highest number of tasks, such as selecting the right\nchannels for candidate sourcing, building an outreach program to establish\nyour employer brand, interacting with different recruitment stakeholders, and\nseveral others.\n\nCorporate recruiters are responsible for these top-of-the-funnel initiatives.\nFor example, they may regularly visit colleges and universities to conduct\nrecruitment drives. Typically, they\u2019ll also be the first point of contact for\ninbound job applications. However, they may also be responsible for extending\noffers and onboarding new employees. As you can see, a corporate recruiter\u2019s\nrole is layered, comprising a mix of iterative tasks as well as strategic\nresponsibilities.\n\nCorporate recruiters work for only the company that is hiring on the permanent\npayroll. In other words, they aren\u2019t consulting headhunters or individuals at\nrecruitment agencies brought in to fill a specific number of vacancies.\n\nThat\u2019s why corporate recruitment is generally limited to large organizations\nwith a countrywide/worldwide presence that need regular hiring services. ****\n\n## **What Is a Corporate Recruiter\u2019s Job Description?**\n\nAs an organization looking to hire corporate recruiters, ensure that the job\ndescription outlines the company\u2019s current size and future goals. It should\ninclude the ideal candidate profile, a breakdown of specific tasks they will\nhave to perform daily, their eligibility criteria, and a skill set as precise\nas possible. For example, you may be looking for someone with 5+ years of\nrecruitment experience, familiarity with key hiring technologies, and\npreferably, industry-specific knowledge.\n\n### **Daily responsibilities**\n\n  \nA corporate recruiter\u2019s daily responsibilities include:\n\n**1\\. Networking and stakeholder interactions:** Corporate recruiters will\nregularly meet external staffing or recruitment process outsourcing companies,\nrepresentatives from digital hiring platforms, and trade union leaders. They\nwill also contact people from educational institutes and others to expand the\ncompany\u2019s professional network.\n\n**2\\. Job posting:** Creating job posts and distributing them intelligently\nacross platforms is integral to a corporate recruiter\u2019s job. Here, they work\nclosely with different line managers and regional heads to identify the\ndescription of the role being hired for and consolidate hiring efforts.\n\n**3\\. Passive candidate search:** Corporate recruiters are also expected to\nkeep an eye on third-party databases and social media to find high-potential\npassive candidates. They can then use recruitment marketing to target and\nconvert this segment.\n\n**4\\. Terms negotiation:** Your company may or may not have a dedicated team\nto negotiate terms, create offers, and confirm the finalized agreement with\ncandidates. Either way, the corporate recruiter acts as the point of contact,\nengaging in the entire **[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/) **process.\n\n**5\\. Relocation management:** This is critical for large companies that\nfrequently relocate candidates across cities or even countries. The recruit\nmust be assimilated into their new location, often with housing and living\nassistance, and it is the corporate recruiter who will handle relocation for\nthe new hire.\n\n**6\\. Data analysis:** A significant portion of the recruitment process is now\nautomated. The corporate recruiter monitors these systems and collects data to\ngenerate reports. These reports are then shared with talent acquisition\nstakeholders and business leaders to optimize the **[corporate recruitment\nstrategy](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-3-innovative-corporate-recruitment-strategies-for-2019/)**.\n\nThese are some of the responsibilities that you\u2019ll find in any corporate\nrecruiter\u2019s job description. And to perform this role, five essential\neligibility criteria may be required.\n\n### **Eligibility criteria**\n\n  \n**1\\. 2\u20135 years of experience:** Unlike a headhunter or a recruiter at a\nstaffing agency, corporate recruiters must possess a good level of hiring\nexperience. However, this need not be at a previous corporate recruitment job.\nGeneral recruitment may also suffice.\n\n**2\\. A degree in human resources (HR):** Corporate recruiters typically\npossess a graduate degree in HR or an equivalent earned via mid-career\neducational courses. But someone with years of experience or promising\npotential who does not have an HR degree can also be hired as a corporate\nrecruiter.\n\n**3\\. Technical skills:** Experience in or knowledge of using platforms such\nas **[applicant tracking\nsystems](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\napplicant-tracking-systems/) (ATS)**, candidate relationship management\nsoftware, recruitment marketing tools, **[human resource information\nsystems](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/) (HRIS)**, etc. are now a staple in a corporate recruiter\u2019s\njob description.\n\n**4\\. Soft skills:** Corporate recruiters must regularly work with other\nstakeholders inside and outside the company, not to mention engage with\ncandidates. That\u2019s why soft skills such as communication, conflict resolution,\nproblem-solving, and teamwork are essential to their role.\n\n**5\\. A robust professional network:** Corporate recruiters at leading\ncompanies typically have an impressive professional network in their own\nright, i.e., a robust social media presence (especially on LinkedIn and\nFacebook). Companies may look for candidates who have these networks and can\nleverage them for their hiring requirements.\n\nAnother key element to look out for in a job description is the salary. How\nmuch a corporate recruiter makes varies from company to company, given the\ncomplexity of their duties and their critical role in overall business\nsuccess. However, four different components make up the final compensation.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Talent Acquisition vs. Recruitment - Key Differences and\nSimilarities**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-vs-recruitment/)\n\n## **How Much Does a Corporate Recruiter Make?**\n\nWhile a corporate recruiter is definitely a salaried employee, there are\nseveral components to their compensation package. Briefly, this includes:\n\n**1\\. Basic salary:** This makes up the lion\u2019s share, comprising a steady\namount that\u2019s paid to the recruiter every month. Regardless of the number of\nemployees they hire or business profitability, corporate recruiters will earn\nthis basic salary.\n\n**2\\. Commission:** Apart from the basic salary, corporate recruiters can get\nadditional payment based on the number of employees they successfully hire\nover a specific period. Remember, this isn\u2019t a mandatory component, and\nseveral companies opt for a \u201cbasic salary only\u201d model.\n\n**3\\. Performance bonus:** Just like any other full-time job, corporate\nrecruiters can have a bonus amount specified in their employment terms. If\ntheir performance meets the requisite criteria (this refers to more than just\nthe number of employees onboarded), they may or may not receive a bonus.\n\n**4\\. Profit share:** In companies where corporate recruiters are instrumental\nto business growth, they might claim a percentage of the profits as part of\ntheir compensation package. For example, a technology company where the\ncorporate recruiter can demonstrate their contribution to revenues may offer\nthis amount.\n\nThe basic salary, followed by the commission, forms almost the entire job\nrecruiter\u2019s salary. According to payscale.com, this stands at an average of\n$58,200 every year in the U.S.1 Of course, this depends on the level of\nexperience \u2013 someone with 1\u20134 years of experience will bring in approximately\n$53,000, while those with 20+ years in the business can make upwards of\n$70,000.\n\nInterestingly, $10,137 of this $58,200 average is made up of commissions.\n\nIn the U.K., a senior recruiter earns a salary of \u00a339,543 per year, reports\nindeed.co.uk.2\n\n## **What Key Skills Must Corporate Recruiter Possess in 2020?**\n\nCorporate recruitment is now a rapidly evolving space, requiring a fresh skill\nset from professionals every year. The rules of engagement that were\napplicable five years back are no longer relevant \u2013 which is why corporate\nrecruiters are continually looking to upskill and reskill themselves. Here are\nfour areas that will garner the most attention in 2020:\n\n### **1\\. Industry knowledge**\n\n  \nTo find candidates that meet the specific skill requirements of a job,\ncorporate recruiters need working knowledge of the industry in which they\noperate. This will help to understand line managers\u2019 exact requirements better\nand translate them into job posts.\n\nIn this case, professionals from a non-HR background may also find their way\ninto corporate recruitment in 2020. For example, a software developer who\nworked at a product startup for two years and then put in another year at a\nstaffing agency could be the perfect candidate as a corporate recruiter for a\nglobal technology company.\n\n### **2\\. Marketing prowess**\n\n  \nIn a candidate-centric world, job seekers are almost like customers for\norganizations. That\u2019s why **top-of-the-funnel recruitment often involves\nmarketing techniques, with digital advertisements, social media posts,\nbranding, email automation, and chatbots**.\n\nSo, someone from a marketing background with strong people skills can fit\nright into the corporate recruiter\u2019s role. Those already employed in HR\npositions will need to brush up on their marketing skills, especially in\nsocial media.\n\n### **3\\. Compliance awareness**\n\n  \nWith GDPR now applicable to any company that works with EU citizens, security\nknow-how is a definite bonus. Recently, the state of California also\nintroduced the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) to help consumers gain\nmore control over how their information is used.3\n\nCorporate recruitment involves collecting, storing, and utilizing vast\nrepositories of candidate data. Someone with knowledge of local and global\nsecurity laws can help to navigate this thorny landscape, ensuring their\ncompanies are always on the right side of compliance.\n\n### **4\\. Data literacy**\n\n  \nWith analytics now becoming critical for the talent acquisition function,\ncorporate recruiters must be able to analyze and interpret data. They should\nbe able to suggest strategic moves informed by data to senior hiring managers,\nhelping to optimize talent acquisition in the long term. Today, nearly every\nSaaS-based recruitment tool comes equipped with an analytics module \u2013\ncorporate recruiters must keep an eye on these analytics insights and practice\ndata-driven recruitment to be truly successful in 2020.\n\n### **5\\. Gen Z understanding**\n\n  \nGeneration Z is now entering the workforce in droves. Corporate recruiters\nmust understand the needs, wants, and objectives of this generation to engage\nwith them on a deeper level. This **segment is hugely value-centric and won't\nhesitate to abandon an offer** if it perceives a better opportunity elsewhere.\nCorporate recruiters should be able to sustain these young professionals\u2019\ninterests through the full-cycle recruitment process, even if it takes several\nweeks.\n\n### **6\\. Diversity training**\n\n  \nIn 2020, every corporate recruiter must be trained in diversity & inclusion\n(D&I;) policies, helping their companies to build a more inclusive workplace.\nDiversity begins at the hiring stage \u2013 by ensuring a level playing field for\nall candidates, corporate recruiters can significantly aid their company\u2019s\nD&I; initiatives. The increasing popularity of diversity hiring strategies\nwill make this skill even more necessary in the new year.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Top 10 Recruitment Software and Tools for\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nrecruitment-software-technology/)\n\n## **Innovation Is Central to the Future of Corporate Recruitment**\n\nTruly effective hiring isn\u2019t about maintaining the status quo \u2013 it must\nachieve the objective of adding to your culture and business capabilities with\nevery recruit. For this reason, corporate recruiters must bring an accurate\nunderstanding of the as-is company landscape, as well as a bold assessment of\nwhere it is headed.\n\nBy combining their expert knowledge of the hiring process with the latest\ndigital tools, corporate recruiters are poised to take their companies to new\nheights. This will be critical as we enter a new era in **[talent\nacquisition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-acquisition/)**, marked by candidate centricity,\ncontinuous engagement, and tech-enabled hiring.\n\n_Do you expect a fresh addition to a corporate recruiter\u2019s job description in\n2020?

Sell employee experience and culture\n\nMarketing employee experience tops the list of recruiting ideas for 2020. With\nthe candidate-driven market in full effect, you need to [market your company's\nemployee\nexperience](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/10-ingredients-in-\na-killer-employee-experience-strategy) benefits to gain a competitive edge.\n\nBeing proactive is key since candidates turn to sites such as Glassdoor to see\ncurrent and past employee reviews on issues such as culture and work-life\nbalance. You can get one step ahead by monitoring job satisfaction sites and\nresponding to both positive and negative feedback. This shows that your\ncompany truly cares about employees and potential employees. Creating videos\nand posts that show employees involved in events and clubs is another way to\nshow off your company's culture. You can even consider posting interviews\nwhere employees explain why they like working at the company and what their\njobs entail. This insider look can help give your company a reputation as a\ngreat place to work and attract both active and passive candidates.\n\n### __2\\. Get serious about social recruiting\n\nUsing social media in service of recruiting is important in both a general way\n-- as part of selling employee experience -- and as a means to market specific\njob openings. Don't just use social media in an intermittent or a reactive\nway; get strategic about using it to recruit talent. A cornerstone of any\n[social recruiting\nstrategy](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Recruiting-with-\nsocial-media-Tips-tools-and-challenges) is determining how to use each social\nmedia platform. For example, to reach potential candidates you'll likely want\nto tailor communication differently for Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. You\ncan post tailored career pages on these sites, promote specific jobs,\nhighlight features of specific jobs and call out diversity efforts. You can\nalso hunt for candidates using tools such as LinkedIn Recruiter and post to\njob sites such as Indeed.\n\nYou can promote recruiting events and meetups online. Launching an engaging\nsocial media campaign helps to draw in top talent and encourages them to\napproach you. In particular, this approach can help attract younger\ncandidates.\n\n### __3\\. Write an honest job listing\n\nThe ability to write job listings that truly convey what's in store for\ncandidates is a fundamental component of recruitment marketing.\n\nIf a candidate applies for a position that isn't right for them, they will not\nbe happy and may not stay in the job for very long. Instead of just trying to\ndraw in any candidate, know your candidate personas and write for the ones\nthat will be right for the job.\n\nIt's also important to proactively troubleshoot for issues such as potentially\n[biased job listings](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Why-\nreducing-hiring-bias-isnt-easy) or discriminatory practices. Try to avoid\nusing wording that may alienate any gender, religious or ethnic group, and\nunderstand that unconscious bias makes this difficult. To help, companies can\nuse technology to detect biases. Software tools, such as Textio and SAP\napplications, comb through job ads and highlight problematic wording.\n\n### __4\\. Deploy technology strategically\n\nConsidering AI recruiting tools should definitely be among the top 2020\nrecruiting ideas. They can streamline potential candidate identification, give\nrecruiters more time for interviewing and relationship-building, and [create a\nmore positive candidate\nexperience](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Clarity-key-to-\nSouthwest-Airlines-smooth-candidate-experience) from the beginning of the\nrecruiting process through hiring. For example, some AI recruiting tools can\nhelp identify desirable traits, quickly search through candidates to identify\nthe ones with the right skills for a certain position.\n\nHowever, AI-based recruiting tools [can pose\nissues](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252472497/A-backlash-\nemerges-over-automated-interviewing), including biased selection. Make sure\nthe right people take charge of investigating any AI black-box issues and that\nthe technology is helping, instead of hurting, the hiring process.\n\n### __5\\. Use analytics to measure recruiting strategy success\n\nWhen thinking of recruiting ideas for 2020, [analytics should be in the top\nfive](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/3-ways-\npredictive-analytics-is-changing-recruitment-practices/) because you'll need\nto understand if your strategies are actually working.\n\nVendors are introducing an increasing number of recruiting analytics tools for\nthe hiring process. These tools can help spot trends and then make predictions\nand recommendations for the company to use going forward. This keeps track of\nrecruiting efforts so HR teams can see if what they are doing is successful.\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on HR and artificial intelligence\n\n  * [\n\n##### Top 2020 HR trends: Employee and candidate experience, AI and more\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/daniel_diann.jpg) By: Diann\nDaniel ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Top-7-HR-trends-\nfor-2020-and-beyond-The-change-decade)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Top 3 ways talent pros can adapt to changing recruitment trends\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/meltzer_rachel.jpg) By: Rachel\nMeltzer ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Top-3-ways-talent-\npros-can-adapt-to-changing-recruitment-trends)\n\n  * [\n\n##### As politics heat up, so do hiring bias worries\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252474224/As-\npolitics-heat-up-so-do-hiring-bias-worries)\n\n  * [\n\n##### HR technology startups vie for top spot at Unleash conferences\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/jones_katherine_02.jpg) By:\nKatherine Jones ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/HR-\ntechnology-startups-vie-for-top-spot-at-Unleash-conferences)\n\n  * [![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/meltzer_rachel.jpg)](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Rachel-Meltzer)\n\n[Rachel Meltzer](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Rachel-Meltzer) asks:\n\n## How can you use these recruitment marketing ideas to help you find\ncandidates?\n\n__\n\nJoin the Discussion\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [The Economic and Employee Benefits of a Flexible Working Environment](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/The-Economic-and-Employee-Benefits-of-a-Flexible-Working-Environment) -Citrix\n  * [Digital Workspaces of the Future: Technology that Serves the People, Not Vice ...](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/Digital-Workspaces-of-the-Future-Technology-that-Serves-the-People-Not-Vice-Versa) -Citrix\n  * [The Well-Trod Path From Application Virtualization to People-Centric Digital ...](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/The-Well-Trod-Path-From-Application-Virtualization-to-People-Centric-Digital-Workspaces) -Citrix\n  * [See More](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/sponsored_communities)\n\n__Related Content\n\n  * [Top 2020 HR trends: Employee and candidate experience...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Top-7-HR-trends-for-2020-and-beyond-The-change-decade) - SearchHRSoftware\n  * [AI improves the HR hiring process for recruiters, ...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/AI-improves-the-HR-hiring-process-for-recruiters-candidates) - SearchHRSoftware\n  * [Top 10 recruitment trends to implement in 2019 and ...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/Top-10-recruitment-trends-to-implement-in-2019-and-beyond) - SearchHRSoftware\n\n####  __Join the conversation\n\n###  __ 1 comment\n\nSend me notifications when other members comment.

The top channels for applications can be\ndifferent from the top channels for recruiting, that\u2019s why it\u2019s essential that\nyou\u2019ve got the right analytics and are not overinvesting into channels that\ndeliver many applicants, but no real hires.\n\nA few key channels for attracting candidates:\n\n## Career site\n\nThe ability to have regular communication about available job vacancies and to\neasily refer a friend or share jobs via social media on your website allows\nyou to reach eligible talent.\n\n## Job boards\n\nJob boards are also key sources of candidates. They allow you to discover the\nlatest opportunities that match your talent needs. Most job boards have latest\nsearching tools that help to identify the roles you\u2019re looking for.\n\n## Talent pools\n\nBuilding a pipeline of passive candidates, or keeping in touch with candidates\nwho have applied for roles in the past is a brilliant way to fill roles\nquickly, and at a lower cost. For startups that are serious about building a\ntalent pipeline, having a quick and easy way for candidates to apply, or get\nthe information they need to apply at home is important. Though job boards are\nstill popular, more and more candidates are approaching employers directly\nthrough the brand's careers site. Talent pools are increasingly a key source\nof candidates, as they deliver more hires.\n\n## Designing your hiring strategy\n\nDefining your recruitment strategy will help you invest in activities that\nlead to quality hires, faster. Businesses should familiarise themselves with\ndifferent technologies and strategies, and make a complete list of options,\ntheir benefits, and drawbacks.\n\nBased on the internal analysis and external market scan, find the recruiting\nstrategies that you would use in an ideal world to attract the best talent.\nPrioritise your strategy, taking into account the constraints that you are\noperating within. Consider how you can use an automated solution and diverse\nchannels for different roles to achieve the most impact. A robust recruitment\nsystem can streamline the recruiting process in many ways.\n\nAs features include posting jobs to job boards, bulk sorting and responding to\napplicants, building passive and active talent pipelines and even onboarding\nand succession planning, the software saves HR recruiters time which can be\ninvested in more strategic work. Also, the solution facilitates more efficient\nprocesses for your recruitment team, from bulk actions to send unsuccessful\ncommunications through to scheduling group and individual interviews and\nissuing job offers. As technology evolves, comprehensive platforms are\navailable which integrate with other business systems and compliance\nplatforms.\n\n## Choosing the right HR technology for your business\n\nChoosing a solution for your talent management process can be daunting. The\ntime required for implementations and the cost of the software can be\nsignificant. But the return on investment is also crucial, not only in\nbusiness savings but also in enhanced candidate and HR staff experience. Here,\nwe shed light on a few considerations for choosing the right recruitment\nsystem for your business:\n\n **Cloud-based Technology**\n\nTechnology is constantly changing, the way it is impacting the HR solution is\nalso notably significant. Traditional software applications in the recruitment\nprocess will not be able to meet the talent demands of tomorrow. The solution\nyou select should be flexible to meet present and future business needs. A\ncloud-based system allows you to access what you need, when you need it, no\nmatter where you are in the world.\n\n **Mobile Apps**\n\nSelect a unified recruitment platform that delivers one consistent experience\nand make sure it works well on the candidate\u2019s side. Many organisations don\u2019t\nhave a mobile-optimised careers website. Getting this right can differentiate\nyou from your competitors, especially when hiring millennials.\n\n **Integrations**\n\nChoose an application that integrates with specialist providers, job boards,\nand social media channels. This will rationalise your processes and enable you\nto attract talent through a range of channels.\n\n **Business Brand**\n\nEnsure you have access to hiring marketing capabilities that allow you to\npromote your employment brand to top talent and attract them to work with you.\n\n **User Experience**\n\nAny system you implement must be user-friendly for the stakeholder of the\nrecruitment process and make it easy for them to attract, recruit and manage\ntalent.\n\n **Inbuilt Analytics**\n\nAnalytics is now a key driver in the overall recruitment process,\nsignificantly redefining hiring practices. They should be embedded in your\nrecruitment system to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of your\npractices and support strategic decision making.\n\n **Effective Onboarding**\n\nOnboarding should begin the moment a candidate accepts an offer. An online\nonboarding and learning system allows candidates to turn up on their first day\nhaving completed their paperwork and online learning modules.\n\n **Security**\n\nLook for a solution provider that has Security Certifications for their\nproduct. The controls they put into practice should be externally audited at\nleast once a year. Also, verify the scope of the certification: it can apply\nto an entire product or just particular modules. The entire platform should be\ncertified.\n\n **Support**\n\nEven with the most user-friendly system, you will need help from time to time.\nPoor customer support can cause expensive delays in the hiring process,\nincreasing the time to hire and keep your team from fulfilling their goals.\nWhether it\u2019s a training program to introduce recruiters to a new system or\ntroubleshooting an issue, the software provider should offer timely and\neffective support.\n\n## Cost\n\nTake your time to explore different options available, make the most of free\ntrials if they\u2019re offered and choose recruitment system that offers the best\nvalue for your money.\n\nFinding the best talent takes time, but with the right approach, organisations\ncan attract quantity and quality without paying inflated advertising costs. In\nfact, by streamlining their approach to hiring and using the right technology,\nbusinesses can increase the quality and quantity of new hires and save money.\nA cloud-based solution like SutiHR can streamline the entire employee\nlifecycle, from the job posting to onboarding, performance reviews, training &\ndevelopment.\n\n _Charles Harden, freelance content writer,_[\n_SutiHR_](https://www.sutihr.com/) _  \nImage source: Shutterstock/Trueffelpix_\n\n### Topics\n\n[recruiting](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/recruiting/)\n\n[software](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/software/)\n\n[talent](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/talent/)\n\n[sourcing](https://www.itproportal.com/tag/sourcing/)\n\n__Get Weekly News and Analysis\n\nSign up below to get the latest from ITProPortal, plus exclusive special\noffers, direct to your inbox!\n\nNo spam, we promise.

This includes cloud computing solutions,\nhub technologies, artificial intelligence, people analytics, process\nautomation, the Internet of Things (IoT), and predictive analytics. How\nindividuals interact with technology, along with the new tools at our\ndisposal, is changing how we work. HR can\u2019t sit idly by; it must help drive\nthe transformation. Yet making sense of the implications for HR is no simple\ntask.\n\nWalking the floor at the 2019 HR Tech Conference and Expo, we overheard some\nconsistent themes from HR professionals in attendance. The overwhelming number\nof vendors and point solutions meant more, not less, uncertainty when it comes\nto determining where they should invest. Many struggled to find value in the\nhuman capital management systems already in place; there were questions about\nwhat solution would work best given their circumstances, and who within the\norganization was making the decisions. In many instances, it seemed that the\nentire process of deciding on the right technology was in the hands of IT,\nrather than HR.\n\nConference attendees express a consistent need to do a better job of taking\nthe multitude of disparate, inflexible platforms that make up current HR\nservice delivery and find ways to tie these together to create a more\ncompelling employee experience and to make it easier for HR teams to integrate\nplatforms so they can be more productive. It\u2019s about simplifying the complex.\nThis need for a consistent employee experience \u2013 every touchpoint between HR\nprograms and the individual employee - aligned with the employer\u2019s distinct\nEmployee Value Proposition, seemed to be the Holy Grail of the conference\nexperience.\n\nSo how can organizations make sense of this bewildering technological market?\nI believe the answer is to focus on the three most useful and promising\ntechnologies that HR can use to make smarter decisions faster.\n\n### **Hub Technologies: Centering the experience around the individual**\n\n  \nTo keep the \u201chuman\u201d in HR, technology should focus on helping individuals make\ninformed decisions about the rewards and development programs available to\nthem.\n\nOrganizations clearly want the best talent possible to deliver on their\nmission. When done right, that mission is tied directly to its unique employee\nvalue proposition (EVP). There\u2019s no such thing as a cookie-cutter approach for\ndeveloping an EVP \u2013 every organization must differentiate its strategy based\non its unique brand and a sense of purpose. Likewise, there\u2019s no such thing as\na \u201cbest practice\u201d for adopting HR technologies relevant to specific\norganizations.\n\nNo two employers have the same talent goals, so the right ecosystem for one\norganization may not be right for the next. A global software developer has\nvery different HR needs from a mid-sized Midwestern manufacturer. While there\nare plenty of behind-the-scenes processes and transactions that are similar\nfor both, the need to entice and motivate talent requires a very organization-\nspecific mix of employee-facing technologies.\n\nAlong with creating a unique EVP, there are millions of distinct employee\nexpectations. The best employee experience is designed for every individual we\nserve, which demands that we treat each one uniquely, using communication\nchannels, content, tone, and data aligned with each person\u2019s expectations.\n\nHuman-centered design, the process of building out the full user (in this\ncase, employee) experience based on the people you\u2019re designing for, and\nending with interactions that are tailor-made to suit their needs, helps to\nachieve this audience-of-one focus. A generic approach can be valuable for\ntop-down communication, but not much else. Even persona-driven models that\nhelp narrow the ideal experience still run the risk of being overly\nstereotyped. Personalized models assure individual data, including past\ninteractions, is used to create a meaningful employee experience with the\nright messaging and tone, delivered via the right channel.\n\nContextual experience \u2013 serving up the right content at the right time -\nprovides the added benefit of drawing only on _relevant_ work and life events\nfor a hyper-personalized approach. The more contextual, and therefore more\nvaluable to the individual, the more likely the communication will deliver the\ndesired results, for both the employee and the organization.\n\nThe advent of hub technologies, coupled with tailored employer branding and\nback-end analytics, helps both employers and employees stay the course for\nimproved performance and better outcomes for all. As artificial intelligence\nsystems \u201clearn\u201d more about the individual\u2019s preferences (through machine\nlearning), the technology adapts to the personal preferences of the individual\nregardless of the systems running in the background. This is where companies\ncan best adapt their vendor selection strategy: keeping the employee\nexperience relevant while maintaining consistent process flow and metrics.\n\n### **People Analytics: Improving people and business performance**\n\n  \nPeople analytics is now the lifeblood of HR\u2019s role in workforce planning.\nMeasuring and analyzing this slice of \u201cbig data\u201d\u2014data on performance,\ncompensation, demographics, career history, benefits, employee behaviors, time\nutilization, and attrition\u2014can help identify workforce patterns and talent\nrisks, forecast productivity, address recruitment and retention challenges,\ncapture ROI from HR initiatives, and uncover leadership opportunities that\ncould otherwise be missed.\n\nPeople analytics is also collapsing the narrow siloes of talent, benefits,\nwellness, or population health, bringing them all together to intersect and\nimpact the employee experience and benefit the individual.\n\n### **Predictive Analytics: The power of insight**\n\n  \nClosely aligned with people, analytics is the power of looking into the\nfuture: predictive analytics. Workforce data gives HR and business leaders the\nability to make evidence-based decisions to address and improve turnover\ntrends, retain high performers, forecast talent needs, and even anticipate\nlegal risks with poor performers. More the predictive analytics guide the\norganization in selecting and developing its talent, rewards, and HR programs,\nthe better the results for both the company and the individual.\n\nOrganizations that took our [Global Wellbeing\nSurvey](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__content.buck.com_working-2Dwell-2Dglobal-2Dsurvey-2Dof-2Dworkforce-2Dstrategies&d=DwMFaQ&c=9wxE0DgWbPxd1HCzjwN8Eaww1\n--ViDajIU4RXCxgSXE&r=tLT_yNhQo0KunNn7QxL-\nOmi122ic3DN53x7UXHir3Vg&m=jWz9vjRygNrctxedb3c5-_EVz5UZmFQNYTS3WV4A61E&s=eR0oM0adZcs8DigTmnH8fkFVNXRdkQ5wb3oOqQMTjsM&e=)\nreleased earlier this year rated the effectiveness of predictive analytics at\nan incredible 84%. But given the high cost of this investment, it\u2019s critical\nthat HR and IT work together to include a number of scenarios across the full\nrange of business needs, not just predicting isolated hiring and development\nneeds.\n\n### **Cutting through the noise**\n\n  \nThere are many HR technologies and services on the market. It\u2019s critical never\nto lose sight of the goal: technology should be able to help companies \u2013 and\ntheir employees \u2013 make smarter decisions, faster. Administrative platforms\nrunning behind the scenes should have as their goal improving business\ndecisions and corporate outcomes. Employee-facing systems need to support the\nways people actually use their benefits, track progress in meeting their\ncareer goals, and engage with the ways the company bolsters the employee\nexperience across the health, wealth, and career spectrum.\n\n**Learn More:[20 HR Metrics You Need to Track in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/important-hr-\nmetrics/)**\n\nBut there\u2019s never an off-the-rack approach when it comes to engaging with\nemployees, and HR leaders need to evaluate their infrastructure and unique\nchallenges continuously. Each organization has distinct needs that, once\nclearly identified, should point to the technology that will best address\nthose needs.\n\nMany of the conference attendees we met embraced the model of pulling the\nentire HR tech landscape together for the organization, through the powerful\nanalytics tools we\u2019ve been talking about. They hold on to the dream that\npeople and business decisions can be made with all relevant data aggregated.\nThat speaks to the need for HR to take the lead in helping IT see the value of\nfull people data analysis.\n\nAligning the personal needs of employees with the business needs of the\norganization \u2013 the social contract \u2013 is indispensable to achieving success for\nboth workers and employers. For HR in the throes of figuring out the best\ntechnology to use, it\u2019s the only strategy that will pay off.\n\n**Learn More:[7 Sentiment Analysis Tools to Improve Employee Engagement in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/sentiment-\nanalytics-tools-features-price/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Making+Sense+of+HR+Tech+in+2020\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Making+Sense+of+HR+Tech+in+2020&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Making Sense of HR Tech in\n2020&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Fhr-\nanalytics%2Fmaking-sense-of-hr-tech-\nin-2021%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [HR Analytics ](/category/hr-analytics/ \"HR Analytics\")\n\n  * [ ![What Is People Analytics?

Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\nIn a new checklist, cut-e has put together [35 guidelines for introducing fair\nrecruitment practices](http://www.cut-e.com/diversity) which promote diversity\nand inclusion, of which we've compiled nine below.\n\nThe document provides advice on conducting an objective job analysis;\npreparing a fair job description; defining job-related selection criteria;\ncreating non-discriminatory job advertisements; running consistent job\ninterviews and assessment centres, and communicating with candidates.\n\n**Dr Achim Preuss, managing director of cut-e** , said: \"Recruiters know that\ndiversity and inclusion can enhance innovation, adaptability and performance,\nso they\u2019re keen to appoint a broad range of talented people based on their\npotential, regardless of their ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, class,\nphysical abilities, age or religion.\"\n\nHave a look at some of the guidelines below:\n\n  1. In the [job description](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/job-descriptions-clear-enough-candidates/ \"Are your job descriptions clear enough for candidates?\"), use male and female personal pronouns (he/she\u2026) or re-write the job description so that it is gender-neutral.\n  2. Avoid using photos on adverts as they may discriminate if only (or mostly) individuals of, for example, [one gender or ethnicity are depicted](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/llaollao-apologises-discriminating-against-local-candidate/ \"llaollao apologises for discriminating against local candidate\") \u2013 and it can be difficult to find a truly representative image.\n  3. If [mentioning language requirements](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/oldtown-apologises-for-racist-job-advertisement/ \"OLDTOWN apologises for \u2018racist\u2019 job advertisement\"), be sure that they are relevant for the job and not simply a nice-to-have. If so, don\u2019t mention them.\n  4. Document the reasons you will use for [rejecting applicants](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/reject-candidate-tattoos/ \"Would you reject candidates because of their tattoos?\").\n  5. Avoid questions concerning the following topics (unless they are relevant for the job): disabilities, [pregnancy](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/alarming-rate-discrimination-hong-kong-offices/ \"\u201cAlarming\u201d rate of discrimination in Hong Kong offices\"), sexual orientation, religious beliefs or world view, age, race / ethnicity.\n  6. [Educate your recruiters](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/recruiters-heres-deal-unqualified-candidates/ \"Recruiters, here\u2019s how you deal with unqualified candidates\") with respect to local equality legislation and the implications for selection.\n  7. In a letter of rejection, ensure that the [reasons for not offering the position](http://www.humanresourcesonline.net/us-court-rules-banning-dreadlocks-workplace-discrimination/ \"Employer gets away with rejecting candidate over dreadlocks\") are communicated based solely on the job requirements.\n  8. Use online tests tailored to different educational backgrounds with respect to the language used and complexity (but of course use one and the same test for all applicants applying for one job).\n  9. In unsupervised settings, make sure online test takers cannot cheat (for example by using an item generator that creates a new test each time test takers log onto it).\n\nDownload the full checklist\n[here](http://www.cut-e.com/index.php?id=1711&dl=31929).\n\n_Photo /[123RF](http://www.123rf.com)_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

Get it right and companies can\nexpect to maximize ROI for technology and also mould their HR departments into\nstrategic business partners, writes Ken Charman is CEO of uFlexReward**_\n\nThe technology revolution that is currently underway in HR could be totally\nundermined if HR practitioners do not have the skills needed to make the most\nof new digital solutions.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834bf8d52f2.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nWhile HR is one of the last operational areas to see the full force of\ntechnology transformation, it is in the crosshairs of an increasing number of\nsoftware vendors. Technology strategists look at the outdated and manual\nprocesses that still occur across HR and Rewards as the perfect opportunity\nfor automation solutions. At the same time, organizations see the huge cost of\nresourcing and want to find new ways of recruiting and retaining employees,\nbuilding talent pools and maximizing their investments.\n\nWith digital transformation expected to strongly impact all areas of HR from\nthe nature of work, the future skills required for an organization\u2019s\nworkforce, to the delivery of reward, we are at the cusp of significant, even\ntransformative changes. However, understanding how specific digital solutions\naddress the individual requirements of your organization is vital. Even more\nimportant though is the need to ensure you are putting these technology\nsolutions in the hands of HR and reward leaders that can make the most of\nthem.\n\nThis will require a transformation in HR skills that is just as significant as\nany technology investment. Get it right and organizations can expect to not\nonly maximize ROI on the technology but also mould their HR departments into\nones that are strategic business partners responsible for significant impact\non the company\u2019s bottom line, and also with the analytic capability to\nunderstand and make sense of a greater degree of data in the future.\n\n## **The HR Technology Revolution Is Upon Us**\n\nOrganizations are investing more than ever in HR technology as vendors develop\nsolutions that incorporate a range of innovative technologies. In the last\nyear, [organizations have increased their investment in HR technology by\n29%](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/digital-transformation/bersin-\nlaunches-the-2019-hr-technology-market-report-heres-what-you-need-to-know/),\nresulting in the HR technology market growing by 10%.\n\nA range of trends are emerging, including the shift from engagement to\nproductivity in core systems, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the\nsignificance of gig workforce management.\n\nUnilever\u2019s use of AI is just one example of the change that is occurring. As a\nbusiness, it recruits more than 30,000 people a year and processes around 1.8\nmillion job applications. This obviously takes a lot of time and effort, so\nUnilever made use of AI in an online platform that enabled candidates to be\nassessed at home in front of a computer or mobile screen.\n\nWith the candidates asked to perform a series of tests, machine learning\nalgorithms then assessed their suitability for different roles, resulting in\n70,000 hours of interviews and assessments being saved from HR employees\u2019\ntime.\n\nApart from AI, another key area of innovation in this sector is HR analytics,\nwhich relates to the area of productivity. This emerging trend is a\nmethodology for creating insights on how investments in human capital assets\ncontribute to the success of an organization. This is done by applying\nstatistical methods to integrated HR, talent management, financial and\noperational data.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is Human Resource Development (HRD)? Definition,\nFunctions, and Best Practices for Training\nProgram](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\nhuman-resource-development/)**\n\n## **Tech Solutions Without Data Skills Are Pointless**\n\nWhile these solutions and the results they produce will sound very tempting to\nChief Human Resource Officers (CHROs), companies should tread carefully in\ntheir vendor selection process.\n\nThe most important first step is to identify what the company really needs,\nrather than be sold the benefits of a particular technology. Practitioner-led\nsolutions, which have been built and are maintained by professionals with real\nHR industry experience, are usually the best option for organizations that\ndon\u2019t fully understand which solution fits their needs.\n\nThis consultative approach shouldn\u2019t end with sales and onboarding either. The\nbest practitioners will understand the importance of upskilling HR teams to\nmake the most of the new technology that should become a fundamental part of\nan HR employee\u2019s job.\n\n[Recent research from the CIPD](https://www.cipd.co.uk/Images/people-\nanalytics-report_tcm18-43755.pdf) on people analytics shows how important this\nupskilling will be. At present, only half (54%) of companies think their HR\nteam has demonstrable numerical and statistical skills. In addition, only 40%\nthink those teams are able to tackle organization issues using analytics data.\n\nData science skills will play an increasingly important role within\norganizations that invest in the new wave of HR technologies, as these\norganizations look to make the most of their investments. That means having\nintellectually curious people who can interrogate and interpret the data,\ndeciphering where it has come from, what it tells them and what the anomalies\nare.\n\nOnce the skills are in place within the HR team, the next area ripe for\ndistribution is rewards. So much of HR analysis is linked to productivity,\nattraction, motivation, and retention which are all linked too, and very\ndependent on the reward. Yet, the traditional reward model of fixed structures\nand pay ranges within an organization does not easily lend itself to the\nadaptability and flexibility the future \u2018digital workforce\u2019 will require.\n\nThe absence of any system capable of consolidating and analyzing global reward\ndata, on a granular, employee-level, is a data gap that needs to be resolved,\nespecially for global organizations that require consistency in rewards across\nfunctions and countries.\n\nWorking with Unilever for seven years to build such a system to consolidate\nand analyze global reward data has made the reward more engaging and relevant\nfor employees. Unilever are now able to experiment with the data to truly\nunderstand what motivates their employees which will lead to greater employee\nretention and address a number of other workplace requirements, that soon will\nbecome mandatory for organizations like the gender pay gap, diversity\nreporting and more.\n\n## **Data-Driven HR Will Power Organization Transformation**\n\nThe benefits of this upskilling will not be limited to making the most of new\ntechnology either. By introducing data science as a core skill within HR\ndepartments, organizations can change their employees from people managers to\nbusiness strategists.\n\nThe HR professionals of the future will be advising organizations on\neverything from pay ratio adjustments and cost-effective locations to\nborderless workforces. This will be possible because they are able to act on\nthe data at their fingertips, developing interpretable models and explainable\nanalytical results that win over the confidence of key decision-makers.\n\nThis type of technology transformation within HR departments may seem like\nit's a long way off for some organizations, and achieving this change alone\ncould feel like a major success. However, once that first milestone has been\npassed, it cannot be a one-off event.\n\n**Learn More:[Automation Technology Makes Human Resources More\n\u2018Human\u2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/automation-technology-makes-human-resources-more-human/)**\n\nThe technology skills of today are attainable for anyone wanting to transform\ntheir career but these skills are also finite in their relevance. In fact, the\nhalf-life of a technology skill is thought to be just two years. Therefore\nindividuals will need to constantly refresh the ones they have, even if they\nhave only just been learned.\n\nThis will result in a bigger emphasis on relevant skills as opposed to years\nof experience when deciding how valuable an employee is, particularly as the\nopen marketplace for global talent expands.

experience: Mobility best practices\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n### Priya Sunil _takes a look at how HR leaders at KONE, Lendlease, and TDCX,\nare supporting their expat employees on their assignment journeys._\n\nIn the 2003 movie _Lost in Translation_ , protagonist Bob Harris, an ageing\nAmerican movie star, is sent on an overseas assignment to Japan to film a\nwhisky ad. He is lost and confused, feeling very out of place as he tries to\nsoak up an entirely different culture.\n\nThrough the movie, he finds himself learning new things about the Japanese\nculture every day, and slowly embraces the challenges brought about from this\nmove, all with the support of his team and the locals he meets along the way.\n\nSimilar to Harris' experience, many mobile assignees in today\u2019s workforce are\nbound to feel disoriented when first posted to a new country. In an ideal\nscenario, much before this happens, HR and mobility leaders play a critical\nrole in ensuring a smooth end-to-end process for their settling-in for a\nsuccessful overall assignment.\n\nAs **Lucy Tan, Chief Human Resources Officer at NatSteel Holdings** , shares\nfrom her experience leading such assignments, it is important the team looks\ninto potential assignees' needs and caters to these needs as much as possible,\nas well as provides constant check-ins so they feel well-supported and\nmotivated while away from home.\n\nIn light of this, and more, in this feature, we take a look at what HR leaders\nat KONE, Lendlease and TDCX are doing to support their expat employees on\ntheir assignment journeys, including their must-haves when choosing the best\naccommodation.\n\n### **Encouraging job rotations at KONE**\n\nAt elevator and escalator company KONE, one of the ways it encourages\nemployees\u2019 personal and professional growth is through active job rotation\nacross different offices. According to **Minna Rouru, Area HR Director, Asia\nPacific** _(pictured above, far right)_ , these international assignments and\ntransfers provide employees with a possibility to work abroad, and a great\nopportunity to learn more about the company\u2019s customers, markets, different\ncultures as well as to help transfer knowledge.\n\nShe explains: \"At KONE, the global mobility policy is the backbone for the\nprinciples of our mobility programme here in Asia.\n\n> ##### KONE has an interest in family circumstances of our employees and as\n> each employee's personal circumstances may be different, we are willing to\n> make the necessary adjustments.\n\nFor instance, on the employee's part, the HR team expects full and frank\ndisclosure of any personal matters that may affect the success of the\nassignment to make the necessary considerations based on family circumstances.\n\nAdditionally, each assignee and the spouse goes through an expatriate\nassessment that is based on data gathered through interviews and assessment\nmethods, including reasoning tests, work simulations, and work-related\npersonality inventories.\n\n\"The report of the assessment reflects the person\u2019s current priorities and\napproach to work, which helps the assignee identify their strengths and\ndevelopment areas. It also supports them with cultural fit,\" Rouru says.\n\n\"From a recruiting point of view, our business strategy, workforce planning,\nand budget are important in supporting the understanding of employee needs in\nour different markets.\"\n\nThe company currently has about 80 long-term international assignees globally,\nwith a majority based in Asia Pacific. Additionally, there are intra-regional\ntransfers within the region and local hires from abroad, posted either to or\nfrom Asia Pacific countries.\n\nAs every HR leader dealing with mobility would know, some of the typical\nissues faced when mobilising an employee include immigration-related issues\nsuch as long work permit processing times.\n\n\"This needs the support and co-operation from the business units to understand\nthat processing times may take longer than usual. This is a frequent scenario\nwhere the need for the new talent by the business was just 'yesterday'.\"\n\nOn how KONE tackles this, she adds: \"It\u2019s important to be realistic from the\nbeginning to manage expectations. We always work with business units to ensure\nthey factor in a reasonable amount of time required from the time they request\nfor an assignee until the time the assignee can start work.\"\n\nOnce an employee has completed an international assignment, the company\nconducts a survey to gather their feedback on the different stages of their\njourney. How has the feedback been so far? \"We have generally received very\npositive feedback from our assignees and any potential issues raised are used\nto better develop our mobility programme.\"\n\nMoving forward, she and her team aim to further develop KONE's short-term job\nrotation policy in the Asia Pacific region.\n\n### Dropping cookie-cutter mobility policies at Lendlease\n\nIn an increasingly global and interconnected world, companies are recognising\nthe value of international exposure in filling senior and critical positions.\n\nIn line with that, Lendlease's **Head of People & Culture for Asia, Vicki Ng\n**_(pictured above, far left)_ , shares that aspiring leaders in the\ninternational property and infrastructure group's Asia arm are given such\nexposure through its global Talent Export Programme.\n\nUnder this programme, the company's high-performing, high-potential employees\nare deployed on a two-year overseas assignment, before returning home to\n\"drive the growth of the business\".\n\nCurrent participants in this programme, which include analysts, as well as\ndevelopment and project managers, have been posted to major cities such as San\nFrancisco, London, Tokyo and Sydney.\n\n\"With such a diverse mobile talent pool, cookie-cutter mobility programmes can\nno longer satisfy everyone's needs. As such, our mobility framework is\ndesigned to provide the flexibility that can cater to individuals\u2019 needs and\nenhance the employee experience,\" she says.\n\nFor example, she shares that employees who prefer a DIY approach can choose\ncash options in lieu of company-organised relocation support.\n\nNg also believes in order to ensure the mobility assignment is a smooth\nprocess, it is essential the selected employees have the right values,\naptitude and mindset to make the most of the opportunity.\n\n\"We ensure the assignees are thoroughly briefed prior to relocation so they\nare prepared for the challenges they might face in living and working\noverseas.\"\n\nDuring such assignments, one key challenge she has observed in assignees is\nthe challenge of maintaining a relationship with the business at home, and re-\nassimilating into the environment when they return.\n\nTo address this, each of them is assigned a mentor, who is a senior leader\nwithin the Asian business, under the Talent Export Programme. These mentors\nregularly check in with the assignees on their development progress and\nprovide coaching and guidance throughout the assignment.\n\nFurther, she adds: \"There is also a strong partnership between the Asia\nleadership team, the people and culture team, and the home business, so\nregular touch-points are made to ensure that our assignees remain engaged and\nconnected during their assignments.\n\n> ##### We want our talent to be excited about returning home, to contribute\n> to the growth of the business and to create the best practices.\n\nLooking ahead, she stresses the importance that mobility is not just used as a\nmeans to fill current resource needs, but also as an enabler to develop and\ngrow future leaders.\n\n### Leveraging a mobile workforce at TDCX\n\nAcross the seas at TDCX (formerly Teledirect Telecommerce), a provider of\nbusiness process services, about 46% of the workforce (comprising 18\nnationalities) is mobilised from other locations to Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe company typically mobilises about 800 employees in a year. Further, as\npart of its mobility policy, it has in place an \"integrated and robust\nonboarding programme\" for mobility employees, **Lim Chee Gay, Chief Human\nResources Officer** _(pictured above, centre)_ , says. The company also has\nMalaysian employees being seconded to other locations.\n\nThis policy is built on the foundation of meeting client requirements,\nsupporting the business needs, and accelerating the employee development plan.\nIn ensuring a smooth assignment, Lim says: \"We have an expatriate assistance\nprogramme, including the comprehensive expatriate handbook, and regular\ndialogue with employees.\"\n\nFurther, although the team does face the common challenges of work permit\nissues, the taxation process, and contract agreements, Lim says: \"Given the\nvolume of our mobility, we have a dedicated team and processes, including\nbest-known practices to support the smooth transition, and assignments. We\nalso have a mobility net promoter score for us to gauge our services and our\nprocesses towards expatriate onboarding.\"\n\nIn the coming year, he expects to focus on the safety of TDCX's expatriates,\nespecially during their assignments through the travel and safety programme.\n\n> ##### We will also continue with our diversity and inclusion initiatives to\n> ensure our expatriates are able to assimilate well into the location\u2019s\n> culture and values.\n\n\"Due to our growth and expansion in 2020, we will continue to source for\naccommodation for our expatriates' relocations and also build a much better\nintegrated assistance programme for our assignees.\"\n\n* * *\n\n### Personal take: Dyson's Shazy Tan\n\nIn this short interview, **Shazy Tan, Global Mobility Manager at Dyson** ,\nshares her personal viewpoints on the challenges faced by mobility\nprofessionals such as herself, how tightening regulations are affecting\nmobility practices, and more.\n\n### **Q What are the typical challenges faced by mobility professionals like\nyourself today?**\n\nThe biggest challenge, which is also the most exciting part of our role, is\nkeeping up with a mobile workforce. With the world becoming more accessible\nand work location lines being more blurred, mobility leaders need to\nunderstand the complexities of immigration and tax (employee and corporate).\n\nThe demographics of people moving have also evolved and there is a need for\nmobility to grow together with the population in order to support them as best\nas we can.\n\nFor example, real-time information for their relocation is an increasing\ndemand by employees which mobility teams are working to provide. Similarly,\nhaving social/political/news updates via social media, which is usually faster\nthan the traditional communication channels of the past (cable TV), is another\nrequest for their relocation experience.\n\n### **Q How are the tightening statutory regulations affecting mobility\npractices?**\n\nProtectionist measures by governments are more apparent today than a few years\nago. This increase in immigration scrutiny can pose challenges to bring\ncertain talent to host locations as they may not meet the minimum requirements\nfor a work visa application. Business travellers who are on extended trips are\nalso being closely monitored as there is a tax impact on their travel which\nmay be missed out by the company.\n\nAll in all, I would take this positively as it pushes mobility and HR leaders\nto improve our candidate selection process and to focus on the quality of the\ntalent we are introducing globally.\n\nThere has always been an issue about how expensive international assignments\nare, yet it can be a struggle for HR to convince the business to hire on local\nterms/local nationals due to business pressure/convenient hire.\n\nDue to tightening statutory regulations, this adds a more serious tone to\nconversations with the business which also drives improvements to HR people\nstrategies.\n\n### **Q Is there a big development that you forecast in the mobility space for\n2020? Please elaborate.**\n\n> ##### What is lacking is a 'Facebook' for foreign employees in a host\n> location where information can be shared and moral support can be provided\n> peer-to-peer to others who are in similar situations as themselves.\n\nThis could potentially be a platform that relocation management companies\n(RMC) can build on their current relocation mobile apps.\n\nMany of the frustrations or anxiety in relocation comes from feeling isolated\nfrom the support/normalities of daily life in the home country. Therefore,\nhaving help or tips from fellow assignees can build that social network and\nreduce the time needed to assimilate in the new location.\n\nThe information or settling-in assistance from RMC or destination service\nproviders (DSP) can sometimes be geared towards information that is not as\nrelevant, given that these programmes are run by local DSP/field consultants\nor consultants who have been in host locations for quite a while.\n\nThe background/age/culture of the consultants will affect the orientation\nexperience as well. Having a platform that enables foreign transfer employees\nto connect and obtain the information that is most relevant to them could be a\nsolution.\n\n* * *\n\n### Handy tips for choosing the best expat accommodation\n\n**Minna Rouru, Area HR Director, Asia Pacific, KONE**\n\nInternational assignees (or expats) and business travellers have a different\nset of requirements. For international assignees, family size, workplace and\nschool locations are key factors in considering the accommodation type, needs\nand budget.\n\nKONE provides a comfortable level of housing depending on the traditions of\nthe host location, availability, and cost of suitable accommodation.\n\nWhen we look at temporary housing, changing situations and the needs of our\ninternational assignees, flexible renting terms are important. In the case of\nlong-term business travellers, the equipment provided, pricing, location and\nancillary services have greater importance.\n\n**Lim Chee Gay, Chief Human Resources Officer, TDCX**\n\nOur criteria for corporate accommodation includes location, safety, pricing,\nfacilities, as well as reviews and feedback.\n\n* * *\n\n_Photos / provided (From L-R: Vicki Ng, Lim Chee Gay,

20191.13k Views\n\nSiliconrepublic.com spoke to Eric Sydell of Shaker International to get a\nbetter understanding of the role AI will play in recruitment in the future.\n\n[![Future of Work Week](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/fow-\nweek.png)](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/series/future-of-work-week)\n\nMost of us are familiar with how applying for a job typically goes. Candidates\ncomplete successive steps, based on a traditional model with applicant\ntracking systems.\n\nMany of us also know from experience that it can be a slow and painful process\n\u2013 one that\u2019s difficult to receive feedback from and that often doesn\u2019t offer\nmuch meaningful insight into the job or the employer.\n\nBut how can we embrace technology to transform the recruitment process in the\nfuture? Siliconrepublic.com spoke to executive vice-president of innovation at\nShaker International, [Eric\nSydell](https://www.shakerinternational.com/member/eric-j-sydell-phd/), to\nfind out.\n\nAccording to Sydell, some companies are getting better, through being less\nreliant on outdated programmes and investing in new ways to enable\npersonalisation and clear communication.\n\n[![](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Careers-in-\narticle-graphics-03.png)](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/employers)\n\n## Embracing AI\n\nAs one of the founders of a\n[company](https://www.shakerinternational.com/about/) providing predictive\ntalent intelligence to improve industry recruitment methods, Sydell is by no\nmeans a newcomer to the field. The secret, he said, resides in the sharper\ntreatment of relevant information.\n\n\u201cArtificial intelligence [AI] and related technologies are now able to analyse\ndata much more thoroughly and powerfully than the statistical techniques of\nthose from only a few years ago.\n\n\u201cBy doing this, there\u2019s potential to better understand a person\u2019s true nature\n\u2013 not just what they typed on a resume or how they answered a simple multiple-\nchoice question,\u201d he said.\n\nOne example of a company putting these ideas into practice is [Singapore\nstart-up Impress](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/impress-ai-chatbot-\nrecruitment-future-work), which has developed a recruiter chatbot designed for\nthe preliminary stages of the interview process.\n\n## Challenges in integration\n\n## Hiring Now\n\n  * [ ![Life at Verizon Media](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Verizon-Media-logo.png)\n\nInforming, entertaining and connecting the world\n\n](https://www.verizonmedia.com/careers/)\n\n  * [ ![Life at Dropbox](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Dropbox_CMYK-small.png)\n\nHelping people and teams focus on the work that matters\n\n](https://www.dropbox.com/jobs)\n\n  * [ ![Life at Workhuman](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/WH-Logo_charcoal-gold_RGB_1101px.png)\n\nMake work more human\n\n](https://www.workhuman.com/company/careers/)\n\n  * [ ![Life at Fidelity Investments](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Fidelity-logo-Featured-Employers.png)\n\nBe part of a globally successful team\n\n](https://www.fidelityinvestments.ie/page/show/careers)\n\nAI technology will drive real change in hiring processes around the world, but\nwe must be cognisant of a common pitfall, Sydell warned.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge with AI in recruiting is \u2013 as with all powerful tools \u2013\nthat it can be misapplied. Companies must be extremely diligent to use it\ncarefully, and many AI start-ups are ill-equipped to see the bigger picture of\nwhen AI should be used versus when it shouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt is nearly impossible to ensure the tool is working correctly and not\nhaving unintended consequences \u2013 such as hiring people who are good problem\nsolvers but tend to be more of one race than another.\n\n\u201cAnother large challenge is that much of this technology is so advanced that\nthe rules and regulations that govern it are hopelessly behind.\u201d\n\n## The future of recruitment\n\nThe current hiring model is frustratingly one-sided, without many benefits for\njobseekers along the way. This poses a significant problem, Sydell noted, as\npositive hiring experiences are crucial in recruitment.\n\nMutually beneficial hiring processes are the way to go, he said. Incorporating\ntwo-way conversations between employers and candidates will help both parties\ndetermine whether or not it\u2019s the right fit.\n\n\u201cIn an ideal world, companies will be able to match candidates with employment\nopportunities in a way that is mutually beneficial.\n\n\u201cOn top of this, assessments, interviews and other tools will be integrated in\na way such that they are not discrete steps, but a seamless flow that\neliminates redundant information collection. Candidates should also receive\nfeedback that helps them grow and learn about themselves.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, AI will ensure that the scores that come out of the hiring\nprocess are both maximally predictive of outcomes that matter to employers and\nalso free from all types of bias,\u201d he added.\n\nClearly, we still have a long journey ahead of us when it comes to harnessing\ntechnological advances to streamline the recruitment process. But, as Sydell\nnoted, there are many interesting opportunities ahead.\n\n[__Tweet](http://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconrepublic.com%2Fadvice%2Ffuture-\nrecruitment-tech-\nai&text=The+future+of+recruitment+and+why+AI+will+be+pivotal+in+making+new+hires&via=siliconrepublic)\n[__](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/advice/future-\nrecruitment-tech-\nai)[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=287597001601476&display=popup&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconrepublic.com%2Fadvice%2Ffuture-\nrecruitment-tech-\nai&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconrepublic.com%2Fadvice%2Ffuture-\nrecruitment-tech-ai) [__Email](mailto:?subject=The future of recruitment and\nwhy AI will be pivotal in making new\nhires&body=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/advice/future-recruitment-tech-ai)\n[__Share](whatsapp://send?text=The%20future%20of%20recruitment%20and%20why%20AI%20will%20be%20pivotal%20in%20making%20new%20hires%20-%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.siliconrepublic.com%2Fadvice%2Ffuture-\nrecruitment-tech-ai) [More]()\n\n[__Share](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/advice/future-\nrecruitment-tech-ai) [__Pin\nThis](javascript:void\\(\\(function\\(\\)%7Bvar%20e=document.createElement\\('script'\\);e.setAttribute\\('type','text/javascript'\\);e.setAttribute\\('charset','UTF-8'\\);e.setAttribute\\('src','//assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r='+Math.random\\(\\)*99999999\\);document.body.appendChild\\(e\\)%7D\\)\\(\\)\\);)\n[__Reddit](http://reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/advice/future-\nrecruitment-tech-ai&title=The future of recruitment and why AI will be pivotal\nin making new hires)\n\nIn-Depth: [Future of Work Week](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/series/future-\nof-work-week)\n\nRelated: [skills](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/skills),\n[recruitment](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/recruitment),\n[AI](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/ai),\n[technology](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/technology),\n[HR](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/topics/hr)\n\n[![](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2015/05/lisa-1.jpg)](https://www.siliconrepublic.com/author/lisa-\nardill)\n\n[__](https://twitter.com/ElseeArdill)\n\n[__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-ardill-75770599/)\n\nBy Lisa Ardill\n\nLisa joined the team as senior Careers reporter in July 2019 with previous\nexperience in science communication and media.

Here are some reasons why freelancers\nshould be part of your recruitment strategy.\n\nBy: [Daniel Teo](https://hrmasia.com/author/daniel/ \"Posts by Daniel Teo\") |\nMarch 3, 2020\n\nTopics: [Asia-Pacific](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/apac/) | [Employee\nExperience](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/employee-experience/) |\n[Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) | [HRM\nFive](https://hrmasia.com/category/regular-features/hrmfive/) |\n[Mobility](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/mobility/) |\n[News](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/news/) |\n[Recruitment](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/recruitment/) | [Talent\nManagement](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/talentmanagement/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/112963390_m.jpg)\n\nThe world of work is changing. The modern workforce\u2019s need for more\nflexibility and businesses becoming more project-focused has given rise to the\ngig economy and freelancers.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why full-time workers are a declining breed while\nfreelancers are the future of the workforce. Having said that, there are\ncompanies that have their reservations about hiring freelancers.\n\nThe common concerns they have are communication, supervision, and payroll. And\nlet\u2019s face it, not every business is suitable for the gig economy and\nfreelancers.\n\nBut the advantages of hiring freelancers will more than compensate for its\nshortcomings. And the rise of online recruitment platforms such as Workana,\nwhich helps to match freelance talent to businesses, has made it easier for\nemployers to transit into the freelance workforce.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at five reasons why freelancers should be part of your\nrecruitment strategy:\n\n**1) Speed**\n\nThis is the age of technology and start-ups. And for start-ups, it\u2019s all about\nspeed. The traditional hiring process from searching, interviewing, offering\nand notice period takes at least three to four months. But you can hire a\nfreelancer in a matter of 36 hours.\n\n\u201cMany of our clients are startups because they need to move very quickly. They\ndon\u2019t have much machinery and money. What they have is speed. When you hire a\nfull-time position it usually takes three to four months to get that position\nfilled from the search to the notice period. At Workana, the average time for\nsomeone to start is 36 hours,\u201d said Tomas O'Farrell, Co-Founder at Workana.\n\n**2) Access to global talent**\n\nWhy hire people within your country when you can find the best talent around\nthe world? One of the drawbacks of having full-time staff is the need for them\nto be physically in the office \u2013 even if their job can be done from anywhere\nin the world. That will severely restrict and shrink the pool of talent you\ncan choose from. Hiring a freelancer online will give you access to a global\ntalent pool which you normally would not have the chance to work with.\n\n**3) Specialised skillset**\n\nFreelancers usually specialise in specific skills such as coding, programming,\ndesigning or writing \u2013 just to name a few. So what you get are experts in\ntheir own fields who cater to your specific business needs or projects. And\nhiring freelancers allows you to compare their portfolios and works before\ndeciding on the best talent. Who knows, you might even hire him or her on a\nfull-time basis if you like their work.\n\n**4) Cost effective**\n\nOne of the main advantages of hiring freelances is its cost effectiveness. The\ncost of hiring full-time staff \u2013 from recruitment, onboarding, training,\nequipment and even insurance \u2013 can take a heavy toll on smaller companies who\ndo not have a huge cash flow. Moreover, having more remote workers means you\ndo not need as much space, thus reducing rental cost.\n\n**5) Promotes diversity and inclusion**\n\nAs businesses today are working towards a more diverse and inclusive\nworkforce, there are still challenges such as culture, biasness and pre-\njudgement. And one of the benefits of hiring a freelancer is that you get a\ndiverse pool of talent with different nationalities, backgrounds and races. It\nalso helps employers to truly focus on merit and ability instead of being\nswayed by external factors such as appearance, speech and body language.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fhrm-5-why-\nyou-should-hire-freelancers%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=HRM+5%3A+Why+you+should+hire+freelancers&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fhrm-5-why-\nyou-should-hire-freelancers%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fhrm-5-why-\nyou-should-hire-freelancers%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Project aims to tackle gender/ethnic bias in AI recruitment\n\n# Project aims to tackle gender/ethnic bias in AI recruitment\n\n29 January 2020\n\n![](https://www.recruiter.co.uk/sites/default/files/web_ai_gender_istock-1159996506.png)\n\nResearchers have set their sights on tackling the problem of gender and ethnic\nbias in recruitment and human resource management as part of a new \u00a31m\nproject.\n\nThe BIAS \u2013 Responsible AI for Labour Market Equality project will explore how\nArtificial Intelligence can lead to unintentional bias in the processes of job\nadvertising, hiring and professional networking, which are increasingly\ndigitalised.\n\nLancaster University will lead the three-year project, working alongside Essex\nUniversity and the University of Alberta. Funding of \u00a3987k comes from the UK\nResearch and Innovation/Economic and Social Research Council (UKRI/ESRC); the\nCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); the Natural Sciences and\nEngineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); and the Social Sciences and\nHumanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).\n\nResearchers will work with industrial partners to understand gender and ethnic\nbias within HR processes, such as hiring and professional networking,\nanalysing data from across hiring and recruitment platforms and developing new\ntools and protocols to mitigate and address such bias. The aim is to enable\ncompanies, HR departments and recruitment agencies to tackle bias issues in\nfuture recruitment.  \n  \nProfessor Monideepa Tarafdar, professor of information systems and co-director\nof the Centre for Technological Futures at Lancaster University Management\nSchool, will lead the research project as principal investigator, working with\nLancaster colleagues Dr Yang Hu, from Sociology, and Dr Bran Knowles, from the\nSchool of Computing and Communications.\n\nThe research ties in with the UK\u2019s Industrial Strategy of \u2018putting the UK at\nthe forefront of the AI and data revolution\u2019 as one of its main challenges, as\nwell as the UK\u2019s AI sector deal that aims to \u2018boost the UK\u2019s global position\nas a leader in developing AI technologies\u2019. It also links with the Canadian\nSSHRC\u2019s goal of tackling persistent ethnic and gender disparities in workforce\nselection and development.\n\nThe project will also look to develop a protocol for responsible and\ntrustworthy AI that reduces labour market inequalities by tackling gender and\nethnic/racial biases in job advertising, hiring and professional networking\nprocesses.\n\n_**\u2022 Comment below on this story.

teams with quality hires.\nIn order to keep the foundation of your organization strong with a high-impact\nworkforce, it is time to move on from manual recruitment and job posting to\nsocial recruiting and recruitment automation.**_\n\nHiring processes take an average of 23 days, but it can feel like months of\nmisery when bogged down with mounds of resumes and tedious tasks. [Over\nhalf](https://www.westmonroepartners.com/Insights/Newsletters/Productivity-\nImperative) of HR managers spend more than three hours a day performing\nadministrative duties, leaving them pressed for time and pressured to make a\nhiring decision they may later regret.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nIn the new age of automation, recruiters can take a breath of fresh air.\n[Recruitment automation](https://kissflow.com/hr-process/power-of-recruitment-\nautomation/) streamlines each step along the hiring process, empowering\nrecruiters with increased control and tracking capabilities while impressing\ncandidates with timely communication and up-to-date technology. If you're\nready to simultaneously lighten the load of paperwork and raise the prospects\nof finding top talent who will stick around, it's time to consider automation\nfor HR hiring processes.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is recruitment? Definition, process, techniques and\nmethods with examples for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-\nrecruitment/)**\n\nHere are several ways you can bake automation into your current processes.\n\n## New hire requests\n\nIf important details are left out of a job posting, candidates and job duties\nend up misaligned, and top candidates slip through the cracks.\n\nA standardized template in a new hire request app ensures no information is\nomitted in the job description. Line managers and HR staff collaborate in the\nworkflow, rather than through strings of emails, to consolidate mandatory\nqualifications, desired skills, and preferred experience for the job.\nNotifications on laptops or mobile devices drive prompt feedback and approvals\nto get job advertisements out ASAP.\n\n## Sourcing candidates\n\nProviding applicants with an attractive, professional hiring experience from\nday one keeps candidates on board rather than turning them off with a slow,\nunappealing process.\n\nUtilizing social media HR tools is imperative to connect with a large pool of\nhighly skilled workers. According to the Society for Human Resource\nManagement, [84 percent](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-\nforecasting/research-and-surveys/Documents/SHRM-Social-Media-Recruiting-\nScreening-2015.pdf) of companies use social media for recruiting, usually to\nfind passive job candidates. An applicant tracking app can post a job\ndescription on multiple sites from one location to simplify publication.\n\n## Screening applicants\n\nManually keeping up with all the applicants in spreadsheets is painstaking,\nbut an applicant tracking system can immediately process applications, rapidly\nsorting through copious amounts of data thanks to the integration between\nworkflow software and spreadsheet/database apps. Industry-specific qualifiers\ncan also be added to check credential and qualification compatibility.\n\nAutomated recruitment apps shortlist candidates via keyword management to weed\nout those not meeting minimum requirements. Applicant info is updated in real-\ntime, allowing managers to follow the most recent data. App notifications make\nit possible for line managers to ask questions about applicants and make\napprovals or rejections instantly.\n\n## Interviews\n\nIf creating interview appointment slots involves multiple email exchanges\nbetween HR and department heads, it's time for a new process. A scheduling\nmodule can align the managers' calendars to automatically place candidates in\nopen slots for interview times, setting interviews closer together for a more\naccurate comparison while eliminating the need for annoying email strings.\n\nWriting and sending the same email for every interview invitation further\nprolongs the process. But with a simple click, emails can automatically be\nsent to top candidates with an interview invitation and proposed time,\nincluding information such as details regarding building or parking access.\nAfter the interviews, the automated workflow can initiate background checks\nand reference checks to chosen candidates, ensuring no follow-up steps are\nmissed.\n\n## Offer letters\n\nWhen a candidate is selected, the documents continue to rack up.

The generational aspect helps streamline\nthe incoherence that is innate to recruitment. From 'job analysis' to\n'selection', generational attributes come into play in the process of\nrecruitment. The varied motivations of these generations profoundly affect how\nthey respond to recruitment and retention strategies and selection procedures.\n\n_Recruitment and selection of baby boomers_\n\nBaby boomers fare very well in mentorship, team development, advisory, and\nleadership roles. They display fewer job mobility behaviors, higher\noccurrences of compliance and fewer instances of termination than their\ncounterparts. Resultantly, head hunting a Baby boomer might prove to be very\ndifficult. The bright side to this resistance is that retaining a Baby boomer\nis easier than the newer generations.\n\nSourcing is more effective if done through personal references who could lure\nthem to move, than digital platforms, thus helping to break the barrier of\nimmobility. Perks, prestige, and position highly motivate Baby boomers and\nhighlighting these benefits can help attract them better. Though not born into\ntechnology, baby boomers have shown amazing learning curves when rightly\nintroduced to technology. Online screening tests should have detailed\ninstructions, and preferably, a provision for personalized support in case of\nclarifications would help correctly capture their KSAOs.\n\n_Recruitment and selection of Gen-X_\n\nIn stark contrast to their workaholic predecessors, Gen X barged that work-\nlife balance was a dire necessity. Though power itself is not alluring to\nthem, roles that need them to perform decision making attracts them., The\ncompany\u2019s deep interest in providing work-life balance and an enriched work\nenvironment, if highlighted in the candidate sourcing communication, can play\na crucial role in attracting the Gen X-ers. Career-oriented social networking\nsites can be a great venue to find Gen X-ers since they are known to be the\nlargest growing generation in social media. Quite familiar with the applicant\ntracking system and psychometric tests, they are comfortable with the tech-\nenabled screening mechanisms.\n\n_Recruitment and selection of Gen-Y_\n\nThe Gen Y is known to search for purpose in each of their efforts and once\nfound work aggressively towards it. The Job analysis process needs to dig a\nlayer deeper to find the right reasons to attract a Gen Y-er. The description\nof organizational purpose as a whole and how the job helps to achieve it is\nvery relevant in the candidate sourcing communication for this generation.\nGeneration Y members are also seen to experiment with roles before deciding on\nan ideal career. Providing internship opportunities and part-time projects is\nthe best way to evaluate a Gen Y candidature.\n\n_Recruitment and selection of Gen-Z_\n\nSocial and Environmental sustainability is a crucial value Gen Z-ers search\nfor in organizations since they are themselves highly aware and conscious of\nthese. They are also known as the most inclusive of the generations. Strong\nrecruitment communications denoting the sustainability and inclusivity\nstrategies followed by the company can significantly help in attracting Gen-\nZers. Counter-intuitively, this generation relishes face-to-face\nconversations, which could determine the selection strategy that needs to be\nused. This generation demands flexibility and deep enrichment of their job\nroles and responsibilities.\n\n\u2018Job analysis\u2019, one of the first steps in recruitment, itself needs to be\nintuitive about the generational characteristics while documenting the KSAOs\nto determine the person specification. As the next step, the candidate\nsourcing process should optimize the communication mix - namely, the content\nand the channels - based on the target generation. Psychometric tests and\nscreening processes need to be sensitive to these generational differences to\nbe effective.\n\n**References:**\n\n  * _Becton JB, Walker HJ, Jones-Farmer A.,

The power in recruiting, which has historically rested with\nemployers, has now shifted to the candidates. Chalk it up to a tight labor\nmarket or the rapid pace of disruption, but there is little doubt that great\nrecruitment is largely an experience-driven process today._**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n## Table of Contents:\n\n  * **What is Candidate Experience?**\n  * **Candidate Experience: The 7 Key Components**\n  * **5 Candidate Experience Strategies for Improvement**\n\n##  \nWhat is Candidate Experience?\n\nCandidate experience is defined as the perception of a job seeker about an\nemployer, based on the interaction during the complete\n**[recruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-full-cycle-recruitment/)** process. This includes all\npoints of contact during recruitment \u2013 job search, the application process,\ninterview process and onboarding.\n\nIn other words, any candidate experience improvement strategy involves\nevaluating every single touchpoint through which a candidate comes into\ncontact with a prospective employer during the recruitment process and their\nfeelings about the same. This may include something as simple as a phone call\nwith the recruiter to more complex concepts like the user-experience on the\ncareers page of the company website.\n\nCandidate experience begins long before a candidate applies for a job.\nAccording to an IBM survey, 48% of the recent candidates surveyed, had\nprevious interactions or relationships with the hiring organization before\nthey applied for a job. These interactions and relationships included having\nfriends or family working there, general awareness around the organization\u2019s\nbrand and reputation, being a customer and having worked with the organization\nbefore. Unsurprisingly, only 2% of the candidates had a negative impression of\nan organization before they applied for a job.\n\nThankfully, as recruiting becomes more digital, HR leaders have the\nopportunity to leverage recruiting technology solutions and tools to design a\nconsistent candidate experience. To understand how technology can influence\nthe candidate experience, let\u2019s look at the key components of candidate\nexperience.\n\nProviding a compelling candidate experience is no longer just an option; it is\na business imperative with very real consequences. For example, a poor\ncandidate experience cost Virgin Media over $6 million in lost revenue in a\nsingle year. On the other hand, a positive candidate experience can drive\nbusiness growth. According to IBM, candidates who've had a good experience\nwith a company are more likely to become new customers, whereas bad candidate\nexperiences take a toll on your brand.\n\nSo, before we talk about how you can improve the candidate experience using\nsome key strategies, let\u2019s identify its primary components.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is Talent Management? Definition, Strategy, Process\nand Model](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/)**\n\n## Candidate Experience: The 7 Key Components\n\nCandidate experience follows the recruiting funnel and with increasing\nautomation, you now have more touchpoints with the candidate to influence\ntheir experience.\n\nLet\u2019s start at the very beginning and go through all the key points of\ninteraction:\n\n**1\\. Job Search:** A candidate\u2019s first interactions with your organization\nwill be either through social media, job advertisements or through the careers\npage on your website. Ensuring that your careers page is easy to find will\nsave your candidates time and effort. This is the first step in a positive\ncandidate experience journey.\n\n**2\\. Job Application:** In addition to making open positions more\ndiscoverable, it is also important that your instructions to candidates\nfilling out applications are clear and concise. For candidates who land on\nyour site through job boards, the job description and the application\ninstructions are vital.\n\n**3\\. Communication:** One of the most frustrating things for candidates is\nthe lack of communication from the employer once they have applied for a job.\nAccording to a recent survey by CareerBuilder on how employers could improve\ncandidate experience, nearly a third of the respondents stated they would like\nmore communication during the recruitment process. Candidates would appreciate\na simple text or an email even if they are passed over during initial\nscreening.\n\n**4\\. Feedback:** If a candidate has been shortlisted by an employer, regular\nstatus updates will keep them engaged in your hiring process. It could be an\nautomated message telling them of the next steps or a call by the recruiter\ninforming them of the shortlist. Either way, communication is key during the\nrecruiting process.\n\n**5\\. Interview:** An interview is your best opportunity to really get to know\nyour candidates and evaluate whether they\u2019ll be a good fit for the job. It is\nalso an opportunity for the candidate to get to know the organization a little\nmore. A positive interview experience is vital to convincing candidates to\njoin your organization. Using a structured interview process will help you\nmake decisions clearly and avoid confusion. Repetitive interviews with\nmultiple people will confuse candidates and add on to the hiring timeline.\nSpeed is of the essence here as candidates are feedback-hungry after the\ninterview process. Inform them of your interview process in advance \u2013 whether\nit\u2019s a video interview or an in-person interview and give them an idea of what\nto expect. After all, for candidates, interviews are the one place where they\nwant to showcase their skills and knowledge.\n\n**6.[Onboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/):** Onboarding is the final\ncandidate experience touchpoint, and what could be a more memorable day for a\ncandidate than their first day? Onboarding is your opportunity to deliver on\nall the promises made during the hiring process. Mountains of paperwork, lack\nof socialization with the team and vague instructions are all indicators of a\nbad candidate experience during onboarding. Following a strategic onboarding\nplan will set up your latest hire for success at your organization from day\none.\n\n**7\\. Analysis:** In order to optimize recruiting efforts and to improve the\ncandidate experience, objectively analyzing, looking into insights and\ntweaking the candidate journey is essential. Analyzing backend **[ATS\n(application tracking\nsystem)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\napplicant-tracking-systems/)** information and candidate behavior data, albeit\ntime-consuming, can be of big help to fine-tuning the hiring funnel.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Candidate\nManagement?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-management-definition-best-practices/)\n\n## 5 Candidate Experience Strategies for Improvement\n\nNow that we\u2019ve established the key components of candidate experience, the\nnext key question is - How can you improve this experience?\n\nHere are the key strategies you can start employing to improve candidate\nexperience:\n\n**1\\. Applicant Tracking Systems:** Applicant tracking systems or ATS are\ncrucial to streamlining and speeding up your recruitment process. Most ATS\nsolutions offer career site integrations and make it easier for candidates to\napply for jobs from either social media, job boards or through career web\npages. An effective ATS also offers a seamless mobile interface that helps\ncandidates complete their application from their mobile devices.\n\n**2\\. Candidate Relationship Management Systems:**[Candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/) systems (CRMs) automate\ncommunication with the candidate after they have applied for the job. Mature\nCRM solutions integrate seamlessly with ATS and help you build active and\npassive talent pools which keep candidates engaged. Additionally, CRMs also\nenable you to send personalized communication at scale to guide candidates\nthrough your recruiting process.\n\n**3\\. Interview Tools:** While in-person interviews are still relevant,\noffering a video interviewing option lets candidates know that you value\nflexibility. Video interview management tools allow you to share an inside\nview of your organization\u2019s culture to the candidate and they also reduce the\ntime spent on phone calls. Video interviewing also makes the hiring process\nmore objective and data-driven, considering it\u2019s the same set of questions\nevery candidate is asked. With technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nand Machine Learning (ML) becoming more common across video interviewing\nplatforms, you can now also evaluate if a candidate would be a good culture-\nfit for your organization.\n\n**Learn More:[Top 10 Recruitment Software and Tools for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nrecruitment-software-technology/)**\n\n**4\\. Onboarding Strategies:** The candidate experience does not stop at\nconducting the perfect interview. Through the processes of selection and\nonboarding, the individual is still a candidate (albeit selected or\nshortlisted) and not an employee _per se_. The ease with which background\nchecks are conducted, the promptness in feedback and turning out the offer and\nthe convenience of joining formalities, all contribute to the candidate\u2019s\nperception of the organization in the final leg of the recruitment journey.\nSmooth [onboarding\nprocesses](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) that do not bury the candidate in\na pile of paperwork and actually allow them a glimpse of life at work, make a\nbig difference.\n\n**5\\. Induction Mechanisms:** Once onboarded, the candidate is finally an\nemployee. That said, the shift from being an employee on paper to actually\nbecoming a productive, well-adjusted employee takes a few months and that is\nwhere the processes of induction and orientation come into play. These\nprocesses could either validate the candidate\u2019s decision to join the\norganization or make them feel that they have made a blunderous mistake in\nchoosing the company over others. This is the window for the organization to\nmake the new recruit feel welcome, motivated and to show them that their\ncandidate experience was simply a precursor to a meaningful employee\nexperience.\n\nDelivering a great candidate experience does not have to be complicated or\nexpensive. Just evaluate your current recruitment practices, identify where\ncandidates drop out and improve your strategy to plug these gaps in delivering\na great experience.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **The Top Corporate Recruitment\nStrategies**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-3-innovative-corporate-recruitment-strategies-for-2019/)\n\n_How are you redefining your candidate experience strategy?

Many organizations now are leveraging AI to improve the efficiency of\ntheir employee engagement, recruitment, performance management, workforce\nmanagement, succession planning processes, and other processes as well. AI is\nparticularly well-suited for these roles, and it helps HR professionals to\nfocus on complex issues, and leave mundane tasks to be performed by\ntechnology.\n\nAlthough there are many potential use cases of AI, organizations are\napproaching it with caution and taking one step at a time. A survey conducted\nby Gartner indicates that 23 percent of organizations who were using some form\nof AI were doing so in the HR and recruiting domain. Other successful\nimplementations of AI focus on intelligent automation for increased efficiency\nand assisting users of HR systems or platforms. For organizations looking to\nuse AI in their HR, here are some trends that can be useful in understanding\nhow to deploy such intelligent technologies to improve existing hiring\nprocesses:\n\n**Talent acquisition:** Automation of processes on multiple fronts is a real\ngame-changer in active recruitment. These can be end-to-end, right from\nwriting the perfect job description (JD) for an open position to even\nconducting video-based interviews. A poorly-constructed JD that is not\nattractive may not get the required interest from the right candidates.\nHowever, there are several tools that can help you draft the perfect JD. These\nare usually of two kinds; an online assistant that can help you improve the JD\nin real-time, while it is being written, or one wherein you can feed an\nexisting JD into a tool that will give you recommendations on how to make the\nJD more effective.\n\n**Resume scouting:** Traditionally the recruiter is the person who sources the\nresume from various sources. This is a time-consuming process, and is also\nprone to human errors. There are many tools available today that can match\nyour job description to resumes on recruitment portals and help you build a\ndatabase of the most relevant candidates. These AI-powered tools use pattern\nmatching algorithms to make sure the resume is a close match to that of the\njob description. They typically use AI and pattern matching algorithms to\nmatch resumes to job descriptions.\n\nFor example, if the recruiter is looking for a marketing professional with 3-5\nyears of experience with a salary of Rs 12, 00,000 per annum who stays within\n10 km of their office, the standard search may throw up 30 candidates.\nHowever, using AI, the software is capable of suggesting that if the\nexperience desired is increased to 6 years and the salary to Rs 15, 00,000,\nthere would be 50 candidates ideal for the profile. This data is useful to\nrecruiters who need to understand where to get the maximum best-suited\ncandidates from. This results in the elimination of manual efforts and a\nsignificant reduction in the number of unsuitable candidates, thus improving\nthe process.\n\n**Video-based interviews:** Certain HR-tech solution companies have also come\nup with video-based interviewing, wherein in-built facial recognition AI\ntechnology is used. The software analyzes the facial expressions and reaction\nof the candidate and then gives a report such as whether the candidate was\ngetting prompted by someone else or the candidate appeared to be telling the\ntruth, etc. Such tools also gauge other features like communication skills,\nbody language, and confidence, thus, helping the recruiter make an informed\ndecision.\n\n**Multifunctional chatbots:** Chatbots are increasingly being utilized for\nvarious HR operations ranging from talent acquisition to guaranteeing employee\nsatisfaction. In terms of the recruitment process, these bots not only address\nbasic queries that a potential employee might have, but also collect standard\ninformation from candidates about their skills and competencies. Some of them\ncan even carry out primary interviews of candidates and evaluate them based on\nspecific keywords. This is particularly advantageous as it not just saves time\nbut also lets HR professionals conduct the further rounds of interview with\nbetter nuanced information about the candidate.\n\nToday, chatbots even conduct interactive employee training sessions, outputs\nof which have been noticed to be far more interesting than traditional\ntraining methods. They can also disburse information regarding detailed\ncompany processes, particularly to newer recruits, provide new employees with\nperformance-based feedback instantly, thereby ensuring higher employee\nsatisfaction.\n\n**Predictive analytics:** While most HR workspaces conventionally collect\nlarge amounts of data, the truth is that it is not utilized to its full\npotential. AI is adept at swiftly analyzing massive amounts of data,\nidentifying patterns and drawing conclusions, much faster and more accurately\nthan manually possible by humans. This can help HR in making recommendations\nbased on predictive analytics, which are highly useful in increasing employee\nretention rates, rolling out the better selection and evaluation processes,\netc.\n\nThe changing needs and demands of the industry have forced organizations to\nadopt these practices and three in five HR leaders believe that if HR\nfunctions are not modernized in time, there exists a danger of becoming\nirrelevant in the sector. Having said that, most HR personnel are still wary\nof AI-related developments primarily because they believe it requires immense\nknowledge and technical skills to equip themselves with the necessary\nexpertise needed to incorporate these applications and practices in their\ndaily functioning. There also exists a fear of this automation, ultimately\nleading to loss of jobs.\n\nHowever, it is important to remember that AI-powered software and applications\ncannot entirely replace the human component in the HR process. If anything,\nthey can improve the overall effectiveness and help the industry move one step\ncloser to what is considered to be the future of HR.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [HR

But\nartificial intelligence got a bad rap last year when news got out that\nAmazon's internal AI recruiting tool had \"learned\" gender bias. So, is AI\nbeneficial to those seeking diversity, or will it just exacerbate the problem?\nOne recruiting firm has found that AI is an effective strategy for increasing\nthe diversity of candidate pools, as long as its implemented correctly.\n\n**The Problems With Using AI In Recruiting**\n\n[Amazon](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-\ninsight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-\nwomen-idUSKCN1MK08G) scrapped its internal AI recruiting efforts after\nrealizing that the test recruiting program they designed was biased against\nwomen. The computer models were trained with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s submitted to Amazon over\nthe previous ten years. Not surprisingly, most of these r\u00e9sum\u00e9s came from men.\nTherefore, the computer models \u201clearned\u201d that men were superior job\ncandidates.\n\nAs a result, the models became biased against women, generating lower ratings\nto graduates of two all-women\u2019s colleges and penalizing r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that contained\nthe word \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d as in \u201cwomen\u2019s chess club captain.\u201d Although the programs\ncould be altered to become neutral to these particular terms, Amazon decided\nto scrap the project out of fear that the models may develop other\ndiscriminatory selection criteria.\n\n**The Benefits Of Using AI In Recruiting**\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\nDespite Amazon's setbacks, Genevieve Jurvetson, cofounder and CMO of the\nartificial intelligence-based recruiting firm, Fetcher, believes AI is an\nessential tool for those seeking a more diverse candidate pool. \u201cIf you get\ntoo caught up in the fears surrounding AI, you miss a huge opportunity,\"\nJurvetson says. She explains that there are innumerable criteria that you can\nuse to find good candidates that are not remotely gender-related. Jurvetson\nclaims that Fetcher's use of AI techniques allows them to bring minorities and\nwomen into their clients' hiring pipeline in a way other recruiting methods\njust can't.\n\nWhy are AI techniques so effective? We all know humans have biases. Take\ngender bias, for example. After a lifetime of exposure to mostly men in\nleadership roles, in boardrooms and in tech jobs, we develop a bias to prefer\nmen in these positions. The big advantage of artificial intelligence is that\nit removes the humans and their biases from a large chunk of the recruiting\nprocess. The more you can remove human intervention, particularly at the\nstages of the recruiting process that are most prone to bias, **** the less\nthat bias will be able to influence decision-making.\n\nAlthough Fetcher allows clients to \u201cthumbs up or thumbs down\u201d potential\ncandidates, Jurvetson thinks the most diverse candidate pools come from what\nthey call their fully automated mode. In this mode, Fetcher hones in on client\npreferences by asking the client to review a handful of candidates. Then,\nFetcher's systems take control, assembling a candidate pool, and contacting\npotential candidates directly. This way, a client's potential biases are ****\nremoved from the process of choosing who will be contacted. Jurvetson\ndescribes, \u201cWhen you pull yourself out of the process, that\u2019s a really\nimportant step because when you\u2019re not hand-selecting each candidate, you\u2019re\nnot bringing in these inherent biases that we all have.\u201d\n\nOne reason that organizations have trouble increasing diversity is that the\ntraditional methods of searching for candidates are often biased. The problem,\nJurvetson explains, is that searches often use bias-ridden proxies for\ncandidate potential. \u201cDid they go to a top 20 university? Did they come from a\ntop-tier company? Those tend to be pools of talent that might not be that\ndiverse to start with. Using AI to be able to identify patterns, career\nprogression is a great one, that correlate with success better than those old\nproxies is exciting and effective,\u201d she explains.\n\nAccording to Jurvetson, searches using these less-traditional proxies for\nsuccess identified by artificial intelligence programs allow Fetcher to find\ncandidates that might otherwise go overlooked. This allows organizations to\ncast a wider net than they might otherwise.\n\nResearch confirms there are huge advantages of casting a wide net when\nassembling a candidate pool if you want to increase diversity. [One\nstudy](https://hbr.org/2016/04/if-theres-only-one-woman-in-your-candidate-\npool-theres-statistically-no-chance-shell-be-hired) found that if you only\nhave one female candidate or underrepresented minority candidate in your pool\nof candidates, they have almost no chance of making it to the offer stage.\nThat's because the lone woman or minority seems too different from the norm.\nHowever, if you add a second female or minority candidate, their odds of\nmaking it to the final round increase dramatically, and they have the same\nchance of receiving an offer as the other candidates.  \n\nWhat keeps the Fetcher models from having the same issue as Amazon\u2019s failed\nmodel? Jurvetson suggests that precautions need to be taken to minimize any\nunintended effects. At Fetcher, she says they keep their models simple, and\nthey keep a trained human eye on the models and the outputs to be sure the\nrecruiting criteria are gender-neutral and that the models are returning\ndiverse candidate pools.\n\n**The Future Of AI In Recruiting**\n\nRecently, Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic and Reece Akhtar made an argument in\n[Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2019/05/should-companies-use-ai-to-\nassess-job-candidates) for taking the use of AI techniques one step further\nand applying them to the interview process. The researchers report, \u201cOne of\nthe major problems with the way we currently interview job candidates is that\nthe process is largely unstructured, leaving the questioning to the whims and\nfancies of the interviewer. It shouldn\u2019t take much convincing to see how this\nis not only inefficient, but how it also leads to [biased decision-\nmaking](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-6570.2010.01172.x)\ndue to interviewers expressing and seeking to confirm their own preferences.\nThis is where video or digital interviews are likely to help. Digital\ninterviews can remove these limitations almost entirely.\u201d\n\nWhile optimistic at about their potential, Jurvetson doesn't think AI job\ninterviews will take over any time soon. \"I think if used thougthtfully, they\ncan be really powerful and helpful for a lot of candidates, especially at\nearly stages of the recruiting process, but I don\u2019t have to tell you all the\nways that can go wrong as well. You have to be smart about how and when you\nutilize these types of interviews, or racial or gender issues could come into\nplay in a really sad way, and you could also negatively impact the candidate\nexperience,\" she reports. One more limitation she added, \u201cI\u2019ve heard from\ncandidates interviewing for more experienced roles that they sometimes find\n[automated interviews] insulting, because they can give the impression that\nthe potential employer isn't willing to give you their time.\u201d\n\nFor those looking to create a more diverse workforce, removing human decision-\nmaking from at least a part of the recruiting process seems like a no-brainer\nfor reducing unconscious bias in hiring. Implemented correctly, AI tools can\nbe a great way to search in an unbiased manner. And for those job seekers of\nthe future, keep an open mind about a robot interviewer\u2014hopefully it will be\nprogrammed to be less biased than a human manager.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@kimelsesser) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-elsesser-4745572b/).

I\u2019ve taught courses on gender for eight years\nat UCLA, have published in the New York Times and Los Angeles Times and have\ndiscussed gender issues on Fox News, NPR and BBC. My book, Sex and the Office\nalso dives in to some of the obstacles holding women back. My unique\nperspective comes from my varied background. I hold a Ph.D. in Psychology from\nUCLA and two graduate degrees (management and operations research) from the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and an undergrad degree in\nmathematics and computer science from Vassar College.\n\n Read Less\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Kim Elsesser&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: Is Artificial Intelligence The Key To Recruiting A Diverse Workforce? %0A Author: Kim Elsesser %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2019/08/13/is-artificial-intelligence-the-key-to-recruiting-a-diverse-workforce/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

He added that understanding\nhow to source from diverse talent pools, trying to prevent bias in the\nassessment and hiring process, and evaluating workplace culture for inclusion\nare major steps employers can take to increase diversity.\n\nMore practitioners are realizing that hiring for diversity is not enough.\nEmployers risk employee disengagement and attrition if diverse hires don't\nfeel included and accepted.\n\n\"It doesn't matter that you hired more women or more of whatever it is you\nneeded to look like a United Colors of Benetton ad,\" said Tim Sackett, SHRM-\nSCP, a recruiting industry thought leader and the president of HRU Technical\nResources, an IT and engineering staffing firm in Lansing, Mich. \"If those you\nhired don't feel like a part of the organization, you'll never keep them\nanyway.\"\n\nThis level of diversity is really hard, Sackett added. Practicing inclusion\ntakes an entire overhaul of a company's culture and ongoing maintenance. \"It's\nactually easy to check boxes and get to a point where you'll look politically\ncorrect as it relates to the diversity of your employees. It's super hard to\nget to a point where people feel like they truly belong.\"\n\n[HR needs to take a hard look at the organizational\nculture](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/build-\ninclusive-culture-recruiting-diversity.aspx) to make sure that differing\nopinions are respected and people are encouraged to be themselves.\n\nModifying Interviewing, Selection\n\nTraditional interviewing is costly and takes too long, and typical selection\ncriteria don't result in effective candidate evaluations anyway, according to\nexperts.\n\n\"It's kind of a disaster when you spend 20 hours of company time interviewing\nsomeone,\" Browne said. \"Do candidates really need to meet with 10 or 12\npeople? If you've ever been on an interview and had to come back three or four\nor five times and meet more and more and more people, it's exhausting.\"\n\nInstead, forward-looking companies are exploring [skills\nassessments](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/predictive-\nassessments-insight-candidates-potential.aspx), [job\ntryouts](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/talent-\nauditions-interviewing-practices.aspx) and [hiring for potential instead of\nexperience](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/ditch-\nresumes-hire-for-learning-ability.aspx). LinkedIn found that a majority of\nemployers are interested in using:\n\n  * Online soft skills assessments that measure traits like teamwork and curiosity.  \n\n  * Job auditions, where candidates are paid to do real work while supervisors observe them.   \n\n  * [Informal team interviews with potential co-workers](/ResourcesAndTools/hr-topics/talent-acquisition/pages/team-interviewing-best-practices.aspx), where both sides have a chance to talk about the role and gauge whether there is a fit.  \n\nSelection criteria are also undergoing a refresh. More employers struggling to\nfind perfect candidates will adopt the mantra of hiring for attitude and\ntraining for technical skills, experts believe. \"Not being 100-percent\nqualified is no longer a deal-breaker,\" said Matt Ferguson, CEO of talent\nacquisition solutions company CareerBuilder. He referenced a recent\nCareerBuilder survey that showed 66 percent of organizations plan to train new\nworkers who may not have all the required skills but show potential to excel.\n\n\"While hard skills reign in sectors like technology and health care, less-\nteachable soft skills will continue to be critically important\u2014even in a more\ntechnology-driven work environment,\" said Alan Stukalsky, chief digital\nofficer for Randstad North America, the U.S. division of the global staffing\nand HR services provider. \"Employers will increasingly focus on training new\nhires, especially when they find the culture fit they are looking for or\nsuperb soft skills.\"\n\nThat's exactly what Maren Hogan, CEO of Red Branch Media, an Omaha, Neb.-based\nB2B marketing firm for HR technology, does. \"When I hire people, I'm not\nhiring a job description,\" she said. \"When I'm looking to add another employee\nto my team, I'm looking at their attitude, how they approach communication\nwith me, what it is that moves them and how they work best. Do they value\nlearning and skill development?\"\n\nIn addition to prehire assessments and informal group evaluations, Hogan\nrecommended mapping out the type of personality you want in the role.\n\"Considering what traits will provide value to your organization will give you\na candidate persona that can lead everything\u2014from where you advertise the job\nto the language used in the ad itself.\"\n\n>  _Was this article useful?

critical, and complex,\n[challenge](https://hrexecutive.com/want-to-know-what-your-peers-are-doing-to-\nstrengthen-talent-acquisition/) of assessing and transforming today's emerging\ntalent-acquisition strategies, employers can use as much help as they can get.\n\nThat being the case, they just may discover some highly useful information in\na [new six-part series](https://www.cielotalent.com/insights/bersin-series-\ntalent-planning-how-to-utilize-market-insights-for-talent-acquisition-\nefficiency/), _Guide to Talent Acquisition for the Future_ , created in\npartnership by Cielo, a strategic recruitment-process outsourcing partner, and\nglobal industry analyst Josh Bersin.\n\nAccording to the authors, this new series combines Bersin's research and\nmarket knowledge, including firsthand input from talent-acquisition leaders,\nwith expertise and insight Cielo has collected via client experiences in a\nvariety of business sectors over the past 15 years. The guide launched Jan. 21\nwith the \u201cTalent Planning: How to Utilize Market Insights for Talent\nAcquisition Efficiency\" installment.\n\n\"In coming years, talent is only going to become scarcer,\" Bersin says. \"This\nmakes strategic talent acquisition critical for short- and long-term business\nsuccess. Companies that approach recruiting reactively, or without taking\nadvantage of the tools and data now available, will be at a distinct\ndisadvantage.\"\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nBersin explains that he and Cielo produced the series because they recognized\nthe need for a comprehensive resource that consolidates talent-acquisition\ninsights and techniques in one place. As such, the guide content can help\nCHROs and other talent leaders develop the future state of their talent-\nacquisition functions.\n\nEach of piece of the series **\u2014** the remaining ones being candidate\ngeneration; assessment and matching; candidate selection and offer;\nonboarding; and reporting and analytics **\u2014** focuses on a different aspect of\nthe recruiting process key to the development and execution of a successful\ntalent-acquisition strategy. They also feature case studies showcasing real-\nworld examples to put into action, according to Sue Marks, CEO and founder of\nCielo.\n\n[**Also see:** How to prepare your recruiting team for\n2020](https://hrexecutive.com/how-to-prepare-your-recruiting-team-for-2020/)\n\n\"In a hyper-competitive market with geopolitical, global economic and\nworkforce dynamics changing quickly, knowledge is critical for success in the\ntalent market today,\" Marks says. \"HR and TA leaders currently face\nunprecedented expectations and demands. This guide will provide inspiration to\nbuild a winning strategy and position their team and themselves for success.\"\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nBersin further explains that the business costs of not using market data in\ntalent planning can be high. In fact, a company can fail to hire the needed\nstaff in a given location due to a local skills shortage. Offers may go\nunaccepted because they\u2019re not competitive.\n\n\u201cDiversity goals may sit unmet for years due to limited talent availability\nand local demographics,\u201d he says. \u201cThe result of \u2018flying blind\u2019 based on\nincorrect assumptions is a talent-acquisition function that fails to achieve\nits potential as a strategic partner in the business.\u201d\n\nHe adds that today\u2019s availability of user-friendly analytic tools, a variety\nof quality data sources and specialized data-analysis skills enable companies\nto uncover deeper insights previously not available. In addition, the\navailability of benchmarking data facilitates more accurate goal setting.\nBersin notes that all this combined gives talent-acquisition leaders the\nability to make truly strategic hiring plans and provide contextualize\nperformance metrics to stakeholders.\n\n\u201cBringing talent planning further into the organization will enable companies\nto make proactive decisions that impact internal mobility and/or learning and\ndevelopment initiatives,\u201d Bersin says.\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

Track. Strategize.**\n\n##  \n**What Is an Applicant Tracking System (ATS)?**\n\nAn applicant tracking system or ATS is a software solution to manage all\nrecruitment needs, serving as a data bank for all hiring processes. As the\nname suggests, ATS enables automated applicant tracking and can store and\nprocess vast volumes of data. With features such as interview scheduling,\nassessment generation, and comparison, message distribution, universal search,\nand customized import and export of data, applicant tracking systems aid in\nscreening, shortlisting, and communicating with candidates.\n\nATS options are available for businesses across the board, be it for\nenterprise, midsize, or small business requirements. Moreover, based on\nspecific business needs, organizations can also choose various formats of\ndeployment.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you need to purchase an ATS solution for a midsize\ncorporation with an employee strength of 800 (spread across three regions) \u2013\nwhich you wish to double over the next year. There was a time when you could\nnot find a customized solution specific to your needs, budget, and growth\nplans. So you would have had to go for a typical one-size-fits-all option.\nNow, however, organizations are spoilt for choice in a market that offers\nmultiple options for the most specific combination of needs.\n\nWhile most **[human capital management\n(HCM)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-human-capital-management/)** suites do offer the sub-functionality\nof an applicant tracking system, there are also several point solutions that\nspecialize only in ATS. The challenge now is not hunting for a specialized,\ncustomizable solution but rather choosing the solution that is the best fit\nout of the many that are available.\n\nThe pie chart below depicts the market share enjoyed by the twenty most\nprevalent ATS software. We will focus on the top10 ATS solutions for 2020 in\nno particular order. Since there is no one-size-fits-all mantra for choosing\nan ATS, there is no \u201ctop\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d solution that would work across the board.\nThe key is to identify your own requirements of an ATS and then choose a\nsolution that can be suited to each unique need of your organization.\n\n![Market share of ATS solutions](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1.

For example, analyzing the right talent gaps for the present and\nthe future, identifying the right talent pools and best-fit candidates,\ngetting them to join and then optimizing their existing skills and strengths\nwhile helping them grow are touch-points that are all equally important. They\nsupport each other and the whole structure would crumble even if one sub-\nprocess fell out of sync.\n\n**Learn more:** [**What Is Talent Acquisition? Definition, Process,\nStrategies, and Best\nPractices**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-acquisition/)\n\n## **Talent Management Process**\n\nWhile often cyclical rather than a generic linear progression of events, the\nprocess of talent management could be considered, to begin with acknowledging\nthe need for talent and leads to filling that gap and ultimately growing and\noptimizing the skills, traits, and expertise of employees, new and old.\n\nThe following image depicts the key points of the talent management process:\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n_**Source: Business Jargons**_\n\nLet\u2019s get into these key steps in the process of managing talent effectively:\n\n**1\\. Planning:** Like in any process with a set outcome, planning is the\nfirst step in the process of talent management. It involves the following\nidentifying where the gaps lie - the human capital requirement, formulating\njob descriptions for the necessary key roles to help guide sourcing and\nselection and developing a workforce plan for recruitment initiatives.\n\n**Learn more:** [**What is Talent Sourcing? Definition, Process, Strategy with\nExamples**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-sourcing/)\n\n**2\\. Attracting:** Based on the plan, the natural next step is to decide\nwhether the talent requirements should be filled in from within the\norganization or from external sources. Either way, the process would involve\nattracting a healthy flow of applicants. The usual external sources include\njob portals, social network, and referrals. The talent pools that need to be\ntapped into must be identified in advance to keep the process as smooth and\nefficient as possible. This is where the kind of employer brand that the\norganization has built for itself, comes into play because that decides the\nquality of applications that come in.\n\n**Learn more:** [**What is Talent Pipeline? Definition, Management with\nExamples**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-pipeline/)\n\n**3\\. Selecting:** This involves using a string of tests and checks to find\nthe right match for the job \u2013 the ideal person-organization fit. Written\ntests, interviews, group discussions and psychometric testing along with an\nin-depth analysis of all available information on the candidate on public\naccess platforms help in gauging an all-rounded picture of the person. Today\nthere are software and AI-enabled solutions that recruiters can use to skim\nthrough a vast population of CVs to focus on the most suitable options and to\nfind the ideal match.\n\n**Learn more:** [**Candidate Screening and Selection Process: The Complete\nGuide for 2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-screening-and-selection/)\n\n**4.** **Developing:** Quite a few organizations today operate on the idea of\nhiring for attitude and training for skills. This makes sense because while\nyou would want a predisposition to certain skill-sets, it is the person that\nyou are hiring and not the CV. Developing employees to help them grow with the\norganization and training them for the expertise needed to contribute to\nbusiness success also builds loyalty and improves employee engagement. This\nbegins with an effective onboarding program to help the employee settle into\nthe new role, followed by providing ample opportunities for enhancing the\nskills, aptitude and proficiency while also enabling growth through\ncounseling, coaching, mentoring and job-rotation schemes.\n\n**Learn more:** [**What Is Onboarding? Definition, Process, Templates, and\nBest Practices**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/)\n\n**5**. **Retaining:** For any organization to be truly successful,\nsustainably, talent needs to be retained effectively. Most organizations try\nto retain their best talent through promotions and increments, offering\nopportunities for growth, encouraging involvement in special projects and\ndecision-making, training for more evolved roles and rewards and recognition\nprograms.\n\n**Learn more:** [**The Importance of Employee Retention - The Key to a\nSuccessful Business**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/the-importance-of-employee-retention-the-key-to-a-successful-\nbusiness/)\n\n**6\\. Transitioning:** Effective talent management focuses on a collective\ntransformation and evolution of the organization through the growth of\nindividual employees. This involves making each employee feel that they are a\npart of a bigger whole. Providing retirement benefits, conducting exit\ninterviews and effective succession planning might seem like unrelated career\npoints but they are all transition tools that enable the shared journey.\n\n## **Talent Management Model**\n\nOver the years, there have been multiple models made for talent management\nthat have been created b organization who have felt that they have finally\ncracked the code on the perfect model. The thing with talent management,\nhowever, is that it needs to morph to suit the latest talent trends, digital\ndisruptions, and employee expectations.\n\nThe following diagram is that of the integrated talent management model which\nappears to be the most relevant one today.\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n_Source: Hudson Research & Consulting_\n\nThe primary components of the model are:\n\n  * Acquire \u2013 Employer branding, recruitment, onboarding\n  * Assess \u2013 Talent analytics, succession planning and assessments\n  * Develop \u2013 Workforce planning, culture at work, engagement and retention practices\n  * Deploy \u2013 Goal alignment, career-path planning, learning and development, and performance management\n\n  \nThis structure of components is cyclical and goes on in a sustained loop while\ntaking onto consideration the internal climate within the organization and the\nexternal environment in which it operates.\n\nHow can an organization ensure that this model is put to the best use? The\nfollowing graphic enumerates the facets that need to be kept in mind.\n\n![primary components of the model ](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n_**Source: Corvirtus**_\n\nThe point to be kept in mind here is that no model of something as dynamic as\ntalent management is writ in stone. It needs to be able to adapt to the\nchanging needs of the organization the evolving talent expectations and the\npace set by changes within the industry.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Talent Acquisition Specialist: 10 Key Skill Requirements\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-specialist-key-skill-requirements/)**\n\n## **Talent Management Strategy**\n\nTalent management is not a mere checklist of requirements that need to be\nsufficed \u2013 it is a strategy that needs careful implementation, regular checks,\nand continual improvement. The following are the six primary talent management\nstrategies that serve as the pillars of people functions.\n\n### **1\\. Detailed job descriptions**\n\n  \nA well-informed, detailed job description helps the sourcer, the sourcing\nsoftware, and the candidate understand the job-role better. Generic job\ndescriptions only serve to confuse all parties involved in the talent\nacquisition process and lead to a wave of irrelevant applications. Information\nthat must be a part of the job description includes the following:\n\n  * Job title and location\n  * Overall duties\n  * Skills required\n  * Reporting lines\n  * Tools and equipment used\n  * Salary and benefits\n\n  \nWith these, candidates can make an informed decision on whether to apply or\nnot and sourcers get CVs that fit the bill better.\n\n**Learn More:** **[How to Become a Smart Recruitment Specialist in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-to-\nbecome-a-smart-recruitment-specialist/)**\n\n### **2\\. Person-organization fit**\n\n  \nAn employee that does not fit into the organizational culture can neither be\nthe happiest employee nor the most sustainably productive one. While the\nculture can be difficult to define in words, it is prevalent in actions and\nquite easy to understand whether a candidate would be a good fit or not.\nPersonal and organizational values need to have a certain degree of overlap\nfor any employee to feel at home within the organization. Without a\ncomfortable person-organization fit, the most amount of time, effort and\nenergy would go into attempts at adjustment. Hiring candidate with the right\nP-O fit (or PE fit) thus greatly improves the chances of better employee\nengagement, higher employee satisfaction, and usually better performance.\n\n### **3\\. Collaborate-coach-evolve**\n\n  \nAn important strategy to make talent management more effective involves\ncreating a culture of coaching, mentoring (even reverse mentoring) and\ncollaboration. Constructive feedback goes a long way when it comes to helping\nemployees evolve and develop their skills and expertise. Managing talent is\nthus also about preparing them for the future of the organization \u2013 to be\nready for changes down the path and to be able to rely on each other.\n\n### **4\\. Reward and recognize right**\n\n  \nThe process of rewards and recognition forms an important part of the strategy\nto motivate, engage and manage employees better. This goes beyond financial\nrewards and bonus packages. Studies point towards the fact that employees\noften want R&R; schemes that motivate them with \u201cprizes\u201d that are most\nrelevant to them as individuals. This is a great opportunity for organizations\nto show their employees how much they care for them as persons and as integral\naspects of the organizational machinery.\n\n### **5.** **Opportunities for continuous improvement**\n\n  \nManaging talent needs to be put in the context of the future that the\norganization has envisioned for itself. Thus, employees need to be equipped\nwith the right tools to be able to maximize their own potential. For the\ncontinuous improvement of the organization, there needs to be the scope and\nopportunities for the continuous development of its employees. Moreover, this\nensures that the cumulative skills within the organization is updated,\nupgraded and upscaled.\n\nTalent management involves strategically planning career paths that make sense\nfor every employee. We all tend to work better we know where we are headed and\nwhat the next stop is for our careers. This does not entail making empty\npromises of promotions but rather creating a career map in discussion with the\nemployee, making sure that they relate to it and feel that it is realistic\nwhile also providing them with all the necessary tools to make the map a\nreality. Having a map to follow also improves retention scores since employees\nthen know what they have to look forward to and work towards and can then\ncollaborate effectively to achieve it.\n\n**_What are the talent management strategies that you employ at work?

management, integrity improves, along with\nstandardization, transparency and ultimately, process design.\n\nBy: [Paul Bartlett](https://hrexecutive.com/author/paul-bartlett/ \"Posts by\nPaul Bartlett\") | February 10, 2020 \u2022 3 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Leadership](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrleadership/) | [HR\nTechnology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hpb/hpb-top-stories/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/07/GettyImagesAutomation700-700x450.jpg)\n\nExecutives around the world are looking for continuous process improvements\nand new ways to enhance organizational effectiveness. It\u2019s an evergreen topic\nand one that deserves ongoing consideration and attention. Markets fluctuate,\ncompetitive pressures necessitate constant change and business goals evolve.\nPerhaps nowhere is this more apparent than within human resources, a critical\ncorporate function constantly challenged with demonstrating its value and\nmeasuring what matters. Factor in global presence and the imperative grows\neven taller, as HR teams seek to orchestrate their activities across time\nzones, language barriers and local labor laws. All the while, payroll tackles\nsimilar challenges, working diligently to satisfy country-specific\nrequirements and ensure employees get paid accurately and on-time. Two\nseemingly separate needs, both handling workforce information day in and day\nout, maintaining and updating records, managing requests, and ultimately,\npromoting a positive employee experience across the board.\n\nDepending on the project, HR and payroll spend an excessive number of hours\ncoordinating data collection and verification, making adjustments,\ncalculations and transferring information as needed. Even organizations in the\nU.S. with enterprise solutions in place, struggle to automate across global\nlocations, relying instead on manual updates and spreadsheets and resulting in\nmore mistakes and higher costs back to the employer. Historically, it seemed\nimpossible to share workflows, and as a result, the HR and payroll landscape\nbecame increasingly fractured and decentralized, unable to bridge the divide \u2013\nuntil recently.\n\n**Revisiting product**\n\nToday, advanced technologies allow for the movement of data around the globe\nthrough automation across the cloud. With the shift towards digital\ntransformation, comes the opportunity to simplify and streamline systems\nthrough integration \u2013 but change happens slowly, as evidenced by last year\u2019s\n[Payroll Operations Survey from\nDeloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/human-\ncapital/articles/payroll-operations-survey.html), which showed only 6% of\ncompanies use robotics as part of their processing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nThere remains an amazing amount of information available that no one ever\nthought to get from the other, and a unified, automated approach between HR\nand payroll makes it possible to review and refresh what already exists while\ngathering anything missing. At the same time, recent regulations, such as\nGDPR, put new guidelines and restrictions in place, reinforcing the need for a\nfresh look. From a data security perspective, integrations enable teams to\nmonitor the access to and movement of data from a single source, as opposed to\nmany. In the case of one multinational financial services company, integration\nand automated workflows reduced reliance on manual interventions, improved\nreporting, and maintained compliance that meets regional standards while\nproviding significant process improvements.\n\nWith a global, unified platform, people and processes work collectively,\nmanaging both the day-to-day and unexpected tasks in real-time. Shared\nworkflows open up collaboration and communication, regardless of location,\nremoving the guesswork for scheduling and using built-in functionality for\nreporting and validations. Once the current workload becomes integrated and\nautomated, incremental activities get built on top of that base, contributing\nto improved efficiency and outcomes.\n\n**Unifying people**\n\nThere is no doubt that technology serves as the core of any integration, in\nthis instance, with the tools and automation embedded on a global basis,\nrather than country by country. But there is another critical factor to\nconsider in achieving these workflows because beyond the immediate\nstakeholders is the impact of HR and payroll have on the employee experience.\nFreeing up the tedium associated with disparate systems, HR and payroll\nprofessionals offload the process-heavy tasks and focus more on meaningful\ninitiatives \u2013 reinvigorating their roles and responsibilities and bringing\ninspiration and innovation to the organization.\n\nFor the multinational mentioned above, integration worked to centralize\npayroll data across jurisdictions, adding authorization and validation online\nwhile eliminating the need for different providers, forms, and documentation.\nAs a result of simplification and automation, the teams introduced online\npayslips and offered employees the opportunity to use self-service tools to\nmaintain personal data.\n\nWithout the stress of each country\u2019s run deadlines and the looming threat of\nerrors, payroll can build out and introduce new options like payroll cash\nadvances to help employees in between paychecks. On the HR side, having access\nto [global payroll](https://www.cloudpay.net/) data boosts visibility across\nthe workforce and supports internal recruitment and talent mobility programs \u2013\nat a time when [PwC sees a 50% increase in international\nassignments](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/managing-tomorrows-people/future-of-\nwork/pdf/talent-mobility-2020.pdf) on the horizon. Through integration, the\ncapabilities of HR and payroll expand, linking the two with employer brand\nmanagement while workers benefit as well, signaling a win-win for the\norganization.\n\n**Harmonizing process**\n\nOf course, as executives know all too well, there is always new and more work\nto do. What serves the organization today may not tomorrow, and HR and payroll\nneed to remain agile. [Deloitte refers to this mindset as\n\u201charmonizing\u201d](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/mergers-\nacqisitions/us-ma-using-integration-to-catalyze-hr-transformation.pdf) rather\nthan the more frequently used \u201coptimizing,\u201d noting that \u201cA transformative\nintegration \u2026 may identify opportunities to more efficiently deliver HR\nservices, including technology-enabled improvements and process redesign.\u201d\nHaving already touched upon improvements to service delivery, the focus shifts\nto process, which underpins the success of the product and the people involved\nwith HR and payroll.\n\nOften, through a series of workflows engines or mapping, metadata about the\nprocess gets captured, indicating where inefficiencies take place and offering\na clear line of sight into potential improvements. An instance of this\nhappening might involve first-time approval rates and the effectiveness of\nmoving HR data into the payroll process. By analyzing the success of the task,\nHR and payroll learn about the accuracy of existing data as well as anything\nmissing that would be required for future runs. No surprise that same\nmultinational now sees a payroll accuracy rate of 99.99% while bringing cost\nsavings across functions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nAs this practice progresses, with HR and payroll updating and automating as\nneeded, the organization gains more profound insights into the overall\nefficiency of its integrations and shared workflows. Through better data\nmanagement, integrity improves, along with standardization, transparency and\nultimately, process design, leading HR and payroll teams to harmonious,\nproductive co-habitation.\n\nThe HR and payroll markets continue to innovate and enhance all aspects of\nworkforce management, and with that, so must global employers. The rapid\nadvancement of automation, integration and workflows correspond directly with\nan organization\u2019s capacity to adapt and adopt quickly in the future. Like the\nemployee experience, digital transformation never stops, and the ability to\nintegrate HR and payroll offers global organizations the chance to evolve with\nworkforce needs in near real-time, positively impacting their product, process\nand people.\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fshaping-\nhr-effectiveness-through-shared-workflows%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Shaping+HR+effectiveness+through+shared+workflows&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fshaping-\nhr-effectiveness-through-shared-workflows%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fshaping-\nhr-effectiveness-through-shared-workflows%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

(Photo by\nIsaac Brekken for Human Resource Executive)\n\nIt\u2019s predicted that technology will improve, change or even replace many of\nthe tasks recruiters are currently performing all over the world, with 50% of\nrecruiting activity to be automated in the next three to five years.\n\nIn a session at HR Tech titled [\"Elevating the Role of a Recruiter With\nArtificial\nIntelligence,\"](https://s23.a2zinc.net/clients/lrp/hrtechnologyconference2019/Public/SessionDetails.aspx?FromPage=Sessions.aspx&SessionID=5133&SessionDateID=184)\nTracy Patterson, managing director for HR Services & Transformation in North\nAmerica and Europe at Accenture, said tomorrow's recruiters will have the\nopportunity to spend more time with candidates and hiring managers, but only\nif their organizations adopt the necessary technology to free them up to do\nso.\n\n**[READ MORE: Follow along here for our ongoing\ncoverage.](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-technology-\nconference/)**\n\nIndeed, artificial intelligence and machine learning tools like predictive\nanalytics, virtual assistance, digital screening, gamification and intelligent\nnetworking are already being used to improve processes and get recruiters back\nto what they're best at: recruiting.\n\n\"Recruiters are able to spend their time on the most important things,\"\nPatterson said, \"like selling candidates on why that job is important and how\nthe offer is competitive within the industry.\"\n\nPatterson says this is now happening at Accenture, which recently adopted an\napproach it calls \"human+recruiter\" that embraces \"human and machine\ncollaboration to elevate the role of the recruiter to be a talent coach and\nadvisor.\"\n\n[**HR Tech 2019: Findings** **from the just-released Sierra-Cedar\nreport**](https://hrexecutive.com/new-sierra-cedar-report-what-should-happen-\nafter-the-hr-tech-buy-in/)\n\nAccenture's new approach yielded a 94% satisfaction through the pilot period\nand greatly reduced the amount of time recruiters spend on administrative\ntasks.\n\nAnd while there are numerous bottom-line reasons to pursue a \"human+\nrecruiter\" approach, Patterson said, it will be up to HR leaders to drive\nadoption of any AI-based project.\n\n\"It's going to be your job to bring the entire organization along on this\njourney,\" she said.\n\nMichael J.

**Is Your Onboarding Strategy on Point?**\n\nHaving a stellar [onboarding\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/) is critical to\n[employee retention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/).\nAccording to research by Jobvite, a significant portion of your new hires is\nlikely to quit in just 90 days after joining their role. This makes the\nonboarding experience a key differentiator in how they perceive a company,\nengage with the job, and stay involved (or not) with your business objectives.\n\nAnd here are a few more metrics that drive home the need for a smart\nonboarding experience strategy. These findings are from a SilkRoad Technology\nreport titled U.S. Trends and Applications in **[Employee\nOnboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/)** , published earlier in 2019:\n\n  * 65% of employees say that an onboarding program helps to prepare for the next step in their career trajectory\n  * Organizations with a clearly outlined [onboarding process](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) enjoy 82% higher new employee retention, as well as a 70% uptick in productivity\n  * The average recruit must go through 54 different activities as part of their onboarding experience, suggesting a marked degree of complexity\n\n  \nAs we approach 2020, it is time to rethink the onboarding experience with a\nfocus on candidate engagement and long-term retention. Remember, the lessons\nlearned and the impressions made during these early days will be critical in\ndetermining whether top talent decides to stay on with your company.\n\nAn intelligent onboarding experience strategy, informed by a set of key best\npractices, will help you maximize each new resource that becomes part of your\nworkforce. Let\u2019s look at how to improve the onboarding experience in 2020,\nwith trends and examples to illustrate the way forward.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n## **How to Improve the Onboarding Experience: 10 Strategies to Remember**\n\nThe world\u2019s leading companies are now squarely focused on delivering the best\nonboarding experiences possible. Interestingly, this goes beyond the offer\nacceptance and joining stage \u2013 from the moment a candidate seriously considers\nyour organization as a potential employer, you should focus on having a\n**[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/)** strategy that\ntranslates into a stellar onboarding experience. Here are ten tips to help\nimprove your onboarding experience in 2020, minimizing early [attrition\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nattrition-complete-guide/)and disengagement risks.\n\n![10 ways to improve the onboarding experience for your new\nhires](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. 10 ways to improve the onboarding experience for your new hires**\n\n### **1\\. Make learning & development (L&D;) central to the onboarding\nexperience **\n\n  \nOnboarding is all about equipping a recruit to bring their very best to a\nworkplace from day one. If they spend weeks or even months familiarizing\nthemselves with your company, exploring self-service capabilities, and\nfiguring out how to complete routine tasks, they are being far less productive\nthan they can be.\n\nThis is why L&D; is vital for an enriched onboarding experience \u2013 learning\nmodules on essential software, short one-on-one sessions with a line manager,\nand pre-recorded videos on company values/ethics can go a long way in helping\nrecruits overcome their teething troubles.\n\nFor example, U.S.-based Hormel Foods Corporation adopted this strategy to\nredesign onboarding experiences in 2019. It deployed a gamified platform\ncalled Discovery Map\u00ae to allow new hires to learn information about the\ncompany quickly. This earned them the Silver Stevie Award in the Achievement\nin New Employee Onboarding category in 2019 as one of the best onboarding\nexperiences.\n\n### **2\\. Find innovative ways to inspire collaboration**\n\n  \nThere\u2019s no way around it. Collaboration is the cornerstone of engagement, and\nby inspiring recruits to collaborate with the workforce from day one, you can\nsubstantially improve the onboarding experience. There are many ways to do\nthis. For example, by scheduling an \"Onboarding Day\" every month/two months\ndepending on the size of your company, you can urge recruits to talk, share\ninsights, and resolve any concerns they may have about their future workplace.\n\nFor single-recruit onboarding experiences, you can invite participation from\nvarious stakeholders across the company, including team leads, vertical heads,\nand even C-level executives. Problem-solving exercises, quizzes, and\nquestionnaires are a great way to embed collaboration into your onboarding\nexperience.\n\nOne of the best onboarding experiences that leverages this collaborative model\nis practiced by Pinterest. The company\u2019s Knit SF onboarding strategy follows\nthe principles of knitting \u2013 using the term to refer to the collaboration of\npeople across the organization during the onboarding process. Activities like\npeer-to-peer icebreakers, candid chats with cross-disciplinary team leaders,\nand joining the company\u2019s Slack thread fall under this Knit SF framework. New\nhires are taken through all the departments of the organization to understand\nhow each function.\n\nIt also helps that despite having offices across the world, all new hires at\nPinterest begin their onboarding experience at the San Francisco headquarters.\n\n**Also Read:** **[10 Employee Onboarding Checklist Items You Can't Afford to\nMiss](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/employee-\nonboarding-checklist/)**\n\n### **3\\. Drive hiring managers to take greater ownership of the onboarding\nprocess**\n\n  \nBecause the onboarding experience involves multiple stakeholders across the\ncompany, there\u2019s always the risk that hiring managers may overlook a few key\ndetails. This challenge is compounded by the fact that onboarding is only one\ncomponent of a hiring manager's daily itinerary.\n\nAn excellent way to address this is by creating **[onboarding\nchecklists](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/employee-onboarding-checklist/)** that clearly lay out all the\nsteps required to improve the onboarding experience. Organizational leaders\ncan work together with the internal marketing team to schedule email updates\nthat inform and inspire hiring managers to take ownership.\n\nFor example, Google sends a manager \u201cjust in time\u201d onboarding checklists to\nassist with the onboarding experience. The company shares this list only 24\nhours before the recruit\u2019s arrival, ensuring a sense of immediacy and urgency.\nSome of these tasks on this list include having discussions with the new hire,\nassigning them a peer buddy, building a social network, setting up regular\ncheck-ins, and having transparent dialogues to identify how they feel about\nworking there.\n\nWith only one day to prepare, the manager is more likely to remember and focus\non each component. This small change to Google's onboarding experience\nstrategy improved results from onboarding by 25%.\n\n### **4\\. Integrate all the touchpoints on the employee onboarding journey**\n\n  \nAs mentioned, the typical employee must go through numerous activities and\nprotocols before they can complete the onboarding process. This can sometimes\nbe a fragmented experience, lowering the recruit's capability to remember and\nact on the information gained during onboarding. Integration of onboarding\ntouchpoints such as L&D;, admin, compliance, and workforce management could\nhelp to improve the onboarding experience significantly.\n\nFor example, instead of providing multiple hard copies for photographs for\ndocumentation, and then receiving an employee ID, the recruit can take a\nselfie or share a digital photo that\u2019s reused across various departments. Not\nonly does this dramatically cut down the onboarding timeline, but it also\nenhances the overall quality of experience.\n\nDell Boomi recognized the impact of this onboarding experience strategy after\nsurveying its employees last year. It found that 74% of the workforce didn\u2019t\nreceive a laptop on day one, and it took an average of 92 days before gaining\naccess to key applications and information.\n\nSo, the company developed an Onboarding Solution Accelerator that could\nresolve fragmentation in onboarding experiences by leveraging remote access,\nmobile competencies, and automation. Thanks to what is one of the best\nonboarding experiences we have seen so far, Dell saved 3.4 hours in admin\neffort per recruit and $5,600 in annual costs.\n\n### **5\\. Initiate the onboarding experience before the recruit steps into the\noffice**\n\n  \nEvery recruiter has undoubtedly come across this scenario: after a rigorous\nscreening process and negotiations, the offer is rolled out and accepted. But\nthe recruit changes their mind a few days before the joining date. This leads\nto massive sunk costs and overall inefficiency in your talent acquisition\npipeline.\n\nTo address this, it is crucial to extend the onboarding experience beyond the\noffice premises. By engaging with the recruit immediately after the offer\nacceptance, you can alleviate everyday worries (commute, career progressions,\ndiversity, etc.) and ensure that they do not look for greener pastures\nelsewhere.\n\nThat\u2019s why preboarding is now among the top onboarding experience strategies\nfor employers across the globe.\n\nWhen a high-tech electronics firm saw that an increasing number of recruits\nwere dropping off after receiving an offer, they started thinking about how to\nimprove the onboarding experience for their new hires.\n\nOne of the measures it took was designing a preboarding package that was\nmailed to the employee\u2019s home address. It included a company video,\ntestimonials by future colleagues, and detailed descriptions of the benefits\nthey could expect at the company.\n\nOnboarding experience best practices like this ensure that a recruit stays\nengaged with your organization until every formality has been completed.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Do You Measure These 5 Onboarding\nMetrics?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-five-onboarding-metrics/)\n\n### **6\\. Analyze the unique needs of varying recruit demographics**\n\n  \nThis is one of the key steps to improving your onboarding experience \u2013 not\nevery recruit will come with similar expectations, and the onboarding\nexperience cannot follow a one-size-fits-all model. There may be instances\nwhere engagement and community building should be at the forefront of the\nonboarding process.\n\nIn other cases, the experience should ideally pivot around the exchange and\ndissemination of information. Employers should conduct preboarding surveys to\ndetect these requirements early on, ensuring that the onboarding experience is\nin line with the recruit\u2019s individualized expectations.\n\nKPMG Belgium demonstrated a great example of this onboarding experience\nstrategy in action. The organization hires 170 graduates every year, in\naddition to 150 experienced hires. KPMG leveraged a combination of preboarding\npractices, content delivery systems, and process automation to improve the\nonboarding experience for these two unique categories.\n\nGiven that the cost of replacing a new graduate recruit could run up to 80% of\ntheir annual salary, you must try to deliver the best possible onboarding\nexperience to these young, ambitious professionals.\n\n### **7\\. Explore onboarding models for temporary and seasonal workers**\n\n  \nThe quality of the onboarding experience is as important for your temporary\nand seasonal workers as it is for employees joining the permanent company\npayroll. For sectors such as media and entertainment, retail, and healthcare,\nthe contingent workforce takes up a large part of their onboarding\ninvestments.\n\nA more efficient and optimized experience in this segment can help to deliver\nbetter results and save costs. It isn\u2019t enough to have temporary and seasonal\nworkers sign an offer and join the job \u2013 these are individuals who will be\nadvocates for your employer brand, who can effectively promote it to hire more\nworkers \u2013 even urgently if needed.\n\nA paper-based non-experience-focused onboarding journey brings down the\npossibility of a temporary worker choosing to work for you a second time\naround.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America (Denver) offers one of the best onboarding\nexperiences to its massive group of seasonal workers who join every year to\nstaff their summer camp. The company initially had a paper-driven, manual\nprocess where HR would go through every file to identify returning staff and\ncreate new folders for fresh recruits. This process took weeks to complete.\n\nBoy Scouts of America recently switched to an automated onboarding process\nthat doesn't require recruits to be physically present to furnish the\npaperwork. Owing to this new onboarding experience, the organization saved 48+\nhours in admin efforts and ensured a happier contingent workforce.\n\n### **8\\. Harmonize onboarding experiences across multiple locations**\n\n  \nProviding a consistent onboarding experience has always been a challenge for\nglobal/large-scale companies. Once the\n**[recruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-recruitment/)** process and offer rollout are over,\nregional offices follow their own practices until the recruit joins the\norganization. This could lead to a fragmented experience, dependent on the\ninterest and expertise level of local HR managers.\n\nTo achieve the same level of success across locations, it is essential to\nformulate a clear onboarding experience roadmap with strategic checks and\nbalances in place. This will also make it easier to introduce changes/upgrades\nto your onboarding model without requiring any major overhaul at each\nlocation.\n\nGlobal beverages company Bacardi provides a great example of this onboarding\nstrategy at work. Previously, Bacardi struggled with a different experience at\neach site, risking inefficient onboarding journeys at locations that were\nunderstaffed.\n\nTo improve the onboarding experience, the company now uses pulse surveys to\nshare and collect data over a 90-day welcome period. A buddy system and\nmandatory training are the other components of Bacardi\u2019s global onboarding\nprocess, which creates a seamless onboarding experience no matter where\nemployees join the company.\n\n### **9\\. Blend employee onboarding with continuous learning**\n\n  \nThe transition from the onboarding process (which can last from anywhere\nbetween two days and three months) to on-the-job practice, must be seamless.\nIt can be beneficial to measure employee skills at the time of joining and map\nhow it improves over time via onboarding as well as continuous learning.\n\nThe concept of **[strategic\nonboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/strategic-onboarding-plan-2019/)** involves the \u201ccontinuous\nonboarding\u201d of employees \u2013 a long-term strategy to keep employees engaged and\nrelevant for new positions within the company. It can even prepare them for\nleadership positions in the future. This can help you boost productivity and\nhelp employees reach their professional targets faster.\n\nO\u2019Shea Builders uses this onboarding tactic to raise the quality of talent in\nthe organization over time. At O\u2019Shea, onboarding and career development are\npart of the same process, guiding each employee through organizational and\ncareer goals. This is broken down into a two-part onboarding process, where\nthe first deals with new hire training and the second ask employees to define\nspecific development goals for themselves.\n\nThanks to customizable workflows and trackable progress, 83% of employees at\nO\u2019Shea Builders reported they were very satisfied with the onboarding and\ncareer development experience at the company.\n\n### **10\\. Factor in offboarding requirements right at the time of\nonboarding**\n\n  \nWith the average employment tenure gradually shrinking, your offboarding\nnumbers are likely to go up over the years. And the impressions made during\nthis crucial part of the employee journey will determine if they return to\nyour company, refer their acquaintances, and present your employer brand on\nsocial media.\n\nIt is advisable to take the data gathered during onboarding to frame an\nindividualized offboarding strategy. Apart from standard procedures in\ncompliance and admin areas, pulse surveys, one-on-one conversations, and a\ndiscussion on future opportunities are critical to offboarding.\n\nFor example, email automation startup Mailigen places offboarding at the heart\nof its employee-centric culture. The company realized that ineffective\noffboarding could result in sizeable costs, as rehiring an ex-employee is\noften better for business than looking for a new one. That\u2019s why Mailigen\ntreats the employee journey like any other relationship, where the\norganization must take care of first impressions, regular interactions, as\nwell as the closure to ensure the employer brand is maintained.\n\nThis is in addition to following the other onboarding experience strategies\nlisted above, including integration, collaboration, and an unwavering eye on\nengagement.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Top 10 Employee Onboarding Software for\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nemployee-onboarding-software/)\n\n## **Avoid These Pitfalls When Onboarding in 2020**\n\nThere are still a lot of wrinkles to be ironed out when it comes to improving\nonboarding experiences. Research by ServiceNow found that nearly a quarter of\nemployees receive no clear onboarding, and the company didn't note that it was\nan employee's first day in one out of ten cases.\n\nIf you\u2019re eager to learn how to improve onboarding experiences and deliver the\nbest onboarding experience to your 2020 recruits, make sure to avoid these\ncommon pitfalls:\n\n  * No alignment between onboarding and the reality of the job\n  * Giving the recruit full ownership for the first day, with zero handholding\n  * Setting performance benchmarks that become active without a transition period\n  * Information overload and exposure to a high number of technology platforms\n\n  \nSo these are among the top onboarding experience strategies that belong on\nyour radar as you look forward to a new year, marked by hiring success and\ncontinued engagement. As exemplified by these ten companies with the best\nonboarding experiences, the early days of an employee\u2019s journey are probably\nthe most formative, setting up the groundwork for a productive tenure at your\ncompany.\n\n_What measures have you taken to improve onboarding experiences in 2020?

It is a well-known fact that technology is going to enhance the\nquality of recruitment process and also take the burden off your shoulder.\n\nMany solutions have been introduced by technology to accelerate the\nrecruitment process. However, it has ruined the privacy to a greater extent.\n\n####  1\\. It helps you seek talent:\n\nThere are some technologies which are affordable when it comes to incorporate\nthem in recruitment. It enables the business to recruit many valuable people.\nThe technology works very fast in selecting people.\n\nThere is an application tracking system that can manage all the applications\nof candidates. This system also sorts the candidate in any desired order. The\njob openings resume, skill level and a lot of other things can easily be seen\nthrough application tracking system. Moreover, this application is also very\neffective if you want to import the resumes of candidates from one application\nto another.\n\n####  2\\. It Increases productivity:\n\nThe increased productivity of everything in the business increases the\neconomic growth. The technology provides automation due to which the time\nrequired to complete all the tasks is reduced. The ability of a business to\nretrieve and compile the date gets enhanced through technology. Organising the\ncandidates\u2019 details with hands is very time-consuming. Not to mention,\ntechnology saves the business from this hassle.\n\n####  3\\. Online testing:\n\nTechnology has made it easier for the companies to test the skills and\ncompetency level of the individuals applying for a job. [ESTA\nApplication](https://www.estavisaus.org/esta-application-form) is another\napplication of technology that makes it easier for the USA department to test\nthe applicants\u2019 documents. It is quite different from the visa system where\nonline testing is not done. This visa system is very complex and also\nincreases the time to select the individuals as it does not use much of the\ntechnology.\n\n####  4\\. The company becomes more strategic:\n\nThere should be a plan required to be used to manage all the tasks that a\ncompany needs to do a smoother recruitment process. The plan-making and\nmanagement depend on technology. If you are using built into technology, you\nare going to have more strategic planning.\n\nMany metrics can be measured in the recruitment process. It also saves you\nfrom having to spend a lot of money and time in recruitment and selection\nprocess.\n\nThe recruitment of embassies is also done through technology with different\nstrategies. The recruitment in visa processing department is being streamlined\nthrough technology. This visa department works more efficiently through\neffective applications incorporated into their system. There are a lot of\ndocuments one has to provide in the visa process. This visa process gets too\ncomplex and annoying at times for the staff that requires the hiring of more\ncompetent staff. The technology plays an effective role in the recruitment of\nthe [staff in the embassy when metrics of\nhiring](https://www.indeed.com/q-Embassy-Management-jobs.html) are known.\n\n####  5\\. Video interviewing saves time:\n\nVideo interviewing is considered as the best substitute for a traditional\ninterviewing process. It reduces the needs for telephonic or face to face\ninterview.

For enhancing\nprofitability and productivity, there is nothing quite like the right talent.\nAs McKinsey puts it, \u201cSuperior talent is up to eight times more productive.\u201d\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nThe question for leaders and innovators is\u2014once you attract the right talent,\nhow do you _manage people to promote productivity and retain staff_?\n\nBelow, we share some key tips for talent management in 2020.\n\n## **1\\. With the Right Staffing Software, Engagement Starts at \u201cHello\u201d**\n\nHave you ever found the perfect candidate only to be \u201cghosted\u201d\u2014your calls and\nemails not returned? Have you ever \u201cghosted\u201d a candidate? If the answer to\neither of these is yes, you might want to look at how you engage candidates\nand employees.\n\nThe very first minute you engage a candidate for a role, you are communicating\nhow your organization values and manages talent. It is all there in the tone\nyou strike and the respect you give off.\n\nIf you want to create a happier workplace and attract best-fit talent, you\nshould use candidate and employee engagement tools that embed engagement in\nthe recruitment process.\n\nBusiness texting is a great example. Today, [according to\nDeloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-\ntrends/2018/network-of-teams-connected-workplace.html), 18.7 billion text\nmessages are sent every day. If you want to meet candidates and employees\nwhere they are, you should use technology that has business texting\nfunctionality.\n\nBut don\u2019t take it too far. Candidates and employees today are emphasizing\nwork-life balance more than ever, and you don\u2019t want to seem like you\u2019re\ncrossing any boundaries.\n\n## **2\\. Think About Who Is Leading the HR Software Decision Cycle**\n\nWho is making your decisions on technology adoption and use? Who is leading\nyour digital transformation?\n\nIdeally, your organization does not have competing interests. Ideally, each\ndepartment works toward the betterment of the company. Ideally, the technology\nselection process is not veered off course by interests that work against the\noverall success of the company.\n\nThis is not always the case.\n\nTake automated, cloud-based software. If a decision-maker\u2019s job or\nproductivity might be affected by the adoption of software, they might have a\nvested interest in software that does not close gaps and create efficiencies.\nThat\u2019s an understandable emotion, absolutely. No one wants to feel like their\nvalue is being eroded. Rather than cutting that person out of the decision\ncycle entirely, let them know that you hear their concerns and will take them\ninto account.\n\nYet do not let that partner alone determine the course of your technology\nadoption. They might adopt technology that does not automate and ease\nprocesses, in favor of technology that underscores their own importance.\nAgain, this is understandable, but it is a hindrance to your organization.\n\nMake sure the decision to adopt technology is objective and based purely on\nwhat is best for the company. Technology can give you a talent management\nadvantage\u2014but only if it\u2019s right.\n\n## **3\\. Cloud-Based Software Is the Way to Go**\n\nWhat is cloud-based software? It is digital technology that lives in the\n\u201ccloud.\u201d Data is hosted by the software vendor, and the software can be\naccessed anywhere with an Internet connection.\n\nFor a more mobile, data-forward world, cloud-based software is the software of\nchoice. Hard installs are becoming a thing of the past.\n\nIt\u2019s generally a good practice to procure cloud-based software for your\npersonnel. Why?\n\nIf you lead any remote teams or have employees who sometimes work remotely,\ncloud-based software is going to come in use. Employees can access cloud\nsoftware from their home or remote machines.\n\nFor millennials and other modern employees, the ability to work remotely is\noften a big source of comfort when accepting a new role. And according to\n[recent studies](https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/people-who-work-from-home-\nare-happier-more-efficient-according-to-this-fascinating-study-theres-\nonly-1-catch.html), employees who work from home are happier, more efficient\nand easier to manage.\n\nThus, because cloud-based software allows employees to work remotely,\nacquiring cloud-based software can be a huge boon for modern organizations.,\n\n## **4\\. HR Software Can Create Efficiencies**\n\nDoes your team miscommunicate sometimes? Do several people find themselves\nworking on the same task or project without knowing it? Are there efficiency\ngaps that need to be closed?\n\nTime is expensive\u2014too much of it spent on manual tasks can be redundant for\nrecruiters and HR professionals, who would often rather spend their time\nrecruiting. By adopting digital, cloud-based platforms, you can cut time on\nredundant tasks, boost the speed of the team and improve profitability.\n\nYou can make the talent acquisition\u2014and management\u2014process into a comparative\nbreeze. With the proper recruiting technology, you\u2019ll unleash the potential\nwithin your organization, driving growth using your most productive\nresources\u2014your people and data.\n\nWhen talent is easily acquired, and recruiters have access to robust employee\nengagement tools, the whole team is lifted up and empowered. Employees are\nmore passionate and productive. Their triumph is shared; their victories are\none. The results are something to witness.\n\nTop-notch technology can unlock that for you.\n\n**Learn More:[Top 4 Recruitment Metrics Every Talent Acquisition Leader Must\nTrack](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-4-recruitment-metrics-every-talent-acquisition-leader-must-\ntrack/)**\n\n## **5\\. Good Talent Acquisition Is Good Talent Management**\n\nWho hasn\u2019t seen a great employee go? On the flip side, who hasn\u2019t hired an\ninitially promising employee who turned out to be less than optimal? In some\nsense that\u2019s always going to happen\u2014it\u2019s a fact in business and economics.\nHowever, what you can control is how you react to talent attrition.\n\nSo what _is_ the best way to react?\n\nUse talent acquisition technology that makes it easy to qualify and hire\ntalent at faster speeds, leading to more agile and confident recruiters.\nPowerful talent acquisition technology means peace of mind\u2014finally\u2014in a\nwhirlwind market.\n\nYes, there\u2019s no way of eliminating the risk of unexpected talent\n[attrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-attrition-complete-guide/). However, acquiring best-of-breed recruiting\nproducts can help you develop a talent acquisition strategy that works. By\nadopting the best staffing and recruitment software, you\u2019re enabling talent\nmanagement success for years\u2014if not decades\u2014to come.\n\n**Learn More:[Talent Acquisition vs. Recruitment: Key Differences and\nSimilarities](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-vs-recruitment/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2F5-best-talent-management-strategies-\nfor-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=5+Best+Talent+Management+Strategies+for+2020\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=5+Best+Talent+Management+Strategies+for+2020&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2F5-best-talent-management-strategies-\nfor-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2F5-best-talent-management-strategies-\nfor-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2F5-best-talent-management-strategies-\nfor-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=5 Best Talent Management Strategies for\n2020&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2F5-best-talent-management-strategies-\nfor-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

[+] approaches to attract the best talent.\n\nGetty\n\n  \n\nCapturing the attention of top talent in a highly competitive market that\ndefies all traditional recruiting methods is the greatest challenge companies\nface today. In a [candidate driven\nmarket](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-\nacquisition/pages/recruiting-is-tougher-2019.aspx), recruiters and human\nresource professionals don\u2019t have time to waste with lengthy and drawn out\ninterview processes. Yet, companies are struggling to restructure their\nexisting strategy by implementing one that grabs the attention of the new\ngeneration of workers.\n\nRecruiters are now faced with tapping into a more creative approach and\nadopting the mindset of the new generation to put themselves where their\ncandidates are. Known as the digital natives, the new generations have a\nrelatively short attention span giving companies only [8\nseconds](https://www.oberlo.com/blog/marketing-strategies-generation-z) to\ncapture their attention and engage them. If companies want to keep the\nattention of candidates, they need to interact with them via the channel of\ncommunication that their prospects use.\n\nCompanies such as Hilton, Home Depot, Google and Unilever have restructured\ntheir recruiting process to adapt to the needs of millennials and Generation\nZ. They\u2019ve found the most success by utilizing social media to advertise\nroles, reducing the complexities of the application process and being\nstrategic in how the interview process is organized.\n\nThese 3 strategies will help companies get the most out of their recruiting\nprocess while keeping top talent engaged.\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\n **Leveraging Face-To-Face Through Video Interviewing**\n\nThere\u2019s a reason [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) is ranked one of the most\npopular social media platforms. The video sharing platform helps YouTubers\nconnect on a deeper and more personal level with their audience. The same goes\nfor employers and candidates. Both parties can present themselves while\ngetting a feel for one another through body language and facial expressions.\n\nLeveraging a face-to-face connection through video interviewing helps reduce\ncosts while bringing a more human-like quality to the interview. This also\nhelps to eliminate stressors of an in-person interview such as transportation\nissues, no-shows, alerting the receptionist or having to handle difficulties\nwhen finding the office.\n\nHilton took a step further and found great success in using\n[HireVue](https://www.hirevue.com/), an in-demand digital interview platform\nthat allows the hotel chain to interview multiple candidates at once without a\nrecruiter being present. Since this is the first stage of the process, they\u2019re\nable to review the video and determine if the candidate would be a good fit or\nnot from the start. Implementing this has drastically [reduced Hilton\u2019s 45 day\ntime-to-hire process](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-\nsolutions/blog/recruiting-strategy/2018/how-4-companies-reduced-time-to-hire)\ndown to five.\n\n**Creating An Interactive And Engaging Experience**\n\nGamification isn\u2019t a new concept. In fact, gamifying has been around for\ndecades and it\u2019s only becoming more popular. With the tech industry booming,\ncompanies are seeing massive benefits in implementing gamification into their\nrecruiting and retention strategies.\n\nThe concept of gamification is less about gaming consoles and instead taking\nelements from video games to create an interactive and hands-on experience. In\n2016, [Unilever](https://unilever.com/) digitized their entire hiring process\ncreating a four step process that mixes videos and gaming elements. After\nsubmitting their application, candidates are prompted to play [12 games\nlasting about 20 minutes](https://breezy.hr/blog/3-easy-ways-to-simplify-your-\nhiring-process-with-examples) each. Each game is strategically structured to\nassess their skill set and see if they have what it takes to be carry out the\nresponsibilities of the position they\u2019re applying for.\n\nAfter completing each stage of the journey, there\u2019s a [two-way feedback\nfacility](https://simply-communicate.com/unilever-gamify-graduate-recruitment-\nonline-gaming/) where candidates can share their insights and experience while\nUnilever provides feedback on performance as well as areas of strength and\ndevelopment. If their feedback is positive, candidates are then instructed to\nsubmit a video themselves that will be reviewed by the recruitment team. If\naccepted, they\u2019re invited in for an onsite interview where they can experience\na day in the life of an employee at Unilever.\n\nFormaposte, a French postal service, struggled to reduce their 25% turnover\nrate costing the company a lot of money in hiring. Since launching the [Jeu\nFacteur Academy](http://formaposte-iledefrance.fr/alternance/facteur-\nacademy/), an interactive experience that allows candidates to experience what\na week in the position feels like, the postal company\u2019s turnover decreased to\njust 8%. Google, Domino\u2019s, Formaposte and Unilever are just a few companies\nwho are experiencing massive success by adopting a more gamified approach to\nkeep candidates engaged during the recruiting process.\n\n**Tapping Into Text Message Communication**\n\nRecruiters can quickly build a relationship with candidates and keep\nconversation flowing by utilizing text messages as their method of\ncommunication. According to ClearCompany, \u201c[80% of\npeople](https://blog.clearcompany.com/text-recruiting-stats-you-need-to-know)\nare now using text messaging for business.\u201d Ecallis confirms this in a [recent\narticle](https://ecallis.com/sms-mobile-text-marketing/) talking about the\nvalue text message marketing has with the current generation of workers.\n\nThe strategic marketing and creative advertising agency learned text is the\npreferred channel of communication from businesses for millennials and 89% of\njob seekers believe cell phones play an important role in the job search\nprocess. Companies would be doing themselves a disservice by not utilizing\nthis method of communication especially since text messages have a 98% read\nrate with millennials opening them within 90 seconds of receiving them.\n\nCandidates want to feel connected to their potential future employer. Texting\nnot only creates a more personalized approach to recruiting but it shows\ncandidates the company is approachable. Candidates place great emphasis on\ntheir interaction with the people interviewing them and use that experience to\nmake their final decision of whether or not they\u2019ll accept the job offer or\nmove forward in the interview process. Companies and recruiters who fail to\nadapt to new-age recruiting risk losing the best talent on the market.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/twitter.com/heidilynneco) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidilynnekurter/).

It can eliminate unconscious human bias, and it can assess the entire\npipeline of candidates rather than forcing time-constrained humans to\nimplement biased processes to shrink the pipeline from the start.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/10/Oct19_29_1169612876.jpg)\nVertigo3d/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2019/10/using-ai-to-eliminate-bias-from-hiring?language=es)\n\nLike any new technology, artificial intelligence is capable of immensely good\nor bad outcomes. The public seems increasingly focused on the bad, especially\nwhen it comes to the potential for bias in AI. This concern is both well-\nfounded and well-documented. But what is AI? It is the simulation of human\nprocesses by machines. This fear of biased AI ignores a critical fact: The\ndeepest-rooted source of bias in AI is the human behavior it is simulating. It\nis the biased data set used to train the algorithm. If you don\u2019t like what the\nAI is doing, you definitely won\u2019t like what humans are doing because AI is\npurely learning from humans.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on hiring. The status quo of hiring is deeply flawed and quite\nfrankly dystopian for three primary reasons.\n\n**Unconscious human bias makes hiring unfair.** The typical way of reviewing\napplicants prior to an interview is through recruiters reviewing resumes.\nNumerous studies have shown this process leads to significant [unconscious\nbias against women](https://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474),\n[minorities](https://www.nber.org/papers/w9873.pdf) and [older\nworkers](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/el2017-06.pdf).\n\n**Large pools of applicants are being ignored.** LinkedIn and other sourcing\nplatforms have been so successful that, on average, 250 applicants apply for\nany open role. This translates into millions of applicants for a few thousand\nopen roles. This process obviously cannot be handled manually. So, recruiters\nlimit their review of the applicant pool to the 10% to 20% they think will\nshow most promise: [those coming from Ivy League campuses](/2015/10/firms-are-\nwasting-millions-recruiting-on-only-a-few-campuses), [passive candidates from\ncompetitors](/2019/05/recruiting#your-approach-to-hiring-is-all-wrong) of the\ncompanies seeking to fill positions, or [employee-referral\nprograms](https://qz.com/299923/why-job-referrals-matter/). But guess what?\n[Top colleges](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/24/us/affirmative-\naction.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-\nheading&module=photo-spot-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0) and\n[employee-referral\nprograms](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-28/does-asking-\nemployees-to-recommend-friends-make-workplaces-less-diverse) are much less\ndiverse than the broader pool of applicants submitting resumes.\n\n#### Insight Center\n\n  * ###### [AI and Bias](/insight-center/ai-and-bias)\n\nSponsored by SAS\n\nBuilding fair and equitable machine learning systems.\n\n**Traditional hiring tools are[already\nbiased.](http://economics.mit.edu/files/599)** This is permitted by a loophole\nin U.S. law: Federal regulations\n[state](https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/factemployment_procedures.html) that\na hiring tool can be biased if it is job-related. \u201cJob-related\u201d means that the\npeople who are successful in a role show certain characteristics. But if all\n\u201csuccessful employees\u201d are white men, due to a history of biased human hiring\npractices, then it is almost certain that your job-related hiring assessment\nwill bias towards white men and against women and minorities. An African\nAmerican woman from a non-Ivy League college who is lucky enough to become\npart of the pipeline, whose resume is reviewed, and who passes the human\nrecruiter evaluating her resume may then be asked to take a biased assessment.\n\nIs it any wonder we struggle to hire a diverse workforce? What has led to\ntoday\u2019s chronic lack of diversity, and what will continue to stunt diversity,\nare the human paradigms in place today, not AI.\n\nAI holds the greatest promise for eliminating bias in hiring for two primary\nreasons:\n\n**1\\. AI can eliminate unconscious human bias**. Many current AI tools for\nrecruiting have [flaws](/2019/05/recruiting#data-science-cant-fix-hiring-yet),\nbut they can be addressed. A beauty of AI is that we can design it to meet\ncertain beneficial specifications. A movement among AI practitioners like\n[OpenAI ](https://openai.com/charter/)and the [Future of Life\nInstitute](https://futureoflife.org/) is already putting forth a set of\n[design principles](https://futureoflife.org/ai-\nprinciples/?submitted=1#confirmation) for making AI ethical and fair (i.e.,\nbeneficial to everyone). One key principle is that AI should be designed so it\ncan be audited and the bias found in it can be removed. An AI audit should\nfunction just like the safety testing of a new car before someone drives it.\nIf standards are not met, the defective technology must be fixed before it is\nallowed into production.\n\n**2\\. AI can assess the entire pipeline of candidates rather than forcing\ntime-constrained humans to implement biased processes to shrink the pipeline\nfrom the start.** Only by using a truly automated top-of-funnel process can we\neliminate the bias due to shrinking the initial pipeline so the capacity of\nthe manual recruiter can handle it. It is shocking that companies today\nunabashedly admit how only a small portion of the millions of applicants who\napply are ever reviewed. Technologists and lawmakers should work together to\ncreate tools and policies that make it both possible and mandatory for the\nentire pipeline to be reviewed.\n\nAdditionally, this focus on AI fairness should have us evaluate existing pre-\nhire assessments with the same standards. The U.S. Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (EEOC) wrote the existing fair-hiring regulations in\nthe 1970s \u2014 before the advent of the public internet and the explosion in the\nnumber of people applying for each job. The EEOC didn\u2019t anticipate modern\nalgorithms that are less biased than humans _yet also_ able to evaluate a much\nlarger, more diverse pipeline. We need to update and clarify these regulations\nto truly encourage equal opportunity in hiring and allow for the use of\nalgorithmic recruiting systems that meet clear criteria. Some precedents for\nstandards have already occurred. The California State Assembly passed [a\nresolution](https://fairhiringca.com/how-to-end-biased-hiring-in-california/)\nto use unbiased technology to promote diversity in hiring, and the San\nFrancisco DA is using [\u201cblind sentencing\u201d\nAI](https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/SF-DA-Gasc-n-launching-tool-to-\nremove-race-when-13971721.php) in criminal justice proceedings.\n\nThe same standards should be applied to existing hiring tools. Amazon was\nnationally [lambasted](https://slate.com/business/2018/10/amazon-artificial-\nintelligence-hiring-discrimination-women.html) for months due to its male-\nbiased hiring algorithm. Yet in the United States today, employers are legally\nallowed to use traditional, biased assessments that discriminate against women\nor minorities. How can this be? Probably because most people are unaware that\nbiased assessments are prominently used (and legal). If we are going to call\nfor unbiased AI \u2014 which we absolutely should \u2014 we should also call for the\nelimination of all biased traditional assessments.\n\nIt is impossible to correct human bias, but it is demonstrably possible to\nidentify and correct bias in AI. If we take critical steps to address the\nconcerns that are being raised, we can truly harness technology to diversify\nthe workplace.\n\n* * *\n\n[Frida Polli](/search?term=frida%20polli&search_type=search-all), a cognitive\nneuroscientist, is the co-founder and CEO of pymetrics, a platform that uses\nbehavioral science and AI to match people to jobs accurately and fairly.\n\n* * *\n\n###### This article is about [TECHNOLOGY](/topic/technology)\n\n__Follow this topic\n\n__Following\n\nRelated Topics:\n\n  * [Hiring](/topic/hiring)\n  * [Human resource management](/topic/human-resource-management)\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\n#### Partner Center\n\n[Coronavirus](/insight-center/coronavirus) [Magazine](/magazine)\n[Popular](/most-popular) [Topics](/topics) [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n[Video](/video) [Store](/store) [The Big Idea](/big-ideas) [Visual\nLibrary](/visual-library) [Reading Lists](/reading-lists) [Case\nSelections](/case-selections)\n\n[![Harvard Business Review Home](/resources/css/images/hbr_logo.svg)](/)\n\n[**Subscribe**](/subscribe)\n\n###### Explore HBR\n\n  * [The Latest](/the-latest)\n  * [Most Popular](/most-popular)\n  * [All Topics](/topics)\n  * [Magazine Archive](/magazine)\n  * [The Big Idea](/big-ideas)\n  * [Reading Lists](/reading-lists)\n  * [Case Selections](/case-selections)\n  * [Video](/video)\n  * [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n  * [Webinars](/webinars)\n  * [Visual Library](/visual-library)\n  * [My Library](/my-library)\n  * [Newsletters](/email-newsletters)\n  * [HBR Ascend](https://hbrascend.org/)\n\n###### HBR Store\n\n  * [Article Reprints](/store/articles)\n  * [Books](/store/books)\n  * [Cases](/store/case-studies)\n  * [Collections](/store/collections)\n  * [Magazine Issues](/store/magazine-issues)\n  * [HBR Guide Series](/store/landing/guides)\n  * [HBR 20-Minute Managers](/store/landing/20-minute-managers)\n  * [HBR Emotional Intelligence Series](/store/landing/emotional-intelligence-series)\n  * [HBR Must Reads](/store/landing/mustreads)\n  * [Tools](/store/tools)\n\n###### About HBR\n\n  * [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n  * [Advertise with Us](/hbr-advertising-sales)\n  * [Information for Booksellers/Retailers](/booksellers-retailers)\n  * [Masthead](/about-hbr)\n  * [Global Editions](/global-editions)\n  * [Media Inquiries](/media-inquiries)\n  * [Guidelines for Authors](/guidelines-for-authors-web)\n  * [HBR Analytic Services](/hbr-analytic-services)\n\n###### HBR Subscriber Assistance\n\n  * [Subscribe](/subscribe)\n  * [Subscriber Help](/subscriber-help)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.274.3214](tel:+18002743214)  \n[harvard@cdsfulfillment.com](mailto:harvard@cdsfulfillment.com)  \n[hbr.org/subscriberservices](/subscriberservices)\n\n  * International:  \n[+44.1858.438.412](tel:+441858438412)  \n[(Asia Pacific: +61.2.9158.6127)](tel:+61291586127)  \n[hbr@subscription.co.uk](mailto:hbr@subscription.co.uk)  \n[subscription.co.uk/hbr/help](https://www.subscription.co.uk/hbr/help)\n\n###### HBR.ORG Customer Assistance\n\n  * [Help Center](/help-customer-service-home)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.988.0886](tel:+18009880886)\n\n  *   * International:  \n[617.783.7500](tel:+16177837500)\n\n  * Email:  \n[customerservice@harvardbusiness.org](mailto:customerservice@harvardbusiness.org)\n\n  * [Copyright Permissions](/permissions)\n\n###### Follow HBR\n\n  * __[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/HBR)\n  * __[Twitter](http://twitter.com/HarvardBiz)\n  * __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review?trk=biz-companies-cym)\n  * __[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harvard_business_review/?hl=en)\n  * __[Your Newsreader](http://feeds.hbr.org/harvardbusiness/)\n\n![Harvard Business Publishing](/resources/images/2018/new_logo_May11.png)\n\n  * [About Us](/corporate/about)\n  * [Careers](/corporate/careers)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n  * [Copyright Information](/corporate/copyright)\n  * [Trademark Policy](http://trademark.harvard.edu/pages/trademark-notice)\n\n  \n\nHarvard Business Publishing:\n\n  * [Higher Education](http://hbsp.harvard.edu/)\n  * [Corporate Learning](http://www.harvardbusiness.org)\n  * [Harvard Business Review](http://hbr.org/)\n  * [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Harvard Business School Publishing.

I\u2019ll talk\nspecifically in relation to tech, as that\u2019s what I\u2019m familiar with, but\nanecdotally I hear reports across other sectors of horror stories. It\u2019s up to\nus hiring managers help it change or even remove it completely.\n\nLet me explain why.\n\nLast year I interviewed a software engineer in Sydney. He explained how he had\nspent collectively two weeks out in Silicon Valley interviewing and going\nthrough a series of tests at four major tech giants. It left him exhausted as\nhe had to fit them all into a short period of time. No one could be expected\nto be in top form after the fourth personal grilling of the morning.\n\nCoincidentally the developer was interviewing with us to work on a new\nplatform we were building to improve the hiring of developers. (If you\u2019re\nfamiliar with Laddr, then let me preface the rest of this post by saying that\nwhile Laddr aims to solve some of these issues, there are better solutions.)\n\nTo give you an idea of the size of the problem, there will be an estimated [26\nmillion software developers globally by\n2022](https://www.tradeandinvest.lu/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/nexten_software_developers_study_europe.pdf).\nBut that\u2019s not enough. The World Economic Forum highlighted our profession as\none that [will continue to be in-\ndemand](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x9-jKYAew1w-4PN78uXejYZzyXJPNRnkDpE-K6M7aNI/edit),\nas forecasts estimate that 1 million programming jobs will be unfilled by next\nyear in the US alone. In Washington DC we represent [over 6% of the\nworkforce](https://www.daxx.com/blog/development-trends/number-software-\ndevelopers-world). Yet despite our growing number, the approach for how we\u2019re\nhired hasn\u2019t changed in a decade, back before mobile optimization was\nstandard.\n\n[![VB TRansform 2020: The AI event for business leaders. San Francisco July 15\n- 16](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/VBTransformInContent.png?strip=all)![VB TRansform\n2020: The AI event for business leaders. San Francisco July 15 -\n16](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/VBTransformInContent.png?strip=all)](https://www.vbtransform.com/)\n\nIt takes on average [40.8 days to hire a software development\nengineer](https://www.glassdoor.com/research/time-to-hire-in-25-countries/).\nFor us that\u2019s the length of time for most projects. So it\u2019s safe to assume\nopportunities are being missed.\n\nCollectively, we need to remove some barriers. Here are a few ideas how:\n\n## 1\\. Remove bias\n\nYou vastly increase your possible talent pool (not to mention, strengthen your\nteam) when you remove bias from your hiring system. Whether it\u2019s gender bias\nthat\u2019s been baked into your job description unknowingly, or subconscious bias\nduring the selection phase, we already have the tools to remove this. And\nbefore you think, \u201cOh, we don\u2019t need that; we\u2019re not prejudiced,\u201d please read\n[this and other\nresearch](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=422902) on the\ntopic.\n\nChrome extensions like [Unbias\nMe](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unbias-\nme/bghhadboobnoikppffdojcebigmcgmam?hl=en) can help hide names and profile\npics when looking at LinkedIn or GitHub. And to write that unbiased job role,\ntry online platform [Gender Decoder](http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/)\nby Kat Matfield. Atlassian also recently announced a [tool to help HR teams\nwith diversity](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/balanced-teams),\narguing that demographically homogeneous teams lack effectiveness.\n\nThere have been headlines in recent years where [even algorithms are being\naccused of bias](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/10/amazon-\nhiring-ai-gender-bias-recruiting-engine), where coding has favoured male\ncandidates. It\u2019s helped startups like [Pymetrics gain\nfunding](https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/27/pymetrics-raises-40-million-for-\nai-powered-job-recruitment/) with platforms that combine AI and neuroscience\nto increase diversity in hiring at companies including Unilever and Accenture.\n\n## 2\\. Know what to offload\n\nDo you need to control every element, or can you introduce time saving\nautomation? Rhetorical questions aside, the use of chatbots to answer simple\nquestions has [already shown it frees up time for customer service\nteams](https://venturebeat.com/2018/08/28/why-dumb-bots-are-your-smartest-\ncustomer-service-move-vb-live/). Yet in recruitment it also means candidates\nlooking outside work hours, i.e. most people, can get the answers they want,\nwhen they need them. Which should hopefully increase applications.\n\nHowever more people applying doesn\u2019t help if they\u2019re not filtered\nappropriately, as up to 60 percent of applicants will be unsuited to the\nposition on offer. Machine learning platforms can do the necessary filtering\n(Canadian outfit [Ideal](https://ideal.com/) is one such platform, but there\nare others). However, the algorithms need to be designed carefully so that\nthey don\u2019t filter out promising candidates who happen to have non-traditional\nbackgrounds. One approach, which will ensure outliers aren\u2019t ruled out based\non the lack of a college degree, for instance, is to focus on tech tests that\nreplicate real life scenarios. By making these contextual problems rather than\ntheoretical ones, you can get a better sense of someone\u2019s transferable skills.\nBots can also then schedule interviews, another time sapping part of\ninterviewing.\n\n## 3\\. Give more power to applicants\n\nReversing the hiring model, so that companies can find pre-vetted technology\nprofessionals directly, are platforms like [talent.io](https://www.talent.io/)\nin Europe. It offers users the chance to describe their ideal role. Companies\nare then invited to make approaches based on the blurb. Personal information\nlike name, location, age, can remain anonymous through platforms including\n[Nottx](https://www.nottx.com/) \u2014 proof that the current model can be inverted\nwhile protecting users from discrimination.\n\nThis may just be from my engineer\u2019s perspective, but having to complete a\nseparate tech test for each role I\u2019m applying for feels unnecessary. And\nmaking applicants sit in your office isn\u2019t optimizing either party\u2019s time.\n[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) allows individual skills and\nproficiencies to be tested remotely. In fact, there are other platforms that\nare baking these tests into the profile users create, similar to an online\nportfolio for a creative. One contextual test to rule them all.\nCongratulations, your future staff will thank you.\n\nI expect we may soon see users getting paid for doing custom tech tests, as\nthis info could be used to provide information on the industry as a whole.\n\n## 4\\. Be transparent\n\nOne feature I haven\u2019t seen yet, but would like to, is the ability for an\nemployer to see all other competitors a candidate is interviewing with. This\nshould provide the catalyst to ensure great candidates don\u2019t get away. Almost\n70 percent of job seekers across the board believe response times during\ninterviewing can be improved. No wonder. Most are waiting 40+ days for an\nanswer. Some people could have completed four project assignments in that\ntime.\n\nAs the workforce of the future moves towards one increasingly [reliant on\ncontingent workers](https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/02/us-gig-workers-get-\nsupport-from-private-companies-but-public-policy-lags/), speed is the\npotential differentiator for hiring teams and employees alike.\n\n## 5\\. Abandon your recruiters\n\nWithout wanting to be the harbinger of doom for the recruitment industry,\nthere are ways in which the role is already changing. And I haven\u2019t even\ndiscussed the use of video in the discovery, interview, and in-role phases.\n\nDirect conversations between employers and candidates will lubricate the\nprocess and result in happier campers on both sides of this equation. So,\nrecruiters, the question is, how do you still add value? Over to you.\n\n_Vaibhav Namburi is founder of emerging tech\nagency[Five2One](https://www.five2one.com.au/). _\n\n##  VB Transform\n\nThe AI event for business leaders\n\nSan Francisco\n\nJuly 15 -

acquisition leaders from six leading organisations get\ncandid and creative with_ Aditi Sharma Kalra _on their vision of recruitment\nin the near future, underpinned by a serious commitment to transformation in\nHR._\n\nWhat happens when you get six HR and talent acquisition leaders to comment on\nthe future of the recruitment function? Absolute fun and creativity, yet a\nseriousness and dedication towards making constant upgrades to the way they\nrecruit, onboard and engage the best talent.\n\nIn this feature, prepare to read short stories on HR\u2019s vision of recruitment\n2020.\n\nAnd since it\u2019s almost unfashionable (unfathomable, even) these days to look at\nchange across a five or 10-year timeline, we are sticking to a timeline of\n2020 in reviewing such transformative changes.\n\nWe asked these leaders what they wish to change about the recruitment\nfunction, and how they propose to make this change a reality (essentially, the\n\u201cwhat\u201d and \u201chow\u201d) \u2013 read on for their insightful, yet out-of-the-box\nresponses.\n\n### Wish one: Video r\u00e9sum\u00e9s\n\n**James Foo, head of group human resources, ABR Holdings**\n\nThe what: Increasingly, organisations worldwide are making use of technology\nto streamlinework processes. However, there are still many companies yet to\njump aboard the  \ntech bandwagon in areas such as recruitment and selection.\n\nI hope they will become largely digital by 2020. Specifically, the usage of\nvideo r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, that goes beyond the traditional way of applying for a job\nduring the recruitment process.\n\n> ##### When job ads ask candidates to submit video r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, specify that they\n> are required to introduce themselves briefly as well as answer a few\n> questions.\n\nThe how: First, sell the idea and benefits to the board/top management. Next,\ndecide on the video clip details such as duration. For instance, when job ads\nask candidates to submit video r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, specify that they are required to\nintroduce themselves briefly as well as answer a few questions that are\ntailored specifically for the position.\n\nThis is very useful as it will allow HR recruiters to assess candidates in\ntheir own time (that is, 24/7) anytime, anywhere. Video conferencing can be\nused to interview the shortlisted candidates, while candidates who meet\nfurther requirements will be invited for a face-to-face final interview.\n\nAmong the things to note, we need to list the pros and cons, and selection\ncriteria for the pre-screening and video interview guidelines to ensure\nfairness.\n\n### Wish two: Advanced customisation in job searches\n\n**Delphine Leong, talent acquisition manager, Meltwater Asia Pacific**\n\nThe what: In addition to the need for an intuitive and universal job portal,\nmore needs to be done on the technology front for advanced customisation of\nfilters and requirements in job searches for a stronger tie-back to the\nrecruitment objectives of each organisation. For example, working in the tech\nspace, there\u2019s such a wide range of candidate skills that it would be useful\nto have a platform where we can zero in on specific areas of expertise, saving\ntime for both the job seeker as well as the employer.\n\n> ##### I believe there is a need for greater collaboration between employers\n> and job portals to better accommodate companies\u2019 recruitment needs.\n\nThe how: We foresee that technology will play a critical role in changing how\nwe identify, assess and connect with talent. But hand-in-hand with that, I\nbelieve there is a need for greater collaboration between employers and job\nportals to better accommodate companies\u2019 recruitment needs and challenges,\nparticularly as more skill sets become nuanced. This could be addressed with a\nmore streamlined and universal platform which can also be customised or\nfiltered to cater to different industry contexts.\n\n### Wish three: Blending AI with a human touch\n\n**Shmeer Bharoocha, regional talent acquisition and country lead (Europe and\nAmerica), ANZ**\n\nThe what: Expecting an entirely new way of working and recruiting is something\nall of us should prepare for. One example of a tool organisations should\nconsider is artificial intelligence (AI). However, given the early days of AI,\nI don\u2019t believe a candidate\u2019s entire interview journey should only be through\nrobots and machines. The human touch is and will continue to be not only\nimportant, but also relevant in recruitment. The idea is to utilise technology\nas a tool to augment the recruitment process and assist in simplification\nwhere possible.\n\n> ##### The decision on a candidate\u2019s part on whether to join your firm could\n> be down to very fine margins \u2013 like having to go to your office to return a\n> signed document.\n\nThe how: I would highlight three key aspects for HR leaders to bear in mind to\nmake this change a reality. The first is to adopt a \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d\nand growth mindset. Studies have shown that Millennials make up most of the\nearly adopters in technology. Failure to recognise this may mean you could\npotentially lose out on attracting the best talent in the market.\n\nThe second would be to acknowledge that the speed at which we attract talent\nmight be determined by how much technology we utilise.\n\nThe decision on a candidate\u2019s part on whether to join your firm could be down\nto very fine margins \u2013 like having to go to your office to return a signed\ndocument versus mailing over an electronic version.\n\nThe third is to keep up to date with trends in the market. It is always good\nto know what your competitors are doing and what tools they invest in to\nsupplement their recruitment process.\n\n### Wish four: Hiring via an app\n\n**Natalie Wright, HR director, Supernova**\n\nThe what: I would like to see the entire recruitment process become more tech-\nfocused. Perhaps hiring via an app that can match candidates to your role\nbased on keywords or questions. Employer branding is key and I would love to\nsee recruitment take more of a marketing focus utilising Instagram, Facebook,\nand Pinterest through videos.\n\n> ##### I\u2019d love to replace the CV submission with a short five to 10-minute\n> video for candidates to apply for roles and to include VR technology.\n\nThe how: I think we need to become less rigid in the recruitment process and\nmove away from the traditional CV. I\u2019d love to replace the CV submission with\na short five to 10-minute video for candidates to apply for roles and to\ninclude VR technology. Company culture fit is so important, but when it comes\nto talent acquisition you can\u2019t always read that on a CV.\n\n### Wish five: Bots and machine learning\n\n**Sreejith Nambiar, regional head, talent acquisition, Asia Pacific and Japan,\nAutodesk**\n\nThe what: Recruitment has been transforming in terms of both mindsets and\ntechnology. From being solely a recruiter\u2019s job, nowadays everyone needs to\nthink like a recruiter in the company, given how hyper-connected we all are to\nbusiness results.\n\nSpeed matters. Earlier, people provided feedback on a monthly basis, where\ntoday\u2019s demands call for feedback on a weekly or daily basis. The way we look\nat talent and engagement, we can only expect the speed of decision making to\ngo faster in 2020.\n\nFrom a technology standpoint, I\u2019d like to see HR start using bots and machine\nlearning to manage a lot of the initial screening and competency tests. That\nmeans recruitment becomes a specialist role, that is, high on soft skills,\nhigh on candidate experience and high on creativity.\n\n> ##### Adapting game-changing technology and making sure it is customised for\n> your company is essential.\n\nThe how: Adapting game-changing technology and making sure it is customised\nfor your company is essential, which means HR leaders and their teams spend\nmore time re-evaluating their current skills, culture, competencies, and more.\n\n### Wish six: Automation and artificial intelligence\n\n**John Bush, VP talent acquisition, Zendesk**\n\nThe what: I would love to see automation and artificial intelligence (AI)\nimprove the current candidate experience, all the way from application to\noffer. The process needs to be more engaging and transparent so the applicant\ncan truly embrace and feel the employer\u2019s value proposition through every\nstep, without the clunky systems and bureaucracy that is experienced today.\n\nAlso, I would love to see AI reduce a recruiter\u2019s burden of sifting through\nr\u00e9sum\u00e9s and scheduling interviews.\n\nAllowing AI to drive initial unbiased selection and organise interview\nschedules would increase the velocity of pipelines and allow recruiters to\nfocus on more impactful areas such as driving robust external sourcing\nstrategies, diversity, interview assessment and training, improved candidate\ncare, and proactive consulting.\n\n> ##### There needs to be an ongoing partnership by talent acquisition to\n> consult with the business in order to develop the trust to try something\n> different.\n\nThe how: Technology needs to advance to allow for front-end automation and\nimproved candidate experience. This is happening now at a rapid pace, so the\ntechnology is not far off from becoming mainstream.\n\nThere also needs to be an ongoing partnership by talent acquisition (TA) to\nconsult with the business in order to develop the trust to try something\ndifferent and allow new ways of connecting and accelerating candidates into\nthe interview process. TA is the people business. No technology will ever\nreplace recruiters, but rather will take away mundane tasks that impede\nrecruiters from doing what they do best \u2013 finding and hiring great talent.\n\n* * *\n\n### HR leaders and their vision for recruitment in 2020 [  \n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/12103301/Aditi-Nov-2018-recruitment-inforgraphic-Ash-\nprint.jpg)](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/12103301/Aditi-Nov-2018-recruitment-inforgraphic-Ash-\nprint.jpg)\n\n### [[read the full interviews](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/hr-\nleaders-and-their-vision-for-recruitment-in-2020/)]\n\n### _**Read the full feature in the September edition of Human Resources,\nSingapore:**_\n\n[![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/09/20154416/09hrsg_sep18_bulletin-157x180.jpg)](https://issuu.com/humanresourcesonline/docs/hrsg_sep18)\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).
