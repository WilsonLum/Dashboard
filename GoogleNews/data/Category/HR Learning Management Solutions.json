A product team will work hard to get to know that\ncustomer and how the organization's products and services can be continuously\nimproved to make them more successful. But what if you don't work in product?\nWhat if you work in Human Resources and are in charge of learning and\ndevelopment? What if you work in the legal department and your remit is\ncybersecurity policy for the company? Do you still make a product? Do you have\ncustomers? If you believe in bringing agility to the entire organization, the\nanswer to both questions is yes.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/04/Apr20_07_1162572100.jpg) Jorg\nGreuel/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/04/bring-product-thinking-to-non-product-\nteams?language=es)\n\nAt its most basic definition, a product is the way an organization delivers\nand captures value. For teams doing daily product work, it can feel relatively\neasy to define the words _product_ and _customer_. Whether it\u2019s a jet engine,\nan insurance policy, an online banking app, or mobile phone service there is\nan end customer who purchases and uses that product (athough, occasionally,\nit\u2019s a different person). A product team will work hard to get to know that\ncustomer and how the organization\u2019s products and services can be continuously\nimproved to make them more successful.\n\nThis is the core of organizational agility \u2014 shipping improvements to our\nproducts, observing and measuring customer behavior, determining whether we\nshould continue to improve or move on to something else. The faster we learn,\nthe faster we improve. Product teams \u2014 especially digital product teams \u2014\nunderstand this fundamentally.\n\nBut what if you don\u2019t work in product? What if you work in Human Resources and\nare in charge of learning and development? What if you work in the legal\ndepartment and your remit is cybersecurity policy for the company? Do you\nstill make a product? Do you have customers? If you believe in bringing\nagility to the entire organization, the answer to both questions is yes.\n\nThe question then becomes, how do you know you\u2019ve delivered value? Or captured\nit back? In a lot of cases these teams measure success by delivering on goals\nor initiatives. Did you launch the new learning management system? Success!\nDid you deliver the new cybersecurity policy to our vendors? Great job!\n\nBut do you know if this was really the best version of that policy or\ninitiative?\n\nTo answer that question, I believe we have to apply product thinking to every\nproject, initiative, and policy we create. In doing so we begin to move our\nnon-product and tech disciplines \u2014 HR, Finance, Legal, Logistics, et al \u2014 away\nfrom an output-based mindset and closer to the agile, customer-centric view\nwe\u2019re instilling in our product teams.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: an HR business partner is charged with defining,\nevaluating, buying, and implementing a new learning management system (LMS)\nand training curriculums for the entire organization. They diligently go about\nthis task getting bids, sitting through presentations, and ultimately hiring a\nvendor to build, integrate, and deploy the LMS. Congratulations? Not so fast.\nWhat if no one uses the new system? What if staff only takes the mandatory\ncourses but never explores the additional offerings the HR business partner\nspent weeks procuring and evaluating? What if the LMS itself is unusable and\nthe email volume to the HR team triples with staff complaints?\n\nEnter product thinking. If we\u2019re going to bring our non-product teams along\nwith us on our journey to business agility we have to reframe their work with\nthe language of products and customers. This begins by rethinking the\ninitiative not as a set of boxes to tick but rather as a problem to solve for\na specific set of customers. The measure of success for that problem is not\nthe deployment of a product but instead a measurable positive change in the\nbehavior of those customers. In other words, we\u2019re working towards outcomes,\nnot outputs.\n\nLet\u2019s reframe the LMS example above in this way. Instead of asking our HR team\nto research and deploy the system, the HR Business Partner or leader should\nposition it like this:\n\nOur current professional development efforts are rarely used due to lack of\nstaff awareness, difficult to find and use systems, and a catalog of offerings\nthat are irrelevant for a modern, digital workforce. This is causing a spike\nin attrition of our most valuable employees, increasing our recruiting and\nhiring costs, and hurting organizational morale \u2014 not to mention the wasted\ncost of these systems. How might we deliver better professional development\nofferings to the entire staff and ensure they\u2019re up to date on the latest\ntrends in digital business and feel like the organization is invested in their\nsuccess? We will know we\u2019ve succeeded when we see retention rates go up by 10%\nquarter over quarter, consumption of professional development content increase\ntwofold, and cost of hiring decrease by 15%.\n\nIn reframing the work for our HR team in this way, we\u2019ve done several things:\n\n  1. We\u2019ve reframed the initiative from \u201claunch an LMS\u201d to \u201cmake our people more successful.\u201d This is inherently a customer-centric focus. In this case the customers are the employees of the company.\n  2. We\u2019ve removed any mention of a solution from the assignment. This empowers our team to generate their own ideas, evaluate those ideas and determine the best course of action to make their \u201ccustomers\u201d more successful. In turn, they are more invested in the ideas they come up with and will look more broadly for innovative solutions.\n  3. We\u2019ve set clear success criteria that ensure our teams take an active interest in understanding their customers and work to continuously improve the \u201cproduct\u201d they\u2019re putting into their hands. It\u2019s no longer enough to deploy an LMS. The HR team now has to ensure its usage and then assess whether that usage is indeed a key driver of retention, hiring costs and other metrics the organization cares about.\n\nTo reduce the risk of choosing a solution (or product) that won\u2019t achieve the\nintended results, the team now has to undertake a more iterative and\nexploratory approach. They have to generate hypotheses about how to best\nachieve the desired results articulated in their problem statement. They then\nhave to test their hypotheses, get feedback from their customers or users, and\niterate those ideas based on that feedback. Sound familiar? This is exactly\nwhat customer-facing product teams do to ensure they\u2019re always delivering and\ncapturing as much value as possible.\n\nThe odds of deploying an unusable LMS with irrelevant content decrease\ndramatically when the HR team applies product thinking to their initiative. In\nfact, the end result may not end up being an LMS at all. For some companies\nsuch systems might be replaced by tactical, high-quality. in-person trainings,\nfor example.\n\nThis idea is not limited to HR, obviously. If your legal team authors\ncontracts, then those are their \u201cproducts.\u201d Your vendors are the customers of\nthose products. If a contract is irrelevant to a particular type of vendor\nyour teams will spin multiple, costly cycles customizing their templates. To\nreduce those red-line cycles, the team needs to understand the needs of their\ncustomers and deliver the most relevant contracts for each customer type.\n\nThese concepts may not be common place yet in non-product disciplines and the\norganization may wonder where to begin. Inevitably, this kind of\ntransformation, like any major change, requires leadership support and\nunderstanding. Training a team of leaders and individual contributors to put\nthese new ways of working into action is a good place to start. Once they\nunderstand how to frame the work, explore solutions, and most importantly, let\ngo of ideas that solve the customer\u2019s problem, they can share and scale their\nlearnings with the rest of the department.\n\nProduct thinking is popular with many organizations today because it brings\nthe ideas of agility, not just a templated agile process, to the product\nteams. These ideas, however, are not limited to product and tech teams.\nOrganizational agility is a welcome transformation in every department. By\napproaching the work you do as a product with specific customers, giving your\nteams problems to solve and measuring their success with outcomes, rather than\noutputs, you create a company-wide customer-centric culture and ensure that\nwhether someone is buying a product from you, is employed by you, or contracts\nwith your organization you\u2019re always maximizing both their success and yours.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2012/05/110-Jeff_Gothelf.jpg)\n\n[Jeff Gothelf](/search?term=jeff%20gothelf&search_type=search-all) is an\norganizational designer and executive coach.

The Answer Lies in a \u201c5M Model\u201d**\n\nIf employees get a negative impression of or face major bottlenecks in the\nworkplace in the first few months, it could drive them to leave the\norganization. So early in the employee journey, they are still not rooted in\nthe organizational culture, and this makes the separation easier. To prevent\nthis, companies need a five-step employee training plan that addresses the\nneeds of new employees head-on.\n\n![The five Ms of an effective employee training plan](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig. 1. The five Ms of an effective employee training plan**\n\n###\n\n### **1. _Mitigate_ the steep learning curve**\n\n  \nMost employees joining your company will have a steep learning curve in the\ninitial stages.\n\nThis is especially true for fresh graduates who have joined the workforce for\nthe first time. Even mid-career professionals who are transitioning from a\ndifferent field could face difficulties in acclimatizing themselves to the\nexpectations of their new roles.\n\nThese employees need to feel comfortable and confident so that they can easily\nacquire new skills/knowledge.\n\nThis involves three steps:\n\n**a. Conduct group onboarding:** To alleviate any newcomer anxiety, it\u2019s a\ngood idea to conduct group\n[**onboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) where recruits can connect with\nother employees who are going through a similar experience.\n\nEssential employee training elements, such as compliance, workforce management\nprotocol, and HR policies, can be explained during group onboarding sessions.\n\nYou can then hold short tests, polls, and quizzes to check for knowledge\nretention \u2013 and follow up with interactive emails after one week to overcome\nthe forgetting curve.\n\n**b. Assign an \u201cearly-days\u201d mentor:** Unlike a typical mentorship program, an\nearly-days mentor wouldn\u2019t aim for outcome-focused employee training. Instead,\nthe mentor is a friend to the new employee, ready to solve queries, answer\nquestions, and assist them in their daily job.\n\nKeep in mind the 70:20:10 equation, which suggests that 70% of learning\nhappens through experience, 20% by interacting with one\u2019s immediate community,\nand 10% through formal learning. Assigning a mentor strengthens the impact of\nthat 20% in your employee training plan.\n\n**c. Allocate one week for shadowing:** By introducing employees to complex\nconcepts and theoretical knowledge, companies risk overwhelming the learner\nwhen they have just joined the organization.\n\nA designated week for shadowing allows new employees to observe their\npeers/seniors, ask questions, and gain a real-world understanding of the job.\n\n### **2. _Mobilize_ new employees\u2019 existing strengths **\n\n  \nOnce an employee has crossed the initial learning phase, it\u2019s time to nurture\nthe potential for which they were hired.\n\nAn employee may not immediately fit in with their assigned team or be able to\ncollaborate with their manager. In such situations, focus on employees\u2019\nexisting strengths so that they aren\u2019t demotivated. This is relevant\nspecifically for employees venturing into a new career path or when they have\ntaken on a new role in the organization. Several skills are inherently\ntransferable (soft skills like communication or hard skills like design) and\nshould be showcased at this stage of your employee training plan.\n\nThis involves three steps:\n\n**a. Adopt strength-based coaching:** Coaching is no longer limited to senior\nexecutives. Mobile platforms like Pluma make coaching sessions accessible to\nmiddle managers and frontline employees.\n\nStrength-based coaching highlights what an employee can do best and nurtures\nthis potential. This coaching tactic can also inspire employees more\neffectively than critical feedback, minimizing the risk of demotivation.\n\n**b. Find cross-department synergies:** After employees shadow their own team\nmembers in the first week on the job, allow them to shadow managers in\ndifferent departments and business units in the following weeks. This will\nhelp them understand your company's vision more clearly and help them\nfamiliarize themselves with the various departments, their roles, the bearing\nof these departments on employees' work.\n\nIn some cases, cross-departmental synergies can be leveraged at a later stage\nto address skill gaps through\n[i](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/why-\ninternal-mobility-is-key-to-building-the-workforce-of-the-future/)nternal\nmobility. That's why this step is so essential for your employee training\nplan.\n\n**c. Take a reverse-mentoring approach:** Reverse mentoring occurs when a\nsenior executive is paired with a new/junior employee to encourage a free-\nflowing, non-linear skills exchange.\n\nBy participating in a reverse mentorship, employees can forge new connections\nwith their colleagues (cutting across generational divides), and discover\nunique strengths that could add value to your company.\n\n**3. _Maintain_ a regular learning track**\n\n  \nThe first two steps focus on empowering new employees and helping them obtain\nthe soft skills needed to interact meaningfully with their teams.\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to implement a formal L&D; plan that incorporates self-learning\nand classroom learning sessions in equal measure. Classroom sessions are\nvital, as they add structure to the employee learning journey and help track\ntheir progress in real-time.\n\nFor this, you would benefit from using e-learning platforms with analytics\ncapabilities.\n\nThis step comprises three further steps:\n\n**a. Offer mobile learning opportunities:** In the first few months, an\nemployee will be engaged in interactions with multiple stakeholders to find a\nfirm foothold in the organizational structure.\n\nAs a result, they may not be able to dedicate uninterrupted hours to learning\nand development. You can address this by incorporating mobile learning into\nyour employee training plan. This may prove particularly beneficial for\nmillennials and Gen Z, who are mobile-natives.\n\n**b. Ensure in-the-moment learning is available** : Coming back to the\n70:20:10 formula, 70% of all learning occurs through work experience. This\nmakes in-the-moment learning an integral component of your employee training\nplan, and even more so for employees who are new to your workflows.\n\nCoaching tips embedded in productivity applications, informative alerts, and\ntimely redirection to learning resources can help employees learn as they\nwork.\n\n**c. Leverage real-time learning data:** Employees mustn't veer from their\nlearning tracks, at least in the first few months of joining a company. You\ncan ensure this by monitoring learners' progress in real-time and sharing\nreports with the employee.\n\nThis will aid in self-motivation.\n\n### **4. _Monitor_ progress with controlled tests**\n\n  \nLearning data may not always accurately portray the progress that an employee\nhas achieved. Here\u2019s where controlled tests can make a difference. These tests\nplace the employee in real-world scenarios, urging them to try out their newly\nacquired skills for meaningful output.\n\nDo note that employees must feel like they are in a _safe_ environment when\nactioning these skills without any worries around being reprimanded.\n\nThis involves three steps:\n\n**a. Simulate real-world work scenarios:** Now is the time for organizations\nto incorporate cutting-edge technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and\nvirtual reality (VR) to test employee skills in simulated, safe environments.\nThis way, tests are decoupled from critical outcomes, but the employee still\nhas a chance to experience the impact of hands-on training memorably.\n\nYou can even embed visual cues and coaching tips into the AR/VR experience,\nacknowledging the right use of skills and alerting employees wherever they go\nwrong.\n\n**b. Hold \u201c100% ownership days\u201d:** This extends the ambit of testing a little\nfurther. On 100% ownership days, the recruit is given end-to-end\nresponsibility for a specific task, including customer interactions, decision-\nmaking, and micro-level leadership.\n\nThis component of your employee training plan allows employees to study the\nimpact of work in day-to-day situations. Of course, a manager/supervisor must\nbe present at hand to intervene if necessary.\n\n**c. Recognize learning achievements:** A significant part of monitoring\nprogress is to recognize and appreciate the milestones that an employee has\nsuccessfully crossed. This may range from a simple \u201cthank you\u201d for easing a\nteam member\u2019s workload, to a formal email announcement when the employee\nattains a mandatory certification.\n\nRecognition also allows learners to track their progress over time, motivating\nthem to accelerate their journey on the learning curve.\n\n**5. _Measure_ at increasing intervals**\n\n  \nContinuous review, along with regular fine-tuning, is essential for any\nemployee training plan, and this applies to new employees well. It is\nadvisable to increase the measurement interval on an incremental basis. The\nfirst checkpoint is every week for the first month. Then, measure learning\nprogress every month for the next quarter. Finally, move to a quarterly\nmeasurement cycle.\n\nThis will ease the learning curve we spoke about in step 1 and allow employees\nto gradually blend into your existing workforce and its culture of learning.\n\nThis step involves three elements:\n\n**a. Check for individual as well as team-wise outcomes:** Individual\nperformance can only go so far. Employees must display key traits like\nteamwork, collaboration, the ability to empathize with colleagues, and\nnecessary foresight.\n\nLearning measurement must factor in team-wise outcomes. We recommend using\npre-onboarding findings as a benchmark and assessing the value the employee\nadds to the team after joining.\n\n**b. Pay equal attention to hard and soft skills:** Too often, an employee\u2019s\nhard skills are highlighted, while their \u201csoft\u201d capabilities (which are\nequally important) pass under the radar. It can be challenging to measure\nprogress in terms of soft skills development. This is where you need peer\nreviews and 360-degree performance feedback.\n\nThe employee\u2019s team members, as well as colleagues from other teams who\ninteracted with them in the _mobilize_ stage, can rate the impact of training\nin terms of soft skills.\n\n**c. Prioritize culture fitment and add for the first year:** One cannot\noverestimate the role of culture fit, and eventually culture add in the\nemployee experience and employees\u2019 overall success in the organization.\n\nYour employee training plan must necessarily include training on the company\u2019s\nculture, from diversity and inclusion to company policies, values, and ethics.\nOnce again, use peer reviews to understand how the culture fit and culture add\nhave improved from week 1 to month 1 to quarter 1, and finally, to year 1.\n\n## **#ProTip: _Maneuver_ the New Employee Learning Experience Using the Right\nTools **\n\nTraining new employees is a multifaceted and dynamic process. No employee\ntraining plan is a set-and-forget initiative, which is why learning analytics\nis so important. Regular tests and data monitoring reveal how employees are\nprogressing across the learning track designed for them to reach their full\nproductivity potential.\n\nBy following the 5M model, companies can address both expressed and latent\nemployee expectations and streamline their learning and development path in\nthe organization.\n\nStrengthen this path further by using targeted learning tools. Here are three\nexamples of such tools:\n\n**1.**[ **SAP Litmos**](https://www.litmos.com/platform/new-employee-training)\n**:** Litmos is the learning management solution (LMS) from the global\nsoftware giant SAP. Litmos has a robust training module, which includes a\ndedicated capability for new employee training management.\n\nYou can leverage Litmos for compliance training \u2013 one of the key elements of\nany onboarding experience \u2013 as well as for knowledge dissemination in\nspecialized business, social, and technical topics. Further, Litmos is easily\nscalable based on your hiring speed and capacity.\n\n**2.**[ **Eloomi**](https://eloomi.com/) **:** Eloomi is an onboarding\nplatform that pays special attention to how you train new employees. The\nplatform has several built-in content programs that can be customized based on\nyour employee training plan.\n\nYou can reuse frequently implemented learning materials in areas such as\nsecurity and compliance. And view progress across all these paths in real-\ntime, with follow-ups via face-to-face meetings. As an additional feature,\nEloomi offers preboarding capabilities for greater candidate/employee\nengagement.\n\n**3.** [**Talmundo**](https://www.talmundo.com/onboarding-software-solution)\n**:** Talmundo\u2019s onboarding software offers an effective solution to train new\nemployees. The employee starts receiving notifications as early as 10 days\nbefore joining the company. These notifications share information on the\ncompany\u2019s overall positioning as well as job-related information.\n\nTalmundo covers the entire new-hire lifecycle \u2013 for example, at the 60-day\nmilestone, it asks onboarding employees about their specific areas of interest\nthat they would like to develop across their tenure.\n\n## **Wrapping Up**\n\nPlatforms like SAP Litmos, Eloomi, and Talmundo can make your employee\ntraining plan productive and successful. Coupled with the 5M model, you can\nhone a new employee\u2019s true potential and enable them to maximize their\nperformance.\n\nThe key is to anticipate initial bottlenecks, institute measures that\nstreamline the learning experience, and blend employee training with the\nworkplace experience. This will lead to sustained outcomes, encouraging\nemployees to continuously grow and scale new frontiers as they progress across\ntheir tenure in the company.\n\n_What does your new employee training plan look like in 2020?

They may be upskilled to perform better in their existing roles\nor reskilled to take on new roles in the organization and fill the skills gap\nthat is becoming common in the workplace these days.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nPerformance is just one of the intended outcomes of L&D; \u2013 it also has several\nother benefits, such as employee satisfaction, future-proofing your business,\nenhanced **[employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience/)** , and increased retention. Typically, L&D; is\ncategorized as part of a company\u2019s overall talent management strategy, where\nlearning is used as a means to acquire, nurture, maximize, and retain talent.\n\nLearning and development was [Deloitte\u2019s top human capital\ntrend](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-\ntrends/2019/reskilling-upskilling-the-future-of-learning-and-\ndevelopment.html#endnote-sup-3) in 2019. 86% of respondents to Deloitte\u2019s\nsurvey said that improving their L&D; capabilities was an \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cvery\nimportant issue.\u201d\n\n### **How does learning and development work?**\n\n  \nThe L&D; process can be broken down into five key steps:\n\n**1.**[ **Talent gap\nanalysis**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-gap-analysis/) **:** An assessment of your existing\ntalent landscape to identify skills shortage, improvement areas, and possible\nopportunities in line with current/future business objectives.\n\n**2\\. L &D; strategy formulation:** The selection of different L&D; components\nthat will make up the learning experience (e.g., hands-on training, executive\ncoaching, mentorships, etc.).\n\n**3\\. Procurement:** Partnerships with L&D; providers \u2013 internal and external\n\u2013 and onboarding them into the organization (could include consultants,\ncoaching organizations, L&D; technologies, etc.)\n\n**4\\. Execution:** The implementation of your L&D; strategy via the learning\npartners and technologies selected, either in groups of employees or\nindividually.\n\n**5\\. Measurement and review:** Measurement of the success of your L&D;\nprogram against the talent gap analysis initially conducted after program\ncompletion.\n\nThis five-step process encapsulates how most L&D; strategies progress. This\nprocess can be perfectly aligned with your business priorities, keeping in\nmind the budgets and timelines allocated for talent development at your\ncompany.\n\nThe last step is probably the most critical, as it reveals valuable insights\ninto which key performance indicators (KPIs) were met and which ones fell\nshort of the desired target. This will help you realign L&D; component\nselection and investment in the next learning cycle.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **A Career in Learning and Development: 10 Must-Have Skills\nto Make It Big in 2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/skills-for-a-career-in-learning-and-development/)\n\n### **What are the different components of learning and development?**\n\n  \nIt's essential to keep in mind the various components that make up the\nlearning experience. Typically, experts recommend following the 70:20:10 model\nwhen designing an L&D; strategy.\n\nThe 70:20:10 framework suggests that a majority of the learning happens on the\njob.\n\n  * **Employees are likely to pick up 70% of their skills through their daily jobs.**  \nThis is particularly true for young professionals who have just entered the\nworkforce.\n\n  * **Employees obtain 20% of their skills and knowledge through their peers and colleagues.**  \nThis is why it is so essential for HR to place employees in the right teams,\nassign the right managers, and ensure that the managers are trained to develop\nteam members who report to them.\n\n  * **10% of all learning happens through formal training sessions.**  \nWhile this may seem like a small number, classroom sessions continue to be\nnecessary, especially for large organizations. It helps to track learner\nparticipation and engage with large groups at the same time.\n\n  \nThe 70:20:10 framework isn\u2019t set in stone. But it is a useful rule of thumb to\nkeep in mind when evaluating and selecting the various L&D; components\navailable to you. These could include:\n\n**1.** **Mentorships:** A popular L&D; method where a dedicated mentor is\nassigned to every employee. You could also try out reverse mentoring where\nsenior professionals learn from their team members.\n\n**2\\. MOOC:** Massive open online courses (MOOC) are excellent for sharing\nshort, bite-sized content that employees can fit into their busy work\nschedules. MOOCs can be paid or free, undertaken with partial sponsorships by\nthe company.\n\n**3\\. Certifications:** End-to-end degrees that massively increase a person\u2019s\nemployability. Certifications can be transferred from one organization to\nanother, making them highly relevant across an employee\u2019s career pathway.\n\n**4\\. Hands-on training:** Domain-specific skills taught on the job or in\ncontrolled scenarios. They can be enhanced through the use of AR (augmented\nreality) and VR (virtual reality). Hands-on training is generally a mandatory\npart of the learning experience.\n\n**5.**[ **Learning management systems\n(LMS)**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\na-learning-management-system-lms/) **:** A platform where companies can host\ndigitally-consumable learning material to be accessed through multiple\ndevices. The content can be created either in-house or outsourced to a\nspecialized contractor.\n\n**6.** [**Learning experience platform\n(LXP)**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\na-learning-experience-platform-lxp-and-can-it-replace-your-lms/): Similar to\nan LMS, but comes with ready-to-consume content and is hosted/managed entirely\nby the L&D; partner. A good example is LinkedIn Learning.\n\n## **4 Key Objectives of a Learning and Development Program**\n\nThe objectives of employee development will vary from company to company. For\nexample, a manufacturer may want to increase the volume of items produced per\nquarter. Or a school may want to improve students\u2019 test results by upskilling\nits teachers.\n\nIn other words, the specifics of your development and learning objectives will\ndepend on the nature of your company and the area of operations. However, it\nis possible to classify these objectives into four categories:\n\n### **1\\. Business performance**\n\n  \nThe two examples we just mentioned will result in an uptick in business\nperformance through L&D.; Improved business performance is usually the top\nobjective of every development and learning activity. Essentially, it implies\nthat companies are training employees to become better at their jobs and\nmeet/exceed the business KPIs assigned to their jobs.\n\nLearning and development objectives pertaining to business performance\ninclude:\n\n  * Increase in the volume of work completed within a stipulated time\n  * Rise in customer satisfaction scores as a result of better employee performance\n  * The ability to gain from emerging opportunities, due to new skills available in the organization\n  * Business sustainability through a period of dynamic changes (regulatory shifts, economic upheavals, digital transformation, etc.)\n\n###  \n**2\\. Employee satisfaction**\n\n  \nResearch suggests that employees value the importance of learning in the\nworkplace and would stay on with a company that invests in L&D.; [LinkedIn\u2019s\n2019 Workplace Learning\nReport](https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report),\nwhich surveyed 3,000+ respondents, reaffirms this insight. A whopping 94% of\nrespondents said that they would stay on in a company that invests in their\nlearning and development.\n\nLearning and development objectives pertaining to employee satisfaction\ninclude:\n\n  * Increase in employee retention rates\n  * Improvement in your **[employee net promoter score (eNPS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/employee-net-promoter-score-enps-definition-measurement-examples-ideas/)**\n  * Reduction involuntary turnover in the long term\n  * Lowering of employee stress, thanks to a rise in confidence and skill levels\n\n###  \n**3\\. Employer branding**\n\n  \nAnother objective to remember when formulating a learning and development\nstrategy is its impact on your employer brand.\n\nDoes your company appear to be \u201clearning-focused\u201d?\n\nDo candidates want to join your company because it will help their careers and\nlong-term growth?\n\nThese are some of the key questions that an L&D; program should answer. Most\npreferred employers in the world \u2013 the likes of Google, Amazon, and PwC \u2013\ninvest heavily in their employee\u2019s development, as it is intrinsically linked\nto their value proposition in the labor market.\n\nLearning and development objectives pertaining to employer branding include:\n\n  * Shorter time to fill for new job roles\n  * Increase in the quality of hire\n  * Reduction in recruitment marketing costs\n  * An uptick in the number of unsolicited/inbound applicants\n\n###  \n**4\\. Individual self-actualization**\n\n  \nIn the era of new work, employees value the holistic aspects of a job as much\nas its tangible components like benefits or compensation. As a result, L&D;\nbecomes a means of self-actualization and fulfillment, allowing employees to\ntap into their full potential. And this is linked both to business performance\nas well as employee satisfaction.\n\nDevelopment and learning objectives pertaining to individual self-\nactualization include:\n\n  * The ability to reach personal improvement targets\n  * Enhanced work-life balance enabled by robust skill sets\n  * Increased employability, driving greater job security\n  * Realization of hidden potential such as leadership skills or a knack for working with data\n\n  \nCompanies should look at the above four objectives buckets before implementing\nan L&D; strategy. Let\u2019s now turn to some of the best practices that can help\nyou get it right.\n\n## **7 Best Practices for Creating a Learning and Development Strategy in\n2020**\n\nWhile the exact formula and structure for L&D; might vary based on your unique\nobjectives, several best practices can set you on the right track. Here are\nseven best practices to keep in mind when shaping your learning and\ndevelopment strategy, regardless of industry/business type:\n\n![the definitive guide to learning and development, along with definition,\nstrategies, and best practices](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. Best practices to create a robust learning and development strategy**\n\n### **1\\. Factor in the requirements of a multigenerational workforce**\n\n  \nIn 2020, the oldest Gen-Zer turns 25, ready and qualified to take on their\nfirst job. This is also the decade when baby boomers reach their 60s,\nresulting in a spate of new learning requirements. To keep up, companies will\nhave to create multigenerational learning tracks with different learning and\ndevelopment best practices for millennials, Gen Z, Gen X, and baby boomers.\n\nTactics like reverse mentoring will be particularly useful, allowing older\nemployees to gain from the skills of digitally native millennials and Gen\nZers.\n\n### **2\\. Embrace the power of mobile learning**\n\n  \nThe mobile learning market is currently booming. By 2025, mobile learning will\ncross $42 billion, at a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.5%.\n\nMobile learning strengthens the impact of that 70% of knowledge/skills\nemployees that pick up on the job \u2013 employees can quickly refer to the company\nLMS using a mobile device when they face a bottleneck at work.\n\nMobile access also gives learners the flexibility to pursue learning material\nanytime, anywhere. They could potentially turn the ideal hours spent during\ntheir commute or waiting at the airport, for example, into opportunities for\nself-learning.\n\n### **3\\. Use technology intelligently to personalize the learning\nexperience**\n\n  \nCompanies must explore how technology could enable personalized learning. With\nbusiness requirements continually evolving, and so many generations now making\nup the standard office, personalization can help you adapt to individual\nneeds.\n\nAs Jeff Freyermuth, principal research analyst at Gartner, put it: \u201cThe\ntraditional, one-size-fits-all approach to L&D; will no longer cut it in the\nnew work environment.\u201d\n\nTechnology can help create automated, intuitive, and interactive learning\nworkflows that adapt to employee behavior. This should be bolstered by regular\nsurveys to get a clear understanding of different employee personas[\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-an-\nemployee-persona/)and their diverse learning needs.\n\n### **4\\. Pay special attention to harassment and discrimination prevention**\n\n  \nIn 2020, learning and development could prove to be vital in preventing\ndiscrimination and harassment in the workplace. This, in turn, will enrich\nyour employee experience and enhance the employer brand.\n\nSome local governments such as the New York City Commission on Human Rights\nmandate companies of a specific size to conduct anti-sexual harassment\ntraining.\n\nYou can partner with specialized learning vendors in this space. You could\nalso invest in training for unconscious bias elimination, curbing the problem\nat the very roots. In these areas, tools like virtual reality are tremendously\nhelpful.\n\n### **5\\. Embed L &D; into the larger HR landscape **\n\n  \nThis best practice is all the more relevant for large enterprises. For\nworkforces with thousands of employees, L&D; is designated as a separate\nfunction, independent from HR. Over time, this could lead to an entirely\nsiloed approach, with little collaboration between HR and L&D.; As a result,\nyou have limited visibility into how your L&D; program impacts people's\noutcomes, and L&D; centers purely on business performance.\n\nTo avoid this pitfall, large enterprises should embed L&D; into their HR\nlandscape, with decision-makers such as the chief learning officer (CLO)\ncollaborating with the chief human resources officer (CHRO).\n\n### **6\\. Leverage L &D; as a tool for succession planning**\n\n  \nA rapidly aging baby boomer workforce means that there will be a wave of\nretirements in 2020, affecting thousands of senior leadership roles around the\nworld. HR must step up and action an effective succession plan. A carefully\ndeveloped learning and development strategy can help you address the gap,\nnurturing employees\u2019 latent leadership skills.\n\nTargeted measures such as one-on-one coaching and [soft skills\ntraining](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-ar-\nand-vr-are-revolutionizing-soft-skills-training-in-2019/) are suited to a\nsuccession-ready learning and development program. Further, employees who are\nassigned as mentors will acquire valuable skills, such as strategic decision-\nmaking, responsiveness, perceptivity, and conflict resolution.\n\n### **7\\. Make learning an ongoing process**\n\n  \nL&D; shouldn\u2019t be looked at as a one-off initiative. Instead, look at talent\ndevelopment as a continuous development approach by integrating learning with\neveryday workflows.\n\nThis also means that employees do not have to specifically take out time to\ncomplete their learning modules. Making learning an ongoing process, embedded\nit into the flow of work, will increase participation rates, and ensure that\nthe forgetting curve is avoided.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Future of Work: 10 Key Trends for the Next 10\nYears**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/future-of-work-key-trends/)\n\n## **Wrapping Up: Tools to Use for Learning and Development**\n\nNow that you know what learning and development is, its key objectives, and\nsome best practices, you\u2019re ready to select tools that can accelerate the pace\nof learning and strengthen its impact in your organization.\n\nSome of the top tools to look at include:\n\n  * LinkedIn Learning: An employee experience platform\n  * Moodle: A customizable open-source LMS\n  * Coursera, Udemy, and other MOOC libraries\n  * Adobe Captivate, SAP Litmos, and other cloud-based LMS\n\n  \nCompanies embarking on their L&D; journey in 2020 should keep in mind its\nvarious nuances and possibilities. There is no one-size-fits-all model \u2013 the\nunique mix of objectives, timelines, budgets, and technology dependencies at\nyour organization will determine your learning and development strategy.\n\nBut there's a clear endgame applicable across the board \u2013 making learning a\ncore element of your culture so that the company and its workforce are\nresilient to the rapid pace of transformation we are experiencing today.\n\n_Is there learning and development best practice that's proven effective at\nyour company?

So what is the disconnect?\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | March 17, 2020\n\nTopics: [Digital Transformation](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/digital-\ntransformation/) | [Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/hrtechnology/) |\n[Leadership](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/leadership/)\n\n_Tom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/83424484_m.jpg)\n\nInjecting new or updated technology into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover US$5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a US$250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% said the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, said Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner.\n\nTinder said her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe said. In fairness, she noted, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn\u2019t matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder said. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don\u2019t have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d\n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, said that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she said, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille said.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explained.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explained. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he added.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte said, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he said, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears said. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nSears said traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder said, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears said, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook said, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he said. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook said. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook said HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concluded. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Dissecting+the+employer+disconnect+in+HR+technology&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

In a\nworld where drowning in information is easier than actually pinpointing the\ndata we need, Priya Sunil covers all stages of the people analytics journey\nthrough conversations with leaders who walk the analytics talk.**\n\nWhile I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard the one-liner about numbers hiding as much as\nthey reveal, I\u2019m hoping you haven\u2019t heard this one yet: \u201cStatistics is the art\nof never having to say you\u2019re wrong.\u201d Perhaps the one-liner has some truth to\nit, as decisions today have become impossible without the right data.\n\nIn a world where information is easy to access, and in fact, available in a\ndeluge, having the right data at your fingertips is the difference between a\nslow and uncertain decision versus a prompt and 90%-sure decision.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, people analytics has become a hot topic among industry\nleaders today, with more businesses recognising the need for this approach.\nWherever you are in your people analytics journey \u2013 be it in the awareness\nstage, the early stage of implementation, or at the later stage where you\u2019re\nlooking to revamp your existing model \u2013 this feature is for you.\n\nThrough conversations with leaders who walk the talk in the industry, this\nfeature delves into the key questions you may have such as, does people\nanalytics need a big team? Not necessarily, as you\u2019ll learn through a chat\nwith **Daniel Kusmanto, ASM\u2019s Global Head, HR Analytics**. What challenges can\nyou anticipate in the process? **Tham Weng Yip, HR Lead, Talent Management and\nProjects, Brenntag Asia Pacific** , tells us. But before all that, what do you\nneed to first ask yourself before embarking on this journey, or revamping it?\nWe find out from **Sajjad Parmar, Head of Reward APAC, eBay**.\n\n**How people analytics turns data into meaningful insights**\n\n**_Sajjad Parmar, Head of Reward APAC, eBay, believes before implementing a\npeople analytics model, leaders need to ask the \u2018why\u2019 before working on the\n\u2018what\u2019. He shares his take on how companies are taking this approach today, in\nan interview with Priya Sunil._**\n\n**Q What are the typical business needs which drive a firm\u2019s people analytics\nmodel?**\n\nHaving the right talent gives companies a competitive advantage. Much of the\nresearch on what worries CEOs is around having the right talent in the\norganisation and the skills to do critical jobs. If so, then getting the right\ntalent, managing and engaging them will have a massive impact on companies\u2019\nability to not only do well and grow, but to also sustain for the long term.\n\nEvery decision around people becomes important, especially when we think about\nthe constant challenge around acquiring the best people for your organisation.\nA lot of decisions we make on people are based on data and facts \u2013 so, the\nbetter we get at decisions based on insights, the better the outcomes.\n\nIf people are a company\u2019s biggest asset, then companies need to make sure what\nthey do will have the best impact on both the company and their employees.\n\nThe adoption of people analytics arises from **the need to do what is right\nfor the business and its people** ; **increase fairness and transparency** ;\nand **looking at factors and variables that sometimes we, as humans, normally\ndo not think about or appreciate**.\n\n> ##### After all, if we base our business decisions on business analytics,\n> why shouldn\u2019t we make people decisions based on people analytics?\n\n**Q In implementing a suitable analytics model, what challenges do companies\ntend to face?**\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all. Each company is unique and in different stages\nof maturity in its journey. While there are some standard analytics models\nthat I think every company should look at, I do believe that each company must\nevaluate what kind of insights it needs to drive business performance through\nits talent, that is, the kind of talent management problems they have and what\nthe key HR challenges are. The analytics model and framework need to then\nensure they are meeting these needs.\n\nThere are two fundamental challenges that can come your way. First, the\n**availability and accuracy of data**. If we think about the availability of\ndata, we assume that companies have data but, what about the quality of data?\nIf the data going in is poor, incomplete and inaccurate, you cannot expect\ndeep insights to come out of it.\n\nSecond is **technology and the expertise to convert this data into insights**.\nWe have plenty of amazing tools and technology now that allow you to convert\nmassive data sets into easy-to-understand visual tools. Thus, if you don\u2019t\nhave people with expertise in understanding data and technology, it will be a\nstruggle. That is why you see this exponential increase in demand for data\nscientists and engineers, and numerous companies now coming up with analytics\ntools, given the high demand for such tools.\n\n**Q What advice would you give to firms looking to work on their people\nanalytics model?**\n\n**My first advice is to ask yourself this: What exactly am I looking to solve\nthrough the use of people analytics?** There is no point in having a very\nfancy framework that gives 100 amazing visual reports if you don\u2019t know how\nthese reports will solve your business and HR challenges. Companies need to\nlink the business strategy to the HR strategy, identify the issues, and then\nsee what kind of data and insights will help them solve those.\n\n> ##### You cannot solve all problems through data, but you can still get a\n> lot out of it. The analytics approach has to be proactive rather than\n> reactive.\n\nYou also need to **ask the \u2018why\u2019 before you work on the \u2018what\u2019**. Get people\nwho understand data and can help create meaningful insights from the millions\nof data points.\n\nBased on my personal experience, you can look at one data set in a variety of\nways, which allows room for creativity \u2013 this field is not limited by any\nmeans. Ultimately, regardless of what model you choose, it must lead back to\nthe original challenge you are trying to solve.\n\nLast, as this is an evolving field, more technology and tools mean more data\nis created. **You need a framework that allows companies to constantly\nmonitor, adapt and evolve their analytics capability and reach**. What works\nnow will not work in two years\u2019 time, even in how companies are thinking\nthrough their approach and constantly linking their analytics models to solve\nbusiness and people challenges.\n\n* * *\n\n**People, process, and system: ASM\u2019s three pillars to a successful people\nanalytics transformation journey**\n\n**_At the end of the day, transformation is not a big \u2018bang\u2019. It happens bit\nby bit via the small interactions with data and analytics that create the\n\u2018aha\u2019 moments daily, affirms Daniel Kusmanto, the firm\u2019s Global Head, HR\nAnalytics, in this interview with Priya Sunil._**\n\nASM, a supplier of semiconductor process equipment for wafer processing,\nfounded in the Netherlands, believes in the importance of starting right. So\nwhen it started a people analytics team in 2017, the team comprised just one\nfull- time person \u2013 Daniel Kusmanto, the firm\u2019s Global Head, HR Analytics.\nWhy? He explains: \u201cThere are companies that come in with a big bang; you\u2019ll\nsuddenly see in the newspaper they hired a head, and a bunch of analysts. But\nat ASM, we believe people analytics is more like a transformation journey that\ngrows organically. It\u2019s a bit hard when you\u2019ve started off big, and then you\nkeep measuring the ROI. You might even lose the idea of people analytics being\na journey and not a destination. After all, it is always good to travel light\nfor a long journey, right?\u201d\n\nUndoubtedly, it is never easy to start off something that transforms the way\ndecisions about people are made in an organisation. In line with that, he\nhighlights the three key pillars of transformation \u2013 people, process, and\nsystem, emphasising the importance of HR and IT collaborating towards a common\nvision and moving forward as one in the analytics journey. \u201cWithout this\nalignment, it is an uphill battle to make progress.\u201d\n\nOn this journey, people are the hardest to transform. How was this challenge\ntackled? \u201cAs in marketing, we started off by segregating our target population\nand transforming them progressively, starting with the HRBPs who were\nconsidered one of the most important allies and important stakeholders that\ncan bring data and analytics to the discussion table with senior business\nleaders.\u201d\n\n> ##### In encouraging transformation, he believes the team should become more\n> like an evangelist by continually promoting people analytics and recognising\n> opportunities to embed people analytics in decision-making.\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe next equally important segment is the HR leadership team,\nfollowing which, we should move beyond HR to people managers and eventually\nall employees.\u201d In encouraging transformation, he believes the team should\nbecome more like an evangelist by continually promoting people analytics and\nrecognising opportunities to embed people analytics in decision-making.\n\u201cWhenever we\u2019re in the midst of a casual talk or regular meeting with\ncolleagues, they may mention an issue they are facing \u2013 it can be in retaining\ntalent, recruitment or compensation. In these instances, it\u2019s important to\nidentify any opportunity where people analytics can help with. Something where\ndata can give them an insight into what is happening and what they can\npossibly do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, transformation is not a big \u2018bang\u2019. It happens bit by\nbit via the small interactions with data and analytics that create the \u2018aha\u2019\nmoments daily.\u201d Overall, he shares the transformation journey and the growth\nof people analytics at ASM has been \u201cquite successful\u201d and that although ROI\nis yet to be established in dollar-terms, there is still an impact on the\nbusiness. \u201cLooking back at where we started with HR data still scattered and\nnot much opportunities to retrieve insights, to today, where the results of\npeople analytics are being discussed at the highest level in the organisation,\nthus triggering cross- department initiatives \u2013 it is indeed great progress.\u201d\n\nHowever, he is quick to point out the firm is \u201cnot there yet\u201d. In fact, he\nbelieves there are many more uncharted territories in the organisation where\npeople analytics can play a more significant role, such as workforce planning,\norganisational effectiveness, and so on.\n\nMoving forward, he emphasises that people analytics leaders, as disruptors to\nHR\u2019s traditional way of working, are being disrupted as well by ready-made\nanalytics capabilities that come with HR technology platforms.\n\n\u201cHence, we need to move away from transactional analytics towards blending\nbusiness knowledge, HR policy and practice, and data analysis to break down a\ngeneric business question on people (e.g. if we have more headcount, why are\nthe machines still producing the same amount and how can we boost this?) to\nmany granular questions that, in the end, can be answered (perhaps not at 100%\nconfidence and it will be in terms of probability) with people data and\nanalytics.\u201d\n\n> ##### We need to move away from transactional analytics towards blending\n> business knowledge, HR policy and practice, and data analysis to break down\n> a generic business question on people\n\n* * *\n\n**How to create enriching career conversations through data**\n\n**_For Tham Weng Yip, HR Lead, Talent Management and Projects, Brenntag Asia\nPacific, people analytics is about the ability to gather and combine data to\ntell meaningful stories and gain insights about a specific situation and about\npeople. He shares more in this short interview with Priya Sunil._**\n\n**Q What are the typical business needs which drive a firm\u2019s people analytics\nmodel?**\n\nThe needs vary, and include: boosting sales revenue; penetrating a new market;\nstudying customer buying trends; measuring customer satisfaction levels;\nenhancing the current supply chain and distribution network; hiring and\ndeveloping talent; succession planning; career management; reducing staff\nattrition; driving performance and company culture, and engaging a\nmultigenerational workforce.\n\nAt Google, for instance, the firm\u2019s Project Oxygen uses people analytics to\nuncover the practices of its best managers and provides coaching sessions for\nlow performers. While at Dell, analytics is used to increase the success of\nits sales force.\n\nAt the same time, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) uses people analytics to\nidentify the traits of great managers, and leverages that for their\ndevelopment. RBC also uses internal and customer data to diagnose reasons for\nthe performing and non-performing branches, regions or product innovation.\n\nBack home, Singapore is investing in becoming a SMART nation. The key pillars\nto support this are a digital economy, digital government, and digital\nsociety. Our people, our companies and our public agencies all have a role to\nplay in this transformation by becoming a value-creating nation going forward,\nversus a value-adding one.\n\nOverall, it is about the ability to gather and combine data to tell meaningful\nstories and gain insights about a specific situation and about people, while\nallowing you to plan interventions that will solve key organisational\nchallenges and, ultimately, drive business outcomes.\n\n**Q Based on your experience across industries, what key factors form the\nbasis of each industry\u2019s needs?**\n\nPeople make things happen. It is an opportunity to create self-awareness for\nthe organisation and employees around people analytics and what it can do for\nthem, and, in doing so, engage them to play their part. It is also about\nunderstanding and gaining insights, for example, about people\u2019s behaviours,\nforecasting trends and predicting events for better decision-making, to name\nsome.\n\nUnderstanding employees\u2019 stories through data will enrich career\nconversations, by knowing their preferences, values and motivations. This is\nstrategic in developing talent initiatives to achieve organisational goals,\nengaging the hearts and minds of employees, and building that ultimate\nemployee experience that promotes the company brand.\n\n> ##### Understanding employees\u2019 stories through data will enrich career\n> conversations, by knowing their preferences, values and motivations.\n\n**Q In implementing a suitable analytics model, what challenges do companies\ncome across?**\n\nThe first challenge lies in combining accurate and clean data from various\nsystems, in order to mine valuable insights and interpretation of the\nemployee\u2019s behaviour and journey. Another challenge is in ensuring sound\ngovernance around how the data is processed, used and kept with compliance to\nthe local data security and privacy policy.\n\nIn my view, the next challenge is around building understanding and commitment\nto change as part of the communication strategy and change management.\nFinally, the challenge also lies in developing the competencies and skills of\nthe HR professionals and employees who use the data to support decision-\nmaking.\n\n**Q What advice would you give to firms looking to work on their people\nanalytics model?**\n\nFirms intending to embark on this rewarding and exciting journey are advised\nto begin with a road map. Asking the right questions will lead to actionable\ninsights, while setting a vision with clear goals provides clarity of\ndirection about what you want to achieve. Organisations should also be able to\nidentify the support required and assemble the team members who are passionate\nabout analytics.\n\nIn managing the expectations and communicating the need for change, HR is\npresented with an opportunity to diagnose, and build understanding and\ncommitment to change for the organisation. First, begin with one or two key\ninitiatives that will solve key organisational challenges and witness the ROI\nin the journey to get buy-in, and establish credibility in the process.\n\nFurther, firms who wish to revamp their existing people analytics model are\nadvised to look critically at what areas have worked well, what has not, and\nwhat can be stopped. The important takeaways are, overall, the rich lessons\nlearnt as an organisation, as a team and as an individual through the\nexperience. This will provide guidance in the road map for the next phase of\nyour people analytics journey.\n\nWe are living in a data-driven economy. Data is now readily available,\ncomplemented by many tools being developed in the market to boost analytics\ncapabilities and cater to the interest in big data. Progressive companies see\nthe advantage of leveraging people data to make better decisions, managing\npeople at work, and reaping the benefits of implementing a people analytics\nstrategy.\n\n* * *\n\n_This feature was published in[Human Resources Online\u2019s January-February 2020\nedition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of the Singapore\nmagazine and will soon be published in the Q1 edition of the Malaysia\nmagazine.

This includes the\nability to capture clients' social security tax deferral options as well as\nreporting functionality for the Paycheck Protection Program.\n\nPaylocity also deployed new resources to educate organizations on legislative\nchanges and help employers understand and select the right aspects of the new\nlaw for the benefit of their business and employees. The company launched\ntraining sessions on the new legislation in its learning management system and\nhosted a webinar on the CARES Act with over 10,000 attendees. Paylocity also\nlooks forward to hosting a separate webinar on April 1 to discuss the critical\nways Paylocity's product suite is supporting the CARES Act and FFCRA.\n\nThe use of Community, the company's tool for improving and maintaining\nemployee engagement and communication, has more than doubled over the past\nthree weeks. Other products proving to be highly useful include Mobile,\nLearning Management System (LMS), and Surveys, all of which allow leaders to\nquickly deploy information to employees and keep them engaged.\n\nPaylocity also rolled out its Emergency Setup Dashboard to keep employees\ninformed, productive and healthy during the pandemic. Employees can use the\ndashboard to ensure employees' contact information is updated for\ncommunications, share important policy changes about remote work in light of\nsocial distancing recommendations and set up direct deposit for payroll.\n\n\"During this unprecedented time, Paylocity remains committed to our mission of\ndeeply caring for our clients and moving forward together, especially when the\nfuture of work and legislation is changing every day,\" said Steve Beauchamp,\nCEO of Paylocity. \"In addition to providing COVID-19 facts and resources,\ncommunication templates and tips on using Paylocity's solutions during this\ntime, we've also quickly enhanced our product suite to help our clients easily\ntake action on the new laws.\"\n\n**HR News:**[Capacity's New

program](https://www.bicmagazine.com/departments/hr/how-to-\nmeasure-the-roi-of-your-training-program/)\n\n# How to measure the ROI of your training program\n\nby [David Stark](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/david-stark/)\n\nApril 3, 2020\n\n9:20 AM\n\n[Back to Search Results]()\n\n[RSS](https://www.bicmagazine.com/departments/hr/index.rss)\n\nPrint\n\nIt's been said that if you don't have a goal, you'll reach it every time. When\nit comes to your training program, the focus is on employee education and\ndevelopment. However, the end goal for your business is to achieve a\nprofitable bottom line on your budget spreadsheet.\n\n![training.jpg](https://www.bicmagazine.com/downloads/12914/download/training.jpg?cb=dec26c3724014fc59d2f5beaabf05cf9)\n\nSome aspects of employee training and development will provide more idealistic\noutcomes that are practically impossible to measure. With an effective\ntraining system, you might discover that your employees perform better as a\nteam. They might be happier in their jobs and, thus, more loyal for the long\nhaul. Of course, teamwork and satisfied employees are advantageous, but they\nare not straightforward standards to measure your return on investment (ROI).\n\nThe ability to measure ROI in any business venture is vital. Here are four\nways your training program can produce returns for your employees' development\nand, ultimately, for your end goal.\n\n**Collecting data**\n\nTo measure your training program's ROI, you need to know how much time your\nemployees are spending on training. How many modules have they completed (or\nnot completed)? Are they engaging with the curriculum? Sure, your training\ndepartment can do the recordkeeping; however, consider that a computer-based\ntraining software, such as a learning management system (LMS), can easily\ncapture and track all of your data, eliminating data management issues and\nproviding quick access to current data reports.\n\n**Considering the costs**\n\nWill executing and maintaining a training program provide a desirable return?\nIs it more cost-effective to outsource your program or host it in-house? These\nare just a couple of the questions your management team will need to discuss\nwhen considering what your employee development system costs and how much you\nare willing to invest. Unless you have a highly skilled team in your training\ndepartment, taking advantage of a qualified e-learning provider is a training\nroute worth pursuing. A reliable program might include upfront costs, but the\nbenefits of its efficiency and effectiveness will pay off.\n\n**Tracking training results**\n\nBalancing the bottom line by monitoring performance, productivity and safety\nrecords will offer an undeniable measuring tool as you calculate your ROI.\nTracking the costs involved will allow you to measure your results based on\nwhat you've invested and what you gain.\n\n**Saving money**\n\nOne factor in forecasting your ROI is determining what you will save as a\nresult of investing in your training program. Saving payable work hours by\noutsourcing your training program is one way to measure the monetary value of\nyour return. You may also notice that due to longevity among your employees,\nlimiting how many employees you train will decrease your future training\ncosts. Perhaps, though, the most valuable elements in regard to monetary\nsavings are maintaining compliance and avoiding safety and legal risks.\n\nROI calculations are how you measure the monetary benefit of your investment.\nThe standard formula for computing your ROI for training is: ROI (percentage)\n= ((monetary benefits \u00e2 training costs)/ training costs) x 100. ROI may also\nbe measured in terms of decreased per-item product cost or time.\n\nThere are several paths a company can take when deciding on an employee\ntraining plan. Which approach you choose to implement is a matter of\nconviction, what your company is comfortable with and where your management\nteam finds value. Some paths, however, may not contribute to measuring the\ndistinct monetary benefits of your curriculum.\n\nWhether through increased revenue or decreased product cost and time, an LMS\nis a worthwhile and measurable investment to consider that will increase the\nmonetary return of your training program.\n\n**For more information, visit www.overnitecbt.com or call (888) 228-2473.**\n\n#### Tags\n\n[Training & Human Resources](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/tag-training-\nhuman-resources/) [BIC Alliance\nMember](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/tag-company-review/) [Inside\nIndustry](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/inside-industry/) [Current\nIssue](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/current-issue/) [OverNite Software\nInc.](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/overnite-software-inc./)\n\nby [David Stark](https://www.bicmagazine.com/topics/david-stark/)\n\nApril 3, 2020\n\n9:20 AM\n\n[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BICMagazine1/)\n[twitter](https://twitter.com/bicmagazine)\n[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCIzppnXMoyKq1EqgfycklQ)\n[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/24772832/)\n[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bic_magazine/)\n\n![](//bicalliance.img-\nus3.com/admin/bicmagazine_logo_spot_2.png?r=0.5133610582347545)\n\nEmail*\n\nFirst Name*\n\nLast Name*\n\nCompany*\n\nBIC Magazine Newsletters*\n\nIndustry Report Weekly Enewsletter\n\nResources Monthly Enewsletter\n\nBIC & Industry Events\n\nPlease verify your request*\n\nSubscribe\n\n![](https://design1-wc.metropublisher.net/downloads/11118/download/BIC-white-\nlogo.svg)\n\nConnecting people in business and industry with one another for the betterment\nof all.

With growing\nneed from clients, Paylocity saw an opportunity to \"expand the relationship\"\nby acquiring VidGrid, the press release stated.\n\nUsing videos will become more and more important for businesses as the\ndefinition of work expands, including more remote positions and other such\nchanges to the traditional office sphere. Thus, VidGrid was a choice to help\nPaylocity better respond to its customers, the press release stated.\n\nPaylocity CEO Steve Beauchamp said the implementation of videos would be\ncrucial as the world evolves. He said VidGrid shared Paylocity's dedication to\ndoing good work for clients.\n\nNick Stokman, co-founder and CEO of VidGrid, said he wants to help foster\nbetter communication everywhere and looks forward to the future of the two\ncompanies now intertwined.\n\nPaylocity has been doing its best to keep up with the times in terms of\npayments and has recently rolled out an [on-demand\npayment](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/paylocity-gig-economy-\npayroll-wage/) service which the company said will help people get paid\nfaster, without the sometimes cumbersome and slow once- or twice-a-month pay\ncycles that used to be the norm.\n\nBeauchamp said many young people are used to gig economy jobs that paid\nfaster, and, upon being told they'd only be paid a few times a month, found\nthat incompatible with their lifestyles.\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

Let\u2019s take a look at the five key trends that the **[Learning\nManagement System (LMS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/what-is-a-learning-management-system-lms/) **space is witnessing\nand will continue to develop this year, what these trends mean for\norganizations and their employees and how these would shape the future of\nwork.\n\n### **1\\. The Rise of Multi-channel Learning**\n\n  \nWith millennials quickly becoming the predominant generational demographic at\nthe workplace, organizations need to prepare for a workforce that is not only\ntech-savvy but also tech-dependent. There is also a clearly observable shift\nin terms of the applicability of learning and training. Multi-channel learning\nallows not only access to anytime-anywhere learning but also faster\napplication of skills learned or upgraded.\n\nChanges in the format and processes of LMS mean that organizations need to pay\ncloser heed to the needs of employees in the context of business needs. When\nit comes to upgrading [**learning and development**\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\nlearning-and-development-objectives-strategy/)frameworks, **Skip Marshall, HCM\nTechnology Executive at DXC Technology** believes that it is essential to\nclearly communicate the immense value of upgrading L&D; frameworks and in\nthat, organizations face challenges in three core aspects:\n\n**Strategic planning** \u2013 Organizations need to start with business objectives\nin mind\n\n**Breaking down silos** \u2013 All business stakeholders must be vested and believe\nin the solution\n\n**Undergoing change management** \u2013 Change is an inevitable part of the\nbusiness. It is important to view the speed of change as an opportunity to\ntransition to more user-friendly, flexible and inclusive learning systems.\nObtain and achieve key business stakeholder support across business groups, to\nhelp drive the solution.\n\nWith the evolving format of learning, it is wise to bear in mind that the\ncontent that needs to be curated for multi-channel learning needs to be\nadapted to the changing expectations of learners on these channels. Snackable,\npage-turner content is what works best in today\u2019s fast-paced work ecosystem\nwith a seemingly diminishing attention span.\n\n### **2\\. From LMS to LXP**\n\n  \nSkip is of the opinion that the \u201cdriver for both employees and management in\nshifting from traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS) to Learning\nExperience Platforms (LXPs) is the shift toward learning curation and engaging\ncontent, which has driven the industry to develop solutions and platforms that\ncan provide engaging learning experiences.\u201d\n\nLearning has evolved to focus on how such experiences can not only make\nlearning more engaging but also drive actionable knowledge that directly ties\nto the learner/worker and business performance. With this, there has naturally\nbeen a significant shift from prescriptive learning to subscription learning,\nfrom a top-down approach to learning to an essentially learner-driven model.\n\n**Shelley Osborne, Head of Learning and Development at Udemy,** points out\nthat, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing pervasive changes throughout the workforce with new\ntechnologies and increased automation impacting more and more jobs. Skills are\nthe new currency of the global economy and we all need to be in a state of\ncontinuous learning to keep up. As we\u2019re witnessing demand for online learning\nfrom organizations around the world, it\u2019s clear that the training and learning\nsolutions of the past aren\u2019t going to be what propels us into the future.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of LXPs is their platform fluidity and this ties\nin with the trend of multi-channel content. Moreover, with improved technology\nand connectivity, experts who were once unreachable are now available on-\ndemand and can create value for employees/learners.\n\nThat is where the learner experience features in the puzzle. Organizations\nneed to learn to help their employees learn better.\n\n### **3\\. A Personalized Learning Experience**\n\n  \nAn important benefit that LXPs provide is the operational value to the\norganization with micro-level reporting and the opportunity for deep\nanalytics, creating meaningful impact for both the learner and the\norganization. Additionally, LXPs provide learners with a collaborative, self-\ndriven journey that is engaging and well-circulated among peers and fellow\nlearners. Skip also rightly mentions that, \u201cToday\u2019s learners want learning\nthat is available on the go, modality agnostic and quick to consume.\u201d\n\nOrganizations are thus in the race to provide a more inclusive approach that\nis personalized, aligns with specific learning styles and incorporates micro-\nlevel reporting, deep analytics, quality content curation, peer sharing, and\ncommunity building. This is where speed and relevancy provide the best value\nfor all stakeholders. Learners, whether millennials or otherwise, are used to\na world where all communication is personalized. Learning content needs to\nspeak to them individually as well.\n\nShelley states that \u201cIn the era of Netflix and Amazon where every interaction\nis individually personalized, employees have consumer-grade expectations, and\nlearning is no exception to that.\u201d She sites the Udemy 2017 Workplace Stress\nstudy, that found that 46% of employees say they want learning that\u2019s\npersonalized to their needs. Long gone are the days of cookie-cutter, static\ncorporate trainings! Because every learning journey is different, it\u2019s\ncritical for organizations to have the ability to provide customized learning\nexperiences for every employee based on the challenges they face in their\nrole, their career aspirations, and their personal preferences.\n\nBy viewing technology as an enabler, Skip says organizations can benefit from\ninnovation in the eLearning space including advances in cloud computing, which\nhas made it easier to manage change with speed and dependability while also\nallowing the organization to add relevant personalization. Incorporating\nemployee recognition programs that reflect the organization\u2019s core values and\nmotivate learners to become more self-driven and serve as valuable coaches to\nothers is a great way to encourage learners on their individualized learning\njourneys.\n\n### **4\\. Mapping the ROI of Learning**\n\n  \nWhat once could have been dismissed as castles in the air and would have been\nan ordeal to get managerial buy-in for is now tangible, measurable and\ntransparent \u2013 the return of investment on LMS and other L&D; endeavors.\n\n**Hawley Kane** , **Head of Organizational Talent and Leadership Development,\nSaba Software** feels that, \u201cHands down we see the connection of learning to\nperformance as being the a-ha moment for L&D.; Here\u2019s the crux of it: For\nhigh-performing organizations, learning is not the outcome - it is the\nbehavior that drives performance. Learning and performance management do not\nmerely co-exist - they are dependent on one another.\u201d\n\nHawley adds that to deliver learning experiences that move the needle on\nperformance, talent leaders need to empower employees to drive their own\ndevelopment with learning that is aligned to individual, team and business\ngoals. By thinking in terms of business outcomes and focusing L&D; programs on\nspecific behaviors, skills, or competencies, you can solidify the learning-\nperformance connection to achieve the results that matter to your business.\n\n\u201cParticular trends that are generating a lot of client interest right now are\nthe focus on measuring the business/operational impact of learning and the\nparallel trend of Learning Experience Platforms (LXPs) and learning systems\nintegration,\u201d says **Geoffrey Bloom, Principal Consultant at LEO Learning.**\nHe adds that the combination of these trends facilitates a much deeper\nunderstanding of what training is working (and why!) and can create a much\nmore personalized learning experience too. Identifying what works and what is\nvalued also has the potential benefits of increasing quality and relevance and\nreducing waste while keeping the ROI in mind.\n\nWith technology moving the needle on the evolution of learning systems and\ne-learning thriving, organizations now have easier access to learners\u2019\nprogress, data on learning behavior as well as a deeper understanding of the\n(often real-time) impact of learning on business performance.\n\n**Learn More:** **[A Career in Learning and Development: 10 Must-Have Skills\nto Make It Big in 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/skills-for-a-career-in-learning-and-development/)**\n\n### **5\\. A Range of Choices**\n\n  \nA key trend for the year ahead seems to be the sheer boom of new and upgraded\nLMS solutions. What should companies keep in mind when choosing the \"right\"\neLearning solution?\n\n\u201cWhen evaluating a learning solution, it\u2019s really important for companies to\nassess what the business objectives are that they\u2019re aiming to impact\u201d, says\nShelley. She adds that by evaluating what is happening within the business and\nidentifying opportunities for improvement, implementing the right learning\ninitiatives will not only satisfy employees but can also impact the bottom\nline. There are many high-growth organizations that require content on\nfreshest tools and technology to stay competitive. Finding the right solution\nin our dynamic marketplace is thus the key to upskill and reskill quickly.\n\nWith multiple LMS offerings providing thousands of real-world experts and\nfresh content, organizations need to be able to choose wisely. Having the\nwrong LMS could prove to be costlier than not having one at all.\n\n## **Learning to Learn**\n\nAccording to a recent report by Deloitte, the half-life of skills has\ndecreased to only about five years. Shelley makes the case for reinventing our\nskills by pointing out that in a career lifespan of about 50 years, with the\nlife span of skills dipping low, we will need to reinvent ourselves about 10\ntimes. For example, if you think about something as broad as the marketing\nindustry, the skills required today look nothing like what was necessary 10 or\neven five years ago. The rate at which technology has impacted every industry\nhas made it critical for employees to constantly be ready to adapt and learn\nthe newest skillset. How can organizations enable that? Well, the difference\nbetween a successful training program and one that fizzles out, is often the\nstakeholder buy-in. While curating the right learning module and content is\nimportant, it is also imperative to create a culture of learning where\nlearning is normalized in the workplace and all stakeholders are empowered to\nlead change.\n\n**_What are key trends in LMS that you foresee?

It aimed to bridge the\ngap between school-level education and workplace requirements.\n\nDepending on the median educational qualification available in your region,\nand the day-to-day requirements of work, the definition of human resource\ndevelopment can vary widely.\n\nFor example, a plan to amplify people's potential for a startup in Silicon\nValley will look very different from a human resource development program\ndesigned for a large factory in China.\n\nIn the early days, HRD would involve rigorous hands-on training focused on the\nacquisition of hard skills. Today, the picture is different.\n\nThe skills profile of top-tier talent is highly layered, comprising a mix of\nhard and soft skills. HR must pay equal attention to these areas of human\nresource development to bring out an employee's full potential.\n\nIn addition, strategies to improve culture and build a work environment\nconducive to upskilling and self-development also come under HRD. A data-\ndriven mindset might also prove useful, allowing HR to measure learning\nperformance and dynamically update performance benchmarks.\n\nFor these reasons, we recommend an agile approach when defining human resource\ndevelopment for your company, keeping in mind your organization's unique needs\nand its potential to grow.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What Is Learning and Development (L &D;)? Definition,\nObjectives, and Best Practices for\nStrategy**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-\nis-learning-and-development-objectives-strategy/)\n\n## **5 Key Functions of Human Resource Development**\n\nThere are five formal human resource development functions in an HR\ndepartment:\n\n### **1\\. Strategic talent sourcing and acquisition**\n\n  \nThe first step to enhancing your human capital is to spot and onboard the\nright talent. The best candidates may not always have the most experience or\nthe highest number of qualifications. However, they can be good culture adds\nto your organization.\n\nA careful mix of soft skills, personality, and potential will determine\n**[talent sourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-sourcing/)** , and in turn, the effectiveness of\nhuman resource development.\n\nRight from the\n[**onboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) stage, HR begins to equip the\nemployee with the knowledge required to succeed during the employee's tenure\nin the organization.\n\n### **2\\. Education-oriented employee benefits**\n\n  \nA benefits package focused on human resource development will include\nsponsorships for adult education, assistance for tuition fees, flexible hours\nfor those continuing their learning outside of college, and so on.\n\nFor example, the Starbucks College Achievement Plan provides U.S. employees\nwith tuition coverage for specific universities and degrees. DHL offers a\nsimilar benefit in the form of tuition reimbursement for employees applying\nfor online college degrees.\n\n![The functions of human resource development](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. The functions of human resource development**\n\n### **3\\. Performance measurement and management**\n\n  \nPerformance management is at the heart of human resource development.\nEmployees may not always be able to take time out for learning sessions and\nonline courses, which is where a strength-focused [**performance management**\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-hcm/what-is-\nperformance-management/)model kicks in.\n\nManagers regularly review employee performance and share inspiring/coaching\nfeedback. Employees then focus on improving performance, incrementally\nimproving their capabilities. Such a structure requires agility to prove\nuseful.\n\n### **4\\. Formal learning and development programs**\n\n  \nTo complement managers' efforts, you can offer learning and development\nsessions to close specific skills gaps. This must factor in company needs on\nthe one hand and the employee's personal ambitions on the other.\n\nLet's say an employee with leadership potential is interested in the marketing\ndomain. You can assign a learning track that develops both these skill sets\nand gradually helps the employee transition into the marketing department\nwhere they can learn the ropes before taking on that leadership role.\n\n### **5\\. Internal mobility and succession planning**\n\n  \nAn effective human resource development program will ensure that every\nemployee finds the best-fit job within the organization, in sync with their\ndesires and capabilities.\n\nInternal mobility supports lateral transitions, while a succession plan\nfocuses on developing future leaders. Once again, internal mobility and\nsuccession planning must be supported by hard and soft skills training,\nrespectively.\n\nInterestingly, HRD also takes place informally. Unstructured interactions such\nas informal mentorships and on-the-job collaboration can go a long way in\nstrengthening employee capabilities. However, having a structured, measurable\nprogram in place is essential to the success of a human resource development\nprogram.\n\n## **How to Start a Human Resource Development Program**\n\nThe many functions of human resource development require several stakeholders\nfrom outside the HR department. That's why launching the program could seem\nlike an effort- and time-intensive task.\n\nHere is a quick breakdown of steps that could streamline the process:\n\n### **1\\. Assess internal and external talent potential**\n\n  \nTake stock of your existing workforce and the available talent pool in your\ndomain and region. Estimate hiring timelines for expanding the workforce and\nlaunching the program. To do this, you can use **[HR\nanalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-hr-\nanalytics/)**. Based on the data the analytics engine has, it can identify the\npotential of each employee and help you develop training programs accordingly.\n\n### **2\\. Map human resource training and development objectives**\n\n  \nMake sure to include both near- and long-term objectives in this step. These\nobjectives could range from upskilling for a project that must be closed in\none month to making your workforce more resilient to ongoing digital\ntransformation. Collaborate with the different stakeholders needed to create\nthis employee career development program \u2013 for instance, department heads and\nteam leaders.\n\n### **3\\. Identify the resources need for training and development**\n\n  \nWhat are the tools, resources, time, and external assistance you need to meet\nthe objectives mapped out in the previous step? Carefully outline these\nprocesses to build a sequential strategy that clearly defines the expected\noutcomes.\n\n### **4\\. Speak to stakeholders and obtain buy-in**\n\n  \nThis could include buy-in from the CEO for high-level business targets, from\nthe CIO for digital tools and implementation, from the CFO for budget\napproval, the CHRO to hire external consultants if required, and the like.\n\n### **5\\. Communicate with on-ground execution managers**\n\n  \nThe program will be primarily executed by team leaders, business unit heads,\nand learning practitioners. Conduct workshops with these individuals\nbeforehand to convey the intended objectives of learning and the approach that\nwill be adopted. Ensure that you adapt the plan based on feedback.\n\n### **6\\. Launch the program and review it at regular intervals** :\n\n  \nAfter a specific interval (a robust HRD program will take time to show\ntangible results), conduct an evaluation.\n\n  * What are the program's strengths and weaknesses?\n  * Is the cost-to-benefit ratio in your favor?\n  * Should the plan have a wider deployment?\n\n  \nReview these parameters and relaunch the program after accommodating this\nfeedback.\n\nThese are some of the foundational steps to start a human resource development\nprogram, no matter what your intended vision might be. Let's now look at a set\nof best practices that can help HR across industries to develop their human\ncapital better.\n\n## **8** **Best Practices for Human Resource Training and Development**\n\nThere are several ways to make sure that your human resource training and\ndevelopment strategy hits the mark.\n\nWe specifically mention the training here because on-the-job training is\npivotal to developing employee capabilities in nearly every field. Whether you\nrun a manufacturing plant or supervise an educational institution, whether\nyour company makes softballs or software platforms, the workforce must be\nadequately trained to produce the expected output.\n\nTo achieve this, follow these best practices:\n\n### **1\\. Assign human resource development owners**\n\n  \nThe best strategies can fall flat if there is no ownership for execution.\nThat's why companies must set specific key performance indicators (KPIs) for\ntraining, development, and performance, with process owners who are tasked\nwith improving these metrics. These individuals may be L&D; practitioners in\nthe organization, team leaders, line managers, and the like.\n\n### **2\\. Contain attrition among trained workers by focusing on engagement**\n\n  \nHuman resource training and development involves significant investment per\nemployee, which becomes redundant when a highly trained resource leaves the\norganization. This is where focusing on ancillary HR functions such as\n**[employee engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-engagement/)** , recognition, and culture-building\ncan help prevent **[employee\nattrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-attrition-complete-guide/)**.\n\n### **3\\. Use rewards and recognition to incentivize learning**\n\n  \nRecognition is closely linked with **[employee\nretention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/)** and therefore helps to\ncontain attrition in your workforce. Rewards for course completion and\nsuperior performance can also motivate employees further.\n\n### **4\\. Coordinate pan-organizational development**\n\n  \nTraining and development tracks in different departments/business units should\nnot be planned independently of each other. A centralized approach that keeps\nin mind the progress each department is making can enable the HRD program to\nmeet the company's shared vision and purpose.\n\n### **5\\. Link career progression to development**\n\n  \nCareer progression shouldn't entirely depend on the length of an employee's\ntenure. After training and development sessions, if an employee is seen to be\nan exceptional performer, you can develop a personalized career progression\ntrack for them.\n\n### **6\\. Initiate human resource training and development from day 1**\n\n  \nYou can work together with the recruitment team to embed training into the\n**[onboarding experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/)**. This will give\nnew employees an understanding of your continuous learning culture, making\nlater-stage training much easier.\n\n### **7\\. Avoid a cookie-cutter training and development journey**\n\n  \nOne of the most significant transformations in human resource development is\nthe emerging need for personalization. Today, employees are aware of their\nunique capabilities, which demand personalized and adaptive learning\nmethodologies. Here's where corporate eLearning software can help.\n\n### **8\\. Make the development transferable**\n\n  \nA formal human resource development program should offer certifications,\nmicro-credentials, and even digital badges upon completion. These achievements\nare transferable to other jobs outside the organization and can encourage\nemployees to fast-track the learning process.\n\nThese are some of the best practices that can strengthen your human resource\ndevelopment strategy and make your training initiatives genuinely stick.\n\n## **4 Software Tools to Support Your Human Resource Development Program**\n\nThe HR technology landscape is continuously growing, including learning and\ndevelopment tech. Several of these tools can prove useful to develop a\ncompany's employee potential. So, consider the following platforms when\noutlining your HRD strategy for 2020:\n\n### **1\\. A job shadow enablement software like Grandshake**\n\n  \nNearly 70% of all learning happens via on-the-job experiences. That's why job\nshadowing and apprenticeship have traditionally been integral to human\nresource development.\n\nNow, platforms like Grandshake are taking it one step further.\n\nYou can connect with local schools and educational organizations, you can\nengage with the \"shadowee\" and screen applications through video resumes, and\nyou can improve performance through the in-platform feedback loop.\n\n### **2\\. A workforce analytics platform like** **Cognisess**\n\n  \nWorkforce analytics can reveal valuable insights into your human resource\npotential, future possibilities, and next-best actions to boost performance.\nAnalytics is now critical for human resource development programs, which is\nwhy solutions like Cognisess have rapidly gained traction.\n\nCognisess Pro is a predictive people analytics platform that has 50+\nassessments to measure 120+ performance attributes. It uses AI to bypass the\nrisk of bias/subjectivity, maximizing the value of your people assets.\n\n### **3\\. A career pathing and internal mobility tool like** **Paddle**\n\n  \nIn a large workforce, hidden employee potential can go unnoticed. Your human\nresource development program should be able to tap into such capabilities to\noptimize resource utilization in your company. A tool like Paddle can match\nemployees with the right role, improving overall productivity.\n\nPaddle is an AI-powered tool for career pathing and internal mobility\nstreamlining. It has a repository of learning materials to support\ntransitions. The tool's AI can analyze employee skill sets and career\nhistories to recommend the most suitable career path.\n\n### **4\\. A multi-device e-learning authoring solution like** **Gomo**\n\n  \nYour e-learning platform must combine multi-device delivery for convenient,\npersonalized learning experiences with advanced analytics on employee\nprogress. Gomo has two modules: Authoring for e-learning content generation\nand Delivery & Analytics to track consumption on multiple devices.\n\nGomo is a no-installation SaaS product that's easy to use, reducing the time-\nto-value from your human resource development program. It is used by the likes\nof Vodafone, Sony, and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n## **Looking Forward: Which Areas of Human Resource Development Demand\nAttention in 2020?**\n\nThe definition of human resource development concept covers a broad spectrum.\n\nWith so many areas and functions to address, it can be challenging to\nprioritize those that demand the most attention. Fortunately, predictive\nanalytics tools can highlight which organization-specific areas of human\nresource development should rank the highest on your checklist for every\nquarter/year.\n\nApart from this, it is a good idea to keep an eye on the latest HR trends and\nmap your HRD program to global benchmarks to gain a competitive advantage.\n\nFor 2020, we recommend a keen focus on the following areas:\n\n  * **Shedding legacy practices:** Three out of five HR leaders fear irrelevance in 2020 if the HR function doesn't embrace modernization, as per KPMG's [survey](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/11/the-future-of-human-resources-2020.html) of 1,300 HR leaders.\n  * **Establishing a culture framework:** 61% of respondents in the survey we cited are in the process of changing their culture.

But are we taking advantage of top HR\ntech tools? Especially in a crisis like this, we may be missing out on\nopportunities to not only increase the efficiency and accuracy of your HR\nfunction but also enhance employee engagement.\n\nHR tools can help you increase the productivity of the employees and help your\nbusiness function smoothly.\n\nHere are the tools which you can consider:\n\n **Make Sure Your Employees Get Recognized**\n\nEmployee engagement has emerged as a critical driver for success of businesses\ntoday. A lot of organizations are recognizing their employees who are going\nabove and beyond to contribute to these challenging times. Induce a sense of\nbelongingness, closeness and friendliness within your organization.\n\n **Employees Are Marked For Their Hard Work**\n\nGeo-fencing mobile-based punch-in/punch-out will make sure that your\nattendance is marked for the day you have worked on and gets you digitally\nconnected workforce. Geo-fencing lets you better collaborate and manage work\nfrom home for employees while enabling businesses to ensure performance and\nproductivity.\n\n **Keep Your Employees In the Loop**\n\nEducate your employees on dos and don'ts by announcing updates on your company\nannouncement forums or internal communication channels. Connect seamlessly\nwith everyone irrespective of any location or time and keep them up to date to\nquell rumors amid COVID-19.\n\n **Make Sure Employees Get Paid on Time**\n\nDuring this difficult hour and overall lockdown situations, while all your\nemployees are putting their best in this situation, organizations should think\nof making life slightly easier for them by processing their salaries on time.\nMake sure your employees are paid on time with faster processing and assured\naccuracy.\n\n **Upskill Yourself and Make the Most Of the Lockdown Period**\n\nKeep training and keep learning until you get it right. Learning can never go\nwaste and you can certainly use tools such as learning management system to\nstudy new courses, learn new domains and expand your array. With learning\nmanagement systems, you can ensure contactless knowledge and information\ndissemination with mobile-based learning.

regional HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\nIn a [speech](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/speeches/2020/0407-speech-by-\nmos-zaqy-at-supplementary-budget-debate-2020) at the Supplementary Budget\nDebate held yesterday (7 April), Singapore's Minister of State for Manpower\nZaqy Mohamad touched on a few areas in which the Government is aiding more\n'vulnerable' groups of workers in Singapore, in light of COVID-19.\n\nThe key points are highlighted below.\n\n**Support for Self-employed Persons : SIRS and Training Support Scheme**\n\nThe first, he shared, was in **supporting self-employed persons (SEPs) through\nthe new SEP Income Relief Scheme (SIRS)** , announced as part of the\n[Resilience Budget](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/singapores-s48bn-\ncovid-19-resilience-budget-key-takeaways-for-hr-and-employers/) and the\n[Solidarity Budget](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/all-hr-needs-to-know-\nabout-singapores-solidarity-budget/).\n\nAll eligible Singaporean SEPs will receive direct cash assistance, through\nthree quarterly cash payouts of S$3,000 each, amounting to S$9,000 in total.\nAbout 100,000 SEPs are expected to automatically benefit from this, the\nMinistry of Manpower (MOM) [announced](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-\nreleases/2020/0406-about-100000-expected-to-automatically-benefit-from-\nenhanced-sirs) on Monday (6 April).\n\nExplaining this, Minister Zaqy said: \"SIRS will provide cash assistance to\nSEPs most in need quickly. We want the cash assistance to reach our SEPs fast.\nSo, we used Workfare criteria as a starting point, and further expanded the\ncriteria to cover almost double the number of SEPs as Workfare.\n\n\"Hence, there is no need for most eligible SEPs to apply.\" Eligible SEPs aged\n37 and above, who have declared a positive net trade income to the Inland\nRevenue Authority of Singapore or the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board for\n2019 will automatically be notified via a letter and SMS in end-May 2020; The\nfirst payout will be in end-May as well, then in July and October.\n\nMinister Zaqy also noted the concerns of some who may not automatically\nqualify, i.e. SEPs aged 21 to 36 in 2020 but who otherwise meet the criteria,\nor those who have spouses earning a high income but have many people at home\nto support.\n\n\"My colleagues and I will try our best to consider the applications of those\nwho did not qualify automatically, particularly those aged 21 to 36 in 2020\nbut otherwise meet the criteria. We will also seriously consider the appeals\nof those who narrowly missed the eligibility criteria.\"\n\nThe MOM will also work with the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) to\nprovide details on how to apply or appeal for the SIRS criteria, he added.\n\nOn top of the above, the Ministry [will enhance the\nSIRS](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-\nreleases/2020/0406-about-100000-expected-to-automatically-benefit-from-\nenhanced-sirs) as part of the Solidarity Budget, as follows:\n\n  * The SIRS will be extended to automatically include SEPs who also earn an income of no more than S$2,300 per month from employment work; and\n  * The Annual Value (AV) of property threshold will be raised from S$13,000 to up to S$21,000. This will include those who live in some condominiums and other private properties.\n\n**Criteria for the enhanced eligibility (Singaporean SEPs)**\n\n  * The SEP should have started work as an SEP on or before 25 March 2020;\n  * The SEP should currently earn a Net Trade Income of not more than S$100,000;\n  * If the SEP also has employment (i.e. dual status worker), the income earned as an employee must be not more than S$2,300/month;\n  * The SEP must be living in a property with an AV not more than S$21,000; and\n  * They must not be owning two or more properties.\n  * For those who are married, the individual and spouse together should not own two or more properties, and the assessable income of the spouse should not exceed S$70,000.\n\nApart from the SIRS, SEPs may also benefit from an **extension to the SEP\nTraining Support Scheme (STSS)** , to take this downturn as an opportunity to\nupskill themselves for the coming upturn, Minister Zaqy stated.\n\nWhen initially announced at last month's Committee of Supply Debate, SEPs who\ntake up any courses under the SkillsFuture Series and other selected training\nprogrammes can receive an hourly training allowance of S$7.50 which will help\ndefray their daily expenses.\n\nThis was applicable for a period of three months and on top of the course fee\nsubsidies of up to 90%.\n\nNow, the STSS has been extended until the end of this year, and the training\nallowance will also be increased to S$10 per hour from 1 May 2020, with no cap\non how much training SEPs can sign up for.\n\n\"For example, a self-employed private hire car or bus driver who spends 10\nfull days of training in a month can receive S$800 of training allowance in\nthat month,\" Minister Zaqy explained.\n\n\"The STSS is administered by NTUC\u2019s e2i. Applications have already started\nsince 1 April 2020. SEPs can refer to NTUC\u2019s website for more details. We\nencourage all SEPs to tap on this training support.\"\n\n**Support for lower-wage workers: Enhanced Workfare Special Payment, Workfare\nIncome Supplement Scheme**\n\nAt the [Budget 2020 reading in\nFebruary](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/singapore-budget-2020-key-\ntakeaways-for-hr-leaders-and-employers/), the Government had announced a\nWorkfare Special Payment (WSP) to be given out to lower-wage workers (earning\nup to S$2,000 a month) on Workfare, wherein they would receive an additional\n20% of their Workfare payout for work done in 2019, with a minimum payment of\nS$100.\n\nThrough the **enhanced WSP, eligible recipients will receive a payment of\nS$3,000 each** , in cash, in July and October (at S$1,500 a month); eligible\nrecipients will be notified and paid automatically by the CPF Board, and there\nis no need to apply.\n\nIn similar efforts, **lower-wage workers will continue to receive additional\nsupport through the enhanced Workfare Income Supplement**.\n\nOn this, Minister Zaqy stressed that more workers can benefit from greater\nWorkfare support, of up to S$4,000 a year.\n\nLast, Minister Zaqy added that from 1 April this year, the government has\n**increased the support from the Short-Term Relief fund, from up to one\nmonth\u2019s salary, capped at S$1,000 today, to up to two months\u2019 salary, capped\nat S$4,600** , depending on the worker\u2019s income. The fund's coverage has now\nbeen extended to cover half the workforce, beyond just lower-wage workers.\n\n* * *\n\n**Enhancements to MOM 's Work-Life Grant for eligible companies**\n\nIn a separate speech at the debate, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for\nManpower Low Yen Ling highlighted that enhancements will also be made to the\nMinistry's Work-Life Grant (WLG) for companies.\n\nCurrently, companies are able to receive S$2,000 for every worker who adopts a\nflexible work arrangement. However, with the circuit breaker measures in\nplace, the Ministry will make it easier for employers to receive support in\nimplementing telecommuting and staggered hours, she shared.\n\n\"MOM will **enhance the WLG parameters by reducing the requirement for firms\nto have their workers telecommute and be on staggered hours \u2013 from a minimum\nperiod of six months to just one month**.\n\n\"The enhanced WLG parameters will apply after the mandatory circuit breaker\nperiod comes to an end, and the grant will be open for application on 20\nApril.\"\n\nMinister Low added that the government \"strongly\" encourages more companies to\napply for this, which provides funding for the purchase of laptops, software\nand related equipment for telecommuting.\n\nMoreover, in preparing for the future, she noted that companies that are\npositioning themselves for the upturn should plan ahead to ensure they equip\ntheir workers with relevant skillsets after the temporary closure of\nworkplaces comes to an end.\n\nThis, she shared, can be done by tapping on the enhanced support for\nredeployment programmes under the Adapt and Grow initiative, to reskill their\nexisting workers.\n\nShe added: \"MOM has extended the funding period and introduced new\nredeployment programmes for the tourism, aviation, retail and food services\nsector. More than 100 firms have already applied, with more than 2,600 workers\nexpected to benefit from this move.\"\n\n* * *\n\n**Two Singaporeans charged for breaching stay-home notice requirements**\n\nOn the topic of COVID-19, **two Singaporeans were charged in court yesterday\n(7 April) for breaching their stay-home notice (SHN)** , the Ministry of\nHealth [announced in a press release](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-\nhighlights/details/two-singapore-citizens-charged-after-breaching-stay-home-\nnotice).\n\nThese charges were made, for offences under Section 21A of the Infectious\nDiseases Act, as both had left their place of residence for long periods\nduring the notice and were not present at home during checks made by the\nauthorities.\n\nIn light of this, the Immigrations and Checkpoint Authority (ICA) has\nreiterated that it will \"not hesitate to take firm enforcement action against\nthose who fail to comply with the SHN requirements.\"\n\n\"Besides prosecuting offenders under the Infectious Diseases Act and its\nRegulations, ICA may also cancel their immigration facilities, where\napplicable.\"\n\nAll travellers have been reminded to ensure they submit complete and accurate\nhealth and travel declarations via the SG Arrival Card; Anyone who makes a\nfalse or misleading declaration will be liable to prosecution under the\nInfectious Diseases Act.\n\nThe penalty for providing false or misleading information is a fine of up to\nS$10,000 and/or imprisonment of up to six months, and, for subsequent\noffence(s), a fine of up to S$20,000 and/or imprisonment of up to 12 months\nwill be imposed.\n\nFor foreigners, ICA may also take further administrative actions, such as the\nrevocation of, or shortening of, the validity of permits and passes to remain\nin Singapore.\n\n* * *\n\n### Human Resources Online is on Telegram!

is a must-have for many employees today. According to the consultant\ngroup, Guthrie Jensen, 68% of workers consider [training and development the\nmost important company benefit](https://guthriejensen.com/blog/statistics-\nemployee-training/).\n\nAnd these educational perks don\u2019t just result in more engaged employees.\n[Companies that invest in employee\ntraining](https://guthriejensen.com/blog/statistics-employee-training/) also\nhave a 24% higher profit margin than companies that don\u2019t.\n\nProviding learning and development opportunities to your employees should be a\nno-brainer, but the costs can still be a hard pill to swallow.\n\nHolding in-person classes or sending productive employees away to seminars is\nexpensive. Businesses want to train employees while staying within budget.\n\nLearning management systems (LMS) offer a cost-friendly alternative to\ntraditional training sessions. They\u2019re used by businesses to help employees\nlearn and grow in their jobs - without breaking the bank.\n\n## What is a learning management system?\n\nA learning management system delivers and tracks educational and training\ncontent online. E-learning tools include customizable content, mobile lessons\nand gamification. A LMS is used by companies to onboard and train employees,\nand it can improve engagement and retention.\n\nHere are five cost-friendly training ideas using LMS software.\n\n## 1\\. Offer on-demand training and professional development\n\nEmployees are more likely to stay with a company when they\u2019re offered\nprofessional development opportunities, such as management skills or sales\ntraining.\n\nThe cost, however, of hiring instructors, renting a physical classroom and\ncoordinating times when all employees can attend classes can often be too\nhigh.\n\nLMS software provides on-demand classes that employees can access online or\nthrough mobile devices. That means businesses save on teachers, facilities and\nlost productivity.\n\nVendors often use a software-as-a-service (SaaS) pricing model, so customers\npay a subscription fee instead of a large upfront cost. Typically, the fee is\n$5 or less per learner, per month.\n\nIn addition, having managers run training sessions isn\u2019t always a good idea.\nThey may not have the experience or time necessary to prepare course materials\nor accurately assess performance.\n\nOn the other hand, LMS software can help employees learn efficiently and\neffectively, because they\u2019re designed using teaching best practices. These\ninclude microlearning, multimedia, pre- and post-training assessments,\nconvenient access and individual learning paths.\n\n## 2\\. Onboard new employees\n\nStudies show engaged employees stay with companies longer, and engagement\nbegins with a structured onboarding program.\n\nLMS software can provide educational materials to help new hires get\nacclimated to your company\u2019s culture and the responsibilities of their role.\n\nBecause some solutions include more features than you would ever possibly\nneed, it pays to find a vendor with a per-use pricing plan. This allows\nclients to opt out of certain parts of the software and pay only for what they\nput to use.\n\nThis could mean being charged based on certain modules, the number of active\naccounts or a specific piece of content. It depends on the arrangement made\nbetween the vendor and client.\n\nPrices generally range from $1 to $10 per use. Companies that don\u2019t need to\ntrain employees regularly or only need an LMS platform to onboard new hires\nshould consider this option.\n\n## 3\\. Provide online industry certifications\n\nSome industries or jobs, such as human resources, healthcare and safety,\nrequire certifications or continuing education credits.\n\nIn the past, this meant employees had to travel and miss work to attend days-\nlong seminars and classes. Now, an LMS solution can help businesses with these\nindustry-specific requirements either by providing on-demand content available\nin its internal library or by partnering with third-parties to deliver\nlessons.\n\nAdditionally, LMS software can help administrators track which employees need\nadditional credits and when certification must be renewed.\n\nIn this situation, vendors usually charge companies per course. Compared to a\nper use pricing plan, there\u2019s a premium, since the content is specialized for\ncompliance-focused industries. However, this option should still be much\ncheaper than in-person certification classes.\n\n## 4\\. Try open-source or free versions of LMS software\n\nMany companies want the ability to deliver training and education but don\u2019t\nneed all the bells and whistles that come with advanced software. In this\ncase, open-source or free versions of LMS solutions may be a good option, as\nthey generally include basic functionality and provide access for a limited\nnumber of users.\n\nOpen-source LMS software has source code that\u2019s publicly available. Companies\ncan download, install and customize the software on their own, for free. Some\nLMS vendors also offer free versions of their software.\n\nBusinesses that choose these options will still have to consider\nimplementation, customization, integrations and maintenance. In particular,\ninstalling and customizing open-source software can be complicated for\ncompanies that haven\u2019t used an LMS before, and there\u2019s no support if something\ngoes wrong.\n\nCompanies that choose this route should also have a knowledgeable in-house IT\nteam or hire implementation consultants. But if your company already has the\ntechnical know-how, using open-source software can provide a cost-friendly\nalternative.\n\n## 5\\. Use a premade course library or build custom content\n\nOne of the difficulties of training employees is finding relevant content to\nyour business.\n\nIn response, many LMS vendors offer course libraries with premade lessons for\na variety of industries, from safety to workplace ethics to sales. Companies\nshould research vendors to see if they have content for their specific needs.\n\nBusinesses that have more site-specific requirements, such as assembly line\nprocedures, often rely on third-party professionals to create training videos.\nHowever, this can be a costly process.\n\nLMS software provides course authoring tools that can help organizations\ncreate course content using templates or from scratch. And it\u2019s not generic\ncontent either. The software can handle a range of content from site-specific\nvideos to PowerPoint slides and also make interactive quizzes and games.\n\nIf your company doesn\u2019t have the resources to create this content, some\nvendors can also create custom training courses. This service may be charged\nper hour or as a one-time fee. But the benefit of using an LMS content creator\nversus a third-party is that the content will be designed to be used in their\nspecific software.\n\n## Bottom line\n\nInvesting in an LMS solution shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly. You should make sure\nto talk with potential users who\u2019ll receive training and figure out which key\nperformance indicators will be affected. If implemented correctly, however,\nthe software can significantly reduce your overall training costs.\n\nYou can find more details on expenses in this [2019 LMS pricing\nguide](https://www.betterbuys.com/lms/lms-pricing-guide/).

But the good news is, \u201cHR has the ability to experiment with\nsmaller pieces of technology, pilot it and then institutionalize it,\u201d shared\nNiketh Sundar, Global Head, People Function, QuEST Global, in a recent\ninteraction.\n\n![\u2018HR function is at the forefront of adopting technologies in\norganization\u2019](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1584513962/1584513960.jpg)\n\nNiketh Sundar, Global Head, People Function, QuEST Global believes that the\ndays are not too far when HR folks will start contributing to multiple\ncompanies, while not being employed permanently at any of them.\n\nWith technology as an ally and the rise of short-term contracts or freelance\nwork, the HR role is sure to evolve and its scope is also expected to\nincrease. In a recent interaction with People Matters, Sundar discussed how\nthe role of HR is changing and shared his vision of the future of work and\nrole of next-gen technology in redefining the HR function.\n\nHere are some excerpts from the interaction:\n\n### How has the role of HR evolved over the past decade, especially in the\nAPAC region?\n\nIn APAC and particularly in India, there has been tremendous growth in the\ntech industry \u2013 primarily in the services sector and product sector to some\nextent. In the process, HR also went through a massive transformation. In the\ntech industry, HR was required to induct, manage and retain large numbers of\npeople, skilled in technology and this made them think beyond the ordinary.\n\nHR leaders in India who earlier looked up to the west to adopt best practices\nfor their region, now were at the forefront of innovation in HR. With the\nchanges in the business and multi-pronged growth approaches, for companies\nlike QuEST Global, many processes, such as, HR operations, talent management\nand succession planning have evolved.\n\nWith growing emphasis on M&A and Integration, there are several opportunities\nto implement new strategies and practices, supported by robust systems and\ntools. HR has an important role to play as business leaders of the\norganization; the role of HR is becoming more strategic.\n\n### How has automation in HR impacted managing talent in your industry? Is it\na challenge or an opportunity?\n\nWhile automation has been present in the HR system for many years now, the\nlevel of automation has changed considerably. Starting from punch cards of\nyesteryears, to where we are today, there\u2019s been a huge transformation.\n\n> Today the HR function is probably at the forefront of adopting technologies\n> in organizations.\n\nSince the HR function is all about people, technology adoption that will\nincrease efficiency and improve employee experience, even in small ways, is\nalways welcome. Additionally, HR has the ability to experiment with smaller\npieces of technology, pilot it and then institutionalize it.\n\nHuman Resource Management Systems (HRMS) and Enterprise Resource Planning\n(ERP) systems brought in some of the most crucial transformations in the HR\ndomain. With these systems emerging, entire businesses from finance to HR,\ncould be all managed with a single ERP or multiple systems. Cloud computing\nhas brought in even more flexibility to bolt-on the right modules. With more\nmodern technologies under the fold, there's even a larger transformation on\nthe cards. Today, automation can be seen across the HR lifecycle, right from\nthe process of searching and reaching out to prospective candidates,\nscheduling interviews, background checks to on-boarding, etc.\n\nNext-gen technology will be playing a disruptive role in the HR domain in the\ncoming days. Along with automation, technology is playing an impressive role\nin Employee Performance Management Systems (EPMS). Tech-enabled EPMS are\ngetting customized for organizations so that their competency models can be\nfed into them and performance can be combined with training and development.\nLearning management systems are plenty today with e-learning being the\nbackbone of all the learning methodologies. Now content can be created\ninternally or bought off the shelves in packages \u2013 or as use-and pay.\n\nThe technologies in Learning & Development for instance, are fully\ncustomizable for individual learners based on AI. Today, tools are able to\npre-empt what the learner is looking for and push it to the learner. So yes,\nautomation is a massive opportunity for the HR industry.\n\n> The focus would be to provide positive, engaging experiences to employees,\n> while optimizing processes, and helping organizations to achieve their\n> vision of being boundary less.\n\n### How do you envision the future of work and role of next-gen technology in\nredefining the role of HR?\n\nTechnology, in itself, is changing the way we work and will be the primary\nfactor driving change in the future. With the emergence of high speed internet\nand connectivity, we are going to have a very flexible workforce in the coming\ndays. The labor market will most likely see a huge prevalence of short-term\ncontracts or freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs.\n\n> The days are not too far when HR folks will start contributing to multiple\n> companies, while not being employed permanently at any of them.\n\nWork from home is already a norm at many enterprises, contractual workers are\non the rise and the future will also see the older generation contributing to\nthe workforce. In other words, this will help organizations bring in the\nconcept of a diverse, shared workforce within their teams for better\nproductivity and efficiency.\n\nAlong with the way people work, technology will also change organizational\nstructures. Organizations will probably become flatter in nature with very\nless hierarchies. Information flow will be seamless across all levels and in\nturn, the paradigm of leadership will also shift. With the availability of\ndata and an empowered workforce, decisions will be data driven and AI enabled,\neven from employees at the lower levels. Rather than being responsible for\ndecision making, leaders will have to differentiate themselves on human and\nemotional indices like empathy and the ability to motivate their people.\nCoaching and mentoring could play an even bigger role in the future.\n\n### How should HR leaders upskill themselves to become future-ready?\n\nThe HR domain will have to be closer than ever to the business to make sure\nthey are aligned to the objectives and function accordingly. HR leaders should\nbe open to adopting newer technologies and understand them better to stay\nrelevant in future. As most of the HR tools in the future will be on\nsmartphones and other gadgets, HR leaders have to be conversant with\nunderstanding these systems and leveraging data to function more effectively.\nIn terms of up-skilling, there are lots of e-learning courses available out\nthere. However, just these courses will not be enough and HR leaders will have\nto apply these learnings in their day-to-day work to be future-ready. They\nwill also have to make sure that the systems and tools are well integrated so\nthat data collection and analytics is seamless.\n\nHence, larger organizations will have to have an _**HR tech leader**_ working\nto use data and analytics across functions such as performance assessment,\nengagement, retention, etc.\n\n### Going forward, what do you think will be YOUR #NextCurve as an HR\nprofessional? What are some roles that you envision HR professionals to be\ndoing more in the future?\n\nGoing forward, HR leaders will have to transform the way they think and look\nat themselves as Business Leaders and own the HR function.\n\nIn the future, particularly in the tech services industry, HR managers will\nneed to work even more closely with business managers. With more and more data\navailable, they will be applying analytics to take business partnerships to\nthe next level. As the transactional side of the HR function will be tech\ndriven, HR leaders will have the bandwidth to analyze data to understand and\ndemonstrate how the people function could be leveraged to generate more\nrevenue and profits for the organization. The HR domain will be able to\nprovide much deeper insights to the organization in the future and that\njourney has already begun.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Technology](/category/technology-\noutsourcing/technology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=technology \"Browse\nmore in: Technology\"), [Strategic HR](/category/leadership-strategy/strategic-\nhr?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=strategic-hr \"Browse more in: Strategic\nHR\"), [HR Technology](/category/hr-technology/hr-\ntechnology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hr-technology \"Browse more in:\nHR Technology\"),\n[#MyNextCurve](/tag/mynextcurve?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=mynextcurve\n\"Browse more in: MyNextCurve\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Drishti Pant](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1514013807/authors/drishti-\npant.jpg)](/author/drishti-pant)\n\n#### [Drishti Pant](/author/drishti-pant)\n\nDrishti Pant is Senior Associate - Content with People Matters.

A\ngrowing number of organizations recognize the power of teams, changing the way\nthey do work, and adopting team-based structures. These organizations are\nseeing that shifting their model is helping to improve organizational\nperformance. But moving to this model does not come without challenges, and\norganizations are continually looking for tools that can empower their teams\nto succeed. While there is a vast array of tools and technology available,\norganizations can also look to learning technology to help teams quickly\nupskill and collaborate towards a common goal.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n## **The rise of teams**\n\n[As research shows](https://trendsapp.deloitte.com/reports/2019/global-human-\ncapital-trends/organizational-performance.html), the advantages of an agile,\nteam-driven business style, organizational models are steadily changing from\nthe traditional hierarchies to cross-functional digitally-connected \"people\nnetworks.\" In this new world, teams form and change quickly, people move\naround regularly, and new business ideas and projects spin up and wind down as\nneeded to meet business goals.\n\nPreparing for this level of teaming can be challenging\u2014but the rewards are\nworth it. Deloitte's[ research\nshows](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/HumanCapital/ao-\nteam.pdf) that ideas developed by teams with three or more members have a 156\npercent greater appeal to customers than plans from one or two key\ncontributors. When team members bring diverse perspectives, unique skill sets,\nand broad experiences, an organization's potential can grow in measurable\nways. High-performing teams often radiate strength, adaptability, and\nresilience, which can resonate throughout an organization to improve other\ngroups and overall business performance.\n\nPlacing a greater emphasis on teams both relies on and helps strengthen\nindividual performance: The opportunity to work on different teams and try new\nways of working and collaboration can provide a natural path for people to\ndevelop new skills and insights.\n\nBut with this shift, some employees may struggle to transition so quickly into\na new way of working and collaborating. Employees need to be able to learn and\nadapt rapidly to understand their objectives and collaborate with their new\nteam members. Organizations have the opportunity to empower their workers to\nmake that shift using different types of digital tools, ranging from\ncollaboration platforms to digital learning platforms.\n\n**Learn More:[5 Predictions for the Next Decade of Corporate\nL&D;](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/predictions-for-the-next-decade-of-corporate-ld/)**\n\n# **Teaming through Learning Technology**\n\nShifting organizational models and ways of working is one aspect of enabling\nteam-based work. These structures help give organizations and employees\nguidance, but there is still an element of learning that is required to thrive\nin a team-based environment. Additionally, more and more teams are\ngeographically dispersed and require digital solutions to allow them to work\ncollaboratively as a team. Luckily for organizations, there are many different\ntypes of learning technology platforms and tools that can help enable this\nteam-based work. These tools can not only help the teams to collaborate but\ncan also allow individuals to learn quickly as they shift between different\nteams and priorities. While there are many different platforms and tools to\nchoose from, below are three groups of learning technologies that can help\nenable team performance.\n\n  * **Learning Experience Platforms (LXP)** : When individuals are shifting between different teams and opportunities, they often need ways to upskill themselves on relevant information quickly. Curation based learning experience platforms can help enable learners to access appropriate learning faster and more efficiently. For example, learning experience platforms utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) features that help to personalize and contextualize learning for employees. These features can recognize when they have been added to a new team and recommend learning and resources that are relevant to their new assignment.  \n\n  * **Cohort Based Program Delivery Platforms** : As previously mentioned, providing opportunities for employees to learn and collaborate can help them shift into a team-based mindset. Cohort-based, time-bound digital boot camps bridge geographic gaps, build camaraderie, and support teams to learn how to establish a shared understanding of business goals, strategies, and day-to-day tactics. For example, Deloitte's Business Chemistry Digital Experience, powered by AdeptPro, allows cohorts of teams to identify their working style and understand how to better collaborate within the workplace.  \n\n  * **Knowledge Management** : Quickly sharing knowledge across an organization is paramount when teams are working in an agile environment. Organizations have the opportunity to not only leverage the collective intelligence of their employees but also find ways to provide them with easy access to this intelligence. These technologies also help so that no knowledge is lost when team structures change or shift and allow employees easy access to relevant information.\n\n**Learn More:[Adopting an Innovative Approach to Employee Training Program &\nEmployee Engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/adopting-an-innovative-approach-to-employee-training-program-\nemployee-engagement/)**\n\nThese three technologies are a few of the options available for organizations\nto leverage to enable the transition to a team-based model. The below graphic\noutlines additional learning technologies that are available for organizations\nto leverage\n\nThe experience gained through utilizing a digital learning tool can help\nworkers become more effective at influencing and collaborating with teammates\nwhile assisting organizations in achieving the most from new cross-functional\nteaming models. Many organizations already utilize these tools, and simply\nneed to shift their perspective on how they can use them to empower their\nemployees and teams.\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fleveraging-digital-learning-tools-to-drive-\nteaming%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Leveraging+Digital+Learning+Tools+to+Drive+Teaming\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Leveraging+Digital+Learning+Tools+to+Drive+Teaming&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fleveraging-digital-learning-tools-to-drive-\nteaming%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fleveraging-digital-learning-tools-to-drive-\nteaming%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fleveraging-digital-learning-tools-to-drive-\nteaming%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Leveraging Digital Learning Tools to Drive\nTeaming&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fleveraging-digital-learning-tools-to-drive-\nteaming%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Learning & Development ](/category/learning-development/\n\"Learning & Development\")\n\n  * [ ![How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the Future](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/all_about_pwcs_digital_upskilling_program_and_how_you_can_take_inspiration_from_it_5e5fb8b6e3968.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-pwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-future-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the\nFuture ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\npwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-\nfuture-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nPwC has made digital upskilling a top priority to prepare for the future of\nwork.

Imbalance at Workplace\n\n![CXOtoday News\nDesk](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/698fa9b223721385ee2d50a38388d3a2?s=22&d=mm&r=g)[CXOtoday\nNews Desk](https://www.cxotoday.com/author/cxonewsdesk/) __3 weeks ago\n\n![AI](https://www.cxotoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Artificial-\nIntelligence-1.jpg)\n\nBy Prasad Rajappan\n\nAs per the research and study by the [World Economic\nForum](https://www.weforum.org/reports/gender-gap-2020-report-100-years-pay-\nequality#report-nav), none of us will see gender parity in our lifetimes, and\nnor likely will many of our children. That\u2019s the sobering finding of the\nGlobal Gender Gap Report 2020, which reveals that gender parity will not be\nattained for 99.5 years. Despite several measures taken across the globe\nGender inequality remains consequential and multidimensional. We can tackle\nthe Gender Imbalance in the workplace by harnessing technologies and practices\nsuch as AI/ML, strong HR policies, capturing the female progression through\nlearning management systems and succession planning. Let us examine each of\nthese technology practices one by one.\n\n**Adopt AI/ML and Robotic Interviews in Hiring to Reduce Gender Bias**\n\nAI is disrupting every day in the life, including how organizations are hiring\ntoday. With the new technologies in the new world of AI-based hiring could\nhelp us reduce error and bias in our hiring and onboarding processes. A lot of\nresearch has highlighted an inconsistency around gender imbalance. One of the\nbiggest advantages of AI is that it is great at ignoring things. Just imagine\na scenario a person who is intellectual, ethical, and open-minded who is fair\nin the hiring practices with no intention of being gender-biased, sees a\nfemale candidate sitting in front of him. He may think that though this person\nis a woman I am not giving my evaluation with any bias in my mind. AI can be\ntrained to ignore things like anyone\u2019s gender and focus on relevant aspects\nlike experience, skills, and the potential of that person. With AI and Machine\nLearning, the algorithms can be trained in such a way that it will be blind to\ngender. Machine learning can throw up the compatible candidates who are fit\nfor the job role.\n\n**Career Progression of Female Employees through Learning Management Systems**\n\nCareer Progression is a significant tool for both organisations and their\nemployees. When any employees are confused about what are the career\ndevelopment options available to them or the Business is unclear about what\nwill be the learning path which is required to achieve the Business Outcomes,\ncareer progression delivered through learning management system can provide\nthe needed clarity. Career Progression of female employees conducted through\nLMS systems can provide the basis for an individual\u2019s learning and a guide\nagainst which they can measure their progression.\n\n**Strong HR Policies on Gender Discrimination**\n\nAt any workplace, on an average 1 out of 4 women have been either physically\nor mentally harassed. Three in ten young women (30%) said they had experienced\nsex discrimination when working or looking for work. 75% of young women and\n58% of young men said that women still face discrimination in the workplace.\nEmployers should take measures to avoid such misdemeanors to happen at the\nworkplace. It is preeminent to have a strict policy against workplace offences\nlike gender discrimination, sexual harassment, racism, bullying, and many\nmore. Each and every organization should ensure that they have strong HR\npolicies in place and for such offences they are penalized.\n\n**Accelerate Female Progression with Succession Planning**\n\nThe major reasons why succession planning and leadership development are of\nextreme importance and can help in accelerating female progression are\nrecruitment and retention of the best talent, greater leadership\nresponsibility despite the gender imbalance. With succession planning in\nplace, the progression and identification of the successor will be formal,\nSystemic, tailored, experientially based instead of the gender biases.\n\nChanges in societal attitudes have helped significantly, however, it is\nthrough harnessing the AI, machine learning, strong HR policies, capturing the\nfemale progression through learning management systems and succession planning\nin place we can remove the gender gap in business once and for all.\n\n_(_ _Prasad Rajappan is a visionary and a thought leader, who brings nearly\nthree decades of HR experience into_ reputed companies, like Reliance\nIndustries, Ernst & Young and Mahindra & Mahindra.

The top HR priorities for the next\ndecade will be to build critical skills, strengthen the leadership bench, and\nimplement organizational design and change management.\n\nWhile CHROs seem to be aware of these [pressing\nchallenges](https://www.kornferry.com/insights/articles/chro-pulse-survey-2019\n\"Research Link\"), research suggests that not many are [entirely confident of\ntackling them head-on](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/pl/pdf/2019/05/pl-\nRaport-KPMG-The-future-of-HR-2019-In-the-Know-or-in-the-No.pdf \"Research\nLink\"). One reason behind this uncertainty is that digital transformation has\nnot just forced organizations to redesign their business models and processes,\nbut also their management practices. The use of next-gen technology in HR has\ndisrupted the [already-evolving\nfunction](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-\ntrends/2017/digital-transformation-in-hr.html \"Research Link\"), giving rise to\nnew challenges and opportunities. To understand these shifts, it would help to\nretrace the role of HR and contextualize the change taking place in the last\ndecade. Here\u2019s a look at how new-age technology and tools have helped\ntransform the core functions of HR:\n\n### The shift to a purpose-based HR\n\nFor the longest time, the core function of HR tools and systems has been to\nmaintain a system of record. HR\u2019s role was only a transactional necessity\nbetween the employee and the employer.\n\nThe proliferation of next-gen tech in HR is helping organizations keep track\nof people\u2019s work, undertake objective performance assessment, measure\nengagement, and support employees in making their work-life easier. This shift\nfrom a process-based to a purpose-based HR has paved the way for organizations\nto manage their employees as people and not just resources.\n\n### Meeting the changing workforce expectations\n\nThe next discernible change in HR has been the realization of how vital it is\nto address people's challenges in a timely fashion. Whether its challenges\npertaining to working remotely or digitizing functional HR activities like\nrecruitment, engagement, and assessment \u2013 all of which have been strengthened\nby the inclusion of employee data, advanced tools and devices have helped\norganizations capture and analyze an employee data. Thus, quarterly, or\nyearly, appraisals have given way to continuous feedback, continuous learning\nand continuous rewards.\n\n### Increased focus on experience\n\nThe transition from process-based to purpose-based HR has been enabled by\nsystems and technologies that are designed around \u2018experiences.\u2019 This has\nresulted in HR systems and tools to become more intuitive, user-friendly, and\nadaptive. One of the biggest consequences of this has been the inclusion of\nmulti-disciplinary experts in the HR function, which, up until a decade ago,\nwould have been difficult to imagine. Today, leading organizations are hiring\nexperts in analytics, artificial intelligence, user interface/experience, and\ndesign thinking to improve workplace experience.\n\nTechnologies like robotics process automation, machine learning, natural\nlanguage processing are being leveraged to develop simple, and seamless HR\nsystems. Similarly, the increasing use of digital tools to measure health and\nwellness has also helped collaborate with mental health experts, fitness\ncoaches, and dieticians. This has made it possible for experts with diverse\nknowledge to build cohesive HR solutions that ensure maximum optimization and\nefficiency.\n\nHR leaders and professionals must work towards aligning the entire HR function\nto ensure that employees can perform to their potential. They need to leverage\nnew technologies to empower and engage employees with systems that can deliver\na smooth workplace experience for a diverse workforce. Finally, they need to\nembrace the fact that being digital does not mean randomly using new\ntechnology and tools, but systematically using them to optimize existing human\ncapital management practices. These changes will not only make the HR function\nmore effective but also redefine its business scope in the organization. While\nthe process involves several experts and stakeholders, HR leaders must lead\nthe process of building systems that are truly adaptive, enhance productivity,\nand are designed for every employee in the organization.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Talent Management](/category/compensation-performance/talent-\nmanagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=talent-management \"Browse more\nin: Talent Management\"), [HR Technology](/category/hr-technology/hr-\ntechnology?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=hr-technology \"Browse more in:\nHR Technology\"), [#Design Thinking HR](/tag/design-thinking-\nhr?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=design-thinking-hr \"Browse more in:\nDesign Thinking HR\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Manav Seth](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1452578431/authors/manav-\nseth.jpg)](/author/manav-seth)\n\n#### [Manav Seth](/author/manav-seth)\n\nManav Seth is a freelance writer at People Matters.\n\n[NEXT STORY: The role of UI and UX in boosting employee experience\n](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/employee-engagement/the-role-of-ui-and-\nux-in-boosting-employee-experience-24802?page=2 \"Article: The role of UI and\nUX in boosting employee experience &ndash;

It's provided everyone a chance to belong.

Human\nResources is no different.\n\nOf course, there is a lot of noise out there and it can be an overwhelming\ntask to figure out where one should place their time and efforts.

The many features of\nan LMS have made it a popular choice among organizations and educational\ninstitutions. Integrating HR with LMS has several benefits and here\u2019s a list\nof six such benefits.\n\n####  1.Easier and Accurate Data Entry\n\nLMS requires data entry of all employees and so does the HRIS. Integrating\nboth of them means that you only need to enter the data once which will save\nyou the time of having to enter the data twice. All employee information like\neducational background, experience etc. are required for both the systems, so\nit\u2019s better to integrate them so that you just have to enter all the\ninformation once and you\u2019re done.\n\nDual information entry also means room for error. There\u2019s a higher possibility\nof data discrepancy if you have to enter data twice. Even a minor error of a\ndigit or letter can change the data records and cause problems. So the\nintegration of both the systems is going to be highly beneficial for data\nentry purposes.\n\n####  2\\. Identify Talent\n\nLMS tracks a trainees\u2019 progress and sends regular updates and reports to the\nmanagement. This progress tracker and records will help the HR identify top\ntalent in the organization, which will further help them allocate the trainee\nto the correct work profile. After identifying the talented resources of the\norganization, an LMS will enable you to provide further training to make them\nmore skilled and resourceful.\n\nOn the other hand, those trainees who may be lacking in their progress can get\nregular feedback and intervention from the HR, which will ensure that they do\ntheir best to improve on their training and courses.\n\n####  3\\. Easier Induction and Onboarding Process\n\nWhen a new employee is hired, the HR needs to conduct their induction and\nonboarding process. Integrating this with the LMS will make it easier to train\nemployees. Each time an employee is hired, they can be trained and inducted\nwith the LMS, making the training and induction process easier, time-saving\nand diverse in terms of its teaching methods.\n\nThe feature of accessibility in an LMS is the most beneficial for the HR. An\nemployee sitting anywhere at any time can receive training and the courses and\nlessons can be managed by the organization.\n\n####  4\\. Effective Online Training\n\nWhile the online training that LMS provides makes it easier to train\nemployees, it\u2019s a more effective form of training as well. LMS provides the\nanalytics of the data of an employee to provide more personalized results,\nbased on which you can get a complete record an overview of the progress of an\nemployee. It will show you their job description, past and present\nperformances, and their training progress. This will become difficult if you\ndon\u2019t integrate your HR with LMS because then you\u2019ll have to analyze the data\nfirst and then compile the information, whereas an LMS does this for you\nautomatically.\n\n####  5\\. Analytics and Patterns\n\nIf you integrate LMS with HR, you will be able to use the LMS data and\nprogress reports to analyze patterns like training to turnovers, promotions\ndue to training, contentment with training, work productivity with training.\nThis will further help the managers in making decisions regarding promotions,\ntrack the productivity of employees which will help managers take measures to\nimprove work productivity and turnovers. All of these will help the\norganization\u2019s overall work productivity.\n\n####  6\\. Cost Saving\n\nInstead of discarding your entire HRIS because you don\u2019t like the way your LMS\nworks with it, you can simply get an LMS that you know will work for your\norganization\u2019s needs. The [LMS software selection\nprocess](https://elearningindustry.com/lms-quote) is much more affordable and\ncost effective than getting a whole new HRIS.\n\n####  Conclusion\n\nLMS integration with HR is going to be very beneficial for an organization. It\nwill save time which means cost saving and also produce higher work\nproductivity. It\u2019s important to train employees if you want them to manage\ntheir responsibilities better. Tracking their progress and performance is also\nimportant to make any changes in the training process of the company for\nbetter results. LMS makes multiple jobs possible on one platform. You don\u2019t\nneed to segregate the work of HR and training with LMS integration.\n\nKeep up to date with industry news\n\nReceive our daily news straight to your inbox\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n  * [News](/news/all)\n  * [Directory](/directory/overview)\n  * [Pricing plans](/directory/price-plan)\n  * [Advertise](/advertise)\n  * [The Onrec Awards](/awards-categories)\n\n## Stay in touch\n\n  * [Twitter __](https://twitter.com/onrec)\n  * [Onrec LinkedIn Forum __](https://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&gid=78676)\n  * [Contact us](/contact-us)\n\nOnrec\n\nOnrec is for HR Directors, Personnel Managers, Job Boards and Recruiters\nproviding them with information on the Internet recruitment industry such as\nindustry news, directory and events.\n\nE-mail:\n\n[info@onrec.com](mailto:info@onrec.com)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 ONREC.

That number is expected to grow substantially as workplace trends,\nand state regulations increasingly emphasize workforce training. Recently,\nstates such as New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, and California have\npassed laws requiring training in the areas of unlawful harassment,\ndiscrimination and/or retaliation. The trend is expected to continue or even\naccelerate as many other states, including Massachusetts, Illinois, New\nJersey, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are considering similar or related\nlegislation.\n\nRather than outsource the software development, ThinkHR\u2019s Learn 3.0 was driven\nby customer input and analytics, designed and developed in-house through a\nunique collaboration between the company\u2019s technology and human resources\nexperts. With its latest upgrade, ThinkHR\u2019s platform is positioned for future\ngrowth and immediately provides employers with industry-leading security and\nperformance assurance, as well as an enhanced customer experience.\n\nNathan Christensen, CEO of the newly-combined entity of ThinkHR and [_Mammoth\nHR_](https://www.mammothhr.com), commented, \u201cOur focus is clear: to help\nemployers protect and grow their organizations by delivering the most\ninnovative, trusted solutions in the market. Training has never been more\nimportant, and we\u2019re committed to helping employers not only comply with\nemerging regulations but also build and develop their teams by bringing\ntogether technology and subject matter expertise. We\u2019re excited to announce\nLearn 3.0, which delivers immediate enhancements to our customers and paves\nthe way to future innovation.\u201d\n\nThinkHR\u2019s unique approach to delivering HR solutions is to combine industry-\nleading technology with high-touch employer and partner support in a full\nsuite of people risk management solutions. The company\u2019s popular People Risk\nManagement offering also enables companies to stay up-to-date with the latest\ncompliance changes and legislative mandates through proactive \u201cpush\u201d\nnotifications and living handbooks. All ThinkHR customers and partners,\nincluding leading insurance, payroll and HCM technology providers, can access\nthe company\u2019s team of HR experts via phone, chat or web.\n\nLearn 3.0 is available now.

HR has come a long way from processing employee paperwork to\nnow holding a strategic position and often a chief seat at the senior\nleadership table. Having founded a platform for complete candidate skills and\njob fit assessment, I see firsthand how adequate insight into candidates\u2019\nskills and behaviors can offer HR teams invaluable information that can aid in\nmeeting the most pressing personnel challenges.\n\nTo help you stay abreast of the changes, here is a closer look at the issues\nfacing HR this year:\n\n**1\\. Finding And Landing High-Quality Talent**\n\nWhen it comes to acquiring top talent, the game has changed. The tight labor\nmarket continues to create significant challenges for HR. In XpertHR\u2019s\nrecently released [survey](https://hrexecutive.com/these-are-the-top-hr-\nchallenges-in-2020/), \"Top HR Trends for 2020,\" HR professionals reported\nrecruiting and hiring as their most critical challenge. Of those respondents,\n51% said that their organization is facing an \u201cextreme challenge\u201d recruiting\nand hiring high-quality candidates, more than double the number (22%) from\njust two years ago.\n\nSo how can companies begin to bend the cost- and time-to-hire curves backward?\nCreate competitive advantages for talent processes by offering tailored\nincentives. Use skills tests and behavioral assessments during the initial\nstage of the hiring process, and determine what motivates top talent. For some\nnew hires, it may mean a larger paycheck, but for most employees, it means\ndevelopment opportunities, flexible working conditions, management\nresponsibilities, greater autonomy, a better job title or even the chance to\ndo good in the world.\n\n**2\\. The Revolving Door Of Talent**\n\nThe World Health Organization made headlines last year when it classified\nburnout as a medical diagnosis, [defining\nburnout](https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/burn-out/en/) as \u201ca\nsyndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has\nnot been successfully managed.\u201d Sixty-two percent of respondents to a survey\npublished in Emplify's \u201c2020 Employee Engagement Trends\u201d\n[report](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/a-new-workplace-study-says-\nhappy-burnout-proof-employees-boils-down-to-3-things.html) suffer from burnout\nat work. In the face of widespread burnout, it is not surprising that the same\nstudy found nearly 73% of respondents are open to new career opportunities,\nand for respondents who have been employed by their current company for less\nthan a year, that number is 77%.\n\nThe fight to retain top talent starts with making employee wellness a\npriority. Though the answer may not be as obvious as it seems, a\n[study](https://doi.org/10.1108/CDI-12-2016-0215) published in the journal\n_Career Development International_ found that many highly engaged employees\nare also exhausted and ready to leave their employer. Companies are at the\nmost significant risk of losing their most motivated and hard-working\nemployees due to high stress and burnout.\n\nThe solution? Develop processes to ensure that workloads are more reasonable.\nOffer flexible work options. Create a company culture that encourages work-\nlife balance. And educate staff about the warning signs of burnout and ways to\ncombat it.\n\n**3\\. Developing The Next Generation Of Leaders**\n\nBusinesses spend [billions of\ndollars](https://www.chieflearningofficer.com/2018/03/21/follow-the-\nleadership-spending/) annually on leadership development. The scarcity of in-\ndemand talent and the high cost of attracting and retaining talent means many\ncorporations are setting their sights on inside talent. Employees are more\nmotivated to stay with a company that offers leadership training, according to\na recent [survey](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/study-shows-workers-require-\ninnovative-130000257.html). However, 47% of respondents are dissatisfied with\ntheir employer\u2019s current learning and development opportunities and would\nprefer more flexibility in learning opportunities and real-world application\nwherever possible.\n\nTo retain employees, organizations need to create or expand leadership\ndevelopment programs to meet the needs of their workforce. Implementing\ninnovative approaches to learning new skills, such as self-guided online\nlearning, on-the-job coaching and virtual training can help improve engagement\nand lower costly employee turnover.\n\n**4\\. Finding Resources For Workforce Development**\n\nWhile mega-companies like Amazon are investing hundreds of millions of dollars\nin [workforce development\ninitiatives](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/11/740660070/from-the-warehouse-to-\nit-amazon-offering-100-000-workers-tech-training), many businesses are\nreluctant to invest heavily in training and development. Although there is no\npromise of a return on investment, organizations of all sizes should initiate\ntraining strategies and structures that grow over time and deliver a\ncompetitive advantage. Investing in the training and development of entry-\nlevel employees is a strategy that is gaining momentum, as their positions are\nmost easily filled once the trainee moves up the corporate ladder.\n\nTraining and development don\u2019t have to consume a massive portion of your\nbudget. Online evaluations and training courses are relatively inexpensive and\ncan provide employees with in-depth insight into their own skill sets and a\nself-guided path for learning new skills or improving existing skills.\nInvesting in your workforce will create a loyal, productive team.\n\n**5\\. Achieving Diversity With Inclusion**\n\nWorkplace bias \u2014 both conscious and unconscious \u2014 continues to impede the\nhiring, development and promotion of underrepresented groups. Although many\ncompanies have made great strides in hiring a more diverse workforce in recent\nyears, the likelihood that organizations will be able to retain this staff\nwithout explicitly structuring an inclusive workplace is low. Evaluating\nskills and gaining insight into behavioral patterns prior to an interview can\nhelp combat bias by elevating candidates based on job-fit metrics, not\ndemographics.\n\nIf HR focuses on diversity without creating a culture of inclusion, the\ndiverse mix of people we hire will be less likely to stay. Organizations must\nestablish strong policies to protect employees from negative behaviors.\nCreating a culture of inclusivity improves retention and acts as a magnet for\ntalent, drawing a more diverse set of applications. Companies must build an\ninclusive culture. Training to policies to ensure people are aware of their\nbiases and aware of how to not act on them is critical.\n\nAlthough the tight labor market presents some unique challenges, adopting\nthese recommendations can help your organization stay ahead of the curve.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Eric Friedman](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2019/07/ericfriedman_avatar_1563822669-400x400.jpeg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/ericfriedman/\n\"Photo of Eric Friedman\")\n\n[Eric\nFriedman](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/ericfriedman/)\n\nEric Friedman is the Founder and CEO of [eSkill](http://www.eskill.com), a\nglobal leader in skills testing and behavioral assessment solutions for\nemployers.\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Eric Friedman&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: Top Five Issues Facing Human Resources In 2020 %0A Author: Eric Friedman %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2020/04/06/top-five-issues-facing-human-resources-in-2020/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

Digital intimacy has\nbecome the new norm of life. Technology has turned into a ubiquitous commodity\nsuch that even a common man uses words like platforms, ecosystems, Machine\nLearning, AI and Robotics these days.\n\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic nudging most businesses to operate and work\nremotely, the demand for technology is further rising. But are all companies\nready for this change?\n\nA recent global study of more than 25000 Leaders across industries has\nrevealed that only 37 percent of business leaders are prepared to operate in\nsuch a Digital environment. In case of HR leaders, the number further fell\ndown to 16%. If Technology lever alone questions our future readiness as\nleaders, what if it gets quadrupled by adding Talent to the whole equation in\nbuilding new \u2013 age organizations? How Technology is further going to disrupt\nour day to day work? What does \u201cTalent of the future\u201d look like? What will\nthey do at work? How will it impact organizations?\n\nTo answer some of these questions, we closely examined the value of Talent and\nhow it has been influenced by different phases of Industrial revolution.\n\nFor instance, when the first industrial revolution brought mass production\nwith the advent of steam engines and mechanization of textiles in the 18th\ncentury, physical strengths and kinesthetic abilities of workers were valued\nas Talent and we refer to it as Talent 1.0. With the arrival of modern\nagriculture, Electricity and Internal combustion engines in the early 1900s,\nalso popularly known as the second Industrial revolution, standardization of\ngoods and services became a new norm. Due to this, a combination of both\nabilities and social skills were valued as Talent 2.0. During the latter half\nof the 20th century, the world witnessed proliferation of Information and\nDigital advancements in the form of the third Industrial revolution,\nindividuals and organizations were governed by connected devices and augmented\nintelligence. This demanded people to display a new set of competencies which\nhas a combination of not only skills and abilities but also knowledge needed\nto deal with familiar and unfamiliar situations. We call it as Talent 3.0.\n\nThe fourth Industrial revolution has begun due to the intersection of IT, Bio\nand Nano Technologies and its advancements. Studies estimate that 85% of\nfuture roles are going to be way too different than the ones that are existing\ntoday. Klaus Schwab, Chairman of the world economic forum along with stalwarts\nfrom across various faculties such as Business Leaders, Technologists,\nParliamentarians and Historians were set to discuss the future of work and its\nconsequences through multiple forums over the last four years.\n\nBased on our analysis of such conversations and our extensive study on Job\npredictions of reputed sources, we plotted these future jobs across sectors.\nMost of these jobs, we heard about for the first time.\n\nConsider the following terms, Organ Creator, Augment Reality Journey Builder,\nRewilder, Human Machine Teaming Manager, Digital currency Advisor etc. They\nare not science fiction terms but possible jobs of the future. It is quite\nfascinating to see that such jobs are going to be highly interdisciplinary and\nrequires people to display a new set of X factors to perform their duties at\nwork. These factors, in our view, are going to be unique and distinct from the\nprevious eras of Talent. We therefore call it \u201cTalent of the future\u201d or in our\nown words which we have coined \u201cTalent 4.0\u201d.\n\n**Talent 4.0 \u2013 The new factors**\n\nTake a case, Organ creators, whose job is to apply a combination of stem\ncells, molecular biology and synthetic materials to create Human organs. From\nan industry point of view, the job cuts across Manufacturing to Healthcare to\nRetail. Another job for example, Bewilders, who would work on turning back\nconcrete jungles into green belts and forests. Once again, it concedes that a\nsingle role will disrupt multiple industries such as Manufacturing, Energy,\nInsurance and Banking. When such roles come in to existence, we anticipate\nthat workers would require a completely different set of Talents to perform\nsuch jobs.\n\nIn our assessment, we see more than competencies (knowledge, skills and\nattributes), aspects like imagination, design, exploration, transcendence,\ncognitive flexibility and self - nudge would be more valued than ever and they\nare outlined as below:\n\n**Imagination**\n\nBe it an organ creator or a Rewilder, the performance of an individual in most\nfuture jobs is highly dependent on imagination. It means forming new ideas\nwith objects when not sensed by the body. It requires a lot of deliberate\nefforts to tap in to one\u2019s Executive portion of the Brain to visualize new\nform of organs or jungles or similar such objects. Just imagine, turning a\nconcrete jungle in to a forest!\n\n**Design**\n\nThe next key variable in our view is design which denotes creating plans or\nprototypes to show a function of an object. It plays a key role in any of\nthese future jobs like Human \u2013 Machine Teaming Manager where someone takes\ncharge of Teams where Humans and Robots would be working side by side. In such\njobs, it takes so much of design considerations to offer superior experiences\nto people thus demanding each one to become design conscious in the future.\n\n**Exploration**\n\nIt means exploring an unknown area. Future Jobs like Cyber city Detective who\ncould detect mysteries in data in Smart cities which demands data exploration\nin large volumes. Another study predicted jobs such as Digital Tailors who\nwould craft personalized services with a Digital touch by exploring motives\nand needs of people on one \u2013 to \u2013 one basis.\n\n**Cognitive Flexibility**\n\nIt represents the ease at which an individual can switch between multiple\nconcepts at a time. Be it juggling between boundaries of multiple\nspecializations or working in a Human \u2013 Machine Augmented system, Cognitive\nflexibility will be a game changer. Once again, it takes a lot of discipline\nand practice to comfortably navigate between areas yet being mentally alert at\nthe same time.\n\n**Self \u2013 nudge**\n\nIt is another variable which will be demanded in the future. It is needed to\nconstantly alter one\u2019s own behaviors to withstand the momentum of change by\ntapping in to mental shortcuts and assigning default choices. For instance, a\nDigital Tailor prioritizes Digital and imagination as autopilot responses than\ncustomizing on off - the - shelf solutions.\n\n**Transcendence**\n\nUpon going through some of the above jobs, you would have got a sense of how\nimportant it is to experience the connectedness of everyone and everything\nthat exists in this universe. This leads to the prediction of Transcendence as\nthe next key variable. Any of the above discussed jobs require some degree of\ntranscendence among Humans.\n\nThese six above mentioned factors, we call them as Human Ingenuity Factors\n(HIFs). As Oxford Dictionary defines ingenuity as the quality of being clever,\noriginal and inventive, it cannot be categorized as skills or attributes or\ncompetencies. While everyone possesses them, it is difficult to express as and\nwhen needed. Further, it is hard to draw a baseline for comparing individuals\non a scale, unlike the previous century definitions of Talent such as\nabilities, skills and competencies. Therefore, Talent of Future will be a\ncombination of competencies and Human Ingenuity Factors, thus paving way for a\nnew chapter in mankind, the Talent 4.0.\n\nThis conception, in our view, is fundamental to unravel many mysteries\npertaining to Talent of the future. And more we deep dived, we came out with\nmore questions and we intent to leave at least a couple of them for further\ninquiry. How are we going to assess, hire and retain Talent 4.0 based on Human\nIngenuity Factors? What will their development interventions look like? In the\ncase of Gig workers, how do we engage them? As French novelist Gustave\nFlaubert famously said \u201cTalent is a long patience, and originality an effort\nof will and intense observation \u201c, it\u2019s time to lay the foundations to\nmanifest Talent 4.0 or \u201cTalent of future\u201d.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Talent Management](/category/compensation-performance/talent-\nmanagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=talent-management \"Browse more\nin: Talent Management\"), [#GuestArticle](/tag/guest-\narticle?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=guest-article \"Browse more in:\nGuestArticle\"),\n[#COVID-19](/tag/covid-19?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=covid-19 \"Browse\nmore in: COVID-19\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Authors\n\n[![Sudhakar Sampath](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1586252923/authors/avatar-\nsudhakar-sampath.png)](/author/sudhakar-sampath)\n\n#### [Sudhakar Sampath](/author/sudhakar-sampath)\n\nSudhakar Sampath is working with Wipro Limited, Bangalore, India, as Manager,\nLearning and Development, Human Resources.\n\n[![Sarika Pradhan](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1586252809/authors/avatar-\nsarika-pradhan.png)](/author/sarika-pradhan)\n\n#### [Sarika Pradhan](/author/sarika-pradhan)\n\nSarika Pradhan is working with Wipro Limited, Bangalore, India as General\nManager- Human Resources.

Billion-dollar retraining programs and on-site corporate\ncolleges have become a reality. In a 2018 McKinsey survey, 62% of executives\nsaid they will need to retrain or replace more than a quarter of their\nworkforce before 2023.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nBusiness model disruptions, demographic shifts, and automation of rote tasks\nare putting more pressure on individuals to learn, and on employers to give\npeople the right skills at the right time.\n\nThere is reason for optimism. As we cover in our [HR Trends 2020\nreport](https://hello.visier.com/hr-trends-2020-ebook/), there have been many\nadvances in learning technology. Learning content is more plentiful, cheap,\nand accessible with the rise of massive open online courses.\n\nMany organizations have also experimented with providing a personalized\n\u201cNetflix learning experience\u201d for employees, leveraging Learning Experience\nPlatform (LXPs), micro-learning systems, and adaptive learning systems.\n\n**Reskilling: Nobody is Immune**\n\nEven with a willingness to explore new avenues, many challenges remain for\nlearning leaders. While employee skills data has become more accessible, few\norganizations have mastered the art of skills data maintenance. L&D;\ndepartments often use the LMS to measure learning effectiveness, which does\nlittle to determine whether learning investments are contributing to business\ngoals.\n\nBusinesses must find ways to overcome these challenges because reskilling\ndemands will only intensify as the pace of change continues to accelerate.\nLearning will no longer be a periodic one-and-done process, but a seamless\npart of work for everyone. Critical manager skill sets will also change\nbecause span of control will be broader with the rise of automation. Nobody\nwill be immune from reskilling demands.\n\nOver the next decade, organizations will proactively:\n\n  * Hone in on learning\u2019s business impact. The availability of tools on the market that facilitate \u201cin-the-moment\u201d learning will continue to increase, but HR leaders will still be under pressure to determine whether the business is getting the ROI it needs from learning initiatives. More learning leaders will turn to a unified analytics platform that connects learning to all aspects of the employee lifecycle to business data, which will enable the C-suite to instantly see the impact of learning programs on business results. \n\n  * Evaluate immersive learning solutions. Exciting advances in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have provided organizations with a promising way to give hands-on training for scenarios that are either dangerous or difficult to replicate in the real world. Only a few visionaries have adopted VR/AR for corporate learning programs; Gartner predicts [that mainstream adoption is up to 10 years away](https://hello.visier.com/gartner-hype-cycle-human-capital-management-hcm/). In the nearer future, organizations will start to evaluate immersive learning solutions to determine whether they provide substantial business value.\n\n  * Tackle the skills data challenge. Getting up-to-date information about skills is challenging at best, if not impossible. Employees typically only update their skills profile when they are looking for work (and even then, they are making the updates on LinkedIn or to their resumes\u2013not the company skills repository). Finding ways to keep skills data current and readily available will continue to be a challenge. However, with improvements in AI and machine-learning techniques, along with new nudge engine tools, technology leaders will come up with solutions to this problem. \n\n  \n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\nIf L&D; falls under your area of responsibility at your organization, now is\nthe time to get into the driver\u2019s seat. Follow these tips to future-proof your\nbusiness with strategic learning initiatives--and elevate your own role within\nthe organization:\n\n  * Forecast the new wave of jobs and identify their corresponding skills. \n\n    * Connect with senior business leaders and line managers to determine which skills will be in demand. This process will have to be constant and flexible, as skills needs will likely change every 5-10 years.\n\n  * Determine how much of a learning investment is required to meet business goals using the time to productivity metric. \n\n    * Time to productivity is very important because it is an indicator of how much investment is required to reach your business goals. To get this metric, calculate the sum of days to productivity for the analysis group and divide that by the number of employees in the analysis group. The more aggressively you need to shorten time to productivity, the higher the learning investment.\n\n  * Monitor courses and compare learning outcomes so that they can drive the best business results \n\n    * Dig into your people data to determine whether participants from a specific reskilling program are experiencing more internal movement, flowing from low-demand to high-demand positions.\n\n  \n**Learn More:[How to Engage Generation Z in Workplace Learning &\nDevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\nto-engage-generation-z-in-workplace-learning-development/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhr-in-2020-reskilling-goes-into-\noverdrive%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=HR+in+2020%3A+Reskilling+Goes+Into+Overdrive\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=HR+in+2020%3A+Reskilling+Goes+Into+Overdrive&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhr-in-2020-reskilling-goes-into-\noverdrive%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhr-in-2020-reskilling-goes-into-\noverdrive%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhr-in-2020-reskilling-goes-into-\noverdrive%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=HR in 2020: Reskilling Goes Into\nOverdrive&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhr-in-2020-reskilling-goes-into-\noverdrive%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Learning & Development ](/category/learning-development/\n\"Learning & Development\")\n\n  * [ ![How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the Future](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/all_about_pwcs_digital_upskilling_program_and_how_you_can_take_inspiration_from_it_5e5fb8b6e3968.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-pwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-future-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the\nFuture ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\npwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-\nfuture-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nPwC has made digital upskilling a top priority to prepare for the future of\nwork.

Best](http://hrmasia.com/category/regular-features/five-of-the-\nbest/) is a weekly series highlighting the best HR service providers across\nSingapore and the Southeast Asia region. It is brought to you by\n[www.hrmasia.com](http://www.hrmasia.com/)._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/HRIS-79466851_m-1.jpg)\n\nThere\u2019s simply no way to overstate the value of a good HR Information System\nto any employing organisation. With some of the key touchpoints between staff,\nand across levels, it is the lifeblood of not just the HR team, but the entire\norganisation as a whole.\n\nOf course, it needs to be functional. And for many years, this was the only\nconsideration HR leaders had in choosing a system (or different modules) to\nimplement. As long as the payroll was delivered on time and accurately, and\nexpense claims were able to be examined, the system was said to be doing its\njob.\n\nBut these days, HR leaders are seeing the opportunities and risks within each\ntechnological solution they consider. They know that tech that isn\u2019t fully\nembraced by the workforce can impact retention, which means user experience\nhas become a vital point of difference.\n\nHere are five of the best service providers in this category:\n\n### JUZ TALENT\n\n**[www.juztalent.com](http://www.juztalent.com)**\n\n**+65 6384 3808**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JuzTalent-\nimage-250x175.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JuzTalent-\nimage.jpg)When businesses are considering investing in a workforce or payroll\nsolution, they\u2019ll likely begin to think about cost-effectiveness, automation,\nand value creation. The driver to JuzTalent's success by acquiring 50,000\nusers within three years has been due to understanding HR and complex payroll\nissues that every business will face in the different part of Southeast Asia.\n\nJuzTalent was built by professionals with deep HR understanding. It is a one-\nof-a-kind HRMS focused on the user\u2019s experience \u2013 from the effortless self-\nservice onboarding to radius clock-in and clock-out, personalised payslips,\nand not forgetting management and leaders are sent light-hearted notifications\nto keep the whole claim and leave processes moving.\n\nFurthermore, every client of JuzTalent is greeted with a realistic drawing of\nproblem-solving and results based insights. Whether it be small or mid-sized\nbusinesses, JuzTalent is able to provide an overview connecting an\norganisation\u2019s multiple entities operating under a single platform while they\nfocus and grow with autonomy.\n\n### BIPO\n\n[**www.biposervice.com**](http://www.biposervice.com)\n\n**+65 6877 6925**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BIPO-5-of-the-\nbest-1-250x141.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BIPO-5-of-\nthe-best-1.jpg)Founded in 2004, BIPO\u2019s Asia-Pacific Headquarters is in\nSingapore, with R&D Centres located in Singapore, Shanghai, Malaysia and\nIndonesia.\n\nBIPO\u2019s integrated, one-stop cloud and mobile-based HRMS platform helps\nbusinesses simplify and streamline HR processes. From payroll, leave\nmanagement, and claims to time and attendance management, each application is\ninterrelated yet easily customised to help businesses scale-up their\noperations with ease.\n\nOffering a great user-experience through its simple, user-friendly interface,\nBIPO\u2019s award-winning **time and attendance management system** uses technology\nsuch as GPS, biometrics and iris scanners to support its clocking devices,\nallowing employees who are constantly on-the-move to stay agile and connected.\n\nCompliant with local regulatory requirements across all the regions, BIPO\u2019s\nHRMS platform is LHDN-certified (PCB \u2013 Monthly Tax Deduction Calculation) in\nMalaysia and in Singapore, adheres to CPF and IRA8 online submission\nrequirements.\n\n### JUST LOGIN\n\n[**www.justlogin.com**](https://justlogin.com)\n\n**+65 6909 9217**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/justlogin-5ofbest-250x188.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/justlogin-5ofbest.jpg)In the last decade, the role of\nHRIS has shifted beyond just storing and tracking of employee data.

Closing the top three is proptech\nstartup Smarten Spaces, with its $12.47m (US$9m) funding last year.\n\nOther startups that joined the ranks include Quilt.ai ($12.47m), Sleek\n($6.93m), eko.ai ($5.54m), Syfe ($5.27m), Draper Startup House ($4.85m), Yours\n($4.85m), Travelstop ($4.16m), Osome ($4.16m), SEPPURE ($3.53m), atlan\n($3.46m), CHILD Health Imprints ($3.19m), Keyless ($3.05m), gush ($2.91m),\nNovelship ($2.84m), COVE ($2.78m), abillionveg ($2.78m), and Hydroleap\n($2.6m).\n\nThese 20 startups raised an average funding amount of about $7.85m, which was\na 47.32% plunge from the 2018 average of $14.9m.\n\n**ESG grabs spotlight**  \nEven though this year's list shows that deeptech startups are still dominant,\ngiven the Government's efforts to boost the flexibility of its operations in\nSingapore, investors are turning their heads to startups that are focussed on\nenvironmental, social and corporate governance (ESG). This comes on the back\nof increasing awareness towards sustainable and environmentally-friendly\nsolutions.\n\nFor instance, 12th placer SEPPURE offers chemical separation processes that\ncan be done without heat and at 90% less energy. It claims this can\npotentially conserve billions of gallons of water, millions of tonnes in\nvolatile organic compound emissions, and billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide\nemissions annually.\n\nAnother sustainable startup is abillionveg, a platform that allows users to\nsearch for highly reviewed plant-based food and where to find it around the\nglobe.\n\nIn Enterprise Singapore's study, investments in the urban solutions and\nsustainability domain surged 56% YoY during 9M 2019 to $150.4m, which can be\nattributed to increasing attention on cleantech and sustainability.\n\nSpecifically, the report noted that there is a growing interest in agri-food\ntech startups in this sector, where investment reached $28.3m, up from just\n$0.75m in the same period of 2018. This is said to be in line with the\ngovernment's push to develop Singapore into a leading food and nutrition hub\nin Asia. SEEDS Capital, Enterprise Singapore's investment arm, appointed seven\nco-investment partners in January 2019 to catalyse more than $90m worth of\ninvestments into agri-food tech startups.\n\n\"ESG investments are gaining traction because many of the limited partners\nhave realised that for long-term growth, ESG is an important pillar and whilst\nmany investments may not tick off each of the 'E', 'S' and 'G', starting off\nwith at least one criterion, it can lead to expanding the investment to\nothers,\" vice chairman of Business Angel Network of Southeast Asia (BANSEA)\n**Ramesh Raghavan** said.\n\nEngagement from foundations and institutional investors, such as pension\nfunds, is also starting to become more interested in long-term impact over\nshort-term gains as well.\n\n**Deeptech still at the helm**  \nIn Enterprise Singapore's latest figures on the startup scene, total\ninvestments from January to September 2019 hit $13.4b across 437 deals,\njumping 36% YoY from 2018. It noted that deeptech startups under advanced\nmanufacturing, urban solutions and sustainability, and healthcare and\nbiomedical sciences started to gain traction during this period, with\ninvestments in these three domains amounting to $416.4m across 76 deals. This\nrepresents a 25% YoY uptrend from $333.8m in 2018.\n\nHowever, these three sectors only make up 4% of the total capital invested due\nto the current ecosystem's lack of lead investors with the expertise and\nexperience to back deeptech startups.\n\n\"They must find new growth engines, including but not limited to regional\nexpansion,\" co-founder and managing director of East Ventures **Wilson Cuaca**\ncommented.\n\n\"The key focus is a road to profitability and startups should show much better\ncapital efficiency in their business models. Keeping customer acquisition cost\nlow and not looking for growth for growth's sake will be key,\" Raghavan added.\n\nApart from these figures, the same study mentioned that the number of\ninvestments made into digital tech startups skyrocketed 91.7% YoY to 278\ndeals, from 145 deals over the same period last year, which accounts for 93.2%\nof the total quantum.\n\nIn terms of funding rounds, early stage funding during the first three\nquarters of 2019 doubled to $886.1m across 304 deals compared to 2018 figures,\nwhilst growth stage funding amounts edged up 33% YoY to reach $12.5b with 83\ndeals.\n\n**VC funds go low-key**  \nOverall, venture capital (VC) firms cited a number of reasons as to why\ninvestment activity amongst startups seemingly quietened down in H2 2019.\n\nInvestment opportunities in Singapore still abound, according to Golden Gate\nVenture's principal **Justin Hall**. \"Many fundraising rounds go unannounced,\nthey're lumped into other rounds, or there are any other number of reasons\nthat might affect total funding. The truth is that the number of investable\nopportunities in Singapore and abroad has continued unabated,\" he said.\n\nEast Ventures' Cuaca added that investments also went to other emerging\nmarkets, such as Indonesia, where the ease of doing business has improved.\n\nIn contrast, Raghavan observed that overall funding in the ASEAN region,\nincluding Singapore, went down. Larger firms such as Grab have raised less\ncapital, whilst startups' need for financing also dipped.\n\nRaghavan also noted that issues around WeWork and its fundraising became a\nmajor wake-up call for investors and startups alike, noting that it was a big\nmoment for cash-burning startups.\n\n\"The WeWork saga also made investors a bit more cautious in jumping in wildly\nat expensive valuations,\" Raghavan said. \"Larger startups are focused on\nturning to profitability and less cash burn. Smaller startups have realised\nthat raising capital at extended valuations is not easy anymore and are\ntherefore focused on generating traction in a capital-efficient way.\"\n\nIn 2019, coworking firm WeWork pulled back its initial public offering plan in\nthe US, as investors had begun to question its profitability. Its valuation\nplunged from $67b (US$47b) to $14.25b (US$10b) and its biggest backer Softbank\ntook over from ousted co-founder Adam Neumann.\n\nAnother issue BANSEA's Raghavan cited was the souring investments on\ncryptocurrency-based startups. The industry has gone past its 2017 hype and\nits regulatory environment is still deemed unstable by many analysts, he said.\n\n\"Poor liquidity environment, uncertain regulatory outlook, lack of\ntransparency and issues of trust continue to hamper adaptability which is the\nkey driver for growth and there has been little movement in [the\ncryptocurrency] space. Time is of the essence here and if we get a common\nregulatory framework and transparent and interoperable exchanges and\ninfrastructure we will see improvement in more widespread network effect and\ngrowth,\" he explained.\n\nOn the other hand, the Singapore government is still launching programmes to\nsupport deeptech startups. During the Budget 2020 speech, Deputy Prime\nMinister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat announced the Startup SG\nEquity scheme, where the government will co-invest into eligible startups,\nalongside private third-party investors\n\nThe investment cap for each startup in the general tech industries is set at\n$2m, whilst deeptech firms may clinch up to $4m in the scheme. SEEDS Capital\nand SGInnovate have been appointed to manage the funds under Startup SG\nEquity.\n\nMoving forward, Cuaca has a positive outlook on Singapore's overall startup\nscene, regardless of the industry they are in. \"Most sectors are growing now\nbecause the region is hitting an inflection point,\" he said. \"Anyone who\nstarted in Singapore must quickly see the broader South East Asia and\nshouldn't stay in Singapore too long.\"\n\n\n\n![](/sites/default/files/misc/01ASPIRE.jpg)\n\n**1\\.

Want to see eyes glaze\nover quicker than you can finish this sentence? Mandate that busy employees\nattend a training session on \"business writing skills\", or \"conflict\nresolution\", or some other such course with little alignment to their needs.\nLike lean manufacturing and the lean startup before it, lean learning supports\nthe adaptability that gives organizations a competitive advantage in today's\nmarket. It's about learning the _core_ of what you need to learn, applying it\nto real-world situations immediately, receiving immediate feedback and\nrefining your understanding, and then repeating the cycle. In order to begin\npracticing lean learning, organizations need to move from measuring credits\nearned to measuring business outcomes created. Lean learning ensures that\nemployees not only learn the right thing, at the right time, and for the right\nreasons, but also that they retain what they learn.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/10/Oct19_02_200569109-001.jpg)\nGregor Schuster/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2019/10/where-companies-go-wrong-with-learning-and-\ndevelopment?language=es)\n\nOrganizations spent [$359\nbillion](https://www.trainingindustry.com/wiki/entries/size-of-training-\nindustry.aspx) globally on training in 2016, but was it worth it?\n\nNot when you consider the following:\n\n  * 75% of [1,500 managers surveyed](/2016/10/why-leadership-training-fails-and-what-to-do-about-it) from across 50 organizations were dissatisfied with their company\u2019s Learning & Development (L&D) function;\n  * [70% of employees](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-resources/role/learning-development) report that they don\u2019t have mastery of the skills needed to do their jobs;\n  * Only [12% of employees](https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/statistics-on-corporate-training-and-what-they-mean-for-your-companys-future) apply new skills learned in L&D programs to their jobs; and\n  * Only 25% of respondents to a recent [McKinsey](http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/getting-more-from-your-training-programs) survey believe that training measurably improved performance.\n\nNot only is the majority of training in today\u2019s companies ineffective, but the\npurpose, timing, and content of training is flawed.\n\n**Learning for the Wrong Reasons**\n\n[Bryan Caplan](https://www.futuresquared.xyz/podcast/episode-222-the-case-\nagainst-education-with-bryan-caplan), professor of economics at George Mason\nUniversity, and author of [_The Case Against\nEducation_](https://www.amazon.com/Case-against-Education-System-\nWaste/dp/0691174652) _,_ says in his book that education often isn\u2019t so much\nabout learning useful job skills, but about people showing off, or\n\u201csignaling.\u201d\n\n#### Insight Center\n\n  * ###### [The Future of Education](/insight-center/the-future-of-education)\n\nSponsored by Qatar Foundation\n\nPreparing the next generation of leaders.\n\nToday\u2019s employees often signal through continuous professional education (CPE)\ncredits so that they can make a case for a promotion. L&D staff also signal\ntheir worth by meeting flawed KPIs, such as the total CPE credits employees\nearn, rather than focusing on the business impact created. The former is\neasier to measure, but flawed incentives beget flawed outcomes, such as the\nfollowing:\n\n**We\u2019re learning at the wrong time.** People learn best when they _have_ to\nlearn. Applying what\u2019s learned to real-world situations strengthens one\u2019s\nfocus and determination to learn. And while psychologist Edwin Locke showed\nthe impact of short feedback loops back in 1968 with his [theory of\nmotivation](https://wikispaces.psu.edu/display/PSYCH484/Goal+Setting+Case+Study),\nit\u2019s still not widely practiced when it comes to corporate training. Today\u2019s\nemployees often learn uniform topics, on L&D\u2019s schedule, and at a time when it\nbears little immediate relevance to their role \u2014 and their learning suffers as\na result.\n\n**We\u2019re learning the wrong things.** Want to see eyes glaze over quicker than\nyou can finish this sentence? Mandate that busy employees attend a training\nsession on \u201cbusiness writing skills\u201d, or \u201cconflict resolution\u201d, or some other\nsuch course with little alignment to their needs.\n\n**We quickly forget what we\u2019ve learned.** Like first year college students who\nforget [60% of what they learn in high\nschool](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/06/140625101659.htm),\nstudying merely to get the CPE credit suggests that employees, too, will\nquickly forget what they learn. German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus\npioneered experimental studies of memory in the late 19th Century, culminating\nwith his discovery of [\u201cThe Forgetting\nCurve.\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) He found that if new\ninformation isn\u2019t applied, we\u2019ll forget about 75% of it after just six days.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/09/W190812_GLAVESKI_THEFORGETTING.png)\n\nFind this and other HBR graphics in our  \n[Visual Library __](/visual-library/2019/10/the-forgetting-curve)\n\n**Use It or Lose It**  \nWe can blame biology \u2014 and our innate, evolutionary desire for survival \u2014 for\nthe fact that humans quickly forget what we learn. As Matthieu Boisgontier, of\nthe University of British Columbia\u2019s brain behavior lab [put\nit](https://news.ubc.ca/2018/09/18/hardwired-for-laziness-tests-show-the-\nhuman-brain-must-work-hard-to-avoid-sloth/), \u201cConserving energy has been\nessential for humans\u2019 survival, as it allowed us to be more efficient in\nsearching for food and shelter, competing for sexual partners, and avoiding\npredators.\u201d As a result, our brains quickly forget what we don\u2019t use.\nIncorporating new learning into your work is one way to retain knowledge.\nAnother is spaced repetition. [Originally\nproposed](https://www.irisreading.com/spaced-repetition-and-improved-memory/)\nby psychologist [Cecil Alec Mace ](https://www.amazon.com/psychology-study-\nCecil-Alec-Mace/dp/B0000CO91S)in 1932, it refers to spreading learning out\nover time (material should be reviewed in gradually increasing intervals of\nroughly one day, two days, four days, eight days, and so on). This approach\ntakes advantage of the psychological [spacing effect,\n](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23359223)which demonstrates a strong link\nbetween the periodic exposure to information and retention. Studies show that\nby using spaced repetition, we can [remember about\n80%](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292151229_Using_a_Spaced-\nRepetition-Based_Mobile_Learning_Game_in_Database_Lectures) of what we learn\nafter 60 days \u2014 a significant improvement.\n\nSadly, most L&D programs overlook these biological realities and invest\nbillions of dollars into what amounts to transfers of quickly forgotten\ninformation.\n\n**What needs to change**\n\nToday\u2019s fast-moving business landscape calls for organizations and their\npeople to adapt to changing circumstances rapidly, and to always be learning.\nAs _Wired_ co-founder Kevin Kelly puts it, [\u201cGet good at beginner mode, asking\ndumb questions, making stupid mistakes, and teaching others what you\nlearn.\u201d](https://www.fastcompany.com/3014443/why-being-an-eternal-newbie-\nleads-to-awesome-work)\n\nLean learning, which pays homage to Toyota\u2019s lean manufacturing system,\nstresses using effort only when it\u2019s needed, improving outcomes, and cutting\nwaste; it\u2019s short, affordable, and provides employees and organizations with\nan immediate capability update.\n\nLean learning is about:\n\n  1. Learning the _core_ of what you need to learn\n  2. Applying it to real-world situations immediately\n  3. Receiving immediate feedback and refining your understanding\n  4. Repeating the cycle\n\nLike lean manufacturing and the lean startup before it, lean learning supports\nthe adaptability that gives organizations a competitive advantage in today\u2019s\nmarket.\n\n**How to Apply Lean Learning**\n\n**Think 80/20**. Tim Ferriss, entrepreneur and author of [_The Four Hour_ book\nseries](https://tim.blog/book-gear/), is an advocate of a lean learning method\nhe calls\n[DiSSSCaFE](https://books.google.com/books?id=1C17DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=Tim+Ferriss+DiSSSCaFE&source=bl&ots=MNGViY9sbC&sig=ACfU3U3WWJ3cD26G0G4_om_Z2jGeXgxfMg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwignNHL-8vkAhVFrp4KHWfiBskQ6AEwD3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=Tim%20Ferriss%20DiSSSCaFE&f=false).\nHe suggests identifying the minimum learnable unit (MLU), and applying the\nPareto Principle. If you want to learn Japanese, focus on the 20% of words and\nphrases that show up 80% of the time. Then apply what you learn in actual\nconversations with Japanese speakers as frequently as needed.\n\n**Apply learning to real-world situations**. At [Collective\nCampus](http://www.collectivecampus.io/), we don\u2019t just teach executives a\nspecific innovation methodology. We first ensure that they can actually apply\nthe methodology internally, and we request that they bring real-world projects\nto workshops so that we can apply what\u2019s learned in real-time, shorten the\nfeedback loop, deliver business outcomes, and encourage \u201caha\u201d moments.\n\n**Leverage guided learning.** Rather than provide training at specific\nintervals, guided learning embeds continuous learning into a live application.\nThink screen pop-ups as-you-go that support rapid, context-sensitive, and\npersonalized learning. This is especially applicable for functional leads,\nemployee on-boarding, cross functional teams, IT, and end-user training.\n\n**Personalize content.** Using today\u2019s technologies, you can personalize\ntraining so that it adapts lessons based on employee performance, tailoring\ncontent to every single employee\u2019s needs, learning style, and delivery method.\n\n**Provide ongoing support.** Providing employees with further support after a\nlearning session via a combination of instant messaging, voice messaging, and\nchatbots ensures that they can apply learning to specific challenges.\n\n**Activate peer learning.** When your employees want to learn a new skill,\nthey typically don\u2019t Google it or refer to your learning management system\n(LMS) first; [55% of them ask a colleague](/2018/11/how-to-help-your-\nemployees-learn-from-each-other). When you account for the fact that humans\ntend to learn as they teach, peer learning offers a way to support rapid,\njust-in-time learning, while strengthening the existing understanding your\nemployees have about concepts. It could be as simple as establishing an online\nmarketplace, or periodic peer learning workshops, to connect employees who are\nwilling to teach specific skills with colleagues who want to acquire such\nskills. Incentivizing peer learning by incorporating it into performance\nreviews can ensure that employees continue to invest time into the program.\n\n**Offer micro courses.** Give employees short, bite-sized learning\nopportunities, which can take the form of digestible, hour-long courses on\ntopics of relevance to an employee\u2019s immediate challenges or opportunities.\n\n**Moving From Credits to Outcomes**\n\nIn order to begin practicing lean learning, organizations need to move from\nmeasuring CPEs earned to measuring business outcomes created.

It can be an especially difficult task if you are processing\nexpenses from multiple employees from different divisions and entities.\n\nDelaying the payment of expenses not only leads to cash flow confusion, it\nalso negatively affects staff morale. Without a proper system in place, a\ncompany can become burdened, making it hard to establish an audit trail if\nexpenses aren\u2019t processed timely.\n\nThankfully, technology makes the function much easier, taking the hassle away\nfrom employers.\n\nHRM Asia\u2019s Readers Choice Awards recognise the best expense management system\ntechnology available to the HR profession in this part of the world. Having\nexceptional expense management software helps an employer keep track of its\nemployees\u2019 spending, and how they pay for those items.\n\nThe Gold winner in the Best HR Tech \u2013 Expenses Management category was this\nyear won by Times Software.\n\nRene Wong, Senior Sales and Marketing Manager of Times Software, said: \u201cWe\nbelieve our HR Solutions\u2019 robustness, flexibility, data security, high\navailability, ease of use, and cost effectiveness backed by our excellent\ncustomer service were the key drivers that helped us achieved this win\u2019\u2019.\n\nWhat makes Times Software stand out as a brand in this category is that it is\na privately-owned, homegrown company with a strong local and international\npresence. \u201cWhen we \u2018Think Global\u2019 we \u2018Act Local\u2019 and we understand the needs\nand trends of the local market,\u2019\u2019 added Wong.\n\nTimes Software combines more than 20 years of experience in the human\nresource, information technology and finance sectors. This helps it produce\nquality HR solutions that can cater to the needs of its clients from all\nindustries, not just in Singapore but from around the region.\n\nLooking ahead to 2020 for the organisation in 2020, Times Software says it has\nsomething big coming! \u201cA whole range of products that use the next level of\ntechnology. We are excited about this and we can\u2019t wait to share with everyone\nwhen it arrives,\u2019\u2019 added Wong.\n\nSumming up what winning means, Wong said: \u201cWe would like to thank HRM Asia for\nthis prestigious award. It is a great honour to us for win and it motivates us\nto go further beyond what\u2019s possible in making great HR products and\ndelivering great services to all companies here in Singapore and beyond.\u201d\n\n**Times Software**\n\nTimes Software Pte Ltd is a privately owned, home-grown company, incorporated\nin 1998.\n\nAs the industry leader with many years of experience in the HR, information\ntechnology and finance sectors, we continuously achieve our mission to provide\nexcellent products and services to cater to the needs of our clients from all\nindustries.\n\nOur core products are our comprehensive suite of award-winning TIMES Payroll\nand cloud enabled HRIS applications.

just doesn\u2019t correspond with professional purposes.\n\nWe researched different ways to improve employee training when implementing\nlearning software into your company\u2019s

Some people learn\nbetter by reading while others by watching webinars or tutorials. One employee\nmight prefer to dive deeply into the matter, while another needs to get a\ngeneral understanding of the subject first. As you may see, it depends on\npersonality factors, and these differences can be critical for determining the\nprocess efficiency.\n\nHR managers should take this [variety of learning\napproaches](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/employee-training-program-lms/)\ninto account by:\n\n    * Offering a possibility to get the information via different mediums. If you create a video guide for your employees, make sure to provide them with a transcript. Some people will want to review the information in the printed form or will simply have no time to listen to the entire video. \n    * Adapting to different speeds. The YouTube speed modification feature corresponds to these needs perfectly. Some people will prefer to slow things down, listening to the file on 0.75 speed, while others will put it on 1.5 speed because it helps them to keep focus. Again, both methods are valid -- you just need to provide access to this customization.\n    * Experimenting with formatting. Some people like their study material to be color-coded, while others prefer a typical bold-italic combination. It\u2019s best if the platform allows team members to highlight information in whichever way they find fitting.\n\nThe key to providing a blended approach is flexibility. Don\u2019t insist on a\nsingle learning framework -- it won\u2019t work for everyone. Instead, start by\ninterviewing your team members and learn more about their studying\npreferences.\n\n## Provide relevant and tailored content\n\nPersonalization is essential to effective learning. An employee should be\nfully aware of how this information or skill will contribute specifically to\nthe workflow or individual progress. This includes a possibility to customize\nthe curriculum, remove or add topics and change the order of the subjects at\nthe mentor\u2019s discretion.\n\nThese aspects seem obvious at first glance, but it\u2019s also something that the\nmajority of companies neglect. The Deloitte report on the learning management\nsystem shows that only 3% of companies recognize personalization as a crucial\naspect of their employees\u2019 development.\n\nThis aspect is especially valuable for Millennials -- for them, training and\ndevelopment are the most important choice criteria when it comes to selecting\na workplace. Yes, it\u2019s even more important than bonuses and flexibility.\n\nStrive to assist your employees in their self-development as well as a\ncorporate one. Not everything they learn in the office should be connected to\nthe company. Employees should feel that they are growing as individuals, not\njust as a part of the system.\n\n## Take learner analytics seriously\n\nWith such a diverse and customizable approach to learning, it might naturally\nbe challenging for employers to keep track of the process efficiency. Since\nimplementing professional [learning software is an\ninvestment](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/lms-learning-management-\nsystem/), it\u2019s only natural that you should know your returns.\n\nBefore starting to determine KPIs, employees need to focus on building an\nalgorithm. Basically, you need to unite all used mediums and approaches in the\nsingle framework. All learning content can be divided into two large groups:\n\n    * In-house learning. These are the activities that teams perform together and on a mandatory basis. You need to define what kinds of knowledge or skills you want to develop and put these out for the discussion. The results include getting certification and badges, employee activity increases and higher-quality of shared experiences. \n    * Recommendations. These include non-mandatory learning activities that might happen in the workplace or outside. A training specialist should regularly share books, tools, courses, reports, blogs, personalities and videos. They shouldn\u2019t directly concern the company\u2019s goals and tasks, but they should generally contribute to employees\u2019 personal development. \n\nIn learning software, you can track both kinds of interactions. The employees\ncan leave reviews and rate the content, as well as recommend suggested sources\nto other team members. Also, you can see how the learned information relates\nto the employee\u2019s skills and the company\u2019s tasks. On top of that, you can\ncreate regular reports that summarize your team\u2019s learning progress.\n\n## Include soft skills training\n\nFocusing on hard skills is a common mistake of many companies that start to\nexplore learning. The roots of the problem are clear -- such skills are easier\nto measure, and you feel the progress right away. However, this short-term\nsystem doesn\u2019t correspond with the market\u2019s realities. Now both end-users and\ncompanies seek professionals who have high communication, teamwork and\nproblem-solving competences.\n\nSource: [LinkedIn Global\nTrends](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-2019-talent-trends-soft-\nskills-transparency-trust-bersin/)\n\nThe major advantage of soft skills is that they are universal and can be used\nin any kind of project. If you need your employees to shift to a different\nfield, there will likely be a need to relearn hard skills, but soft skills\nwill be useful in any kind of situation.\n\nBusiness owners and HR managers often complain that soft skills are hard to\nmeasure. However, there are AI-based analysis tools -- like Koru or Pymetrics\n-- that use language recognition and behavioral patterns to assess employee\u2019s\nprogress in communication, teamwork, self-discipline and others. Additionally,\nsoft skills can be evaluated with the help of interviews, tests and constant\nmonitoring.\n\n## Reward and recognize training achievements\n\nThe final learning step is appreciation and gratification. Learning should be\nrecognized by the team and management as hard work and rewarded accordingly.\nThere is an important distinction to make here -- by rewards, we don\u2019t\nnecessarily mean monetary bonuses. You can reward diligent learners by\nproviding them better learning opportunities.\n\nPossible incentives can include:\n\n    * Tickets to professional conferences. A company should sponsor participation in educational events at least for its most competent employees. It\u2019s great if a company has financial opportunities to sponsor a trip to an international event -- such practices hugely contribute to the company\u2019s reputation among clients, partners and potential employees.\n    * New learning material. You can provide successful learners with in-depth courses or find them a mentor. The only thing to remember here is that these new opportunities should be seen as an upgrade, compared to the possibilities, provided before.\n    * More responsibility. For competitive and driven Millennials, it\u2019s important when employers put their trust in them and increase their work competences. In addition to that, you should reflect on these changes in monetary bonuses so that each team member will feel appreciated and valued. \n\nIt\u2019s important to always think one step forward. Don\u2019t strive to offer your\nemployees the best possible learning experience right away, instead, take some\ntime to provide accessible solutions, and offer upgraded opportunities to the\nmost interested individuals.\n\nSource: [Towards Maturity Report On Corporate\nEducation](https://www.towardsmaturity.org/elements/uploads/Unlocking_Potential_-\n_Digital.pdf)\n\nWith learning software, managing these education opportunities is much easier,\nsince you always have clear statistics and flexible filters.\n\n## The bottom line\n\nLearning software provides companies with access to detailed plans, pre-made\nlearning templates, interactive video, audio and text platforms, and\npersonalized curriculum. You will have a customized learning platform that\nfits your companies\u2019 needs and takes the personal differences of your\nemployees into account.\n\nImplementing continuous learning in the workplace requires a systematic\napproach above all. You need to have a clear strategy in mind and understand\nthe end goals. All skills and knowledge should fall into a single framework\nand support the company\u2019s vision and values. With learning software, not only\ncan you organize all learning materials, statistics and suggestions into a\nsingle platform, but you will also know exactly what your team accomplished.\n\n![Andrey Davidov, Ph.D., HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Andrey\nDavidov, Ph.D., HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Andrey\nDavidov, Ph.D., HR Expert Contributor](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/AndreyDavidov-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Andrey Davidov, Ph.D., HR Expert\nContributor](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/andreydavidovhrmorning-com/)\n\nAndrey Davidov, Ph.D. is co-Founder & CEO at [DDI Development](https://ddi-\ndev.com/), software development and UX/UI designers team.

source LMS trend, led by industry pioneers such as Moodle, has\ndominated e-learning in the last few years. However, many organizations still\nswear by proprietary LMS and its advantages over open source LMS. We assess\nthese two options and look at the factors you should consider before making a\ndecision._**\n\nOn the surface, open source Learn Management Systems (LMS) can appear to be an\nattractive value proposition, especially for small to mid-sized businesses\n(SMBs). You can get started with zero upfront costs, scale as necessary,\ncustomize as required, and easily transfer content without any vendor lock-in.\nHowever, open source LMS comes with a few critical disadvantages which are\noften swept under the rug \u2013 hosting is still done on-premise/cloud which means\nyou are spending heavily on storage. Also, open source LMS assumes a level of\ntechnical know-how which may be missing in your organization. **Learn more:**\n**[What is a Learning Management System\n(LMS)?](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\na-learning-management-system-lms/)**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nSo, is it better to invest in a proprietary LMS which promises long term\nsupport and quick implementation? Or, is a cost-optimized, customizable open\nsource LMS the best-fit for you? Today, we discuss these questions in greater\ndetail so you could take the right call.\n\n## What is an Open Source LMS?\n\nThe simplest example of open source versus proprietary environments is that of\nAndroid and Apple. The Android environment lets you configure your own\napplication and you are free to run any compatible software (with an APK\nextension). Apple, on the other hand, requires developers to get their\napplication ratified, ensure that strict guidelines are met, and make software\navailable on a marketplace controlled by Apple, before deploying.\n\nOpen source LMS works in the same way: there are popular open source LMS tools\nout there such as Moodle, which give you all the features to be programmed and\nimplemented as per requirement. [Proprietary\nLMS](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/learning-\nmanagement-systems-to-look-out-for/) requires zero technical efforts and\nincludes support throughout the software\u2019s lifecycle. Of course, there is a\ncost component involved.\n\n## Three Benefits of an Open Source LMS\n\nIf you are considering an open source LMS for your organization, keep in mind\nthese possible benefits:\n\n  1. Highly customizable - Courses can be designed as per the unique objectives of your company, even according to specific quarterly targets or departmental needs. From navigation to UI, it is entirely in your hands, and you have full control over the content without being apprehensive about underlying features being changed/discontinued.  \n\n  2. Completely secure - In the post GDPR world, data privacy is a major concern for every organization, particularly those dealing with customer data. An open source LMS means that the hosted information never crosses enterprise borders, customer information can be ported into the platform to help learners, and compliance is maintained as per organizational policies.  \n\n  3. Timely updates - A proprietary LMS vendor will follow their own update schedule, and this may not be in sync with your requirements. Typically, you are left requesting a feature, following change logs, and waiting for the implementation to arrive. With open source LMS on the other hand, you can prioritize development activities and keep the platform running in alignment with your business targets.\n\n  \nDespite these benefits, however, several organizations swear by their favorite\nproprietary LMS solutions \u2013 here\u2019s why.\n\nLearn more: [Choosing an LMS \u2013 Cloud or\nHosted?](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/choosing-an-lms-cloud-or-hosted/)\n\n## The Hidden Costs of Open Source LMS\n\nOpen source LMS doesn\u2019t always imply \u201cfree of cost\u201d. You will have to allocate\nfunds and efforts towards setting up the platform, arranging storage areas\n(server hardware or rented cloud), and keeping IT personnel in place to run\nthe system. Also, leading open source LMS options like Moodle offer at least\ntwo stable upgrades every year, calling for an additional round of\ndevelopment.\n\nBefore taking the plunge and deciding to adopt open source LMS (and going to\nall the trouble of transferring your precious content), keep these factors in\nmind. If the benefits outweigh the costs, there are a few highly acclaimed\nopen source LMS options available \u2013 including Moodle.\n\n## The Bottomline \u2013 Is Open Source LMS for you?\n\nAt the end of the day, the decision comes down to your organizational priority\nand workforce composition. If technical expertise is present in-house then\nchoosing open source LMS makes a lot of sense, containing costs, pushing\nadaptability, and unlocking new ways to innovate for your e-learning\ninitiatives. On the other hand, without the requisite technical talent,\npartnering with an open source LMS expert is just an additional (and often\npreventable overhead).

If the members of this\nteam are overwhelmed or don't have the resources they need to perform their\njobs, the entire organization will suffer. Fortunately, such a thing as HRIS\nsystems exists.\n\n**What are the types of HRIS systems?**  \nHuman resource information system (HRIS) refers to a software solution used in\nmanaging employees and in the procedures for keeping them engaged and\nproductive. HRIS systems typically fall into two categories, according to\nMitrefinch:\n\n**HCM**  \nThe systems that fall under the human capital management (HCM) category are\naimed at recruiting and retaining employees throughout their life cycle. They\ncan include anything from recruitment and onboarding tools to salary planning,\nbudgeting, goal-setting, and performance assessment. These tools assist the HR\nteam in guiding employees toward success.\n\nAnalytics are also an integral part of HCM solutions and can be useful in\ntracking employee red flags and predicting growth potential. These solutions\ntend to be more detailed than HRMS solutions and are often used in an\nexecutive-type white-collar setting.\n\n**HRMS**  \nHuman resource management systems (HRMS) may contain some elements of HCM\nsolutions, but they also have several tools to help employees as well. These\ninclude an efficient and flexible way for workers to clock in and out, manage\ntheir schedules, and easily communicate with colleagues even if they are\nworking remotely.\n\nOn the HR side, these solutions can be integrated into payroll and onboarding\nprocesses to make tasks easier for the HR team. They can also lessen the\nnumber of mistakes and improve the oversight that can be made with a manual\nprocess.\n\n**What are the components of HRIS systems?**  \nHRIS typically has six components, according to Bizfluent:\n\n**Company database**  \nAn essential HRIS system component is a database where all pieces of\ninformation about employees and company HR procedures will be stored for use\nin other HRIS tools. Aside from conveniently storing all data in a central\nlocation for easy access, this database comes with features to keep your data\nsecure, updated, and free from corruption.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\nAutomated backups are a common feature that HRIS systems use to prevent data\nloss. Often, there's also access to technical support in case you have trouble\naccessing your data or experience an emergency.\n\n**Financial components**  \nHRIS also includes components for handling payroll, benefits, and employee\nrecognition programs. The payroll and benefits components will maintain\ninformation such as salary rates, commission and incentive plans, payment\naccounts, and paycheck deductions (e.g., taxes, retirement plans, and\ninsurance options).\n\nUsually, there are options to automate payouts, calculate taxes, and enroll in\nbenefits. If your organization rewards employees with bonuses or gift cards\nfor great work, financial components have reporting tools that can help\ndetermine these rewards.\n\n**Time and attendance**  \nAnother key HRIS component helps with keeping track of the time during which\nemployees work and any incidents of absence or tardiness. Such information can\nbe sent to the financial components to ensure that employees are paid fairly.\n\nAlso, these tools can automate employee scheduling, send managers alerts when\nattendance problems occur, and allow for documentation of time off and\nextended leave requests. Some systems even make it possible for employees to\nclock in remotely and support biometrics options.\n\n**Recruitment and onboarding**  \nHRIS systems come with components that ease the work done throughout the\nhiring process, including posting job applications, handling employee\nreferrals, sending interview requests, and tracking applicants. Often, you can\naccess applicant profiles, record notes from job interviews, conduct\nemployment tests, perform background checks, and send job-offer letters.\n\nOnce employees are hired, there are tools that can automate onboarding\nactivities such as document signing, new employee record keeping, and\ncompliance administration.\n\n**Employee management**  \nYou can use this component to track employee performance, make changes to\nemployees' personal information, document feedback from performance reviews,\nand maintain information about salary, benefits, and disciplinary history.\n\n**Training and development**  \nMost HRIS systems provide an option to design a training path for employees\nand even integrate training courses, tests, and professional certification\npreparation in a portal that employees can easily access. They also record\nemployees' progress and can even use work performance metrics to check whether\nthe training has helped employees improve and assign additional training\nexercises as needed.\n\nSince these tools can support employee ranking, they come in handy when\nconsidering which workers to promote. It's particularly helpful when deciding\nabout succession planning within your organization.\n\n**What are the benefits of HRIS systems?**  \nHere are four ways your organization can benefit from an HRIS, according to\nNamely:\n\n**Employee self-service**  \nAn HRIS stores all your company policies, benefits information, and company\nresources in one accessible location, so employees know exactly where to look\nfor the answers to all their questions. They can connect with colleagues,\nrequest time off, enroll in benefits, and check paystubs on demand from their\nlaptops and mobile devices without interrupting you.\n\n**Centralized employee communication**  \nInternal messages can get lost easily. An HRIS can act as the central hub for\nyour organization's internal communications. Modern HR systems offer a\nnewsfeed where the HR team can post announcements, recognize outstanding\nemployees, and share updates. The platform can also boost employee engagement\nby acknowledging employee birthdays, start dates, and work anniversaries.\n\n**Increased HR automation**  \nAs your organization grows, your time might be better spent on strategic\ninitiatives - not day-to-day administrative tasks. An HRIS can help streamline\nyour daily tasks by automating simple processes such as overseeing employee\nonboarding, benefits enrollment, and tax forms - giving you time to manage\nyour employees and focus on your team's initiatives.\n\n**Powerful people insights**  \nUsing an HRIS enables you to make more strategic decisions. By storing all\nyour company and employee data in one place, you get a more holistic view of\nyour organization and can better identify areas for improvement. Aside from\nHR, payroll and benefits, HR software typically offers powerful integrations\nwith other point solutions to move data seamlessly between systems. Using your\nHR data through consistent reporting not only helps your organization achieve\nits business goals but also empowers you to make more informed decisions and\nprove impact.\n\n**How much is an HRIS system?**  \nHRIS costs can vary from as low as $1 per month per employee to thousands of\ndollars a year. As for huge enterprise HRMS systems like PeopleSoft, SAP,\nSage, and Workday, they may cost larger firms thousands or even millions of\ndollars to implement. Fortunately, newer cloud-based HR software fills the gap\nfor small businesses by offering online HRMS systems that allow employers to\npay by employee or contractor (user) with no setup fee, with price ranging\nfrom about $1 to $15 per month per employee.\n\nWhen choosing an HRIS, these are the costs that you should consider, according\nto FitSmallBusiness:\n\n  * Software - HR software for small business costs between $1 and $15 per month per employee. Some firms add monthly fees, while others provide only the basics.\n  * Setup fees - These are used to pay for the time of configuring the software to a company. Price ranges from zero to thousands per year, depending on the vendor.\n  * Consulting fees - These vary from zero (if included in your software subscription) to about $150 per hour if you seek the help of an outside HR consultant.\n  * Support fees - Some HRMS software companies charge additional support fees that may run a few hundred dollars per year.\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily

right\ndirection. But given the advanced analytics functions now available on LMS\nplatforms, and the opportunity to integrate other HR data sources while\nmeasuring your learning metrics, this space can be hard to navigate. In this\narticle, we decode how to measure the success of your learning and development\nprograms, and share which four metrics can help with this._**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nOften, it can be difficult for HR practitioners to measure if their L&D;\nprograms are working. Unlike marketing or sales, there are fewer numbers to\nreaffirm your program\u2019s efficacy. As a result, you could be investing in\nineffective L&D; tracks \u2013 or struggling to gain buy-in from the C-Suite,\nbecause you couldn\u2019t demonstrate measurable ROI.\n\nThis is why it is so critical to deploy L&D; analytics in parallel with your\nlearning programs. These analytics uncover valuable insights into\nparticipation rates, progress trends, the number of completed certifications,\ndrop-off areas, and missing links in your L&D; framework.\n\nBut unless you know exactly what to look for, it's easy to get lost in the\nlabyrinth of learning metrics, building exhaustive reports that fall short of\nvalue generation.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to first identify your learning and development\ngoals and link back analytics data for valuable insights.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **The Employee Training Makeover You Can\u2019t Afford to\nSkip**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/the-\nemployee-training-makeover-you-cant-afford-to-skip/)\n\n## **What Does Data Analytics Mean in the Context of L &D;**\n\nAnalytics is the first step towards getting visibility into the metrics you\nwant to measure.\n\nIn the context of L&D;, analytics takes the vast data sets available in your\nLMS and applies a layer of analysis and visualization to highlight key\nmetrics. This could include:\n\n  * Which training sessions have been completed \n  * Which teams have completed a specific\n  * How employees consume different types of L&D; content \n  * Courses that have been taken more than once\n\n  \nIf you\u2019re applying analytics to L&D;, there are few [learning\nmetrics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/digital-\nlearning-metrics-you-should-measure/) to watch out for. Of course, this will\nvary according to the nature of your business and its unique requirements. For\nexample, increased positive customer feedback is an excellent indicator of\nlearning effectiveness (and an easy-to-measure metric) if you\u2019re responsible\nfor a contact center.\n\nBut apart from these company-specific nuances, your [L&D; analytics\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/the-top-\nlearning-development-questions-solved-by-analytics/)and measurement model\nshould be centered on four key learning metrics.\n\n**Learn More:[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/five-key-\nlms-trends-2019/)**\n\n## **Measure these 4 Metrics to Evaluate L &D; Success**\n\nIn addition to standard analytics data such as course completion rates and\npace of competition, there could be other vital areas that are being ignored.\nHere are four learning metrics, as described by Ashish Rangnekar, co-founder\nand CEO of [BenchPrep](http://benchprep.com), an advanced online learning\nprogram for professional education and certification organizations, directly\nlinked to the impact of your L&D; program.\n\n### **1\\. The cold, hard cost of training your employees**\n\n  \nDid you know that per-employee training investment is a clear marker of your\npast program\u2019s efficacy? Organizations often tend to train the same employees\nfor the same skill sets.\n\nUnless your workplace is witnessing sweeping changes, the cost of L&D; per\nemployee should remain stable. It is not advisable to blindly invest simply\nbecause you have detected a skills gap. If you have provided the same training\nbefore, this could mean that the solution isn't working as expected.\n\nMake costs a vital component in your L&D; analytics dashboard, taking stock of\nchanging spending patterns every month, and realigning your L&D; modules\naccordingly.\n\n### **2\\. A rise \u2013 or a dip \u2013 in operational efficiency**\n\n  \nThis holds true specifically for production-oriented or high-volume\nbusinesses. Your learners should be able to handle higher throughput at work,\nmanaging larger volumes within the same time. That's why this learning metric\nis intertwined with [performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/).\n\nData gathered from performance management systems will indicate how well a\nlearner can apply their newly acquired skill sets in the workplace.\n\nConversely, if the learning program is ineffective or irrelevant to the\nemployee\u2019s daily work schedule, you could even notice a dip in efficiency\nlevels. The learner is distracted from their workday, redirected to training\nin areas that are not relevant to their role. It is essential to nip such\ninstances in the bud, and promptly channel the employee in a different\ndirection.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is a Learning Management System\n(LMS)?](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\na-learning-management-system-lms/)**\n\n### **3\\. Progress for both the company and employee**\n\n  \nL&D; isn\u2019t just meant to benefit your organization. The employee should be\nable to gain a meaningful advantage from undertaking the L&D; course. Look for\nan acceleration in their career progression pathway, movement into cross-\nfunctional roles, and an increase in compensation. HR practitioners often\nignore this aspect of L&D;, considering their job to be over once employees\nhave been certified.\n\nBut that\u2019s not really the case. It\u2019s only when an employee is able to take\ntheir learnings and convert it into a _personal_ value-addition that the\nlearning can be deemed useful.\n\nThe same idea is also applicable at the organizational level. For the dollars\nthat you invest during a particular period in L&D;, you should be able to\nwitness a corresponding jump in revenue.\n\nRemember, this won\u2019t always be in the form of a rising bottom line. Future-\nreadiness, more effortless transformation, and scalability into new areas are\nalso indirect contributors to your revenue.\n\n### **4\\. Your learner\u2019s feedback on the instructor**\n\n  \nAsk your employees to regularly evaluate their instructors as well as the\nsoftware they are using. This learning metric will indicate how satisfied your\nlearners are with the L&D; experience.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that learning in the workplace should be fun and\nengaging \u2013 not just another responsibility on a person\u2019s work schedule. That\u2019s\nwhy methodologies like [gamification in\nlearning](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/why-2019-will-be-the-year-of-gamification-in-corporate-learning/)\nare becoming so popular, reinventing the learning process with clear\nincentives and drivers. Leverage [pulse surveys\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/pulse-surveys-\nvs-annual-surveys-which-is-a-better-measure-of-employee-engagement/)after\nevery L&D; track to understand if such interventions are necessary.\n\n**Learn More:** **[A Career in Learning and Development: 10 Must-Have Skills\nto Make It Big in 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/skills-for-a-career-in-learning-and-development/)**\n\n## **Getting Started with Learning Metrics \u2013 The Way Forward**\n\nFortunately, most LMS solutions come with built-in analytics to answer common\nquestions around L&D; effectiveness. However, to gain a holistic picture of\nemployee development, you need to integrate L&D; analytics with your broader\nHR data landscape. Performance management, retention/attrition rates,\ncompensation, and employee engagement all have a role to play.\n\nHere\u2019s what we recommend:\n\n  * Take stock of your organizational goals and identify which metrics (learning as well as other areas) are contributing factors.\n  * Integrate your data sources, keeping an eye on [data quality](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/6-questions-you-need-to-ask-about-your-hr-data-quality/).\n  * Apply a visualization layer to create a comprehensive overview.\n  * Realign L&D; as per the learning metrics mentioned above, and review the results using analytics.\n\n  \nL&D; is a critical component when offering employees a refreshed value\nproposition. So, you must ensure that any L&D; program reaches its intended\ngoal without becoming part of the organizational \u201cwhite noise.\u201d\n\nYour best bet to making this happen is to link L&D; with clear learning\nmetrics \u2013 numbers, graphical representations, dashboards, and razor-sharp\ninsights, which leave no room for conjecture or abstraction.\n\nThese metrics are your secret weapon to ensure that L&D; programs are accepted\nand appreciated by both employee and employer.\n\n_Which are the top Learning & Development metrics that you measure at your\ncompany? __Let us know on_[\n_Facebook_](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist/) _,_[\n_LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-technologist/) _, or_[\n_Twitter_](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist?lang=en?) _.

One of the areas sometimes overlooked is\ntime and attendance of employees. But this can be a big mistake, as it can\nlead to lower growth and productivity.\n\nThere are new, automated systems that offer a range of new features to help\nyou keep track of time and attendance.\n\nWhile sales are important, employers also need to understand the importance of\nhaving modern and efficient systems that allow HR and other internal teams to\nrun effectively. The HRM Asia 2019 Readers Choice Awards recognises those HR\nvendors who have the best tech when it comes to time and attendance management\nsystems.\n\nScooping our Gold Award this year was BIPO Service.

(\u201cPaycom\u201d)(NYSE: PAYC), a leading provider of comprehensive,\ncloud-based human capital management software, today announced the rollout of\nits proprietary Performance Evidence and Video Content Creator, two\nenhancements to its learning management platform, Paycom Learning.\n\n> \u201cI am excited about these developments to Paycom Learning as we continue to\n> add value for our clients and put HR technology in the hands of their\n> employees,\u201d said Chad Richison, Paycom\u2019s founder and CEO. \u201cWe understand the\n> impact learning and development programs can have on a company\u2019s overall\n> strategy and growth, and these two features bring a whole new approach to\n> how companies can implement, measure and report on key initiatives.\u201d\n\nA 2019 PricewaterhouseCoopers study reveals one of CEOs\u2019 top three concerns is\nthe unavailability of key skills in the workforce, which threatens business\ngrowth. As companies continue to struggle through talent shortages driven by\nskills deficiencies, Paycom\u2019s Performance Evidence and Video Content Creator\ncan help organizations develop their workforce to meet rapidly evolving\nbusiness needs.\n\nWith Performance Evidence, clients can create a lesson tool that allows their\nemployees to demonstrate knowledge and mastery of a specific skill to confirm\nthey are truly grasping the course material. Managers or trainers then can\nprovide direct input about the employee\u2019s performance, creating a true\nfeedback loop that promotes employee development.\n\nAdditionally, the Video Content Creator allows subject-matter experts to share\nknowledge across the company by empowering them to create, upload and\ndistribute engaging microlearning content quickly and easily. Clients can\nsimply grant access to the appropriate individuals by enabling the feature in\ntheir user profile. The user can then record their own training video, upload\nit into the system in their preferred video file type, and add accompanying\nmaterials and questions to test the viewer\u2019s knowledge.\n\nAnd there\u2019s good reason why eight out of 10 learning and development\nprofessionals favor microlearning. Research from the _Journal of Applied\nPsychology_ reveals the approach is more efficient than traditional courses\nand improves the knowledge transfer by 17%, meaning newly learned skills are\nmore likely to be retained and used in the workplace.\n\nBoth Paycom Learning enhancements provide clients with a number of\ncustomization tools that address access, time restrictions, reporting\ncapabilities and much more. These new features come on the heels of other\nmajor 2019 developments like Ask Here\u2122 and Direct Data Exchange\u2122, as Paycom\ncontinues to advance its focus to drive ROI for its clients.\n\n**About Paycom**\n\nAs a leader in payroll and HR technology, Oklahoma City-based Paycom redefines\nthe human capital management industry by allowing companies to effectively\nnavigate a rapidly changing business environment.

This edition of\nAI in Learning and Development will provide you with an understanding of the\nkey applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in driving learning and\ntraining initiatives, creating a culture of learning, boosting productivity\nand morale and elevating the employee experience. You will also learn about\nthe key features, use-cases, and questions to ask before investing in an AI-\npowered learning management system.**_\n\n## **Table of Contents**\n\n  * _**An Introduction to L&D; Today**_\n  * _**5 Use-cases of AI in L&D;**_\n  * _**Choosing the Right LMS**_\n  * _**Through the Looking Glass: What does the future hold for AI in L&D;?**_\n\n\n\n## **An Introduction to L &D; Today**\n\nBefore we deep dive into the latest trends in the organizational learning and\ndevelopment space, before we take stock of the changes that have been making\nus question and reinvent learning as we know it and before we analyze how to\nchoose the right [learning management system (LMS)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-a-\nlearning-management-system-lms/)for our unique needs, let us acknowledge what\nlies at the heart of every learning process: adaptation.\n\nHow adaptive an organization is today, determines how well it can thrive (and\nnot merely survive) in the years to come. **Going back to the basics, it\nalways helps to remember that learning is a relatively permanent change in\nbehavior that is brought about by experience and maintained through practice.\nThe operational phrase to pay heed to in that definition is \" _relatively_\npermanent\".** It presupposes a certain level of dynamism and fluidity - of\nchange and possibilities. This holds true especially in our present times\nwhere stagnation and complacency have no room given the pace of change!\n\n**Hawley Kane, Head of Organizational Talent and Leadership Development at\nSaba Software** talked to HRT about the biggest trend to watch out for in L&D;\ntoday and said \"Hands down we see the connection of learning to performance as\nbeing the a-ha moment for L&D.; Here's the crux of it: **For high-performing\norganizations, learning is not the outcome - it is the behavior that drives\nperformance**.\" She clarifies that learning and performance management do not\nmerely co-exist - they are dependent on one another. Thus, to deliver learning\nexperiences that move the needle on performance, talent leaders need to\nempower employees to drive their own development with learning that is aligned\nto individual, team and business goals.\n\nHawley adds, \"By thinking in terms of business outcomes and focusing L&D;\nprograms on specific behaviors, skills, or competencies, you can solidify the\nlearning-performance connection to achieve the results that matter to your\nbusiness.\"\n\nTo talk about L&D; today without mentioning the impact of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), would be a hollow discussion. The\nimpact of technology on learning is crucial since it works in a loop -\nlearning and technology power each other.\n\n## **5 Use Cases of AI in L &D;**\n\nThe evolution of learning and the advancement of technology go hand-in-hand\nand this interdependence demands that we look at the impact of technology on\norganizational learning today, and the [use-cases of AI in L&D; to understand\nhow learning processes have been\ntransformed](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/3-ways-ai-will-transform-learning-and-development/) and improved.\n\n![5 Use Cases of AI in L&D](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\nLet's look at the five major use-cases of AI in organizational learning and\ndevelopment.\n\n### **1\\. Deeper, Wider Analytics**\n\n  \nWith AI, L&D; managers can make better sense of the data dump that comes with\nall digital workplaces.  Deep data analysis creates new avenues for\nreassessment and redesign of courses with far greater precision. Data can thus\nbecome more than simply a repository and be looked at as a tool for\ntransformation. AI tools can help access depths of data not explored before\nwhile also enabling the organization to navigate widths that could otherwise\nbe impossible. A recent Gartner report claims that by 2020, AI will create 2.3\nmillion jobs while making1.8 million roles redundant. In an environment as\ncharged with change as that, data cannot be a mere fallback but rather, the\ntreasure of information needs to be the building blocks on which a culture of\ncontinuous change can be built. **AI-powered learning processes could thus be\nmined as the missing link between employee engagement, workforce productivity,\nand business profitability.**\n\n### **2\\. Real-time Artificial Mentoring**\n\n  \nWith AI, learning modules can now be a lot more interactive and powered by\nnatural communication. Conversational bots and engaging interfaces can\ntransform learning by making employees feel a lot more in the loop. AI\nteaching assistants enable trainers in interacting with a wider employee base\nwhile still adhering to each employee individually. Learning Management\nSystems (LMS) can, therefore, be made more responsive and the quality of\nanswers to queries improved. It is thus no wonder that digital tutors that can\nengage with employees in real-time are quackly gaining in popularity.\n**Artificial mentors come with the very real benefits of a much more engaging\nlearning experience.**\n\nRead Full Article __\n\n##### Enter your email address to unlock the full article\n\n__\n\n  I accept the [terms conditions](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/terms-of-\nuse/) and [privacy policy](https://www.ziffdavis.com/privacy-policy/).\n\n### **3\\. Augmented Content**\n\n  \nWith the format of basic [learning and\ndevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/what-is-learning-and-development-objectives-strategy/) processes\nhaving undergone an evolution, the content of learning modules need to change\nas well. While creating content with the aid of subject matter experts is\nessential, it could often be time-consuming. AI tools today are capable of\nbeing trained to skim through tons of information, take out the most relevant\npieces of information and stitch it all together in a format that is human-\nreadable. Immersive, virtual reality (VR) enabled content not only engage\nlearners better but also ensure deeper internalization and more effective\napplication of learned skills and behavior. With fresher content created\nfaster, the shelf-life of learning courses can also be extended and while AI\nstill has a ways to go before being able to organically create and curate more\ncomplicated learning programs, the journey has surely begun.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834bf8d52f2.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n### **4\\. Anytime-anywhere Access**\n\n  \nWe live in a world of anytime-anywhere access to information. It is only\nnatural that employees expect the same level of access in learning processes.\nThis not only applies to millennials but to employees at large \u2013 they want to\nbe able to tune into relevant courses on-demand and AI-enabled LMS are making\nthat a reality by being able to track career journeys, map career paths and\npredict learning and skilling needs at each stage of the journey. **In\naddition to individual access, a smart, future-ready LMS system also needs to\ncater to an inherently diverse workforce.** Are the systems available in\ndifferent languages, is the individual context of each employee taken into\nconsideration while tailoring the larger learning programs, how do employees\nwho have visual or auditory constraints interact with and gain from the\ncourses;, and do the L&D; program delivery and outcomes get smarter and better\nover time with AI finding patterns of learning success?\n\n### **5\\. Meaningful Personalization**\n\n  \nAI can help enhance the learning experience by creating personalized content\nand tests that speak to the individual. This goes a lot further than expecting\nyour employees to enjoy a one-size-fits-all training course. From product ads\nthat pop up on our screens to notifications and service suggestions that speak\nspecifically to us, we crave from personalized messages from our environment.\nWith learning too, **AI-enabled platforms that can engage a diverse range of\nemployees are more effective. This allows each employee to be on a meaningful,\npersonalized learning journey while growing collectively.**\n\n## **Choosing the Right LMS**\n\nSelecting the right Learning Management System (LMS) is as crucial to the\nsuccess of the organization as the selection of the right talent. With a\nplethora of options available in a market that is crowded with LMS offerings,\nhow do you ensure that you\u2019re making the right choice? Here\u2019s a step-by-step\nguide for you to keep in mind before taking the plunge. While you may already\nbe aware of these measures that help, it always helps to reiterate these\nthroughout the organization \u2013 especially to the team of L&D; managers who\nwould be taking the decision on selecting a learning management system or the\nupgrades that needs to happen on the one that already exists.\n\n![Choosing the Right LMS](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n## **Know Your Needs**\n\nBefore you start even window-shopping for an LMS solution, ask yourself:\n\n  1. Who is your target learner audience?\n  2. What are the learning objectives?\n  3. What are the skill-sets that need to be in focus and why?\n  4. What is your end goal (it is not limited to just improving performance)?\n  5. Would the training be imparted individually or simultaneously for the whole team?\n  6. How flexible do the learning modules and the deployment models need to be?\n\n  \nOnce you have the answer to the questions above, you are ready to embark on\nthe journey of finding a new LMS or an upgrade for the existing one. Learning\nobjectives and course logistics are always easier to ascertain before you\nstart weighing options.\n\n## **Know Your Best-Fit**\n\nTo understand what would work best for you, the next stage involves delving\ndeep into technical considerations and limitations. It is not simply about\nputting best practices to use, but rather to acknowledge the need for a best-\nfit learning strategy.\n\n**Dennis Budinich, Chief Culture Officer & SVP, Investors Bank, **shares that\n**\u201c** One of the biggest elements in identifying the right eLearning solution\nis to take the time to understand how people learn. By catering your approach\nto how an employee learns, employees are more likely to adopt these practices\ninto their daily lives. Adoption of these practices leads to behavioral\nchanges. This is something that is often missed by training and development\nleaders.\u201d\n\nHe adds \u201c **By focusing on the fundamental principles that support and enable\npeople to learn, adapt and practice, companies can set themselves up for\neLearning success for their employees.** \u201d\n\nOnce companies learn what principles work best for their employees, they know\nexactly what to look for in an eLearning solution. Focus on how and if the\nsolution moves the needle as opposed to price points, ease of use, etc.\nEmployers should be more interested in how people learn as opposed to how to\ntrain them with adoption and finding the right fit being the primary goal.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is Human Resource Development (HRD)? Definition,\nFunctions, and Best Practices for Training\nProgram](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-\nhuman-resource-development/)**\n\n## **Know Your Feature Priorities**\n\nWith technology getting upgraded every day, the LMS market is evolving as well\nas are the features that these solutions provide. But what are the features\nthat would work best for your organization? What are your \u201cfeature comforts\u201d?\nThis is where you need to have a must-have, good-to-have and great-to-have\nclassification for your desired features.\n\n**Hawley suggests that for an organization to upgrade to AI-enabled L &D; with\nease, \u201c**Personalized content/recommendations are a critical element of the\nmodern user experience for any application (think Netflix, Spotify, etc.). As\nthe corporate learning market evolves to focus more on the experience that\nmodern users expect, AI and machine learning become even more strategic for\nL&D; teams & leaders.\u201d She adds that **the need is to expand and leverage even\ndeeper people insights to create \u201cjust for me\u201d experiences, conversations and\nconnections that deliver \"one to one\" personal human interactions at a \"one to\nmany\" scale**. This is a key feature to keep in mind when shopping for new LMS\nsoftware. Your choice would also depend on discussion boards or forums,\ntest/assessment capabilities, enhanced security protocols, grading/scoring\nprocesses to track progress, data tracking, and automated user functions like\nnotifications.\n\n## **Know Your Growth Plans**\n\nWith choosing the right features and implementing a new Learning Management\nSystem, you need to know where you are headed as an organization. These are\nnot steps that you are taking just for today. For strategically sound\ndecisions, the scope of amplifying the learning and its application in\naddressing the future needs of the organization need to be kept in mind.\n\n**Skip Marshall, HCM Technology Executive at DXC Technology** lists the three\nmain challenges that organizations face today when it comes to upgrading their\nL&D; frameworks as follows:\n\n**Planning a strategy:** Organizations need to start with business objectives\nin mind.\n\n**Breaking down silos:** All business stakeholders must be vested and believe\nin the solution.\n\n**Undergoing change management:** Change is an inevitable part of business. It\nis important to view the speed of change as an opportunity to transition to\nmore user-friendly, flexible and inclusive learning systems. Obtain and\nachieve key business stakeholder support across business groups, to help drive\nthe solution.\n\nThese points are true especially when it comes to gauging how adaptive your\nchosen AI-enabled LMS will be in the future. Would it help you upgrade to the\nnext big thing after AI or be a deterrent to the next stages of evolution?\nFinding a solution that enhances fluidity while helping you make the most of\nimmediate technology is a wise move.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n## **Know by Experimentation**\n\n**Catie Bull, Senior Marketing Manager at Intrepid** speaks of a few questions\nthat organizations need to keep in mind when choosing the right eLearning\nsolution:\n\n  1. How easily does the technology help you reduce the time between designing and delivering training?\n  2. How much can you do directly on the platform (creation, review, etc.) versus having to keep relying on external old-school learning development processes, which cause delays?\n  3. Does this technology give you a way to help learners across multiple \u201cmoments of need\u201d or just one?\n  4. How much control does the technology give to the administrator/course creator vs. the learner themselves?\n  5. How easy is it to make changes in response to real-time feedback?\n  6. How much insight does the technology give you into learner behaviors so you can make changes based on usage and responses in real-time?\n  7. What is not just the company\u2019s level of technological expertise, but their level of expertise in learning experience design using technology?\n  8. Can they make you better learning designers through the use of their online platform?  \nA lot of these questions need to be answered in action and not in thought\nalone. That is where experimentation comes in. Yes, buying the right LMS is a\nbig investment and while you cannot buy one just to see how your organization\nreacts and adapts to it, you could do a trial run. Quite a few solution\nproviders do come with the option for a free trial.\n\n## **Through the Looking Glass: What does the future hold for AI in L &D;?**\n\nNext-generation learning tools include collaborative learning platforms, which\nare more business-centric and individual-driven. Learner Experience Platforms\n(LXP) focus closely on the quality of learner experience. Learning with next-\ngeneration tools moves from the one-to-many classroom-type model to include a\none-to-many along with a many-to-many social and collaborative interaction\nbetween learners, and moderators or subject matter experts as well. This\nstrengthens learning, heightens the sharing of insights, and surfaces tacit\ninstitutional knowledge that all can be shared and iterated upon.\n\nCatie says \u201c **By making the shift from learning to on-the-job application\nsimpler for the learner. Programs and tools which allow easy inclusion of\ncompany context\u2014the \u201cwhy\u201d behind all the \u201chow\u201d\u2014bridge the gap between\nknowledge and application back on the job**. They can also allow for\napplication on the job during the learning process, with assignments applying\nconcepts to real work products, with no gap.\u201d She adds that collaborative\nlearning programs spaced out over a period of time also allow for reflection.\nThis is critical to really absorbing and synthesizing new material.\n\n**Mike Begin, VP, Chief Technology Officer at Brainier Solutions** stresses on\nthe fact that \u201cEarly adoption of new technology usually comes with a high\nprice tag. In the case of AI, look for the features that are designed to\nimprove efficiency in L&D.; Features that provide your department the luxury\nto be more strategic than tactical in their duties.\u201d If you considered\nacquiring or licensing technology and relevant content that is aligned with\nyour organization\u2019s broader goals, the road ahead becomes simpler.\n\n**The convenience of predictive search and recommendation engines make\nsearching more efficient. Also, personalized dashboards offer real-time\nanalytics of trends in your learning group to help you stay informed.**\nUltimately, these tools can help to recruit new talent and take calculated\nrisks with more confidence. By viewing technology as an enabler, organizations\ncan benefit from innovation in the learning, development and training space,\nincluding advances in cloud computing, which has made it easier to manage\nchange with speed and dependability. At the heart of it all, remains the\nability and drive to adapt \u2013 to create a culture where employees are\ncomfortably aware of the fact that technology and skills will become redundant\neven faster in the future, and are uncomfortable enough to never become\ncomplacent \u2013 to keep learning, adapting and winning together.\n\n_How are you using AI to improve learning and development at work?

This\nincludes the following:\n\n**Recruiting** \\- A recruiting module helps hiring managers become aware of\nthe best candidates for each position and features easy solutions for job\npostings, submissions, skills testing, and the entire interview process.\n\n**Hiring** \\- An automated TMS system can assist with offer letters,\nbackground checks, e-signing of hiring documents and contracts, signing\nbonuses, relocation expenses, and more.\n\n**Onboarding** \\- The[ onboarding\nprocess](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-\nis-new-employee-onboarding/) can be automated to provide corporate training\nand presentations either electronically or in a physical office. This can be\ndone through a series of videos, a corporate intranet with special tools and\ninformation for new hires, a FAQs database, mentoring scheduling, and anything\nelse that can help a new employee hit the ground running.\n\n**Compensation and Performance Management** \\- The TMS system can be utilized\nto set employees\u2019 pay grades, hiring levels, annual review scheduling and\ntracking, career advancement, incentives, and provide management with a\n360-degree view of an employee\u2019s performance throughout their tenure with the\ncompany.\n\n**Continuing education and development** \\- Through online or in-person\nclasses, continuing education and corporate e-learning programs can make it\neasy for staff to enhance their skills and move up the corporate ladder. It\ncan also be an important asset when it comes to meeting governmental and legal\nrequirements for certifications in industries such as government, healthcare,\neducation, and more.\n\n**Learn more:[How to Make the Talent Development Evolution Work for Your\nOrganization](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/how-to-make-the-talent-development-evolution-work-for-your-\norganization/)**\n\n## **Why should business owners consider talent management software?**\n\nOne of the main purposes of an HR talent management software system is to\nautomate and streamline the entire hiring and nurturing process. It also\nprovides useful analytics and feedback to help management see which employees\nare excelling and which ones need more attention and development.\n\nTalent management technology can capture, store and analyze important data\nthroughout the entire lifecycle of an employee that can be utilized to improve\nbusiness processes as well as the work lives of a company\u2019s staff. This \u201cbig\ndata\u201d approach leads to better recruiting, more qualified candidates, a\nshorter and more efficient hiring process, and a decrease in employee\nturnover.\n\nAccording to [a recent report from Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/talent-\nmanagement-software/user-research), 73% of talent management software users\nstated that their system had a positive effect on the time they spend\nperforming HR administrative tasks. They also reported a reduction in the\namount of time spent recruiting, lower costs, and an increase in employee\nengagement and satisfaction.\n\n## **How to choose talent management software**\n\nShopping for a new talent management solution can be intimidating and\nconfusing. There are so many options available and so much to think about when\nimplementing new technology throughout your organization. People are reluctant\nto any type of change and having to learn a new system might not go over well\nwith all of your staff.\n\nHere are a few best practices that can help you choose the right TMS and get\nyour entire organization on board.\n\n### **1\\. Get input from your team and involve them in the final decision.**\n\n  \nIn order to ensure a solution is the right fit and feel for your organization,\nstart with getting feedback from your entire team. Your HR team should have a\nlot of input, considering the fact that they will be the ones using it the\nmost. But you should also discuss the decision with your entire management\nteam, since everyone will be involved in utilizing the system for performance\nreviews, feedback, mentoring, and more.\n\n### **2\\. Think about the level of integration and specialization you need.**\n\n  \nDo you have specific or legacy programs that would need to be customized and\nintegrated with a new system, or could you just simply make the switch over to\nan out-of-the-box solution? Are you in an industry that has to meet specific\nregulations that will require special programming or a certain type of\nsoftware? Keep in mind that you might not be able to find everything you\u2019re\nlooking for in one solution. You may need to consider a customized software\nprogram built specifically for your organization and your requirements.\n\n### **3\\. Decide if you need an on-premise, cloud-based, or hybrid solution.**\n\n  \nIf you have several locations, you\u2019ll probably want to go with a cloud-based\nTMS option. However, if you work with highly classified or privileged\ninformation, a more secure on-premise application would be the best choice.\nPerhaps you need a hybrid combination of both. Knowing exactly what type works\nbest for your organization before you start shopping for a solution will save\nyou a lot of time.\n\n### **4\\. Look for a solution with a detailed analytics module.**\n\n  \nYou want your TMS software to be able to gather valuable information, analyze\nthat data, and provide you with actionable insights that can help improve\nevery aspect of your business. A lot of solutions come with standard analytics\nas part of the package and some have an upgraded option. Spending a little\nextra on software that has a built-in [big data\nsolution](https://www.itechart.com/solutions/big-data-bi/) will be well worth\nthe additional costs.\n\n### **5\\. Choose your vendor wisely.**\n\n  \nYou are making a large investment in your TMS solution, so you need to know\nthat the vendor you choose will be there for you over the long haul. What type\nof support do they offer? Is it 24/7? Do you have a trial period where you can\ntest the product before signing a long contract? What happens if your vendor\ngets bought out by a larger company? It\u2019s always a good idea to check vendor\nreferences and read online reviews of other companies who have used or are\ncurrently using the product.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nTalent management systems are not just for large enterprise businesses.\nStartups and small to medium size companies can also benefit from the\nautomation, increased efficiencies, and analytical data provided by these\ntypes of software solutions.\n\nWhatever you\u2019re looking for, rest assured that there is a TMS solution for\nyou. You may need a bit of customization or training, but the upfront costs\nand time spent learning a new system will be well worth the investment when\nyou\u2019re hiring and retaining the highest quality employees. It\u2019s a win for\neverybody.\n\n**Learn more:**[How to Leverage AI for Talent Management\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/how-to-leverage-ai-for-\ntalent-management/)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhy-you-need-a-talent-management-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Why+You+Need+a+Talent+Management+System\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Why+You+Need+a+Talent+Management+System&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhy-you-need-a-talent-management-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhy-you-need-a-talent-management-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhy-you-need-a-talent-management-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Why You Need a Talent Management\nSystem&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhy-you-need-a-talent-management-\nsystem%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

Considering the [increasing use of\nAI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2018/12/19/how-fast-is-\nartificial-intelligence-growing-look-at-the-key-bellwethers/#532f0e17474a),\none of the greatest opportunities for AI to be realized is in [learning\nmanagement systems](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/what-is-a-learning-management-system-lms/).\n\n## What Is Artificial Intelligence?\n\nBefore we jump into the use of artificial intelligence in learning and\ndevelopment, it\u2019s important to understand what AI is. AI or artificial\nintelligence simply refers to the capability machines have to learn and\nprocess data on their own using data sets.\n\nOnce a machine learns from the data they collect, they can make \u201cdecisions\u201d on\ntheir own, based on the data they\u2019ve collected.\n\nMachine learning is simply an extension of AI and refers to machines that are\ntrained to analyze data and trends. These machines build their own algorithms\nfrom the data they collect and use it to make \u201cdecisions\u201d without human\nintervention.\n\n## Learning Management Systems\n\nCurrently, AI plays a small role in learning and development systems through\nE-learning and learning management systems.\n\nThese systems are some of the best ways to help students learn because they\n[increase retention up to\n60%](https://www.shiftelearning.com/blog/bid/301248/15-facts-and-stats-that-\nreveal-the-power-of-elearning), allow multiple students to receive instruction\nat the same time, and offer opportunities for improvements and customized\neducation in the future.\n\nData gathered by your LMS through surveys, ratings, comments, and course\nmetrics needs to be updated by human hands. And even the best artificial\nintelligence can\u2019t make up for poorly created content.\n\nKeeping learning and development up-to-date through LMS AI resources takes,\ntime and even AI needs a little human help to enhance learning and\ndevelopment.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n## The Future of Learning Management\n\nToday\u2019s intelligent learning management systems help pinpoint where students\nneed additional education and training as well as where you can optimize your\ncourse content in a faster and more accurate way than you can without the\nassistance of artificial intelligence.\n\nBut AI\u2019s role is constantly expanding across every industry.\n\nPerhaps the greatest realization for AI in the future of learning and\ndevelopment is that it will help anticipate the user\u2019s learning path and\nbehaviors, predict their learning needs and provide content based on how users\nlearn best and increase the effectiveness of e-learning and LMS courses.\n\n## Anticipated Learning Path\n\nAs AI continues to improve in the future, it will become easier for systems to\ncreate customized learning paths for individual users.\n\nTransforming learning and development through an anticipated learning path\nmeans that artificial intelligence will assess user performance and determine\nwhich information path is best for the user.\n\nAI with these capabilities will provide recommendations on what kinds of\ninformation a user\u2019s needs, much like Netflix or Amazon provides\nrecommendations on what shows you should watch based on your viewing behavior.\n\nAside from helping users find better learning paths, artificial intelligence\ncan also assist in learning and development by helping teaching professionals\nunderstand what their employees need to learn.\n\n## Opportunity Highlight\n\nThrough data pattern identification, learning management systems collect data\nand statistics on students to find learning gaps and opportunities that\nteachers may not have noticed or realized.\n\nUsing pattern identification, and data, artificial intelligence can help\nidentify opportunities to merge new ideas with previous topics to create a\nwell-rounded learning experience for the user. This allows administrators and\nteachers to cover learning gaps they may not even realize exist.\n\n## Course Effectiveness\n\nArtificial intelligence can also assist learning and development efforts by\nhelping teachers find ways to make courses more effective. One of these ways\nis through gamification. If done properly, gamification can make learning\nmore[ engaging](https://www.bunchball.com/blog/post/1919/how-gamification-\nlearning-improves-knowledge-retention) and increase information retention.\n\nIncreasing course effectiveness can also assist teachers directly by making it\neasier to find opportunities to make the course more effective, fill\ninformational gaps, automatically grade students, help with onboarding, and\nget the instruction process moving.\n\n## Artificial Intelligence in the Future of Learning and Development\n\nAlthough there are many unknowns in the future of AI, applying the tools we\nhave to improve the future of learning and development will help us create a\nmore personalized approach to our e-learning and learning management systems.\n\nArtificial intelligence shouldn\u2019t be looked at as a replacement of humans in\nthe educational process, but as a support system that allows us to take\nindividualized learning to the next level.  \n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhow-artificial-intelligence-in-learning-management-systems-will-\nstreamline-employee-\nlearning%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=How+Artificial+Intelligence+%28AI%29+in+Learning+Management+Systems+%28LMS%29+will+Streamline+Employee+Learning\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+Artificial+Intelligence+%28AI%29+in+Learning+Management+Systems+%28LMS%29+will+Streamline+Employee+Learning&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhow-artificial-intelligence-in-learning-management-systems-will-\nstreamline-employee-\nlearning%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhow-artificial-intelligence-in-learning-management-systems-will-\nstreamline-employee-\nlearning%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhow-artificial-intelligence-in-learning-management-systems-will-\nstreamline-employee-\nlearning%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=How Artificial Intelligence \\(AI\\) in\nLearning Management Systems \\(LMS\\) will Streamline Employee\nLearning&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Flearning-\ndevelopment%2Fhow-artificial-intelligence-in-learning-management-systems-will-\nstreamline-employee-\nlearning%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Learning & Development ](/category/learning-development/\n\"Learning & Development\")\n\n  * [ ![How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the Future](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/all_about_pwcs_digital_upskilling_program_and_how_you_can_take_inspiration_from_it_5e5fb8b6e3968.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-pwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-future-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ How PwC's Digital Upskilling Program Is Preparing Its Workers for the\nFuture ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\npwcs-digital-upskilling-program-is-preparing-its-workers-for-the-\nfuture-8/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nPwC has made digital upskilling a top priority to prepare for the future of\nwork.

That is, if you choose the right one.\n\nWith hundreds of LMS providers out there, it can be daunting to pick the right\none for your company. With so many different factors at play, it\u2019s important\nto understand your company\u2019s needs before jumping into the process.\n\n# How to choose an LMS\n\nChoosing an [LMS](https://www.goskills.com/Blog/What-is-an-LMS) isn\u2019t as easy\nas picking the most feature rich solution out there. In fact, doing just that\ncan backfire on you. A system that\u2019s too complex can alienate admins and\nlearners that aren\u2019t digital natives. Conversely, a system that\u2019s too\nsimplified will hinder course creators and learning admins from living up to\ntheir full potential.\n\nAside from the features, there are a number of other factors you will need to\nconsider when making your decision. In this article, we will go through the\nsteps you can take to make an informed decision.\n\n## Spell out your training needs\n\nSelecting a system is akin to Goldilocks\u2019 dilemma. There isn\u2019t a one size fits\nall solution and in order to find the perfect fit you will first need to\nfigure out what \u201cperfect\u201d means in relation to your company. Mapping out your\ncompany\u2019s training needs is a process done best with collaboration. If you\nhave an existing training solution, speak to admins and a small group of\nlearners to find out what\u2019s lacking.\n\n### Who are you training?\n\nThis might be apparent to you already, but knowing who you\u2019re training is\nessential to determining how you will train and what solution you should use.\n\n#### Age\n\nMeeting people at their digital literacy level is key to improving engagement\nrates. If your company skews older, it would be wise to opt for an LMS with\nlimited features and a friendly UX. A LMS that\u2019s difficult to use can alienate\nlearners who have only recently become digitally literate.\n\nIf there is a millennial majority, you may want to consider a system with\ngamification and social learning elements. An LMS that mimics digital\ninteractions millennials have outside of work makes learning an engaging\nexperience.\n\n#### Size\n\nHow many people do you plan on training? A team, or the entire company? If you\nplan on training a smaller group of people, you might be limited by the\nsolutions you can opt for. A number of learning management systems have\nminimum learner requirements.\n\nIf your company is growing or has a significant turnover rate, you will have\nto consider the different pricing plans as well as the mass user registration\nfeatures.\n\n**Here are some of the pricing plans you will encounter:  **\n\n  * **Pay-per-learner:** ideal if you have a stable number of learners and if training is mandatory\n  * **Pay-per-active-user:** ideal if you have one-time training (e.g. onboarding) or if you\u2019d like to train batches of learners over the year.\n  * **Pay-as-you-go:** ideal if you\u2019re unsure if there will be a stable demand for learning\n  * **License fee:** ideal for large enterprises\n\n#### Skills\n\nIs everyone starting at level one, or are some learners more advanced? If\nyou\u2019re training people with different skill sets, you should look into a\nsystem that lets you segment your audience, create learning paths, or use\nplacement tests.\n\nIf a learner is forced to complete lessons they have already mastered, they\nmay not be as inclined to continue learning, However, this won\u2019t matter if\nyour learners are starting from the same place. So if your objective is\ncompliance training, you won\u2019t have to worry about placement functionality.\nHowever, you will need a solution with a robust tracking system.\n\n### What are your goals?\n\nWhat do you hope to achieve through your learning and development initiatives?\nWhen setting your goals, use the [SMART goals](/smart-goals) format to ensure\nyou\u2019re being specific.\n\nTo refresh your memory, SMART stands for specific, measurable, achievable,\nrealistic, and time limited. So instead of \u201cincrease compliance rate\u201d, your\ngoal could be \u201creduce time for certification from three months to two weeks.\u201d\nBreaking down your goals into smaller chunks betters your chance of achieving\nthem.\n\nHelp yourself with a free template to get your SMART goals in check!\n\n[![Ready to set some SMART goals? Download FREE worksheet](https://no-\ncache.hubspot.com/cta/default/4099946/2ab72641-b175-4378-973b-6036c07b29fe.png)](https://cta-\nredirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/4099946/2ab72641-b175-4378-973b-6036c07b29fe)\n\nAs well as setting goals for the immediate future, take into consideration\nyour company\u2019s goals for the next five years. Selecting an LMS that can fulfil\nthe training needs of today and tomorrow will save you time and money in the\nlong run.\n\n### What are your technical requirements?\n\nThe key technical requirements you should be concerned with are content\n(various types), support, user management, learning models, reporting,\nsecurity, and integrations.\n\n#### Content\n\nWhat type of content do you already have? What type of content do you plan on\ncreating in the next few years? Make a list of the file types you need\nsupported (e.g. [SCORM](https://www.goskills.com/Blog/What-is-scorm), PDFs,\nexternal links, audio, video) and another list of nice-to-have supported file\ntypes for the future.\n\nAnother technical content requirement to consider is where the content is\ncoming from. Some LMS have inbuilt content editors that enable admins to\ncreate learning materials from within the platform, or a team that can help\nyou create custom courses from your existing materials.\n\n#### Support\n\nAnother green flag is a robust support service. While you want your solution\nto be intuitive and easy-to-use, you do want to be able to get help when you\nneed it. Once you have shortlisted a few providers, try contacting their\nsupport to ensure their responses meet your standards.\n\n#### User management\n\nAgain, depending on how many people you plan on training, registration will be\na factor you will need to consider. Will learners register themselves or will\nan admin do this?\n\nIf you\u2019re training a large group, look into systems that offer mass\nregistration features such as a CSV upload. If you have high turnover, an\nautomated data feed will cut down on admin workload. Do you have multiple\nadmins working on the LMS? Ensure that the system you pick allows for joint\ncontrol over the system.\n\n#### Learning models\n\nAnother way to narrow down the search is by defining whether your training\nwill be exclusively online, exclusive online, or blended. If your L&D\ninitiatives involve instructor-led training, you will need a platform that\nlets you manage schedules and locations, as well as monitor attendances.\n\n#### Reporting\n\nLearning and development initiatives are all about the results. How do you\nplan on measuring them? Look back to the goals you created in the previous\nstep and note down the metrics you need to collect in order to track their\nprogress.\n\nDo you need the data to be exportable? Are you more interested in group\nmetrics or individual reporting? Do you need the ability to customize reports?\n\n#### Security\n\nSecurity is an important part of eLearning, especially when compliance comes\ninto play. Learners shouldn\u2019t be able to log into each others accounts and\ntheir data should be kept safe.\n\n**Some factors to think about are:**\n\n  * Location of data storage\n  * User authentication\n  * Who can have access to what data\n\nIntegrations\n\nDoes your company use existing Business Intelligence or HR software? If so, is\nit essential that the LMS connects to it? Answering these questions thoroughly\nwill give you clarity when evaluating the different solutions out there. Once\nyou have a definitive list of your requirements, you can start thinking about\nthe extra features you\u2019d like to have.\n\n### What are your nice-to-haves?\n\nAt this point in the LMS search, you can also ask your mini focus group\ncomprised of learners and admins to dream up nice-to-have features. Learning\ntechnology is constantly evolving. Here are just a handful of extra features\nyou may encounter on your search for an LMS:\n\n  * **Social learning:** this can present in a number of forms, but they all involve some social aspect. (e.g. knowledge sharing, competition)\n  * **Talent management:** creation of learning paths to close skill gaps\n  * **Mobile learning:** training is accessible through an app or through an adaptive platform.\n  * **E-commerce:** the ability to sell the courses you create\n  * **White labelling:** makes training feel like a seamless part of the learning experience. Most LMS have basic white labelling features (e.g. logo or theme colours). If you want training to feel even more seamless, you can look into adding the platform to your domain.\n  * **Gamification:** like social learning, this can also take on many forms (e.g. points, rewards, leaderboards) and have a motivating effect on learners\n  * **Certificates:** the ability to upload or create certificates through the platform\n\n## Explore your options\n\nOnce you have a robust idea of your requirements, it\u2019s time to look at your\noptions. You can use sites like G2 to filter by feature in order to come up\nwith a shortlist of LMS to pick from. With so many learning management systems\non the market, this list might be quite long.\n\nOne way to narrow the list down is by asking your peers about their\nexperiences with learning management systems or reading online reviews.\nRemember to take notes while you\u2019re doing this. Evaluating different solutions\nis a long process and the different SaaS may start blending into one. Using an\nExcel sheet to evaluate the different options and keep track of the notes\nmight be tedious, but will help you out down the line.\n\n## Narrow down the list\n\nAfter you\u2019ve come up with a list of options, it\u2019s time to narrow the list down\neven further. You can do this by investigating a vendor\u2019s track record. Have\nthey won awards? How many years have they been in business? Do they have a\nhistory of iterating and advancing their product? How many businesses have\nthey worked with?\n\nAwards, years in business, innovation, and experience are all green flags to\nlook out for. Another thing to look out for is a strong knowledge base \u2013 are\nthere how to articles and video tutorials available?\n\nHow does this vendor handle updates? Will you be informed well in advance?\nWill you need to pay extra to be upgraded? Once you have further downsized\nyour list to 3-5 vendors, it\u2019s time to take the next step.\n\n### Request a demo\n\nBefore you request a demo, refer back to your needs training goals and come up\nwith a list of use cases for the LMS. Additionally, prepare a list of\nquestions to ask the vendor\u2019s representative. Use this time to find out about\nhidden costs, user data protection, customization, or any information you\ncouldn\u2019t find in the research process. Finally, gather the relevant internal\nstakeholders and let the demos commence.\n\n### Try it yourself\n\nThe demos will have given you more clarity when choosing a platform. However,\nthe real test is using the software yourself. Most learning management systems\noffer free trials for a week or a month. Take advantage of this by signing\nyourself up for the shortlisted platforms.\n\nList out possible scenarios and use cases and work your way through the\nplatforms. What does it look like for a learner trying to take a course? What\nhappens when you delete users? How easy is it to download reports? If things\naren\u2019t as easy to use, take this opportunity to contact their support. Is help\navailable right away or do you have to wait?\n\nIf you\u2019re having difficulty using the platform, this is not a good sign as it\nwill likely take your colleagues more time to master using the system. After\nall this research, you\u2019re probably an LMS whiz!\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThere is no one size fits all solution. If there was, there wouldn\u2019t be so\nmany learning management systems out there.\n\nWhen choosing an LMS, your objectives need to be clear.

It\u2019s a shocking\nstatistic in this day and age. By looking across the market though there are\nlessons to be learnt from big companies and education that could benefit you\nif you\u2019re looking to [develop a plan for your business or\ndepartment.](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/roi-learning-development)\n\n## Companies embracing new approaches to learning\n\nThe last few years have seen an explosion in new approaches to workplace\nlearning, especially at an enterprise level. Gone are the dry days of [dull\ntraining sessions with little to no meaning for most\nworkers](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/learner-centred-approach). Functional\ntraining designed for many aspects of health and safety has moved to digital\nsystems, reducing employee time away from being productive and providing\ncompanies with the ability to track full take-up and delegate understanding of\nthe subject.\n\nMore importantly, companies have started to adopt a programme-focused learning\nmanagement system (LMS) utilised by large education establishments. They are\ncombining them with agile, high-quality training and development to deliver\nbest-in-class experiences that are enriching the lives of the employee. They\noften far exceed the quality and range of learning that a university or\ncollege can offer. These courses and learning programmes are based on real-\nlife needs and strategic objectives of businesses.\n\nSky is one such employer that has rolled out this new L&D approach. The media\ncompany has overhauled its training programme over the last 18 months,\nbecoming more agile and tapping into the current trend for user-centric\nlearning blended with marketing techniques to ensure employee adoption stays\nhigh.\n\nIn terms of LMS, increasingly this is being extended from education to\nemployment, offering a school-to-working-life experience. Having employees\njoining a company that understands a platform on which they can develop their\nskills and record achievements can be compelling.\n\n## Using AI and data to train employees\n\nOf course, the big rush at the moment is to explore artificial intelligence\n(AI) in the context of L&D platforms. It\u2019s enabling more and more companies to\nuse the analytics and insight generated by the user to deliver personalised\nlearning experiences. These can help to progress them with minimal assistance\nand at a scale hitherto unknown. However, the current [application of true AI\nin human resources (HR)](https://www.raconteur.net/digital-transformation/ai-\nhr-pros-cons) is still quite small and we\u2019re at the very earliest stages of\nthe transformation.\n\nKatarina Berg, the chief HR officer of Spotify, who spoke to us as part of\nUNLEASH World in Paris this October, evidences this. Her role is unique in\nbeing someone having access to Spotify\u2019s internal systems for audience\nanalytics and comparing these to those on offer for HR. She has shared with\nUNLEASH how many embryonic systems there actually are within HR.\n\nThe critical aspect of designing an L&D programme is that it should deliver\nvalue for both the employee and the employer. Learning is best taken on board\nwhen it can be put into practice straight away. So within an organisation,\nwhen developing plans, you should be taking stock of what aspects you\u2019ll\nexpect to see the employee picking up, or improving in, straight away. L&D\nprogrammes should be in alignment with the employee\u2019s long-term personal\ngoals.\n\nWell-structured L&D programmes have consistently shown they can drive up\nretention, ratings, revenues and return on investment. If you\u2019re one of the 99\nper cent of small business in the UK, there\u2019s a wealth of organisations that\ncan support you with free L&D for you and your teams. Many councils support\nlocal enterprise with free resources and the Duke of York\u2019s iDEA programme is\none example of an excellent tool for self-initiated learning.\n\nAlso found in

This function has been reinvented\nmultiple times over the last 30\u201340 years, primarily in tandem with advances in\ntechnology. Today, the function is being reimagined, thanks once again to\ntechnological advances and the changes in socio-cultural norms such advances\nhave brought about.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83497b97cac.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nThe rise of millennials and Gen Z in the workforce means that for the first\ntime we will have a digital native workforce. Well educated and tech-savvy,\nthis workforce demands a whole new experience from their workplace. Digital\nnatives who grew up with Facebook, YouTube, and the iPhone expect their\nworkplace experience to mirror their consumer experiences. This has an impact\non learning methodologies and technologies used in an organizational context.\n\nThe other micro trend that impacts learning functions is the rise of\nautomation in workplaces. Automation, artificial intelligence, and machine\nlearning are transforming job roles and skills faster than ever. According to\na [Brookings Institution study](https://www.brookings.edu/research/automation-\nand-artificial-intelligence-how-machines-affect-people-and-places/), nearly 25\npercent of jobs in the U.S. may be automated in the near future. Organizations\nnow are looking at ways to help train and re-train their staff for just such a\ndigital future of work.\n\nThese two external forces are acting alongside an internal force within\nlearning and development functions. Traditionally, these functions operated as\ncommand and control centers, deciding on what employees would learn, as well\nas how and when. Today the department is being asked to get out of the way of\nlearning and development and make the process more inclusive and democratic.\nWith the advent of technology, employees can find what they want and can\nchoose to learn how and when they learn.\n\nThe learning solutions marketplace has started to react to these realities and\nhence what we see today is a cacophony of solutions addressing multiple needs.\nThe learning technology buyer is bombarded with multiple solutions and\napproaches. What you may have to do is actually simple. If you are clear about\nyour organizational needs and aspirations and align them with your cultural\nand demographic realities, you may start to find the answers.\n\nIn this crowded marketplace, you may not find the one solution that solves all\nyour needs, but you can build a bouquet of solutions customized to your needs\nsourced from the market. Integrations and interactions between these multiple\nlearning systems to create a seamless user experience is thus your key\nchallenge. The cost of doing this is, of course, a primary focus and sometimes\na constraint in designing what you desire.\n\nIn the midst of this disruption, we must not forget that there are five\nlearning styles that have been identified in this guide. And we still need to\nensure that our approaches meet the diverse needs of a multi-generational\nworkforce that is trying to adapt to the ever-evolving world of technology and\nwork. Therefore, the learning technologies you choose must strike a fine\nbalance between catering to your current needs and your future needs. Like\nmost other technological decisions, this is not a destination but a journey.\nWe hope this attempt at providing some direction to these efforts helps in\nyour journey.\n\n## **Why You Need an eLearning Solution**\n\nIn today\u2019s hyper-competitive economic environment, every business function is\nunder scrutiny for the value it adds to the bottom line. And corporate\nlearning is no exception. However, the challenge with traditional learning and\ndevelopment (L&D;) initiatives has been measuring their ROI in hard dollar\nterms, especially in ways that make sense to the C-suite.\n\nBut eLearning is changing that. Thanks to the rapid pace of digital\ntransformation, a widening skills gap, and the need for businesses to\nconstantly innovate, the L&D; industry in 2019 is at a [tipping\npoint.](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/why-2019-is-the-year-of-learning-and-development-insights-from-\nlinkedins-2019-workplace-learning-report/) The ubiquity of digital learning\nsolutions means that L&D; leaders can now track the efficacy of their learning\nprograms and measure their business impact.\n\nThe evolution of eLearning from [learning management systems\n(LMS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-a-\nlearning-management-system-lms/), which are essentially vast repositories of\nlearning content hosted on-premises or on the cloud, to the more advanced\nlearning experience platforms (LXP) that focus on enhancing the learning\nexperience and the content within it, points to the changing needs of learners\nand organizations alike.\n\nBuilding on the foundations of the traditional LMS, LXPs curate learning\ncontent, develop learning/career pathways and provide learners with\npersonalized learning recommendations. Industry analyst, Josh Bersin,\ndescribes LXPs as \u201cNetflix -like\u201d platforms with multi-device content delivery\ncapabilities, AI-driven recommendations, social profiles, and an intuitive\ninterface that mirror popular video streaming apps.\n\nAs organizations embrace the promise of data-driven decision making and\ntechnologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and Internet\nof things (IoT), preparing employees for the future of work has become a top\npriority. Business leaders have responded by [increasing L&D;\nbudgets](https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report) to\nup- and re-skill the workforce at scale.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n**So, what does this mean for you as an L &D; professional? **\n\nBigger budgets and executive buy-in means L&D; professionals will play a far\nmore strategic role in the business. As the C-suite looks to L&D;\nprofessionals to help close the skills gap and improve learning outcomes, how\ndo you build the business and investment cases to show leadership a clear path\ntowards the changes that need to occur?\n\n## **The Business Case for Corporate eLearning**\n\nIf you\u2019ve determined that your organization needs a new eLearning solution or\ntechnology, here are three ways to show the C-suite that an investment in\neLearning will yield real benefits now and in the future.\n\n  1. **Closing Your Own Skills Gap to Thrive in the Future of Work**  \nWith low unemployment levels and large-scale digital disruption, employers are\nhaving a hard time finding candidates with the skills they require, even for\nentry-level jobs. \u201cThe current climate for hiring experienced candidates is\ntough, especially as we approach a more \u2018fluid\u2019 workforce. With a low\nunemployment rate, fewer people are seeking jobs because they actually need\nthem than at any time I can remember,\u201d says Jerry Cox, CEO at\n[Brainer](https://www.brainier.com/). \u201cOne study we read recently says that\nnearly 65 percent of children entering primary school today will ultimately\nend up in a job type that doesn\u2019t exist yet. I\u2019m actually surprised it\u2019s not\nhigher than that. For example, consider the fact that the learning tools we\ncurrently use online did not exist when we were starting in school. They\nweren\u2019t even thought of.\u201d According to the Harvard Business Review, only [15\npercent](https://hbr.org/2017/11/managers-arent-doing-enough-to-train-\nemployees-for-the-future) of employees report that their employers offer them\nopportunities to develop the technical skills they will need in the future.\nAnd just 8 percent say they are given the chance to expand their management\nand leadership skills.  \n  \nWith technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep\nlearning becoming essential to conducting business, regardless of the\nindustry, employers need to prepare their workforce for the future of work.\nAnd eLearning solutions help HR and L&D; professionals achieve upskilling and\nreskilling at scale.  \n  \n\u201cIt\u2019s all about scalability,\u201d says Piers Lea, Chief Strategy Officer at\nlearning technology solutions major, [LTG](https://www.ltgplc.com/). \u201cTo quote\nJohn Hagel, founder of the Deloitte Centre for the Edge, \u2018Scalable learning is\nthe new reason for large organizations to exist.\u2019 The old concept of the\ntraining course must be replaced by channel thinking. Organizations must\nestablish channels to reach people with necessary learning right in the flow\nof work. And not just one channel, but many. Smart learning solutions are\nmultichannel, multimodal learning solutions.  \n  \nSo, for example, in addition to one-way eLearning courses, solutions must\noffer tools for collaboration and for employees to exchange knowledge and\nexperience through rich media like video.\u201d  \n  \nJerry Cox believes that the hallmark for successful organizations is\ncontinuous learning and skill development. He says, \u201cWhile a formal education\nis a good foundation, we must be prepared to teach high quality, high aptitude\nnew hires new skills and provide the knowledge they currently don\u2019t have.\nContinual skill development and refinement has been a hallmark for many\nsuccessful organizations to create a competitive edge.  \n  \n\u201cTo take it a step further, successful organizations will look to include on-\ngoing learning as an actual benefit. While it has historically been difficult\nto show straight-line ROI results from investing in L&D;, the residual effect\nof this investment is often an increased sense of loyalty to the organization.\nEmployees feel valued when their employer shows them that they have a future\nwithin the organization and are going to give them the tools they need to be\nsuccessful in the long term.\u201d\n\n  2. **Deliver a Differentiated Employee Experience to Increase Retention**  \nEmployees want to work for organizations that offer new opportunities to learn\nand grow. In fact, one of the top reasons people change jobs today is for\n\u2018career growth opportunities.\u2019 As employees perceive workplace experience\nthrough the lens of culture, L&D; opportunities, and effective leadership \u2013\nproviding them with a flexible, mobile, learning platform is not just an\neffective attraction and retention tactic, but also a forward-looking business\nstrategy.  \n  \nWith the increasing application of AI and ML across eLearning solutions,\nemployers can personalize learning content delivery to improve engagement and\nexperience. Here are five applications of eLearning technologies that can help\nyou improve the employee experience:\n\n    * **Mobile-learning:** Mobile-learning, also known as mlearning, is an L&D; concept that makes learning accessible across portable devices like smartphones and tablets. While mobile delivery is at the heart of effective mlearning, it is not solely the delivery model that makes it different from traditional learning approaches. The learning content also varies significantly for mlearning courses. The idea is to meet learners where they are and deliver an engaging learning experience to improve learning outcomes. Jodi Younes, L&D; Director at [Goodway Group](http://goodwaygroup.com/), says, \u201cMeet your learners where they are. Learners are already connected through mobile phones, tablets, and computers.   \n  \nOrganizations must create easy to consume, impactful, engaging opportunities\nthat make learning fun. As we move towards a gig-economy, this will be a\ncritical element to L&D; strategy.\u201d  \n\n    * **On-demand learning:** At a time in which we\u2019ve become so accustomed to having information at our fingertips, employee expectations from workplace learning also flows along similar lines. They want to be in control of their own learning, challenging the traditional approach to L&D; that was slow to respond to learner needs. \u201cCreate on-demand learning opportunities that are short, high quality and high impact, as well as tailored to the needs and gaps of the learner. Ditch the old ways of dictating when learners can attend a training session and give them the flexibility to access learning when, where and how they want it! It is also important to remember to offer a variety of learning formats. Some learners prefer shorter, virtual training opportunities, whereas others prefer live, face to face sessions and others may even prefer to learn from coaching, mentoring and on the job opportunities. Provide flexibility so learners can have access to tailored learning that fits their wants and needs,\u201d advises Jodi.  \n\n    * **Microlearning:** Microlearning is a way of delivering learning content to learners in small, bite-sized bursts to improve retention. Like on-demand learning, microlearning is also largely a self-directed learning experience. Jodi recommends that L&D; teams add interactive features like gamification, chat, and videos to boost engagement with microlearning. She says, \u201cLearning leaders need to continue to focus on bite-size, short training, especially taking into account the fact that so much learning can happen on a mobile device. App-based learning, quick videos, and chat features are all ways to integrate microlearning experiences.\u201d  \n\n    * **Digital Knowledge Sharing:** \u201cSocial learning is key!\u201d says Jodi. \u201cFinding ways to integrate social learning helps reinforce learning and best practices. Again, considering the gig-economy and virtual workforce, digital knowledge sharing, and social networks help employees share information, stay connected and cross-learn. When considering Millennials and Gen Z workers, they use text messaging and social networks to communicate, even more so than email or phone. Finding learners where they already spend their time is key.\u201d  \n\n    * **Curated content via a content management system:** Information overload is one of the most common problems we face as customers today. Thanks to smart digital technologies, we just have TOO many options for everything from movies on Netflix, to shoes on Amazon. Your employees face similar challenges when deciding on a learning program. There\u2019s too much learning content available and it becomes challenging to find what is of value. Content curation as an L&D; strategy can help employees navigate the sea of learning content to find exactly what they\u2019re looking for and become motivated learners.  \n  \n\u201cProvide a space for learners to easily access and find a vast amount of\ncontent. With continued reliance on the cloud, the possibilities are endless!\nThe key to having an effective content management system is structure. L&D;,\nHR, and leadership all need to have an understanding of the skills learners\nneed to grow and help them identify opportunities to develop their\ncapabilities. Employees should own their individual development and providing\nthem a space with adequate training and resources, plus leadership and\norganization support helps to increase engagement and results,\u201d says Jodi.  \n\n  3. **Contain Costs**  \nWhile both points above are equally important to the C-suite, cost containment\nmay be the star of your eLearning business case. Traditional learning and\ndevelopment programs have been resource and cost-intensive (think seminars and\ninstructor-led programs). With eLearning, you can easily save on travel\nexpenses, accommodation, and the trainer\u2019s fee. eLearning offers a flexible\napproach to employees to work towards their self-development at their\nconvenience. Also, eLearning is typically quicker and more effective than\nclassroom training. Which means quicker inductions, lower downtimes, and\nsignificant cost savings.  \n\n## **Vendor Mapping:**\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the popular eLearning platforms and their features**:\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader.png)**_Figure 1_**\n\n## **Implementation Plan**\n\nAssuming your business case for an eLearning platform has been approved, it\nwould be helpful at this point to formulate a basic implementation plan. An\nideal implementation plan should include the change management strategy,\ntimelines, and other key elements of the initiative as listed in our\nimplementation guide (figure 2).

Consumers have much higher expectations when it comes to\nspeed, convenience, and personalization, which has caused retailers to rethink\ntheir business models. And through this transformation, retailers are\nempowering their employees to learn new skills and hiring talent for positions\nthat didn\u2019t exist before, all with the goal of delivering a better customer\nexperience. This ability to redefine and upskill the retail workforce is what\nseparates retailers who will succeed from the ones who will eventually become\na distant memory.\n\nWe recently chatted with Polly Foote, head of HR operational excellence at\nFerguson Enterprises, the largest plumbing distributor in the United States.\nIn addition to plumbing parts and supplies, Ferguson also sells faucets,\nsinks, and accessories, has nine retail brands, and sells its products at\nshowrooms across the country. Foote shares insight into the company\u2019s approach\nto training and retaining their employees during a time of disruptive change.\nRead on to learn how Ferguson is partnering with Workday to create a new\nlearning strategy for its associates\u2014further developing their skill sets and\ncareers.\n\n**One of Ferguson\u2019s core values is investing in its employees. Can you tell us\na bit more about how you\u2019re doing that from a training and development\nperspective?  **\n\nFerguson stands by the saying, \u201cIf we make our associates happy, they\u2019ll make\nour customers happy.\u201d This philosophy is aligned to our approach of doing\nbusiness, which is to focus on associate and customer relationships. That\u2019s\nwhy we\u2019re continuing to invest time and extensive training in our associates\nto ensure they perform to the best of their abilities.\n\nWe had been using the same learning management system (LMS) for many years,\nwhich unknowingly got us into some ruts from a training and development\nperspective. So, we knew we needed a new learning system. At the same time, we\nwere also evaluating a new HR system. We had a separate applicant tracking\nsystem, learning management system, and a few other internal systems that we\ncould never cleanly report across. Having one system and one security model is\nhuge and saves a lot of time, and led to us selecting [Workday Human Capital\nManagement ](https://www.workday.com/en-us/applications/human-capital-\nmanagement.html)(HCM) and [Workday Learning](https://www.workday.com/en-\nus/applications/human-capital-management/learning.html). We were the first\ncompany to deploy both products at the same time.\n\n**What are some of the benefits you\u2019ve seen from having HR and learning\nmanagement in one system?**\n\nThe biggest benefit is we now have real-time access to other HCM touchpoints.\nWe no longer have to pre-plan all of the touchpoints that we\u2019re interested in\nbecause they are already available in the same system. This allows us to\nincorporate learning into our day-to-day business transactions.\n\nFor example, if one of our employees changes jobs, Workday can automatically\ndetect that the job change may require additional training. We don\u2019t have to\nsend a message to another system to trigger the learning. It also makes it\neasier for our employees to complete their training since they\u2019re already\nfamiliar with the Workday system from an HR perspective and understand how to\nnavigate its various features. It\u2019s a huge benefit when they can focus on\nunderstanding the learning versus having to learn a new system as a whole.  \n\n**How has your approach to employee learning and development changed since\ndeploying Workday?**\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is the way we think about courses. When\nsetting up a new course in our previous LMS, we\u2019d first think about the course\nname, communication skills, and then the delivery method (instructor led\nversus web based). Workday has this approach flipped\u2014it has you decide your\ndelivery method first, then the topic and title come after that. That really\nshows you that Workday has the user experience in mind first.\n\nThis approach caused us to think about our learning functionality strategy as\na whole, and we recommend others do the same. It\u2019s important to have a\nstrategy in place first so you can leverage the functionality as quickly as\npossible. You also want to make sure you have established processes to quickly\ndevelop and execute on some of the quick wins, as well as processes for the\nlarger, more involved functionality you may have to set up. That\u2019s essential\nbecause you don\u2019t want to just launch a new learning program and then stay\nstagnant.\n\n**How are you continuing to mature and evolve employee learning and\ndevelopment?**\n\nOur internal conversations have shifted from course buildout to a\ncomprehensive learning strategy. Workday has taken our learning and\ndevelopment programs to new levels. This year, we\u2019re really focused on\ndeveloping integrated modes of learning, which include self-study, virtual\ninstructor-led, and in-person sessions all in one. We\u2019ve also begun using\n[Skills Cloud](https://www.workday.com/en-us/company/newsroom/press-\nreleases/press-release-details.html?id=1588881) in our performance management\nprocess. We plan to integrate skills into our learning and job profiles so\nthat we can be more prescriptive with the type of learning programs that we\noffer our associates.\n\nWe\u2019re also excited for what\u2019s further on the horizon. We are looking forward\nto adding course surveys and building learning pathways, which are already\navailable but haven\u2019t been rolled out at our company just yet. Analytics will\nalso play a key role in ensuring that we\u2019re providing relevant content and\nidentifying and addressing any gaps we may have in our programs. We are also\nthrilled to begin our journey into user-generated content, allowing crowd-\nsourcing to capture the wisdom and experience from our field associates.\n\n_Check out a  _[ _recent webcast_](https://forms.workday.com/en-\nus/webinars/wb-ferguson-enterprises-and-workday/form.html) _  that we hosted\nwith Ferguson Enterprises to learn more about their learning transformation._\n\n_This story was originally published on the  _[ _Workday\nblog_](https://blogs.workday.com/reskilling-your-workforce-for-the-changing-\nworld-of-retail/) _.

are an indispensable resource \u2013 and in this competitive hiring\nmarket, companies can\u2019t afford turnover. So now more than ever, businesses\nmust work on retaining their best employees to ensure they\u2019re running as\neffectively and efficiently as possible.\n\nThere are many ways companies can do this, but getting started out of the gate\nwith a thorough and [welcoming onboarding\nprocess](https://www.hrmorning.com/news/5-simple-ways-to-make-your-new-hire-\nfeel-welcome/) is one of the best ways to show your employees what they mean\nto your business. They\u2019ll know that you value them and they\u2019ll be eager to\nstick around longer.\n\nOf course, onboarding can be time-consuming, but luckily, the latest [HR\ntechnology](https://www.hrmorning.com/hr-technology/) can help you establish a\nsystematized approach to onboarding while carefully monitoring all of its\nimportant aspects.\n\nHere are five ways investing on automation in your onboarding process can help\nyou retain your top talent:\n\n# Establish a single source of communication\n\nThe fast pace of modern tech development has made it difficult for companies\nto keep track of all the channels where they can find new employees.\nOftentimes, candidates will contact businesses through multiple channels when\nsearching for jobs making it challenging to track communication and new\napplicants throughout all the platforms. Additionally, it\u2019s difficult to\nassess potential employees and manage them for proper onboarding.\n\nTo help with this process, you can use software solutions like [assessment\nsoftware](https://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/solutions/assessment-software/)\nto store and manage applications in a single database. That way, you won\u2019t\nhave to work across multiple platforms.\n\n# Automate sourcing and screening tasks\n\nArtificial intelligence is making its way into various software solutions like\napplicant tracking systems, time clock software, and others. And when it comes\nto onboarding and hiring new employees, it can help HR pros immensely. Here is\nhow:\n\n## Giving responses to applicants\n\nWhen there\u2019s a large volume of applicants, like with bulk hiring, onboarding\nmanagers may find it a challenge to respond to all of them. In these\nsituations, an AI-powered onboarding software can help generate proper\nresponses and send them automatically.\n\n## Performing sourcing and screening\n\nAI software can also help with screening and sourcing. Through its\nunderstanding of job requirements, it can look for candidates that meet the\ncriteria, shortlist them and rank them properly. This allows managers to\nquickly determine which candidates to focus on first.\n\n## Getting all relevant information\n\nAI has the power to gather information about candidates and store it in a\nstructured manner. This structure makes it easier for HR reps to assess\ncandidates based on the stored data.\n\n# Evaluate candidate qualifications\n\nOne of the more tedious tasks for hiring managers is to go through many\napplications and narrow down the list to people who are qualified to do the\njob. Modern technology gives HR managers the information they need to evaluate\ncandidates based on knowledge, skills, experience, employment, history and\nother relevant information \u2013 all displayed on one dashboard. From there, they\ncan take it one candidate at a time.\n\n## Sorting applicants\n\nSome HR solutions come with features, functionalities and options that make\ntesting candidates easier, giving objective results that can tell managers\nwhether someone would be a good fit for the company. Instead of just relying\non their subjective opinions, managers can use these solutions to give\nunbiased scores and make better hiring decisions.\n\nFurthermore, these tools allow managers to sort candidates using different\ncriteria such as:\n\n    * Career achievements \n    * Portfolios \n    * Education level \n    * Various demographic factors \n    * Work experience \n\n## Selecting top candidates\n\nEven though applicants are already sorted neatly, it\u2019s important to narrow\ndown the list and choose only the candidates who best match your requirements.\nTo do this, you will have to evaluate them in a meaningful way. A software\nsolution can save time at this step by providing personalized aptitude test\nfeatures and quiz makers you can use for your evaluations.\n\n# Improve employee onboarding\n\nTechnology can help speed up the onboarding process by automating manual tasks\nthat are time-consuming. Automation allows managers to send out all\napplications and onboarding forms to new hires as soon as they get the job so\nthat employees get all the paperwork done before coming in to work. At the\nsame time, the software can send onboarding managers notifications about which\nemployees have finished their documentation and which haven\u2019t.\n\nWith these more monotonous tasks out of the way, onboarding managers can focus\non more important aspects of onboarding: They can engage new hires, tell them\nabout their new workplace and get to know them better.\n\n# Follow-up\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to make the onboarding process smooth, the story of\nretaining employees doesn\u2019t end there. After someone has joined your team,\nfollow up with proper practices to keep them engaged.\n\n## Providing employee development\n\nTo most employees, the prospect of growing as professionals and acquiring new\nskills is just as important as the work they\u2019re doing. With the help of HR\ntraining software,  or [learning management\nsolutions](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/lms-learning-management-\nsystem/), managers can instantly offer lessons, courses, and training. With\ntraining software, it\u2019s easier to create personalized training and adjust it\nto the employees\u2019 level of knowledge.\n\n## Getting feedback from your employees\n\nListening to your employees is essential as it shows that you value their\nopinions and promote transparency within your company culture. [HR training\nsoftware](https://www.proprofs.com/training/solutions/hr-training-software/)\ncan be used to gather feedback about courses and other essential issues.

Engaged employees will stay a lot longer because they find their\nwork meaningful in some way \u2013 so grabbing their attention right at the\nonboarding process will go a long way in keeping them satisfied.  \n\nIn this digital age, using modern software solutions that offer advanced\nfunctionalities can advance your business in a lot of ways.

In another recent survey, an average of 43 percent of\n[young](https://www.oecd-forum.org/users/264950-nick-\nchambers/posts/53006-young-people-don-t-feel-ready-for-the-future-of-work\n\"OECD\") people said that they were confident that they will need to retrain\nand have the ability to do so.\n\nAs revealed in the Future of Jobs Report 2018 released by the World Economic\nForum, ubiquitous high-speed mobile Internet, artificial intelligence,\nwidespread adoption of big data analytics, and cloud technology are only some\nof the drivers of change that could lead to demand for new skills and create\nthe need for continuous learning for entire workforce, irrespective of their\nindustry or domain.\n\nAs uncertain as it could get, the entire world of work has taken a hit with\n[COVID-19](https://www.peoplematters.in/tag/covid-19?utm_content=covid-19\n\"People Matters\") pandemic. Businesses across many sectors have been urged to\nnow operate remotely and quickly adapt to the new ways of working. The role of\nleaders has become most critical, they have to help the organizations and the\nentire workforce navigate through this uncertainty looming around the whole\necosystem.\n\nTo be able to navigate the complexities of the business ecosystem at present\nand in the future, as it gets more uncertain, leaders of today and tomorrow\nhave to follow the mantra of \u2018Learn, Unlearn & Relearn\u2019.\n\n### The need to learn, unlearn & relearn\n\nThe metaphor, \u2018Change is the only constant\u2019, is as real as it could get in the\nera of industry 4.0. The onus thus, comes on the business and HR leaders to\ninvest in continuous development of their workforce and ensure that they are\nalways up to date with the in-demand skills.\n\nAnurag Bansal, Senior Director and Business Head, [HUGHES Global\nEducation](https://www.hugheseducation.com/ \"HUGHES Global Education\") shared,\n\u201cIn recent times, businesses across the globe are increasingly facing complex\nproblems due to rapid changes in technology, disruptions happening through\ninnovation, turbulent market conditions and changing consumer behavior. During\nsuch uncertainty, especially, given the complexities COVID-19 pandemic has led\nto, it is very important to have leaders at the helm who can steer their\ncompanies to success in these scenarios.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted that there is a need to create agile business models,\ncollaborative needs across disciplines, and the push to drive greater\nefficiency with limited resources have become critically important for the\nbusinesses. Therefore, it's essential for leaders to strategically think and\nhave required management skills to continue driving innovation to help their\norganization be ahead of the curve.\n\nBansal has further suggested some critical management skills organizations and\nthe workforce must focus on:\n\n  * Strategic Thinking\n  * People Management\n  * Leadership\n  * Business Analytics \n  * Digital Transformation\n  * Design Thinking\n  * Business Management \n\nSome of the critical technical or functional skills depending upon their area\nof work can be:\n\n  * Business Analytics\n  * Digital Marketing\n  * Supply Chain Management\n  * Sales and Marketing\n  * Blockchain\n  * Cybersecurity\n  * Cloud Computing\n  * Internet of Things (IoT)\n  * Mobile Applications\n  * Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n\n### India Inc realizes the need for skilling\n\nPaneesh Rao, Chief People Officer, Mindtree shared with People Matters,\n\u201cTechnology is ever-evolving and therefore, it is imperative for a progressive\norganization like ours to up skill and reskill the talent pyramid to cater to\nthe changing paradigm.\u201d\n\nHe added that reskilling as a necessity gets further manifested by the lack of\navailable lateral talent which is fully equipped with the necessary skills\nkeeping pace with the emerging technologies. For example, there are 10\npositions and one candidate for each of the new technologies. In the future,\nit will be a combination of hiring one candidate externally and creating 10\nwithin the company.\n\nIn an interaction with People Matters, Satyanarayanan Visvanathan, Senior Vice\nPresident, Head of HR (Global) and Head of Corporate Quality, CSS Corp\nreiterated the same thought about the need to skill, upskill and reskill. He\nsaid, \u201cI believe in the collective wisdom of continuous learning to ensure the\nlong-term sustainable growth of the organization.\u201d\n\nBesides automation and technological disruption, it is also the newer working\nmodels like gig economy, remote working and other aspects like increased\ngenerational diversity, among others that the leaders of tomorrow need to\nprepare for.\n\nAvesh Kumar Jha, SVP \u2013 OD & PM, Hinduja Global Solutions shared with us,\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re dealing with a workforce that constitutes five generations,\nright from recent college graduates stepping into professional spheres to\nindustry veterans. Can they be handled in one single fashion? No. They each\nhave different needs and gauging this is a skill that should be acquired.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important for employees to make themselves and their team members\nrelevant to the time we\u2019re in by upskilling and reskilling continuously,\u201d Jha\naffirmed.\n\nHe further added that as the workplace narrative has changed with employees\noperating from home, remote locations, in-premise, etc., leaders need to have\nthe competencies to engage and grow them and grow with them.\n\nTo be able to maximize the opportunities the new world of work brings in\nleaders have to learn the new, unlearn the irrelevant, and relearn, for the\nlearning shall continue.\n\n### How can organizations create future-ready leaders?\n\nBansal suggests, \u201cThe first task of talent leaders is to identify which skills\nare required for which employee depending upon their current work as well as\nfuture roles and responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThey need to divide employees in two categories of skill development,\nTechnical Skills and Management skills. Those employees who are individual\ncontributors, their technical skills must be developed and for people in\nsupervisory roles or leadership roles, the focus must be on management skills.\n\nHe advises that while choosing a program for skill enhancement, it is\nessential to focus on learning outcomes otherwise the whole purpose of the\ndevelopment will fail.\n\n\u201cSo, choose development programs that have live online interaction and\nrigorous assessments and not once with recorded online lectures as part of the\ntraining just as a means to save budgets,\u201d said Bansal.\n\nOrganizations, especially business leaders and HR teams have had learning and\ndevelopment on their agenda for a long time now. But its importance has only\nincreased with time. As the entire world of work acknowledges the need to\ncontinuously invest in skilling themselves and others to be prepared, it is\nalso essential to reflect on how this culture of continuous learning could be\ndriven in practice.\n\nFrom classroom training for behavioral skills to e-learning to specialized\nexecutive leadership developments and certifications for functional skills,\nthere are many ways in which organizations today can help the employees build\nthe current in demand skills and the skills identified for the future of work.\n\n**Personalized learning**\n\n\u201cAt Mindtree, we believe in personalized learning - each person should be\nlearning what is relevant to them based on their technology domain, their\nproject and their aspirations. While the credit system ensures that learning\nhappens on a continuous basis, learners are free to learn what they choose as\nper their career and work needs,\u201d shared Rao.\n\nLeveraging technology, Mindtree has a course recommendation engine integrated\non Yorbit, a digital learning platform which generates personalized course\nrecommendations for all learners. It considers the past learnings of employees\nand core skills and generates a list of courses that would be ideal for them\nto take up next. In addition to courses, Yorbit also recommends paths &\npackages. It also has mapped out \u2018learning paths\u2019 which enable a learner to\nlearn as per their career and work goals. These paths are created by bundling\ntogether various courses into a \u2018package\u2019, which allows a learner to find and\ncomplete all relevant courses in one place.\n\n**Matching the speed of change**\n\nCSS Corp, for instance, matches the speed of skilling to the change in\ntechnology through its Digital Reskilling Framework, and grooms budding\nleaders through leadership development programs and mentor-mentee sessions.\n\n\u201cIn a dynamic and fast-paced workplace, we expect leaders to visualize future\nscenarios, be digitally savvy, and provide technological interventions without\nlosing sight of the human aspect of interactions. A sense of sensitivity or\nhuman touch during interactions is of primary importance. It\u2019s a blend of all\nof these skills and traits. Our flagship skilling ecosystem equips our\nworkforce and leadership to stay at the forefront of the industry,\u201d shared\nVisvanathan.\n\n**Learning in the flow of work**\n\nRandstad has taken another interesting approach to create a future-ready\nworkforce. Anjali Raghuvanshi, CPO, Randstad India shared how the company has\nglobally created an experimentative culture for its employees to thrive. She\nshared, \u201cWe encourage people to challenge their status quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cExperiment. Make your hands dirty. Learn something out of it. The focus is\nless on outcome and more on learning,\u201d added Raghuvanshi.\n\nBesides giving employees the opportunities to experiment, Randstad India also\nhas invested in leadership development programs, for instance, \u2018Leading\ntransformation in the digital age\u2019, a virtual learning program to help its\nworkforce across hierarchies to be digital-ready. It helps them focus on\nlearning aspects like strategic planning, strategic execution and people and\nstrategy. The program in itself is designed to challenge the thought process\nof the learner and look beyond the comfort zone.\n\nRealizing the huge demand for new ways of learning, [HUGHES Global\nEducation](https://www.hugheseducation.com/ \"HUGHES Global Education\") has\nintegrated the strengths of traditional methods of executive education in\nIndia with the latest technology, i.e. real-time Interactive Onsite Learning\n(IOL). With the help of new-age technology it created an ideal environment for\nemployees\u2019 learning experience.\n\nNo matter how much we progress as an organization and people, learning will\nremain an integral part and the journey must continue.\n\n_**\u201cThe illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and\nwrite, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.\u201d**_\n\n_**\u2015 Alvin Toffler**_\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Learning & Development](/category/compensation-\nperformance/training-development?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=training-\ndevelopment \"Browse more in: Learning &amp; Development\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Drishti Pant](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1514013807/authors/drishti-\npant.jpg)](/author/drishti-pant)\n\n#### [Drishti Pant](/author/drishti-pant)\n\nDrishti Pant is Senior Associate - Content with People Matters.

A culture of career growth now matters more than money:\n\n> Glassdoor says that 65% of Millennials consider culture over salary, and The\n> Ladders echoes this trend: 61% of employees prioritize career growth over\n> pay.\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\nIn the current economy, finding the right people is job #1. Keeping them\nrequires inventive learning and development solutions (in L&D, \"development\"\nis really short for \"career development\"). Creating a total experience\npackage, from on-boarding to the C-suite, is the new focus for savvy HR\ndepartments. Employees are demanding a\n[culture](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/15206-company-culture-matters-to-\nworkers.html) that fosters growth - and top employers are delivering bespoke\ndevelopment experiences as the differentiator that matters more than the\npaycheck.\n\nWhile your software firm may not compete for customers with the engineering\ncompany across town, you are both competing for the same high-tech talent.\nYour leadership training, culture and compassion are under consideration in a\ntight job market. And the need to differentiate, based on leadership growth,\nis creating a transformation across multiple industries.\n\nEmployees are hungry for the [leadership\ncoaching](https://westfallonline.com/consulting/leadership/) that can advance\ncareers, influence cultures and impact customers. Experiential learning is the\nonly way to really get that done. Because [information on\nleadership](http://bit.ly/leadershiplanguage) is everywhere - but _studying_\nleadership isn't the same as delivering it.\n\n[WDHB](http://wdhb.com) has run offsite leadership events for 30 years,\nprimarily in Europe, and they've recently been expanding in the U.S. They have\npioneered \"Learning Expeditions\" - tailored and curated events that bring\ntogether a diverse group of leaders, offering experiential learning\nopportunities to global organizations.\n\n**One Size That Doesn't Fit All**\n\n\"Taking an online e-course called 'Leadership Jazz,' isn't necessarily going\nto get you into the C-suite. Or keep you there,\" says Alana Vaughn-Phillips,\nan executive with WDHB in Denver. Not that online training is bad - she's\nmaking a careful distinction between leadership experience and skills-based\ntraining. [Annemie Ress](https://purplebeach.com/team/annemie-ress/), a former\nGlobal HR Director at Skype and founder of Purple Beach, agrees. \"New\ngenerations aren't into what is proposed in terms of e-learning, by most\nlearning management systems (LMS).\"\n\n\"We deliver programs in a shared way,\" Alana explains, \"where leaders see that\ntheir company cares about career growth firsthand.\" By bringing diverse\nemployees together in unique, bespoke environments, the company facilitates a\nnew experience around leadership. A big part of the learning, according to\nAlana, is [peer to\npeer](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danabrownlee/2019/08/25/peer-recognition-\nan-employee-engagement-secret-weapon/) collaboration. At WDHB, camaraderie and\nconnection is central to the overall experience.\n\n**Employees With Options**\n\nBut what about learning and development expense, when employees take that\nexperience and [go\nelsewhere](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2019/08/22/nine-\nareas-to-investigate-when-experiencing-high-employee-turnover/)? According to\n[Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/195803/employees-really-know-\nexpected.aspx), 72% of Millennials report greater engagement when clear\nperformance goals are established. Those goals need to include what the\norganization is doing, as well as what the employee is doing, regarding\nadvancement. A career path has to be a two-way street.\n\n\"When you create a unique shared experience, that's what drives loyalty,\"\naccording to Vaughn-Phillips, \"even among employees who leave. Because, when\nyou create powerful and unique leadership development experiences, often those\nemployees come back. Your chances are higher [for retention] when you deliver\nprograms that inspire evangelists within your organization. These employees\nbuild your brand and your reputation - regardless of where their career might\ntake them.\"\n\nIndustry leaders like [Google](https://www.insider.com/coolest-perks-of-\nworking-at-google-in-2017-2017-7) and\n[Heinz](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultalbot/2019/08/24/kraft-heinz-\nembarks-on-a-culture-of-creativity/) offer exceptional experiences - from\nonsite massages to wellness training to free food. But you don't have to be a\nfamous-name company in order to attract the best and brightest. Investing in\ninnovative programs for experiential learning is easier than you might think -\nand facilitating these retreats can be the first step to [elevate your team\nmembers](https://3 Ways Successful People Eliminate Conflict And Inspire\nTeams).\n\n**Are You Experienced?**\n\nLeadership is something that must be experienced in order to be delivered -\nthat's why [most online leadership\ntraining](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2019/07/04/coaching-\nmatters-how-leaders-become-better-coaches-build-stronger-teams/) programs\ndon't work. The key is to create a tailored program for your employees - one\nthat's not designed around an online curriculum, but one that focuses on the\nindividual team members.\n\nTop companies realize that [leadership\ntraining](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2019/07/25/leadership-\ntraining-without-training-wheels-whats-missing-in-executive-education/) isn't\nabout the guru at the front of the room. If you want to know if your\nleadership development program is working, don't look at the sage on the\nstage. Look at what the participants are experiencing. And measure your\nprogress.\n\nSurvey the teams that work for these leaders. Track participant's promotions\nand responsibilities. Show the organization that there is a path that works\nfor people who perform. Let current and prospective employees know that you\nhave a plan for their growth. Because leadership development is the new\npaycheck. Make sure you're ready to trade in that currency.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/westfallonline) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/westfallonline).

Click here to sign in.](https://login-\nsandbox.td.org/Company.aspx?ReturnUrl=referrer)\n\nShare\n\n[ Brought to you by ](https://www.unboxedtechnology.com)\n\nBased on what we see happening in the L&D industry, here\u2019s a look at the top\nthree trends in training and development that you need to keep your eye on for\nthe coming year.  \n\n## **Trend #1: 360-Degree Certification**\n\nWe\u2019re long past the point of a certification exam or a series of inconsistent\nclasses being enough to guarantee readiness, let alone success. The future of\ncorporate learning lends itself toward a 360-degree view of certification.\n\nBy nature, 360-degree certification is holistic. Begin by identifying a\nthreshold that learners must meet before they are considered certified. Choose\ninputs that train and test knowledge, skills, and behavior.\n\nThen, use your [learning management\nsystem](https://unboxedtechnology.com/learning-management-system-lms) (LMS) to\ncreate a unique formula of weighted inputs to automate the employee\ncertification process. Inputs may include:  \n\n  * an in-person training event\n  * video role play\n  * coaching sessions or observation\n  * mini knowledge checks.\n\nThe list could go on but each input is used in combination with the others to\ncollectively \u201ccertify\u201d your rep.\n\nDon\u2019t stop at a one-time certification. [Track employee\ntraining](https://unboxedtechnology.com/how-to-track-employee-training/) and\nrecertify reps with [refresher\ncourses](https://unboxedtechnology.com/employee-training/custom/refresher) at\nvarious checkpoints in their careers to ensure knowledge retention over time.\nReimagine how this will transform what \u201ccustomer readiness\u201d means for new\nhires and veteran employees.  \n\n##  **Trend #2: More Innovative Event Management**\n\nAn LMS that is effectively being used is an integral part of an employee\u2019s\ndevelopment. If you\u2019re not leveraging your learning platform for event\nmanagement to pulse engaging pre-work, drive community traffic, and gamify\ntraining events with ongoing opportunities to earn points and rewards, now is\nthe time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGames during training is one of those learning trends that will become more\ninfluential every year. Use games and gamification at events to educate,\nimprove the experience, and fight disengagement as well as create an\nenvironment of collaboration and healthy competition.\n\nFor example, a pharmaceutical national sales meeting is a great event to\n[impleme](https://unboxedtechnology.com/5-ways-to-utilize-e-learning-games-in-\nemployee-training/)[nt games and\ngamification](https://unboxedtechnology.com/5-ways-to-utilize-e-learning-\ngames-in-employee-training/) into. Use an LMS to award points or badges for\nvarious activities so participants can win a grand prize. Possible activities\ncan include:  \n\n  * attending various sessions\n  * tweeting what they learned using an event-branded hashtag\n  * networking with other attendees by exchanging business cards.\n\nDisengaged learners are the bane of any event\u2019s existence. The bottom line:\nCraft a learning culture that motivates and engages employees with the help of\nan LMS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## **Trend #3: Personalized Learning Through AI**\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is no stranger to L&D or the world at this point.\n\nAI at Work, a study conducted by Oracle and Future Workplace, discovered only\n6 percent of HR professionals are currently using AI in the workplace despite\nthat HR leaders believe AI will positively affect both L&D (27 percent) and\nperformance management (26 percent) over the next two years.\n\nWhen AI is implemented into an LMS, it creates a personalized learning\nenvironment that becomes more intelligent over time. AI can improve employees\u2019\nlearning experiences by:  \n\n  * identifying knowledge gaps in training then recommend the programs needed to strengthen that particular area.\n  * creating a [personalized course path using a blended learning](https://unboxedtechnology.com/blended-learning-the-way-it-should-be/) approach and selecting the right modality for training content.\n  * measuring training effectiveness through facial recognition to track what is being practically applied on the field.\n\nThe future of AI in the L&D space is limitless. If you don\u2019t start adopting AI\ntechnology into your training now, you\u2019ll be limiting the potential of your\nbusiness and employees later.  \n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [E-Learning](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=E-Learning)\n  * [Emerging Tech](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Emerging%20Tech)\n  * [Games & Gamification](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Games%20%26%20Gamification)\n  * [Learning Technologies](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Learning%20Technologies)\n  * [Tools & Platforms](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Tools%20%26%20Platforms)\n\n2 Comments\n\nSign In to Post a Comment\n\n[Sign In](https://www.td.org/sign-\nin?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.td.org%2Finsights%2F2020-training-trends-whats-\nreally-worth-your-investment)\n\n[SN](https://www.td.org/user/about/SomNanda-000001)\n\nSom Nanda\n\nJanuary 06, 2020 04:27 AM\n\nExcellent article.

become president of the Access People division\n\n**HR software provider Access Group has acquired CoreHR to create Access\nPeople, in the latest in a string of HR technology deals to be announced this\nyear.**\n\nThe acquisition of CoreHR, which serves more than 270 customers and has more\nthan one million users, follows Access\u2019 purchase of SME software provider\nPeople HR last year.\n\n## HR software at Unleash Spring\n\nHR tech conference and expo Unleash Spring will take place at London's ExCeL\non 24 and 25 March 2020. [Register for your ticket\nnow](https://unleashgroup.io/).\n\nCoreHR and People HR will be merged to form Access People, which the group\nclaimed would become one of the leading HR and payroll providers in the UK and\nIreland and will have a turnover of more than \u00a3100 million.\n\nCoreHR\u2019s products \u2013 which include people management, payroll, workforce\nmanagement, recruitment, talent management and learning software \u2013 will be\nmade available through the cloud-based Access Workspace platform.\n\nThe deal is the latest in a number of HR tech acquisitions that have been\nannounced in 2020. Last month [Kronos and Ultimate Software\nannounced](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/kronos-and-ultimate-software-\nmerge-to-form-hr-systems-giant/) they were merging to form one of the world\u2019s\nlargest HCM and workforce management software companies, while [Cornerstone\nOnDemand said it would acquire\nSaba](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/cornerstone-saba/) in a deal worth\nalmost $1.4 billion.\n\nDean Forbes, the current CEO of CoreHR, will become the president of Access\nPeople. He said: \u201cOver the past 36 years CoreHR has created a world class\nhuman capital management system, built on the expertise of our people, in\npartnership with our customers that delivers real value.\n\n\u201cAccess is fully committed to help us further enhance the depth and range of\nour products directly and via connectivity to the Access Workspace suite of\nsolutions. We are excited to be joining Access as part of the newly formed\nAccess People division and everyone in the team from Access and CoreHR are\nfully committed to helping make Access the company of choice for HCM, HR and\npayroll solutions.\u201d\n\nAccess Group CEO Chris Bayne said: \u201cCoreHR is a key player in this space and\nadds significant scope for Access to deliver even more solutions, to a broader\nrange of organisations, across multiple markets, in particular allowing us to\nbring Access Workspace to the Irish market.\n\n\u201cThe combined HCM offerings Access can now deliver will further strengthen our\nability to take a bigger share of this growing market over the coming years.\u201d\n\n##  HR Systems opportunities on Personnel Today\n\n  \n[**Browse more HR systems

But as learning evolves, tried and true methods\nare becoming old hat as innovation holds the key to employee engagement.\nRobert Blain reports.**_\n\nThe biggest single change to learning and development in recent years is\ndigitisation. This is opening up wide new vistas for learning and development\npractitioners to explore as they provide more fluid, flexible and fun options\nfor the enhancement of their organisation\u2019s employees.\n\nAnother trend that is sweeping L&D is gamification, with inventive developers\ncreating business strategy games catering to specific industries that are\ntranscending the whole concept of gamification.\n\nSectors as diverse as food and beverage (McDonald\u2019s is one eager participant)\nto big finance outfits to legal are getting involved. But more on this later.\n\n\u201cThe speed at which digital learning has grown is exponential,\u201d says Gill\nWhite, director of business at HR and people development body CIPD, when asked\nabout the single biggest change in L&D programmes in recent years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essential L&D practitioners take the time to not only understand how to\ncreate great digital assets, but that they take the time to study the\nneuroscience of learning as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s vital we understand how people actually learn, in order that we can\ncreate great learning that\u2019s \u2018sticky\u2019 and will genuinely transform skills and\nbehaviours.\n\n\u201cFor example, we now know that social engagement while online is imperative\nfor the learning process, so if you have a learning management system (LMS)\nwithout social and collaborative tools, you\u2019re hampering your people\u2019s chance\nto learn effectively.\u201d\n\nElliot Homan, APAC managing director for professional learning provider Avado,\nconcurs, adding it\u2019s essential to reinforce what is being learnt by employees\nso that it sticks.\n\n\u201cMany organisations still use traditional classroom-based learning,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re familiar with the (Hermann) Ebbinghaus (German psychologist)\n\u2018forgetting curve\u2019, then you\u2019ll understand that most people will forget 50% of\nwhat they learn if they don\u2019t put it into practice immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you couple that with the 70:20:10 concept and you see that 70% of our\nlearning comes from job-related experience, then (the best) programmes are\nbased around real-world learnings \u2013 which are interwoven with the audience\u2019s\nroles within the organisation to make sure they take away those key points\nfrom it,\u201d he adds.\n\n> **It\u2019s vital we understand how people actually learn, in order that we can\n> create great learning that\u2019s \u2018sticky\u2019 and will genuinely transform skills\n> and behaviours.**\n\n**Business strategy games**\n\nOne of the biggest buzzwords around learning and development in the workplace\nis \u201cgamification\u201d. Clearly, classroom learning in organisations has largely\ngiven way to more interactive and playful mediums.\n\nGamification is one of the ways that organisations can engage their workforces\n\u2013 from recruitment, to employee engagement, to talent development \u2013 but it\u2019s\nimportant for HR practitioners to identify what gamification is. And isn\u2019t.\n\nAccording to Vince Siu, CEO and founder of business strategy games developer\nPress Start, there are a few misconceptions surrounding gamification.\n\n\u201cThe traditional definition of gamification is to borrow concepts from games\nto spice up a product, service or campaign, which usually takes the form of\nleader boards, badges, points and levels,\u201d he says.\n\nHe believes the definition is too simple and outdated, and that there is much\nmore that can be learned from games.\n\n\u201cIf you create a fun experience at the core, then it\u2019s that much easier to\nbuild educational programmes around it,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cFun and interactivity beget replayability, and if you have a game-play\nexperience that people want to come back to \u2013 even if it\u2019s designed around the\ndriest theme out there \u2013 then you increase the chance of engagement and\nretention.\u201d\n\nCIPD\u2019s White is also a passionate advocate of the crucial role gaming should\nplay in an organisation\u2019s L&D programme.\n\n\u201cThe brain learns well in gaming environments,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIf the environment is stimulating, the amygdala (the part of the brain where\nlearning is thought to happen) is stimulated and if you are enjoying the\nexperience, dopamine is released, which is believed to encourage memory. So,\ngaming is a great environment for learning.\n\n\u201cHowever, the stimuli that makes games enjoyable can also often make them\naddictive \u2013 which we are now seeing more and more in the gaming world \u2013 so\nthere is a note of caution here too.\u201d\n\n> **Fun and interactivity lead to replayability, and if you have a game-play\n> experience that people want to come back to then you increase the chance of\n> engagement and retention.**\n\n**Business strategy games**\n\nThe next step in the evolution of L&D could well be business strategy games.\nPress Start is one company already getting in on the act and develops custom-\nbuilt business strategy games across a variety of sectors \u2013 from food and\nbeverages to finance and law. Siu believes this new wave of strategic game\nplaying is a much more effective way to engage employees.\n\n\u201cAt their core, games are a simplified version of a complex reality, condensed\ninto a playable experience via rules and logic. The components chosen, the\nmechanics used, the experience curated \u2013 these all reflect what elements are\nseen as important to a specific world, and how that world is perceived to\nwork,\u201d he explains.\n\nBy way of example, Press Start designed a card game focusing on fashion buying\nfor PolyU (the Hong Kong Polytechnic University) to use in its fashion\nbusiness programme.\n\n\u201cAt its core, it was a simulation of the actual fashion buying industry, and\nfrom many interviews with industry experts and practitioners we were able to\nget a sense of how it works on the whole \u2013 inventory management, budget\ncontrol, trend forecasting, VIP curation, the works \u2013 but condensing it all\ninto simple, playable rules was the main challenge,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe first tested it in a recruitment drive for its undergraduate programme,\nand it worked like a charm because it was quick to learn, fun to play, and\nmost importantly, simple, yet reflective of reality.\u201d\n\nThe reference to recruitment is interesting. Siu points out that this games\ntemplate can also be effectively deployed when hiring employees.\n\nPress Start also had a successful engagement with fast-food giant McDonald\u2019s\nlarge-scale McTalent recruitment drive, by customising a game based around an\n\u201centrepreneurship game and a role-playing adventure\u201d for candidates, with\noutstanding results.\n\n**EQ is the new IQ**\n\nAnother way that L&D is evolving is the trend towards soft skills. Emotional\nintelligence (EQ) is becoming a sought-after attribute and learning skills in\nareas such as conflict resolution with colleagues and customers alike, is a\nvaluable asset.\n\nAlthough, according to CIPD\u2019s White, the need to build soft skills through L&D\ndepends on specific scenarios.\n\n\u201cIt depends on what the learning outcomes are,\u201d White says.\n\n\u201cThere are compliance requirements that are quite simply \u2018black and white\u2019 in\nthe outcomes they need from the learner. But certainly, the more engaging,\nsocial and exciting learning is, the greater the chance for it to sink in and\ndrive genuine behavioural and skills changes.\u201d\n\nWhite cites David Rock\u2019s, _The Science of Making Learning Stick_ , as a great\nexample of some of the many new theories on putting together a great learning\nprogramme.\n\nWhile L&D is a standalone aspect of human resources management, it also\ntraverses all aspects of HR \u2013 from recruitment through to diversity and\nconclusion.\n\nAccording to Alisha Fernando, APAC head of diversity and inclusion at\nBloomberg, and featured in this issue\u2019s cover story: \u201cDiversity and inclusion\nneeds to be embedded into everything a business does, not just learning and\ndevelopment. But L&D, I think, plays a key role in shifting the dial.\n\n\u201cSo when we talk about D&I for an organisation, we\u2019re talking about doing\nthings differently. We\u2019re talking about shaping a new world where we haven\u2019t\nbeen before and the way that we do that is to continually develop our people \u2013\nand we do that through L&D.\u201d\n\nWhatever aspect of HR that L&D encompasses, one thing is clear: for the best\noutcomes, it should fire the imagination of those participating and be\nrelevant to your workplace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple \u2013 who doesn\u2019t like to have fun! in an era where experience is\nking, having that experience be fun, interactive and replayable makes it\nmemorable and engaging,\u201d concludes Siu from Press Start.\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

Today, the\nworld of **[learning and\ndevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/what-is-learning-and-development-objectives-strategy/)\n**encompasses a variety of elements that enable the end-to-end development of\nthe workforce.\n\nFrom soft skills training to diversity and inclusion, from behavioral change\nto mindset transformation, it is all in the hands of a company\u2019s learning and\ndevelopment professional.\n\nExpectedly, the career requirements to become a learning and development\nexpert have also changed. Apart from a technical understanding of the subject,\nyou must also be familiar with the basics of human psychology, digital\ntechnologies/tools, and change management to explore a career in this field.\n\nAnd success in this field can have an impressive payout. The average salary of\na learning and development manager in the U.S. is $65,937 per year. Add to\nthis an additional bonus and commission received on learning and development\noutcomes, which is an extra $17,526.\n\nCareer growth opportunities in learning and development are also excellent.\nTop performers have the potential to win a seat at the C-table, with most\nFortune 500 companies now onboarding a chief learning officer.\n\nSo, what are the skills you need for a successful career in learning and\ndevelopment in 2020? Let\u2019s dive right in.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **The Definitive Guide to AI in Learning and\nDevelopment**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/definitive-guide-to-ai-in-learning-and-development/)\n\n## **Soft Skills to Thrive as a Learning and Development Professional in\n2020**\n\nA learning and development career requires a smart combination of hard and\nsoft skills. Soft skills play a critical role in one\u2019s ability to aid\nworkforce learning and development.\n\nSome of the key soft skills you need in 2020 include:\n\n### **1\\. Empathy with learning clients**\n\n  \nLearning experts are often tasked with pinpointing the exact needs of their\n\u201cclient.\u201d The learning client within an organization could be a group of\ninterns, a specific department, such as sales, or individual employees in\nsenior positions.\n\nA learning and development professional must be able to empathize with the\nclient and discover learning needs that learners may not know they had.\n\nFor example, the sales team might require training sessions to boost sales\nrevenues. On the surface, a session on selling best practices could seem\nenough. But through empathy-led conversations, you may discover that the sales\nreps aren\u2019t conversant with the product\u2019s value proposition, which is holding\nback communication with the customer.\n\nThis can help you modify your training strategies and create a specific,\npersonalized program for these sales reps.\n\n### **2\\. Superior communication skills**\n\n  \nLearning experts must regularly communicate with various stakeholders across\nthe organization to pinpoint upskilling requirements, obtain buy-in, and\neliminate bottlenecks. Frequently, they must talk to employees/employee groups\nabout their skills gaps, and how they can be addressed.\n\nTherefore, a learning and development professional must be interested in and\nequipped to hold meaningful conversations about key issues.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a diverse and multigenerational workforce means that you need to\nadapt to different attitudes, perspectives, and approaches when communicating\nwith others. This makes self-confidence, communication, and heightened empathy\nessential skills to have.\n\n### **3\\. Teamwork and conflict resolution**\n\n  \nIn the course of their career, learning and development professionals will\noften have to resolve conflicts or find common ground with stakeholders with\nconflicting interests.\n\nFor example, a senior employee may be tasked with a mission-critical project\nwith a stringent deadline. But stakeholders from a different discipline may\nhave asked the employee to prioritize cross-skilling for that quarter.\n\nAs a learning and development manager, you would have to step in and resolve\nthe issue. You may have to speak to all stakeholders involved and find out\nwhat can be deprioritized.\n\nSimilarly, teamwork is a vital part of designing employee development\nstrategies. It is only by working with multiple stakeholders that you can\nformulate a learning plan that addresses every business need as well as the\nemployee's targets. ****\n\n### **4\\. Innovation/change readiness**\n\n  \nThe field of learning and development is rapidly evolving, and experts are\nexpected to keep up. From the introduction of **[learning management systems\n(LMS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-a-\nlearning-management-system-lms/)** in the early 2000s to the proliferation of\nmobile learning, self-learning for career progress via MOOCs, and now the\n**[learning experience platform\n(LXP)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/what-is-a-\nlearning-experience-platform-lxp-and-can-it-replace-your-lms/)** , the\nindustry has witnessed several changes.\n\nThe priorities and perspectives of adult learners have changed as well. Beyond\njust job-related training, people are now eager to obtain cross-disciplinary\nskills and strengthen their employability.\n\nAs a learning and development professional, you must understand and guide\nlearners/organizations through these change waves, maximizing the outcome from\neach new opportunity. Innovation-readiness will also aid in problem-solving,\nhelping to meet tricky targets and formulate out-of-the-box learning\nstrategies.\n\n### **5\\. A Shoshin mindset**\n\n  \nShoshin is a soft skill derived from Zen Buddhism that could prove\ninstrumental for your learning and development career. The word Shoshin\nessentially means \u201cthe beginner\u2019s mind,\u201d indicating one\u2019s openness to new\nideas and possibilities.\n\nEquipped with a Shoshin mindset, you will be able to identify compelling\nsolutions, articulate clearly why specific learning solutions might be\nineffective, and listen carefully to the voice of the employee. Shoshin is\nparticularly useful when adopting new technologies, as it ensures that you\nbegin with a blank slate, without any attitudinal impediments or past\ndependencies.\n\n### **6\\. Strategic vision and foresight**\n\n  \nThis is among the top soft skill requirements for any professional today, and\nit applies to learning and development careers as well.\n\nForesight can help to assess past patterns and predict how your ongoing\nlearning strategies could work out in the future. It will allow you to\nanticipate roadblocks on the way and deploy preventive/corrective actions if\nrequired.\n\nTake a simple example of a freshly graduated software developer undergoing\nsoft skills training. From previous experience, you know that this specific\nrole has traditionally relied on hard skills. The software developer may\nbecome overwhelmed by the demands of interpersonal communication after two\nmonths of the course.\n\nTo address this, you preemptively build a community of past learners who have\ntaken the course and have obtained the certification, allowing the young\nemployee to gain from more experienced peers.\n\nAs the example suggests, foresight goes hand in hand with strategic vision, so\nthat you can take the appropriate corrective action. ****\n\n## **Hard Skills You Need in Your Learning and Development Career in 2020**\n\nIn addition to empathy, communication, teamwork, foresight, change-readiness,\nand a Shoshin mindset, you also need the necessary hard skills to execute your\nlearning vision effectively. This boils down to the following four hard\nskills:\n\n### **7\\. Instructional design**\n\n  \nInstructional design was always a foundational requirement for aspiring\nlearning and development professionals. And it continues to be highly\nrelevant, especially in the early stages of your career.\n\nInstructional design is the ability to conceptualize, create, and deliver\nproducts/experiences that inform the learner. This hard skill spans\ninstructional videos, infographics, PowerPoint presentations, animations, and\na host of other visual formats.\n\nThere are several models and industry standards for instructional design, as\nwell as platforms such as Adobe Captivate and Articulate 360 geared to\ngenerate instructional content. This skill is also commonly known as\ne-learning authoring.\n\n### **8\\. Adult learning technologies**\n\n  \nAdult learning technology is a rapidly growing market, with several learning\nchannels for you to choose from. Investing in the right channel can be game-\nchanging for companies looking to upskill/reskill their workforces within a\nshort period.\n\nAn understanding of adult learning technologies, how they work, their pros and\ncons, and implementation processes can help you further your learning and\ndevelopment career.\n\nSome of the most popular adult learning technologies in use today include\nopen-source/paid LMS, blended learning (which has a human element), micro-\ncredentials, incentivized learning via digital badges, etc. Learning experts\nmust know all about these possibilities and shape the best-fit technology\nroadmap for workforce development.\n\n### **9\\. Human behavioral science**\n\n  \nWhile communication and teamwork may appear to be enough, \u201chard\u201d knowhow of\nbehavioral science and how it applies to human development is essential.\n\nEmployee learning and development is determined heavily by neuroscience and\nbehavioral science. Traits such as attention span, memory formation, and\npersonal habits play a critical role in how human beings imbibe and retain\nknowledge. By applying behavioral science theory, you can help employees\novercome the forgetting curve and make sure that your learning investments\nyield the desired results.\n\nApart from neuroscience, there is a specific field called the science of\nlearning and development, which offers useful insights into the learning\nprocess across various stages of an employee\u2019s personal and professional\ndevelopment.\n\nRooted in psychology, this hard skill can help you outline effective\nstrategies that factor in the human variance in learning experiences \u2013\nparticularly useful when combined with the study of adult learning\ntechnologies.\n\n### **10\\. Learning KPI management**\n\n  \nLearning KPI management is a branch of business analysis and basic data\nscience, which equips learning professionals to monitor, measure, and track\nkey performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nLearning KPIs can vary widely from company to company, even from one team to\nanother. Hard skills in learning data management and KPI analysis will help to\npinpoint the most relevant indices to measure learning progress.\n\nKPI skills are a useful tool in your learning and development career, as you\ncan use KPI dashboards to steer learning strategies in the right direction and\nobtain buy-in from senior leadership.\n\nKPIs convey the benefits of learning to non-HR business leaders in a tangible\nformat, clearly demonstrating its role in the overall organizational pathway.\n\nKnowledge of interpreting and analyzing data to assess, for example, where\nindividuals drop out in courses can support the skill of foresight you need to\ndevelop to prevent such situations further.\n\nMost learning and development tools available in the market today generate a\nplethora of data points, which can be analyzed with the requisite skill set.\n\n**Learn More:**\n\n## **Final #ProTip: Network at Learning and Development Events to Advance Your\nCareer**\n\nIn addition to having the right skill sets and meeting the requisite\neligibility criteria, forging meaningful relationships with industry peers can\nalso give you a leg up in your learning and development career.\n\nFortunately, social media platforms such as LinkedIn provide an exciting forum\nto exchange ideas with the world\u2019s leading learning professionals.\n\nThis paves the way to gain referrals for future positions (LinkedIn even has\nan \u201cask for a referral\" button). Interestingly, nearly half of the hires at\nsmall businesses happen via referrals, [reports\nLinkedIn](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/recruiting-tips/smb-\nattracting-top-talent). This means that the right connections can give you\nearly access to learning and development career opportunities as they open up\nin your professional network.\n\nYou can also check out learning and development events held throughout the\nyear to build even more connections:\n\n  * **Australia** \\- [Learn@Work Expo 2020](https://www.terrapinn.com/exhibition/edutech-australia/LearnWork-2020.stm) is held by EduTECH, bringing together leaders in workplace learning and adult learning technologies across the region. It is an annual event, part of the EduTech 2020 Congress Learning Streams.  \n\n  * **U.K.** \\- [World of Learning Summit](https://www.learnevents.com/conference-programme-world-of-learning-summit-2020/) is scheduled for May 15, 2020, in London.

There has\nbeen an explosion in vendors using the NGLE/LXP labels to appeal to modern\nbuyers scarred by bad historic LMS experiences. What they are is a mix of\ndisruptive ideas and new ways of delivering learning. What they are not is a\nsingle buying category, so the moment to re-classify has come.\n\n\u2018What we have seen in the last three years is a convergence in solutions where\ntraditional LMSs have upped their game in terms of next gen features for\nlearner experience, collaboration and gamification\u2019 explained David Wilson,\nCEO of Fosway.\n\n\u2018Meanwhile the next gen learning platforms have been forced to back-fill\ntraditional functionality around face-to-face training and compliance by\ncustomer demand. This meeting in the middle leaves everyone confused about\nwhat the terms mean and what they really need to support learning in their\norganisation.\u2019\n\nSo, as of 2020, Fosway is changing our classification for the 9-Grid\u2122 for\nLearning Systems to segment into suites and specialists.\n\n**Learning System Suites**  are platforms supporting and integrating a broad\nrange of traditional and next gen learning approaches. They aim to cover all\nthe main bases \u2013 traditional learning management, heightened learner\nexperience, old and new learning channels.\n\nThey are the evolution of LMSs that have added next gen and learner experience\ncapabilities, but also the evolution of the NGLEs/LXPs that have back-filled\nlearning management capability to become a \u2018one stop shop\u2019 for managing modern\nlearning.\n\n**Learning System Specialists**  are the opposite. They unashamedly focus on\none area of capability with a disruptive high impact agenda. Whether that is\nbeing the best at mobile learning, doing AI-managed adaptive delivery, or\nbuilding integrated learner experiences from multiple sources, specialists\nhave a focused proposition and want to lead the market in their chosen focus\narea.\n\nSpecialists will rarely be the only Learning System in an organisation. They\ncannot cover all the areas of learning that a company needs to manage or\nsupport. Instead their goal is to disrupt the suites and to deliver heightened\nimpact in a specific area of modern learning.\n\n \u2018It\u2019s been clear to us for some time that we needed to offer buyers greater\nclarity around learning systems\u2019 said David Wilson. \u2018Our goal is to help\nbuyers cut through some of the market hype and figure out what is a real\npriority for them, what is missing from their learning ecosystem, and which\nsuppliers might be best placed to help them.\u2019\n\nThe 2020 Fosway 9-Grid\u2122 for Digital Learning is also released today and\nreflects an ever-diversifying market filled with more choice of solution than\never before. From AI and personalisation to the continued dominance of video\nand the rise of learning in the workflow, the trends report reflects a dynamic\nbut increasingly complex level of choice for L&D.\n\n_Both reports can be downloaded online  [\n_https://www.fosway.com/research/2020-fosway-9grids-\nlearning/_](https://www.fosway.com/research/2020-fosway-9grids-learning/) and\nfind out more from the Fosway analysts in person at the Fosway Analyst Lounge\n(Stand P40) at Learning Technologies London on 12th and 13th February 2020\n_<https://www.learningtechnologies.co.uk/>__\n\n### Share this page\n\n[![Printer-friendly\nversion](https://www.trainingjournal.com/sites/all/modules/print/icons/print_icon.png)Printer-\nfriendly version](https://www.trainingjournal.com/print/6989 \"Display a\nprinter-friendly version of this page.\")\n\n## Search form\n\nSearch Form\n\n __Search\n\nSearch\n\n### [Register for our\nnewsletter](http://www.trainingjournal.com/user/register)\n\nE-mail or username *\n\nPassword *\n\nRemember me\n\n  * [Create new account](/user/register \"Create a new user account.\")\n  * [Request new password](/user/password \"Request new password via e-mail.\")\n\nLog in\n\n### Need some help with your account?\n\n[![Help!](/sites/www.trainingjournal.com/files/images/xhelp.jpg.pagespeed.ic.oP6MijqOGD.jpg)](mailto:customer.service@dodsgroup.com?subject=Training%20Journal%20account%20support%20request&body=Hi%20TJ%2C%0A%0AI'm%20having%20problems%20logging%20in%20to%20my%20account....Help!)Problems\nlogging in?

The challenge for\nfirms is to ensure L&D evolves alongside employees\u2019 needs, particularly for\nstaff working remotely.\n\nThe solution might well be in the cloud. One of the uses of cloud computing\ncan be to support career development in our fast-paced digital age.\n\u201cTechniques and methods are constantly evolving, so you need to be constantly\nlearning or you will quickly fall behind,\u201d says David White, head of project\nmanagement at Best Response Media.\n\n## Creating a learning environment\n\nOne of the major uses of cloud computing can be talent retention. Ian Cook,\nvice president for people solutions at Visier, references his firm\u2019s recent\nGender Equity report, which used cloud data to uncover a \u201cmanager divide\u201d, a\ngrowing under-representation of women, aged 32 and above, in management\npositions. \u201cThe manager divide is closely tied to the childcare years,\u201d says\nMr Cook, \u201cwhen women experience increased demands from their home life and may\neven exit the workforce as a result.\u201d\n\nAddressing this issue involves offering employees [flexible, location-\nindependent working and training](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/micro-learning-\nengagement). \u201cWe offer our 50-plus employees very flexible working\nopportunities and career progression,\u201d says Victoria Usher, founder and chief\nexecutive at GingerMay, a consultancy that uses cloud-based solutions such as\nGoogle Drive, Dropbox and Slack. Ms Usher oversees a senior leadership team\nmade up of 85 per cent working parents and which is 85 per cent female.\n\n## Professional development requires feedback\n\nEmployee performance becomes an ongoing dialogue, ensuring no employee gets\nleft behind as digital evolves evermore rapidly. One of the uses of cloud\ncomputing is to [make training part of the everyday\ninteraction](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/learner-centred-approach) between\nmanager and employee.\n\n\u201cConstant contact on feedback, training and performance makes employees feel\nthey are more engaged with the business, compared to six-month or yearly\nreviews,\u201d says Mr White. This is essential for teams with remote workers. For\nexample, managers can easily check that everyone seconded on to an important\nproject has been through the same L&D modules.\n\n> These technologies have single-handedly had the biggest impact on our\n> workforce and performance\n\nMaking the cloud the baseline technology used in training employees reflects\nhow digital has woven its way into all of our lives, making L&D more user\nfriendly. \u201cWe\u2019re all used to consuming infinite apps, content and games, and\nwe\u2019re looking for this same experience at work,\u201d says Mr Cook. \u201cThis\nconversational review cycle can help employees learn and grow more quickly,\nand keep them motivated.\u201d\n\n## Training programmes must be personal\n\nNevertheless, digitising training can\u2019t make employees learn more quickly or\nfeel completely confident in newly acquired, but untested, skills. \u201cAlthough\nour flow of feedback has grown faster, the human ability to grow and master\nskills hasn\u2019t,\u201d Mr Cook adds.\n\nWithout a structured process for managers to listen to feedback, build\ntraining plans and conduct performance reviews, implementing the cloud as the\nmain training technology can make employees feel disconnected, as though their\nwork is just disappearing into the ether.\n\n\u201cThis responsibility comes down to the manager,\u201d says Mr White. \u201cThere is\nnothing worse than giving feedback that you don\u2019t think is going to be\nlistened to.\u201d Maintaining trust in the colleagues and managers beyond the\ntraining technology remains vital.\n\n## Transformative uses of cloud computing\n\nMs Usher has seen the positive impact of utilising the cloud in her business.\nShe says: \u201cCombining multiple cloud-based solutions enables us to be a more\nattentive employer to our employees. As a result, over two thirds (68 per\ncent) of staff work part time, flexi-hours or from home.\u201d This clearly cuts\ndown on office space and costs, while leaving employees happier.\n\nMr White also believes moving training to the cloud has been transformational\nfor Best Response Media. \u201cThese technologies have single-handedly had the\nbiggest impact on our workforce and performance,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have been able\nto increase efficiencies and reduce costs at the same time.\u201d\n\nImportantly, the ability to review and analyse the impact of cloud-based\ntraining is pivotal to its success, says Mr Cook, who predicts a bright future\nfor the uses of cloud computing. \u201cJust because we have lots of content,\ndoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s actually working. Training analytics can be used to develop\nmore impactful training programmes,\u201d he says.\n\nIn addition, collecting and understanding data can help highlight dissonant\ntrends in promotion rates, performance reviews, resignation rates and so on.\nAs a result, employers will benefit from a much better understanding of their\nown organisational culture, as well as properly trained staff.\n\n# Three business leaders discuss the benefits of cloud-based employee\ndevelopment\n\n![Man on laptop](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/CB_p13_1-768x431.jpg)\n\n **1) James McAulay, founder of musician bookings platform Encore**\n\nCloud technologies have made employee development seamless and collaborative,\nand allow materials to naturally evolve as the business evolves. New recruits\nare given a set of onboarding materials called the Encore Academy.\nSpreadsheets are used to provide a framework for the onboarding. Recruits are\ngiven lists of reading material, checklists and milestones they can mark as\ncompleted during their first few weeks. The master spreadsheet links to dozens\nof other documents, which is extremely simple when everything is in the cloud.\nThis checklist can be updated by anyone in the company, as new materials and\narticles are created. Every employee at Encore has a one-to-one check-in with\ntheir manager on a fortnightly basis, with notes kept in Google Sheets. This\nmakes it easier for managers to keep track of recurring issues, and gives them\nsomewhere to note down successes they want to recognise and areas for\nimprovement between meetings.\n\n **2) Nigel Davies, founder and chief executive of intranet software provider\nClaromentis**\n\nOur people work flexibly and often from home, so everything happens in our\ndigital workplace, from product development to human resources to culture.\nThat meant e-learning was a natural fit for the way we work, but it\u2019s not\nenough to offer training in the cloud or even to assign a budget for learning.\nIt has to be cultural. We give everyone in our business a yearly budget of\n\u00a31,500 each to spend on training courses of their choice. But, finding that\nsome people weren\u2019t taking full advantage of this benefit, we decided to make\nit a bigger part of our culture. Now we encourage people to attend training\ncourses in small groups, so they get the social benefits, and to report back\nthe highlights. Our learning management system is now a bigger feature in the\ndigital workplace; people see it as soon as they login in the morning.\n\n **3) Sean Marshall, vice president for worldwide sales at ecommerce marketing\nplatform Klaviyo**\n\nOur sales leaders use the Chorus.ai platform to capture client calls, which\nare then used for group training. In monthly meetings with team members, we\nreview a series of calls, pause them where needed and then ask questions like,\n\u201cHow do you think this person handled this objection?\u201d and \u201cWhat do you think\nof the way they closed the call?\u201d It\u2019s a live forum that we can hold with our\nteam anytime we want to, on the fly. Chorus.ai lets you listen to what\nactually happened on a call, instead of asking a rep to retell it in a one on\none. We hear firsthand how customers are responding to our messaging and what\nobjections they might have. This insight is helping us to drive awesome\nimprovement in our sales team, including quarter-by-quarter increases in our\nwin rate.\n\nAlso found in [Career

Since\nevery organization has unique talent needs that evolve in tandem with business\nstrategies, the ways to manage these talent requirements need to be tailored\nas well.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the 4 steps in choosing the best-fit solution for your business.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze your needs for today and tomorrow**\n\n  \nTo judge whether an HCM software vendor is the right fit for your business\nneeds, you must first analyze what your needs are \u2013 at present and for the\nfuture. Furthermore, it helps to have a need-map of your must-have, good-to-\nhave, and great-to-have needs. Then, match this wishlist of sorts with the\nfeatures and functionalities that any solution offers.\n\n### **Step 2: Assess integration capabilities**\n\n  \nOnce you know what it is that you are looking for in an HCM software, it is\ntime to zone in on your SaaS options. Integrating all HR functions into a\nsingle HCM platform comes with assured cost benefits.\n\nThe task here is to understand which software components need to interact and\nshare data. For example, does your applicant tracking system (ATS) link into\nyour onboarding processes? The right HCM software offering will grow with your\nbusiness, and finding a solution that has the capabilities to integrate myriad\nfunctionalities and to grow is half the battle won.\n\n### **Step 3: Ascertain compliance risks**\n\n  \nWith local and federal regulations in a constant state of flux to incorporate\nand address the evolution of the business ecosystem, it is imperative to\nensure that your processes to manage your human capital are compliant. It\nhelps to stay updated on new laws and amendments, and thus, working with a\nvendor who is ready to evolve with these changes makes a big difference.\n\n### **Step 4: Appraise data security options**\n\n  \nA vendor that ensures data protection and cybersecurity and has a proven\nrecord of being able to manage both areas is a good bet. Since HCM software\nare basically powerhouses of data, strong security procedures need to be\napplied. These procedures also need to evolve with changes in data processes,\ntrends, and privacy policies.\n\nChoosing the right HCM software for your unique business needs is thus\ndependant on how well you understand these needs, the level of market research\nyou conduct to map out the pros and cons of viable options and the goals that\nyou have set for the future.\n\n**_What key features do you look for in your HCM solution?

are an indispensable resource \u2013 and in this competitive hiring\nmarket, companies can\u2019t afford turnover. So now more than ever, businesses\nmust work on retaining their best employees to ensure they\u2019re running as\neffectively and efficiently as possible.\n\nThere are many ways companies can do this, but getting started out of the gate\nto improve onboarding with a thorough and [welcoming onboarding\nprocess](https://www.hrmorning.com/news/5-simple-ways-to-make-your-new-hire-\nfeel-welcome/) is one of the best ways to show your employees what they mean\nto your business. They\u2019ll know that you value them and they\u2019ll be eager to\nstick around longer.\n\nOf course, onboarding can be time-consuming, but luckily, the latest HR\ntechnology can help you establish a systematized approach to onboarding while\ncarefully monitoring all of its important aspects.\n\nHere are five great ways investing in automation can improve onboarding and\nhelp you retain your top talent.\n\n### Establish a single source of communication\n\nThe fast pace of modern tech development has made it difficult for companies\nto keep track of all the channels where they can find new employees.\nOftentimes, candidates will contact businesses through multiple channels when\nsearching for jobs making it challenging to track communication and new\napplicants throughout all the platforms. Additionally, it\u2019s difficult to\nassess potential employees and manage them for proper onboarding.\n\nTo help with this process, you can use software solutions like[ assessment\nsoftware](https://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/solutions/assessment-software/)\nto store and manage applications in a single database. That way, you won\u2019t\nhave to work across multiple platforms.\n\n### Automate sourcing and screening tasks\n\nArtificial intelligence is making its way into various software solutions like\napplicant tracking systems, time clock software, and others. And when it comes\nto onboarding and hiring new employees, it can help HR pros immensely. Here's\nhow:\n\n#### Giving responses to applicants\n\nWhen there\u2019s a large volume of applicants, like with bulk hiring, onboarding\nmanagers may find it a challenge to respond to all of them. In these\nsituations, an AI-powered onboarding software can help generate proper\nresponses and send them automatically.\n\n#### Performing sourcing and screening\n\nAI software can also help with screening and sourcing. Through its\nunderstanding of job requirements, it can look for candidates that meet the\ncriteria, shortlist them and rank them properly. This allows managers to\nquickly determine which candidates to focus on first.\n\n#### Getting all relevant information\n\nAI has the power to gather information about candidates and store it in a\nstructured manner. This structure makes it easier for HR reps to assess\ncandidates based on the stored data.\n\n### Evaluate candidate qualifications\n\nOne of the more tedious tasks for hiring managers is to go through many\napplications and narrow down the list to people who are qualified to do the\njob. Modern technology gives HR managers the information they need to evaluate\ncandidates based on knowledge, skills, experience, employment, history, and\nother relevant information \u2013 all displayed on one dashboard. From there, they\ncan take it one candidate at a time.\n\n#### Sorting applicants\n\nSome HR solutions come with features, functionalities and options that make\ntesting candidates easier, giving objective results that can tell managers\nwhether someone would be a good fit for the company. Instead of just relying\non their subjective opinions, managers can use these solutions to give\nunbiased scores and make better hiring decisions.\n\nFurthermore, these tools allow managers to sort candidates using different\ncriteria such as:\n\n    * Career achievements \n    * Portfolios \n    * Education level \n    * Various demographic factors \n    * Work experience \n\n#### Selecting top candidates\n\nEven though applicants are already sorted neatly, it\u2019s important to narrow\ndown the list and choose only the candidates who best match your requirements.\nTo do this, you will have to evaluate them in a meaningful way. A software\nsolution can save time at this step by providing personalized aptitude test\nfeatures and quiz makers you can use for your evaluations.\n\n### Improve employee onboarding\n\nTechnology can help speed up the onboarding process by automating manual tasks\nthat are time-consuming. Automation allows managers to send out all\napplications and onboarding forms to new hires as soon as they get the job so\nthat employees get all the paperwork done before coming in to work. At the\nsame time, the software can send onboarding managers notifications about which\nemployees have finished their documentation and which haven\u2019t.\n\nWith these more monotonous tasks out of the way, onboarding managers can focus\non more important aspects of onboarding: They can engage new hires, tell them\nabout their new workplace and get to know them better.\n\n### Follow-up\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to make the onboarding process smooth, the story of\nretaining employees doesn\u2019t end there. After someone has joined your team,\nfollow up with proper practices to keep them engaged.\n\n#### Providing employee development\n\nTo most employees, the prospect of growing as professionals and acquiring new\nskills is just as important as the work they\u2019re doing. With the help of HR\ntraining software,  or[ learning management\nsolutions,](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/lms-learning-management-\nsystem/) managers can instantly offer lessons, courses, and training. With\ntraining software, it\u2019s easier to create personalized training and adjust it\nto the employees\u2019 level of knowledge.\n\n#### Getting feedback from your employees\n\nListening to your employees is essential as it shows that you value their\nopinions and promote transparency within your company culture. [HR training\nsoftware ](https://www.proprofs.com/training/solutions/hr-training-\nsoftware/)can be used to gather feedback about courses and other essential\nissues. This information is then shared privately with the manager.\n\nEstablishing good onboarding practices will not only help your business handle\nthe hiring process more efficiently, but it will also help you choose the\nright people and [retain them](https://hbr.org/2012/11/five-ways-to-retain-\nemployees). Engaged employees will stay a lot longer because they find their\nwork meaningful in some way \u2013 so grabbing their attention right at the\nonboarding process will go a long way in keeping them satisfied.  \n\nIn this digital age, using modern software solutions that offer advanced\nfunctionalities can advance your business in a lot of ways. While it can be a\nbit of an investment, training software and onboarding platforms will pay for\nthemselves in the end by freeing up busy HR professionals to focus on the more\n\u2018human\u2019 elements of the job.  \n\n__________________\n\n![Kamy Anderson, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Kamy\nAnderson, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Kamy\nAnderson, HR Expert Contributor](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/andersonbio-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Kamy Anderson, HR Expert\nContributor](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/kamyandersonhrmorning-com/)\n\nKamy Anderson is an ed-tech enthusiast with a passion for writing on emerging\ntechnologies in corporate training and education.

organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n## **Is Your Onboarding Strategy on Point?**\n\nHaving a stellar [onboarding\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/) is critical to\n[employee retention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/).\nAccording to research by Jobvite, a significant portion of your new hires is\nlikely to quit in just 90 days after joining their role. This makes the\nonboarding experience a key differentiator in how they perceive a company,\nengage with the job, and stay involved (or not) with your business objectives.\n\nAnd here are a few more metrics that drive home the need for a smart\nonboarding experience strategy. These findings are from a SilkRoad Technology\nreport titled U.S. Trends and Applications in **[Employee\nOnboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/)** , published earlier in 2019:\n\n  * 65% of employees say that an onboarding program helps to prepare for the next step in their career trajectory\n  * Organizations with a clearly outlined [onboarding process](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) enjoy 82% higher new employee retention, as well as a 70% uptick in productivity\n  * The average recruit must go through 54 different activities as part of their onboarding experience, suggesting a marked degree of complexity\n\n  \nAs we approach 2020, it is time to rethink the onboarding experience with a\nfocus on candidate engagement and long-term retention. Remember, the lessons\nlearned and the impressions made during these early days will be critical in\ndetermining whether top talent decides to stay on with your company.\n\nAn intelligent onboarding experience strategy, informed by a set of key best\npractices, will help you maximize each new resource that becomes part of your\nworkforce. Let\u2019s look at how to improve the onboarding experience in 2020,\nwith trends and examples to illustrate the way forward.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n## **How to Improve the Onboarding Experience: 10 Strategies to Remember**\n\nThe world\u2019s leading companies are now squarely focused on delivering the best\nonboarding experiences possible. Interestingly, this goes beyond the offer\nacceptance and joining stage \u2013 from the moment a candidate seriously considers\nyour organization as a potential employer, you should focus on having a\n**[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/)** strategy that\ntranslates into a stellar onboarding experience. Here are ten tips to help\nimprove your onboarding experience in 2020, minimizing early [attrition\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nattrition-complete-guide/)and disengagement risks.\n\n![10 ways to improve the onboarding experience for your new\nhires](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. 10 ways to improve the onboarding experience for your new hires**\n\n### **1\\. Make learning & development (L&D;) central to the onboarding\nexperience **\n\n  \nOnboarding is all about equipping a recruit to bring their very best to a\nworkplace from day one. If they spend weeks or even months familiarizing\nthemselves with your company, exploring self-service capabilities, and\nfiguring out how to complete routine tasks, they are being far less productive\nthan they can be.\n\nThis is why L&D; is vital for an enriched onboarding experience \u2013 learning\nmodules on essential software, short one-on-one sessions with a line manager,\nand pre-recorded videos on company values/ethics can go a long way in helping\nrecruits overcome their teething troubles.\n\nFor example, U.S.-based Hormel Foods Corporation adopted this strategy to\nredesign onboarding experiences in 2019. It deployed a gamified platform\ncalled Discovery Map\u00ae to allow new hires to learn information about the\ncompany quickly. This earned them the Silver Stevie Award in the Achievement\nin New Employee Onboarding category in 2019 as one of the best onboarding\nexperiences.\n\n### **2\\. Find innovative ways to inspire collaboration**\n\n  \nThere\u2019s no way around it. Collaboration is the cornerstone of engagement, and\nby inspiring recruits to collaborate with the workforce from day one, you can\nsubstantially improve the onboarding experience. There are many ways to do\nthis. For example, by scheduling an \"Onboarding Day\" every month/two months\ndepending on the size of your company, you can urge recruits to talk, share\ninsights, and resolve any concerns they may have about their future workplace.\n\nFor single-recruit onboarding experiences, you can invite participation from\nvarious stakeholders across the company, including team leads, vertical heads,\nand even C-level executives. Problem-solving exercises, quizzes, and\nquestionnaires are a great way to embed collaboration into your onboarding\nexperience.\n\nOne of the best onboarding experiences that leverages this collaborative model\nis practiced by Pinterest. The company\u2019s Knit SF onboarding strategy follows\nthe principles of knitting \u2013 using the term to refer to the collaboration of\npeople across the organization during the onboarding process. Activities like\npeer-to-peer icebreakers, candid chats with cross-disciplinary team leaders,\nand joining the company\u2019s Slack thread fall under this Knit SF framework. New\nhires are taken through all the departments of the organization to understand\nhow each function.\n\nIt also helps that despite having offices across the world, all new hires at\nPinterest begin their onboarding experience at the San Francisco headquarters.\n\n**Also Read:** **[10 Employee Onboarding Checklist Items You Can't Afford to\nMiss](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/employee-\nonboarding-checklist/)**\n\n### **3\\. Drive hiring managers to take greater ownership of the onboarding\nprocess**\n\n  \nBecause the onboarding experience involves multiple stakeholders across the\ncompany, there\u2019s always the risk that hiring managers may overlook a few key\ndetails. This challenge is compounded by the fact that onboarding is only one\ncomponent of a hiring manager's daily itinerary.\n\nAn excellent way to address this is by creating **[onboarding\nchecklists](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/employee-onboarding-checklist/)** that clearly lay out all the\nsteps required to improve the onboarding experience. Organizational leaders\ncan work together with the internal marketing team to schedule email updates\nthat inform and inspire hiring managers to take ownership.\n\nFor example, Google sends a manager \u201cjust in time\u201d onboarding checklists to\nassist with the onboarding experience. The company shares this list only 24\nhours before the recruit\u2019s arrival, ensuring a sense of immediacy and urgency.\nSome of these tasks on this list include having discussions with the new hire,\nassigning them a peer buddy, building a social network, setting up regular\ncheck-ins, and having transparent dialogues to identify how they feel about\nworking there.\n\nWith only one day to prepare, the manager is more likely to remember and focus\non each component. This small change to Google's onboarding experience\nstrategy improved results from onboarding by 25%.\n\n### **4\\. Integrate all the touchpoints on the employee onboarding journey**\n\n  \nAs mentioned, the typical employee must go through numerous activities and\nprotocols before they can complete the onboarding process. This can sometimes\nbe a fragmented experience, lowering the recruit's capability to remember and\nact on the information gained during onboarding. Integration of onboarding\ntouchpoints such as L&D;, admin, compliance, and workforce management could\nhelp to improve the onboarding experience significantly.\n\nFor example, instead of providing multiple hard copies for photographs for\ndocumentation, and then receiving an employee ID, the recruit can take a\nselfie or share a digital photo that\u2019s reused across various departments. Not\nonly does this dramatically cut down the onboarding timeline, but it also\nenhances the overall quality of experience.\n\nDell Boomi recognized the impact of this onboarding experience strategy after\nsurveying its employees last year. It found that 74% of the workforce didn\u2019t\nreceive a laptop on day one, and it took an average of 92 days before gaining\naccess to key applications and information.\n\nSo, the company developed an Onboarding Solution Accelerator that could\nresolve fragmentation in onboarding experiences by leveraging remote access,\nmobile competencies, and automation. Thanks to what is one of the best\nonboarding experiences we have seen so far, Dell saved 3.4 hours in admin\neffort per recruit and $5,600 in annual costs.\n\n### **5\\. Initiate the onboarding experience before the recruit steps into the\noffice**\n\n  \nEvery recruiter has undoubtedly come across this scenario: after a rigorous\nscreening process and negotiations, the offer is rolled out and accepted. But\nthe recruit changes their mind a few days before the joining date. This leads\nto massive sunk costs and overall inefficiency in your talent acquisition\npipeline.\n\nTo address this, it is crucial to extend the onboarding experience beyond the\noffice premises. By engaging with the recruit immediately after the offer\nacceptance, you can alleviate everyday worries (commute, career progressions,\ndiversity, etc.) and ensure that they do not look for greener pastures\nelsewhere.\n\nThat\u2019s why preboarding is now among the top onboarding experience strategies\nfor employers across the globe.\n\nWhen a high-tech electronics firm saw that an increasing number of recruits\nwere dropping off after receiving an offer, they started thinking about how to\nimprove the onboarding experience for their new hires.\n\nOne of the measures it took was designing a preboarding package that was\nmailed to the employee\u2019s home address. It included a company video,\ntestimonials by future colleagues, and detailed descriptions of the benefits\nthey could expect at the company.\n\nOnboarding experience best practices like this ensure that a recruit stays\nengaged with your organization until every formality has been completed.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Do You Measure These 5 Onboarding\nMetrics?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-five-onboarding-metrics/)\n\n### **6\\. Analyze the unique needs of varying recruit demographics**\n\n  \nThis is one of the key steps to improving your onboarding experience \u2013 not\nevery recruit will come with similar expectations, and the onboarding\nexperience cannot follow a one-size-fits-all model. There may be instances\nwhere engagement and community building should be at the forefront of the\nonboarding process.\n\nIn other cases, the experience should ideally pivot around the exchange and\ndissemination of information. Employers should conduct preboarding surveys to\ndetect these requirements early on, ensuring that the onboarding experience is\nin line with the recruit\u2019s individualized expectations.\n\nKPMG Belgium demonstrated a great example of this onboarding experience\nstrategy in action. The organization hires 170 graduates every year, in\naddition to 150 experienced hires. KPMG leveraged a combination of preboarding\npractices, content delivery systems, and process automation to improve the\nonboarding experience for these two unique categories.\n\nGiven that the cost of replacing a new graduate recruit could run up to 80% of\ntheir annual salary, you must try to deliver the best possible onboarding\nexperience to these young, ambitious professionals.\n\n### **7\\. Explore onboarding models for temporary and seasonal workers**\n\n  \nThe quality of the onboarding experience is as important for your temporary\nand seasonal workers as it is for employees joining the permanent company\npayroll. For sectors such as media and entertainment, retail, and healthcare,\nthe contingent workforce takes up a large part of their onboarding\ninvestments.\n\nA more efficient and optimized experience in this segment can help to deliver\nbetter results and save costs. It isn\u2019t enough to have temporary and seasonal\nworkers sign an offer and join the job \u2013 these are individuals who will be\nadvocates for your employer brand, who can effectively promote it to hire more\nworkers \u2013 even urgently if needed.\n\nA paper-based non-experience-focused onboarding journey brings down the\npossibility of a temporary worker choosing to work for you a second time\naround.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America (Denver) offers one of the best onboarding\nexperiences to its massive group of seasonal workers who join every year to\nstaff their summer camp. The company initially had a paper-driven, manual\nprocess where HR would go through every file to identify returning staff and\ncreate new folders for fresh recruits. This process took weeks to complete.\n\nBoy Scouts of America recently switched to an automated onboarding process\nthat doesn't require recruits to be physically present to furnish the\npaperwork. Owing to this new onboarding experience, the organization saved 48+\nhours in admin efforts and ensured a happier contingent workforce.\n\n### **8\\. Harmonize onboarding experiences across multiple locations**\n\n  \nProviding a consistent onboarding experience has always been a challenge for\nglobal/large-scale companies. Once the\n**[recruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-recruitment/)** process and offer rollout are over,\nregional offices follow their own practices until the recruit joins the\norganization. This could lead to a fragmented experience, dependent on the\ninterest and expertise level of local HR managers.\n\nTo achieve the same level of success across locations, it is essential to\nformulate a clear onboarding experience roadmap with strategic checks and\nbalances in place. This will also make it easier to introduce changes/upgrades\nto your onboarding model without requiring any major overhaul at each\nlocation.\n\nGlobal beverages company Bacardi provides a great example of this onboarding\nstrategy at work. Previously, Bacardi struggled with a different experience at\neach site, risking inefficient onboarding journeys at locations that were\nunderstaffed.\n\nTo improve the onboarding experience, the company now uses pulse surveys to\nshare and collect data over a 90-day welcome period. A buddy system and\nmandatory training are the other components of Bacardi\u2019s global onboarding\nprocess, which creates a seamless onboarding experience no matter where\nemployees join the company.\n\n### **9\\. Blend employee onboarding with continuous learning**\n\n  \nThe transition from the onboarding process (which can last from anywhere\nbetween two days and three months) to on-the-job practice, must be seamless.\nIt can be beneficial to measure employee skills at the time of joining and map\nhow it improves over time via onboarding as well as continuous learning.\n\nThe concept of **[strategic\nonboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/strategic-onboarding-plan-2019/)** involves the \u201ccontinuous\nonboarding\u201d of employees \u2013 a long-term strategy to keep employees engaged and\nrelevant for new positions within the company. It can even prepare them for\nleadership positions in the future. This can help you boost productivity and\nhelp employees reach their professional targets faster.\n\nO\u2019Shea Builders uses this onboarding tactic to raise the quality of talent in\nthe organization over time. At O\u2019Shea, onboarding and career development are\npart of the same process, guiding each employee through organizational and\ncareer goals. This is broken down into a two-part onboarding process, where\nthe first deals with new hire training and the second ask employees to define\nspecific development goals for themselves.\n\nThanks to customizable workflows and trackable progress, 83% of employees at\nO\u2019Shea Builders reported they were very satisfied with the onboarding and\ncareer development experience at the company.\n\n### **10\\. Factor in offboarding requirements right at the time of\nonboarding**\n\n  \nWith the average employment tenure gradually shrinking, your offboarding\nnumbers are likely to go up over the years. And the impressions made during\nthis crucial part of the employee journey will determine if they return to\nyour company, refer their acquaintances, and present your employer brand on\nsocial media.\n\nIt is advisable to take the data gathered during onboarding to frame an\nindividualized offboarding strategy. Apart from standard procedures in\ncompliance and admin areas, pulse surveys, one-on-one conversations, and a\ndiscussion on future opportunities are critical to offboarding.\n\nFor example, email automation startup Mailigen places offboarding at the heart\nof its employee-centric culture. The company realized that ineffective\noffboarding could result in sizeable costs, as rehiring an ex-employee is\noften better for business than looking for a new one. That\u2019s why Mailigen\ntreats the employee journey like any other relationship, where the\norganization must take care of first impressions, regular interactions, as\nwell as the closure to ensure the employer brand is maintained.\n\nThis is in addition to following the other onboarding experience strategies\nlisted above, including integration, collaboration, and an unwavering eye on\nengagement.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Top 10 Employee Onboarding Software for\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nemployee-onboarding-software/)\n\n## **Avoid These Pitfalls When Onboarding in 2020**\n\nThere are still a lot of wrinkles to be ironed out when it comes to improving\nonboarding experiences. Research by ServiceNow found that nearly a quarter of\nemployees receive no clear onboarding, and the company didn't note that it was\nan employee's first day in one out of ten cases.\n\nIf you\u2019re eager to learn how to improve onboarding experiences and deliver the\nbest onboarding experience to your 2020 recruits, make sure to avoid these\ncommon pitfalls:\n\n  * No alignment between onboarding and the reality of the job\n  * Giving the recruit full ownership for the first day, with zero handholding\n  * Setting performance benchmarks that become active without a transition period\n  * Information overload and exposure to a high number of technology platforms\n\n  \nSo these are among the top onboarding experience strategies that belong on\nyour radar as you look forward to a new year, marked by hiring success and\ncontinued engagement. As exemplified by these ten companies with the best\nonboarding experiences, the early days of an employee\u2019s journey are probably\nthe most formative, setting up the groundwork for a productive tenure at your\ncompany.\n\n_What measures have you taken to improve onboarding experiences in 2020?

It's\nturning into an experience department.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nThe simple answer is today workers want something more than a pay check.\nThey're looking for more than a title.  They're looking for the experience of\nwork.  It sounds funny when said in that way, but it's not a matter of going\nto work for an organization and learning how to do a job\u2026 then moving on when\nthe employee is no longer challenged.  It means so much more.\n\nWhen a person takes a job with a company, they are looking for purpose,\nbelonging or a mission.  And if that's not enough, they want to engage with\nfellow co-workers and build relationships.  They want to take on projects\neither solo or in a team atmosphere and get them off the ground.  They want to\nsucceed.  They want to work in an environment that is innovative and one where\npeople are allowed to fail.  These are all part of the [employee\nexperience](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/articles/crafting-an-employee-experience-program).\n\nSo, what does HR look like in this new world?\n\n# Employee Experience Business Case\n\n## Defining EX\n\nAnyone who has ever held a job has had an \"employee experience.\"  Notice the\nstatement does not include the word \"same\" when defining the experience.  To\nfurther add credence to this, if a worker walked around his or her office and\ninterviewed co-workers on the subject, specifically asking those individuals\nto define the term employee experience, the results would vary in detail.  It\nwould be fair to say the worker would not be any closer to defining or fully\nunderstanding the concept.\n\nSo where to begin?\n\nIt started in the 1990s with the concept of employee engagement.  More than\ntwo decades later, there is an entire industry of study and analysis dedicated\nto the concept and it has massive influence on the way companies think about\ntheir employees.\n\n> WEBINAR:  [Reviving the Employee Experience with\n> Culture](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-compensation-\n> benefits/webinars/reviving-the-employee-experience-with-culture)\n\nBut a shift away from employee engagement is happening.  According Statista,\nin 2019, about 66 percent of employees worldwide were engaged in their work.\n\nFor those that aren't engaged, Gallup says it's cost companies worldwide\napproximately $7 trillion in lost productivity.\n\n> \"In a nutshell, this global engagement pattern provides evidence that how\n> performance is managed, and specifically how people are being developed, is\n> misfiring.\" Gallup\n\nWhen this statement is coupled with the reality that people in the workforce\nnow are looking for purpose, developmental opportunities, and accept the\ninterconnectivity of work and life, one could see the reason for moving toward\nan employee experience strategy.\n\n## Addressing the Challenge\n\nIn Deloitte's Global Human Capital Trends report release in 2017, the research\norganization found 80% of executives feel staff experience as being important\nor very important.  That said, however, only 22% feel their respective\ncompanies are good at building a unique experience for everyone.  Worse still,\nnearly 60% say their companies aren't ready to address the challenge.\n\nHow does a company start to change these perceptions?  One sector to focus on\nwould be learning.  In fact, companies should focus their respective learning\nstrategies on training and support, manager development, self-directed and\ndynamic learning.\n\n### Training and Support\n\nThe nature of work continues to change, and it's happening at a pace that\nmakes it rather difficult to for HR professionals to keep up.  Take job\ndescriptions for instance.  They are evolving into living documents meaning\nthey are always changing with necessity of the working universe.  They evolve\ninto new roles, tasks, and responsibilities.  And if the change doesn't\nhappen, the job may seem to be less relevant.\n\nAs a result, employees want and need continuous training and support.  This\nallows them to fell constantly equipped to do their jobs and do them well.\n\neLearning, and advancements in that space such as microlearning and on-demand\ntraining, allows the employee the ability to access the information whenever\nthey need it.  This makes learning personal and convenient to the employee\nexperience.\n\n#### The State of HR\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/state_of_hr_cover_small.jpg)\n\nThe State of HR is in transition.  The days of being merely transactional are\nextinct and the evolution of the strategic HR department is underway.  So,\nwhat shape will the future take?  Where will the focus lie in order to achieve\nsuccess?  Find out in our latest report:  The State of HR.\n\n[Learn More](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/reports/the-state-of-\nhr/?utm_source=Inline_Ad&utm_medium=Portal&utm_campaign=HRIQ-20-State%20of%20HR%20Report&utm_term=&utm_content=&disc=&extTreatId=7503447)\n\nWalmart is one of the largest distribution networks in the world.  It makes\nmillions of products globally.  That brings up some hefty safety challenges.\nTo put this in perspective, just a 5% decrease in incidents translates to\nmillions of dollars in savings.  To help make this a reality, Walmart created\na microlearning program that not only kept safety on top of employees' minds,\nbut it also improved employee knowledge and retention regarding safety\npractices.\n\nWalmart's program took the form of a game.  It was made available to 150+\ndistribution centers and more than 75,000 employee had access to it.  At any\ntime during a work shift, an employee could log on to the platform and spend\n3-5 minutes playing a game that involves answering safety questions.  The\nsystem tracks their answers and gives them feedback.  As such, it gives\nemployees the knowledge of where they need improvement and reinforces the\nknowledge they've already mastered.\n\nWalmart saw a voluntary participation rate averaging about 91%.  They saw a\n54% reduction in safety incidents and a 15% increase in employee knowledge\nabout safety.\n\n### Manager Development\n\nIt's been said the number one reason employees leave a company is because of\npoor relationships with managers.\n\nManagers are pivotal when it comes to the employee experience.  To be more\nprecise, a manager's style and their decisions have a significant impact.\nIt's for this reason that developing managers to understand how to engage and\ninspire employees is important to the overall employee experience strategy.\n\nBy investing in managers through flexible, self-driven, and on-demand training\nprograms, these individuals will learn how to manage the employee experience.\n\nLook no further than Pandora as an example.  The HR department at the company\nclosely tracks two key employee metrics that measure the strength of employee-\nmanager relationships:\n\n  1. My manager really cares about me as a person.\n  2. I would recommend my manager to others.\n\nBased on this data, Pandora teaches manages how to coach, support, and manage\ntheir people.  The company creates all of its own content and training tools\nfor managers\u2026 all geared toward promoting Pandora's values and culture.  The\ncourses are required and are all available online and on-demand.  Each session\ntakes less than 15 minutes to complete.\n\n> RELATED:  [Employee Engagement - Everything You Need to\n> Know](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\n> engagement/articles/employee-engagement-everything-you-need-to-know)\n\nUniversity Federal Credit Union also utilizes its managers to help with\nemployee engagement and experience.  Jaclyn Courage is the Organizational\nDevelopment Specialist for the company.\n\n\"The biggest challenge that I see is from a manager point of view; helping our\nmanagers to see that given that even their current level of busyness that\nwe're not actually asking them to do anything in addition to things that they\nare already doing,\" Courage said.  \"Employee engagement is not separate or\ndifferent from the ongoing conversations that they're already having.   It's\njust a more focused conversation.\"\n\nCourage further explained managers are development by and have access to\n\"practical, simple tools they can easily apply.\"\n\n### Self-directed and Dynamic learning\n\nIt's been stated numerous times that we live and work in a digital world.  Why\nnot learn in it too?\n\nLearning management systems can help develop and curate accessible and\nrelevant content employees can use to direct their own learning and personal\nexperience.  This is a far more agile, convenient, dynamic, and relatable tool\nfor employees who are already functioning in a digital world.\n\nThomson Reuters is a company made up of 60,000 employees in 100 different\ncountries.  With so many employees located in different countries and time\nzones, with each having different training needs, it becomes an extremely\ncomplex training challenge.\n\nThe news organization turned to a learning management system that allowed them\nto customize the content in different languages.  It was also made sure that\nemployees could access learning materials through a variety of mobile devices.\n\n## In summation\n\nJacob Morgan, author of _The Employee Experience Advantage_ , writes that \"[as\nwe shift to the future of work, where organizations are focusing on the\nreasons why employees _want_ to work versus _need_ to work, it is important to\nunderstand employee\nexperience.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2016/04/22/what-is-\nemployee-experience/#1a0c384a7386)\"  Morgan further explains that every\nemployee experience is comprised of three components:  cultural,\ntechnological, and physical.  All three components together need to create an\noverall environment, \"where people want to show up!\"\n\nKnowing that, companies need to take a hard look at the tools and procedures\nthey have in place that support and enhance employee connectivity.  This will\nallow employees to feel connected to their co-workers and their company.\n\n[Human resources professionals must develop a\nculture](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/articles/how-\nyour-culture-can-support-ex) of streamlined communications.  It must eliminate\nfriction between employees allowing for connectivity, empowerment, and\nalignment.  At the same time, the right technology must be in place to connect\nand engage employees regardless of where they are and how they collaborate.\n\nWhen all of this is said and done, the HR department will be in the best\nposition to drive company success.\n\n\n\n> NEXT:  [The Employee Activated Culture and Its\n> Benefits](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\n> engagement/articles/employee-activated-culture-and-its-benefits)\n\n\n\n**_Want more content faster?

That challenge also explains some of the motivation for\nCornerstone OnDemand Inc.'s just-announced acquisition of Saba Software Inc.\nfor nearly $1.4 billion.\n\nTogether, the two companies create a significant learning management firm,\nserving a total of 75 million users at some 7,000 organizations globally. It\ngives Cornerstone access to Saba's engineering and technical talent,\naccelerating its own development. It also takes a competitor out, according to\nanalysts.\n\nThe two firms also offer product sets that serve broader HR needs, such as\nrecruiting, onboarding and performance management systems. But they are both\nknown for their [learning management\nsystems](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/learning-management-\nsystem) (LMSes).\n\nLearning was the [top trend\ncited](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252463992/HR-struggles-to-\nimprove-workforce-experience) in Deloitte's most recent Global Human Capital\nTrends Report. Additionally, nearly 200 major U.S. firms released a statement\nlast year pledging, in part, [to invest in\nemployees](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/CEO-commitment-to-\nupskilling-employees-may-boost-HR-tech) by \"supporting them through training\nand education that help develop new skills for a rapidly changing world.\"\n\nThe Cornerstone acquisition of Saba creates product overlap. In a conference\ncall with financial analysts, Cornerstone CEO Adam Miller identified \"more\nthan $35 million\" in \"cost synergies\" and expects to identify millions of\ndollars more. That usually means cutting.\n\nCornerstone isn't giving interviews until the deal closes, which is expected\nto happen sometime in the second quarter, a spokeswoman said. But industry\nanalysts have some good ideas about what's ahead.\n\n### __A look at what's ahead\n\n> Essentially this takes out a competitor on the learning management front.\n> **Lisa Rowan** Chief HR analyst, IDC  __\n\nAny merger-related reductions will be in back-office operations and not in the\nengineering and development areas, industry analysts said. Indeed, Miller said\nthat \"a key bottleneck\" for his firm \"has been engineering capacity.\" The\n[Saba](https://searcherp.techtarget.com/feature/Hyatt-transforms-employee-\ntraining-with-Saba-online-learning-software) acquisition fixes that, and will\nspeed up its innovation efforts, he said.\n\nFor users of Cornerstone and Saba, what Miller shared with IDC is that\n\"innovations will be driven to the Cornerstone products, not the Saba\nproducts,\" said Lisa Rowan, chief HR analyst at IDC. \"Cornerstone is going to\ntake two-thirds of the Saba R&D team and direct it toward development on\nCornerstone offerings.\"\n\n\"Essentially this takes out a competitor on the learning management front and\nredirects the endeavors of that competitor onto the Cornerstone portfolio,\"\nRowan said.\n\n![Josh\nBersin](http://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/bersin_josh_02.jpg)Josh\nBersin\n\nThe plan is for Cornerstone to become the strategic platform for all Saba\ncustomers, so over time the Saba customer base will migrate to Cornerstone,\nsaid [Josh Bersin](https://joshbersin.com/2020/02/cornerstone-acquires-saba-a-\nmarket-leader-acquires-a-pioneer/), an independent HR analyst.\n\n![Holger\nMueller](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/mueller_holger.jpg)Holger\nMueller\n\nThis is a consolidation of the legacy learning management systems market,\nBersin said. \"Cornerstone is now clearly the No. 1 player, and that's a big\nopportunity for them,\" he said.\n\nCornerstone's acquisition of Saba saves the firm \"four to six years of growth\nto get where they are now as a combined company,\" said Holger Mueller, vice\npresident and principal analyst at Constellation Research.\n\nLearning \"is all about serving the right content at the right time,\" Mueller\nsaid. And more consumers lower the cost of training productions, as well as\nprovide more data for machine learning, he said.\n\nCornerstone \"is in the Netflix business,\" Mueller said.\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on HR learning and development software\n\n  * [\n\n##### Google Cloud adds mainframe migration expertise via acquisition\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/kanaracus_chris.jpg) By: Chris\nKanaracus ](https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/news/252478861/Google-\nCloud-adds-mainframe-migration-expertise-via-acquisition)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Continuous performance management firm, BetterWorks, reboots\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252440581/Continuous-\nperformance-management-firm-BetterWorks-reboots)\n\n  * [\n\n##### See what the best talent management software is for you\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/shacklett_mary.jpg) By: Mary\nShacklett ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/See-what-the-best-\ntalent-management-software-is-for-you)\n\n  * [\n\n##### See which talent management system best suits your business\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/marson_luke.jpg) By: Luke\nMarson ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/See-which-talent-\nmanagement-system-best-suits-your-business)\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [How Leaders in Education Can Modernize IT to Reduce Complexity](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/LiveOptics/How-Leaders-in-Education-Can-Modernize-IT-to-Reduce-Complexity) -DellEMC\n  * [Exploring AI Use Cases Across Education and Government](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/LiveOptics/Exploring-AI-Use-Cases-Across-Education-and-Government) -DellEMC\n  * [Avoid the Hype in AI\u2014Identifying the Right Solutions for Your Business Needs](https://www.computerweekly.com/ITinfrastructure/Avoid-the-Hype-in-AIIdentifying-the-Right-Solutions-for-Your-Business-Needs) -Intel\n  * [See More](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/sponsored_communities)\n\n__Related Content\n\n  * [HR reinvents itself by employing talent management ...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/ehandbook/HR-reinvents-itself-by-employing-talent-management-tools-and-practices) - SearchHRSoftware\n  * [HR to face sea change in online learning software and...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/450411101/HR-to-face-sea-change-in-online-learning-software-and-accent-on-teams) - SearchHRSoftware\n  * [AI in HR: Artificial intelligence to bring out the ...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/AI-in-HR-Artificial-intelligence-to-bring-out-the-best-in-people) - SearchHRSoftware\n\n####  __Join the conversation\n\n###  __ 1 comment\n\nSend me notifications when other members comment.

Essentially, gathering and assessing people analytics\nleads to better decision-making through the application of statistics and\nother data interpretation techniques.\n\nSmarter, more strategic, and data-backed talent decisions are thus closer at\nhand, and this is applicable throughout the employee lifecycle \u2013 from making\nbetter hiring decisions and more effective performance management to better\nretention.\n\nPeople analytics has evolved considerably from when it was first used in\norganizations in the mid-1900s. There has been a clear transition from\nprescriptive analytics to predictive analytics, with which organizations can\nnow be better prepared to face the dynamism of their operational environment\nand be proactive rather than reactive. For example, sophisticated data\nscience, interactive data visualization, and machine learning \u2013 all integral\nparts of people analytics today \u2013 were nowhere a part of the process until a\nfew decades ago.\n\n## **The Process of People Analytics**\n\nPeople analytics today is a lot more intuitive and predictive. With that\nexpectation to live up to, the process involves the following steps.\n\n![The Process of People Analytics](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **Step 1: Dig data that matters**\n\n  \nThe core question to ask here is, \u201cWhat data is relevant to our business\ngoals?\u201d\n\nand to set the key performance indicators (KPIs) accordingly. This allows you\nto save major resources by only investigating areas that need direct\nmonitoring, such as operational tasks within the people management spectrum,\nand can lead to tangible business success.\n\nIf it does not add strategic value, digging that data could be a waste of\ntime. Knowing what to focus on also helps in applying the right statistics,\ndata mining, machine learning, survey management, and strategic workforce\nmanagement tools.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n### **Step 2: Experiment, explore, enrich**\n\n  \nIn a crowded and visibly fragmented market, it is imperative to choose a\npeople analytics tool by exploring the market, experimenting with different\noptions, and analyzing which option would enrich the organization the most.\nMultiple offerings include data mining, data transformation, and data\nvisualization techniques, all merged into a user-friendly self-service\ninterface.\n\nPlatforms that offer a wide range of features often require a lot of manual\nmanipulation to access important data, and these aspects can be tested only\nthrough systematic experimentation.\n\n### **Step 3: Have an action plan ready**\n\n  \nOnce you know what your end goal is, which data is relevant, and what the\navailable options are (based on clear pros vs. cons analysis), create an\naction plan. Applying big data and predictive analytics to **[talent\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/)** , leadership development, and organizational capabilities often\nhelps in fine-tuning the action plan.\n\nMoreover, having a well-defined plan of action enables a better understanding\nof why certain changes may be taking place and where the organization is\nheaded and can thus help garner more stakeholder support.\n\n### **Step 4: Avoid legal loopholes**\n\n  \nEnsuring that legal compliance is maintained in the collection of all data is\ncrucial. Before you start on the analytics project, have a legal team validate\nthe data sourcing techniques and processes. It does not end here.\n\nOnce the raw data has been gathered and treated, the results gleaned need to\nbe approved as well before they can be applied or published. In our digital\necosystem, with data protection and privacy laws still evolving, it is prudent\nto keep abreast of the changes and double-check on legal compliance.\n\n### **Step 5: Create leaner systems**\n\n  \nIrrespective of the complexity of the project at hand, the broader strategy\nthat the processes must adhere to needs to be simple and lean. The basic\nprocess of data analysis and interpretation should allow for easy application,\nupdating, and readability.\n\nFor example, create the basic outline simplified as intake and design (data\ncollection and the design of the analysis), data cleaning (removing irrelevant\nor unreliable data), data analysis (quantitative and qualitative exploration),\nand sharing insights (interpretation and presentation of the data). This can\nhelp avoid unnecessary complications such as confusion about the flow of steps\ninvolved, time wastage, or repetition of sub-processes that occur with\nunstandardized process structures, while still allowing room for tweaks where\nnecessary.\n\nThe idea is to find the right balance between the limited moving parts (people\nand the dynamism of the environment) and fluid, customizable systems and\nprocesses of people analytics. When you have the right team with the relevant\nskillset in place, it is easier to streamline the whole process and apply\nquality controls.\n\n### **Step 6: Build a fact-based, measurable HR business strategy**\n\n  \nA realistic HR business strategy avoids functional silos and can align talent\nto business seamlessly. Having clear KPIs and ROI expectations from people\nanalytics endeavors ensures that the impact is measured often and with\ntransparency. A winning strategy needs to be backed by data and an effective\nplan of action.\n\n### **Step 7: Take tech support**\n\n  \nTechnology is interspersed with every aspect of life today and more so with\nprocesses like people analytics, where often a bulk of analytical data is to\nbe treated with little or no room for error. New-age HR tech tools make real-\ntime data easily accessible. And this is an opportunity that needs to be\nmilked because today, agility and real-time intelligence can truly set you\napart from the competition.\n\n## **Four Key People Analytics Trends**\n\nSince people analytics relies heavily on evolving data-mining technologies and\ndata-interpretation strategies, the trends around people analytics develop in\ntime to the same. Here are the top 4 trends that are shaping people analytics\nin itself and how it interacts with the business. Some trends work in a dual\nloop \u2013 they affect people analytics and in turn, all other aspects of HR.\n\n![Four Key People Analytics Trends](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **1\\. Transforming what HR is and does**\n\n  \nBersin research points out that a meager 2% of HR organizations have mature\npeople analytics competence to bank on. There is thus quite a heavy first-\nmover advantage for innovative, intelligent organizations that are trying to\ntap into this space.\n\nWith people analytics changing how recruitment is conducted, how performance\nis measured, how compensation is planned or growth is mapped, and how learning\nand retention can be managed better, people analytics is quickly changing how\nHR operates.\n\nAccording to recent studies by Deloitte, increasing job offer acceptance\nrates, reducing HR help tickets, and optimizing compensation are just a few\nways in which people analytics is quickly becoming the new currency of HR.\nMoreover, with HR processes evolving to keep pace with business needs, people\nanalytics is moving from being a one-time initiative to becoming a real-time,\neasily modifiable tool that HR has immense benefits to draw from.\n\n### **2\\. Transforming HR business interactions**\n\n  \nWith recent trends in the work ecosystem, the interaction between HR and\nbusiness stakeholders (both internal and external) has been undergoing a\ntransformation as well. People analytics needs to change in keeping with the\nlatest trends in leadership. More transparency is a key trend emerging here,\nand intelligent insight is the need of the hour.\n\nBusinesses today need to be able to make sense of seemingly unrelated data\nstreams and find meaning, correlation, and maybe even interdependence between\none or more factors to predict and manage work better. People analytics has\nthe potential to provide actionable recommendations to enable strategic\nplanning and execution processes.\n\n### **3\\. Transforming the HR-employee relationship**\n\n  \nEmployee expectations today are consumer-grade. People analytics is providing\norganizations with the ramp to upgrade the **[employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience/)**. Every interaction that a candidate or an employee\nhas with an organization is a data point and could be utilized to glean\ninteresting insights. The idea is the need to transform the relationship that\nthe HR has with employees \u2013 to help HR become and be perceived as more than\njust a support function.\n\n### **4\\. Transforming the quality of insights**\n\n  \nThe quality of insights that are expected on a daily basis has changed over\nthe course of the last couple of years. People analytics can live up to these\nexpectations if you focus on two key aspects: analytics literacy and data\nsecurity.\n\nMore employees will need to become analytics literate to decrease dependence\non technical staff and to allow more perspectives to flourish. As people\nanalytics becomes a staple at organizations, data integrity and data security\nwill need to be upgraded and maintained for all listening channels and pulse\nchecks.\n\nWe discussed legal compliance, but data security should ideally go deeper than\nthat and become a cultural trait within the organization rather than being\nsuperficial check just for the sake of being compliant.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Talent Acquisition Specialist: 10 Key Skill Requirements\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-specialist-key-skill-requirements/)**\n\n## **Three Key Level-based Checks to Choose the Right People Analytics Tools**\n\nWith a vast array of available vendors, options, and subscription plans,\nchoosing the right people analytics tools can often seem like a rather\ndaunting task. Here\u2019s a three-level need-based check to make the right\ndecision.\n\n### **Level 1: A working HR dashboard**\n\n  \nTo get started with people analytics, use a basic dashboard that allows you to\ncapture, aggregate, and visualize data.\n\nTools like Power BI, Tableau, and Qlik allow ease of use and ease of data\naccess. With a level 1 requirement, your priority should be to keep your\npeople analytics system as simple as possible.\n\n### **Level 2: An insightful HR dashboard**\n\n  \nYou may have a steady dose of relevant data and need basic insights to analyze\nbetter and make stronger decisions. Statistical tools like Excel or SPSS are\neffective as well, though they may not come with quirky visual aids and\nsocial-media style interfaces. Tools like Visier, while taking some time to be\nset up, come with holistic analytics solutions.\n\n### **Level 3: A predictive HR dashboard**\n\n  \nYour organization is at the third requirement level when you seek not only to\nanalyze data but also to make intuitive predictions based on upcoming trends.\nThese tools help you study behavior in a way that you can predict the next\ncourse of action.\n\nFor example, there might be some correlation between your employees updating\ntheir LinkedIn page, taking frequent leaves, and with them not being very\ncontent at work. While this is a very simplistic situation, predictive tools\ncould help you make connections with behavior and decision patterns that you\nmight have missed otherwise.\n\nPython or RStudio can help with advanced analyses for large quantities of\ndata, though they might require you to hire data scientists specialized in the\nfield.\n\n## **Update, Upgrade, and Upskill for Smarter People Analytics**\n\nWith the latest people analytics and workforce analytics solutions, you can\ndelve deeper into the behavioral aspects of work, understand the cause-effect\nrelationship between different human and non-human aspects at work, and make\nbetter decisions.\n\nThe three points to remember are to know what data you need to quantify and\nqualify, to understand what the latest trends are, and to know what your end\ngoals are. Enabling your HR to update, upgrade, and upskill their knowledge\nand capabilities will ensure that your organization optimizes the latest\npeople analytics offers and can ride the latest trend waves towards a smarter,\nhappier workforce.\n\n_What people analytics trends do you predict for 2020?

Josh Bersin, president and\nfounder of Bersin & Associates (now known as Bersin by Deloitte) coined the\nterm \u201c[learning experience platform](https://www.g2.com/categories/learning-\nexperience-platform-lep)\u201d (also known as LEP and LXP) to encapsulate this\nexpansion. And the industry just keeps expanding\u2014the global [training\neLearning](https://www.g2.com/categories/training-elearning) market, including\n[corporate LMS](https://www.g2.com/categories/corporate-lms) and LEPs, is\nexpected to hit [$200\nbillion](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/e-learning-market-to-\nhit-us-200-billion-by-2024-1005334047) by 2024.\n\n[![See the Highest-Rated Learning Experience Platform \\(LEP\\) Software, Free\n\u2192](https://no-\ncache.hubspot.com/cta/default/4099946/5cf2a4c0-c475-4b19-9349-1f38aebcb8eb.png)](https://cta-\nredirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/4099946/5cf2a4c0-c475-4b19-9349-1f38aebcb8eb)\n\nAccording to G2\u2019s [employee engagement](/2019-employee-engagement) report,\nonly 34% of non-HR employees surveyed feel more engaged than they did the\nprevious year. Meanwhile, according to a recent [Gallup\nreport](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-workplace-\nreport-2017.aspx), 51% of American workers are actively looking for a\ndifferent job or keeping an eye on job openings.\n\nCompanies that develop initiatives to engage their workforce will experience\nan increase in retention, productivity, and morale. And there are many\npossible methods to improve employee engagement; it might come in the form of\nsoftware, career management, or training and education initiatives, to name a\nfew. Investing in a thorough onboarding process and training regimen will not\nonly engage employees from Day 1 but will improve retention by continually\nmoving employees forward on their career paths.\n\nEngaged employees are those with a sense of purpose and belonging. What better\nway to engage employees than by giving them control over their learning and\nallowing them to choose how and when they learn and grow?\n\n[![Are employees as engaged as HR teams believe?

These learning technologies are often referred to as a\n\u201cNetflix for learning.\u201d Rather than administrative-driven courses sent to\nspecific departments or employees, with these programs, employees can choose\nfrom a selection of easily accessible content that\u2019s discoverable and\nshareable by all employees at a company.\n\n* * *\n\n## **Learning experience platforms vs. learning management systems**\n\n\n\n_**Choice \u2014**_ The learner gets to choose how and when to engage with\nmaterials of their choice. As referenced above,  employees have the option to\ninfluence their own learning experiences instead of taking administrative-\ndriven courses.\n\n_**Content \u2014**_ Learning platforms directly impact the amount of available\ncontent. LMS are typically closed systems, meaning only administrators can\nchoose and add content. This can result in a narrow selection of learning\ncontent, as administrators must curate the selection of materials. LEPs, on\nthe other hand, are open systems, which allow users\u2014from learning and\ndevelopment (L&D) directors to employees\u2014to select and build content that\nsuits their personal learning interests.\n\n_**Directed vs. personalized learning \u2014**_ LMS are typically used by L&D\ndirectors and HR departments to ensure employees adhere to internal standards\nas well as pertinent laws and regulations. This training is typically given to\nemployees during the onboarding process and as new processes and regulations\narise. The learning content is often presented in the style of a course and\nmay include text, video, or audio followed by a quiz to be completed by a\nspecific time and day.\n\n[![Find the best Corporate LMS Software on the market.

Meanwhile,\nLEPs are designed to provide employees with options based on the skills\nnecessary to develop in their current roles, and it provides the option of\nlearning new content outside their current position. These systems let users\nchoose content including external, internal or subject matter expertise (SME).\nThis is why LEPs are called Netflix-style systems.\n\nThere are various learning experience platform providers available and each\nhas advantages and disadvantages. Some integrate directly with corporate LMS\nto extend the reach of these training solutions, some provide microlearning\nfeatures, and on and on.\n\n## Benefits of LEPs\n\n  * Empower and engage employees\n  * Promote career development\n  * Address skills gaps\n  * Recognize employee expertise\n\nBusinesses are focusing on training and learning initiatives and empowering\nemployees to direct what, when and where they learn. Many learning experience\nplatforms integrate with LMS to enhance these systems. Depending on the size\nof the company and its training needs, LEPs can be used to engage employees\nwith enticing learning content beyond compliance- and position-related skills\ntraining.\n\n**Check out these[employee training](/employee-training) ideas create an\nengaging employee training experience.**\n\n[ ![Courtney\nMoran](https://learn.g2.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202019-01-28%20at%2012.54.37%20PM.png)\n](https://learn.g2.com/author/courtney-moran)\n\n[ Courtney Moran ](https://learn.g2.com/author/courtney-moran)\n\n[__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/csmoran/)[__](https://twitter.com/G2Courtney)[__](https://learn.g2.com/employee-\nengagement-infographic?rel=author)\n\nCourtney is G2's senior research analyst for HR technologies, whose coverage\nareas include recruiting, employee engagement, and talent management.

And the idea of a\ncommunity at work is always so important especially in a field such as theirs\nwhere entertainment is a creative process and best experienced with a\ncommunity. How did the firm build a culture of collaboration for creative\nideation?\n\nIn an exclusive interaction with us, Shamita Ghosh, Head-Human Resources,\nBookMyShow shares an interesting initiative undertaken by the company to\nelevate employee experience by building a culture ripe for creative ideation.\n\n![bookmyshow](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1585720908/Shamita_Ghosh_uonaai.jpg)\n\n### The Problem Statement\n\nFor a long time, the different teams of the BookMyShow family worked out of\ndifferent physical office spaces until recently (last November) when they all\nmoved into our new, consolidated office building in Mumbai. While they did\nhave enough options to facilitate inter-departmental interaction, and learning\nthrough various team-building initiatives, there was a need for a more\nabsolute and seamless collaboration for creative ideation across departments\nand levels of management. The firm was looking for ways to not only enhance\nthe overall culture of BookMyShow but also instill a sense of community\namongst our employees for a better experience.\n\n### The Implementation of \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019\n\nWith this in mind, the firm conceptualized and put together \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019,\nan initiative that regularly creates and executes employee engagement\ninitiatives. The idea of \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 is to bring back some of this\nentertainment to the employees and have some creative activities planned\nwherein they can take the quotient of having fun at the workplace, higher and\nlet their hair down every once in a while. After long hours at work, it\u2019s very\nnatural that they deserve a treat in the manner that they enjoy most.\n\n### Rolling out \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019\n\nThe firm launched the \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 program in a way that created buzz and\ncuriosity about this new initiative across the workplace. It sent out some\ninteresting notes on various activities that didn\u2019t give away the full\ninformation but kept it intriguing for employees-displaying them in common\nareas such as waiting areas, elevators, cafeteria and washrooms. It then\ncreated a very visually attractive calendar for the month, informing employees\nof the various events and sessions that were lined up for that month.\n\nCulture Canvas spans everything from open mics, stand-up comedy gigs, live\nmusic performances by bands or artists to board games, table tennis, and other\nsporting tournaments, dance workshops, drama sessions, movie screenings,\nmental health and wellness sessions, fitness sessions, masterclass sessions,\ncooking workshops and much more.\n\nEach week would have a planned initiative that would take place during the\nevenings within a specific area of the office, where employees would gather\ntogether and be a part. \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 includes activities twice each week,\ntypically on Wednesdays and Fridays. All employees are sent an email and\nregistration form to join in. Employees can register for their chosen activity\nand they are informed of the event through a calendar invite.\n\nThis initiative intended to let the employees break free and explore various\ncreative outlets while at work as also to unwind in the evening with something\nfun. It was meant to allow them to enjoy their time after a long arduous day\nat work and most importantly, get introduced and engage with new colleagues\neach time. As acquaintance builds, so does engagement across departments. This\neventually leads to a significantly better and collaborative culture.\n\n![bookmyshow](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1585721607/Orange_College_Application_Timeline_Infographic_1_aourof.jpg)\n\n###  Challenges in Execution\n\n\u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 brings in experts and artists from the outside world to\nBookMyShow for several of its activities. So initially getting external talent\nto come in and host sessions, when the initiative was newly launched was a bit\ntough since it hadn\u2019t been done with the kind of frequency that BookMyShow has\nadopted. However, with BookMyShow already being the pioneer in the\nentertainment space, with so much to offer for users, it was a matter of time\nbefore it was able to establish strong and meaningful connections with the\ncreative fraternity for these sessions and drive these activities.\n\n### The ROI from \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 for Employee Experience\n\n\u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 has helped BookMyShow improve employee experience in a\nmassive way. It received a lot of positive feedback from employees on how they\nfeel rejuvenated and creatively energized even at the end of a long day. There\nhas been a lot of curiosity and excitement about each event and the upcoming\nones that employees can be part of. The firm also received a lot of\nsuggestions from them on the kind of activities that they would like to be\nincluded that may be beneficial and enjoyable for them.\n\n> Adds Shamita, \u201c\u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 has not only brought a breath of fresh air\n> into the way employees engage with the organization but also brought people\n> a whole lot closer than earlier. It has infused a great deal of optimism and\n> positivity into the work culture, which we believe is a fantastic\n> achievement, especially since we tend to spend several wakeful hours at\n> work.\u201d\n\n### Future plans based on the outcomes of the Case Study\n\nThe firm continues to drive \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 at the same frequency, even\nduring this lock-down period by enabling virtual fitness sessions with experts\nfor employees and specific upskilling courses through secondary learning that\nrange from soft skills to data science and technology. The firm has also\nstarted hosting a special break session virtually called 'Chai-Time Quickies',\nwhere it creates and curates entertaining contests and video content for\nengaging with employees, becoming their tea-time companions while they are\naway. The idea is to continue to bring to employees of BookMyShow, the\nentertainment they deserve, at work even during these times of a lockdown\namidst the global health crisis.\n\nTaking it further, the firm also recently launched \u2018BookMyShow Communities\u2019,\nwhich are common interest groups of readers, travelers, techies, fitness\nfreaks and karaoke lovers. The groups become spaces where people can read a\ncommon book together and review it, or create a travel blog about their travel\nexperiences, have coding challenges and tech quizzes together, create fitness\nprograms and share workouts, sing and share karaoke songs and much more. The\nmotive of the groups is to enable people with similar interests to make new\nfriends across departments within the company and engage with many more people\nthan they usually do, through discussions and activities.\n\n> Shamita aptly adds, \u201cAs India\u2019s leading entertainment destination,\n> BookMyShow is not just for its customers but equally so for its employees\n> who work hard to provide the best of it for millions of users. We hope to be\n> able to get back to the office safe and soon enough to further build on\n> these initiatives.\u201d\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Employee Engagement](/category/compensation-\nperformance/employee-engagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=employee-\nengagement \"Browse more in: Employee Engagement\"),\n[#CXtoEX](/tag/cxtoex?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=cxtoex \"Browse more\nin: CXtoEX\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Shweta Modgil](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1524982217/authors/shweta-\nmodgil.jpg)](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\n#### [Shweta Modgil](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\nShweta is working as a Senior Features Writer with People Matters.

Now, we are inching closer to a highly\nintegrated environment where performance management feeds into and from all\nother talent decision-making tools active in the organization.

Intelligent performance\nmanagement can help you [close the skills\ngap](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\nemployers-can-close-skills-gap/), reduce external hiring, and drive\nproductivity like never before.\n\nHowever, performance management is a rapidly changing space \u2013 we\u2019ve previously\ndiscussed how it\u2019s one of the [top five _HR_ trends that witnessed a massive\nchange in the last decade.](http://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/2010-vs-2020-hr-trends/)\n\nUnderstandably, it can be difficult to continuously align your strategies and\ntoolkits to keep up with the latest performance management trends. That\u2019s why\nwe turned to leading analysts to bring you five of these trends for 2020.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **3 Steps to Update Your Performance Management\nProcess**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/3-steps-to-update-your-performance-management-process/)\n\n## **5 Trends That Will Performance Management in 2020**\n\n[Performance management](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-\nmanagement-hcm/what-is-performance-management/) is now based on community\nfeedback from an employee\u2019s peers and regular dialogue with the employee to\nobtain an accurate picture of their performance. This is possible through\ncutting-edge performance management tools meant for agile goal-setting and\n[continuous\nfeedback](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/culture/building-a-\nculture-of-feedback-in-conversation-with-didier-elzinga-culture-amp/).\n\nSo, what does the performance management space have in store for HR\nprofessionals this year? Here are five important trends from Gartner, Mercer,\nGallup, BetterWorks, and Harvard Business Review (HBR).\n\n### **1\\. Companies will prioritize the quality and impact of performance\nmanagement processes over efficiency**\n\n  \n_According to Gartner, 67% of organizations aim to reduce the time and effort\nspent on performance management._\n\nIn a [survey of 9,438 people](https://www.gartner.com/en/human-\nresources/trends/why-performance-management-is-failing) (work email needed),\nGartner found that 82% of HR leaders agree about the ineffective nature of\nexisting performance practices. Most leaders focus on reducing time and effort\non performance management, but this largely counterproductive.\n\nGartner found that prioritizing effort reduction can bring down workforce\nperformance by 16.6%!\n\nIn 2020, a key trend will be to prioritize performance management so that it\nis an employee-centric experience. Companies will adopt software that offers\nan engaging experience for both managers and employees, generating feedback\nthat is most relevant to work and adds genuine value to employee performance\nand productivity.\n\n### **2\\. Performance management software will be integrated with other talent\ndecision-making tools**\n\n  \n_According to Mercer, 70% of companies want to strengthen the link between\nperformance management and other talent decisions._\n\nMercer\u2019s 2019 [survey of 1,154 HR leaders](https://www.mercer.com/our-\nthinking/career/performance-transformation-in-the-future-of-work.html) (email\nneeded) highlighted the need to link performance management and talent\ndecisions more closely. Like Gartner\u2019s prediction, the survey questions the\nvalue-generating capabilities of existing processes. In fact, only 2% of\ncompanies feel that their performance management approach is geared for value.\n\nTo address this, performance management software will have to become part of a\ncentralized [talent\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-talent-management/) system, where a single source of employee data\ninforms every talent decision. Feedback, learning & development, career\nprogression, succession planning, and even\n[recruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-recruitment/) could form a part of this new talent\n\u201cecosystem.\u201d\n\n### **3\\. Coaching feedback, as opposed to critical feedback, will be\ninstrumental in 2020**\n\n  \n_According to Gallup\u2019s analytics and the company\u2019s work with Stanford\nUniversity, current approaches to feedback lower performance approximately\none-third of the time._\n\n[Gallup\u2019s internal analytics\nrevealed](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/249332/harm-good-truth-performance-\nreviews.aspx) that only 14% of employees strongly agree that they are inspired\nby typical performance reviews. In contrast, a weekly system where managers\nregularly coach employees is far more effective. In a weekly feedback system,\nemployees are 2.7X more likely to be engaged and 3.2X more likely to be\nmotivated.\n\nThe annual system suffers from two shortcomings. The feedback has probably\nbecome irrelevant by the time the employee receives it. Also, it not\nactionable in the short term, making employees feel frustrated. Gallup\u2019s\nmetrics turn the spotlight on the need for strength-based performance\nmanagement (popularized by [executive\ncoaching](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/executive-coaching-for-middle-managers/)), rather than critical\nfeedback shared once a year. And this brings us to the next performance\nmanagement trend for 2020.\n\n### **4\\. \u201cContinuous\u201d will be the new normal, calling for agile performance\nmanagement systems**\n\n  \n_According to BetterWorks, companies that switched to continuous performance\nmanagement outperform their competitors by 24% \u2013_[agile\nsystems](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/agile-performance-management-software/) _are critical to this\ntransformation._\n\n66% of companies who leverage continuous performance management are able to\nboost productivity all year long, compared to just 35% of those who don\u2019t. In\nfact, [BetterWorks\u2019 survey](https://blog.betterworks.com/betterworks-released-\nthe-first-report-based-on-insights-from-our-2019-2020-state-of-continuous-\nperformance-management-survey-this-report-focused-on-quantifying-the-business-\nimpact-of-a-continuous-per/) of 500 respondents revealed that a continuous\nmodel helps companies perform better in several areas, including enterprise\nagility (47% vs. 27%), workforce engagement (58% vs. 37%), retention (63% vs.\n41%).\n\nThe survey confirms a growing trend in HR: embracing a less formalized and\nmore agile approach to performance management, where you can dynamically set\ngoals, source feedback, and improve productivity. Platforms that can analyze\ndata in real-time and depict changing performance trends accurately will be in\nhigh demand this year.\n\n### **5\\. 2020 will bring new synergies between employee engagement and\nperformance management**\n\n  \n_According to the Harvard Business Review, over 90% of business leaders agree\nthat engaged employees perform better._\n\nHarvard Business Review Analytic Services\n[surveyed](https://www.glintinc.com/resource/peak-performance-how-combining-\nemployee-engagement-and-performance-management-fuels-organizational-success/)\n717 business leaders (email needed) to find out the key drivers of\nperformance. Over 90% said that [employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/) was critical, but only 26% were confident that their\ncompanies had high levels of employee engagement. 2020 is the year to address\nthis, with better integration between HR systems.\n\nGoing back to trend no. 2 (from Mercer), it\u2019s clear that the interoperability\nof performance management tools will be a key priority. Currently, only 16%\nenjoy both high-performance and high engagement, indicating a lot of room for\nimprovement for \u201claggard\u201d companies as per Harvard Business Review.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What is HRIS? System, Model and\nApplication](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)**\n\n## **Make 2020 the Year of Employee-Centric Performance Management Practices**\n\nPerformance management has been an HR staple for a while now, but existing\nmodels require an end-to-end overhaul. The traditional, annual-appraisal\nstructure is far from being employee-centric. Your workforce receives feedback\nlong after the actual activity, and they cannot meaningfully collaborate with\nmanagers to improve performance.\n\nThat\u2019s why companies should take inspiration from Gartner, Mercer, Gallup,\nBetterWorks, and HBR\u2019s insights and consider the following:\n\n  * Link systems to the larger [talent management](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-hcm/what-is-talent-management/) fabric for outcome-focused decisions\n  * Embrace continuous performance management and feedback using agile systems\n  * Ensure employee engagement features like rewards, recognition, and two-way communication are available on your performance management software\n  * Use learning and development (L&D;) to plug performance gaps through the year, without waiting for appraisal season\n\n  \nInterestingly, all of these performance management trends share a common\nelement: they highlight gaps in existing performance strategies and tools.\n\nFortunately, the data is already there, flowing in from multiple disparate\nsources, be it talent management, employee engagement, or L&D; platforms. 2020\nwill be all about consolidating them to formulate an effective performance\nmanagement strategy.\n\n_Which trend do you think will revolutionize performance management in 2020?\nTell us on_[ _Facebook_](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist/) _,_[\n_LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-technologist/) _, or_[\n_Twitter_](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist?lang=en?) _.

A robust performance management system plays an important\nrole in helping companies determine the efficacy of their workforce while\nensuring employees have a clear idea of the important parameters of\nassessment. With such an important role, it's of little wonder that 2019 has\nwitnessed many companies experiment with the right way to undertake\nperformance management and technology has had a central role in play in many\nof such changes.\n\nFor companies, getting performance management right has become imperative.\nWith external market conditions becoming more competitive and technology\ndisrupting much of how business once used to happen, having the right\nperformance management system in place means having a clear idea where and how\nto make employees more productive. It also helps companies address\ninefficiencies in their workforce and develop the people with the right fit\nand skills even further.\n\nWith this intent in mind, it comes as little surprise how the relevancy of\nupdating the performance management system has become an important HR\npriority. A Gartner report notes that a vast majority of HR leaders (84%) are\nworking to fix their performance management systems. Also, to making the\nprocess more impactful, factors like perception of performance management as\nbureaucratic, costly and of the low-value processes make it important for HR\nprofessionals to revamp performance management to make it more robust.\n\nThe year saw a shift of many companies moving away from traditional, often\nannual ways of addressing performance issues and taking up a rather dynamic\napproach. The best companies are shifting away from rigid systems toward a\nmore flexible approach that reinforces the critical behaviors that matter\nevery day and aligned individual work with organizational goals. Effective\nperformance management includes providing meaningful, real-time feedback;\nensuring that employees have clear expectations; and coaching employees to\nachieve their maximum performance levels. The following aspects of performance\nmanagement took center stage this year\n\n### Compensation models\n\nToday these is a need to measure performance more accurately. Employees,\nespecially in companies that operate in highly disruptive industries like tech\nand finance, often work through different projects and cross-functional teams/\nPerformance management as a result too has become more holistic. 360-degree\nreview, for example, is slowly becoming accepted as a form of performance\nreview and helps make the entire process more adaptive.\n\n### Employee experience and development\n\nEmployee experience has become an important factor to influence performance\nmanagement systems. Much like how other aspects of modern-day HR take employee\nexperience into account, performance management systems have begun doing the\nsame. Today employee experience refers to the culture that the employees are a\npart of through their entire interaction with the company. The process has\nbeen made to feel less transactional and cumbersome for employees and helps in\nenabling employees to improve their overall performance. Managers too are\nbeing trained on having performance-based discussions that help address gaps\nand make employees more productive.\n\n### Role of technology\n\nThe growing role of HR tech has enabled performance management to be more\ndata-driven and take into account a larger set of data to remove bias. The\ndigital technologies within performance management have made it more real-time\nand impactful in driving productivity. But with such a rise, there also is the\nneed to build the right ways to leverage tech. With the application of AI and\nautomation increasing, HR professionals will aim to create more robust and\nmeaningful performance reviews, in the coming years.\n\n### Succession planning and training gaps\n\nPerformance management systems have been tuned to create ways of assessing\ncompetency gaps and developing talent. HR professionals can leverage such\nsystems to identify high performing talent and plan leadership succession with\ngreater accuracy. By building systems that are continuous and involve a\n360-degree performance review, HR professionals can contribute more\nstrategically to businesses and channelize efforts to retain key talent.\n\nThe bedrock many such changes in performance management in recent years has\nbeen in the case of improving the effectiveness of such systems in the first\nplace. Usually being a cumbersome process and one that many dreaded, the aim\nof performance management to make an employee more productive has been an\nimportant force of change this year. This shift is important as many companies\nhave begun extending this concept to undertake performance management more\ncontinuously. In an attempt to make change performance management from a\nperiodic, transactional, and often tick in the box activity, HR professionals\nare actively trying to use it to add more value to employee work.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Performance Management](/category/compensation-\nperformance/performance-\nmanagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=performance-management

It simply\nwasn\u2019t designed to do so. With ILT likely one of your largest training\ninvestments, what can you do about it?\n\n## **Understanding Instructor-Led Training Operations**\n\nILT is fundamentally different from e-learning; it involves more complex back-\noffice processes and a wider range of strategic resources. As a result, ILT\ntends to be costlier. One question is crucial in understanding why LMSs fall\nshort in ILT management: What\u2019s most important to you when managing ILT?\n\nA successful ILT program generally hinges on the achievement of three core\ngoals:\n\n1\\. streamlining logistics, scheduling, and administration  \n2\\. managing resources  \n3\\. optimizing the budget.\n\nSo why do LMSs fall short in addressing training logistics, administrative,\nand financial challenges?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## **Different Challenges**\n\nILT and e-learning have different strengths and challenges: ILT\u2019s main\nstrength is its effectiveness (56 percent of organizations find ILT very\neffective versus 21 percent for e-learning, according to Brandon Hall Group),\nand its main weakness is lower cost efficiency. E-learning\u2019s main strength is\nits low cost and flexibility, and its main challenge is delivering engaging,\neffective training. Considering these radically different challenges, it isn\u2019t\nsurprising that the technologies to address them should be different.\n\n## **The E-Learning Mindset**\n\nThe LMS initially is designed to optimize the delivery of online learning,\nwhich is why many of the features listed above, such as test score tracking\nand downloading documents, make sense as extensions of e-learning features. So\neven if an LMS offers some tweaks to manage ILT, its expertise will remain on\nthe delivery rather than the organizational side. Features such as resource\nmanagement and cost tracking, which are the core of ILT management, will come\nas peripheral features, if included at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## **Optimized for Front-Office Interaction, Not Back-Office**\n\nThe unifying theme in LMS features is the focus on front-office interaction\nwith learners\u2014student self-registration, downloading material, and the like.\nThese features are not centered on your administrators\u2019 needs. When managing\nILT, you want to be thinking about collaboration within your training teams.\nVisualizing available instructors and resources? Quickly detecting your SME\u2019s\nskills? Instantly updating training schedules? Accessing session costs in\nreal-time? These are all things LMSs are not built to facilitate.\n\n## **Learner-Centric, Not Session-Centric**\n\nFrom a technical point of view, LMS software uses the learner as a building\nblock, not the session. This is not optimal for ILT, for which the business\nlogic is driven by the training session. An example is cost distribution: An\nLMS consolidates cost per learner to define session costs. However, most ILT\ncosts are fixed regardless of the number of learners: room reservation,\ninstructor fee, and so forth. This is the reason LMSs struggle to provide\naccurate cost tracking. It also means LMSs have a hard time planning future\ninvestments for which learners are not yet identified by name.\n\nHow can you optimize instructor-led training?  \n\n  * Focus on relevant processes that drive ILT efficiency.\n  * Maximize Resources: Have a clear repository of all your resources and keep track of occupancy rates to optimize session financial efficiency.\n  * Rationalize Logistics: Plan steps that must happen before, during, and after each training session; communicate which team should be responsible for each step; and track task completion.\n  * Track Costs: Consolidating accurate data is crucial for budget optimization. This can only be done by tracking investments across different business units, countries, and currencies. \n  * Create a proactive training plan and monitor progress: Use precise forecasts of training volume and costs to plan long-term, and track improvement of key performance indicators (KPIs) year after year.\n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [Learning Management Systems](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Learning%20Management%20Systems)\n  * [Managing the Learning Function](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Managing%20the%20Learning%20Function)\n\n[ ](https://www.td.org/user/about/OlivierServelle)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[Olivier Servelle](https://www.td.org/user/about/OlivierServelle)\n\nOlivier Servelle is sales development director for Training Orchestra.\n\nBe the first to comment\n\nSign In to Post a Comment\n\n[Sign In](https://www.td.org/sign-\nin?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.td.org%2Finsights%2F4-reasons-the-lms-fails-to-\nmanage-instructor-led-training-and-what-to-do-about-it)\n\nSorry!

According to Rita McGrath, one\nof the leading minds in the field of strategy and innovation, the first\nassumption is that industry matters most.\n\nIn B-Schools and elsewhere, we were taught that industries comprise of\nrelatively stable competitive forces. If you take the time and effort to\nanalyze the forces, you will be able to create a roadmap for your business,\nwhich may last for some time. Since industries were considered to be mostly\nstable, one might believe in getting a reasonable return on investment by\nanalyzing industry trends and planning the strategy accordingly. Five-year\nplans were very normal decades ago but today, we find the time span is getting\nmuch shorter, and in many companies, annual updates on strategy is the norm.\n\nThat brings us to the second assumption that is getting derailed. This is the\nholy grail of strategy: sustainable competitive advantage. Having derived a\ncompetitive position within an industry, organizations tended to promote\nemployees who were good at running big businesses, driving operational\nexcellence, improving supply chains and so on, keeping the advantage intact.\nManagement structures that directed resources and talent to strategic business\nunits were associated with high performance. The core assumption here was that\nyou could optimize your systems and processes around a set of sustainable\nadvantages.\n\n> Stability, not change, is the state that is most dangerous in today's hyper-\n> competitive era\n\nHowever, in more and more sectors, and for more businesses, this is not what\nthe world looks like anymore. Examples galore: Music, technology, travel,\nhospitality, movies, communication, consumer electronics, the automobile\nbusiness, healthcare and even education are facing situations in which\nadvantages are copied quickly, technology changes or customers seek other\nalternatives and things move on. In any field today, even when a high\ntechnology product is launched, the advantage will not last for more than 6-9\nmonths.\n\nThe bias that was inherent towards the assumption of stability had been fatal\nto many enterprises and industries from Blackberry, Nokia and Kodak to banking\nand music. Stability, not change, is the state that is most dangerous in\ntoday\u2019s hyper-competitive era.\n\nThe presumption of stability leads to all the wrong reflexes. It encourages\ninertia and power to build up along the lines of an existing business model.\nRemember what happened in the telecom business in India? Existing players knew\nabout the imminent launch of Jio at least two years before and yet none of\nthem thought of a disruptive business model by the new entrant. They assumed\nthat there would be price war and were bracing up for that. What Jio did was\ndisrupting the unit of business from mobile calls to data, which till then was\nunheard of and that ignited the imagination of the consumers while\ndestabilising the business models of incumbents.\n\nStability allows people to fall into routines and habits of mind. It creates\nthe conditions for turf wars and organizational rigidity. It inhibits\ninnovation. It tends to foster the \u2018denial\u2019 reaction rather than proactive\ndesign of a strategic next step. And yet, \u201cchange management\u201d is seen as an\nother-than-normal activity, requiring special attention, training and\nresources. A web search on the very term \u201cchange management\u201d turned up\n21,600,000 results \u2013 that\u2019s twenty-one million citations!\n\nA long track record of relatively stable success caused the ambition to\nhungrily search for new opportunities to atrophy. Once gone, it\u2019s hard to\nregain quickly in the face of fast competitive onslaughts.\n\n### Welcome to the era of transient advantages\n\nCompetition today does not come from within the same industry. Yet,\nenterprises define their most important competitors as other companies within\nthe same industry, meaning those firms offering products that are a close\nsubstitute for one another. In more and more markets, industries are competing\nwith other industries, business models are competing with business models even\nin the same industry, and entirely new categories are emerging out of nowhere.\nLook at the banking industry, for instance. The competitors to a bank are not\njust the other banks but also Apple Pay, Google Wallet, Paytm, Alibaba, and\neven the post offices. Industries are still relevant but using industry as a\nbasis to analyze competitive forces is not relevant anymore. A new level of\nanalysis that reflects the connection between market segment, offerings and\ngeographic location at a granular level is needed. According to Rita, what one\nshould look at is \u201carenas\u201d, that are characterized by particular connections\nbetween customers and solutions, not by the conventional description as\nofferings that are near substitutes for one another.\n\n> Stability allows people to fall into routines and habits of mind. It creates\n> conditions for turf wars and organizational rigidity. It inhibits\n> innovation. It tends to foster the 'denial' reaction rather than the\n> proactive design of a strategic next step\n\nThere is a big difference between thinking about strategy in terms of arenas\nas opposed to industry. In industry analysis, the goal is often to determine\none\u2019s relative position with respect to other players in the same industry.\nIt\u2019s good to have a large market share. And competitive threats are of the\ntraditional kind \u2013 moves around product introductions, pricing, promotions and\nso on.\n\nIn the arena, enterprises need to monitor for changing trends constantly,\ndifferent ways to meet a customer need, how the interplay of technology and\nother industries play on business models, and so on. In essence, management\nmust constantly be asking what jobs of customers they can do next. While the\nsustainable competitive advantage is in jeopardy, there are many opportunities\nthat offer shorter competitive advantages. Spotting these advantages quickly,\nscaling up r rapidly, exploiting that advantage and eventually disengaging\nfrom that business and moving resources to other opportunities are the skills\nfor competing effectively in the transient advantage era.\n\nWith temporary advantages that won\u2019t last long as before, the existing\nbusiness model will always come under pressure, necessitating the need for\nreconfiguration and renewal of the advantage.\n\nThe reconfiguration process is central to winning in transient advantage\nsituations, as it is through reconfiguration that assets, people, and\ncapabilities make the transition from one advantage to another. During\nreconfiguration, teams that might have been engaged to ramp up or exploit an\nadvantage are shifted to some other set of activities; assets are changed or\nredeployed, and people move from one assignment to the next. Rather than\nviewing this change as negative, they are taken for granted as necessary and\nuseful in a transient advantage world.\n\nThe most difficult situation for any enterprise is to disengage from an\nexisting business even when all the telltale signs of its demise are visible.\nThrough a disengagement process, a firm disposes of the assets and other\ncapabilities that are no longer relevant to its future, either by selling\nthem, shutting them down or repurposing them. The objective is to manage this\nprocess gracefully and quickly. Long drawn-out disengagements do little more\nthan consuming resources while not making the end result any more pleasant. In\na transient advantage context, disengaging is not confused with business\nfailure. Indeed, disengagement can and should take place when a business is\nstill viable, rather than when a desperate organization has no other choice as\nwas in the case of Nokia, for instance.\n\nWinning in the transient advantage era that we are in today requires six major\nchanges in strategic thinking.\n\nOrganizations should continually reconfigure their businesses, think about\nhealthy disengagement before it becomes painfully embarrassing, develop the\nability to skillfully reallocate resources, make innovation a way of life\nwithin the organization, develop new leadership mindsets and enable\nindividuals to manage their own career progress for the transient advantage\nera.\n\n> Competition today does not come from within the same industry. Yet,\n> enterprises define their most important competitors as other companies\n> within the same industry, meaning those firms offering products that are a\n> close substitute for one another\n\n### Leadership mindset needs change\n\nWinning in the new era had implications for the mindset leaders bring to their\nbusinesses. They will need to take decisions faster \u2013 not like the telecom\nincumbents \u2013 and in \u2018roughly right\u2019 mode rather than in more precise, but\nslower pace. Prediction and being \u2018right\u2019 will be less important than reacting\nquickly and taking corrective action. And unlike most corporate decision-\nmaking processes today in which people seek out information that suggests they\nare correct; in a world of transient advantage the most valuable information\nis often disconfirming \u2013 it helps highlight where the greatest risks in being\nwrong are.\n\nAll the listed changes above need one major support, and that is solely\ndependent on HR to take a lead on: Timely inputs and knowledge to enable quick\ndecision-making at all levels. The CHRO will have to work closely with the CIO\nin quickly designing a knowledge management and sharing platform that is user-\nfriendly and transparent for disconfirmation bias.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1586143826/Muneer_cjjolk.png)\n\nSome competitive advantages such as deep customer relationships, making highly\ncomplicated machines like airplanes, running a mine with autonomous robots,\nand a great knowledge sharing culture are sustainable for longer periods of\ntime. I propose a solution to enable HR to drive competitive advantage for the\norganization indirectly and help ride the transient advantage waves.\n\n### Creating a knowledge-sharing culture\n\nSharing of knowledge requires a repository of knowledge that is inherent in\nemployees and stakeholders, and facilitating the sharing. Capturing the\ninherent knowledge from scratch is a mega task and without motivating the\naging workforce it will be almost impossible to capture the content. The\nmillennials have less serious issues for sharing.\n\nWhy is knowledge sharing so necessary to compete successfully in the current\nworld? Irrespective of the size of the company, without quick and roughly\nright information flowing freely from bottom-up, leadership will not be able\nto drive the different aspect of the transient advantage economy. The water\ncooler moments have always been about rumors at the top (bad news travel fast\ndownwards) but the bad news from the market doesn\u2019t travel fast upwards.\nChanging that needs a holistic approach.\n\n> It is imperative that a culture of facilitating and sharing knowledge is\n> nurtured and information sharing is enabled across the board\n\nThe proverbial \u201cknowledge is power\u201d and \u201csharing is caring\u201d may not always go\ntogether just as greed and charity. The task for CHRO and team to break this\nstandoff is beyond technology which is why this cannot be a CIO project.\nAccording to a study by Singapore Management University, culture creates a\nbigger roadblock than technology to employees using digital platforms.\nTherefore, it is imperative that a culture of facilitating and sharing\nknowledge is nurtured and information sharing is enabled across the board.\n\nWhile striving to build a knowledge sharing culture, keep in mind the\nfollowing:\n\n  * Encourage transparency in communication\n  * Build a knowledge repository\n  * Decide on the tech platform based on the requirements the organization has and the information sharing needs. \n  * Engage with two-way communications \n  * Imbibe storytelling techniques \n  * Have an open door policy\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Life @ Work](/category/organizational-culture/life-at-\nwork?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=life-at-work \"Browse more in: Life @\nWork\")\n\nDid you

Treading uncharted territory: Tools for today's L&D practitioners\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n### _\u201cToto, I\u2019ve a feeling we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore,\u201d gasped Dorothy in the\niconic movie, The Wizard of Oz. The same is true for HR and L &D experts who,\nfaced with an ever-changing business terrain, are unearthing new ways to\nengage, reskill and upskill employees. Aditi Sharma Kalra reports._\n\nBack in the day, most organisations had a dedicated training executive whose\njob was to pull data from the training needs analysis, input it into an annual\ntraining calendar, book vendors to fill those slots, reserve the conference\nroom, and of course, make sure there was a water bottle and stationery ready\nfor every participant on the day of the event.\n\nFast-forward to today and training executives have given way to comprehensive\nlearning frameworks that pull data from every aspect of the talent life cycle\nto create custom learning paths; they feature a whole menu of training\nprogrammes to choose from; and are likely held outside the confines of the\nconference room (typically during the commute or simply on-the-job).\n\nOh, and T&D is now called L&D \u2013 the former having typically represented the\ninstilling of specific and specialised skills, while the latter takes on a\nmore well-rounded persona of all types of learning experiences.\n\nIn this feature, let\u2019s take stock of the top trends in learning and\ndevelopment through the eyes of interviews from DBS Bank, Essence, MoEngage,\nMcCann Worldgroup Singapore, Societe Generale, and Vinda Group.\n\n### Trend 1: Learning is social\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a noticeable trend that 'going to HR and enrolling in a training or\nconference' could soon be something of the past. We learn from our social\nnetworks more than our books or classroom today,\u201d says Malaysia-based Clayton\nJ.C Tan, HR Director, Southeast Asia, at hygiene company, Vinda Group.\n\nHence, for HR and learning professionals, the role is to build a conducive\necosystem to promote self-motivated social learning for employees.\n\nThe answer, thus, lies in simple, searchable, just-in-time and bite-sized\ncontent for employees to learn while developing solutions on the job.\n\nIn line with this philosophy, banking giant DBS is out to become a learning\norganisation, that is, one which \u201cstands the test of time and makes a\nsustainable impact in the lives of our customers, employees and communities we\nlive in\u201d, as Ying Yuan Ng, Chief Learning Officer at DBS Bank, puts it.\n\nThis journey began in 2009, with a strong foundation comprising intellectual\nassets (learning road maps); physical assets (DBS Academy \u2013 learning campus);\nand technological assets (DBS Learning Hub, an AI-powered online learning\nplatform). In 2018, it started to focus on driving social and community\nlearning in a sustainable way.\n\nIn February this year, the #Learn.Share.Teach campaign was launched to create\na social learning movement. It started out by enlisting employees who were\nsubject matter experts from across the organisation and at all levels.\n\nThey created bite-sized videos using their smartphones on technical topics\nsuch as machine learning to practical tips on presentation skills and fun\nfacts such as best angles for selfies. These were uploaded onto the intranet\nand employees were encouraged to \u201clike\u201d and comment on these videos, knowing\nthat recognition motivates people to go above and beyond and reinforces\npositive behaviours.\n\n\u201cWe also created two special badges (dare to share/teach back) and e-cards on\nour peer-to-peer online recognition platform where people can recognise\ncolleagues who share and teach others,\u201d Ng says.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/08100906/Aditi-Aug-2019-mukta-ramani-yingyuan-\nprovided.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Trend 2: Learning is on-demand\n\nAs a data and measurement-driven agency, it is imperative Essence supports its\npeople in learning the science of distilling the salient points from vast\namounts of data, and the art of storytelling to bring insights powerfully to\nlife for clients.\n\nThus, at the start of this year, Essence stepped away from a white-labelled\noff-the-shelf learning management system and launched a custom-built platform\ntailored to its needs.\n\nIn tandem, it stepped up its e-learning game by investing in powerful, best-\nin-class authoring software for its in-house materials, and also offering the\nfull range of Lynda.com courses to the entire workforce.\n\nSo, while in-person workshops will continue to be a key delivery mechanism,\nthe team has recognised the need for greater availability and accessibility to\nlearning interventions, as close as possible to the point of use of the skills\nor knowledge taught.\n\n\u201cWith that in mind, we\u2019ve invested time and resources into building our\ndigitally accessed training curricula. That means our people can get the\ntraining they need when they need it, even if that\u2019s on the way to work in the\nmorning,\u201d says Veli Aghdiran, Global Vice President, Professional Development,\nEssence.\n\nReiterating the impact of on-demand learning is California-headquartered\ncustomer engagement platform MoEngage. As a product-centric company that is\ngrowing in size, from a business perspective, the goal is to develop and\nretain the right talent to manage the transformation from a small team to a\nlarge organisation.\n\nThus, the approach involves anticipating future skills benchmarks and\nproactively planning programmes to ensure the team can take on current and\nfuture challenges.\n\nJitender Panihar, Chief People Officer at MoEngage, explains the importance of\nthe leadership pipeline: \u201cMany great ideas die because they are not presented\nwell and nobody owns up to execute them. To take an idea to the next level,\nyou have to sell it to your team first, empower your team to overcome the\ndifficulties and see through its execution.\u201d\n\nTo this end, the team at MoEngage designs learner-centric, bite-size\nprogrammes that allow teams to learn quickly and be actively engaged during\nthe process. While the full-day workshops are conducted at the office, the\nsessions are recorded as well as broadcast live for remote teams.\n\nOn the horizon, MoEngage is in the process of setting up mechanisms and mobile\napps to make it easy for its employees to access training materials. \u201cWe are\nbuilding more training programmes that can be taken up on-demand so that\nemployees can take up these programmes whenever they find the time and learn\nat their own pace.\u201d\n\n> ##### Our leaders are crucial to championing change and development, so we\n> invest in programmes like My Lead and TASL (The Art and Science of\n> Leadership) to prepare them for the agile, ever-evolving, integrated and\n> digital environment.\n\n##### - Ramani Amar, Talent Director at McCann Worldgroup Singapore.\n\n### Trend 3: Learning is personalised\n\nAt marketing services group, McCann, employees are constantly reskilling and\nupskilling \u2013 so much so that it starts from the top.\n\n\u201cOur leaders are crucial to championing change and development, so we invest\nin programmes like My Lead and TASL (The Art and Science of Leadership) to\nprepare them for the agile, ever-evolving, integrated and digital\nenvironment,\u201d shares Ramani Amar, Talent Director at McCann Worldgroup\nSingapore.\n\nL&D at McCann is at the core of the overall talent management strategy, with\nthe objective of equipping employees with the knowledge and skills they need\nto excel in their roles to make a real and measurable impact on business\nperformance. This is achieved by creating personalised digital learning paths\nfor employees and it is an ongoing process of continuous coaching and\nmentoring support. \u201cIn the APAC region alone, we have seen a significant\nincrease of 200% in employee training hours,\u201d she reveals.\n\nSo, not only is personalisation imperative, but so is digitalisation.\n\n\u201cThe most successful fast-growing companies are differentiated by one thing:\ndigital enablement. Being flexible, on-demand, engaging and scalable, this new\ntype of training has transformed the way individuals and organisations learn.\u201d\n\nPutting its money where its mouth is, McCann\u2019s in-house digital programme has\nbeen honoured with two gold Brandon Hall Group Excellence awards in 2017. In\naddition, the team has clocked 3319 hours of Facebook Blueprint training.\n\n### Trend 4: Learning is business-driven\n\nIn line with the launch of its 2020 strategic plan, financial services group\nSociete Generale is focused on generating profitable and sustainable growth,\nbased on a diversified and integrated banking model.  \n\u201cWith the aim to grow, transform, deliver on costs, refocus and foster\nresponsibility, learning and development plays a very important role as the\nnew environment means enhancing knowledge, reskilling the workforce and\nshifting mindsets,\u201d says Mukta Arya, Head of Human Resources for Southeast\nAsia at Societe Generale Asia Pacific.\n\nAs such, the group\u2019s training policy has three main aims: establish a culture\nof responsibility through the deployment of a culture and conduct programme;\nintroduce new and more digital ways of learning; and give employees a more\nproactive role in their development and employability by offering a broad\nrange of training programmes and guidance, as a supplement to existing HR and\nmanagerial support.\n\nWhat helps keep this focus laser-sharp is the fact that learning and\ndevelopment sits at the centre of Societe Generale\u2019s talent management chain.\nL&D needs originate from the performance management process, with managers and\nemployees mutually agreeing on them. These then feed into the strategic talent\nidentification process, promotion process and succession planning.\n\n\u201cWe are fully aware of the challenges of employment and of global digitisation\n(new skills, new business lines, new working methods, and so on) so this needs\nanalysis helps us to be focused and invest in relevant topics for our\nworkforce,\u201d Arya explains. \u201cWe are committed to making this investment for all\nemployees across the group, and for specific needs and to develop potential\nleaders, we do invest more.\u201d\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/08101052/Aditi-Aug-2019-clayton-veli-jitender-\nprovided.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Trend 5: Learning is gamified\n\nHeading back to Vinda Group\u2019s Tan, who is passionate about social learning, he\nsays it should be driven by providing employees simple, searchable, just-in-\ntime and bite-sized content.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the organisation can then build in gamified incentives to\nmotivate learners to pick up new skills, share what they have learnt or even\ncontribute to the growing knowledge-base,\u201d he says, pointing to another key\ntrend.\n\nVinda Group is experimenting with such incentive schemes to encourage\nproduction operators to learn new skills themselves in little modules, as well\nas offer themselves as coaches to those who are keen to learn.\n\nTan also foresees a further blurring of the line between L&D and talent\nmanagement, with such regularity of just-in-time on-the-job social learning\nsurpassing the need for classroom training. \u201cThis is coming true with the\ndesign and execution of a gamified employee career pathing plan,\u201d he says.\n\nIn his view, the idea behind this is to have an employee visualise their\ncareer in the organisation mimicking that of a role-playing game character.\n\nThe employee should be able to clearly understand the competencies involved in\ntheir chosen career paths (or alternative paths); the gaps they are required\nto close to reach the next level; and where they can gain the competencies or\nexperiences needed to close these gaps.\n\nAmong all of these varied trends we unearthed, what was common to all\ninterviewees was their belief in softer skills becoming an imperative for all\nus to stay relevant and thrive in the future.\n\nDBS Bank\u2019s Ng summed up the three must-have soft skills aptly: The first is\nthe ability to \u2018anticipate\u2019. When things are happening so quickly, we have to\nthink ahead and be prepared for multiple possibilities.\n\n\u201cSecond, the willingness to \u2018self-educate\u2019 and take ownership for learning.\nLearning truly happens when we want to learn rather than when we are forced to\nlearn. Third, the capacity to \u2018adapt\u2019. In times of certainty as well as\nambiguity, we have to embrace the situation as it comes and be able to adjust\nquickly to be effective.\u201d\n\n_Lead photo / Clockwise: Interviewees Veli Aghdiran, Mukta Arya, Clayton J.C\nTan, Ying Yuan Ng, Jitender Panihar, Ramani Amar_\n\n* * *\n\nThis feature appeared in the June-July (Singapore) and Q2 (Malaysia) edition\nof _Human Resources_ magazine.

As professionals, we hear it everywhere. The skills gap is growing,\ntechnological advancements are displacing workers, AI continues to change the\nway teams operate. . . . And all the while, expectations for learning leaders\ncontinue to grow.\n\nBut here\u2019s the good news: A whole marketplace of solutions has developed in\nthe past decade to help reskill your workforce, gather data on your people,\nand help inform business and HR decisions. From learning technology ecosystems\nto LMSs and LXPs, this post is intended to help you cut through the noise (and\nacronyms) of the marketplace and help you identify the solution that fits your\nneeds best. Here are the quick and dirty answers to your most frequently asked\nquestions about learning technology.  \n\n## **1\\. What\u2019s an LMS?**\n\nA learning management system (LMS) allows companies to create, deliver, and\ngather data on training courses and learning programs. An LMS is designed to\ndeliver formal learning courses and internal training such as onboarding and\ncompliance courses.\n\nCompanies typically have administrative teams managing the LMS and selecting\nthe content to make available to their employees. As an administrator-driven\nplatform, they\u2019re best suited for implementing top-down learning initiatives\nand aren\u2019t flexible, meaning they won\u2019t recognize any resources users access\noutside of the system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## **2\\. What\u2019s an LXP?**\n\nA learning experience platform (LXP) provides a single point of access for\nformal and information learning. Formal learning resources, like online\ncourses and internal training created on an LMS, are tracked and measured from\nthe same platform as informal learning resources, like articles, videos,\npodcasts, and e-books. Rather than administrators managing employee learning\nfrom the top down, LXPs enable employees to manage their own learning, pulling\nfrom the resources they use in their everyday flow of work.\n\nWhile LXPs are known for having an intuitive user interface, the most\nimportant characteristic of an LXP is the ability to connect the dots between\nall of the points of learning in a modern work environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n## **3\\. What features should an LXP have?**\n\nIn reality, capabilities are more important than features. Features constantly\nchange and evolve with the technology, while capabilities serve as your\nsolutions. Therefore, you should identify the capabilities you want from an\nLXP based on your learning and skilling strategy. Here are some common\ncapabilities learning leaders look for in an LXP:  \n\n  * guidance or insight into what skills employees should be developing\n  * a process to provide feedback on users\u2019 progress, offering both guidance for employees and visibility for the organization\n  * motivation in the form of clear career paths and relevant development opportunities for employees\n  * ability to use behavioral science to recommend and connect users with relevant resources, experts, and experiences\n  * a process to measure the skills of your current workforce\n  * diversity of learning experiences and content (user-generated content, social learning, articles, videos, classes, and more). This includes the ability to create, syndicate, and consume content.\n\nToday, people expect utility, relevance, and personalization, and you create\nthat through a comprehensive learning ecosystem. There is no one-size-fits-all\nsolution, but platforms like Degreed help integrate and enable the needs of\nyour organization and its individual workers, allowing organizations to meet\nthe demands of a changing workforce.  \n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [Emerging Tech](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Emerging%20Tech)\n  * [Learning Management Systems](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Learning%20Management%20Systems)\n  * [Learning Technologies](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Learning%20Technologies)\n  * [Tools & Platforms](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=Tools%20%26%20Platforms)\n  * [xAPI](https://www.td.org/search/?tag=xAPI)\n\n[ ](https://www.td.org/user/about/IsabellaLazzareschi)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[Isabella Lazzareschi](https://www.td.org/user/about/IsabellaLazzareschi)\n\nIsabella Lazzareschi is the content and managing editor at Degreed.\n\nBe the first to comment\n\nSign In to Post a Comment\n\n[Sign In](https://www.td.org/sign-\nin?returnTo=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.td.org%2Finsights%2Fyour-learning-technology-\nfaqs-answered)\n\nSorry!

reviews are a stressful event for both managers and employees.\nThey can range from awkward conversations to pointless feedback to ugly [HR\nnightmares](https://www.hrmorning.com/9-ways-not-to-conduct-a-performance-\nreview/).\n\nAnd a bad review system doesn't just hurt employee performance. It can have\nserious consequences for morale and turnover too.\n\nStudies show that after a [performance\nreview](https://www.hrmorning.com/performance-review) one in five employees\nreport being so upset they cried, while one in three immediately start looking\nfor a new job.\n\nIn this tight labor market, employees have options. If they're not getting\nadequate feedback and the right development, they'll leave.\n\nSuccessful companies take performance management seriously. But even they can\nmake mistakes.\n\nThat's why so many businesses are now relying on a talent management system to\nhelp them get the most from performance reviews.\n\n## What is a talent management system?\n\nA [talent management system](https://www.betterbuys.com/talent-management/) is\nsoftware that streamlines end-to-end employee development from recruiting to\nexit interviews. Although it includes [applicant\ntracking](https://www.hrmorning.com/ats-analytical-insights-recruiting-\nsoftware/), [learning management](https://www.hrmorning.com/employee-training-\nprogram-lms/) and [succession planning](https://www.hrmorning.com/succession-\nplanning-talent-management/) capabilities, the most popular feature is\nperformance management, which helps companies give transparent, continuous\nfeedback.\n\nSome companies only use a talent management system for their top employees,\nwhile others use it for everyone at the organization. In either case, it can\nrevolutionize the way businesses handle performance management and jump-start\nproductivity.\n\nPutting together a great review process, however, is no easy task. Here are\nfive common performance review mistakes and how a talent management system can\nhelp eliminate them.\n\n## 1\\. Not enough feedback\n\nToo many companies still conduct performance reviews once a year. But this\noutdated system can lead to a lot of issues.\n\nOne example is the recency effect. If managers give feedback in December, they\nmight focus on what happened in the past few months, rather than throughout\nthe entire year. Problems or accomplishments from January or February might be\nglossed over or simply forgotten.\n\nAlthough it may not be a conscious act on the manager's part, this type of\nfeedback can feel like a lack of recognition or opportunity to improve for\nemployees. They want to understand how they're doing, and they want to\nunderstand it more often.\n\nIn fact, 65% of [employees want more\nfeedback](https://www.forbes.com/sites/victorlipman/2016/08/08/65-of-\nemployees-want-more-feedback-so-why-dont-they-get-it/) than they're currently\nreceiving.\n\nA talent management system lets companies offer continuous feedback, which\nmeans consistent, meaningful discussions between managers and employees about\nperformance.\n\nWhile annual reviews put pressure on both the manager and employee, because\nthey're infrequent and need to cover a lot of ground, continuous feedback\nmeans [check-in conversations](https://www.hrmorning.com/state-of-the-\nperformance-review-2017-what-the-best-companies-are-doing-today/) are much\nshorter, more focused and less stressful for everyone involved.\n\nManagers may have excuses that their open door policy is enough or that\nkeeping track of multiple conversations is too difficult. And it's true that\ncontinuous feedback can be confusing, especially if you're using a mix of\nemails, chat apps and in-person conversations.\n\nThat's why talent management systems have communication and collaboration\ntools for managers to organize and provide real-time feedback.\n\nSoftware can remind managers when reviews are due and keep a history of all\nnotes and action points from previous discussions. It also gives HR visibility\ninto who's getting feedback from whom and how those conversations are going.\n\nAlthough it can take time to train managers and employees to feel comfortable\ngiving and receiving continuous feedback, any system that offers more regular,\nspecific feedback is a good thing.\n\n## 2\\. Setting the wrong goals\n\nDuring a review, managers discuss how employees are performing against some\ntype of established goals.\n\nBut what if g[oals are ill-defined, overly broad, irrelevant or too\nstatic](http://articles/linking-performance-management-to-strategy)? Employees\ncan feel like they're being measured against the wrong yardstick.\n\nFor companies to have effective performance reviews, employees need to set the\nright goals, which should be:\n\n    * Related to their competencies and skills\n    * Broken down into actionable steps with defined benchmarks\n    * Aligned with the company mission, and\n    * Adjustable based on changes in performance or business demands.\n\nWith a talent management system, employees can record their competencies and\nskills and work with managers to set goals that are relevant to their specific\nbackground.\n\nThe software can also help organize goals into easy-to-manage steps, so that\nemployees have a clear path to success. These steps might include learning new\nskills, essential tasks for a project or coordinating with someone outside the\ndepartment. As employees complete these steps, they can check off their\nprogress on benchmarks and get more guidance or recognition for their\naccomplishments.\n\nManagers and employees can also use the talent management system to compare\ngoals to company objectives. Helping employees understand how their work\nsupports long-term business goals will give them a sense of purpose and\nincrease their productivity.\n\nIf employees are under- or over-performing or if business needs have changed,\nthe manager can work with them to adjust or update their goals at any time.\nThe opportunity to pivot goals can not only help employees succeed, but can\nalso make the business more agile and competitive.\n\n## 3\\. Lack of objectivity\n\nPerformance reviews are only as good as the manager who gives them. If the\nreviewer isn't prepared or objective, employees can feel unfairly judged.\n\nTo be effective, performance should be well-documented. Managers can't rely\nsolely on their memory when giving feedback.\n\nTalent management systems offer a transparent way to set employee goals and\nbenchmarks, track performance and record previous reviews. Managers can use\nintuitive dashboards and analytics to show key performance indicators and\nprogress over time. The software also has compliance protocols for\ndocumentation, reporting and auditing. Features include version tracking and\nevidence collection, which means that performance reviews can't be altered\nwithout people noticing.\n\nStudies have shown that [performance reviews are full of\nbiases](https://www.hrmorning.com/study-performance-reviews-promotion-\ndecisions-can-be-unintentionally-sexist/), and even if those biases aren't\nconscious, they can cause all sorts of problems. In the worst cases, poorly\nconducted evaluations can turn into HR nightmares.\n\nA talent management system can analyze whether managers have certain patterns\nin their feedback. Is the manager rating one demographic lower than others, or\nrating all of their employees higher than other managers? This type of data\ncan be used to avoid claims of bias or discrimination.\n\n## 4\\. Only one reviewer\n\nPerformance reviews also run into trouble when they come from only one source.\n\nIn the past, companies often had siloed departments where employees worked for\nand reported to a single manager. So it made sense for the manager to be the\nonly one reviewing and giving feedback to an employee.\n\nThe modern workplace, however, now uses networks of employee teams to complete\na variety of projects. There's less hierarchy and more time spent interacting\nwith coworkers and managers in other departments.\n\nConsequently, direct managers may not have much daily interaction with that\nemployee and shouldn't be the only reviewer.\n\nFeedback from multiple stakeholders \u2013 peers, subordinates and other managers \u2013\nis becoming more commonplace. Because peers work side-by-side and build closer\nrelationships, they can call out behavior that they see each day. And their\ncomments are generally more positive and supportive, which can motivate\nemployees and act as a form of social recognition.\n\nA talent management system can capture feedback from multiple stakeholders\nthrough online forms or a mobile app and automatically add it to the\nemployee's profile. Companies can then decide how much weight to give\ndifferent groups or specific reviewers, especially if there are outliers.\n\nBut overall, companies will have more sources of reference when it comes to\nemployee performance, which means a more objective, thorough review process.\n\n## 5\\. No coaching and training\n\nEmployees feel frustrated when they're expected to perform at a certain level\nbut not given the tools to reach it. Performance reviews where employees are\ntold that they're under-performing or not making progress may actually be an\nindication that the company lacks proper coaching and training.\n\nEmployee improvement needs to be supported with proper guidance and the\nability to learn new skills. In fact, 87% of millennials, the largest\ngeneration currently in the workforce, say that [professional development\nopportunities are\nimperative](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236438/millennials-jobs-\ndevelopment-opportunities.aspx) to their career.\n\nManagers can use a talent management system to identify employee skill gaps\nand recommend specific training that's needed. And the platform often includes\n[learning management software](https://www.betterbuys.com/lms/) that companies\ncan use to deliver training.\n\nAdditionally, goal-setting may include actionable steps, but managers need to\ncoach employees to help them actually get there. And the benefits of coaching\naren't just for employees. According to [HR expert Josh\nBersin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20131102214028-131079-are-performance-\nappraisals-doomed), \"Companies which provide high levels of development\nplanning and coaching to their employees have a third less voluntary turnover\nand generate twice the revenue per employee of their peers.\"\n\nTalent management systems empower managers with automated coaching tools,\nlinks to on-demand coaching info and workflows to track coaching activities.\nSome software gives managers coaching recommendations based on direct feedback\nfrom engagement surveys. Others can identify which manager will be the best\ncoach for an employee and monitors the coaching process based on self-\nassessments and work experience.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nPerformance reviews are a messy process, and it's easy to make mistakes if\nyou're managing it on your own. That's why leading companies are using\ntechnology to help. With a talent management system, companies can:\n\n    * Offer continuous feedback\n    * Set proper goals for employees\n    * Provide objective reviews\n    * Receive feedback from multiple stakeholders, and\n    * Deliver better coaching and training between reviews.\n\nIf you're in the market for a solution, check out these [reviews of the best\ntalent management systems](https://www.betterbuys.com/talent-management/).\n\n[![Coronavirus & Influenza: Obligations Under FMLA, ADA, Title VII &\nMore:](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Coronavirus\n& Influenza: Obligations Under FMLA, ADA, Title VII &\nMore:](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/HRM-coronavirus-\nwebinar-1.png)](https://www.learningpremier.com/product/coronavirus-influenza-\nobligations-under-fmla-ada-title-vii-\nmore/?utm_source=hrmorning&utm_medium=display&utm_content=8170&utm_campaign=coronavirus-03-31-2020)\n\n#### Keep Up To Date with the Latest HR News\n\nWith HRMorning arriving in your inbox, you will never miss critical stories on\nlabor laws, benefits, retention and onboarding strategies.\n\nSign up for a free HRMorning membership and get our newsletter!\n\n    * Email*\n\n    * username*\n\n    * formOffer\n\n    * businessUnit\n\n    * businessUnitId\n\n    * brand\n\n    * brandId\n\n    * event*\n\n    * controlCode\n\n    * Email\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.\n\n[ ![HR Morning\nLogo](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![HR\nMorning Logo](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/themes/genesis/assets/images/logo-white@2x.png) ]()\n\n    * [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/HRMorning)\n    * [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/HRMorning)\n    * [Linked In ](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4898679/)\n\n    * [ABOUT HRMORNING](https://www.hrmorning.com/about/)\n    * [ADVERTISE WITH US](https://www.hrmorning.com/advertise-with-us/)\n    * [WRITE FOR US](https://www.hrmorning.com/write-for-hr-morning/)\n    * [CONTACT](https://www.hrmorning.com/contact/)\n\n    * [Employment Law](/pbp-categories/employment-law/)\n    * [Benefits](/pbp-categories/benefits/)\n    * [Recruiting](/pbp-categories/recruiting/)\n    * [Talent Management](/pbp-categories/talent-management/)\n    * [HR Technology](/pbp-categories/hr-technology/)\n    * [Performance Management](/pbp-categories/performance-management/)\n    * [Leadership & Strategy](/pbp-categories/leadership-strategy/)\n    * [Compensation & Payroll](/pbp-categories/compensation-payroll)\n    * [Policy & Culture](/pbp-categories/policy-culture/)\n    * [Staff Administration](/pbp-categories/staff-administration/)\n    * [Wellness & Safety](/pbp-categories/wellness-safety/)\n    * [Staff Departure](/pbp-categories/staff-departure/)\n    * [Employee Services](/pbp-categories/employee-services/)\n    * [Work Location](/pbp-categories/work-location/)\n    * [HR Career & Self-Care](/pbp-categories/hr-career/)\n\nHRMorning, part of the Catalyst Media Network, provides the latest HR and\nemployment law news for HR professionals in the trenches of small-to-medium-\nsized businesses.
