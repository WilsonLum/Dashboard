Check it out:\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/payroll-fintech-paylocity-\nacquires-video-communication-platform-vidgrid/) __\n\n[Paylocity](https://www.paylocity.com/), which provides HR and payroll\nservices, has acquired [VidGrid](https://www.vidgrid.com/), which works with\npeer-to-peer video services, according to a [press\nrelease](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paylocity-announces-acquisition-\nvidgrid-130000229.html).\n\nPaylocity said the partnership will help enable more connectivity for workers,\nparticularly amid the rise in working from home and other remote opportunities\n\u2014 factors more important now than ever with the\n[coronavirus](https://www.pymnts.com/tag/coronavirus/) pandemic mandating\npeople stay out of public gatherings.\n\nVidGrid will help Paylocity in the fields of employee collaboration, allowing\nfor more flexibility in how co-workers talk to one another in the modern day,\nwhich the company said it hopes will lead to greater retention of employees\nand more engagement with the businesses using VidGrid as a whole.\n\nPaylocity has already used VidGrid for years to put out a Learning Management\nSystem (LMS) program allowing employers to use videos from outside parties to\ndistribute expert knowledge in various subjects to employees. With growing\nneed from clients, Paylocity saw an opportunity to \"expand the relationship\"\nby acquiring VidGrid, the press release stated.\n\nUsing videos will become more and more important for businesses as the\ndefinition of work expands, including more remote positions and other such\nchanges to the traditional office sphere. Thus, VidGrid was a choice to help\nPaylocity better respond to its customers, the press release stated.\n\nPaylocity CEO Steve Beauchamp said the implementation of videos would be\ncrucial as the world evolves. He said VidGrid shared Paylocity's dedication to\ndoing good work for clients.\n\nNick Stokman, co-founder and CEO of VidGrid, said he wants to help foster\nbetter communication everywhere and looks forward to the future of the two\ncompanies now intertwined.\n\nPaylocity has been doing its best to keep up with the times in terms of\npayments and has recently rolled out an [on-demand\npayment](https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2020/paylocity-gig-economy-\npayroll-wage/) service which the company said will help people get paid\nfaster, without the sometimes cumbersome and slow once- or twice-a-month pay\ncycles that used to be the norm.\n\nBeauchamp said many young people are used to gig economy jobs that paid\nfaster, and, upon being told they'd only be paid a few times a month, found\nthat incompatible with their lifestyles.\n\n[--------------------\n\n**LATEST PYMNTS REPORT: B2B API TRACKER **\n\nSocial distancing has changed eCommerce from a \u2018want to have\u2019 to a \u2018must have\u2019\nfor businesses, yet retailers could struggle to create convenient payment and\nrefund experiences for their apps and websites, says Abdul Raof Latiff, head\nof DBS Bank's digital institutional banking group.

tools to help your team work from home\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/). Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\n[\u95b1\u8b80\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u672c](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/?p=134410&preview=true)\n\nWorking remotely, presents new challenges for staying connected and in touch\nwith colleagues and customers.\n\nMaking sure your team is in regular contact during work-from-home arrangements\nis a vital part of boosting morale and maintaining a strong culture. There\u2019s\nan abundance of task-management, communication and file-sharing apps that you\ncan easily access to keep work flowing smoothly and the team in good spirits.\n\nHere are four tech tools to help you get the job done.\n\n**#1 Task-management apps**\n\nOnline communication tools such as [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-hk/) and\n[Trello](https://trello.com/) assists your team with an overview of tasks that\nneed to attention. You can see how individual projects are progressing, what\ntasks individual team members are focused on. They also allow you to follow\nconversations easily. Tools like this also help connect employees and remind\nthem of your shared work vision.\n\n**Also read:**[ **Work from home could hasten demise of email, says Slack\nCEO**](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/work-from-home-could-hasten-\ndemise-of-email-says-slack-ceo/)\n\nSlack is also an ideal tool for building community, cohesion and cooperation\nwithin your team. It allows you to set up dedicated channels on the platform.\nEven if they are not all strictly work topics, this can help employees feel as\nif they\u2019re having the sorts of conversations they often have at work.\n\n**#2 Video conferencing**\n\nWhen your team won\u2019t be seeing each other in the flesh, video calling\ntechnology helps everyone stay connected. Video conferencing technology like\n[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) is ideal for this \u2013 enabling virtual face-to-face\nmeetings \u2013 that can also be recorded and shared later.\n\nAlthough if you\u2019re concerned about the security issues Zoom has been\nexperiencing recently, [ClickMeeting](https://clickmeeting.com/) is another\nviable option.\n\n**#3 File sharing**\n\nOnline tools like Google Docs allows multiple users to create, share and edit\ndocuments in real time. Any changes to documents are synced and saved in the\nCloud, so you\u2019ll never be second guessing yourself on where you saved the\nlatest version\n\n**#4 Screen recording**\n\nOn occasion, it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll need to show a colleague what you\u2019re talking\nabout or step them through a problem. You can use a screen recording tool such\nas [Loom](https://www.loom.com/), or [Google\nHangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/), to capture your screen, voice and\nface as you explain something. It\u2019s particularly handy when a workmate isn\u2019t\navailable at the same time as you \u2013 such as if you\u2019re in different time zones.\n\nWhile it may initially feel a little overwhelming to work and communicate with\nyour team remotely, there are many tools and resources available that make it\nfeasible and easy to maintain good communication and teamwork.\n\n_Parts of this article first appeared on the_[\n_Seek_](https://www.seek.com.au/) _website._ ****\n\nHuman Resources magazine and the HR Bulletin daily email newsletter:  \nAsia's only regional HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\nBack to Top\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/06113612/Jerene-Apr-2020-roadblock-Malaysia-\ncovid-19-123RF-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Previous Article:\n\n[COVID-19 recognised as an occupational disease under Malaysian\nlaw](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/covid-19-recognised-as-an-\noccupational-disease-under-malaysian-law/)\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/07102911/Jerene-Oct-2019-robot-\ntyping-123RF-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Next Article:\n\n[\u5e6b\u52a9\u5718\u968a\u6709\u6548\u5728\u5bb6\u5de5\u4f5c\u76844\u9805\u57fa\u672c\u5de5\u5177](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/%e5%b9%ab%e5%8a%a9%e5%9c%98%e9%9a%8a%e6%9c%89%e6%95%88%e5%9c%a8%e5%ae%b6%e5%b7%a5%e4%bd%9c%e7%9a%844%e9%a0%85%e5%9f%ba%e6%9c%ac%e5%b7%a5%e5%85%b7/)\n\n# Read More News\n\n07/24/2017 Mon 10:46 AM in All markets by [Jerene\nAng](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/jerenea/ \"Posts by Jerene\nAng\")\n\n## [Are your trade secrets safe with ex-\nemployees?](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/are-your-trade-secrets-safe-\nwith-ex-employees/ \"Are your trade secrets safe with ex-employees?\")\n\n35% of senior executives in Asia were the most concerned about ex-staff\nstealing and sharing trade secrets...\n\n05/05/2015 Tue 23:21 PM in All markets by [Akankasha\nDewan](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/akankashad/ \"Posts by\nAkankasha Dewan\")\n\n## [More candidates in Asia Pacific are faking their\nresumes](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/candidates-asia-pacific-faking-\nresumes/ \"More candidates in Asia Pacific are faking their resumes\")\n\nBosses, beware!

Abuse\nreported during Zoomraids has included the use of racist, anti-Semitic and\npornographic imagery, as well as verbal harassment.\n\n### Zoom apologizes, again\n\n[Zoom conceded that its custom encryption is\nsubstandard](https://www.zdnet.com/article/zoom-concedes-custom-encryption-is-\nsub-standard-as-citizen-lab-pokes-holes-in-it/) after a Citizen Lab report\nfound the company had been rolling its own encryption scheme, using a less\nsecure AES-128 key instead of the AES-256 encryption it previously claimed to\nbe using. [In a direct\nresponse](https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/03/response-to-research-from-\nuniversity-of-torontos-citizen-lab/), Yuan said publicly, \"We recognize that\nwe can do better with our encryption design.\"\n\n### Second class action lawsuit filed\n\nTycko and Zavareei LLP filed a [class action lawsuit against\nZoom](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h078rfxsq4x22um/TZ_TaylorVZoom_Complaint_Final.pdf?dl=0)\n\\-- the second suit against the company -- for sharing users' personal\ninformation with Facebook.\n\n### Congress requests information\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jerry McNerney of California and 18 of his Democratic\ncolleagues from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce sent [a letter to\nYuan](https://mcnerney.house.gov/sites/mcnerney.house.gov/files/Letter%20to%20Zoom_04.03.2020.pdf)\nraising concerns and questions regarding the company's privacy practices.

Globally, it\nwas already becoming common to take your office with you, wherever you go.\nCOVID-19 has merely accelerated it for millions of organizations globally,\"\nsaid Stephen Mak, Vice President, BlackBerry Spark, Asia and Japan,\nBlackBerry.\n\n\"Benefits aside, remote working also exposes businesses to increased risk.\nAlready we have seen widespread reports of COVID-19 related phishing and\nmalware campaigns that impersonate government, authorities and businesses,\ntargeting both individuals and organizations. This will only increase the\nlonger we face this pandemic, as organizations, data and people remain\nvulnerable to those that exploit the situation.\n\n\"The key point is, securing apps, devices, and firewalls alone is no longer\nenough. Establishing highly functional and secure remote working\ninfrastructures has now become an absolute imperative for businesses to\nmaintain continuity while keeping staff safe remotely,\" he added.\n\n**Schroders**\n\n**Measures** :\n\n  * All offices across its 35 locations globally are fully operational, with most of the employees working remotely, in line with local government advice.

However, it is crucial for\nemployees to understand that while their workplace environment may have\ntemporarily changed, their conduct is held to the same standard as when they\nare present in the office, including with respect to any online\ncommunications.\n\n**The new normal - an online workplace**\n\nWith organisations now actively encouraging employees to leverage the various\ninstant online communication platforms available to them, including Microsoft\nTeams, Zoom, Slack, and other instant messaging platforms, it is crucial that\nemployees understand their responsibility to communicate in the same way as\nthey would in the workplace itself, and comply with all applicable workplace\npolicies.\n\nThere is no doubt that instant messaging can be an effective communication\ntool - however, employers should be managing the risks associated with this\nplatform in the same way as every other IT, communications, and social media\nplatform. Employers need to be just as vigilant of inappropriate behaviour\nwhile employees are working from home, if not more so than they would if\nemployees were working in the office environment. Instant messaging gives the\nperception that conversations held, or content posted on these platforms is\n\"private\" or confidential between the recipients, regardless of their\nconnection to the workplace.\n\nThere is a real risk that employees forget or just don't think that\ncommunications over these platforms are subject to the employer's workplace\npolicies in the same way other forms of communication are. Communications over\nthese types of platforms can be ripe for allegations of bullying, harassment,\nincluding sexual harassment and discrimination. Think sexual harassment\nthrough memes, GIFs and other \"light-hearted\" jokes to break the solitude or\ninappropriate 'banter' in a chat group to break up the day.\n\n**Cyberbullying \"at work\"**\n\nOur current working from home landscape also exposes employees to increased\nrisk of being the subject of cyberbullying, with employees utilising online\ncommunication tools to expose other employees to negative and attacking online\nbehaviours by way of email, instant messaging and video conferencing\nplatforms.\n\nSuch bullying can also go unnoticed by colleagues and unchecked by\nHR/management. An employee is bullied at work if a person or group of people\nrepeatedly act unreasonably towards them, and this behaviour creates a risk to\nthe employee's health and safety. Confusion often arises around what is\nconsidered to be \"at work\", particularly in the age of remote working,\nflexibility and online communications at employees' fingers tips at all times.\nWhile the law is constantly evolving with respect to the concept of \"at work\",\nit is accepted that bullying does not necessarily have to occur at the actual\nworkplace, however, it must occur while the worker is actively engaged in the\nperformance of work or some other activity which is authorised or permitted by\nthe employer. This may include a lunch break onsite, a work trip outside of\nthe normal working area, accessing social media while onsite, and relevantly,\nwhen working from home.\n\nIt is important to remember that employers and individual employees can be\nliable, vicariously and personally, respectively, for inappropriate conduct\nthat occurs \"at work\", which crucially extends to the inappropriate conduct of\nemployees working from home. Employers also must remain cognisant of their\nobligations from a work health and safety perspective to ensure that people\nare not being subjected to bullying type conduct.  With the Australian\nworkforce largely working from home it may even be easier for employees to be\nbullied without that being known, seen or heard.\n\n**Workers Compensation Claims**\n\nEmployers should, of course, be currently taking steps to ensure that\nemployees are taking steps to set up home offices/workspaces to be safe to\navoid physical injuries, however, it is equally important to remember that\nemployees who have been the victims of unlawful treatment, including bullying\nbehaviours, adverse action, and harassment, are also able to bring workers\ncompensation claims for any psychological injuries sustained as a result,\nprovided they are able to establish that the injury was arising out of or in\nthe course of their employment.  This includes any psychological injuries\nsustained while working from home.\n\n**Strategies to reduce inappropriate behaviour while working from home**\n\nIn our experience, it is apparent that employees seem much more likely to be\ncasual and even inappropriate over instant messaging communications than in\nperson or via email. Given the heavily increased use of such communication\nmethods while employees are working from home, and in order to mitigate the\nrisks associated with employees engaging in inappropriate conduct while\nworking from home, it is recommended that your organisation consider the\nfollowing tips:\n\n  * Stay in touch! Maintaining regular contact with employees is now more important than ever, and HR and management functions should seek to ensure that they maintain regular contact with their employees.\n  * Remind employees of workplace policies in force, particularly Social Media and IT Usage policies, and where these policies can be accessed.\n  * Employees should be reminded that anything put in an instant message should be something that they would be willing to say to a colleague's face in person or via email.  If this is not the case, the communication is likely inappropriate.\n  * Remind employees that all communications over the organisation's IT systems, including all instant messages on chat programs such as Teams, are stored by the organisation and can be reviewed at a later date.\n  * If you have specific concerns about behaviours or a pattern of behaviours, be prompt in addressing these concerns.\n  * Ensure that you have a Workplace Surveillance Policy and/or employment contracts that provide sufficient notice to your employees that you may monitor any online communication made using the organisation's IT systems.\n  * Review your communications software to ensure data is retained and accessible to the organisation.  Be careful - it can be more difficult on some communication platforms than others to obtain message history.\n  * If your communications software allows for employees to record video calls, ensure all employees are aware of this feature and your organisation's policies regarding the recording of video calls and notification/consent of such.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember that in times of uncertainty, culture is\ndriven from the top, with employees looking to management teams and executives\nfor direction. On this basis, it is important that HR and management teams are\nleading by example and ensuring all of their own behaviours and communications\nare appropriate, not only those communications which are widely disseminated\nbut also communications in individual and smaller team situations.\n\nThis is a time of great uncertainty and worry for employees, where\ncommunication is vital and any light relief is, generally, welcomed. While we\ncertainly don't want to be the fun police, it is important to remember that\nthere is often a fine line between the 'banter' and the unlawful act. With\nemployees now sitting behind cameras or at the end of phones and instant\nmessaging platforms, it's even more difficult to gauge colleagues' reactions\nand perceptions. Intent is not relevant to a legal defence.

channels are well suited to handle or automate simple inquiries,\nemployees continue to rely on a personalized, one-on-one agent experience over\nthe phone to handle more complex, sensitive, or urgent inquiries. In fact,\nrecent research1 revealed 74% of globally surveyed individuals called a\ncontact center in 2019 for assistance.\n\n\u201cThe HR Department handles a wide variety of employee inquiries, from\nsensitive information to recruitment and professional development\nopportunities. The nature of these calls tends to be time sensitive, so it is\ncritical for the telephony platform to direct the caller to the right agent,\u201d\nsays Denis Seynhaeve, 3CLogic\u2019s CEO. \u201cWith the natively-integrated IVR\ndesigner for ServiceNow, employee details are collected upfront and callers\nare automatically routed to the most qualified agent, ensuring more time is\nspent handling the inquiry and less spent waiting in line.\u201d\n\n## Advertisement\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\n## Article content continued\n\nThe manufacturing firm also plans to extend the ServiceNow certified cloud\ncall center capabilities to its IT and customer service teams leveraging\nServiceNow\u2019s ITSM and CSM suites, with the potential to expand into over 20\ncountries.\n\n **About 3CLogic**\n\n3CLogic is a leading cloud contact center platform modernizing enterprise\ncommunications with their employees and customers.

MacArthur\")\n\n[H.V. MacArthur](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/)Contributor\n\nOpinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own.\n\n[Careers](/careers)\n\nI write about navigating the unspoken rules in today\u2019s workplace.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\n![Hearing test showing ear of young woman with sound waves simulation\ntechnology](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/843526408/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nGetty\n\nThe hard of hearing community has been contributing to the success of business\nglobally in all kinds of industries. They\u2019ve navigated the challenges of\nbuilding connections even when dealing with the issues of fast paced\nconversations and multiple speakers in meeting settings. They\u2019ve adapted by\nlearning to read lips, pick up on speech patterns and build support networks\nwith peers to help them keep pace with their fully hearing capable\ncounterparts.\n\nSome of us may feel like this really has nothing to do with our own work\nexperience. But based on the following items of note from the [Disabled World\nOrganization](https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/types/hearing/\n\"https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/types/hearing/\") and the [World\nHealth Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-\nsheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss \"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-\nsheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss\"), you are bound to know, work with or\neven become someone who is hard of hearing.\n\n  * Approximately 432 million adults worldwide have a disabling hearing loss. It is estimated that by 2050, more than 900 million people will have a disabling hearing loss.\n  * There is a progressive loss of ability to hear high frequencies with increasing age known as presbycusis. For men, this can start as early as 25 and women at 30, but may even affect teenagers and children.\n  * People who are severely hard of hearing rely a lot on lip-reading, even with a hearing aid. Profoundly deaf people can also use [sign language to communicate](https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/types/hearing/communication/ \"https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/types/hearing/communication/\"). Hard of hearing persons with partial loss of hearing may find that the quality of their hearing varies from day to day, or from one situation to another or not at all. They may also, to a greater or lesser extent, need to depend on both hearing-aids and lip-reading.\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\n  * [\n\n### How To Maintain Your Mental Health During The Coronavirus Crisis\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2020/04/07/how-to-maintain-your-\nmental-health-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/)\n\n[Jill Gardner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/missjillyg/\n\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/missjillyg/\"), a learning solutions leader who\nhas worked at companies such as The Walt Disney Company, Deloitte and Farmers\nInsurance, is no stranger to the world of being hard of hearing community. She\nhas lived with profound hearing loss for most of her life and, with use of\nhearing aids, has navigated situations from overcrowded conference room\nmeetings where high risk decisions are being made to traveling internationally\ndealing with various cultures and languages. But working remotely has caused\nher to take a pause.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always found a way to make sure being hard of hearing didn\u2019t get in my\nway. I\u2019ve even managed teams remotely. But in that scenario, I have the\nability to get to know each person\u2019s speech patterns. It helps decipher what\nthey\u2019re saying when trying to read lips on a video screen.\u201d But now, like the\nmany others in her similar situation, she has been flung into operating 100%\nthrough remote platforms.\n\nThe challenges that crop up for the hard of hearing employees goes beyond what\nthe rest of us are experiencing.\n\n**Below are some examples of how those who are fully hearing capable have more\nthan a leg up on those that are hard of hearing through this work from home\nshift:**\n\n  * When the video freezes but the audio continues, hearing participants can bypass the minutes lost and go off the audio. Hard of hearing participants cannot.\n  * If the platform crashes and the call is moved to audio only, hearing participants can move on with business as usual while the hard of hearing participants have to struggle to keep up.\n  * If there are several people speaking at once, hearing people can pick out what to listen to and what to ignore while hard of hearing people are stuck with a garbled mess to pick through hoping to find the right thing to focus on. \n  * When someone turns around or steps away from the camera, hearing people can pick up on what they\u2019re saying even if they can\u2019t see them. Hard of hearing people have to hope someone repeats what they say or may not even be aware that something was even said.\n  * Since hearing people are still the majority, they don\u2019t have to think about the hard of hearing workers\u2019 experience the way that hard of hearing people absolutely have to study and adapt to the hearing world.\n\nBut not thinking about the needs of those who are hard of hearing sets\nbusinesses up to miss out on the rich and diverse talents of this minority and\never-growing population. [AI Media](https://www.ai-media.tv/ \"https://www.ai-\nmedia.tv/\") recently posted a list of [33 famous hard-of-hearing\npeople](https://blog.ai-media.tv/blog/famous-deaf-people \"https://blog.ai-\nmedia.tv/blog/famous-deaf-people\") that ranges from Bill Clinton, a past\nPresident known for his ability to negotiate and connect with others, to\nThomas Edison, one of America\u2019s greatest inventors, and even including Stephen\nColbert, a popular political satirist and tv show host.\n\nWhat can we do? The solution is multi-leveled. In short, it takes a collective\neffort to foster a true culture of inclusivity. But you can take action\nwherever your sphere of influence resides.\n\nBelow are tips Jill Gardner shared from the perspective of a hard of hearing\nemployee, leader and HR professional.\n\n  * **As senior leaders and HR professionals** , you are front and center for leading the charge to ensure inclusivity during this sudden shift to working from home. You should be focused on investigating, providing and allowing for reasonable accommodations in the home similar to the workplace. For example, allowing employees to purchase or take-home key equipment. Companies would also do well to understand and implement accessible and assistive technologies. This includes live captioning or subtitles and screen readers during web conferencing and video calls. \n  * **Managers should get to know the individuals on their team**. This will help them understand what all their employees, but in particular, what their hard of hearing team members need to do their best work. This includes being flexible to how they prefer to communicate (e.g., phone/RTT/TTY, online textchat, text message, email, etc.) and how often. They should also demonstrate and encourage empathy to all team members to help balance the unique needs of each and the impact of that. Connect frequently with individual team members, as well as the entire team \u2013 you cannot over-communicate with remote workers.\n  * **Peers can  and should reach out without stressing out.** Use video vs. an audio call with your hard of hearing team member. Don\u2019t assume you have to rely on text messaging or email with the team member who is hard of hearing. Find what works and use it. Help enable them to be part of the discussion and decision making. \n  * **Individuals who are hard of hearing need to speak up and be honest about their needs.** Not only does this encourage others to do the same, but it also sets people up to stop tiptoeing or avoiding the topic and tackle it head on. Engage with your manager and team to identify inclusion solutions for your organization.\n\nJill Gardner highlighted that the technology for closed captioned has been\nslow in advancing for video conferencing. Though we\u2019ve had [closed captioned\ntechnology](https://www.ncicap.org/about-us/history-of-closed-captioning/\n\"https://www.ncicap.org/about-us/history-of-closed-captioning/\") since the\nearly 70\u2019s, we\u2019ve seen little of those advancements hit the world of remote\nwork until recent years. WebEex and Zoom have begun offering closed caption\noptions recently, which is a positive start in the right direction. But we all\nhave to make sure we are savvy at setting up meetings and other forms of\ncommunication to ensure accessibility.\n\n**Everyone can take the initiative with these meeting best practices :that can\nhelp everyone.**\n\n  * Use a video conferencing platform that provides instant or live closed captioning, ensuring that meetings are set up ahead of time with this feature enabled.\n  * Ensure one person is speaking at a time.\n  * Call on anyone who hasn\u2019t had a chance to participate.\n  * Assign a facilitator to ensure the meeting stays focused and on track.\n  * Use video to engage visually and, ensuring encourage people are looking atto face the camera when speaking.\n  * Send Follow up with a written summary of key points discussed and decisions made.\n\nWith 60% of people with hearing loss working in the workforce or in\neducational settings and many older Americans are staying in the workforce\nlonger, it is critical that we all participate in building an inclusive\nenvironment for those with hearing challenges, especially in this climate of\nremote work.\n\n\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/lmtpconsulting) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heather-macarthur-9ba8703/).

At\nour annual flagship event you\u2019ll have the chance to connect with over 1,500\nfounders, startup enthusiasts, corporates, angel investors, VCs, and the\nmedia, learn from 70+ expert speakers, take part in workshops with\ninternationally successful founders, network (via our app!) and bite your\nnails through our exciting pitch competition.\n\nToday we are excited to announce a new panel discussion during the EU-Startups\nSummit: **_\u201cThe future of HR:_** _ **How will technologies influence the\nhiring process in the coming years? \"**_\n\nTimes have certainly changed since the original job application process. Not\nso long ago, a face-to-face interview with a company\u2019s human resources team\nwas the go-to method for hiring a new team member. As companies become more\nglobal, digital and diverse, there are more complexities to take into\nconsideration, such as video interviews for remote workers, using AI to sift\nthrough hundreds of CVs, and making sure that there is the right support in\nplace for diverse applicants. How do we not just manage the challenges going\nforward, and but actually make hiring more efficient, inclusive and human?\n\nJoining us for this chat will be 3 CEOs of companies that are disrupting the\nway we hire in Europe and beyond: [Fritz\nTrott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fwtrott/) of **Zenjob** , [Karoli\nHindriks](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karolihindriks/) of **Jobbatical** , and\n[Stephen Quinn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-quinn-477b0210/) of\n**Jobbio**.\n\n![](https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Jobbio-150x150.png)[**Jobbio**](https://www.jobbio.com/),\nheadquartered in Dublin, has revolutionised the hiring process with its\ncareers marketplace that connects talent and companies directly, cost\neffectively and quickly. Hundreds of thousands of professionals use Jobbio\neach month, accessing roles posted by over 10,000 companies globally,\nincluding Slack, Airbnb and Ryanair. Job seekers can search and learn about\ncompanies, and create profiles to apply directly when the right company comes\nalong. Companies get a complete hiring platform, including a branded profile,\nmarketing, and applicant management. What's more, Jobbio has a growing media\nand publisher partner programme for organisations who want to build their jobs\nbusiness.\n\n![](https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Zen-\njobs-150x150.png)[**Zenjob**](https://www.zenjob.de/), headquartered in\nBerlin, is matching students who need to financially support themselves with\ncompanies looking to fill part-time positions with enthusiastic young minds.\nVia its technology, it connects both sides in a very short time, offering an\nonline booking tool and a unique matching method. Thanks to this approach, its\nplatform has helped over 1100 companies post more than 12,000 jobs to over\n15000 active students each month. The team also promotes its mantra as\ninspiration for users on its platform: stay Hungry, Helpful, Humble and\nHonest.\n\n![](https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Jobbatical-150x150.png)[**Jobbatical**](https://jobbatical.com/)\nis on a mission to help tech companies relocate the top global talent - with\nzero hassle. It helps companies firstly physically relocate, and secondly\nonboard new team members from anywhere in the world, whilst saving time,\ncutting paperwork, and staying one step ahead of unexpected issues.

Real-time engagement, transparency with co-workers,\nand regular, meaningful interaction is imperative to helping remote workers\nfeel like they are trusted and part of a larger team and not on their own\nisland.\n\nTechnology is extremely important in creating these connections and empowering\nemployees. Real-time streaming calls, video chats, messaging boards, and more,\nfacilitate opportunities for open lines of communication that lead to more\ncollaboration and encouragement across a team or company. When employees feel\nmore connected and involved, they understand the larger picture of what their\nwork is contributing to for the company overall, which in turn helps them\nproduce the highest quality standard of work.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Can Distributed Teams Outperform Traditional Teams? Q &A;\nWith Grant Thornton\u2019s David Boland and Michelle\nSmith**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/mobile-workforce/can-\ndistributed-teams-outperform-traditional-teams-qa-with-grant-thorntons-david-\nboland-and-michelle-smith/)\n\n**Which new technologies can help HR Leaders to engage and retain a remote\nworkforce?**\n\nTechnology has changed the game for remote working standards, making\ncommunication and collaboration much easier. If you can\u2019t provide a brick-and-\nmortar office, you must manufacture it. Because connecting with co-workers is\nnow possible in real-time, fewer miscommunications are happening, and remote\nworkers are feeling more like they are part of something larger. Fostering\ndeeper connections with remote workers is an important aspect of retaining a\nhappy and productive employee.\n\nSince we are a real-time voice and video platform, we use our own products\ndaily to stay in touch with remote workers through conferencing, audio/video\nchats and live streaming. Other technologies like WeChat can help remote\nworkforces to build camaraderie through instant message and voice calls. In\nterms of HR, technologies and platforms like PerformYard keep remote workers\u2019\nperformance transparent and organized through tracking and managing goals and\nreviews.\n\n> **One of the most important aspects to using technology to engage and retain\n> a remote workforce is to ensure it is compatible and user-friendly for all\n> employees. For example, we have a large employee presence in Shanghai, so it\n> is crucial that we use apps that are best suited for their needs, as well as\n> our employees in the US. They don\u2019t have easy access to the Google Suite and\n> Slack isn't used very much, so we had to adjust. Companies should take the\n> tools\u2019 accessibility and ease of use into account for its entire\n> workforce.**\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Coronavirus and Remote Work: Implementing a Work-From-Home\nPolicy Overnight**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-\nworkforce/coronavirus-work-from-home-policy/)\n\n**Can you recommend a book for talent leaders that\u2019ll help them understand the\npsychology of a remote worker? Tell us about the 3 most important takeaways\nfrom this book.**\n\n[**_Working Remotely_**](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Working-\nRemotely/Teresa-Douglas/9781506254333) ** _by Teresa Douglas_** completely\ntransformed my outlook on remote working and informed many of the initiatives\nand approaches I\u2019ve taken as the VP of People at Agora. The book is written\nentirely by remote workers from Kaplan, for remote workers, so its\nauthenticity and honesty are extremely relatable and realistic to other remote\nworkforces today, regardless of their industry.\n\nThere are many important takeaways from the book, but I\u2019ve outlined the top\nthree below:\n\n  1. **Remote workers \u201cadult\u201d well:** Remote employees aren\u2019t working in an office with their teammates and managers; hence they strengthen important skills to keep themselves on track. Remote workers are more self-aware, responsible, mindful, trusted by others, and in turn, trusting in others.  \n\n  2. **Successful remote employees are very in tune with their physicality, presence and surroundings:** They are more thoughtful about their physical availability, as well as about creating and maintaining a conductive workspace. They also make the effort more to get out into their community, tend to their health and create space to be present with their families.  \n\n  3. **Remote employees communicate explicitly and want the same in return:** These workers are more likely to set expectations about almost everything: availability and boundaries, preferred methods of communication, and the way they want to be managed and recognized. They actively engage and make the effort to over-communicate to compensate for the inability to communicate in passing, tacitly, or through osmosis.\n\nI would highly recommend _Working Remotely_ as a must-read for managers and HR\nprofessionals working in a remote setting, or with remote employees. The\nfirst-hand experiences of the authors can provide insight into this unique\ntype of worker and how best to approach their management, communications, and\ncareer path support.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How To Remote Work Like a\nBoss**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/how-to-\nremote-work-like-a-boss/)\n\n**What\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve received so far on how to manage a remote\nworkforce?**\n\n> **The best advice I received about managing a remote workforce came directly\n> from a remote employee. They told me that we, as a company, the management\n> team and coworkers need to work harder to make them feel connected and part\n> of the team.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nStephen Baer\n\nHead of Creative Strategy and Innovation at [The Game\nAgency](http://www.thegameagency.com/) and The Training Arcade, creating\nsolutions that educate and activate audiences.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nPhoto:\n\nGetty\n\nFrom dawn to dusk: That\u2019s how long the[ average adult spends on-\nscreen](https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/article/2018/time-flies-us-\nadults-now-spend-nearly-half-a-day-interacting-with-media/) \u2014 about 11 hours\ndaily.\n\nAt the same time, corporate trainers are trying to grab employee attention\nlong enough to educate them and ensure the information sticks. Tools like EJ4\nlet viewers watch five- to 10-minute training videos, while Google Primer\nprovides five-minute interactive lessons on the go, and our platform, The\nTraining Arcade, offers three- to five-minute microgames to reinforce\ninformation and assess learner knowledge. Each of these bite-sized and user-\nfriendly tools takes the limited time (and attention) users have into account.\n\n**Microlearning**\n\nThis reframing of content through microlearning can be easily applied to any\ncorporate training program. Instead of long, constantly interrupted courses,\nmicrolearning is brief and easily digestible. It\u2019s ultra-focused with precise,\nmeasurable goals. _ ** **_ Above all, microlearning helps make training simple\nand fun.\n\nIs it necessary to update tried-and-true training methods? We say yes.\nMillennials are claiming the place of baby boomers as[ America\u2019s largest adult\ngeneration](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/01/millennials-\novertake-baby-boomers/), and as digital natives, they think differently.\nThat\u2019s why passive training doesn\u2019t always work anymore. Across multiple\nplatforms, microlearning can increase learner engagement with audio, video and\ngames without wasting valuable time.\n\nMicrolearning is built on[ cognitive\nscience](https://www.chieflearningofficer.com/2019/04/10/the-brain-science-\nbehind-scenario-based-microlearning/). It uses spaced repetition,[ a proven\nretention-boosting\nmethod](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5476736/) of breaking\ndown learning topics into more manageable pieces and repeating them with\nadequate spacing between lessons. This learning technique accesses the\nlearner\u2019s working memory bank, which makes microlearning worth consideration\nfor any employer seeking to teach candidates hard skills.\n\nLet\u2019s explore industries that have implemented microlearning:\n\n**Manufacturing And Transportation**\n\nThrough a combination of retiring experts, rapidly advancing technologies and\nunderskilled newcomers, these industries are facing an uphill battle when it\ncomes to training. Keurig Dr Pepper has acquired a number of distributors and\nbottlers over the years, resulting in a geographically dispersed workforce and\ndifferent standards of business. In an effort to train employees on a standard\nway of doing business, the company developed a series of [brief training\nvideos](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/155473/ej4_V2_September-2017/PDF/DPS__ej4_Case_Study.pdf?__hssc=249044440.1.1583860953668&__hstc=249044440.a6774316826d0a43e68b128fb7be03a7.1583860953667.1583860953667.1583860953667.1&__hsfp=1989052955&hsCtaTracking=71068aa9-8242-4d7f-8a20-56a590c947ef%7Cf3d85185-8832-4e44-809b-db563de4da60)\navailable on desktop and mobile that cover a variety of topics, including HR\ncompliance, sales techniques and communication skills.\n\n**Technology**\n\nAs an industry leader on the pulse of what\u2019s next, it\u2019s easy to see why Google\nentered the microlearning space. In 2014, the technology giant launched Google\nPrimer, a free mobile app with five-minute interactive lessons designed to\nempower startups and small businesses with knowledge about search engine\noptimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), content marketing, audience\nmeasurement, branding, business planning and many other subjects. Courses can\nbe taken on the go, in a plane, on the subway, at a coffee shop or just about\nanywhere else. Today, over 10 million learners have downloaded the app.\n\n**Healthcare And Pharmaceutical**\n\nHealthcare professionals deal with high-demand situations every day: long\nhours, patients in need and sometimes life-or-death situations. Our firm\ncreated Dr. Neb, a game that helps clinicians who treat patients with\nuncontrolled COPD to identify the best solution to prescribe. These games\noffer a series of branching dialogue, virtual conversations between doctors\nand patients, laid out with a storybook narrative much like a comic book with\nvoice bubbles.\n\nMerck, a multinational pharmaceutical company, leveraged Axonify\u2019s\nmicrolearning, gamification and adaptive learning platform across 52 global\nmanufacturing sites to improve its safety culture. With an 80% voluntary\nparticipation rate, the company saw a decrease in recordable incidents and a\ndecrease in lost time injury frequency rates.\n\nBeyond games and videos, here are a few solutions worth considering when\ncreating your microlearning strategy.\n\n**1\\. Animations**\n\nAnimation is a powerful tool. In a recent\n[study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190221122929.htm)\npublished in _Neuron_ , researchers discovered that the brain absorbs about\n80% of an environment\u2019s sensory information. This hyperdigestion is why\ncorporations and government institutions like Cleveland Water[ utilize video-\ncreation\nservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsF54SDIPOw&feature=emb_logo) like\nVyond, Powtoon or Moovly to produce studio-level videos.\n\nLearners are easily distracted by texts, instant messages, emails, social\nmedia, phone calls, fitness trackers, etc. This means every second counts.\nWhen fighting for their attention and retention, a well-crafted video enables\nyou to pull your audience away from everyday distractions and deliver\nmemorable content. By creating videos with relatable characters, environments\nand situations, training leaders can help learners remember concepts and\ndetails that they might otherwise forget.\n\n**2\\. Infographics**\n\nInfographics help learners digest information, show a hierarchy of data and\nillustrate a point in a condensed visual manner. Beyond training, IBM uses[\ninfographics to streamline\nrecruiting](https://www.slideshare.net/vismeapp/how-ibm-uses-infographics-to-\nattract-and-hire-top-talent-case-study). HR professionals can find\ninfographics tools like Piktochart and Visme handy in building a stronger\ncompany culture.\n\nDo you believe the adage that a picture is worth a thousand words? A well-\ndesigned infographic is worth even more. Visuals can help learners process\ninformation faster and store information longer by appealing to emotions. When\ndesigning your infographic, follow these rules:\n\n\u2022 Write a headline that clearly states the purpose of the infographic.\n\n\u2022 Choose a simple layout with lots of blank space.\n\n\u2022 Write clear and concise text.\n\n\u2022 Ensure all visuals (e.g., charts and graphics) are clear without\nexplanation.\n\n\u2022 Make all fonts and color combinations easy to read and appropriate for the\ntopic.\n\n**3\\. Chatbots**\n\nWhen it\u2019s time for coaching and reinforcement of training, some teams bristle.\nOlder methods \u2014 like dreaded compliance meetings \u2014 can feel patronizing, or\nworse, like a big waste of time. Chatbot platforms, such as Mobile Coach,\ncreate chatbots for meaningful outreach and useful conversations on the\nemployee\u2019s schedule.\n\nAs consumers, most of us are familiar with chatbots, but this technology has\nevolved and is being used more and more for new employee onboarding, customer\nservice, sales training, diversity training and several other topics.\nDesigning a chatbot is as much an art as a science, but when done right, it\ncan be a very effective tool for introducing new concepts, providing\nreminders, tracking goals and assessing knowledge.\n\n**Train The Next Generation With Microlearning**\n\nYounger learners will increasingly be joining the workforce, so it\u2019s time for\nindustries across the board to meet their training needs. Companies who do\nwill find themselves ahead of the curve, with employees who are engaged in\ntraining and can recall what they\u2019ve learned.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Stephen Baer](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2019/08/Stephen-\nBaer_avatar_1567014500.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/stephenbaer/\n\"Photo of Stephen Baer\")\n\n[Stephen\nBaer](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/stephenbaer/)\n\nHead of Creative Strategy & Innovation at [The Game\nAgency](http://www.thegameagency.com) and The Training Arcade, creating\nsolutions that educate and activate audiences.

Because you will deliver the\nmessage remotely, you must take extra care to break the news with empathy and\ncompassion. Your aim is to treat people with dignity, fairness, and respect.\nOffer a short explanation about the economic conditions that led to the\nlayoff. Stress that the dismissal is not the employee's fault. Rather, it's\nthe result of a global circumstance none of created. Even if you're worried\nthat you, too, might lose your job, don't make the situation about you. Find\nsomeone to vent to--a peer or mentor perhaps, and an outlet for your stress.\nBut don't allow your personal pressures to creep into your interactions with\nyour team. As a manager, you need to be there for your people.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/04/Apr20_07_MaxwellHolyoke-\nHirsch.jpg) Illustration by Maxwell Holyoke-Hirsch\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/04/how-to-manage-coronavirus-layoffs-with-\ncompassion?language=es)\n\nWe\u2019ve made our [coronavirus coverage](/insight-\ncenter/coronavirus?ab=articlewidget-insightcenter-coronavirus) free for all\nreaders.

Managers are not only dealing with\nthe stress and sadness of having to let go of a large number of their workers,\nmany of them are also feeling underlying anxiety about their own positions.\nEven if laying off employees is the only way to keep the organization running,\nhow do you handle your feelings of guilt and sadness? How should you deliver\nthe news when you can\u2019t meet face-to-face? What should you say to your\nemployees who remain? And what can you do to manage fear about your own\nfuture?\n\n### **What the Experts Say**\n\nLaying off employees is difficult in normal times; but amidst the Covid-19\nglobal health crisis, the task is \u201cemotionally and cognitively overwhelming,\u201d\naccording to Joshua Margolis, a professor at Harvard Business School. \u201cThis\nexperience for most of us is unfathomable,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of\nuncertainty and people\u2019s minds are whirring.\u201d As a manager charged with\ndismissing a wide swath of employees, \u201cyou\u2019re pulled in different directions:\nYour heart goes out to people, but you have a responsibility to the\norganization.\u201d That tension is magnified when you\u2019re also worried about your\nown fate, says Kenneth Freeman, Dean Emeritus at Boston University\u2019s Questrom\nSchool of Business. \u201cYou\u2019re human and you\u2019re going to have a lot of those 2 AM\nmoments,\u201d he says. But the key is to try as best you can to separate your\npersonal worries from the task at hand. \u201cIn your role as a manager, you need\nto be there for your people.\u201d Here are some recommendations.\n\n### **Leaders: Reflect on whether layoffs are needed**\n\nIf you\u2019re the one making the decisions about layoffs, Margolis recommends\nasking yourself one question: [is downsizing your workforce truly\nnecessary?](/2020/03/the-coronavirus-crisis-doesnt-have-to-lead-to-layoffs)\nThe impulse to cut costs is understandable, but \u201cthis is not a periodic\nrecession.\u201d Rather, this pandemic represents \u201can exceptional historic moment\nthat will end up being pivotal for the economy and for people\u2019s communities,\ncareers, and lives,\u201d and it might \u201cwarrant a different response.\u201d As a leader,\nyou need to spark \u201cresourceful, creative thinking about how your organization\ncan save as many jobs as possible.\u201d Freeman suggests gathering your management\nteam and asking, \u201cCan we make sacrifices elsewhere? What are our other options\nto [reduce costs](/2020/03/a-5-day-plan-to-keep-your-company-afloat?ab=hero-\nsubleft-3)?\u201d Your goal is to think broadly about how you distribute the\nwidespread negative consequences of Covid-19. \u201cLaying off people should be the\nlast resort,\u201d he says. And if you must do layoffs, make every effort to \u201cavoid\nmultiple rounds\u201d of cuts.\n\n### **Gather information**\n\nIf you decide layoffs are necessary or others have made that decision for you,\nthen make sure you\u2019re prepared before you reach out to the affected employees.\nFigure out \u201chow and when you will deliver the news to your employees on an\nindividual basis\u201d and what the message will consist of, says Freeman. People\nare likely going to have [a lot of questions about the timing, their benefits,\nand severance](/2020/03/7-questions-to-raise-immediately-after-youre-laid-\noff). These conversations may need to happen fast, but you\u2019ll have a better\nchance of easing your own and the employee\u2019s anxiety if you can provide them\nwith answers about what happens next. Reach out to HR, your legal department,\nand any other senior leaders who might be able to help you prepare answers to\nquestions such as \u201cWhen will I get my last paycheck?\u201d and \u201cWhat happens to my\n401K?\u201d\n\n### **Understand your limitations**\n\nEven if you\u2019ve presided over layoffs in the past, overseeing them during the\ncoronavirus outbreak will be different for one key reason: they won\u2019t take\nplace in person because of social distancing measures. What\u2019s more, you need\nto have a highly private conversation at a time when privacy is difficult to\nachieve. \u201cWe all have families under foot and lots of things going on,\u201d says\nMargolis. He suggests asking your employee, \u201cIs there a time when I can get 15\nminutes of your full attention?\u201d Be forewarned: you may get pushback. They may\nanticipate what\u2019s coming and \u201csome people aren\u2019t going to have the\npsychological wherewithal to deal with it,\u201d he says. In this case, he\nrecommends saying something like, \u201cCan you let me know when you\u2019re ready to\nhave this conversation so I can tell you the next steps?\u201d\n\n### **Set the right tone**\n\nBecause you will deliver the message remotely, Freeman says that you must\n[take extra care to break the news \u201cwith empathy and\ncompassion](/2016/02/a-guide-to-being-compassionate-during-layoffs).\u201d Your aim\nis to \u201ctreat people with dignity, fairness, and respect.\u201d Even though you may\nworry that you, too, might get laid-off, this particular termination is not\nabout you. \u201cThis is not a time for you to take up space,\u201d says Margolis. Don\u2019t\nsuccumb to your insecurities by saying something like, \u201cThis is really hard\nfor me.\u201d At the same time, don\u2019t \u201ctotally detach from your humanity\u201d so that\nyou \u201cbecome a mechanical robot.\u201d Instead, find a way \u201cto engage your emotion\u201d\nand cultivate a \u201ccalm and low-key\u201d manner. Ideally, you will have the\nconversation via video link so that you can \u201cmake eye contact\u201d with the other\nperson. If the conversation takes place on the phone, free yourself of all\ndistractions. \u201cBe fully present and listen.\u201d\n\n### **Be direct and human**\n\nYour message should be \u201cclear, concise, and unequivocal,\u201d says Margolis. For\ninstance, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but at end of next week we are terminating your job.\u201d\nImparting an \u201cexpeditious, direct message can feel cold, but it allows the\nother person to process what you\u2019re saying,\u201d he says. Express gratitude for\ntheir hard work and dedication. Then offer a short and simple explanation\nabout the economic conditions that led to the layoff. \u201cStress that this is not\nabout a specific job performance,\u201d says Freeman. \u201cThis is not the employee\u2019s\nfault. [This is about a global circumstance](/2020/03/understanding-the-\neconomic-shock-of-coronavirus) that none of us created.\u201d Acknowledge, too,\nthat one of the difficult things about being laid off during this crisis is\nthat coworkers won\u2019t get a chance to say goodbye in person. For a lot people,\n\u201ccolleagues are part of their extended family.\u201d Try to convey the message, \u201cWe\nall care about you.\u201d\n\n### **Offer assistance \u2014 but don\u2019t overpromise**\n\nFreeman recommends \u201cbeing readily available\u201d and willing to provide \u201csupport\nand counsel\u201d to your employee even after the initial conversation. Recognize\nthat this person may need time to process the news and [may have\nquestions](/2020/03/7-questions-to-raise-immediately-after-youre-laid-off) for\nyou later. \u201cThey might come back to reconnect or seek your advice.\u201d Be\nhelpful. Provide information on where your employee should go for government\nbenefits. Offer ideas about job opportunities at other organizations. Offer to\nserve as a reference. But, cautions Margolis, \u201cdon\u2019t overcommit to things you\ncan\u2019t deliver.\u201d For instance, \u201cyou may feel tempted to say, \u2018As things get\nclearer, and the economy improves, you\u2019re on our list to come back,\u2019\u201d he says.\nBut no one has that kind of foresight. \u201cDon\u2019t sugarcoat and don\u2019t give false\nhope.\u201d\n\n### **Be transparent**\n\nIn times like these, your remaining employees will look to you for comfort \u2014\nand an explanation, says Freeman. \u201cThe survivors are going to be worried about\ntheir jobs,\u201d he says. The fact is, \u201cno one knows where this is going to end,\u201d\nso the \u201conus is on you to be as transparent as possible.\u201d He recommends you\nhold an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d session \u2014 an open forum of sorts \u2014 so that \u201crumors\ndon\u2019t take over.\u201d You will need \u201ca succinct explanation for why the layoffs\nwere necessary,\u201d says Margolis. He recommends something like, \u201cThe\norganization is facing a challenge unlike anything it has ever faced. Let me\ntell you what we did, why we did it, and how we can move on.\u201d Then it\u2019s up to\nyou to \u201cabsorb their tension and agitation\u201d and listen to their concerns. You\nneed to \u201cexude a commitment to continue to move forward,\u201d he says.\n\n### **Vent (selectively)**\n\nThis is an [excruciatingly stressful time for everyone](/2020/03/coping-with-\nfatigue-fear-and-panic-during-a-crisis), and managers often bear an extra\nburden, says Freeman. \u201cYou feel responsible for the livelihoods of your team\nand for the health and wellbeing of their families,\u201d says Freeman. One of the\nmany ways that people \u201ccope with turbulence\u201d is by going to [routines and\nrituals](/2020/04/the-restorative-power-of-ritual), says Margolis. But because\nof widespread lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders, our routines \u201chave been\ndisrupted.\u201d It\u2019s critical, therefore, that you have \u201ca place where you can\nvent, release tension, and where you deal with your worries.\u201d Find someone\nelse you can talk to \u2014 a peer perhaps, a mentor, or a colleague at a different\norganization. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to articulate in certain circles that you don\u2019t know\nabout your own future and that unleashes worry.\u201d But be selective and cautious\nabout how much stress and emotion you show to your team. \u201cAll eyes are on you\u201d\nto provide a path forward.\n\n### **Focus on your wellbeing**\n\nFinally, take care of yourself, says Margolis. \u201cHopefully, this is the only\ntime you face something of this magnitude. But it\u2019s unlikely to be the only\ntime you face a challenge during a period of great uncertainty.\u201d The best\ncoping mechanism for when you can\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s in store for you is\n[self-care](/2017/06/6-ways-to-weave-self-care-into-your-workday).\u201d Eat\nhealthy, wholesome food; get regular exercise; [try meditating](/2020/03/why-\nleaders-need-meditation-now-more-than-ever); get plenty of sleep at night;\nread a good book. [A little perspective helps too](/2020/03/youre-not-\npowerless-in-the-face-of-uncertainty). After all, \u201cyou are not alone,\u201d says\nFreeman. Unfortunately, \u201cthere are a lot of supervisors going through this.\u201d\n** **\n\n### **Principles to Remember**\n\n**Do:  **\n\n  * Think carefully about whether layoffs are necessary and reflect on ways your organization can save as many jobs as possible.\n  * Show compassion for your employee and stress that the layoff is not their fault.\n  * Seek out a peer or a colleague outside your organization to whom you can vent and ask for help in coping with your own uncertainty.\n\n**Don\u2019t:  **\n\n  * Overcommit. Provide support and counsel to the people you\u2019ve laid off, but don\u2019t promise things you can\u2019t deliver.\n  * Make this about you. Avoid saying things like, \u201cThis is really hard for me.\u201d\n  * Neglect your wellbeing. Make a concerted effort to eat well and get enough sleep, and take time for self-care, including exercise and meditation.\n\n_The cases below are from people who have presided over layoffs in the past.\nWhile the circumstances today are unique, hopefully the previous experience of\nleaders provides some helpful lessons._\n\n### **Case Study #1: Part of your job is to absorb the emotion**\n\nLeah Solivan, the founder and former CEO of TaskRabbit, the online marketplace\nthat lets people hire freelancers for odd jobs, says the recent rash of\nlayoffs due to the coronavirus crisis is giving her ugly flashbacks. \u201cI feel\nlike I have PTSD,\u201d she says. \u201cI know exactly how these founders and managers\nfeel.\u201d\n\nLeah founded TaskRabbit just a few months before the global financial crisis\nthat began in 2008; and she oversaw several rounds of layoffs before her\ncompany was acquired by IKEA.\n\nThe year 2014 sticks with her. The economy was improving, but TaskRabbit faced\nan uncertain future. Customers were shifting toward mobile technology and\ncompetition for the platform was intensifying.\n\n#### Further Reading\n\n  * ![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/03/coronavirus_cover.png)\n\n###### [Coronavirus + Business: The Insights You Need from\nHBR](https://store.hbr.org/product/coronavirus-and-business-the-insights-you-\nneed-from-harvard-business-review/10440?sku=10440E-KND-ENG?referral=02560)\n\nLeadership & Managing People FREE EBOOK\n\nAdd to Cart\n\n    * __Save\n    * __Share\n\nLeah realized she couldn\u2019t hold on to the company that she had worked so hard\nto build unless she made big changes. After many agonizing conversations with\nthe company\u2019s five-member executive team, Leah came to the conclusion that she\nneeded to eliminate 20 employees, about 25% of the workforce.\n\n\u201cI knew it was best for the company in the long run, but at the time I was\nliving my worst nightmare,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was letting people down.\u201d\n\nBut Leah understood that these layoffs were not about her. \u201cHowever difficult\nit was for the team and I to make the decision, I knew it was going to be more\ndifficult for the people I had to let go.\u201d\n\nHer first order of business was to craft a message to the affected employees\nthat was short and succinct. She said something like, \u201cWe are not on a\nsustainable path. In order for the company to be healthy and move forward, we\nneed to reorganize the team and unfortunately not everyone can stay.\u201d\n\nLeah met with each employee individually and offered compassionate support,\nincluding a generous severance package. She also worked her network to help\ndeparting employees find new job opportunities. \u201cI wanted to take care of\nthese people so they could make a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nAfter, she talked with her remaining team members and offered to answer any\nquestions. \u201cAt the end of that day, we had a companywide meeting where people\ngot up and said what was on their minds. Some said, \u2018I feel sad,\u2019 or \u2018I feel\nangry,\u2019 or \u2018I feel disappointed.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy to hear those things, Leah admits. \u201cMy job was to absorb it,\u201d\nshe says. \u201cAnd I felt like a failure.\u201d\n\nPreserving her own mental health and resilience was a challenge. She recalls\nventing to her executive team. The camaraderie helped. \u201cWe were all in the\ntrenches together.\u201d\n\nToday Leah invests in startups as a VC at Fuel Capital. Lately, she has been\noffering guidance to companies as they face similar challenges. \u201cThere\u2019s no\nway around it: layoffs are hard,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was the most difficult thing I\nhad to do.\u201d ** **\n\n### **Case Study #2: Offer compassionate support and express gratitude**\n\nAs a longtime veteran of the HR industry, Carla Yudhishthu has overseen\nseveral corporate downsizings over the course of her career. It never gets\neasier. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to be as honest as you can and treat people with\ndignity, but you have to manage your own emotions and your own fears, too,\u201d\nsays Carla.\n\nShe remembers a round of layoffs early in her career that was particularly\ndifficult. The year was 2003. She was working for a publicly held medical\ndevice business in the Bay Area that had already underwent a round of layoffs\nin 2001.\n\n\u201cWe hoped we would only have to do it once, but the company was facing a lot\nof problems and we needed to have multiple iterations,\u201d she says.\n\nAs an HR manager, Carla was tasked with laying off dozens of employees \u2014\nincluding several people on her team. \u201cI had to tell my colleague who was 20\nyears older than me and had a family that he no longer had a job,\u201d she says.\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Who am I do to this? Will I be ok?\u2019\u201d\n\nCarla remembers [practicing what she would say](/2015/06/how-to-tell-someone-\ntheyre-being-laid-off). \u201cYou need to get through the pragmatic details,\u201d she\nsays. \u201cBut it\u2019s emotional and when someone reacts emotionally you can lose\ntrack of what you have to say.\u201d\n\nCarla says she approached the layoffs with humility and honesty. She also\nwanted to offer as much help and support as she could. Before breaking the\nnews, she and her colleagues gathered information on to how to access\nunemployment and the limitations on COBRA benefits. \u201cWe put a lot of thought\ninto what the message should be,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we tried to anticipate any\nquestions that people might have.\u201d\n\nShe received reassurance from her unit\u2019s leadership that her job was safe. But\nher cortisol levels remained high. To cope, she compartmentalized the task at\nhand. \u201cFrom 7:30AM to 5:30PM, I needed to think about the organization; I\ncould worry about myself after that,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI remember doing lots of deep breathing, and lots of running and yoga.\u201d\n\nCommunicating the news to the remaining employees was another challenge. She\nand her colleagues in HR were transparent. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t make promises because\nwe knew our company needed get out of the woods,\u201d she says. \u201cWe wanted to give\neveryone confidence that everything was going to be ok. But we couldn\u2019t. No\none was secure.\u201d\n\nThat company eventually closed and today Carla is the VP of People Operations\nat Mammoth HR and ThinkHR. Her advice for managers overseeing layoffs today:\n\u201cTry to create a personal connection.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrite your employees a thank you note to express your gratitude and\nappreciation and say goodbye,\u201d she says. \u201cAt a time [like this], it\u2019s a\ngesture that will be remembered.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n[Rebecca Knight](/search?term=rebecca%20knight&search_type=search-all) is a\nfreelance journalist in Boston and a lecturer at Wesleyan University.

 The best conferencing tech for working from home\n\nIn the midst of this COVID-19 pandemic, we look at the best conferencing tech\nfor working from home ![The best conferencing tech for working from home\nimage](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/best-conferencing-\ntech-for-working-from-home-840x440.jpeg)\n\nThis kind of tech will be needed more than ever.\n\nEven before offices began sending employees home, digital nomads, as well as\nemployees working remotely on occasion, have been increasingly common, using\nconferencing tech to communicate with colleagues.\n\nWith this in mind, we look at some conferencing platforms that are on the\nmarket currently, and the benefits they offer self-isolating employees.\n\n### Microsoft Teams\n\nOne of the many prominent conferencing platforms is [Microsoft\nTeams](http://teams.microsoft.com), which offers video and audio calls, as\nwell as chatroom capabilities between two people as well as groups.\n\nCalls can be recorded, and documents can be shared over chat.\n\nThe platform recently announced the possibility of coexistence and\ninteroperability with Skype for Business.\n\n> To ensure everyone can stay connected and productive, the free version of\n> [@MicrosoftTeams](https://twitter.com/MicrosoftTeams?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> now supports an unlimited number of users. Find out more:\n> <https://t.co/Bt969Io7oW>\n>\n> \u2014 Microsoft 365 (@Microsoft365) [March 18,\n> 2020](https://twitter.com/Microsoft365/status/1240291873098543104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n### Zoom\n\n[Zoom](http://zoom.us) is a video conferencing provider that also offers\nwebinar and chat capabilities.\n\nOne benefit that Zoom offers that isn't the case for other competitors is that\ncalls can be entered just with a link, without needing to install the\nprogramme or create an account.\n\n> Looking for help and guidance during these critical and uncertain times?\n> We've put together a few resources we hope will be helpful >>\n> <https://t.co/ahFet4Vv5W> Also, for those of you offering help to those\n> transitioning to online virtual formats, pls tag w/\n> [#ZoomerHelp](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZoomerHelp?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n> [pic.twitter.com/KagYKZCDfq](https://t.co/KagYKZCDfq)\n>\n> \u2014 Zoom (@zoom_us) [March 17,\n> 2020](https://twitter.com/zoom_us/status/1240043933050089473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\n\n### Cisco Webex\n\nCisco's offering to conferencing, [Cisco Webex](http://www.webex.com), allows\nfor video conferencing with possible integration of other applications, such\nas Outlook, Google Drive and Salesforce.\n\nThe platform has seen seven times more usage recently, and chief technologist\nat [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com), [Chintan\nPatel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chintancsco/), said: \"While there is no\nreplacement for meeting face-to-face and being in the same room as a colleague\nor customer, video meetings are proven to be more effective than voice calls.\n\n\"In fact, 93% of employees say video calls improve interactions and client\nrelationships.\"\n\n> #### ![](https://s27389.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/hr-technology-\n> priority-hr-professionals-150x150.jpg)Integrating HR technology now a top\n> priority for HR professionals\n>\n> [According to new research, 89% of HR professionals say that integrating HR\n> technology is a top priority for 2019. Read here](/hr-technology-priority-\n> hr-professionals-123481182/)\n\n### Google Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat\n\nGoogle brings two main offerings to the conferencing tech space: [Google\nHangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) Meet and Google Hangouts Chat.\n\nBoth are available under the G-Suite banner, and while Hangouts Meet offers\nvideo conferencing for up to 50 participants for enterprises, Hangouts Chat is\nfor online conversations and sharing documents with colleagues.\n\n> We want to help businesses and people who are now working remotely during\n> this challenging time.

Desk](https://www.cxotoday.com/author/cxonewsdesk/) __5 hours ago\n\n![](https://www.cxotoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/remote-working10.jpg)\n\n ** _By Joe Berger_**\n\nFor years, large enterprises have been seeing the rise of the remote worker.\nHowever, the impact of COVID-19 shows that it\u2019s now a critical business-\ncontinuity factor that any knowledge worker \u2014 regardless of age, work-life\npreference or company position \u2014 can do his or her job from home successfully.\n\nSo, how do large enterprises rapidly enable groups of knowledge workers who\nmust suddenly transition from office life to remote work?\n\nBy exploring four essential pillars of remote work \u2014 meetings, collaboration\ntools, application access and calling \u2014 we can begin to answer this question.\n\n**Meetings**\n\nLet\u2019s start with meetings, because they can\u2019t come to a halt during a global\ncrisis. In fact, they will spike.\n\nI learned this at the start of my career, one month after 9/11, when I was\nworking for a large conferencing provider. September 12, 2001, marked the\nlargest call volume in history at that time as organizations tried to untangle\nthe impact of the crisis to their business. Since then, I\u2019ve seen conferencing\nsoar following outbreaks of SARS and MERS as well as the Great Recession.\n\nThe coronavirus is no different. Amid the outbreak, Cisco reported that WebEx\nmeeting minutes shot up to 14 billion in March. More than 26 million people\nhosted WebEx meetings last month, and the platform had 10 million new users..\nSimilarly, video conferencing competitor Zoom has added more active users so\nfar this year than it did in all of 2019.\n\nNot only do remote employees suddenly need to be in a lot of meetings, but I\nbelieve that enabling video for these meetings is one of the best ways we can\nconnect on a personal level when personal contact is restricted.\n\n**Implementation tips**\n\n  * Encourage use of existing enterprise video conferencing investments.\n  * Discourage departments from purchasing video conferencing solutions on corporate credit cards.\n  * Take advantage of enterprise-scale vendors like WebEx and Zoom that are lifting restrictions on free versions of their products, and in the case of [WebEx, offering free 90-day licenses.](https://www.wwt.com/cisco-webex-wwt-free-trial)\n  * Invest in end-user adoption and training. You can buy meeting licenses, but if remote workers don\u2019t know how to access features, they can easily become frustrated and disengaged from your video conferencing platform.\n\n**Team collaboration tools**\n\nKnowledge workers, as their name implies, rely on sharing knowledge to get\ntheir jobs done. As employees have shifted to working from home full time, the\ninability to turn to a colleague for advice or to bounce ideas back and forth\ncan be isolating.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to give employees a team collaboration platform in which they\ncan share their knowledge and collaborate as seamlessly as possible. In\naddition, the shift from the individual worker to the \u201cteam of teams\u201d model\nhas increased the need for connected groups to constantly communicate and\nshare content in real time.\n\nFront runners in this space for large enterprises are Microsoft Teams, Slack\nand Cisco WebEx Teams. Like Cisco, Microsoft is trying to make it easier for\nthose impacted by the coronavirus to use Teams. The company is offering a free\nsix-month trial of a premium tier of the platform and expanding the\ncapabilities of its free version.\n\nManagers, not just individual contributors, are being asked to stay home. The\npersistent nature of these platforms not only helps teammates share ideas, but\nthey also make it easy for managers to keep tabs on what their teams are\nworking on and jump in to help when needed.\n\n**Implementation tips**\n\n  * Leverage enterprise buying agreements for the most cost-effective models.\n  * Understand your organization\u2019s security posture to avoid risk or data loss.\n  * Discourage small teams from using free versions of software through personal accounts.\n  * Educate employees on how to use new tools and tap into existing expertise. Chances are groups of employees have already embraced these tools. Allow them to coach peers who are just getting started.\n  * Reduce the number of tools to limit confusion.\n  * Understand how these tools act both in and outside of your organization. Some tools may not be as good as others when interacting with those outside of your business.\n\n**Access to corporate applications**\n\nIT organizations spend considerable time and money ensuring that corporate\napplication performance doesn\u2019t suffer when planning for disaster recovery.\nBut how much does that matter when, in our current situation, remote workers\nare unable to access these apps?\n\nApplication and desktop virtualization solutions like VMware Workspace One can\ntake the strain out of remote device management and compliance. These\nsolutions can be hosted on-premises, in a public cloud or a combination of\nboth, providing high-performance user experiences without the need for full-\ndevice VPN connections.\n\nGiving staff the ability to manage devices over untrusted or trusted networks\nof varying bandwidth can save IT tremendous time and cost.\n\n**Implementation tips**\n\n  * If your IT organization currently has application and desktop virtualization, evaluate your licensing to determine if you\u2019re prepared.\n  * Consider expanding existing remote access use cases. Can you virtualize any additional applications or access to desktops?\n  * Be prepared for increased circuit network bandwidth use.\n  * Investigate solutions that can be spun up and expanded quickly, particularly cloud-based or hybrid solutions.\n  * Educate your employees on how to access applications.\n\n**Calling**\n\nWhen we talk about enabling the remote worker outside of the context of a\ncrisis situation, calling isn\u2019t usually top of mind. But in the case of\nmaintaining business continuity, calling becomes essential.\n\nThe coronavirus is forcing all types of remote workers to stay at home,\nincluding positions in finance, HR and call centers that rely heavily on\noffice phone systems. If large enterprises can\u2019t provide remote employees\naccess to their phone systems, they risk losing market share, hitting numbers\nand distancing customers. Luckily, vendors like Cisco and Microsoft offer\nvarious solutions for cloud calling that give remote users the same benefits\nof an on-premise PBX phone system. Not only that, but phone systems hosted in\nthe cloud can be easier to get up and running than you may think.\n\n**Implementation tips**\n\n  * Prioritize call forwarding.\n  * Prioritize single number reach.\n  * Enable users for mobile remote access.\n  * Provide tools such as headsets and web cams for improved voice and video.\n\n**Ensuring remote business continuity**\n\nBy delivering remote workers [powerful calling, a rich meeting experience,\nteam collaboration, and the ability to easily work from any\ndevice](https://www.wwt.com/topic/remote-working#all), employers can not only\nkeep workers safe during the coronavirus, but also reassured from a business\ncontinuity standpoint.\n\nTechnology gives us the ability to bring nearly all the benefits of office\nlife outside of the office. However, developing sudden solutions for a remote\nwork experience is challenging. The good news is that with the [right tools\nand resources](https://www.wwt.com/category/digital-workspace#lab), the right\napproach can further a large enterprise\u2019s overall vision for collaboration and\nimprove the lives of knowledge workers beyond when a crisis ends.\n\n![](https://www.cxotoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/joe-berger.jpg)\n\n_(The author is senior director,

There's just one problem: We're still figuring\nout how to properly, and professionally, communicate via IM. Organizations\nshould begin to adopt best practices, such as carefully choosing which systems\nto use, ideally ones already favored by employees; setting ground rules around\npersonal messages; respecting work-life balance by creating norms around\nappropriate response times; and encouraging face-to-face communication as\nwell.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/03/Mar20_10_118886894-1024x576.jpg)\nchestnutphoto/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/03/best-practices-for-instant-messaging-at-\nwork?language=es)\n\nWe\u2019ve made our [coronavirus coverage](/insight-\ncenter/coronavirus?ab=articlewidget-insightcenter-coronavirus) free for all\nreaders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll Slack you.\u201d In workplaces around the world, the name of the popular\nonline messaging system has become a verb, just like Google. Slack has been\nenthusiastically integrated into the day-to-day functions of legacy\ncorporations and burgeoning startups: The company claims that, in 2019, it\nhosted [10+ million daily users](https://slackhq.com/slack-has-10-million-\ndaily-active-users). It has competitors, too, including Microsoft Teams and\nZoom.\n\nThe benefits of these tools have quickly become obvious. [Even in the early\n2000s](https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/4/JCMC10413/4614475),\nresearchers noted how instant messaging helped to decrease needless, back-and-\nforth phone calls and alleviate miscommunications. And [instant messaging\ntrounces email](/2016/02/a-modest-proposal-eliminate-email) by offering\nimmediate and clearer resolution to business concerns that may have lingered\nunnoticed in inboxes.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: We\u2019re still figuring out how to properly, and\nprofessionally, communicate via IM. These systems can create communication\nsilos, where teams who are highly integrated in one platform are unable to\ncollaborate with departments rooted in another. Ease of communication also\nbreeds distraction and informality, where instant messaging becomes a natural\nconduit to share non-work related information, including details, sometimes\ninappropriate, of workers\u2019 personal lives. And it\u2019s no surprise that IM [has\ncreated legal snafus](https://www.wyrick.com/news-insights/the-dark-side-of-\ninstant-messaging-for-business) for organizations; instant messages discussing\npotential litigation can, ironically, be used in those lawsuits.\n\nNone of these issues are insurmountable. But they remain a struggle, which\nindicates that companies haven\u2019t quite cracked how to design and implement\npolicies that properly guide and govern workplace instant messaging.\n\nHow a given workplace chooses to use IM, if at all, is up to them, but with\nSlack and Teams becoming the norm within most organizations, here are some\nsuggested best practices.\n\n### **1\\. Adopt the tools your employees are already using.**\n\nPopular instant messaging dates back to the early 2000s, and Slack, in\nparticular, has been gaining traction for years.  Rather than starting from\nscratch with a workplace IM system, companies should build upon what employees\nalready know and like. This includes identifying which ones people are\ncurrently using; selecting one that is both popular and suited to your\norganization; modifying it to fit your needs; creating policies for\nappropriate use, archiving, and safekeeping; educating managers on use and\nrisk factors; training HR reps; and regularly readdressing processes and\nprocedures to improve.\n\nFor example, at a small tech startup, many team members may already use\nFacebook Messenger as a means of socializing, both on and offsite. That\nplatform itself doesn\u2019t have to become the official IM standard for the\ncompany, but it can be integrated into a larger messaging system.\n\n### **2\\. Embrace all kinds of instant messaging \u2013 but set ground rules.**\n\nSlack and Teams can be distracting, especially when they\u2019re used as an online\nemployee repository for GIFs, jokes, and debates over sports games and TV plot\nlines. They can also be unintended outlets for bullying, abuse, and\nharassment, where group messages are shared about a coworker\u2019s outfit,\nmannerisms, or sex life, despite that colleague sitting only two desks away.\n\nBut there are benefits to workers messaging about non-business topics, too.\nThese digital interactions create camaraderie, and people are [less likely to\nleave their jobs](https://tech.co/news/inspired-employees-more-\nproductive-2016-04) when they have friends at the office. Liking your\ncolleagues has also shown to [increase engagement by 700%](/2017/08/having-\nwork-friends-can-be-tricky-but-its-worth-it).\n\nTo reap the social benefits of these tools, while minimizing the risks of\nemployee distraction or diminished mental health, organizations should clearly\ndefine expectations for personal messaging. These should be immediately\ndesigned and delivered to current staff and introduced to new hires during\nonboarding. They should also be carefully reiterated over time. And HR teams\nshould be trained on protocols for addressing complaints and concerns.\n\n### **3\\. Respect work/life balance.**\n\nInstant messaging systems allows us to reach out to colleagues, reports, and\nbosses at any time \u2014 in a way that might seem more urgent than email. Unless\nthe communication is extremely time-sensitive, resist this urge. Most messages\ncan easily wait until the next business day.\n\nYou might justify the behavior by saying that the issue is top of mind for\nyou, you don\u2019t want to forget, and you don\u2019t expect the recipient to respond\nright away. But the person who is pinged might project a sense of urgency onto\nthe message and feel obligated to get back to you, even if it cuts into their\nown personal time.\n\nOne way for an organization to get around this is by encouraging people to\nsign off IM tools and to [respect others\u2019 out-of-office status\nmessage](https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/boost-productivity-chat-\npresence/) _s_. Explain to everyone that any requests made to colleagues\nshould come with information about when answers are needed, and that most\nconversations should happen during the workday and kept short and to the\npoint.\n\n### **4\\. Promote face-to-face communication, too.**\n\nDigital messages aren\u2019t always easy to interpret. A boss who says, \u201cI think\nyou can do better\u201d in person can be either motivational or discouraging,\ndepending on whether the comment is delivered with a smile or disapproving\nglare, with outstretched hands or closed arms. If you get the same message on\nSlack, it\u2019s harder to read \u2014 unless you regularly interact with that manager\nin person.\n\nSo, even if your workplace is mostly remote, it\u2019s important to ensure that\nsome sort of face-to-face communication happens: one-on-one meetings, teams\nand department get-togethers, onsite introductions and seminars. Even video\nconference calls can help.\n\nAnd, even as you encourage online socializing, make sure it happens in the\nreal world, too; consider company picnics, social lunches, and community\nvolunteer days.\n\nIf you follow these protocols, any IM platform will remain a beneficial\nworkplace tool rather than a nuisance.\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/03/110-Dustin-York.jpg)\n\n[Dustin York ](https://online.maryville.edu/business-degrees/faculty/dustin-\nyork/)is an associate professor and the director of undergraduate and graduate\ncommunications at [Maryville\nUniversity.](https://online.maryville.edu/business-degrees)\n\n* * *\n\n###### This article is about [LEADING TEAMS](/topic/leading-teams)\n\n__Follow this topic\n\n__Following\n\nRelated Topics:\n\n  * [Personnel policies](/topic/personnel-policies)\n  * [Communication](/topic/communication)\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\n#### Partner Center\n\n[Coronavirus](/insight-center/coronavirus) [Magazine](/magazine)\n[Popular](/most-popular) [Topics](/topics) [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n[Video](/video) [Store](/store) [The Big Idea](/big-ideas) [Visual\nLibrary](/visual-library) [Reading Lists](/reading-lists) [Case\nSelections](/case-selections)\n\n[![Harvard Business Review Home](/resources/css/images/hbr_logo.svg)](/)\n\n[**Subscribe**](/subscribe)\n\n###### Explore HBR\n\n  * [The Latest](/the-latest)\n  * [Most Popular](/most-popular)\n  * [All Topics](/topics)\n  * [Magazine Archive](/magazine)\n  * [The Big Idea](/big-ideas)\n  * [Reading Lists](/reading-lists)\n  * [Case Selections](/case-selections)\n  * [Video](/video)\n  * [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n  * [Webinars](/webinars)\n  * [Visual Library](/visual-library)\n  * [My Library](/my-library)\n  * [Newsletters](/email-newsletters)\n  * [HBR Ascend](https://hbrascend.org/)\n\n###### HBR Store\n\n  * [Article Reprints](/store/articles)\n  * [Books](/store/books)\n  * [Cases](/store/case-studies)\n  * [Collections](/store/collections)\n  * [Magazine Issues](/store/magazine-issues)\n  * [HBR Guide Series](/store/landing/guides)\n  * [HBR 20-Minute Managers](/store/landing/20-minute-managers)\n  * [HBR Emotional Intelligence Series](/store/landing/emotional-intelligence-series)\n  * [HBR Must Reads](/store/landing/mustreads)\n  * [Tools](/store/tools)\n\n###### About HBR\n\n  * [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n  * [Advertise with Us](/hbr-advertising-sales)\n  * [Information for Booksellers/Retailers](/booksellers-retailers)\n  * [Masthead](/about-hbr)\n  * [Global Editions](/global-editions)\n  * [Media Inquiries](/media-inquiries)\n  * [Guidelines for Authors](/guidelines-for-authors-web)\n  * [HBR Analytic Services](/hbr-analytic-services)\n\n###### HBR Subscriber Assistance\n\n  * [Subscribe](/subscribe)\n  * [Subscriber Help](/subscriber-help)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.274.3214](tel:+18002743214)  \n[harvard@cdsfulfillment.com](mailto:harvard@cdsfulfillment.com)  \n[hbr.org/subscriberservices](/subscriberservices)\n\n  * International:  \n[+44.1858.438.412](tel:+441858438412)  \n[(Asia Pacific: +61.2.9158.6127)](tel:+61291586127)  \n[hbr@subscription.co.uk](mailto:hbr@subscription.co.uk)  \n[subscription.co.uk/hbr/help](https://www.subscription.co.uk/hbr/help)\n\n###### HBR.ORG Customer Assistance\n\n  * [Help Center](/help-customer-service-home)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.988.0886](tel:+18009880886)\n\n  *   * International:  \n[617.783.7500](tel:+16177837500)\n\n  * Email:  \n[customerservice@harvardbusiness.org](mailto:customerservice@harvardbusiness.org)\n\n  * [Copyright Permissions](/permissions)\n\n###### Follow HBR\n\n  * __[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/HBR)\n  * __[Twitter](http://twitter.com/HarvardBiz)\n  * __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review?trk=biz-companies-cym)\n  * __[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harvard_business_review/?hl=en)\n  * __[Your Newsreader](http://feeds.hbr.org/harvardbusiness/)\n\n![Harvard Business Publishing](/resources/images/2018/new_logo_May11.png)\n\n  * [About Us](/corporate/about)\n  * [Careers](/corporate/careers)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n  * [Copyright Information](/corporate/copyright)\n  * [Trademark Policy](http://trademark.harvard.edu/pages/trademark-notice)\n\n  \n\nHarvard Business Publishing:\n\n  * [Higher Education](http://hbsp.harvard.edu/)\n  * [Corporate Learning](http://www.harvardbusiness.org)\n  * [Harvard Business Review](http://hbr.org/)\n  * [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Harvard Business School Publishing.

To\nimprove the connection of remote team members, companies rely on video\nconference tools. This is even more applicable today, as the coronavirus\npandemic has gripped the world and made the video conference a vital part of\neveryday business operations.\n\nMel Panabi, vice president for marketing for WeGen Distributed Energy\nPhilippines, a renewable energy company, says that for his team, video\nconferencing extends beyond monitoring. \"Video calls actually help in keeping\nthe bond of the team and lifts team morale since you will feel isolated when\nyou work from home,\" he says. \"Video calls or chats allow us to re-create the\ngroup dynamics that you experience during team meetings in the office.\"\n\nYou may also like:\n\n  * [Ely Buendia just lent his classic song for this video that will make you smile behind your masks](https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/culture/spotlight/04/04/20/ely-buendia-just-lent-his-classic-song-for-this-video-that-will-make-you-smile-behind-your-masks)\n  * [The survival story of Patient 480: \"You can't fight this battle alone\"](https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/culture/spotlight/04/04/20/the-survival-story-of-patient-480-you-cant-fight-this-battle-alone)\n  * [Voices from the frontline: A day in the life of PGH's Dr. Brian Cabral](https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/culture/spotlight/video/04/04/20/voices-from-the-frontline-a-day-in-the-life-of-pghs-dr-brian-cabral)\n  * [How this mayor turned Iloilo into a model city with its \"all action\" approach to fight COVID-1](https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/culture/spotlight/04/03/20/in-iloilo-city-frontliners-are-first-priority)\n  * [This frontliner shares the lonely nature of COVID-19 care and deaths](https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/culture/spotlight/03/30/20/this-frontliner-shares-the-lonely-nature-of-covid-19-care-and-deaths)\n\nVince Sales, regional head for branded content for Tickled Media, says, his\nteam is composed of members from all over the region and, as such, were\nalready doing regular calls even before the pandemic. \"It helps to make\neveryone feel a little less isolated, and--for team members outside the\nPhilippines--put faces to names.\"\n\nBecause a video conference will usually take place at your home, which is not\na work place, there are additional expectations you should be aware of when\nyou answer a video call. Here are the dos and don'ts of video conferencing.\n\n\n\n### 1\\. Do use the right tools that will fully engage remote participants\n\nBefore you attend a video conference, make sure you're fully equipped with the\nright technology. You can choose from easy-to-use and reliable apps like\nSlack, Google Hangouts, and Microsoft Teams. Your team manager will dictate\nthe main communication platform, but you can also help things by upgrading\nyour simple webcam setup. Check if your laptop or mobile phone camera,\nmicrophone, and speaker are utilizing smart technology so that you can hear\nand be heard well and also look good to your team members. \"Use a headset,\"\nSales recommends. \"It solves many common video call problems like feedback,\nbad sound, and echoes.\"\n\n\n\n### 2\\. Do check if your technology works correctly\n\nBefore your video call, make sure your system is working properly. Finance and\nHR director Dokes Nilo suggests testing your video, audio, and bandwidth.\n\"Install the software beforehand and test with someone else so that no actual\nmeeting time is lost due to such setup and technical issues,\" he says.\n\n\n\n### 3\\. Don't hold it in a dark room\n\nLaptop cameras are not exactly good at making you look your best so you'll\nneed to set up your environment. Poor lighting conditions can affect how your\nteam views you, literally and figuratively. So be sure there's enough light in\nthe room to make your face clear and visible. Daylight is best but if your\nglobal team is holding a meeting that's night time for you, turn on all the\nlights. \"Choose a nice spot to make your call from,\" Sales says. \"A well-lit\nplace clear of clutter is ideal. And it makes a good impression!\"\n\n\n\n### 4\\. Do get your household to cooperate\n\nBe aware of your background. Your team mates will be seeing part of your home\nso check that there's no mess, laundry, or too-personal effects like sex toys,\nor your wife's lingerie visible. \"Don't attend a video conference in a place\nwhere your officemates can see people inside your house mingling behind you,\"\nPanabi recommends. \"Please tell the people inside your house that you are in a\nmeeting so they should be quiet. I've attended a meeting where we could hear\nsomeone in the background talking about what they will cook for lunch and it\nwas so disconcerting.\"\n\n![](https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/ancx/culture/2020/18/1vid.jpg)\nSince the lockdown, video conference tool Zoom has become a popular choice.\nPhotograph from official website of Zoom\n\n### 5\\. Do wear work-appropriate attire\n\nYou may be at home but don't forget you're working. Even if you don't have a\nvideo conference scheduled, wear something professional anyway since your boss\nmight suddenly do a video call and you'll have to rush to grab a shirt and\ncomb your hair. \"Wear pants!\" Sales warns. \"You may need to get up during the\ncall.\"\n\n\n\n### 6\\. Don't be late\n\nGet ready even before the meeting starts. As mentioned, make sure everything's\nworking properly and you're dressed so that you're professionally prepared\nwhen the call comes in. Ditto Mendoza, PR and digital manager for a telco,\nsays that everyone should respect the schedule. \"Just because you're home, it\ndoesn't mean you can just chime in whenever you want, or that organizers can\njust let the conversation continue without any restrictions.\"\n\n\n\n### 7\\. Don't position the camera too low\n\nYou don't want your team to look up your nostrils and see your nose hair so\nframe your camera at eye level. A camera set too low makes for unflattering\nlooks like double chins and a sinister scowl. Placing it too high, however,\nmakes you look small. Too near and your face takes up the whole screen. Set it\nup so that your face and upper midsection are visible.\n\n\n\n### 8\\. Do look into the camera\n\nIt's natural for us to look at ourselves when we're speaking but it actually\nmakes you look like you're not engaged with the people you're talking to. Look\nat the camera lens so that you'll appear like you're looking into the person's\neyes.\n\n\n\n### 9\\. Do mute your mic when not speaking\n\nMost microphones can pick up background noise so even though you think you're\nbeing quiet, your team can hear you typing. Other noise at home like sneezes,\nkids playing, or the vacuum can be distracting and even annoying.\n\nTo avoid this from happening, Nilo says that during the vidcon, \"participants\nshould mute their mic for the majority of the meeting, unless requested to\nspeak.\"\n\nPanabi says, \"I've attended meetings where there are 4 or 5 microphones on and\nthe different sounds can really distract you.\" Nilo adds, \"Participants should\nalso consider turning off their video, if agreed upon, to minimize bandwidth\nrequirements for those who have slower connections.\"\n\n\n\n### 10\\. Do be professional\n\nDon't let your home setup lull you into a casual mood. Mendoza says it's okay\nto check on each other but don't forget why you're meeting in the first place.\n\"Follow the agenda! Tackle things line by line but also allot some time for\nsmall talk and bonding,\" he says.\n\nYou should also pay attention to the meeting. Your team may not see what\nyou're doing off camera but this is not the time to multitask. Stop checking\nemails or typing up your report! \"Listen and be prepared. I can't stress this\nenough,\" Panabi says. Some people think that since they're not physically\nthere they can fidget or do something else while someone is talking. As a\nmatter of professional courtesy and to make the meeting truly productive, you\nneed to give your full attention to the meeting. If you need to present\nsomething, make sure that you come fully prepared. It's a sign that you're a\ntrue professional in and out of the office.\"\n\nShare these 10 dos and don'ts for video conferencing with your colleagues so\nyou can all avoid committing a major faux pas at the next big meeting.\n\n  * /ancx/culture/spotlight/04/08/20/living-through-the-lockdown-alone-here-are-some-mental-health-checks\n  * /ancx/food-drink/features/04/07/20/this-holy-week-here-are-the-metro-manila-restaurants-that-will-remain-open\n  * /ancx/drive/sports/04/07/20/how-daily-yoga-and-meditation-can-strengthen-the-immune-system\n  * /ancx/culture/spotlight/04/07/20/our-real-gains-from-the-lockdown-and-what-must-be-done-before-govt-should-end-it\n  * /ancx/culture/spotlight/04/07/20/the-street-where-i-lived-lets-call-it-the-good-place\n\n[next]()\n\n(C) 2020 ABS-CBN Corporation.

I\u2019m getting plenty of work done, but I\u2019m starting to get unnerved by\nthe lack of stimulation. It\u2019s been hours (days?) since I interacted face to\nface with a human who is not related to me, and cabin fever is setting in.\n\nAmong the coronavirus\u2019s many effects is a boom in people like me: office\nworkers, shooed away from the office, trying to acclimate to a work-from-home\nlifestyle.\n\nWhile the outbreak has already created inconveniences (and much worse) for\nmillions of people in the form of travel restrictions, health scares and\n[stock market turmoil](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/business/stock-\nmarket-today.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage), it has been\nan exciting time for some fans of remote work. They argue that quarantined\nworkers are getting a glimpse of our glorious, office-free future.\n\n\u201cThis is not how I envisioned the distributed work revolution taking hold,\u201d\n[wrote Matt Mullenweg](https://ma.tt/2020/03/coronavirus-remote-work/), chief\nexecutive of Automattic, the software company that owns the WordPress blogging\nplatform.\n\nMr. Mullenweg, whose company\u2019s work force is fully distributed, sees a silver\nlining in the coronavirus. In his blog post last week, he wrote that it \u201cmight\nalso offer an opportunity for many companies to finally build a culture that\nallows long-overdue work flexibility.\u201d\n\nI get where he\u2019s coming from. I was a remote worker for two years a while\nback. For most of that time, I was a work-from-home evangelist who told\neveryone within earshot about the benefits of avoiding the office. No commute!\nNo distracting co-workers! Home-cooked lunch! What\u2019s not to love?\n\nBut I\u2019ve been researching the pros and cons of remote work for my upcoming\n[book](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/617763/futureproof-by-kevin-\nroose/) about human survival in the age of artificial intelligence and\nautomation. And I\u2019ve now come to a very different conclusion: Most people\nshould work in an office, or near other people, and avoid solitary work-from-\nhome arrangements whenever possible.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: Working from home is a good option for new parents, people\nwith disabilities and others who aren\u2019t well served by a traditional office\nsetup. I don\u2019t think we should ignore health guidelines and force people to\nwork in an office during a pandemic. And I\u2019m sympathetic to the millions of\nteachers, restaurant workers and other professionals for whom working from\nhome has never been a viable option.\n\nBut for those of us lucky enough to be able to work from home, coronavirus or\nno, a few words of caution are in order.\n\nFans of remote work often cite studies showing that people who work from home\nare more productive, like a [2014\nstudy](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/130/1/165/2337855) led by the\nStanford professor Nicholas Bloom. The study examined remote workers at a\nChinese travel agency and found that they were 13 percent more efficient than\ntheir office-based peers.\n\nBut research also shows that what remote workers gain in productivity, they\noften miss in harder-to-measure benefits like creativity and innovative\nthinking. Studies have found that people working together in the same room\ntend to solve problems more quickly than remote collaborators, and that [team\ncohesion suffers](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/11/when-\nworking-from-home-doesnt-work/540660/) in remote work arrangements.\n\nRemote workers also tend to take shorter breaks and fewer sick days than\noffice-based ones, and in studies, [many report finding it hard\n](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273761672_Work-\nLife_Balance_and_Working_from_Home)to separate their work from their home\nlives. That\u2019s a good thing if you\u2019re a boss looking to squeeze extra\nefficiency out of your employees, but less ideal if you\u2019re someone trying to\nachieve some work-life balance.\n\nWorking in isolation can be lonely, which explains the popularity of co-\nworking spaces like WeWork and The Wing. Even in Silicon Valley, where the\ntools that allow for remote work are being built, many companies are strict\nabout requiring their workers to come into the office.\n\nSteve Jobs, for one, was a famous opponent of remote work, believing that\nApple employees\u2019 best work came from accidentally bumping into other people,\nnot sitting at home in front of an email inbox.\n\n\u201cCreativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions,\u201d Mr.\nJobs said. \u201cYou run into someone, you ask what they\u2019re doing, you say \u2018Wow,\u2019\nand soon you\u2019re cooking up all sorts of ideas.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll grant that office work has its downsides, even in healthy times.\nCommuting has been shown to make us less happy, and the open-plan office, a\n[truly cursed workplace design\ntrend](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/opinion/wework-adam-neumann.html)\nthat emphasizes airy spaces with rows of desks and little privacy, has made\ndistraction-free focus nearly impossible.\n\nBut being near other people also allows us to express our most human\nqualities, like empathy and collaboration. Those are the skills that can\u2019t be\nautomated. And they\u2019re what produces the kind of meaningful interpersonal\ncontact we miss out on when we\u2019re stuck at home.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an element of social interaction that\u2019s really important,\u201d said\nLaszlo Bock, the chief executive of\n[Humu](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/technology/human-resources-\nartificial-intelligence-humu.html), a Silicon Valley human resources start-up.\n\nMr. Bock, who was previously Google\u2019s top human resources officer, said that\nfor most people, balancing office work with remote work is ideal. His\ncompany\u2019s research has found that the ideal amount of work-from-home time is\none and a half days per week \u2014 enough to participate in office culture, with\nsome time reserved for deep, focused work.\n\n\u201cThe reason tech companies have micro-kitchens and free snacks is not because\nthey think people are going to starve between 9 a.m. and noon,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s\nbecause that\u2019s where you get those moments of serendipity.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, some companies with sizable remote workforces have\nexperimented with ways to create office culture over a distance.\n\nAutomattic, Mr. Mullenweg\u2019s all-remote company, holds an annual weeklong staff\nretreat called the \u201cgrand meetup,\u201d at which workers gather in the same place\nto socialize and work on group projects. At GitLab, an open-source\ncollaboration platform, remote workers are [encouraged to\nschedule](https://qz.com/work/1147877/remote-work-why-we-put-virtual-coffee-\nbreaks-in-our-company-handbook/) \u201cvirtual coffee breaks\u201d \u2014 purely social video\nconferences \u2014 with colleagues they don\u2019t know well.\n\nIf the coronavirus continues preventing people from going to the office, more\ncompanies may need to try tactics like these to help keep their workers happy\nand connected.\n\nBut some people may never be content with virtual water coolers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very personal decision that works for some and doesn\u2019t work for\nothers,\u201d said Julia Austin, a former tech executive and professor at Harvard\nBusiness School. \u201cSome people are more productive and happy and find other\nways to get social contact if they work from home. And some people aren\u2019t\nhappy working alone.\u201d\n\nAs a white-collar millennial, I\u2019m supposed to be cheering on the remote work\nrevolution. But I\u2019ve realized that I can\u2019t be my best, most human self in\nsweatpants, pretending to pay attention on video conferences between trips to\nthe fridge.\n\nI\u2019ll stay home as long as my bosses and the health authorities advise. But\nhonestly, I can\u2019t wait to go back to work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nContinue reading the main story\n\n## Site Index\n\n## Site Information Navigation\n\n  * [\u00a9 2020 The New York Times Company](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014792127-Copyright-notice)\n\n  * [NYTCo](https://www.nytco.com/)\n  * [Contact Us](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115015385887-Contact-Us)\n  * [Work with us](https://www.nytco.com/careers/)\n  * [Advertise](https://nytmediakit.com/)\n  * [T Brand Studio](http://www.tbrandstudio.com/)\n  * [Your Ad Choices](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014892108-Privacy-policy)\n  * [Privacy](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014892108-Privacy-policy)\n  * [Terms of Service](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893428-Terms-of-service)\n  * [Terms of Sale](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/115014893968-Terms-of-sale)\n  * [Site Map](https://spiderbites.nytimes.com)\n  * [Help](https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us)\n  * [Subscriptions](https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=37WXW)\n  * \n\n"}, {"item": "Coronavirus pandemic puts the spotlight on mental health resources - Employee Benefit News", "link": "https://www.benefitnews.com/news/coronavirus-pandemic-puts-the-spotlight-on-mental-health-resources", "guid": "CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlbmVmaXRuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLXBhbmRlbWljLXB1dHMtdGhlLXNwb3RsaWdodC1vbi1tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLXJlc291cmNlc9IBAA", "pubdate": "Fri, 13 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.benefitnews.com/news/coronavirus-pandemic-puts-the-spotlight-on-mental-health-resources\" target=\"_blank\">Coronavirus pandemic puts the spotlight on mental health resources</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Employee Benefit News</font>", "source": "Employee Benefit News", "body": "Coronavirus pandemic puts the spotlight on mental health resources | Employee\nBenefit News\n\n  * [Retirement](https://www.benefitnews.com/retirement)\n\n  * [Wellness](https://www.benefitnews.com/wellness)\n\n  * [Voluntary](https://www.benefitnews.com/voluntary)\n\n  * [Dig|HR](https://www.benefitnews.com/dig-hr)\n\n  * [Views](https://www.benefitnews.com/opinion)\n\n  * [Employer Strategies](https://www.benefitnews.com/employer-strategies)\n\n  * More\n\n    * [Events](https://www.benefitnews.com/events)\n    * [Regulation](https://www.benefitnews.com/regulation)\n    * [Insurance](https://www.benefitnews.com/insurance)\n    * [Healthcare](https://www.benefitnews.com/healthcare)\n    * [Resources](https://www.benefitnews.com/resources)\n    * [Events](https://www.benefitnews.com/events)\n    * [Regulation](https://www.benefitnews.com/regulation)\n    * [Insurance](https://www.benefitnews.com/insurance)\n    * [Healthcare](https://www.benefitnews.com/healthcare)\n    * [Resources](https://www.benefitnews.com/resources)\n\nLogin\n\nSign Up\n\n\u00a9 2020 Arizent.

now\n\nManaging mental health in and outside of the office is a challenge for more\nthan half of Americans, but the added stressors of coronavirus are pushing\nmany people to reach out for help.\n\nAs attempts are made to quell the spread of COVID-19, companies have mandated\nemployees work remotely and have [cancelled\nconferences](https://www.benefitnews.com/news/as-coronavirus-spreads-firms-\nhit-the-brakes-on-adviser-travel), gatherings and other non-essential travel.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended implementing\n\u201csocial distancing,\u201d which involves minimizing exposure by avoiding large\ncrowds, working remotely if possible, and practicing personal hygiene like\nwashing your hands frequently.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s a stressful time, and we\u2019re seeing significant increases in\nsessions for therapy and psychiatry,\u201d says Russ Glass, CEO of\n[Ginger](https://www.ginger.io/), a virtual mental health support platform.\n\u201cThe disruption in behavior and the uncertainty has led to a lot of anxiety.\u201d\n\nThe increasing severity of the pandemic has many people on edge. The World\nHealth Organization released guidance for dealing with stress and anxiety\nassociated with coronavirus. Among their recommendations: avoid watching the\nnews and implement plans to feel prepared and safe.\n\n\u201cAvoid watching, reading or listening to news that can cause you to feel\nanxious or distressed \u2014 the sudden and near-constant stream of news reports\nabout an outbreak can cause anyone to feel worried,\u201d the WHO guidelines say.\n\nBut for those with mental health issues, balancing the demands of work with\nthis new reality can add additional stress and make work challenging.\n\n\u201cWhen people are experiencing fear, they try to exert control in whatever\nsituation they can, but the results are often destructive,\u201d says Ken\nZuckerberg, vice president of training at ComPsych, [a global EAP\nprovider](https://www.benefitnews.com/news/eap-helps-employees-with-\ncoronavirus-anxiety). \u201cEmployees are not performing their best if they\u2019re\ndealing with feelings of isolation, or fears of being quarantined.\u201d\n\nEighteen percent of Americans struggle with [mental\nillness](https://www.benefitnews.com/news/reducing-the-stigma-of-mental-\nillness-with-digital-treatment-options), and 61% of employees report their\nmental health affects their work, according to the CDC. Even in times when\nexternal stressors are not as prevalent, these issues lead to productivity\nloss and absenteeism in the workplace.\n\n\u201cPeople at work who are dealing with behavioral health issues self-report 20%\nor greater productivity loss and also develop other chronic health\nconditions,\u201d Glass says. \u201cEmployees are coming to their employer and saying,\n\u2018I need help but our current insurance plan or current EAPs aren't providing\nthe right level of access. I can't get care.\u2019\u201d\n\nNow more than ever, employers need to provide resources that address these\nmental health issues, Glass says.\n\n\u201cCompanies have to be thinking about both physical and mental health and\nrecognize that this is a very stressful time for their employees,\u201d says Glass,\nwhose mental health platform, Ginger, connects users with behavioral health\ncoaches for chat and video-based sessions. Users can seek help from therapists\nand psychiatrists through the platform. Glass says they\u2019ve reported an 16%\nincrease in session volume and a 10% increase in their daily users in the past\ntwo weeks.\n\nFor those struggling with anxiety or feelings of isolation because of\ncoronavirus, WHO recommends people maintain their daily routines and reach out\nfor support and connection.\n\n\u201cEven in situations of isolation, try as much as possible to keep your\npersonal daily routines. Stay connected via email, social media, video\nconference and telephone,\u201d the guidelines say.\n\nEnsuring the mental well-being of all employees, especially in high-stress\ntimes, involves providing communication and access to help, Glass says.\n\n\u201cPutting resources in place or communicating the resources you already have in\nplace can be helpful to your employees,\u201d Glass says. \u201cIf you're feeling\nanxious, it\u2019s a good time to reach out to family members or friends or your\nbehavioral health coach and talk through it. Have some outlets to discuss this\nin a way that's not just social media.\u201d\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e061e3c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x1200+0+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2F5f%2Fee%2F450d602848d39d4a92b4b6010219%2Funnamed-1.jpg)\n](https://www.employeebenefitadviser.com/author/alyssa-place)\n\n[Alyssa

This includes companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Google,\nTwitter and SquareFoot.\n\nFor companies new to or unfamiliar with remote working, this can pose a\nchallenge, especially on a shortened timeframe. Part of this challenge is that\neffective remote working is not merely a technology problem, it is about\nbuilding a dependable culture to enable your remote and office employees to\nfeel connected and empowered _together_.\n\nWhile many technology companies offer remote working, this is not merely the\ndomain of the nerds. More and more companies across different industries are\nsupporting remote working: it can increase productivity, the pool of available\ncandidates for recruitment and provide other benefits.\n\nToday I want to share some pragmatic recommendations of how to get started\nwith remote working for both companies who need to switch to remote working on\na shortened timeline (such as due to Coronavirus) and employees who are being\nasked to work from home.\n\nToday In: [Enterprise Tech](https://www.forbes.com/enterprise-tech)\n\n  * [\n\n### This Emergency Communications Startup Just Raised $15 Million Amid A\nCOVID-19 Boom\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/04/07/this-emergency-\ncommunications-startup-just-raised-15-million-amid-a-covid-19-boom/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Google Starts To Publish Coronavirus Mobility Reports\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ilkerkoksal/2020/04/07/google-starts-to-\npublish-coronavirus-mobility-reports/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Is \u2018Management By Walking Around\u2019 Still Possible When Everything Is\nDigital And Remote?\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2020/04/06/is-management-by-\nwalking-around-still-possible-when-everything-is-digital-and-remote/)\n\n## For Employers\n\nThere are some companies who have spent years refining their remote working\nprocesses and infrastructure. This is especially common in [companies such as\nGitHub](https://remote.co/company/github-inc/\n\"https://remote.co/company/github-inc/\") where a large number of employees\nwork remotely and have done for many years.\n\nWhen operating on a compressed timeline, the key is to get your core remote\nservices and culture up and running efficiently and support the transition for\nyour staff.\n\nThis involves **5** core recommendations:\n\n### 1\\. Enable online platforms for people work in\n\nAt the center of a remote working workplace is a core set of tools that your\nteams need to work in to collaborate and do their jobs. This choice of tools\nvaries from industry to industry and company to company. You may use Google\nDocs for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations. You may use\nMonday.com for project management, Dropbox for file sharing or GitHub for\nengineering.\n\n![GSuite is Google's popular productivity platform, often used in\nbusinesses](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e67c225e1e61700080e6999/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nGSuite is Google's popular productivity platform, often used in businesses\n\nGSuite website\n\nHere\u2019s the key: pick a core set of tools and ensure your teams know how to\nconnect to and use them from home. This may require a VPN to connect, and if\nso, ensure your staff have this set up on their work computers. Support this\nwith simple instructions and guidance.\n\nTry to avoid multiple tools for the same purpose, and ensure that as many of\nthese tools can be signed into with a single account from home. Avoid any\ntools that are tied to a specific office or location; our goal is cross-\ncompany collaboration, irrespective of if you are at HQ or at home.\nFortunately, the broader business world is moving to online tools, so this\ntransition is easier than ever.\n\n### 2\\. Provide simple, accessible communication tools\n\nThe companion to your tools is an online place to connect and communicate with\nother staff members. Tools such as Slack, Mattermost, and Discourse have\nproven popular here. Again, try to pick a single platform that can serve as\nthe company clubhouse for communication and discussion.\n\nYou need to ensure that your chosen communication platform becomes a primary\nway in which people connect. This is not just a place for remote workers, but\noffice workers too.\n\nThis online clubhouse should have three core zoom levels in which a staff\nmember connects:\n\n  * **Team** \\- a place where the staff member and their direct team-mates can chat together (e.g. #europe-sales). This is where team relationships are forged and work gets done.\n  * **Group** \\- a place where the broader department (and all their sub-teams) can communicate together (e.g. #sales). This is where broader discussions, policy and projects are often discussed.\n  * **Company** \\- a place where the entire company and all teams can communicate together (e.g. #allstaff). This is where cross-company relationships are made and people get to know their peers.\n\nYou should allow and enable people to join other team channels where\nappropriate, such as designers joining the #engineering channel, or marketing\nfolks joining #product. This will reduce siloing and increase broader cross-\nfunctional collaboration.\n\nYou should also explore setting up channels where people can be social. Many\ncompanies have #running, #music, and #yoga channels. Part of the staff\nexperience is getting to know each other socially, not just focused on work\nprojects, so be clear that this is ok at your company.\n\nMany of these channels are not just a great place for people to stay\nconnected, but also a great place to communicate news and updates (as I will\ncover later.)\n\nFinally, where possible, try to use video conferencing for meetings as much as\npossible. While not perfect, video conferencing adds a significant amount of\nbody language which is important to help teams feel more connected together.\nSure, people have to put their pants on, but that seems reasonable. :-)\n\n### 3\\. Provide orientation training and a Q&A desk\n\nMany of your staff will be new to remote working and will have a lot questions\nand anxiety about it. You want to help get them up and running as quickly and\neasily as possible.\n\nFirstly, put together a remote working orientation session. This can be a 30\nor 45 minute internal webinar designed for groups of staff members that covers\ntopics such as:\n\n  * How to set up your office set up, have an ergonomic and comfortable desk and chair, and get connected.\n  * An overview of the tools and services available to staff and how to get started.\n  * How to set expectations with your family (such as having a \u201cclosed door policy\u201d when at work), how to set working hours and take breaks.\n  * How to get started in company communication channels and stay up to date with company news and updates.\n  * Where to get help when you need it.\n\nIdeally there should be a company handbook that people can read that also\nincorporates this information for reference.\n\nNow, people are going to need help from time to time. From smaller issues such\nas technical problems to larger challenges with cabin-fever and burnout, they\nneed a place to get safe, accessible, help. Provide both a company-wide\ncommunication channel (such as #remote-helpdesk) where staff can ask questions\nas well as a private place to get help 1-on-1 (such as with personal issues).\nYour HR team should monitor both closely and be responsive.\n\n### 4\\. Provide a regular stream of news and updates to employees\n\nOne of the challenges that faces remote workers is that they lose out on the\n\u201cwatercooler\u201d culture of an office. That is, they often hear about company\nnews and changes last, and miss out on the usual office gossip.\n\nThis can become a problem: human beings have a tendency to assume (or even\nmanufacture) outcomes when they don\u2019t have all the information available.\n\nYou should aim to have a regular drip-feed of information and updates for your\nstaff available via an internal blog and staff webinars. This can cover:\n\n  * Updates about current events facing the company and staff (such as Coronavirus, or large contracts, mergers and changes.)\n  * Announcements of new staff benefits, programs, and changes (such as new HR services, internal education initiatives and more.)\n  * Recognition of notable new projects and accomplishments, and explicitly recognizing staff and teams.\n  * Finer-grained reporting about specific outcomes and projects (such as customer events, sales milestones, new product features and more.)\n\nInformation is power. Make these news bulletins and updates available online\nin a place that everyone has access to.\n\nAnnounce these news updates in your broader communication channels (such as\nyour #allstaff channel) and encourage people to provide input and updates.\n\nAlso, encourage your staff to provide their own news and updates (such as\nspecific initiatives they are working on). This will make your teams feel\nconnected and empowered to share work and progress with the broader company\nand teams.\n\n### 5\\. Expect (and support) a period of adjustment\n\nRemote working is not a panacea. Some employers assume working from home and\navoiding the commute is an enormous benefit for those affected.\n\nFor some people it is the opposite. They need the social and work structure of\nan office. Some struggle to work from home, especially if their home isn\u2019t set\nup well for working, or if there are distractions such as family members and\nroom mates.\n\n![Remote working takes time to adjust](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/1166988159/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nGetty\n\nYou should expect a period of adjustment and ensure your line and departmental\nmanagers are trained to help their team members with this adjustment.\nEncourage managers to have regular meetings with staff to understand their\nremote working needs and resolve any issues. Your staff are not machines and\nwill need to adjust to a new normal.\n\nYou should also empower your staff to feed into and shape how your remote\nworking culture can be improved. Invite staff to provide feedback to improve\ntools, platforms, and communication channels. Ask them to suggest initiatives\nto simplify and ease remote working. If you are intentional about getting\ntheir ideas, it is incredible how creative and useful some of their\nsuggestions will be. You will also give them a feeling of being able to shape\ntheir own remote working environment and that of their colleagues, which is\nenormously empowering for most people.\n\n## For Employees\n\nLet\u2019s now flip the switch.\n\nYou have been asked to work from home. You may have worked from home\noccasionally in the past when you had to be home for that package to be\ndelivered, but how does this work on a day to basis? How do you evade the\ndistractions and temptations dotted around your home? How do you ward-off\ncabin-fever?\n\nThe good news is that remote working can be not just a more efficient way to\nwork, but also one with a lot more control in your life. They key is to be\nintentional about your routine and have a focus on relationships.\n\nHere I have **5** key recommendations:\n\n### 1\\. Set up your office, and lock the door\n\nFirst ensure you have a suitable environment to work from. Ideally, this will\nbe a dedicated office in your house/apartment. Alternatively, it can be a desk\nin your bedroom, or even a portion of your family room or kitchen.\n\nYou should ideally separate as much as possible where you work and where you\nplay. This will help you get into a work mindset when you start your work day\nand make it easier to unplug when you are done for the day.\n\nYour office needs to have some essentials:\n\n  * A computer and high-quality Internet connection that can (where possible) support video-calls.\n  * A desk for your computer, papers, and other items. Standing desks are becoming increasingly popular as an option.\n  * A comfortable, ergonomic chair.\n  * Ideally, a separate monitor, keyboard, and mouse (to reduce eye and wrist strain.)\n\nIdeally, your office will have a door that you can close when you are at work.\nYou need to be able to signal clearly to your family, room mates, and anyone\nelse that when you are at work you shouldn\u2019t be disturbed.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a separate room, set the expectation with other people that\nwhen you are in front of the computer or at your desk during your working\nhours, you should not be disturbed. You should be intentional about this\nexpectation so everyone is clear.\n\nAs a general rule, avoid lounging around on the couch or laying in bed with\nyour laptop to work. Part of the goal here is to build a routine, and part of\nit have a dedicated place and time where you work. This will also help to ease\nthe mental separation between being at work and unplugging when you finish for\nthe day.\n\n### 2\\. Create a schedule and routine, and stick to it\n\nWhere possible, agree with your manager a set of working hours and stick to\nit. This will vary from company to company, and one of the benefits of remote\nworking is that you might be able to factor other parts of your life into this\nschedule.\n\nFor example, some people may work from 9am - 5pm. Others may work 8am - 2pm,\ntake a few hours off to pick the kids up, and then work from 4pm - 5pm. Some\nmay prefer to work from noon until 8pm.Work with your manager to design your\nschedule, and be aligned on expectations of when you are at work.\n\n![Lifestyle_Natalie](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/588683087/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nGetty\n\nMany remote workers fall into the pit of feeling that they need to be online\nall the time. This is a quick path to burnout. Make it clear that outside of\nyour agreed hours you won\u2019t be online. This doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t work\nin your spare time, but you are setting an expectation around core hours and\nthat additional work is your own decision.\n\nSimilarly, build a routine for a typical work day. For example, get up at\n7.30am, get dressed, eat breakfast, and start work at 9am. Avoid deviating\nfrom the schedule. Always get dressed, always make time for breakfast and\nlunch, and take breaks. You are not a robot. This solidification of the\nschedule will make your work feel more predictable and managed.\n\n### 3\\. Manage distractions and understand your \u201cwaves\u201d\n\nThere is no single human psychological mindset. Some days we are motivated,\nexcited, and energized. Some days we feel a little off, tired, and unenthused.\nI call these different psychological states \u201cwaves\u201d and we should understand\nhow they work.\n\nWhen you work in an office, your \u201coff\u201d waves (where you are tired and less\nmotivated) can be often mitigated or reduced by in-person discussions,\ninteraction and lunches. For remote workers the absence of this is what often\nleads to cabin fever. You can\u2019t stop these different waves from happening but\nyou can _manage_ them.\n\nIf you know you are having a bit of an \u201coff\u201d wave, know that you are\nsusceptible to distraction. So, manage it. Shut down Facebook, YouTube,\nTwitter, and Instagram while you focus on your project. Shut down email to\navoid outside distractions. Put your phone on silent for an hour while you get\nthe job done.\n\nThink about what helps when you have these different waves. For example, I\nfind that on my \u201coff\u201d days, working in a coffee keeps me motivated. I have\nalso discovered that going to the gym for an hour in the afternoon will often\nrefresh myself. Try to discover what works for you and integrate into your\nroutine. This is all part of the journey of how to make remote working work\nwell for you.\n\n### 4\\. Be intentional about building relationships\n\nThere is a built-in social environment in an office. People grab lunch, have\ncoffee together, chit-chat while waiting for meetings to start and more. Much\nof this is removed in a remote environment _if_ you are not intentional about\nit.\n\nPencil in calls to catch up with colleagues and get to know them (often\nwithout a fixed agenda). Chit-chat on discussion channels. Share your\ninterests inside and outside of work-focused 1-on-1 discussions.\n\n![Young guy using laptop at desk](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e67c2e07d6f2600068f20c2/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nGetty\n\nAgain, the key here is to be intentional. Some people schedule these sessions\nin their calendar. Some like to pencil in regular 1-on-1 check-in sessions.\nFocus on what works best for you to continue to grow relationships outside of\nyour project and work-specific calls.\n\n### 5\\. Build an open, transparent relationship with your leadership\n\nThe very best managers and leaders in the world don\u2019t just care about having\ntheir teams deliver great work and results, but they also care that their team\nmembers are happy and healthy.\n\nIn an office, many leaders can visibly see when someone has something on their\nmind or is worried about something. In a remote setting these social and body\nlanguage cues are often missing. As such, it is important to try to be as open\nas you feel comfortable with with your manager when you have something on your\nmind.\n\nShare your needs as a remote worker such as access to information, tools, and\nequipment. Share how well collaboration with teammates and other teams is\ngoing and ask for guidance in ways to resolve any issues. Share if you are\nfeeling stressed, burned out, or concerned about something.\n\nI know this will be difficult to do for many of you, especially those of you\nwith absent, dismissive or unsupportive managers. Use your own judgement to\ndetermine how comfortable you are sharing what is on your mind. In some cases\nit may be easier to share your feedback and any concerns privately with a\nmember of HR if you don\u2019t feel your manager is approachable.\n\nRemote working is much easier when you feel like you can be open with your\nleadership about both things that are going well and that are not going well.\n\n## In Conclusion\n\nFor many companies and their staff, remote working is an interesting, exciting\nprospect to be able to grow, be more efficient and have more flexibility. It\noften takes months or even years to lay out these kinds of programs, but in\ntimes like this with COVID-19, there simply isn\u2019t the luxury of a long\ntimeline.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal though: if you have to move fast, it doesn\u2019t have to be\nperfect. Focus on the recommendations I outlined above and it will get you up\nand running with a core remote working environment quickly.\n\nThe key is to include your staff in the process. Make them feel part of\nshaping the environment instead of merely following an online rule book that\nyou give them. As human beings, we customize and tune out houses, desks, cars,\nphones, computers, and more. We have an intrinsic desire to influence and\nshape the world that wraps around us, so tap into this psychological need and\ninclude them in the process. You won\u2019t just get happier staff, but you will\nget better results.

The Series B round -- which moves the\nfirm\u2019s total raise to $19.7 million -- was led by Sequoia India and saw\nparticipation from existing investors Lightspeed India Partners, Endiya\nPartners and 3one4 Capital.\n\nMore than 200 firms -- including giants such as adtech firm [InMobi,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/inmobi) fintech startup [Paytm,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/paytm) drink conglomerate Bisleri,\nautomobile maker Mahindra, Kotak group and delivery firms Swiggy and\nMilkbasket -- use Darwinbox\u2019s HR platform to serve half a million of their\nemployees in 50 nations, Rohit Chennamaneni, co-founder of [Darwinbox,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/darwinbox) told TechCrunch in an\ninterview.\n\nThe startup, which competes with giants such as SAP and [Oracle,\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/oracle) said its platform enables a high\nlevel of configurability and ease of use, and understands the needs of modern\nemployees. \u201cThe employees today who have grown accustomed to using consumer-\nfocused services such as Uber and Amazon are left disappointed in their\nexperience with their own firm\u2019s HR offerings,\u201d said Gowthami Kanumuru, VP\nMarketing at Darwinbox, in an interview.\n\nDarwinbox\u2019s HR platform offers a range of features, including the ability for\nfirms to offer their employees insurance and early salary as loans. Its\nplatform also features social networks for employees within a company to\nconnect and talk, as well as an AI assistant that allows them to apply for a\nleave or set up meetings with quick voice commands from their phone.\n\n\u201cThe AI system is not just looking for certain keywords. If an employee tells\nthe system he or she is not feeling well today, it automatically applies a\nleave for them,\u201d she said.\n\nDarwinbox\u2019s platform is built to handle onboarding new employees, keep a tab\non their performance, monitor attrition rate and maintain an ongoing feedback\nloop. Or as Kanumuru puts it, the entire \u201chiring to retiring\u201d cycle.\n\nOne of Darwinbox\u2019s clients is L&T, which is tasked with setting up subways in\nmany Indian cities. L&T is using Darwin's geo-fencing feature to log the\nattendance of employees. \u201cThey are not using biometric punch machine that is\ntypically used by other firms. Instead, they just require their 1,200\nemployees to check-in from the workplace using their phones,\u201d said Kanumuru.\n\n![darwinbox event](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/darwinbox_event.jpg)\n\nAdditionally, Darwinbox is largely focusing on serving companies based in Asia\nas it believes Western companies\u2019 solutions are not a great fit for people\nhere, said Kanumuru. The startup began courting clients in Southeast Asian\nmarkets last year.\n\n\u201cOur growth is a huge validation for our vision,\u201d she said. \u201cWithin six months\nof operations, we had the delivery giant [Delhivery\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/delhivery) with over 23,000 employees\nuse our platform.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to TechCrunch, Dev Khare, a partner at [Lightspeed\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/lightspeed-financial) Venture, said,\n\u201cthere is a new trend of SaaS companies targeting the India/SE Asia markets.\nThis trend is gathering steam and is disproving the conventional wisdom that\nAsia-focused SaaS companies cannot get to be big companies. We firmly believe\nthat Asia-focused SaaS companies can get to large impact value and become\nlarge and profitable. Darwinbox is one of these companies.\u201d\n\nDarwinbox\u2019s Chennamaneni said the startup will use the fresh capital to expand\nits footprints in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and other Southeast Asian\nmarkets. Darwinbox also will expand its product offerings to address more of\nemployees\u2019 needs. The startup is also looking to make its platform enable\ntasks such as booking of flights and hotels.\n\nChennamaneni, an alum of [Google ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/google)\nand McKinsey, said Darwinbox aims to double the number of clients it has in\nthe next six to nine months.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Google Cloud

And that's okay,\nwrites Amy Nelmes Bissett.\n\n![No caption](/assets/news_crops/99652/eight_col_41581615_m.jpg?1586305454)\n\nPhoto: 123RF\n\nA global pandemic suffered by more than a million people, taking the lives of\njust over 60,000 and plunging the world's economy into the pits of hell might\nseem like a justifiable time to feel frightened, or at best a little blue, but\nthat's not what you should be doing with all that extra time on your hands.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow, of Hollywood acting and lifestyle guru fame, has an idea. In\na recent YouTube video titled \"How Do You Find Intimacy in Uncertain Times?\"\nshe sprouted that this \"unique opportunity\" should be used to improve your\nrelationship. We should be learning to communicate a little better, Gwynie\nbelieves.\n\nShe does, however, overlook it's a smidgen easier when you've a pick of five\nsprawling mansions for isolation. Us mere mortals, spending 24/7 with too many\nfamily members in often a too small a space, are likely finding it all a\nlittle too intimate right now.\n\nNonetheless, her off-key advice is hardly novel. Since our lives became\nundeniably housebound after March's lockdown to halt the spread of\ncoronavirus, there's been an echoing sentiment that each second should be\nfilled with ways to better ourselves. Not a moment of this glorious unexpected\n\"free time\" should be wasted.\n\nAnd we do have a lot more time right now. The commute is now a few steps to\nwhatever WFH station you've set up (if you're lucky enough to still have a\njob). And while many are balancing life as a untrained teacher with their own\nwork, there's no time-stealing school runs or after-school activities to taxi\nchildren to and from.\n\nIt's what we've always wanted, isn't it? More time to finally do all the\nthings that our daily lives keep us from. And so, our homes should be Marie\nKondo-perfection. Our life admin list ticked to completion. And then, why not\nlearn a language? Do an online course? Jesus, you could even write a book or\nmaster the pottery wheel.\n\nIn fact, investment platform Hatch want you to learn the art of investing via\ntheir free 10-day online course. HR consultancy Humankind have 1:1 tutorials\non how to be a great leader (once this is all over, of course). And Massey\nUniversity have a free introductory course to learn te reo M\u0101ori.\n\nAnd it's all so wonderful and productive and, well, exhausting.\n\nIt appears that a global pandemic can't even derail our obsession with being\nbusy. And it is an obsession. We're gripped by a culture that commands we spin\nmany plates, juggle many balls. Are you really living your life to its maximum\npotential if you aren't constantly close to burn out?\n\nThe current workforce in New Zealand works longer hours than any other\ngeneration before. For the best part, we also never truly clock-off thanks to\nmodern technology. And all of us, but mainly women, juggle a multitude of\nroles: mother, worker and wife, with the expectation that we look good, eat\nhealthily and also balance a social life. Busy.\n\nAnd you'd think that a pandemic leaching through the human race would be\nstress enough for most of us, without having to add in a 10-week course\nlearning code or making the perfect sourdough bread. But sitting still, just\nbeing and waiting it out goes against the grain, doesn't it? We're not quite\nsure how to stop. We've never had the opportunity before.\n\nBut perhaps this will make it easier: In six months, maybe sooner but likely\nlonger, each of us are going to have to work hard to rebuild everything that\nthe Covid-19 has annihilated. Every country will face high levels of poverty,\nunemployment and mental health problems. The health care system and economy\nwill be ravaged.\n\nAnd here's the reality: learning French or Gwyneth Paltrow'ing your\nrelationship isn't going to help. What will is taking the pressure off. It's\nusing this time to hibernate and to breathe. Getting through a pandemic, just\nsurviving, is really enough right now.\n\nAnd if you can muster it, perhaps enjoy the things that spark joy. Delicious\nmeals, a few extra glasses of wine, a few more hours of Netflix or a podcast.\nBecause before we know it, we'll be out of lockdown, and the busyness of\nmodern life will be fired-up once again. It's just this time we'll be doing it\nwhile navigating a very different world.\n\n**_Amy Nelmes Bissett is a freelance writer based in Warkworth._**\n\nShare this\n\n  * [Share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Pressure%20to%20be%20lockdown-productive%20isn%27t%20helpful&url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/on-the-inside/413799/pressure-to-be-lockdown-productive-isn-t-helpful \"Share on Twitter\")\n  * [Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rnz.co.nz%2Fnews%2Fon-the-inside%2F413799%2Fpressure-to-be-lockdown-productive-isn-t-helpful \"Share on Facebook\")\n  * [Share via email](mailto:%20?subject=Pressure%20to%20be%20lockdown-productive%20isn%27t%20helpful&body=I%20thought%20you%20might%20be%20interested%20in%20this%20page%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rnz.co.nz%2Fnews%2Fon-the-inside%2F413799%2Fpressure-to-be-lockdown-productive-isn-t-helpful%20from%20RNZ. \"Share by Email\")\n  * [Share on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/on-the-inside/413799/pressure-to-be-lockdown-productive-isn-t-helpful \"Share on Reddit\")\n  * [Share on Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/on-the-inside/413799/pressure-to-be-lockdown-productive-isn-t-helpful \"Share on Linked In\")\n\nCopyright (C) 2020, Radio New Zealand\n\nSubscribe to RNZ's Daily Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n[View latest newsletter](http://us6.campaign-\narchive2.com/home/?u=211a938dcf3e634ba2427dde9&id=b3d362e693)\n\nNext story in Comment & Analysis\n\n### [Power Play: Health Minister David Clark's lack of judgement a distraction\nat time of great crisis](/news/on-the-inside/413649/power-play-health-\nminister-david-clark-s-lack-of-judgement-a-distraction-at-time-of-great-\ncrisis)\n\n### Comment & Analysis\n\n  * [Pressure to be lockdown-productive isn't helpful](/news/on-the-inside/413799/pressure-to-be-lockdown-productive-isn-t-helpful)\n  * [Power Play: Health Minister David Clark's lack of judgement a distraction at time of great crisis](/news/on-the-inside/413649/power-play-health-minister-david-clark-s-lack-of-judgement-a-distraction-at-time-of-great-crisis)\n  * [Mauao / Mount Maunganui gets a rest during the lockdown](/news/on-the-inside/413748/mauao-mount-maunganui-gets-a-rest-during-the-lockdown)\n\n## Get the RNZ app\n\nfor ad-free news and current affairs\n\n[![Download from Apple App Store](https://www.rnz.co.nz/x/app-ad/app-store-\nbadge-f124803f7ddaf7e359d2f07ba1761f5c0e592dc3ea1f8fff5da17696ff88820f.svg)](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/rnz/id407890305)\n[![Download from Google Play Store](https://www.rnz.co.nz/x/app-ad/google-\nplay-\nbadge-c9fcf15fa7b7194040daa5dfd9c7e2796a7cd1a72df997906d98db4d5ffce4e9.svg)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.co.radionz.android&hl=en)\n\n![](https://www.rnz.co.nz/x/app-ad/app-ad-news-device-\none-701ebe867ca28af055c8d91e5f059c782a656b73cdc2200daf786c9dbd32040c.png)\n\n![](https://www.rnz.co.nz/x/app-ad/app-ad-news-device-\ntwo-e294322b6bfb4a70fd634520b44ca44cc8eb7978f1fdf3dfbb907fedde92271b.png)\n\n###  Top News stories\n\n  * [Covid-19: The key developments in New Zealand from April 8](/news/national/413802/covid-19-the-key-developments-in-new-zealand-from-april-8)\n  * [M\u0101ori doctor accuses John Tamihere of telling staff to lie for Covid-19 test](/news/te-manu-korihi/413791/maori-doctor-accuses-john-tamihere-of-telling-staff-to-lie-for-covid-19-test)\n  * [Covid-19 Q and A: How to investigate a crime during a pandemic](/news/national/413805/covid-19-q-and-a-how-to-investigate-a-crime-during-a-pandemic)\n  * [Employees say worker subsidy not being paid in full](/news/national/413797/employees-say-worker-subsidy-not-being-paid-in-full)\n  * [Pressure to be lockdown-productive isn't helpful](/news/on-the-inside/413799/pressure-to-be-lockdown-productive-isn-t-helpful)\n\n### Subscribe\n\nSubscribe to RNZ's Daily Newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n[View latest newsletter](http://us6.campaign-\narchive2.com/home/?u=211a938dcf3e634ba2427dde9&id=b3d362e693)\n\nSubscribe to the Covid-19 newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n[View latest newsletter](http://us6.campaign-\narchive2.com/home/?u=211a938dcf3e634ba2427dde9&id=7f4e907d1d)\n\n[__Comment & Analysis RSS](/rss/on-the-inside.xml)\n\n[__Follow RNZ News](https://twitter.com/rnz_news)\n\n### RNZ stations\n\n  * [National](/national)\n  * [Concert](/concert)\n  * [RNZ Pacific](/international)\n  * [Parliament -

The number is expected to rise amid the\ndangers posed by the novel coronavirus Covid-19.\n\n[READ MORE: Coronavirus: How can HR manage remote\nstaff?](https://www.hcamag.com/ca/specialization/workplace-health-and-\nsafety/coronavirus-how-can-hr-manage-remote-staff/214522)\n\n**Driven by cloud and mobile technology**  \nA pandemic could see millions more relying on technology - particularly,\nmobile and cloud-based productivity and messaging tools such as Slack or Zoom\n- to stay connected even from home.\n\nAlready, stocks of team collaboration software Slack have surged almost 40%\nsince January, while established brands like Microsoft and Google remain\nstrong thanks to the demand for better work tools accessible from anywhere.\n\nOne unintended result of the outbreak: the shift to remote work gives\nemployees a \"chance to try a new way of living and new way of [working],\" said\nDaniel Zhang, CEO of Chinese ecommerce group Alibaba, in a recent earnings\ncall.\n\nAlibaba, which instructed its employees to work in a virtual set-up from home,\nhas also seen its enterprise communication tool DingTalk become the most\ndownloaded free iOS app in China. The so-called 'mobile office toolbox' allows\nusers to report to work, track and update the status of projects, check the\nattendance of team members, and communicate one on one or as a group.\n\nMany workplace tech businesses are also responding to the challenge of\nCovid-19 by offering some of their premium services for free.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\nJust this week, Google began giving free access to the more advanced features\nof its video conferencing tool Hangouts Meet to G Suite customers.\n\nHangouts users can now set up larger meetings with up to 250 participants,\nlive stream with up to 100,000 viewers, and record meetings and save them on\nGoogle Drive.\n\n\"As more businesses adjust their work-from-home policies and adopt reduced\ntravel plans in response to COVID-19, we're helping to ensure that all\nglobally distributed teams can still reliably meet face to face, even if\nemployees are not in the same location,\" said Javier Soltero, Google's general\nmanager and vice president for G Suite.\n\nMural, another collaboration software, is also rolling out services for free\nto help businesses, now grappling with a sudden change to their routine,\n\"reduce the amount of disruption\" brought about by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nUnlike most team productivity tools that rely on a chatroom style of\ncommunication, the platform works like a digital 'white board' to enable teams\nto visualise their processes through diagrams, charts and drawings. No matter\nwhere they are or what time zone they work in, users can scribble on shared\nfiles, jot down ideas and exchange virtual 'sticky notes' faster.\n\n[READ MORE: Twitter urges global employees to work from\nhome](https://www.hcamag.com/ca/business-news/coronavirus-twitter-urges-\nglobal-employees-to-work-from-home/215547)\n\n**Handling corporate files on a personal device**  \nBut managing teams remotely also carries its own risks. The most important one\nis keeping corporate and personal files secure.\n\nSome companies have a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy that allows\nemployees to run office apps on their personal device, but this can sometimes\nblur the boundaries between personal and corporate use.\n\nEmployees who work remotely prefer to delineate the two, said Tzachi Zack,\nchief product officer of Cubed Mobile.\n\n\"Users prefer not to have access to business data from their mobile devices to\navoid installation of Mobile Device Management (MDM) tools on their mobile\ndevices,\" Zack told HRD.\n\nMDMs, he said, \"penetrate into [the user's] private data and activities.\" But\ntoo much surveillance can also ruin trust.\n\nThe solution is to manage corporate and personal files separately through a\ndedicated workspace app. Cubed Mobile, for instance, keeps all work-related\nfiles on a personal device \"encapsulated and encrypted,\" Zack said.\n\nWhile the worker continues to access their 'virtual workspace,' the employer\ncan monitor all aspects pertaining only to work.\n\n\"The technology can be up and running within a few minutes, which means that\nit can be used on the fly, which is critical during this time of 'sudden\nquarantine,'\" Zack said.\n\n\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the

you using recruitment marketing videos to their fullest potential? If\nnot, 2020 may be the year to get started. In this article, we discuss:_**\n\n  * **_Stages of the recruitment funnel that you can transform with video_**\n  * **_4 reasons why recruitment marketing videos should be a recruitment staple in 2020_**\n  * **_Tips and tools to get started_**\n\n  \nIn 2020, companies must go the extra mile to strengthen their employer brand\nin a tight hiring environment.\n\nRecruitment marketing videos have proven beneficial in this regard, helping to\nattract candidates at the start of the recruitment funnel. Videos can also be\nused throughout the recruitment process to deliver a more engaging [candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/).\n\nBefore we discuss exactly why you need recruitment marketing videos in 2020,\nlet\u2019s look at the various application areas to consider.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **5 Examples of Brilliant Recruitment Marketing Campaigns You\nCan Learn From**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/examples-of-brilliant-recruitment-marketing-campaigns-you-can-\nlearn-from/)\n\n## **Stages of the Recruitment Funnel Where Video Intervention Makes Sense**\n\nIf we look at candidates as we would a consumer, [recruitment\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-\nrecruitment/)can be broken down into four stages: awareness, interest, desire,\nand action. Video can bolster [recruitment\nmarketing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-recruitment-marketing-and-how-do-best-employers-use-it/)\nacross all four.\n\n  * **Awareness:** Short videos to share on social media, which depict the employee experience at your company, can make job seekers outside your region/immediate domain aware of the employer brand.  \n\n  * **Interest:** Videos embedded on your website and career pages showcasing the company culture inspire interest in what you do and how you do it, making candidates more likely to apply when an opening is available.  \n\n  * **Desire:** Video job descriptions that make candidates _feel_ like they would be a good fit speak directly to candidates and call for action.  \n\n  * **Action:** Video applications and video interviews give candidates the flexibility to connect from anywhere, at any time, at their convenience and make the application process more candidate-centric across the recruitment funnel.\n\n  \nAs you can see, recruitment marketing videos aren\u2019t just glorified ads for a\ncompany. They holistically engage with your talent pool and build a lasting\nrelationship.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Top 8 Recruitment Marketing Trends for 2020 and\nBeyond**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nrecruitment-marketing-trends/)\n\n## **4 Reasons Why You Need Recruitment Marketing Videos**\n\nWhile video has been a popular recruitment marketing tool for a while now,\nemployers simply cannot ignore it in 2020. Here\u2019s why:\n\n### **1\\. Gen Z prioritizes video as a key method of brand discovery**\n\n  \nThe top platform for discovering new brands (in other words, awareness) has\nchanged dramatically over the decades.\n\nHow does [Gen Z ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/recruiting-and-retaining-generation-z/)find their brands of choice,\nboth to purchase products and to find employment?\n\nResearch suggests that Gen Z is rapidly turning to video for brand discovery\nand engagement. More than half of Gen Z in an international\n[survey](https://www.pitneybowes.com/us/blog/cmo-council-study.html) of 2,000\ncross-generational respondents said that they want videos to portray their\nareas of interest.\n\nIn short, employer brands looking to make an impression on Gen Z talent\nentering the workforce in 2020 must necessarily use video.\n\n### **2\\. Recruitment marketing videos convert static content into a story**\n\n  \nWhat better way to foster engagement and build relationships via\n[storytelling](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/3-ways-storytelling-defines-your-employer-branding-strategy/)?\nHowever, this isn\u2019t always so easy. A job description for a senior-level\nposition that might run up to 1,000+ words risks becoming dense and\nuninspiring.\n\nBy converting the job description into a coherent narrative (i.e., a story),\nrecruiters have a better chance of holding candidate attention and evoking an\naction from the best talent.\n\nA [survey ](https://www.ragan.com/survey-measurement-storytelling-cited-as-\ntop-weaknesses/)of 576 respondents found that nearly 31% of HR professionals\nfind it challenging to tell interesting stories about \"boring topics.\" This is\nwhere recruitment marketing videos could change the narrative.\n\nInstead of listing job requirements as static text (incidentally, 38% of HR\nprofessionals find it difficult to \u201cwrite creatively\u201d), you can have a video\nwhere the business unit manager, the team lead, and the recruiter discuss the\nvarious aspects of an open position or simply those of working with the\norganization.\n\n### **3\\. Recruitment marketing videos can increase the number of views and\napplicants per job post**\n\n  \nWith so many companies vying for the best talent available, it can be\nchallenging to get your job ads viewed in the first place. Imagine a scenario\nwhere the job is absolutely perfect for a candidate who simply scrolled over\nbecause the title did not catch their attention \u2013 this would be a lose-lose\nfor everyone.\n\nThat\u2019s why it is a good idea to embed videos in job ads, as well as embed a\nvideo emoji in the job ad title. Interestingly, [a report by\nCareerBuilder](https://hiring.careerbuilder.co.uk/e-book-best-practices-for-\nwriting-a-better-job-posting) (email required) found that job postings with\nvideo icons on the CareerBuilder platform got 12% more views than ones without\nvideo.\n\nAnd the benefits don\u2019t end there \u2013 [CareerBuilder\n](https://www.careerbuilder.com/)users who embraced the power of recruitment\nmarketing videos achieved a 34% uptick in application rates!\n\n### **4\\. You can leverage VR to create immersive recruitment marketing\nvideos**\n\n  \nWe have been discussing the mainstream adoption of VR for a while now, but\n2020 could be the year when this technology takes off.\n\nAll signs point in this direction \u2013 according to [one\nestimate](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/virtual-reality-\nmarket), the VR market will expand at an astonishing 48.7% compound annual\ngrowth rate (CAGR) in the next five years! This could be because affordable VR\nhardware is now easily available. In 2019, the Oculus Quest headset got a $400\nlaunch, making it accessible to young professionals around the world.\n\nIn other words, the climate is just right for VR usage among your intended\ncandidate pool. 360-degree videos that take advantage of this technology can\ndeliver immersive and compelling experiences to candidates.\n\nRecruiters can even partner with providers like\n[360dgrees](https://360dgrees.com/) to create VR-enabled recruitment marketing\nvideos at low costs (360dgrees is free forever for up to three videos).\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How to Create a Great Branded Recruitment\nVideo**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-\nto-create-a-great-branded-recruitment-video/)\n\n## **Getting Started With Recruitment Marketing Videos in 2020**\n\nYou can use several tools to create recruitment marketing videos, making it\npossible to get started even if you do not have [video marketing skill sets\nwithin your organization](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-tips-for-creating-a-recruitment-video-inhouse/). Here are a\ncouple of options to consider:\n\n  * [**Hinterview**](https://hello.hinterview.com/) ** _:_** A video engagement platform for recruiters that lets you create videos, share them through links, and gather real-time feedback through emails.\n  * [**Cammio**](https://cammio.com/our-platform/stories/) ** _:_** A platform to create videos about open positions, where you identify topics, submit smartphone clips on each topic, and Cammio weaves it into a video story.\n\n  \nLet us leave you with a simple #ProTip: modern candidates want to connect with\nyour employer brand through video, and you have 1 minute 36 seconds (on\naverage) to tell your story. This\n[data](https://www.skillscout.com/blog/thinking-of-creating-a-job-\nvideo-3-youtube-analytics-you-should-know) from Skill Scout\u2019s 450+ employer\nvideos across YoutTube and Vimeo reveals the importance of short, crisp,\nintelligently created recruitment marketing videos in 2020.\n\nBy using the right tools and identifying points of video intervention on your\nrecruitment funnel, you can address the four factors mentioned and build a\nwinning recruitment marketing strategy this year.\n\n_What is your preferred tool for making recruitment marketing videos?

And the idea of a\ncommunity at work is always so important especially in a field such as theirs\nwhere entertainment is a creative process and best experienced with a\ncommunity. How did the firm build a culture of collaboration for creative\nideation?\n\nIn an exclusive interaction with us, Shamita Ghosh, Head-Human Resources,\nBookMyShow shares an interesting initiative undertaken by the company to\nelevate employee experience by building a culture ripe for creative ideation.\n\n![bookmyshow](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1585720908/Shamita_Ghosh_uonaai.jpg)\n\n### The Problem Statement\n\nFor a long time, the different teams of the BookMyShow family worked out of\ndifferent physical office spaces until recently (last November) when they all\nmoved into our new, consolidated office building in Mumbai. While they did\nhave enough options to facilitate inter-departmental interaction, and learning\nthrough various team-building initiatives, there was a need for a more\nabsolute and seamless collaboration for creative ideation across departments\nand levels of management. The firm was looking for ways to not only enhance\nthe overall culture of BookMyShow but also instill a sense of community\namongst our employees for a better experience.\n\n### The Implementation of \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019\n\nWith this in mind, the firm conceptualized and put together \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019,\nan initiative that regularly creates and executes employee engagement\ninitiatives. The idea of \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 is to bring back some of this\nentertainment to the employees and have some creative activities planned\nwherein they can take the quotient of having fun at the workplace, higher and\nlet their hair down every once in a while. After long hours at work, it\u2019s very\nnatural that they deserve a treat in the manner that they enjoy most.\n\n### Rolling out \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019\n\nThe firm launched the \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 program in a way that created buzz and\ncuriosity about this new initiative across the workplace. It sent out some\ninteresting notes on various activities that didn\u2019t give away the full\ninformation but kept it intriguing for employees-displaying them in common\nareas such as waiting areas, elevators, cafeteria and washrooms. It then\ncreated a very visually attractive calendar for the month, informing employees\nof the various events and sessions that were lined up for that month.\n\nCulture Canvas spans everything from open mics, stand-up comedy gigs, live\nmusic performances by bands or artists to board games, table tennis, and other\nsporting tournaments, dance workshops, drama sessions, movie screenings,\nmental health and wellness sessions, fitness sessions, masterclass sessions,\ncooking workshops and much more.\n\nEach week would have a planned initiative that would take place during the\nevenings within a specific area of the office, where employees would gather\ntogether and be a part. \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 includes activities twice each week,\ntypically on Wednesdays and Fridays. All employees are sent an email and\nregistration form to join in. Employees can register for their chosen activity\nand they are informed of the event through a calendar invite.\n\nThis initiative intended to let the employees break free and explore various\ncreative outlets while at work as also to unwind in the evening with something\nfun. It was meant to allow them to enjoy their time after a long arduous day\nat work and most importantly, get introduced and engage with new colleagues\neach time. As acquaintance builds, so does engagement across departments. This\neventually leads to a significantly better and collaborative culture.\n\n![bookmyshow](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/v1585721607/Orange_College_Application_Timeline_Infographic_1_aourof.jpg)\n\n###  Challenges in Execution\n\n\u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 brings in experts and artists from the outside world to\nBookMyShow for several of its activities. So initially getting external talent\nto come in and host sessions, when the initiative was newly launched was a bit\ntough since it hadn\u2019t been done with the kind of frequency that BookMyShow has\nadopted. However, with BookMyShow already being the pioneer in the\nentertainment space, with so much to offer for users, it was a matter of time\nbefore it was able to establish strong and meaningful connections with the\ncreative fraternity for these sessions and drive these activities.\n\n### The ROI from \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 for Employee Experience\n\n\u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 has helped BookMyShow improve employee experience in a\nmassive way. It received a lot of positive feedback from employees on how they\nfeel rejuvenated and creatively energized even at the end of a long day. There\nhas been a lot of curiosity and excitement about each event and the upcoming\nones that employees can be part of. The firm also received a lot of\nsuggestions from them on the kind of activities that they would like to be\nincluded that may be beneficial and enjoyable for them.\n\n> Adds Shamita, \u201c\u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 has not only brought a breath of fresh air\n> into the way employees engage with the organization but also brought people\n> a whole lot closer than earlier. It has infused a great deal of optimism and\n> positivity into the work culture, which we believe is a fantastic\n> achievement, especially since we tend to spend several wakeful hours at\n> work.\u201d\n\n### Future plans based on the outcomes of the Case Study\n\nThe firm continues to drive \u2018Culture Canvas\u2019 at the same frequency, even\nduring this lock-down period by enabling virtual fitness sessions with experts\nfor employees and specific upskilling courses through secondary learning that\nrange from soft skills to data science and technology. The firm has also\nstarted hosting a special break session virtually called 'Chai-Time Quickies',\nwhere it creates and curates entertaining contests and video content for\nengaging with employees, becoming their tea-time companions while they are\naway. The idea is to continue to bring to employees of BookMyShow, the\nentertainment they deserve, at work even during these times of a lockdown\namidst the global health crisis.\n\nTaking it further, the firm also recently launched \u2018BookMyShow Communities\u2019,\nwhich are common interest groups of readers, travelers, techies, fitness\nfreaks and karaoke lovers. The groups become spaces where people can read a\ncommon book together and review it, or create a travel blog about their travel\nexperiences, have coding challenges and tech quizzes together, create fitness\nprograms and share workouts, sing and share karaoke songs and much more. The\nmotive of the groups is to enable people with similar interests to make new\nfriends across departments within the company and engage with many more people\nthan they usually do, through discussions and activities.\n\n> Shamita aptly adds, \u201cAs India\u2019s leading entertainment destination,\n> BookMyShow is not just for its customers but equally so for its employees\n> who work hard to provide the best of it for millions of users. We hope to be\n> able to get back to the office safe and soon enough to further build on\n> these initiatives.\u201d\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Employee Engagement](/category/compensation-\nperformance/employee-engagement?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=employee-\nengagement \"Browse more in: Employee Engagement\"),\n[#CXtoEX](/tag/cxtoex?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=cxtoex \"Browse more\nin: CXtoEX\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Shweta Modgil](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1524982217/authors/shweta-\nmodgil.jpg)](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\n#### [Shweta Modgil](/author/shweta-modgil)\n\nShweta is working as a Senior Features Writer with People Matters.

Widener, Technical Director of BAE Systems\u2019 Advanced Analytics Lab -\nInterview Series](https://www.unite.ai/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/IMG_8487-Don-Widener.jpg)\n\nDon Widener is the Technical Director of [BAE Systems\u2019 Advanced Analytics\nLab](https://www.baesystems.com/en-us/feature/welcome-to-the-advanced-\nanalytics-lab-blog) and [Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR)\nAnalysis Portfolio](https://www.baesystems.com/en/our-company/our-\nbusinesses/intelligence-and-security/capabilities-and-services/intelligence-\nsurveillance-reconnaissance).\n\n[BAE Systems](https://www.baesystems.com/en/home) is a global defense,\naerospace and security company employing around 83,000 people worldwide. Their\nwide-ranging products and services cover air, land and naval forces, as well\nas advanced electronics, security, information technology, and support\nservices.\n\n **What was it that initially attracted you personally to AI and robotics?**\n\nI\u2019ve always been interested in augmenting the ability of intelligence analysts\nto be more effective in their mission, whether that is through trade-craft\ndevelopment or technology. With an intelligence analysis background myself,\nI\u2019ve focused my career on closing the gap between intelligence data collection\nand decision making.\n\n\n\n **In August, 2019[BAE Systems announced a partnership with UiPath, to launch\nthe Robotic Operations Center](https://technical.ly/dc/2019/08/20/bae-systems-\nis-launching-a-robotic-operations-center-in-nova/) which will bring automation\nand [machine learning](https://www.unite.ai/what-is-machine-learning/)\ncapabilities to U.S. defense and intelligence communities. Could you describe\nthis partnership?**\n\nDemocratizing AI for our 2,000+ intelligence analysts is a prime driver for\nBAE Systems Intelligence & Security sector\u2019s Advanced Analytics Lab. By using\nRobotic Process Automation (RPA) tools like UiPath we could rapidly augment\nour analysts with tailored training courses and communities of practice (like\nthe Robotic Operations Center), driving gains in efficiency and effectiveness.\nAnalysts with no programming foundation can build automation models or \u201cbots\u201d\nto address repetitive tasks.\n\n\n\n **How will the bots from the Robotic Operations Center be used to combat\ncybercrime?**\n\nThere is a major need for applying AI to external threat data collection for\nCyber Threat analysis. At RSA 2020, we partnered with Dell to showcase their\nAI Ready Bundle for Machine Learning, which includes NVIDIA GPUs, libraries\nand frameworks, and management software in a complete solution stack. We\nshowcased human-machine teaming by walking conference goers through an object\ndetection model creation used to filter publicly available data to identify\nphysical threat hot spots, which may trigger cybercrime.\n\n\n\n **Vast seas of big data will be collected to train the neural networks used\nby the bots. What are some of the datasets that will be collected?**\n\nBAE Systems was recently awarded the [Army\u2019s Open Source Intelligence\n(OSINT)](https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2012/09/army_osint/) contract\nresponsible for integrating big data capabilities into our secure cloud\nhosting environment.\n\n\n\n **Could you describe some of the current[deep\nlearning](https://www.unite.ai/what-is-deep-learning/) methodologies being\nworked on at BAE Systems?**\n\nSome of the deep learning methodologies we are working on are Motion Imagery,\nHumanitarian Disaster Relief, and COVID-19.\n\n\n\n **Do you believe that object detection, and classification, is still an issue\nwhen it comes to objects which are only partially visible or obscured by other\nobjects?**\n\n[Computer vision](https://www.unite.ai/what-is-computer-vision/) models are\nless effective when partially obscured, but for national mission initiatives\nlike Foundational Military Intelligence, even high false positive rates could\nstill support decision advantage.\n\n\n\n **What are some of the other challenges facing computer vision?**\n\nData labeling is a challenge. We\u2019ve partnered with several data labeling\ncompanies for labeling unclassified data, but for classified data we are using\nour intelligence analyst workforce to support these CV training initiatives\nand this workforce is a finite resource.\n\n _Thank you for this interview.

Rather than blocking hackers, they entice them in.\n\nThe newly developed method is called DEEP-Dig (DEcEPtion DIGging), and it\nentices hackers into a decoy site so that the computer can learn their\ntactics. The computer is then trained with the information in order to\nrecognize and stop future attacks.\n\nThe UT Dallas researchers presented their paper titled \u201cImproving Intrusion\nDetectors by Crook-Sourcing,\u201d at the annual Computer Security Applications\nConference in December in Puerto Rico. The group also presented \u201cAutomating\nCyberdeception Evaluation with [Deep Learning](https://www.unite.ai/what-is-\ndeep-learning/)\u201d at the Hawaii International Conference of System Sciences in\nJanuary.\n\nDEEP-Dig is part of an increasingly popular cybersecurity field called\ndeception technology. As evident by the name, this field relies on traps that\nare set for hackers. Researchers are hoping that this will be able to be used\neffectively for defense organizations.\n\nDr. Kevin Hamlen is a Eugene McDermott Professor of computer science.\n\n\"There are criminals trying to attack our networks all the time, and normally\nwe view that as a negative thing,\" he said. \"Instead of blocking them, maybe\nwhat we could be doing is viewing these attackers as a source of free labor.\nThey're providing us data about what malicious attacks look like. It's a free\nsource of highly prized data.\"\n\nThis new approach is being used to solve some of the major problems associated\nwith the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for cybersecurity. One of those\nproblems is that there is a shortage of data needed to train computers to\ndetect hackers, and this is caused by privacy concerns. According to Gbadebo\nAyoade MS\u201914, PhD\u201919, better data means a better ability to detect attacks.\nAyoade presented the findings at the conferences, and he is now a data\nscientist at Procter & Gamble Co.\n\n\"We're using the data from hackers to train the machine to identify an\nattack,\" said Ayoade. \"We're using deception to get better data.\"\n\nThe most common method used by hackers is to begin with simpler tricks and\nprogressively get more sophisticated, according to Hamlen. Most of the cyber\ndefense programs being used today attempt to disrupt the intruders\nimmediately, so the intruders\u2019 techniques are never learned. DEEP-Dig attempts\nto solve this by pushing the hackers into a decoy site full of disinformation\nso that the techniques can be observed. According to Dr. Latifur Khan,\nprofessor of computer science at UT Dallas, the decoy site appears legitimate\nto the hackers.\n\n\"Attackers will feel they're successful,\" Khan said.\n\nCyberattacks are a major concern for governmental agencies, businesses,\nnonprofits, and individuals. According to a report to the White House from the\nCouncil of Economic Advisers, the attacks cost the U.S. economy more than $57\nbillion in 2016.\n\nDEEP-Dig could play a major role in evolving defense tactics at the same time\nhacking techniques evolve. The intruders could disrupt the method if they\nrealize they have entered into a decoy site, but Hamlen is not overly\nconcerned.\n\n\"So far, we've found this doesn't work. When an attacker tries to play along,\nthe defense system just learns how hackers try to hide their tracks,\" Hamlen\nsaid. \"It's an all-win situation -- for us, that is.\"\n\nOther researchers involved in the work include Frederico Araujo PhD'16,\nresearch scientist at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center; Khaled Al-Naami\nPhD'17; Yang Gao, a UT Dallas computer science graduate student; and Dr. Ahmad\nMustafa of Jordan University of Science and Technology.\n\nThe research was partly supported by the Office of Naval Research, the\nNational Security Agency, the National Science Foundation, and the Air Force\nOffice of Scientific Research.\n\n\n\nSpread the love\n\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n\n[ Continue Reading](https://www.unite.ai/deep-learning-used-to-trick-hackers/)\n\n### [Cybersecurity](https://www.unite.ai/cybersecurity/)\n\n# Startups Creating AI Tools To Detect Email Harassment\n\n![mm](https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/daniel-\nnelson-150x150.jpg)\n\nPublished\n\n3 months ago\n\non\n\nJanuary 5, 2020\n\nBy\n\n[Daniel Nelson](https://www.unite.ai/author/danielnelson/ \"Posts by Daniel\nNelson\") [ __](https://twitter.com/danupnelson) [\n__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-nelson-1736b6119/)\n\n![Startups Creating AI Tools To Detect Email\nHarassment](https://www.unite.ai/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/email-3249062_1280.png)\n\nSince the Me Too movement came to prominence in late 2017, more and more\nattention is paid to incidents of sexual harassment, including workplace\nharassment and harassment through email or instant messaging.\n\n[As reported by The\nGuardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/03/metoobots-\nscientists-develop-ai-detect-harassment), AI researchers and engineers have\nbeen creating tools to detect harassment through text communications, dubbed\nMeTooBots. MeTooBots are being implemented by companies around the world in\norder to flag potentially harmful and harassing communications. One example of\nthis is a bot created by the company Nex AI, which is currently being used by\naround 50 different companies. The bot utilizes an algorithm that examines\ncompany documents, chat and emails and compares it to its training data of\nbullying or harassing messages. Messages deemed potentially harassing or\nharmful can then be sent to an HR manager for review, although Nex AI has not\nrevealed the specific terms that the bot looks for across communications it\nanalyzes.\n\nOther startups have also created AI-powered harassment detection tools. The AI\nstartup Spot owns a chatbot that is capable of enabling employees to\nanonymously report allegations of sexual harassment. The bot will ask\nquestions and give advice in order to collect more details and further an\ninvestigation into the incident. Spot wants to help HR teams deal with\nharassment issues in a sensitive manner while still ensuring anonymity is\npreserved.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, Prof. Brian Subirana, MIT and Harvard AI professor,\nexplained that attempts to use AI to detect harassment have their limitations.\nHarassment can be very subtle and hard to pick up, frequently manifesting\nitself only as a pattern that reveals itself when examining weeks of data.\nBots also can\u2019t, as of yet, go beyond the detection of certain trigger words\nand analyze the broader interpersonal or cultural dynamics that could\npotentially be at play. Despite the complexities of detecting harassment,\nSubirana does believe that bots could play a role in combating online\nharassment. Subirana could see the bots being used to train people to detect\nharassment when they see it, creating a database of potentially problematic\nmessages. Subirana also stated that there could be a placebo effect that makes\npeople less likely to harass their colleagues even they suspect their messages\nmay be being scrutinized, even if they aren\u2019t.\n\nWhile Subirana does believe that bots have their potential uses in combating\nharassment, Subirana also argued that confidentiality of data and privacy is a\nmajor concern. Subirana states that such technology could potentially create\nan atmosphere of distrust and suspicion if misused. Sam Smethers, the chief\nexecutive of women\u2019s rights NGO the Fawcett Society, also expressed concern\nabout how the bots could be misused. Smethers stated:\n\n\u201cWe would want to look carefully at how the technology is being developed, who\nis behind it, and whether the approach taken is informed by a workplace\nculture that is seeking to prevent harassment and promote equality, or whether\nit is in fact just another way to control their employees.\u201d\n\nMethods of using bots to detect harassment and still protect anonymity and\nprivacy will have to be worked out between bot developers, companies, and\nregulators. Some possible methods of utilizing the predictive power of bots\nand AI while still safeguarding privacy include keeping communications\nanonymous. For instance, reports could be generated by the bot that only\nincludes the presence of potentially harmful language and counts of how often\nthe possibly harassing language appears. HR could then get an idea if uses of\ntoxic language are dropping following awareness seminars, or conversely could\ndetermine if they should be on the lookout for increased harassment.\n\nDespite the disagreement over appropriate uses of [machine\nlearning](https://www.unite.ai/what-is-machine-learning/) algorithms and bots\nin detecting harassment, both sides seem to agree that the ultimate decision\nto get intervene in cases of harassment should be by a human, and that bots\nshould only ever alert people to matched patterns rather than saying\ndefinitively that something was an instance of harassment.\n\nSpread the love\n\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n  *  __\n\n[ Continue Reading](https://www.unite.ai/startups-creating-ai-tools-to-detect-\nemail-harassment/)\n\n### [Cybersecurity](https://www.unite.ai/cybersecurity/)\n\n# AI Security Monitoring & Job Recruitment Companies Raise Funds\n\n![mm](https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Ljubinko-150x150.jpg)\n\nPublished\n\n6 months ago\n\non\n\nOctober 12, 2019\n\nBy\n\n[Ljubinko Zivkovic](https://www.unite.ai/author/ljubinko/ \"Posts by Ljubinko\nZivkovic\") [ __](https://twitter.com/zivljub)\n\n![AI Security Monitoring & Job Recruitment Companies Raise\nFunds](https://www.unite.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/funding.jpg)\n\n[VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com) reports on two new high fundings for\nstartups developing artificial intelligence.

[UCV raised $8 million](https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/08/umbo-\ncomputer-vision-raises-8-million-for-ai-powered-video-security/) for its Ai-\npowered video security, while [Xor managed to raise $8.4\nmillion](https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/11/xor-raises-8-4-million-for-ai-\npowered-job-candidate-recruitment-and-screening/) for its project.\n\nXor\u2019s capital infusion came after a year in which the startup tripled its\nsales in the US, \u201creaching $2 million in annual recurring revenue and closing\ndeals with over 100 customers in 15 countries, including ExxonMobil, Ikea,\nBaxter Personnel, Heineken, IBS, Aldi, Hoff, McDonald\u2019s, and Mars.\u201d As the\ncompany co-founder and CEO Aida Fazylova explains, she \u201cstarted the company to\nlet recruiters focus on the human touch \u2014 building relationships, interviewing\ncandidates, and attracting the best talent to their companies. Meanwhile, AI\ntakes care of repetitive tasks and provides 24/7 personalized service to every\ncandidate. We are proud to get support from SignalFire and other amazing\ninvestors who help us drive our mission to make the recruitment experience\nbetter and more transparent for everyone.\u201d\n\nXor\u2019s chatbot \u201cautomates tedious job recruitment tasks, like scheduling\ninterviews; sorting applications; and responding to questions via email, text,\nand messaging apps like Facebook Messenger and Skype. The eponymous Xor \u2014\nwhich is hosted on Microsoft\u2019s Azure \u2014 draws on over 500 sources for suitable\ncandidates and screens those candidates autonomously, leveraging 103 different\nlanguages and algorithms trained on 17 different HR and recruitment data\nsets.\u201d\n\nAccording to [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com), the\nchatbot market is expected to reach $1.23 billion by 2025, while\n[Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en) predicts that chatbots will power 85% of\nall customer service interactions by the year 2020.\n\nFor its part, Umbo develops \u201c software, hardware, and AI smarts that can\ndetect and identify human behaviors related to security, such as intrusion,\ntailgating (when an unauthorized individual follows someone into private\npremises), and wall-scaling.\u201d\n\nThe company says it has developed its AI systems entirely in-house, and their\nsystem incorporates three components.\u201c[AiCameras](https://umbocv.ai/AiCameras)\nare built in-house and feature built-in AI chips, connecting directly to the\ncloud to bypass servers and video recording intermediates, such as\n[NVRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_video_recorder) or\n[DVRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder).\n[Light](https://umbocv.ai/umbo_light) is AI-powered software for detecting and\nissuing alerts on human-related security actions.\u201d There is also\n\u201c[TruePlatform](https://umbocv.ai/trueplatform), a centralized platform where\nbusinesses can monitor and manage all their cameras, users, and security\nevents.\u201d As Shawn Guan, Umbo\u2019s cofounder and CEO points out, the company\nlaunched Umbo Light, \u201cwhich implemented feedback that we gathered from our\ncustomers about what their primary wants from video security systems were.\nThis allowed us to design and deliver a system based on the needs of those who\nuse it most.\u201d\n\nThe global video surveillance market, which is now practically relying on the\nuse of AI, was pegged at $28 billion in 2017 and is [expected to\ngrow](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/video-surveillance-market-to-\nreach-87-36-bn-globally-by-2025-at-14-2-cagr-allied-market-\nresearch-300880816.html) to more than $87 billion by

which streamlines video\nrecruiting.\n\nBy: [HRE Editorial Staff](https://hrexecutive.com/author/hre-editorial-staff/\n\"Posts by HRE Editorial Staff\") | September 24, 2019 \u2022 1 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hpb/hpb-top-stories/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/102019_3_HRtech_Amplify-700x624.jpg)\n\n_Human Resource Executive_ \u00ae\u2019s Top HR Products contest spotlights 10 of the\nmost innovative new solutions on the market that are helping business leaders\nmeet the ever-evolving HR needs of their organizations.\n\nHere\u2019s one of this year\u2019s winners:\n\n### [![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-Top-HR-\nProduct-Sealo-250x250.jpg)](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/2019-Top-HR-Product-Sealo.jpg)Amplify VMS\n\n[**SparcStart**](http://sparcstart.com/amplify)\n\n**What It Is:** Amplify is a one-stop shop for recruitment videos. As video\ngains traction in the recruiting space, Amplify aims to help organizations\nstreamline processes for creating, sharing, distributing and cataloguing\nvideos. It is the only solution of its kind that allows clients to both upload\nexisting content and create their own on the platform\u2014and is also the only\nthat does not rely on an app. Unlike YouTube hosting\u2014where videos can be\nsidetracked by advertising and other obstacles\u2014Amplify hosts the content,\nwhich can be pushed through the creation, approval and distribution processes\nin just minutes.\n\n**Why We Like It:** Simple and quick are hallmarks of this product. When any\ntype of recruiting video is needed, recruiters can upload an existing video\ndirectly to the platform or invite an employee to record one with a simple\nemail request. With a single click, the employee uses a personal recording\ndevice to craft recruitment videos that they input directly into the system.\nThe videos do not save on the user\u2019s computer or phone\u2014cutting down on\ndisparate processes and privacy concerns. The system enables assigning\nsupervisors to approve or decline the content\u2014which can be a prime opportunity\nto work with recruiters on brand education\u2014and, if approved, the video can be\npushed directly to linked social-media accounts or generated into a link for\nemail distribution. Without needing much technical prowess or time investment,\nrecruiters can kickstart the hiring process, all while conveying a truer taste\nof the organization\u2019s culture than may be available in a written job summary.\nAdditionally, content\u2014both created in the system and inputted from other\nlocations\u2014is searchable and taggable on the back end, which can be a treasure\ntrove for organizations looking to delve more deeply into video recruiting.\n\n[**See the full list of winners here.**](https://hrexecutive.com/announcing-\nthe-2019-top-hr-products/)\n\n\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Ftop-\nhr-product-amplify-vms%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Top+HR+Product%3A+Amplify+VMS&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Ftop-\nhr-product-amplify-vms%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Ftop-\nhr-product-amplify-vms%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

clamoring for consumer-grade tech experiences at\nwork that also help them feel connected to their colleagues and organization.\n\nBy: [Andrew R. McIlvaine](https://hrexecutive.com/author/andrew-r-mcilvaine/\n\"Posts by Andrew R. McIlvaine\") | January 2, 2020 \u2022 6 min read\n\nTopics: [Employee\nRecognition](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/employee-\nrecognition/) |\n[Engagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/engagement/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) |\n[Recognition](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/recognition/)\n| [Retention](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/retention/) |\n[Talent Management](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hpb/hpb-top-stories/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Talent-Board-\nart-700x450.jpg)\n\nEmployee experience has a number of dimensions, all of which employers need to\npay attention to.\n\nThe words \"employee experience\" have become the hottest buzzword in HR these\ndays, and for good reason, says Josh Bersin.\n\n\"We're not building software for HR anymore\u2014we're building it for employees,\"\nthe global industry analyst said during his opening keynote at this year's [HR\nTechnology Conference](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/select-\nhr-tech-conference-news/) in Las Vegas. \"If employees don't find it useful, if\nit doesn't fit into 'the flow of work,' then it's not going to be used.\"\n\nA recent survey from Gartner of 5,000 employees finds that 56% agree with this\nstatement: \"I expect to have the same quality experience at work as I do as a\ncustomer.\"\n\nCompanies are shifting their focus to addressing the full employee experience,\ncognizant that they have the same wants, needs and desires as customers, says\nLauren Mason, principal in Mercer's career business.\n\n\"Companies that figure out how to make their employees' experience as\ndelightful as their customers' experience will have a competitive advantage,\"\nshe says.\n\nEmployee experience isn't just about providing a consumer-grade experience\nwith HR technology, says Bersin. It's also about ensuring that in today's\noften-fragmented organizations, employees feel connected to their work and\ntheir colleagues, understand the organization's mission and their place in it\nand can easily find the information they need for tasks ranging from making\nbenefits choices to furthering their development.\n\nThis has given rise to what he labels \"employee experience platforms.\"\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n**Related** : [This is why you have to take employee experience\nseriously](https://hrexecutive.com/this-is-why-you-have-to-take-employee-\nexperience-seriously/)\n\n\u201cVendors like ServiceNow, Deloitte, Mercer, SAP SuccessFactors, IBM, all have\nplatforms focused on the employee experience,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect out-\nof-the box ERP to do this. This is going to be a significant market.\"\n\nAlthough organizations tend to prefer a single HCM system of record, it's\ndifficult to keep all of that data in one place, Bersin wrote in a report\nearlier this year. \"This means we need a set of software to deliver a single\nuser interface; something that lets us build employee journeys, develop apps,\ncreate and monitor workflows, and add chatbots and other forms of\nconversational interfaces to the mix.\"\n\n**Pulling Together Information**\n\nMany so-called employee experience platforms are designed to help employees\nmore easily find information and complete tasks that they'd otherwise have to\nturn to an HR representative or service center for assistance with.\n\n\"We see organizations wanting to provide an experience where employees can\naddress problems themselves or deal with a major life event without having to\nreach out to someone for help,\" says Bill Docherty, managing director in\ncharge of Deloitte's ConnectMe platform.\n\n\"The real genesis is the recognition that employees today are digital\nconsumers,\" he says. \"The bring that same expectation to the workplace.\"\n\nConnectMe is a digital employee experience platform for service delivery, says\nDocherty. \"Our clients use it for communicating major events, such as a\ntransformation the organization is undergoing. It's also used to help\nemployees address major life events, such as getting married or going on a\nleave of absence.\"\n\nMajor HCM platforms such as those offered by ADP and Workday are good at\ntransactional services but not so good at helping employees quickly find\nrelevant information that requires interaction with multiple systems, he says.\nConnectMe is designed to serve as an interface between different systems to\nprovide a more user-friendly experience, says Docherty.\n\nServiceNow, a large vendor with over 10,000 employees, started off in IT\nservice delivery and expanded into HR service delivery four years ago. It uses\nnatural language processing to power a virtual agent that enables \"an\nomnichannel experience for the employee,\" says Blake McConnell, senior vice\npresident of employee workflows.\n\nDeepak Bharadwaj, vice president of ServiceNow's HR Business Unit, joined the\ncompany four years ago from Taleo.\n\n\"The charter I was given was how to take our platform and make it valuable and\nrelevant to HR,\" he says. \"The surge of interest in 'employee experience' over\nthe last five years meshes nicely with the things we're able to help clients\nwith.\"\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nServiceNow's platform is designed to make it easy for employees and managers\nquickly find needed information, says Bharadwaj. \"When you're confronted with\na situation like jury duty or there's a paycheck error or you've got a new\nhire to bring on, you're often lost as to what to do,\" he says. \"Our aim is to\nguide them through what could be fairly complex processes, ensure they have\naccess to the right information and proactively give them information before\nthey even ask for it.\"\n\n**Big \"E\" Versus Small \"e\"**\n\nWhen it comes to employee experience, Chris Pinc says, there's a difference\nbetween \"small 'e'\" employee experience and \"big 'e' \" employee experience.\n\nSmall 'e' refers to the consumer-grade experience employees tend to expect now\nwith workplace technology, he says. However, the big 'E' is what's really\nimportant.\n\n\"That's much more about whether employees feel their experience is\ninspirational to them: Are they inspired by their organization, do they feel\nlike it's winning in the marketplace?\" says Pinc, managing director of product\nmanagement at Willis Towers Watson's talent reward business. \"If you can\ndeliver that big E experience, that's what really drives the bottom line.\"\n\nA positive big E experience is more directly correlated to better customer\nservice, improved sales and top-line revenue growth and reduced costs, he\nsays. It's much more than, say, just providing a good experience via a smooth\npayroll transaction, he adds.\n\n\"Big E describes things like opportunities to grow and reach your full\npotential, to make decisions and innovate and to be part of a winning team,\"\nsays Pinc. \"But if you merely describe employee experience from a\ntransactional viewpoint, then all you're doing is just using a buzzword to\njump on the bandwagon.\"\n\nHR, not IT or finance, is the best \"owner\" for driving and improving Big E\nexperience, he says. \"HR's in the best position to do two things: one,\nunderstand what employees care about and what they want from work, and two,\nunderstand how the organization can improve those moments that matter.\"\n\nIf you don't have both sides of that equation, says Pinc, then you won't be\nsuccessful in improving the \"big E\" experience.\n\nWillis Towers Watson offers an employee experience platform that's focused\nprimarily on the communication side of things, he says.\n\n\"Ours is focused on driving the right behaviors within an organization and\ncommunicating in a personalized way to employees,\" says Pinc.\n\nClients can use the platform to create and deliver \"rich content,\" including\nimages and videos, that's branded to their company, he says. WTW's employee-\nsurvey capabilities are considered part of the platform as well.\n\n**Related:** [The 6 key elements of employee\nexperience](https://hrexecutive.com/the-6-key-elements-of-employee-\nexperience/)\n\n\"In order to deliver the right messages to employees, you first need to\nunderstand what it is that employees care about,\" says Pinc. \"It's integration\nbetween feedback and listening on one hand and communicating and nudging on\nthe other.\"\n\nClients use the platform to help guide employees through a merger, find new\ncareers or develop skills in their current one and learn more about the\ncompany's benefits offerings, he says.\n\nThey also use it to help employees understand their role in helping the\norganization move forward.\n\n\"You need to be crystal clear to employees on how what they do contributes to\nthe big picture while giving them the freedom to help drive that\ntransformation,\" says Pinc.\n\nOne healthcare system client uses the platform to deliver personalized\nmessages to employees based on their roles. Cleaning staff, for example, will\nsee regular reminders of how their job helps prevent patient infections by\nkeeping hospital rooms clean.\n\n\"It's the first thing they see when they log in in the morning and it\nreinforces to them the critical role they play in making a difference in\npatients' lives,\" he says.\n\n**Driving Change**\n\nA poor onboarding experience or a merger/acquisition can undermine employee\nexperience, says Keith Kitani, CEO and co-founder of GuideSpark.\n\n\"Mergers and acquisitions are kind of like a huge onboarding task,\" he says.\n\"Sure, there's some process, but a lot of it is alignment around culture,\nstrategy, organization and rewards. 83% of mergers fail, and half of them do\nso because of people-related issues.\"\n\nGuideSpark's platform lets companies create sustained employee-communication\nstrategies that can help HR leaders boost engagement during an M&A or support\na major new process, such as a revamped performance-management process, says\nKitani.\n\nKitani, who started a tech firm that was eventually acquired by Adobe Systems\nand is now called Adobe Connect, launched GuideSpark in 2008 to help companies\ncreate video and mobile versions of their print communications.\n\n\"Eventually we realized it's not just about creating a great content\nexperience but, how do you actually reach and engage employees in a world\nthat's increasingly noisy?\" he says.\n\nThe result was its GuideSpark Communication Cloud product, which is designed\nto drive change or adoption around key strategic programs via communication.\n\n\"Communication is a challenge for most organizations,\" says Kitani.\n\nOne client, a Fortune 20 company, wanted to overhaul its 20-year old\nperformance management process. Considering that it had 60,000 employees\nscattered around the globe, this would be no easy task.\n\n\"They realized that they needed to drive adoption throughout the entire\norganization, so they charted out a three-year plan to reach all the different\ngroups within the company,\" he says.\n\nThe company used Communication Cloud to create campaigns with different\nmessages and delivery mechanisms for each group. The campaign included\ninformation on why the new PM system was important and how it worked. The\nmaterial was reinforced and supplemented with short-form content to guide the\nemployees through the process.\n\n\"Changing behavior takes time\u2014it's about measuring and iterating,\" says\nKitani.\n\nOptimal employee experiences can't be created in a vacuum, says Pinc.\n\n\"Everything HR does can be done better with the right technology and by\nlistening to employees,\" he says.\n\nAndrew R.

Best](http://hrmasia.com/category/regular-features/five-of-the-\nbest/) is a weekly series highlighting the best HR service providers across\nSingapore and the Southeast Asia region. It is brought to you by\n[www.hrmasia.com](http://www.hrmasia.com/)._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/HRIS-79466851_m-1.jpg)\n\nThere\u2019s simply no way to overstate the value of a good HR Information System\nto any employing organisation. With some of the key touchpoints between staff,\nand across levels, it is the lifeblood of not just the HR team, but the entire\norganisation as a whole.\n\nOf course, it needs to be functional. And for many years, this was the only\nconsideration HR leaders had in choosing a system (or different modules) to\nimplement. As long as the payroll was delivered on time and accurately, and\nexpense claims were able to be examined, the system was said to be doing its\njob.\n\nBut these days, HR leaders are seeing the opportunities and risks within each\ntechnological solution they consider. They know that tech that isn\u2019t fully\nembraced by the workforce can impact retention, which means user experience\nhas become a vital point of difference.\n\nHere are five of the best service providers in this category:\n\n### JUZ TALENT\n\n**[www.juztalent.com](http://www.juztalent.com)**\n\n**+65 6384 3808**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JuzTalent-\nimage-250x175.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JuzTalent-\nimage.jpg)When businesses are considering investing in a workforce or payroll\nsolution, they\u2019ll likely begin to think about cost-effectiveness, automation,\nand value creation.

In fact, when Human Resources Online asked HR leaders to rate the\nimportance of employee health and wellbeing on a scale of one to 10, we\nreceived an average rating of nine.\n\nBut, today, health and wellness goes beyond physical wellbeing. It also\ninvolves mental, financial, career, and social aspects.\n\nMohamad Roslan Bin Mohamad Nasir, Senior General Manager \u2013 Corporate, Denso\nMalaysia, reveals that his company, the supplier of advanced automotive\ntechnology, systems and components, is in the midst of planning for a full\nemployee wellness package.\n\n\u201cThe management is very supportive to embark on employee health and\nwellbeing,\u201d he said. Even though the firm is still at the benchmarking stage\nof the programme, Denso has various employee engagement initiatives that aid\nin staff wellness. For instance, a stress management programme for mental\nwellbeing and a consistent sports programme that helps with physical wellness.\n\nFor career and social wellness, the firm has a strong engagement programme\nthat looks at employee career movement within the company, and regionally, as\nwell as CSR programmes related to sustainable development. With many more\nelements of wellness to consider, in the following pages, we uncover how\norganisations are designing truly holistic wellbeing programmes through a\nseries of case studies.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-icon-\noffshore-is-achieving-employee-wellbeing-by-doing-more-with-less/): How Icon\nOffshore is doing more with less\n\nOn a scale of one to 10, employee wellbeing is a 10 for offshore support\nvessel provider, Icon Offshore. Despite being faced with financial constraints\ndue to a slowdown in the oil and gas industry, when it comes to health and\nwellness programmes, Kamarunnihar Abdul Samad, General Manager, Human\nResources, Icon Offshore, reveals a holistic view is taken.\n\nWhile Icon Offshore does not tick all five boxes of mental, physical,\nfinancial, career, and social, the initiatives it has introduced are very\ninterlinked, combining two or more aspects of wellness.\n\n> ##### With the slowdown in the oil and gas sector in recent years, with all\n> our staff activities, we are trying to do more with less.\n\nFor instance, to encourage financial wellbeing, a financial talk was held in\nJuly 2019 where staff were given practical financial advice and were able to\nask questions.\n\n\u201cBecause of the overall downturn in the global oil and gas sector, we are\nunable to pay very competitive salaries. So, we embarked on this talk to help\nour staff by giving them someone who can advise them on how best they can save\nfor the future.\u201d\n\nThe HR team is also working on a talk on how to prevent falling victim to\nfraud, which will be launched in Q3 2019.\n\nApart from improving financial wellbeing, the talks also help with mental\nwellbeing, she says, noting that \u201cif a person has issues with their finances,\nit\u2019s probably going to affect their mental health as well\u201d.\n\nThe initiative she is most proud of is the staff activities, which include\nindoor and outdoor games that not only get staff moving, but also provides an\nopportunity for them to socialise within the organisation.\n\n> ##### The outdoor games include badminton, futsal, and walk-a-hunt \u2013 a\n> treasure hunt that involves walking around town. While the indoor games\n> include charades, darts, and board games such as Scrabble.\n\n\u201cFor these games, the staff are divided into three groups. Each group has\nabout 20 to 25 people and includes a number of departments, a gender balance,\nand various levels. Even the big boss has to play. We encourage the younger\nstaff to be the leaders of the group so we can share leadership advice with\nthem informally,\u201d she says.\n\nThe first time the games were rolled out 2017, a town hall was held to explain\nto employees how the games would work. The second time, a general announcement\nwas made and the team leaders were contacted to disseminate the information.\n\nTo encourage participation, the game rules are that each person has to play at\nleast one game. Otherwise, points will be deducted from the team. At the end\nof the set of games, the winning team will get a monetary reward which they\ncan use to buy lunch or something else for each team member.\n\nWhile the returns on wellness are difficult to quantify, Kamarunnihar has a\npositive anecdote to share.\n\n> ##### The first time the games were introduced, two people actually changed\n> their mind about resigning, despite being offered a much higher salary at\n> the other organisation. When I asked why, they shared that the activities\n> had helped them feel like the company (here) is a family and that they might\n> not get the same experience there.\n\nThe number one thing HR should keep in mind when implementing such programmes?\n\u201cSafety is always number one.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-fostering-an-\nenvironment-that-prioritises-wellbeing-at-aberdeen-standard-investments/):\nFostering an environment that prioritises wellbeing at Aberdeen Standard\nInvestments\n\nAberdeen Standard Investments (Asia) is fully committed to providing employees\nwith a work environment that supports their overall wellbeing.\n\nTay Kheng-Guet, Head of Human Resources \u2013 Asia Pacific, Aberdeen Standard\nInvestments, says: \u201cWe have a corporate wellness strategy which is part of the\nAPAC HR strategy on diversity and inclusion. The strategy emphasises fostering\na work environment that prioritises employee wellbeing, valuing diversity, as\nwell as building inclusion and social engagement. Broadening the perspective\nof wellness, there is also a talent and career development strategy which\nguides the development of employees.\u201d\n\nThe APAC strategy has three prongs which include workplace support initiatives\nthat aim to protect employees\u2019 holistic wellbeing in the midst of changes and\nchallenges through three aspects:\n\n  * Agile working and flexible work arrangements which provide employees with flexible autonomy, allowing them to work smarter and more efficiently, which helps them to achieve a work-life balance.\n  * Work-life coaches (employee assistance programmes) which is a confidential service aimed at assisting employees on issues that are work-related, personal, legal, financial, as well as in transitions. Employees can have access to five work-life coaching sessions per year across 10 APAC locations. Coaches can support the diverse language requirements in all locations as well.\n  * Wellness initiatives that go beyond the usual health screenings.\n\nOn the wellness initiatives, Tay says:\n\n> ##### We have a comprehensive wellness calendar in place for the whole year\n> \u2013 covering monthly talks and activities in accordance with quarterly themes\n> of heart (emotional wellness), mind (personal effectiveness), body (physical\n> wellness) and spirit (mental wellness).\n\nApart from the monthly activities, on 31 July 2019, Aberdeen Standard\nInvestments held its inaugural ASI Health & Wellness Day where a whole day was\ndedicated to celebrating employees\u2019 wellbeing. Activities for the event\nincluded terrarium building, ergonomics awareness, aromatherapy sessions, and\nmass yoga conducted across three countries.\n\n\u201cThe event is a summer interns-led wellness project aimed at supporting our\nongoing effort to promote health and wellness. Our goal is to encourage all\nemployees to prioritise and take charge of their health amid their busy\nschedules and achieve a work-life balance.\u201d\n\nA variety of activities were planned to educate and cater to individuals\u2019\ninterests and needs \u2013 from an ergonomics talk addressing the importance of\nproper posture in alleviating common aches and pains resulting from prolonged\nsitting, to a yoga hour to help employees achieve mental wellness through\nmindful meditation.\n\n\u201cWe also had a terrarium-making workshop with MINDS to reduce stress and\nsharpen mental focus; as well as an aromatherapy session to help employees\nunderstand the tremendous benefits in helping one to relax and improve their\nmood,\u201d she adds.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-british-\namerican-tobacco-singapore-reduced-absenteeism-by-23/): How British American\nTobacco Singapore empowers staff to take charge of their wellbeing\n\nHaving been established for more than a century, British American Tobacco\n(BAT) is well-known for taking care of employee welfare. It constantly\nmeasures itself against the market and adapts practices to cater to employees\nthrough time and demographic-relevant solutions.\n\nMausami Arora, Head of HR, British American Tobacco Singapore, says: \u201cAt BAT\nSingapore, we are very diverse, with 24 nationalities, a multi-generational\nworkforce and functional breadth. Hence, it becomes imperative to have a\nholistic approach centred around our employees that has both buy-in and\nimpact.\u201d\n\n> ##### We take employee feedback very seriously and we continue to push the\n> envelope to make BAT Singapore a great place to work.\n\nThe organisation has a spectrum of programmes covering the five key aspects of\nwellness. This includes workshops to raise awareness on mental wellness and\nstress management, as well as those focused on savings and retirement\nplanning.\n\nApart from the mental and financial aspects, on the social front, BAT has an\nemployee-led and run sports and social committee which organises events such\nas Family Day, Durian Day, Sports Day, Dinner and Dance, and more. For the\ncareer aspect, the firm strongly believes in growth from within and invests\nheavily in employee development across all grades.\n\nFalling largely under the physical area of wellness, BAT launched an Active360\nhealth and wellness programme in January 2019. The programme seeks to appeal\nto different generations, empower them to take charge of their wellbeing\nthrough various preventive initiatives, and encourage a healthy lifestyle\namong employees.\n\nExplaining the rationale behind this new programme, Arora says: \u201cWhen we\nanalysed our inpatient and outpatient data, we realised the trend was\nreflective of national health concerns around hypertension, diabetes and\ncholesterol. We tend to spend 75% of our waking hours at work and there is a\nconstant blurring between work and life. Hence, at BAT Singapore, we wanted to\ncreate a preventive culture of health and wellness.\u201d\n\nAfter obtaining buy-in from top management and senior stakeholders, the health\nand wellness programme was rolled out with a wellness party to coincide with\nthe launch of the National Corporate Steps Challenge, Season 4.\n\n> ##### An activity plan for the entire year was mapped out, with weekly\n> recurring activities that are relatable, meaningful, impactful, and\n> amplifying.\n\n\u201cActivities include Yoghurt Mondays, Fruity Tuesdays, Salad Wednesdays and De-\nStress Thursdays which are intended to continuously engage the employees and\nraise awareness on healthy eating and mental wellbeing.\u201d In the middle of the\nyear, BAT followed up with a super healthy buffet day where employees were\nable to sample healthy and delicious dishes during lunch.\n\n\u201cA role model was also appointed to share how she achieved her desired weight\nand BMI by persevering with healthy eating habits. Overall, the event was very\nwell-received, and we got lots of positive feedback from the employees.\u201d\n\nTo measure programme success, BAT monitors the emerging trends across medical\nbills, absenteeism, health & safety, employee engagement scores, and employee\nuptake ratios.\n\n> ##### We are already seeing some early success, with absenteeism dropping by\n> 23% to date in 2019 versus the same period last year.\n\nRather than focusing on fixed targets which may end up killing the programme\nin its infancy, BAT looks to create a culture where employees are empowered to\nmake conscious choices towards their health goals, she concludes.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-taiyo-\nnippon-sanso-holdings-singapore-reduces-work-related-stress/): How Taiyo\nNippon Sanso Holdings Singapore reduces work-related stress\n\nWhile employee health and wellbeing is typically considered HR\u2019s\nresponsibility, the responsibility is shared between HR and the business at\nindustrial gas manufacturer, Taiyo Nippon Sanso Holdings Singapore.\n\nWith health and wellbeing being an underlying foundation for an effective\ntalent management strategy at the firm, Pauline Loo, Vice President, Human\nResource & Admin, Taiyo Nippon Sanso Holdings Singapore, says: \u201cIt is a shared\nresponsibility between HR professionals and business leaders to actively\nengage employees in a holistic manner, going beyond physical wellbeing.\u201d\n\nThe organisation has a plethora of initiatives covering the five aspects of\nwellness. In the area of physical wellness, it has the health and wellness\nclub (H&W) which started in April 2018. Comprising employee representatives\nfrom various divisions, including engineering and HR, the club rolls out\nmonthly health and wellness activities ranging from badminton sessions to\nbowling sessions, and even ice-skating sessions.\n\n> ##### \u201cThis year, starting from July and ending in September, for a period\n> of three months, the H&W club organised sports tournaments for our\n> employees,\u201d Loo adds.\n\nIn the area of financial wellness, as part of its HR Cares \u2013 Keep Our People\nInteractive quarterly seminar, speakers are invited to speak with employees on\nvarious wealth education series, ranging from will-writing to lasting power\nattorney.\n\nOn the social front, the company leverages on its Unity in Diversity campaign\nwhich started on 8 August 2018. The firm identified its first Unity in\nDiversity ambassador to promote D&I in social activities within the company\nand among the group\u2019s subsidiaries.\n\n\u201cA Unity in Diversity video was produced in June 2019 to showcase the spirit\nof embracing unity despite differences between the Japan head office and the\nSingapore regional headquarters. We are also working on a Unity in Diversity\nvideo for the Southeast Asia region.\u201d\n\nIn the area of career wellness, it has implemented two competency models \u2013 the\nManaging Self and Leading Others model and a Human Resource competency model.\nThe two models were designed and developed from April 2019 to ensure\nconsistent talent management practices across Southeast Asia, and India. \u201cThis\nhelps integrate talent practices, for example, ensuring that rewards are tied\nto performance, and performance is tied to development.\u201d\n\n> ##### To ensure mental wellness, one of the 10 core general competencies in\n> the Managing Self and Leading Others competency model is around time and\n> stress management.\n\n\u201cIncorporating \u2018time and stress management\u2019 as one of the ten core general\ncompetencies helps create awareness among the employees that effective time\nmanagement enables them to deliver their work assignments in an efficient\nmanner and reduce unnecessary work-related stress. \u201cIn this way, the employees\nmanage themselves better in terms of striking a better work-life balance and\noverall mental wellbeing.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Loo shares that time and stress management was the first core general\ncompetency shared with employees in the inaugural run of HR Cares Brown Bag\nseminars.\n\nAsked about measuring the ROI on wellness, Loo reveals she plans to measure it\nthrough employee engagement analytics.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-fave-\nkeeps-employee-health-wellness-in-check/): A range of wellness activities at\nFave\n\nWhile online-to-offline commerce platform Fave does not have special\ninitiatives parked under each aspect of wellness, the organisation organises a\nrange of activities, says Anisha Sasheendran, Regional Head of People, Fave.\n\nTo promote physical wellness, the firm organises post-work exercise classes\nthroughout the week.\n\n> ##### \u201cWe have Yoga Mondays, Futsal Tuesdays, Badminton Wednesdays, and\n> Zumba Thursdays. We also have free health checks and talks from time to\n> time,\u201d she says.\n\nOn the financial front, with the average age of Fave\u2019s employees being 27,\nmany are interested in wealth and financial management, she observes. In line\nwith that, the organisation hosts talks and workshops with external partners\nfrom time to time.\n\nIn an effort to support employees\u2019 mental wellness, while Fave does not have\nexperts within the company, it provides contacts to organisations/ experts\nthat are trained to help individuals who need assistance.\n\n\u201cWe have also given time off to some employees that were pre-\ndiagnosed/diagnosed with some sort of mental condition. This really helped\nthem rejuvenate. Some are back now and doing great stuff within the\norganisation.\u201d\n\n> ##### On the career front, Fave has mentorship programmes, internal job\n> rotation opportunities, and one-to-one career chats for employees who are\n> keen to know more about their career growth.\n\nTo provide opportunities for employees to socialise, Fave has various social\nevents in and out of the office which employees are occasionally able to bring\ntheir family and friends to attend.\n\nApart from that, she says: \u201cWe host external events at the office and\nencourage our employees to attend networking and external sessions outside the\noffice as well. We also established a learning fund which employees can use to\nlearn something new \u2013 from attending conferences abroad to even taking a\nKorean class.\u201d\n\nThe initiatives are communicated to staff via Fave\u2019s monthly/quarterly all-\nhands sessions as well as via email, and effectiveness is gauged through pulse\nsurvey scores.\n\n* * *\n\n### [Case study](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-urbanfoxs-\nbroad-spectrum-of-health-and-wellness-initiatives/): UrbanFox\u2019s broad spectrum\nof health and wellness initiatives\n\nEmployee wellbeing is of utmost importance to UrbanFox, a B2B2C logistics\nenabler that is a subsidiary of Keppel Logistics.\n\n**Abeline Kok, HR Team Lead at UrbanFox** , shares that the organisation\nundertakes a broad spectrum of health and wellness initiatives to support the\nphysical, mental, financial, career, and social wellbeing of its employees.\n\nOn the physical aspect, she says: \u201cWe have mobile massages for our employees\nat least once a month. Employees register for the massages; each session lasts\nabout 20 minutes.\u201d\n\n> ##### The massages are also part of UrbanFox\u2019s CSR efforts as the firm\n> engages the mobile massage team from the Singapore Association of the\n> Visually Handicapped.\n\nOther initiatives for physical wellness include high intensity interval\ntraining workshops once to twice a month, and complimentary health screenings\nfor employees.\n\nOn the mental aspect, UrbanFox organises lunchtime talks on mental wellness,\nas well holds staff engagement sessions.\n\n\u201cThe engagement sessions support mental wellbeing by providing employees with\na platform for them to share their feelings and provide feedback.\u201d\n\nIn addition, lunchtime talks are also held to promote financial wellness.\nTopics for the talks include personal financial planning as well as sharing on\nCPF and MediSave policies and schemes.\n\nTo ensure career wellness, UrbanFox has career discussions with high potential\nemployees. \u201cDuring these sessions, we will discuss their career goals,\u201d Kok\nsays. She adds that mentors are also assigned to high potentials.\n\nElaborating on other employee development and growth initiatives, she notes:\n\n> ##### We work with Workforce Singapore to conduct skills profiling workshops\n> for our employees. We also have quarterly appraisals where supervisors speak\n> to teams about their performance and careers.\n\nOn the social front, UrbanFox has a plethora of initiatives to encourage staff\nbonding. The firm organises family day events, festive celebrations, as well\nas team building sessions every year.\n\n\u201cWe also have activities which are staff-initiated. Employees with similar\ninterests will create a chat group on Google Hangouts and organise get-\ntogether sessions. We have chat groups for bowling, rock climbing, board\ngaming, KTV, and more,\u201d she says.\n\nThe initiative under the social umbrella which she is most proud of, is the\nFoxlympics, a sports and games event that runs across the entire year. The\ninitiative started in 2018 and is now in its second run.\n\nIt comprises competitions in foosball, table tennis, darts, Jenga, and\nScrabble. Staff are grouped into divisions which compete against each other.\nEach division will consist of a few departments to facilitate inter-department\ninteractions. At the end of the year, a trophy will be given to the division\nwith the most points.\n\n> ##### Senior management is supportive because it sees that sports and games\n> contribute to the physical and mental wellness of the employees.\n\nIn addition, bonds between colleagues have strengthened over the friendly\ncompetitions.\n\n\u201cThe turnout for the event has been good and there has been positive feedback\nthrough various channels, including employee surveys and monthly round tables\nwith the Managing Director. We also encourage staff to share feedback on\nGlassdoor. Since it is anonymous, the feedback should be pretty honest,\u201d she\nsays.\n\n* * *\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/10115352/HRSG-Sep-Oct-2019-Health-Wellness-feature-\ninfographic.jpg)\n\n_This feature was published in[Human Resources\u2019 September-October 2019\nedition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of the Singapore\nmagazine._\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/03161518/hrsg_sep-oct19.jpg)\n\n_Photos / provided  \nImage/ [iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/)_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

Adopt These Cutting-edge Recruitment Software Innovations**\n  * **Choosing Wisely in a Crowded Digital Marketplace**\n\n## **What Is Recruitment Software Technology?**\n\nRecruitment technology is defined as a set of tools used to automate the\nhiring process, connecting with a variety of data sources to access the best\nquality candidates. It performs key functions such as screening applicants,\nstreamlining follow-ups, and providing data on the efficiency of your\nrecruitment model.\n\nOver the last few years, the demand for recruitment software and tools has\nshot up dramatically as the labor market becomes fiercer and more complicated.\nCompanies are eager to hire highly skilled workers and drive business\ninnovation, even as the average tenure per employee continues to dip. In fact,\nglobal market research company Fortune Business Insights finds that the\nrecruitment software market will cross $3,000 million by 2025.\n\nInterestingly, recruitment doesn\u2019t always need to be a technology-driven\nprocess. However, if you\u2019re looking for high-quality talent that makes an\nexcellent culture fit, especially during a rapid growth phase, you will\nrequire recruitment software to achieve the right level of efficiency.\n\nRecruitment software doesn\u2019t just help you complete the formalities around\nhiring a candidate. It automates the entire recruitment pipeline right from\ncandidate sourcing and engagement to the final step of onboarding. That\u2019s why\nit has become a staple for the **[modern HR\ntoolkit](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/hr-\ntoolkit-of-the-future/)**.\n\n## **Four Features of Recruitment Software That Should Be on Your Checklist**\n\nGiven the highly crowded nature of the recruitment software marketplace, how\ndo you go about choosing one best suited to your enterprise? Are you aware of\nall the must-have features in any recruitment platform, and future trends in\nthis space?\n\nHere are a few key features that your recruitment software and tools should be\nable to perform:\n\n### **1\\. Plugging into a variety of data sources**\n\n  \nThe recruitment tool of your choice should be able to **integrate with the\nhighest possible number of data sources** , including social media, email, job\nboards, third-party staffing platforms, and several other **[talent\nsourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-talent-sourcing/)** areas. It should also come with the requisite sort-and-\nfilter capabilities to help find the right talent.\n\n### **2\\. Deploying recruitment marketing initiatives**\n\n  \nToday, attracting and retaining candidates closely resembles the process of\nattracting and retaining consumers. That\u2019s why it is a recruitment best\npractice to **approach the hiring process as a sales and marketing campaign**.\n\nRemember to check if a recruitment software supports email automation, job ads\npublishing, video communication, **[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/)** (CRM), and in-app\nmessaging to engage with applicants across the entire hiring journey.\n\n### **3\\. Shortlisting candidate profiles**\n\n  \nWith so many recommendations and leads flowing in from multiple sources, it\ncould be challenging to arrive at **an actionable list of candidates** \u2013 and\nthis is particularly true for bulk-hiring campaigns.\n\nRecruitment software should be able to build a searchable database of\napplicants, perform level-one resume screening, enable multi-channel\ncommunication within the platform, and aid your end-to-end selection process.\n\n### **4\\. Revealing insights into recruitment efficiency**\n\n  \nThis is one of the most significant advantages of using an analytics-driven\nrecruitment software versus legacy manual processes. The tool should be able\nto gather data across the recruitment pipeline to **extract useful insights,**\nsuch as which sourcing strategy is performing the best, whether your\ntime/cost-to-hire is sustainable, and key pain points in the **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**.\n\nOver time, this feature will ensure your recruitment function becomes smarter,\nmore effective, and ready to stand out in a competitive hiring arena.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve looked at the core features of recruitment software, let's turn\nthe spotlight on some of the most prominent players in this space and a few\ndisruptors that are making game-changing strides in recruitment software\ntechnology.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Candidate Screening and Selection Process: The Complete\nGuide for 2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-screening-and-selection/)\n\n## **The Best Recruitment Software and Tools for 2020**\n\nAs technology evolves in leaps and bounds, powerful software and cutting-edge\ninnovation aren\u2019t limited to large enterprises anymore. For example, Software-\nas-a-Service (SaaS) has made it possible to deploy recruitment tools on a pay-\nper-use model, scaling up or down as necessary. APIs also enable easier\nintegrations without any complex back-end development.\n\nAs a result, our list of the best recruitment software for 2020 is a mix of\nenterprise-grade tools as well as smartly designed products for small and\nmedium-sized businesses (SMBs). We have tried to cover the varying needs of\nbusinesses of multiple sizes, and every software has excellent online customer\nreviews. Remember, the best recruitment software for you will depend on your\nunique business requirements \u2013 that\u2019s why the numbering on this list doesn\u2019t\nreflect the ranking of a particular recruitment tool.\n\n![The best recruitment software to set you up for 2020 and\nbeyond](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1.

It plugs into social recruitment touchpoints to expand\nyour applicant base, its auto-extraction algorithm helps to upload and sort\nresumes in bulk, and there is a happierBOT to keep track of the tasks involved\nin the recruitment process.\n\nLike a lot of tools on this list, happierHire includes a built-in ATS to\nsimplify the candidate experience and integrates with a variety of sourcing\nplatforms.\n\nWhat makes happierHire a suitable tool for SMBs is probably its attractive\nprice point as well as a suite of optional add-ons like workflow automation,\nintranet, compensation, and compliance \u2013 designed for greater flexibility for\nsmall businesses.\n\n### **5\\.

an astonishing 99% of employees interested in remote work, you need a\nstate-of-the-art workplace messaging platform for easy collaboration. In\nconversation with Praveen Kanyadi from Groupe.io, we discuss:_**\n\n  * **_Why workplace messaging platforms are now invaluable_**\n  * **_Four messaging features that can simplify remote work_**\n  * **_Why AI could transform workplace messaging technology for good_**\n\n  \nThere\u2019s no stopping the remote working trend. According to Buffer\u2019s [State of\nRemote Work 2019 Report](https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2019), 99% of\nemployees are eager to work remotely at least some of the time. It offers\nseveral benefits, like flexibility in schedules, the ability to log-in from\nany locations, and better work-life balance.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d8220c81186d.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization\u2026.\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nBut it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. Buffer also found that collaboration and\ncommunication were among the top three challenges faced by remote workers. Why\nis this still a problem with companies embracing digital workplace messaging\nplatforms? Are these platforms ill-equipped to meet remote working needs?\n\nWe asked **Praveen Kanyadi, co-founder and VP Products of**[\n**Groupe.io**](https://www.groupe.io/), an employee communication app and\nproductivity platform, how next-gen workplace messaging platforms could ease\ncommunication for the remote workers. He had some interesting insights to\nshare.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **6 Tips to Simplify Life as a Remote Team\nManager**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/six-tips-\nto-simplify-your-life-as-a-remote-team-manager/)\n\n## **Why Workplace Messaging Platforms Are So Important for the Modern\nWorkplace**\n\nFor a long time, companies have relied on tools like Google Hangouts or even\nemail to communicate at work. However, as collaboration patterns start to\nchange, and workers from multiple locations join in, workplace messaging\nplatforms are expected to keep up. Today, technology helps to do much more\nthan just send an instant message:\n\n  * You can start a voice or video call right from the application without switching screens.\n  * File sharing is more robust, as workplaces messaging platforms integrate with other systems.\n  * Conversations are now omnichannel, with a seamless experience across devices.\n  * Real-time collaboration is a big part of workplace messaging, cutting across locational barriers.\n  * For admin, workplace messaging platforms can connect with other data sources to create a single source of truth.  \n\nKanyadi points out another recent advancement in this space: \u201cOne of the key\ntrends in the messaging space is the convergence of messaging, conferencing,\nand collaboration platforms. All the major players in this space are looking\nto further enhance capabilities in this area.\u201d\n\nSo, is your workplace messaging platform checking all the right boxes to\nenable communication for both on-premise and remote workers? Here are four\nfeatures to look for.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How Technology Is Transforming Workplace\nProductivity**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/how-\ntechnology-is-transforming-workplace-productivity/)\n\n## **4 Features That Mark a New Era in Workplace Messaging**\n\nA powerful messaging tool can help foster engagement among your workforce,\nensuring that everyone is on the same page. It is also integral if you\u2019re\nlooking to [enable collaborative\nleadership](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/preparing-for-the-\nfuture-of-work-first-embrace-collaborative-leadership-2/), allowing leaders to\nhave one-on-one conversations with different teams and individual employees.\n\nBut to achieve this, you need a workplace messaging platform that covers the\nneeds of a distributed workforce. Here are four features that can make it\nhappen:\n\n### **1\\. Native video conferencing, with low-bandwidth connection support**\n\n  \nEvery time a remote worker has to install a separate video conferencing app\nbefore joining a meeting, you\u2019re losing precious time and productivity. That\u2019s\nwhy your workplace messaging platform should come with video conferencing\ncapabilities out of the box. And, it should work despite the lack of high-\nspeed internet.\n\nAn overwhelming 37% of remote employees worked from coffee shops and\nrestaurants, found the Buffer report. Finding reliable Wi-Fi is among the top\nten challenges. To counter these challenges, workplace messaging platforms\nlike Slack are investing heavily in this space, adding to their native\ncapabilities. \u201cSlack recently announced a strategic partnership with Zoom\nvideo conferencing to further enhance their VC capabilities,\u201d says Kanyadi.\n\n### **2\\. Integration with productivity apps like Microsoft and G-Suite**\n\n  \nMicrosoft\u2019s Office 365 and Google\u2019s G-Suite are among the most popular\nproductivity apps out there. And they are both cloud-based, making it easy to\nintegrate with other online tools. Your remote workers should be able to open\na document right from your workplace messaging platform, share comments, and\nask for a response. This can go a long way in addressing the sense of\ndisconnect that may arise from not being present in the same office.\n\n\u201cMicrosoft Teams announced deeper integration between all the MSFT tools that\nthe remote workforce use (email, Skype, Teams, Yammer) to make it easier for\nemployees to switch between these solutions and share context,\u201d tells us\nKanyadi.\n\n### **3\\. Backend integrations to simplify admin processes**\n\n  \nAn excellent way to leverage messaging platforms for remote workforce\nmanagement is to link them to your HR and admin systems. For example, the\nplatform can extract employee records from the HRIS to create profiles for\neasy communication. The log-in data from a workplace messaging platform can\nfeed into payroll \u2013 the possibilities are endless, with a lot of potential in\nscenarios where your admin team can\u2019t keep a physical tab on workforce\nmovements.\n\n\u201cMessaging platforms are also improving integrations with enterprise systems,\nHRMS, and payroll systems to make it easy for remote workers to receive\ninformation directly in their streams and automate business processes,\u201d agrees\nKanyadi.\n\n### **4\\. AI capabilities to provide 360-degree context**\n\n  \nA vital element missing in distributed work scenarios is an accurate context\nfor every conversation. Employees aren\u2019t aware of every movement in the\noffice, making it difficult to contextualize information and decisions. Here\u2019s\nwhere artificial intelligence (AI) can come in. It can help to capture full-\nlength conversations regardless of where the employee is located.\n\n\u201cWebex acquired Voicea to bring voice transcription capabilities to its video\nconferencing. Voicea automatically takes meeting notes and summary through its\nspeech recognition capabilities,\u201d says Kanyadi. He also mentioned IBM\u2019s new\ninteractive whiteboard in partnership with Ricoh Europe that captures side\nconversations in addition to the primary speaker.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **5 Great Video Conferencing Tools for Small Businesses with\nRemote Employees**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/5-best-video-conferencing-tools-small-business-remote-\nemployees/)\n\n## **AI Could Shape the Future of Workplace Messaging Technology**\n\n[As your teams start working remotely, online collaboration becomes\ncrucial](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/as-your-\nteams-start-working-remotely-online-collaboration-becomes-crucial/). And a big\npart of driving collaboration among remote workers is having the right culture\nin place. AI can help circumvent the boundaries of location and language,\nallowing employees to bring their best to work.\n\n\u201cOut of sight is out of mind, and that is true to a large degree when it comes\nto the remote workforce,\u201d mentions Kanyadi. \u201cTime zone and language can limit\nthe effectiveness of messaging platforms. This is where AI can be very\nhelpful. While it\u2019s nearly impossible to have everyone present at all times,\nAI platforms are now able to provide the cognitive capabilities to capture\nconversations regardless of whether they are in-person or over any virtual\nmedium.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that [Slack is actively investing in AI](https://simply-\ncommunicate.com/slack-using-ai-improve-communication/), and Group.io features\nAI assistants to help connect the deskless workforce.\n\nThis is a great time to be a remote worker and even hire remote workers to\nmeet the talent shortage. But this is also precisely why companies working\nwith a sizeable remote workforce must offer the newest and the most effective\nmessaging platforms to help empower this thriving gig/remote economy.\n\n_Which workplace messaging platform would you recommend for remote workers?\nTell_ _us on_[ _Facebook_](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist/) _,_[\n_LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-technologist/) _, or_[\n_Twitter_](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist?lang=en?) _.

Over\n60% of companies are increasing their investment in recruitment technology,\naccording to Aptitude Research's 2019 Talent Acquisition survey. Companies are\nlooking at both traditional providers and startups to help them solve\nchallenges with attracting, recruiting, and hiring talent.\n\nNowadays, technology does more than keeping organizations compliant and\nproviding a workflow for moving candidates through the process. As a result,\nthe modern landscape is shifting from a transactional model to a more\nsophisticated suite of solutions. According to CareerXroads 2019 Tech Stack\nBenchmark study, organizations see the following impact from their talent\nacquisition tech stack: reduced time to hire (56%), reduced recruitment costs\n(35%), and improved quality of hire (30%).\n\n**Components of talent acquisition tech**\n\nAccording to the Key Trends in Talent Acquisition Technology 2019 report, the\ntalent recruitment tech stack consists of three core systems: recruitment\nmarketing/candidate relationship management, applicant tracking system (ATS),\nand onboarding. There's also an ecosystem of solutions that integrate with\nthese core systems, such as solutions for sourcing and screening candidates,\ninterviewing, analytics, assessments, employee referrals, and communication.\n\n**Recruitment marketing platform:** Often referred to as \"pre-applicant\nplatform,\" this solution manages outbound sourcing, inbound recruitment\nmarketing, and employer branding - and integrates with any ATS.\n\n**ATS:** With about 80% of companies investing in an ATS, this market is the\nmost mature in talent acquisition. A modern ATS covers the entire pre-hire\nlife cycle, including candidate acquisition, requisition management, job\npostings, search capabilities, interview management, communications, and\nreporting.\n\n**Onboarding system:** It includes forms and tasks management and\nsocialization in the company culture.\n\n**How technology helps improve talent acquisition**\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\nEmployers know that they have work to do when it comes to applying technology\nto improve talent acquisition. Among 1,000 HR decision-makers surveyed by\nAllegis Group, 97% agree that budgeting more for new talent recruitment\ntechnologies would help them achieve their business goals, and 88% anticipate\nan increase in their investment. Meanwhile, among companies that have recently\ninvested, 86% to 92% found adoption challenging.\n\nThe following are examples of notable developments in the talent recruitment\ntechnology space, according to Allegis Global Solutions:\n\n**Programmatic advertising**  \nProgrammatic advertising solutions apply software to automate the process of\nbuying job ads. They use electronic marketplaces where publishers list their\nad space and buyers bid for that space. With artificial intelligence,\nprogrammatic solutions arrive at the agreed-upon process and place ads in\noptimal locations based on user data.\n\nAppcast is an example of programmatic advertising for talent acquisition. The\ncompany's publisher solution aims to ensure that the right ad reaches the\ntargeted candidate audience to deliver an optimized, cost-effective\nadvertising strategy. Employers can expect more partnerships between\nprogrammatic advertising solutions and broader talent systems such as the\nlarger ATS and customer relationship management providers.\n\n**Social search**  \nSocial search solutions automate the time-consuming research that recruiters\nconduct to identify and engage talent based on data from various sources.\nIncorporating AI functionality, these solutions draw from social channels and\ninternal databases, lead recruiters to candidates who align with job\nopportunities and improve the accuracy of results.\n\nHiringSolved is an innovator in applying AI to the search process. The company\ncan take an inquiry from a recruiter in plain language and then search\ninternal and social channels quickly and effectively to identify potential\ntalent based on the inquiry. It ranks results according to relevance,\npinpointing the right potential candidates for a role amid the vast volume of\nsocial media data available.\n\n**Conversational AI**  \nConversational AI refers to chatbots that are present on an employer's career\npage. These assistants engage job seekers in natural questions during the\napplication process, tackle the \"black hole\" of communications by giving\ncandidates basic interactions such as status updates, and screen out\nunsuitable candidates before they invest unnecessary time and burden\nrecruiters.\n\nParadox, for example, describes itself as the maker of an \"assistive\nintelligence\" platform, with Olivia as its main product. Olivia offers\nbenefits to all aspects of the recruitment process, from sourcing and\nscreening candidates to facilitating engagement. The AI technology is made to\nwork within the talent technology ecosystem - whether integrated through an\nATS platform or an enterprise resource planning system.\n\n**Automated writing analysis and optimization**  \nWriting analysis tools are AI-driven apps that analyze text and recommend\nimprovements for job ads, emails to candidates, or other talent acquisition\ncommunications. They display results while a user is entering text into the\ntool and help recruiters refine text in real-time to remove bias, target\ntalent better, and deliver clear, compelling messages.\n\nTextio is one example of such technology. The augmented writing platform\nanalyzes new job descriptions instantly and compares it to the more than 80\nmillion descriptions it has processed. As a simple solution for recruiters,\naugmented writing checks grammar, spelling, and clarity while also using\nmachine learning to improve their understanding of messages that have been\nproven effective over time.\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily

Thu, Jan 23 20205:40 PM EST\n\n[Eric\nRosenbaum](https://www.cnbc.com/id/100846695)[@erprose](https://twitter.com/erprose)\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Aneel Bhusri, Workday co-founder and CEO, has grown the human resources company to a valuation over $40 billion.\n  * At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the billionaire said the breakthrough technologies AI and blockchain will become increasingly important on the job market.\n\nVIDEO8:2308:23\n\nWorkday CEO Aneel Bhusri in Davos on his vision for company growth and more\n\n[Squawk Box](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/)\n\n[Workday](/quotes/?symbol=WDAY) co-founder and CEO Aneel Bhusri has been a\nsuccess. He started the human resources technology company in 2005 and has\ngrown it to a stock market valuation over $40 billion. His own net worth is\nvalued by Forbes in the billions. He sees technology playing a big role in the\nsuccess of all workers in the future. In particular, machine learning and the\nblockchain.\n\n\"Blockchain is a technology looking for a problem to solve. We found one to\nsolve, which is credentials,\" Bhusri told the anchors of CNBC's \"Squawk Box\"\nfrom the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday.\n\n\"Employees can go from company to company and carry credentials with them in a\nprivate network. It can't be edited by an outside source,\" he said.\n\nThe blockchain would prevent the ability of job seekers to lie about their\nprofessional and educational histories, which has been a pervasive problem,\neven up to the level of CEOs, on platforms like LinkedIn and for background-\ncheck firms that work with hiring companies. Workday has a partnership with\nFirst Advantage for background-screening technology.\n\n\"Whatever information you want to carry ... it gives employees power over\ndata,\" Bhusri said. \"Universities can also make sure that diplomas cited by\njob seekers are real.\"\n\nThe education sector is moving in this direction. [One example is\nBlockcerts](https://www.blockcerts.org/about.html), a platform developed at\nMIT that can be used for creating, issuing, viewing and verifying blockchain-\nbased educational certificates.\n\nWhile many talk about AI, Bhusri said he prefers to talk about machine\nlearning and how its predictive power will change the job market of the\nfuture.\n\n\"AI gives people images of the Terminator, and that's not the world we live\nin. Machine learning lets you make predictions ... sifting through massive\namounts of data. ... Humans are great at making judgments.\"\n\nBhusri said the predictive power of machine learning will allow humans to then\nmake great judgments, and that process will become important to finding the\nright job fit.\n\n\"AI will predict the right next move in your career,\" Bhusri said.\n\nThe WorkDay CEO is not alone in focusing on this opportunity.

The workplace I described in my book, [_The 2020\nWorkplace: How Innovative Companies Attract, Develop, and Keep Tomorrow's\nEmployees Today_](https://www.amazon.com/2020-Workplace-Innovative-Companies-\nTomorrows/dp/0061763276 \"https://www.amazon.com/2020-Workplace-Innovative-\nCompanies-Tomorrows/dp/0061763276\"), is now distinguished by a workplace where\nthe rapid pace of change is the new constant in the world of work!\n\nAs we head into the 2020 workplace, ask yourself: how can you lead your HR\nfunction in the next decade?\n\n![Humans + Bots](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e1f37d7a854780006e8966f/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nHumans + Bots\n\nShutterstock / Panuwat Phimpha\n\nHere is my countdown of what you need to include on your HR agenda for the\n2020 workplace:\n\n### **#1)** Start With Focusing On Worker Wellbeing\n\nMany companies concerned about the future of work focus on the massive\ndisruption of jobs, automation, and workforce demographics. All of this is\nimportant but as HR leaders we need to start with making worker wellbeing a\npriority in 2020!\n\nMichael Fenlon, Chief People Officer of [PwC](https://www.pwc.com/\n\"https://www.pwc.com/\"), shares why this is growing in importance, \"As HR\nleaders worker wellbeing is impacted by several macro trends such as the\ngrowth of the digital economy and the increased need to develop resilience\nwhile we are being bombarded by constant social media notifications. We\ndecided as a firm it was time to study this and take action.\" PwC conducted a\ncomprehensive study among their global workforce with University of Southern\nCalifornia (USC) to explore this in depth.\n\nFirst, PwC defined worker wellbeing in a holistic way, including physical,\nmental, emotional, and spiritual lenses. Then PwC team set out to identify\nspecific practices that can improve wellbeing. This makes wellbeing tangible\nrather than an abstract concept. These habits are identified in the [PwC Habit\nBank](https://habitbank.pwc.com/#tab=1 \"https://habitbank.pwc.com/#tab=1\") and\nrange from reminding employees to stand up for short meetings, wind down prior\nto sleep, make time to be outside with nature, turn off smartphone\nnotifications, and decide what \"not\" to do as well as what to \"focus\" on!\n\nPwC created a technology platform that integrates all of this called [Be Well,\nWork Well](https://habitbank.pwc.com/#tab=1\n\"https://habitbank.pwc.com/#tab=1\") and it is a one-stop-shop for all things\nwellbeing.\n\nBut just providing the information on wellbeing isn't enough. According to\nFenlon, \"The real power lies in creating a wellbeing culture, making a\ncommitment to wellbeing at the individual, team, and organizational levels and\nequipping employees with technology that promotes wellbeing behaviors.\" This\nis just the advice we need as we craft our HR agenda for the 2020 workplace!\n\n### **#2) Prepare for Humans + Bots as The New Blended Workforce**\n\nWhen we think of the blended workforce we often think of full-time workers\nworking side by side with contract and gig workers. In 2020 when we refer to\nthe \"blended workforce,\" we mean humans and bots working together.\n\nResearch among 8,370 global HR leaders, hiring managers and employees\nconducted by [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html\n\"https://www.oracle.com/index.html\") and [Future\nWorkplace](https://futureworkplace.com/ \"https://futureworkplace.com/\") found\nthat half (50%) of workers already use some form of A.I. at work, up from 32%\nin 2018. As Gartner predicts, by 2021 [25% of workers will use a virtual\nemployee assistant (VEA)](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-\nreleases/2019-01-09-gartner-predicts-25-percent-of-digital-workers-will-u\n\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-01-09-gartner-\npredicts-25-percent-of-digital-workers-will-u\") daily, an increase from less\nthan 2% in 2019. This includes Amazon Alexa for Business and an array of\nconversational bots used for all types of HR processes.\n\nKnowing how to orient, develop, engage, and work side by side with a bot will\nbe the newest skill set for 2020, as human and bot teams will work together\nand, in many cases, outperform either humans or bots working on their own! How\nyou orient, develop and engage your blended workforce in 2020 will be your\ncompetitive advantage.\n\n[DBS Bank](https://www.dbs.com.sg/index/default.page\n\"https://www.dbs.com.sg/index/default.page\"), the largest bank in Southeast\nAsia was an early adopter to using a chatbot for recruiting high-volume jobs\nin the consumer bank.\n\n[DBS created a chatbot to augment talent acquisition and was able to:\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/01/08/ten-hr-trends-in-the-\nage-of-artificial-intelligence/#223334a33219\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/01/08/ten-hr-trends-in-the-\nage-of-artificial-intelligence/#223334a33219\")\n\n  1. [shorten the screening time from 32 minutes per candidate to 8 minutes per candidate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/01/08/ten-hr-trends-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/#223334a33219 \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/01/08/ten-hr-trends-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/#223334a33219\")\n  2. [improve completion rate of job application from 85% to 97% and ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/01/08/ten-hr-trends-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/#223334a33219 \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/01/08/ten-hr-trends-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/#223334a33219\")\n  3. [ respond to 96% of all candidate queries](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/01/08/ten-hr-trends-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/#223334a33219 \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/01/08/ten-hr-trends-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/#223334a33219\"). \n\nThis allowed DBS recruiters to perform higher-value work such as sourcing,\nrecruitment marketing, and engaging with candidates, and it even inspired them\nto create a new job role: Chatbot Coach training the chatbot with the latest\ninformation to answer candidates\u2019 queries.\n\n### **#3) Look for New Use Cases of AI 4 HR**\n\nArtificial intelligence is being used in talent acquisition at both\n[L\u2019Oreal](https://www.lorealparis.ca/en \"https://www.lorealparis.ca/en\") and\n[Hilton Hotels](https://www.hilton.com/en/ \"https://www.hilton.com/en/\") to\ndeliver significant results increasing speed to hire and allowing recruiters\nto assume more strategic roles. It\u2019s time in 2020 to expand AI to other HR\nprocesses. The range of new use cases includes Schneider Electric's launch of\nan AI powered internal talent mobility platform, Open Talent Market, and\nDaVita's pilot of an AI powered tool to report misconduct in the workplace.\n\nAndrew Saidy, vice president of talent digitization for [Schneider Electric\n](https://www.se.com \"https://www.se.com\")sees the [Open Talent\nMarket](https://lnkd.in/faVd9Yj \"https://lnkd.in/faVd9Yj\") as a one stop\ncareer development and mobility platform where employees can build a profile,\nsee the range of jobs that fit their desires, explore new career\npossibilities, and even connect to a mentor to prepare for a future role.\nSaidy believes that \"AI-powered career development is now the expectation of\ncandidates as they assess career growth and mobility opportunities at a\nprospective employer.\"\n\nSexual harassment exposed by the #metoo movement led to the development of\nanother new application of AI at work: an AI powered platform to report sexual\nmisconduct in the workplace. According to Jeff Rieb, Senior Director, People\nOperations & Innovation, [DaVita](https://www.davita.com/\n\"https://www.davita.com/\"), \"One of the many benefits of using an AI Bot to\nreport discriminatory behavior is while employees want to report these events,\nthey are reluctant to do so out of fear of retaliation. But reporting the\nincidence to a conversational bot results in a time stamped report of the\ninformation they can either send to their employer (anonymously) or hold on to\nfor potential reporting at another time.\"\n\nLook for more leading-edge use cases of AI for HR in 2020 to power every\naspect of the employee life cycle.\n\n### **#4) Focus On Building Ethical AI**\n\nAs we move into 2020, a key issue for companies will be to use AI in an\nethical and responsible manner and prove it. AI vendors and companies using AI\nplatforms may be [subjected to requirements\nsimilar](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/news/450421130/Data-\nskeptic-Cathy-ONeil-explains-why-we-need-to-regulate-algorithms\n\"https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/news/450421130/Data-skeptic-Cathy-\nONeil-explains-why-we-need-to-regulate-algorithms\") to safety checks now\nconducted on automobiles. Conducting AI audits and testing for unequal\noutcomes across gender, race, and age will start to be commonplace.\n\nConsider [California's Bot Transparency\nbill](https://www.financialservicesperspectives.com/2019/06/californias-bot-\ntransparency-law-goes-into-effect-on-july-1-2019/\n\"https://www.financialservicesperspectives.com/2019/06/californias-bot-\ntransparency-law-goes-into-effect-on-july-1-2019/\") which went into effect\nJuly 1, 2019 requiring firms to disclose when a bot rather than a human is\nanswering questions online. This is followed by a [new Illinois bill which\nsets new rules for using AI for video\ninterviews](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/state-\nand-local-updates/pages/illinois-ai-video-interviews.aspx\n\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/legal-and-compliance/state-and-local-\nupdates/pages/illinois-ai-video-interviews.aspx\") and goes into effect January\n1, 2020 requiring employers to tell candidates they are using AI to analyze\nvideo interviews before asking them to record and submit an interview.\n\nBeyond understanding these emerging laws, HR leaders must be prepared for\nissues related to employee data privacy. In the Oracle and Future Workplace\nresearch, AI @ Work, conducted among [8,370 global HR leaders, employees and\nmanagers 80% of employees shared their company should ask permission before\ngathering data on them using AI and 71% said they are at least sometimes\nconcerned that there will be more data security breaches as companies use AI\nin the workplace.](https://futureworkplace.com/ebooks/aiwork-from-fear-to-\nenthusiasm/ \"https://futureworkplace.com/ebooks/aiwork-from-fear-to-\nenthusiasm/\")\n\nThere is a new competency for HR: understanding how to build ethical and\nresponsible AI.\n\n### **#5) Consider Soft Skills to Be Power Skills In 2020**\n\nAs more routine tasks are taken over by AI in the workplace, as depicted in\n[McKinsey's Global Institute report, Jobs Lots and Jobs Gained, The Workforce\nin a time of\nTransition](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Future%20of%20Organizations/What%20the%20future%20of%20work%20will%20mean%20for%20jobs%20skills%20and%20wages/MGI-\nJobs-Lost-Jobs-Gained-Executive-summary-December-6-2017.ashx\n\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Future%20of%20Organizations/What%20the%20future%20of%20work%20will%20mean%20for%20jobs%20skills%20and%20wages/MGI-\nJobs-Lost-Jobs-Gained-Executive-summary-December-6-2017.ashx\") there will be\nan increased need for workers to hone their \"soft skills,\" or what I have\ncalled \"power skills\" in the chapter I wrote for the Federal Reserve\npublication, [Navigating the Future Workplace: The New Power Skills for Jobs\nof the Future.](https://www.investinwork.org/-/media/Files/volume-\none/Power%20Skills%20for%20Jobs%20of%20the%20Future.pdf?la=en\n\"https://www.investinwork.org/-/media/Files/volume-\none/Power%20Skills%20for%20Jobs%20of%20the%20Future.pdf?la=en\") These include\na combination of soft skills, thinking skills, and digital skills. Taken\ntogether, these skills are the new expectation for employability in 2020 and\nbeyond.\n\n![Power Skills: Soft Skills, Thinking Skills, and Digital\nSkills](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5e1e28efa854780006e886b2/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nPower Skills\n\nFuture Workplace\n\n  \n\nThese power skills are growing in importance and acknowledge how most jobs are\nbeing disrupted at the same time our expertise has a shorter shelf life. The\nsecret sauce to attracting and developing the next generation will be to\ndevelop these power skills. This is what Ravi Kumar, President, Infosys, is\npioneering as Infosys is recruiting for technical talent at [Rhode Island\nSchool of Design](https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/2018/design-\npartnership-RISD.html \"https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-\nreleases/2018/design-partnership-RISD.html\") and [Trinity College Liberal\nArts](https://commons.trincoll.edu/reporter/along-the-walk/trinity-infosys-\nlaunch-partnership/ \"https://commons.trincoll.edu/reporter/along-the-\nwalk/trinity-infosys-launch-partnership/\"). then training them in the hard\nskills they need to be successful in technical roles. Ravi Kumar says, \"We are\nfocusing on recruiting individuals with learnability and aptitude to operate\nat the intersection of design, technology, and industry, and not just\nrecruiting them for their current credentials.\"\n\n### **#6) Audit Your Workplace Environment for Physical, Emotional, and\nEnvironmental Attributes**\n\nWhen you think about creating a healthy workplace environment, you probably\nthink of fitness centers, standing desks, or even meditation rooms. These are\njust some of the workplace benefits that make up the $3.6 million spent on\nworkplace wellness in 2019. But is any of it paying off?\n\n[Future Workplace](https://futureworkplace.com/\n\"https://futureworkplace.com/\") and [View](https://view.com/\n\"https://view.com/\") recently [surveyed 1,601 workers across North\nAmerica](https://futureworkplace.com/future-workplace-wellness-study/\n\"https://futureworkplace.com/future-workplace-wellness-study/\") to figure out\nwhich wellness perks matter most to them and how these perks impact\nproductivity.\n\nSurprisingly, we found [employees want the basics first: better air quality,\naccess to natural light, and the ability to personalize their\nworkspace](https://hbr.org/2019/08/survey-what-employees-want-most-from-their-\nworkspaces \"https://hbr.org/2019/08/survey-what-employees-want-most-from-\ntheir-workspaces\"). Half of the employees we surveyed said poor air quality\nmakes them sleepier during the day, and more than a third reported up to an\nhour in lost productivity as a result.\n\nAfter conducting this research, we recommend heads of HR partner with Real\nEstate and Facilities leaders to take a holistic view of their workplace\nenvironment including defining workplace wellness as physical wellness,\nemotional wellness, and environmental wellness, then conduct an audit to\ndetermine how to improve all aspects of the workplace environment. You might\neven conduct this audit during the open enrollment period when employees are\nalready thinking about their health and wellbeing for the coming year!\n\n### **#7) Explore Virtual Reality for Corporate Training**\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) may not have reached its potential in the consumer market\nyet, but it is growing in corporate training. According to [ABI\nResearch](https://www.abiresearch.com/market-research/product/1027162-virtual-\nreality-in-enterprise-training/ \"https://www.abiresearch.com/market-\nresearch/product/1027162-virtual-reality-in-enterprise-training/\"): the VR\ntraining market will reach $6.3B by 2022.\n\nLeaders in this market, [Strivr](https://www.strivr.com/\n\"https://www.strivr.com/\") and [Mursion](https://www.mursion.com/\n\"https://www.mursion.com/\"), are offering VR solutions for a range of training\nas diverse as safety training, customer service training, leadership\ndevelopment, and re-inventing the employee experience. And research is showing\nthat immersive learning is able to facilitate behavior change in developing\nnew skills in the workplace.\n\nFor example, [Verizon has been using VR to train store managers and their team\non how to handle a potential store\nrobbery](https://www.strivr.com/resources/customers/verizon/\n\"https://www.strivr.com/resources/customers/verizon/\"). VR allows store\nmanagers to practice the nuances of proper response in a potential robbery.\n\nWhen the Verizon store managers were surveyed, [95% said they better\nunderstood the factors they would need to consider during an actual burglary\nattempt than when using traditional types of\ntraining.](https://fortune.com/longform/virtual-reality-struggle-hope-vr/\n\"https://fortune.com/longform/virtual-reality-struggle-hope-vr/\")\n\nDerek Belch, CEO of [Strivr](https://www.strivr.com/\n\"https://www.strivr.com/\") believes,\" the future of using VR in the workplace\nwill move beyond distinct use cases like Verizon store operations to be the\nnext generation of corporate training. VR is ideally suited for this because\nit delivers higher knowledge retention, increase engagement, and allows for\npractice before being in the situation.\"\n\nUsing VR for soft skills how [Mursion](https://www.mursion.com/\n\"https://www.mursion.com/\") is helping develop problem solving resolution\nskills among front desk employees at Best Western Hotels. To date, the\n[results have been impressive, with Best Western hotels experiencing an\naverage of 2-5% gains in post-guest satisfaction ratings and strong gains in\nproblem solving resolution training.](https://www.mursion.com/case-\nstudies/i-care-every-guest-every-time/ \"https://www.mursion.com/case-\nstudies/i-care-every-guest-every-time/\") According to Mark Atkinson, CEO of\n[Mursion](https://www.mursion.com/ \"https://www.mursion.com/\"), \"The big\nopportunity to use VR going forward is in the area of soft skills development.\nWhen we think about the skills employers need for the workforce of the future,\nit\u2019s skills like building empathy, handling conflict, and having difficult\nconversations with both co-workers and customers. VR provides workers with the\nopportunity to perform at their best in their moment of need.\"\n\n**#8) Re-Define Blended Learning To Include On Demand Coaching**\n\nMost coaching solutions are expensive, time consuming, and reserved for top\nleaders. In 2020, this seems out of sync with how we work and the changing\ndemographics of the workforce where Millennials and Gen Z now make up more\nthan 60% of global workers.\n\n[Mars, Incorporated,](https://www.mars.com/made-by-mars/petcare\n\"https://www.mars.com/made-by-mars/petcare\") the global food, petcare, and\nconfectionery company, felt that established approaches no longer met the\nneeds of their modern learners, or the increasing size, scale, and diversity\nof their company. Traditionally at Mars, leadership training was conducted in\na classroom and reached under half of first-time leaders globally. This\napproach limited accessibility and was inconsistent with Mars\u2019s egalitarian\nculture and principles.\n\nIn 2019, Summer Davies and the Mars University team reinvented the\norganizations new people leader training program by launching a fully virtual\ndevelopment program called Great Line Management Experience, or GLMe.

[According to\nGlassDoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/no-degree-required/\n\"https://www.glassdoor.com/blog/no-degree-required/\"), companies as varied as\nApple, Bank of America, Google, and Nordstrom will now consider and hire\ncandidates without a college degree as a requirement.\n\n[Research conducted by Wiley Educational Services and Future Workplace with\n600 HR Leaders found the majority of companies are open to hiring \"non-\ntraditional workers.\u201d](https://edservices.wiley.com/closing-the-skills-gap-\nreport-2019/ \"https://edservices.wiley.com/closing-the-skills-gap-\nreport-2019/\") More than half (53%) would hire someone with some college\ncoursework but no degree, or a person who had not attended college but earned\nindustry certification (52%), while only 10% said they would not hire someone\nwho didn\u2019t have a college degree.

This \"employee as customer mindset\" requires a total re-thinking of the\nmoments that matter to segments of employees \u2013 those starting their first day\non the job to those exiting the organization. Work needs to be as friction\nless, digital, and personalized as the rest of our lives.\n\nHR leaders at companies ranging from [IBM ](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/?ar=1\n\"https://www.ibm.com/us-en/?ar=1\") [Airbnb ](https://www.airbnb.com/\n\"https://www.airbnb.com/\")to [HP ](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html\n\"https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html\")are executing on this by forming cross\nfunctional teams of HR, Real Estate, and IT and developing a shared vision to\nidentify moments that matter to various segments of workers. As Diane Gherson,\nCHRO of IBM says,\u201d [Our job in HR is to create that connected, transparent,\nmobile, personalized, searchable and 24x7 universe through our workplace and\nour tools.\u201d ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2018/08/06/ibms-hr-\nchief-shares-best-advice-on-the-future-of-work/#70a36bde3dc4\n\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2018/08/06/ibms-hr-chief-shares-\nbest-advice-on-the-future-of-work/#70a36bde3dc4\") This means creating an\nemployee experience which mirrors our best customer experience!

While video resumes might not completely replace their\ntraditional written counterparts, they will likely become more important. The\nreasons are endless. Some of the main reasons that trigger employers to ask\nfor this type of resume is that it shows the creative, flexible and credible\nside of the character.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nWhile the written resume shows a lot about an applicant, it is a bit limited.\nAs we want to help recruiters and employers to utilize this newer approach, we\nalso want to explain why it is a good hiring practice. Of course, we are not\ndiscounting the written resume, but this more creative one allows employer to\nget that first impression, which in most cases turns out to be the final one.  \nRecruiters see an additional effort\n\nAccording to the survey that took more than 2,000 hiring managers into\nconsideration, 60% of them were interested in the video resume. who applies\nfor the job. This means that the managers, due to the lack of HR section,\nbelieve that a video resume is a good way of representation. Sending the\nelectronic version of a resume is just another standard process a candidate\nmust follow in order to apply for the job, but sending the video presentation\nis a whole different story. As a recruiter, you will see the additional effort\nof the candidate, and you will have a chance to get the first impression from\nthis video that might be crucial in determining the right person for the job.\n\n## **Video resume lowers the chance for faking**\n\nIt may happen that the candidate passes all the exams before getting to the\nfinal interview. The final interview actually reveals that the applicant has\nno practical knowledge in the marketing industry, rather he has some help from\nan experienced online marketing consultant during the testing process.\n\nAs a recruiter, you want to get quickly to the best-qualified candidates and\navoid fake applicants. In a video resume, you will be able to better assess\nthe technical skills of the applicant and other skills necessary for the job.\nIn a video, it is highly unlikely that the applicant will be able to pretend\nhe/she knows how to use SEMRush tool or any other tool the job might require.  \nIt presents the speaking abilities of an applicant\n\nHundred words and images may present a person in a good light, but her\nspeaking abilities will tell you more. The applicant can present himself much\nbetter when talking, and that means it can increase the chances of hiring the\nright person. Of course, this depends on a few other things, but generally,\nyou will have an easier time determining whether you are dealing with the\nright person for the job.\n\n## **Video is easier to store and organize**\n\nIf you had ever been in a recruiting role, you should know how hard it is to\norganize every single printed resume and store them appropriately. Instead of\nhandling paper, it is easier to download a video on your computer and store it\nin a folder. It does not only cut down the overall time but also saves\nphysical space.\n\n## **You can see the enthusiasm**\n\nUnlike on paper, a video resume allows you to see the applicant\u2019s enthusiasm.\nYou, as a recruiter, have the job of recognizing whether someone is a good fit\nand is showing a positive attitude towards the prospect of filling the role.\nIt is typically very difficult to hide the enthusiasm if you are excited about\nsomething, so you can see whether the applicant really wants the job and has\nthe desired qualities.\n\n## **Confirms that the candidate is comfortable with technology**\n\nSubmitting a simple Word document file or a PDF is easy, but recording and\nediting a video is a bit different. If a candidate did a good job and followed\nall given instructions, you can be almost confident he is tech-savvy.\n\nThe use of advanced technology and services is solid proof that the candidate\nis up-to-date with technology and less likely to experience technical\nchallenges. Therefore, the video resume is one of the things that represent\nthe candidate\u2019s ability to follow up on the complex procedures that involve\ntechnology use and the latest perks of it. Nowadays, it is not enough to only\nuse Google to get a job.\n\n## **Highlights the humor**\n\nWould you prefer to hire someone who is light-hearted or someone who is always\nserious? It might depend on your company culture and the open role, but you\u2019ll\nbe able to see a person\u2019s personality from their video resume. Someone with a\ngood sense of humor is more likely to be positive and always ready for\nteamwork. In most cases, the first couple of minutes of the video can show you\nwhether the person is happy or \u201cgrim\u201d.\n\n## **You can notice the confidence**\n\nPaper can show really great and remarkable skills of a candidate, but it\ncannot show the confidence. This video session is just what you want to see \u2013\nthe ability of the candidate to handle new things and the ability to emerge\ninto solving new problems. No one can hide his insecurity, so if you are\nlooking for a way to determine whether someone is confident, a video resume is\nthe best option. You will be able to recognize the level of confidence and\nunderstand whether you want to pursue the candidate or not.\n\n## **Confirms the precision and staying-on-point skills**\n\nSome people find it easier to stay focused on paper and have a really hard\ntime to organize their thoughts when speaking. Of course, this does not mean\nyou will reject the candidate who camera-shy, but you can realize whether that\nperson is good at precision and focus. Sometimes it can be harder to stay-on-\npoint on paper, which means that some candidates can explain precisely their\nachievements, goals, and strategies.\n\n**Learn More:[How Will Video Interviewing Tools Transform Recruitment in 2019\nand Beyond](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/how-will-video-interviewing-tools-transform-recruitment-\nin-2019-and-beyond/)**\n\n## **Easier communication skill assessment**\n\nIf you're looking for a candidate for a public relations position, you\u2019ll\nlikely be looking for someone with a bubbly personality and good public\nspeaking skills. Therefore, a Video will give you a better glimpse at the\nperson than their written resume. For example, in marketing companies, it is\nall about communicating with customers, and that means that communication\nskills must be impeccable. Jobrack platform requires a short video\npresentation in more than 90 percent of job ads since it is a powerful way to\ndetermine the language skills and cut down the time for interviewing. The\nofficials of this platform had announced they had had a lot more success in\nhiring the right people through the use of video resumes.  \nThe way candidates approach the job\n\nYes, you get insight into the applicants\u2019 state of mind and how they approach\nthe job. Every candidate wants to present himself in the best manner that\nwould get him the job he wants. As a recruiter, you can recognize whether a\nperson is blowzy or keeps professionalism at a high level. Instead of just\nreading the resume with a lot of achievements, you have a chance to see the\noverall performance of the candidate and how she interacts with new people,\nwith a new job, and a new place.\n\n**Learn More:[HireVue Receives FedRAMP Authorization for its Video\nInterviewing and Assessments\nPlatform](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/recruitment-onboarding/hirevue-\nreceives-fedramp-authorization-for-its-video-interviewing-and-assessments-\nplatform/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhy-should-employers-consider-video-\nresumes%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Why+Should+Employers+Consider+Video+Resumes%3F\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Why+Should+Employers+Consider+Video+Resumes%3F&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhy-should-employers-consider-video-\nresumes%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhy-should-employers-consider-video-\nresumes%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhy-should-employers-consider-video-\nresumes%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Why Should Employers Consider Video\nResumes?&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fwhy-should-employers-consider-video-\nresumes%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

Paris-\nbased HR tech startup [CleverConnect](http://www.cleverconnect.com/en/)'s goal\nis to change that, by helping everyone find the job that best suits them.\n\nFounded in 2010, the startup has completed a financing round of \u20ac5.5 million\nled by Sofiouest. Until now the company has been self-financed, generating a\nturnover of \u20ac14 million in 2018, which it expects to increase by 40% in 2019.\n\nCleverConnect already works with over 2,000 companies through all stages of\nrecruitment, including employer branding, sourcing, CV matching, and video\ninterviews through its platforms Visiotalent, Meteojob and HRmatch.\n\nWith more than 5 million registered jobseekers, Meteojob is one of France's\nmain job platforms, using AI to match candidate profiles with job offers.\n\nVisiotalent is CleverConnects' video interviewing platform, where candidates\ncan express themselves beyond their CVs and demonstrate their \"soft skills\".\n\nIn 2018, the company also launched HRmatch, a solution that allows companies\nto automatically and intelligently analyze CVs, identifying the candidates\nthat best fit the vacancies offered.\n\nCleverConnect plans to use the financing to invest in research and\ndevelopment, and market its Visiotalent and HRmatch platforms in medium and\nlarge companies, both in France and internationally. To support this growth,\nthe company plans to hire more than thirty new employees by the end of 2019.\n\n_\" Candidates look for customized and individualized selection processes that\nallow them to express their skills, and this transformation, also demanded by\ncompanies, will only be possible with the help of new technologies,\"_ said\nMarko Vujasinovic, president of CleverConnect.\n\n_\" We will intensify our hiring of personnel and our marketing investments to\nconsolidate our leadership in Spain, Italy and Benelux, and to go out to\nconquer new markets where we can easily develop our computer solutions,\"_ said\nLouis Coulon, co-founder and International Commercial Director of\nCleverConnect. _\" Our goal is to reach in 2019 the Anglo-Saxon markets (United\nKingdom and Ireland) and Germanic markets (Germany, Austria and Switzerland).\nThis strategy has allowed us to equip several international groups in all its\nsubsidiaries.\"_\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [CleverConnect](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/cleverconnect/)\n  * [HR tech](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/hr-tech/)\n  * [Paris](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/paris/)\n  * [recruitment platform](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/recruitment-platform/)\n  * [video interviews](https://www.eu-startups.com/tag/video-interviews/)\n\nSHARE\n\n[__Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-\nstartups.com%2F2019%2F06%2Fparis-based-hr-tech-company-cleverconnect-\nraises-e5-5-million-to-reduce-unemployment-in-europe%2F)\n[__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Paris-\nbased+HR+tech+company+CleverConnect+raises+%E2%82%AC5.5+million+to+reduce+unemployment+in+Europe&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-\nstartups.com%2F2019%2F06%2Fparis-based-hr-tech-company-cleverconnect-\nraises-e5-5-million-to-reduce-unemployment-in-europe%2F&via=EU_Startups)\n[](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-\nstartups.com%2F2019%2F06%2Fparis-based-hr-tech-company-cleverconnect-\nraises-e5-5-million-to-reduce-unemployment-in-europe%2F&title=Paris-\nbased+HR+tech+company+CleverConnect+raises+%E2%82%AC5.5+million+to+reduce+unemployment+in+Europe&source=EU-\nStartups) [__](whatsapp://send?text=Paris-\nbased+HR+tech+company+CleverConnect+raises+%E2%82%AC5.5+million+to+reduce+unemployment+in+Europe%20-%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-\nstartups.com%2F2019%2F06%2Fparis-based-hr-tech-company-cleverconnect-\nraises-e5-5-million-to-reduce-unemployment-in-europe%2F)\n\n  *   * [tweet](https://twitter.com/share)\n\nPrevious article[Record number of 279 deep tech scaleups applied for the 2019\nedition of the EIT Digital Challenge!](https://www.eu-\nstartups.com/2019/06/record-number-of-279-deep-tech-scaleups-applied-for-\nthe-2019-edition-of-the-eit-digital-challenge/)\n\nNext article[The rise of tech in football: Interview with WhoScored CEO and\nco-founder Cristiano Acconci](https://www.eu-startups.com/2019/06/the-rise-of-\ntech-in-football-interview-with-whoscored-ceo-and-co-founder-cristiano-\nacconci/)\n\n[![](https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-content/plugins/user-avatar/user-avatar-\npic.php?src=https://www.eu-startups.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/avatars/13995/1574356269-bpfull.jpg&w=96&id=13995&random=1574356269)](https://www.eu-\nstartups.com/author/mary-loritz/)\n\n[Mary Loritz](https://www.eu-startups.com/author/mary-loritz/)\n\nMary served as Head of Content at EU-Startups.com from November 2018 until\nNovember 2019.

The new enhancements are designed to\nincrease workforce visibility, maintain local market compliance, and provide\nan in-depth analysis of current global workforce data. Safeguard Global\nworkforce management can now provide time and attendance tracking, expense\nmanagement and enhanced visibility into payroll systems around the world.\n\nWith this system clients can rapidly and compliantly expand into any new\nmarket. Their recent acquisition of the WorkFor Group, a leading business\nsolutions provider for companies seeking to increase their European\noperations, will expand Safeguard Global HR services and solutions for all\nclients operating in international markets. The new product suite can handle\nemployee onboarding and management, as well as the complicated payroll\nrequirements of multinational companies.\n\n## **Talent Assessments Across Borders**\n\nAs enterprises look for new talent across borders, they need an efficient way\nto assess the potential of each job candidate wherever they are. Earlier this\nmonth SHL, billed as a talent innovation company, announced a new partnership\nwith IBM, aimed at providing talent assessment tests to businesses around the\nworld.\n\nSHL will now be able to provide their clients with IBM\u2019s Kenexa Assessment\narray, including three aptitude tests designed to assess any applicant\u2019s\ncognitive abilities in numerical, verbal and logical reasoning. The IBM\nassessments are in addition to SHL's existing talent assessments portfolio.\nThis announcement comes shortly after SHL's acquisition of Aspiring Minds,\nwhich strengthened their artificial intelligence capability.\n\n## **Live Candidate Video Interviews**\n\nAssessment tests can provide key data about any applicant, but there is no\nsubstitute for a face-to-face meeting. That is why SHL has added a video\ninterview capability to their platform, making it easy for recruiters to meet\nwith potential hires across the globe.\n\nLinkedIn\u2019s Talent Hub job candidate interface has also launched an integrated\nlive video interviewing tool, so LinkedIn Talent Hub users can interview\ncandidates anywhere and at any time.\n\nTalview, a startup that specializes in AI-powered recruitment, recently became\nan integration partner with LinkedIn's Applicant Tracking System and Talent\nHub, a system to source, manage and hire candidates anywhere. Talview's live\ninterviewing capabilities are now integrated into the LinkedIn Talent Hub\nexperience.\n\nTalview's Instahiring Experience platform offers several tools designed to\nreduce time-to-hire. They include anytime interviewing and assessments on a\nplatform that leverages natural language processing, machine learning and\nvideo analytics to enhance a candidate\u2019s evaluation and experience.\n\nThe platform also provides companies with insights throughout the hiring\nprocess, and the Talview Live interviews allow users to meet with candidates\nanywhere, as well as assess their coding, writing, speaking or other soft\nskills. These live interviews enable talent acquisition teams to hire the best\nglobal talent, without having them travel to a distant on-site location for an\ninterview.\n\n## **The Power of HR Analytics**\n\nA recent report on the global HR analytics market noted that it is expected to\nexhibit a 10.4 percent growth rate during the forecast period of 2019-2025.\nThe report notes that one of the major factors contributing to that growth is\nthe increasing adoption of HR analytics software around the world.\n\nOracle Human Resources Cloud is an all-in-one HR system designed to bring\npowerful analytics to managing a global workforce. Oracle boasts that their HR\nCloud will drive operational efficiencies across cultures and countries by\nconsolidating human resources management systems, and making it easier to\ndeploy complete HR capabilities for any industry in over 200 countries.\n\nOne success story of their HR Cloud was offered by Fujitsu, with some 26,000\nemployees in 37 countries. By adopting the Oracle HCM Cloud Fujitsu was able\nto complete the digital transformation of their HR model. Until the transition\nto Oracle, Fujitsu venues operated their HR systems and processes\nindependently. In today\u2019s global economy however, this siloed design was\nunsustainable.\n\nFujitsu credits Oracle\u2019s global solution for several key successes:  \n\n  * Empowered managers and employees to independently determine goal setting, recruiting, performance and talent management on a common platform.\n  * Enabled managers to manage diversely located teams by providing them with a single source of truth for all Fujitsu HR data.\n  * Improved evidence-based HR decisions thanks to more accurate data and predictive analytics across the organization.\n\nGlobal HR solutions with powerful data analytics are changing the way\nmultinational enterprises manage their human resources, making them smarter,\nmore agile and more successful.\n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [Artificial Intelligence](https://it.toolbox.com/tags/artificial-intelligence)\n\n# Some name\n\nFollow\n\nHR Sign In Page\n\n[Forgot Password?](https://www.toolbox.com/auth/forgot-password) [Don't have\nan account?

The\nreport said streaming was responsible for more than 300m tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2)\nin 2018, equivalent to [emissions from France](https://www.iea.org/data-and-\nstatistics?country=FRANCE&fuel=CO2%20emissions&indicator=Total%20CO2%20emissions).\n\nThe Shift Project\u2019s report continues to influence media coverage, including\narticles published earlier this month by the\n[Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/real-problem-\nnetflix-addiction-arbon-emissions) and [Thomson Reuters\nFoundation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-georgia-tech-climatechange-\nfeature-tr/how-cat-videos-could-cause-a-climate-change-nightmare-\nidUSKBN20C1A7).\n\nThe Shift Project\u2019s \u201c3.2kgCO2 per hour\u201d estimate is around eight times higher\nthan a [2014 peer-reviewed\nstudy](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/9/5/054007) on the\nenergy and emissions impacts of streaming video.\n\nThat 2014 study found streaming in the US in 2011 emitted 0.42kgCO2e per hour\non a lifecycle basis, including \u201cembodied\u201d emissions from manufacture and\ndisposal of infrastructure and devices. Emissions from operations \u2013 comparable\nin scope to the Shift Project analysis \u2013 accounted for only 0.36kgCO2e per\nhour.\n\nBecause the energy efficiency of data centres and [networks is improving\nrapidly](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3226029) \u2013\n[doubling every](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/moores-law-\nmight-be-slowing-down-but-not-energy-efficiency)[\n](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/moores-law-might-be-slowing-\ndown-but-not-energy-efficiency)[couple of\nyears](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/moores-law-might-be-\nslowing-down-but-not-energy-efficiency) \u2013 energy use and emissions today will\nbe even lower.\n\nLooking at electricity consumption alone, the Shift Project figures imply that\none hour of Netflix consumes 6.1 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity. This is\nenough to drive a Tesla Model S [more than\n30km](https://www.tesla.com/en_EU/support/european-union-energy-label), power\nan LED lightbulb constantly for a month, or [boil a kettle once a\nday](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261916303579) for\nnearly three months.\n\n**With users collectively watching[at\nleast](https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/netflix-cindy-holland-subscribers-\nwatch-average-two-hours-day-1203159868/)**\n\n[165m hours per day](https://www.streamingobserver.com/netflix-users-\nstream-164-million-hours-per-day/), the Shift Project figures imply that\nNetflix streaming consumes around 370 terawatt hours (TWh) per year, which\nwould be comfortably more than the annual electricity [demand of the\nUK](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-low-carbon-electricity-generation-\nstalls-in-2019).\n\nFor comparison, these figures are 800-times larger than figures reported by\nNetflix ([0.45TWh in\n2019](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_downloads/2020/02/0220_Netflix_EnvironmentalSocialGovernanceReport_FINAL.pdf))\nand nearly double the estimated electricity use by all data centres globally\n([198TWh in 2018](https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-buildings/data-centres-\nand-data-transmission-networks)). It is clear that the Shift Project figures\nare too high \u2013 but by how much?\n\n**Flawed assumptions**\n\nThe [assumptions](https://theshiftproject.org/en/article/unsustainable-use-\nonline-video/) behind the Shift Project analysis (largely based on a [2015\npaper](https://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/6/1/117)) contain a series of flaws,\nwhich, taken together, seriously exaggerate the electricity consumed by\nstreaming video.\n\nFirst, it overestimates bitrate, the amount of data transferred each second\nduring streaming, apparently assuming a figure of 24 megabits per second\n(Mbps), equivalent to 10.8 gigabytes (GB) per hour. This is six times higher\nthan the [global average bitrate for Netflix in\n2019](https://ispspeedindex.netflix.com/global/) (around 4.1 Mbps or 1.9\nGB/hr, [excluding cellular\nnetworks](https://ispspeedindex.netflix.com/about/)) and more than triple the\ntransfer rate of [high-definition](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87) (HD, 3\nGB/hr). Other typical transfer rates are 7 GB/hr for [ultra-high definition\n(UHD/4K)](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87) and 0.7 GB/hr for\n[stan](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87)[d](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87)[ard\ndefinition (SD)](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87).\n\n(In part, this difference stems from a stated assumption of 3Mbps apparently\nbeing converted in error to 3 megabytes per second, MBps, with each byte\nequivalent to eight bits.)\n\nThe chart below shows each of three ways that the Shift Project overestimated\nelectricity use for streaming video \u2013 such as the bitrate \u2013 and one area where\nit underestimated the actual figure. These other errors are described in the\ntext below the chart.\n\nSecond, I estimate that the Shift Project analysis overestimates the energy\nintensity of data centres and [content delivery networks\n(CDN)](https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/how-netflix-works-with-isps-\naround-the-globe-to-deliver-a-great-viewing-experience) that serve streaming\nvideo to consumers by 7- to 18-fold, relative to figures derived from [2019\nNetflix electricity consumption\ndata](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_downloads/2020/02/0220_Netflix_EnvironmentalSocialGovernanceReport_FINAL.pdf),\n[Cisco traffic\ndata](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-\nprovider/global-cloud-index-gci/white-paper-c11-738085.pdf) and [IEA\nanalysis](https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-buildings/data-centres-and-\ndata-transmission-networks).\n\nThird, my analysis shows the Shift Project overestimates the energy intensity\nof data transmission networks by 6- to 17-fold. This is the result of high\nenergy-use assumptions for various access modes \u2013 for example, 0.9 kWh/GB for\n\u201cmobile\u201d compared to my estimate of 0.1-0.2 kWh/GB for 4G mobile in 2019. The\nShift Project also assumes a higher share of data transfer through more\nenergy-intensive mobile networks compared to WiFi, which it puts at one-third\nof the total compared to less than 10% based on [Netflix\ndata](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/7/17094610/netflix-70-percent-tv-viewing-\nstatistics).\n\nHowever, the Shift Project underestimates the energy consumption of devices by\nsome 4- to 7-fold, because it assumes that viewing occurs only on smartphones\n(50%) and laptops (50%). [According to\nNetflix](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/7/17094610/netflix-70-percent-tv-viewing-\nstatistics), 70% of viewing occurs on TVs, which are much more energy-\nintensive than laptops (15% of viewing), tablets (10%), and smartphones (5%).\n\nTaken together, my analysis suggests that streaming a Netflix video in 2019\ntypically consumed 0.12-0.24kWh of electricity per hour, some 25- to 53-times\nless than estimated by the Shift Project, as shown in the chart, below left.\nThe results are highly sensitive to the choice of viewing device, type of\nnetwork connection and resolution, as shown in the chart, below right.\n\nFor example, a 50-inch LED television consumes much more electricity than a\nsmartphone (100 times) or laptop (5 times). Streaming through 4G mobile\nnetworks consumes about four times as much electricity than through WiFi.\n\nBecause phones are extremely energy efficient, data transmission accounts for\nnearly all the electricity consumption when streaming through 4G, especially\nat higher resolutions (Scenario D). Streaming an hour-long SD video through a\nphone on WiFi (Scenario C) uses just 0.037 kWh \u2013 170 times less than the\nestimate from the Shift Project.\n\n**Modest footprint**\n\nThe carbon footprint of streaming video depends first on the electricity\nusage, set out above, and then on the CO2 emissions associated with each unit\nof electricity generation.\n\nAs with other electricity end-uses, such as [electric\nvehicles](https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-electric-vehicles-help-to-\ntackle-climate-change), this means that the overall footprint of streaming\nvideo depends most heavily on [how the electricity is\ngenerated](https://www.electricitymap.org/).\n\nPowered by the current [global average electricity\nmix](https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-power-2019), streaming a 30-minute\nshow on Netflix would release 0.028-0.057kgCO2e (28-57 grammes, second column\nin the chart, below). This is some 27- to 57-times less than the 1.6kg figure\nfrom the Shift Project (leftmost column), which was compared with driving four\nmiles (6.4 kilometres).\n\nTo put it in context, my updated estimate for the average carbon footprint of\na half-hour Netflix show is equivalent to driving around 200 metres in a\nconventional car.\n\nBut as the chart above shows, this figure depends heavily on the generation\nmix of the country in question. In France, where [around 90% of electricity\ncomes from low-carbon sources](https://www.iea.org/data-and-\nstatistics?country=FRANCE&fuel=Electricity%20and%20heat&indicator=Electricity%20generation%20by%20source),\nthe emissions would be around 4gCO2e, equivalent to 20 metres of driving.\n\nUsing country average emission factors may still overestimate emissions,\nparticularly from data centres. Technology firms operating large data centres\nare leaders in corporate procurement of clean energy, accounting for about\n[half of renewable power purchase\nagreements](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/data-centres-and-energy-from-\nglobal-headlines-to-local-headaches) in recent years.\n\nThe electricity mix is also rapidly decarbonising in many parts of the world.\nFor instance, the emissions intensity of electricity in the UK [fell by nearly\n60% between 2008 and 2018](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/how-uk-\ntransformed-electricity-supply-decade/). Compared to [2018\nlevels](https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-power-2019), global emissions\nintensity of electricity [falls](https://www.carbonbrief.org/profound-shifts-\nunderway-in-energy-system-says-iea-world-energy-outlook) by around one-fifth\nby 2030 in the IEA [Stated Policies\nScenario](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-model/stated-policies-\nscenario) and by half in the [Sustainable Development\nScenario](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-model/sustainable-\ndevelopment-scenario).\n\n**Digital efficiency**\n\nAlthough the carbon footprint of streaming video remains relatively modest, it\nmight still seem reasonable to expect the overall impact to rise, given\nexponential increases in usage.\n\nHowever, there have already been major improvements in the efficiency of\ncomputing, described by \u201c[Koomey\u2019s Law](http://doi.org/10.1109/MAHC.2010.28)\u201d.\nThis law describes trends in the energy efficiency of computing, which has\ndoubled roughly every 1.6 years since the 1940s \u2013 and [every 2.7 years since\n2000](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/moores-law-might-be-\nslowing-down-but-not-energy-efficiency). A similar trend has been observed in\ndata transmission networks, with [energy intensity halving every two years\nsince 2000](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jiec.12630).\n\nCoupled with the short lifespans of devices and equipment, which hastens\nturnover, the efficiency of the overall stock of devices, data centres and\nnetworks is improving rapidly.\n\nFor example, increasingly efficient IT hardware (following Koomey\u2019s Law) and a\nmajor shift to \u201c[hyperscale](https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-\nbuildings/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks)\u201d data centres have\nhelped to keep electricity demand flat since 2015 (chart, below right). Data\ncentres worldwide today consume around [~1% of global electricity\nuse](https://www.iea.org/tcep/buildings/datacentres/), even while [internet\ntraffic has\ntripled](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-\nprovider/global-cloud-index-gci/white-paper-c11-738085.pdf) since 2015 and\ndata centre \u201cworkloads\u201d \u2013 a measure of service demand \u2013 have more than doubled\n(chart, below left).\n\nAs well as changes that are invisible to the consumer, there are also obvious\ntrends in the technology seen everyday. Devices are also\n[becoming](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/9/3027)\n\n[smaller](https://www.ourenergypolicy.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2014/06/electronics.pdf) and [more\nefficient](https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2015/20151210-gabriel-\nstudie-strombedarf-ikt.html), for example, in shifts from\n[CRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRT) to\n[LCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display) screens, and from\npersonal computers to tablets and smartphones.  \n\n**Rising demand**\n\nSet against all this is the fact that consumption of streaming media is\ngrowing rapidly. Netflix subscriptions [grew 20% last year to\n167m](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/netflix-q4-2019-earnings-\nresults-1203474435/), while [electricity consumption rose\n84%](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_downloads/2020/02/0220_Netflix_EnvironmentalSocialGovernanceReport_FINAL.pdf).\n\nMany [new video streaming](https://www.consumerreports.org/streaming-media-\ndevices/new-streaming-video-services-to-check-out/) and [cloud\ngaming](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2206200-cloud-gaming-may-be-\ngreat-for-gamers-but-bad-for-energy-consumption/) services have also launched\nin recent months. Particularly noteworthy is the rapid growth in video traffic\nover mobile networks, which is [growing at 55% per\nyear](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-\nprovider/visual-networking-index-vni/white-paper-c11-738429.html). Phones and\ntablets already account for [more than\n70%](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/data/global-youtube-mobile-watch-time-\nstatistics/) of the [billion hours of YouTube streamed every\nday](https://youtube.googleblog.com/2017/02/you-know-whats-cool-billion-\nhours.html).\n\nThe ease of accessing streaming media is leading to a large [rebound\neffect](https://blog.ucsusa.org/peter-oconnor/energy-efficiency-what-is-the-\nrebound-effect-946), with overall streaming video consumption rising rapidly.\nBut the [complexity of direct and indirect effects of digital\nservices](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/10/103001),\nsuch as streaming video, e-books, and online shopping, make it immensely\nchallenging to quantify the net environmental impacts, relative to alternative\nforms of consumption.\n\nMoreover, emerging digital technologies, such as [machine\nlearning](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612437/what-is-machine-learning-\nwe-drew-you-another-flowchart/),\n[blockchain](http://www.oecd.org/finance/OECD-Blockchain-Primer.pdf),\n[5G](https://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/wiki/energy-efficiency-2/), and\n[virtual reality](https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-to-virtual-\nreality/), are likely to further accelerate demand for data centre and network\nservices. Researchers have started to study the potential [energy and\nemissions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0152-7) impacts of these\ntechnologies, including [blockchain\n](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2019.05.012)and [machine\nlearning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02243.pdf).\n\nIt is becoming increasingly likely that efficiency gains of current\ntechnologies [may be\nunable](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/moores-law-might-be-\nslowing-down-but-not-energy-efficiency) to [keep\npace](https://journal.uptimeinstitute.com/is-pue-actually-going-up/) with this\ngrowing data demand. To reduce the risk of rising energy use and emissions,\ninvestments in RD&D for efficient next-generation computing and communications\ntechnologies are needed, alongside continued efforts to [decarbonise the\nelectricity supply](https://www.iea.org/reports/tracking-power-2019).\n\n**Broader context**\n\nStreaming video is a fairly low-emitting activity, especially compared to\ndriving to a cinema, for instance. As consumers, we can further reduce our\nenvironmental footprint by streaming at lower resolutions, using smaller\ndevices and screens, as well as connecting through WiFi instead of mobile\nnetworks. Replacing devices less often can also help, since production\naccounts for [more than two-\nthirds](https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/products/iphone/iPhone_11_PER_sept2019.pdf)\nof the lifecycle carbon emissions of mobile devices, and [electronic\nwaste](https://globalewaste.org/map/) is a growing problem across the world.\n\nTechnology companies can continue to play a big role in reducing the\nenvironmental impact of streaming, including through further efforts to\nincrease energy efficiency \u2013 both in the near-term [with new\ntechnologies](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/deepmind-ai-reduces-google-\ndata-centre-cooling-bill-40) and developing next-generation technologies \u2013 and\ninvesting in renewable energy to power their data centres and networks.\n\nSustainable design and coding could also help, such as [further improving\nvideo compression](https://netflixtechblog.com/the-end-of-video-\ncoding-40cf10e711a2). A[ recent\nstudy](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300627) explored the potential\nenergy and emission reductions of shifting YouTube music videos to audio only\nwhen playing in the background.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind the scale of emissions from digital\ntechnologies compared to other sectors, with digital technologies accounting\nfor [around 1.5% of global carbon\nemissions](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/9/3027/htm).\n\n[All sectors and technologies](https://www.iea.org/topics/tracking-clean-\nenergy-progress) are needed to help achieve the goals of the [Paris\nAgreement](https://www.carbonbrief.org/interactive-the-paris-agreement-on-\nclimate-change) and digital technologies are no exception. In fact, digital\ntechnologies, such as AI, [could help accelerate climate\naction](https://www.climatechange.ai/summaries). But, without sound climate\npolicies, AI could end up just helping to [make oil extraction\ncheaper](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/3/21030688/google-amazon-ai-oil-\ngas) or [extending the lifetime of coal\nplants](https://www.controleng.com/articles/prolonging-power-plant-life-\nthrough-artificial-intelligence/).\n\nWhat is indisputable is the need to keep a close eye on the explosive growth\nof Netflix and other digital technologies and services to ensure society is\nreceiving maximum benefits, while minimising the negative consequences \u2013\nincluding on electricity use and carbon emissions.\n\nInstead of relying on misleading media coverage, this will require rigorous\nanalysis, corporate leadership, sound policy and informed citizens.\n\n**Methodology and

Contributions from\nexisting investors include AXA Venture Partners, Sierra Ventures, Omidyar\nTechnology Ventures, Sigma Prime Ventures and Karlani Capital. To support the\nglobal demand for AI-driven talent experiences, Phenom People will use the\ninvestments for continued company growth and scale.  \n\nHeadquartered in Philadelphia with offices in Canada, India, Israel, U.K. and\nNetherlands, Phenom People has grown to 500 employees with over 300 customers\nacross all industries and ranks 120 on the Deloitte Technology Fast 500.\n\n\u201cGlobal organizations are shifting their spend from legacy singular HR tools\nto data-driven, intelligent talent experience platforms,\u201d said Mahe Bayireddi,\nCEO and co-founder at Phenom People. \u201cCHROs can make an investment in a modern\napproach\u2014connecting every interaction across the talent lifecycle for\ncandidates, recruiters, employees and management.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhenom People\u2019s talent experience technology is unrivaled in today\u2019s\nmarketplace,\u201d said Sumir Chadha, founder and managing director at WestBridge\nCapital. \u201cTheir solution is transforming and progressing HR in ways that point\nsolutions and acquired technologies do not. This matches the market direction\ntowards experience management for talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re prioritizing strategic investments that align with market trends,\u201d said\nAbhishek Sud, managing director at AB-GSC. \u201cExperience management is the next\nera for global companies investing in talent\u2014Phenom People is pioneering the\nstandards and technology. They have an impressive portfolio of large global\nbrands and a history of commitment to their customers\u2019 success.\u201d\n\nHuman Resources is a marketplace worth over $400 billion, with $32 billion\nspent on technology solutions. With over 45 million people changing jobs per\nyear in the U.S. alone, the elaborate process of job searching, sourcing,\ninterviewing and onboarding is time-consuming and costly. Employers require\ndata and automation to personalize and optimize the journey for every talent\nexperience. Yet teams continue to make the mistake of investing in a series of\nsingular tools, widening the disconnect between people, processes and systems.\n\nThe Phenom Talent Experience Management platform\u2014a single platform that\neliminates the need for multiple HR tools\u2014connects the four key stakeholder\nexperiences in the talent lifecycle and reduces time-to-hire and cost-per-\nhire, while improving talent quality and productivity:\n\n  * **Candidate Experience:** Talent leaders make the candidate journey meaningful and personalized with the integration of their career site, chatbot, CMS and university recruiting app. Instant delivery of job recommendations converts more qualified applicants and allows recruiters to spend more time with top talent.\n  *  **Recruiter Experience:** Recruiters identify top talent faster with AI-powered fit and engagement scoring in their CRM. Email and SMS campaigns further engage passive candidates and build quality pipelines.\n  *  **Employee Experience:** Talent management empowers employees to identify new career paths, learning opportunities, and skill gaps with personalized job openings and internal mobility. Automating the referral process allows them to tap into their professional networks and help fill roles faster.\n  *  **Management Experience:** Leadership and hiring managers identify gaps in the hiring process and optimize strategies by evaluating talent analytics, reporting and forecasting. These analyses also allow talent leaders to develop succession plans that prepare the organization for future growth.\n\nPhenom People hosts the world\u2019s largest talent experience conference,\n_[IAMPHENOM](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=L2ShTdojgBi-\nWBkcN58Sew33kqjV5Leig6ftsVcqCT0i8MFpC7lHNgSSJP7q9QXQvVzkq-\nbJ_NtKKNE8HN2IVmpKYzOOw1FoS0x6DycClJLRI-\ntT_eTngCB9sgkzz68cdOwqi-30jvUSYXMRvtJ2G-Dy-\nOg_S8LQ2rl19Lbh67WzIwks21oF0XDfA4ByZ2h-1K2NaOEbc6EncNxyNz2i-fNNy-\nSEIBzkhl1mhXs3riGoVB8YBdQAv01nE4YJw1H6Q_W1TRR1gLcP-UYW-\nBD1pQrOtG5SoE5UHy1fnpXS-\nzcZk0tyEagPH8x9ianKo3-QEJpo3_S8yKFYbYADo2kpZ5CXaTnIHZp7vmWcUe99Tjw=\n\"IAMPHENOM\")_ , for CHROs, talent leaders and HR practitioners.

This lays out the question, why it hasn't\npicked up in Singapore, where only a fraction of companies have even piloted\nthe method?\n\nI've heard many stories from companies in Singapore, having tried video\ninterviewing in their recruitment. In this context, I mean one-way video\ninterview, or pre-recorded interview, is where employer types in or records a\nset of questions (typically 3 to 5), and sends out the invitations to a pool\nof candidates who look promising based on CV.\n\nI've benchmarked a couple of established video interview vendors to regional\nones, and the reason is simple; they just haven't been able to deliver a\nsuperior overall experience to recruiters. Video interviewing is there to make\ntheir work easier and more efficient. Traditional recruitment is just too\ntime-consuming.\n\n![](/sites/default/files/misc/rikuinfog.png)\n\nThe breakdown below lists the major success factors why video interviews have\nbeen well received and adopted in the Nordics. Well-known organisations such\nas Uber, Netflix, ABB, Finnair, KONE, Jysk, KPMG, Manpower (the list goes on)\nwill only consider incorporating a new technology if each and every one of the\naspects below are well in place.\n\n**1\\. Robust technology, intuitive UX, and domain knowledge**  \nIn Scandinavia, video interviewing is the norm. Incumbent players understand\nhow the industry works, otherwise there's no way one can build a platform that\ndoesn't break and is loved by the users. Singapore is a tech hub currently in\na nascent stage of these offerings, so there is plenty of room to grow.\n\n**2\\. It 's all about video**  \nIn our opinion, it's just dumb to create a video platform, where there's no\noption to ask questions on video. There are many reasons why to use video\nquestions rather than just dull text questions; human touch, dialogue,\nemployer brand, candidate experience, setting the example just to name a few.\nBesides this, like Scandinanvian, Singapore has phenomenal internet speeds -\nit is a shame not to take advantage of the infrastructure to boost recruitment\nefforts.\n\n**3\\. Customer, customer, customer**  \nThere's no better roadmap than talking with your customers, learn from them\nand make their pain go away. Give users best practices training, not just\nproduct tours. The recruiters are not stupid, they can read what the button\nsays and know what should happen when they press it.\n\nUnderstanding the candidates, knowing their pain points and removing all\nobstacles from the way. If candidates first need to download an app to their\nmobile device, and having to sign in before even starting the interview is a\nhuge drop out point. Another critical factor is not to put too much pressure\non the candidates, one can destroy the candidate experience and dispel them by\nsetting too strict preparation times with no option to re-record their\nanswers.\n\nScandinavian countries are frequently on the list of the world's best places\nwith customer service. In this aspect, Singapore has plenty of catching up to\ndo.\n\nFinally, there is a need to educate the market. We painfully know that large\nmasses in most regions around the globe do not have a clue about pre-recorded\nvideo interviews. This is where vendors need to step up and educate the\nmarket. Providing professional, easily digestible content designed for each\nphase of the customer journey helps to bring the method closer to fresh\naudiences. Video interviewing started becoming mainstream in Scandinavia\naround 5 years ago, so in due time, it can also be popular in Singapore.\n\n**_The views expressed in this column are the author 's own and do not\nnecessarily reflect this publication's view, and this article is not edited by\nSingapore Business Review.

Often trained on data collected about previous or similar applicants,\nthese tools can cut down on the effort recruiters need to expend in order to\nmake a hire. Last year, 67 percent of hiring managers and recruiters\n[surveyed](https://news.linkedin.com/2018/1/global-recruiting-trends-2018) by\nLinkedIn said AI was saving them time.\n\nBut critics argue that such systems can introduce bias, lack accountability\nand transparency, and aren\u2019t guaranteed to be accurate. Take, for instance,\nthe Utah-based company HireVue, which sells a [job interview video\nplatform](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/22/ai-hiring-face-\nscanning-algorithm-increasingly-decides-whether-you-deserve-job/) that can use\nartificial intelligence to assess candidates and, it claims, predict their\nlikelihood to succeed in a position. The company says it uses on-staff\npsychologists to help develop customized assessment algorithms that reflect\nthe ideal traits for a particular role a client (usually a company) hopes to\nhire for, like a sales representative or computer engineer.\n\n![Facial recognition boxes and dots cover the photo of a blond\nman.](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/Zl3Ub85q8R-6eyM1kw8Fdh4oSXE=/0x0:5000x3334/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:5000x3334\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19484592/GettyImages_1189384731.jpg) Output\nof an Artificial Intelligence system from Google Vision, performing facial\nrecognition on a photograph of a man in San Ramon, California on November 22,\n2019. Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images\n\nThat algorithm is then used to analyze how individual candidates answer\npreselected questions in a recorded video interview, grading their verbal\nresponses and, in some cases, facial movements. HireVue claims the tool \u2014\nwhich is used by about 100 clients, including\n[Hilton](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/464889/Hilton%20Aug%202017/2017_12_SuccessStory_Hilton_CustomerMarketing3.pdf?__hstc=&__hssc=&hsCtaTracking=b76cefe9-cece-4631-bef5-53084aa900e5%7Ca26c5bca-5fbe-46e3-b0e4-c1f79894f72c)\nand [Unilever](https://www.hirevue.com/customers/global-talent-acquisition-\nunilever-case-study) \u2014 is more predictive of job performance than human\ninterviewers conducting the same structured interviews.\n\nBut last month, lawyers at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a\nprivacy rights nonprofit, filed a\n[complaint](https://epic.org/privacy/ftc/hirevue/EPIC_FTC_HireVue_Complaint.pdf)\nwith the Federal Trade Commission, pushing the agency to investigate the\ncompany for potential bias, inaccuracy, and lack of transparency. It also\naccused HireVue of engaging in \u201cdeceptive trade practices\u201d because the company\nclaims it doesn\u2019t use facial recognition. (EPIC argues HireVue\u2019s facial\nanalysis qualifies as facial recognition.)\n\nThe lawsuit follows the introduction of the [Algorithmic Accountability\nAct](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Algorithmic%20Accountability%20Act%20of%202019%20Bill%20Text.pdf)\nin Congress earlier this year, which would grant the FTC authority to create\nregulations to check so-called \u201cautomated decision systems\u201d for bias.\nMeanwhile, the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (EEOC) \u2014 the federal\nagency that deals with employment discrimination \u2014 is reportedly now\ninvestigating at least two discrimination cases involving job decision\nalgorithms, according to [Bloomberg Law](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-\nlabor-report/punching-in-workplace-bias-police-look-at-hiring-algorithms).\n\n### AI can pop up throughout the recruitment and hiring process\n\nRecruiters can make use of artificial intelligence throughout the hiring\nprocess, from advertising and attracting potential applicants to predicting\ncandidates\u2019 job performance. \u201cJust like with the rest of the world\u2019s digital\nadvertisement, AI is helping target who sees what job descriptions [and] who\nsees what job marketing,\u201d explains Aaron Rieke, a managing director at\n[Upturn](https://www.upturn.org/reports/2018/hiring-algorithms/), a DC-based\nnonprofit digital technology research group.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just a few outlier companies, like HireVue, that use predictive\nAI. Vox\u2019s own HR staff use\n[LinkedIn](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/04/ai-behind-linkedin-\nrecruiter-search-and-recommendation-systems) Recruiter, a popular tool that\nuses artificial intelligence to rank candidates. **** Similarly, the jobs\nplatform ZipRecruiter uses AI to match candidates with nearby jobs that are\npotentially good fits, based on the traits the applicants have shared with the\nplatform \u2014 like their listed skills, experience, and location \u2014 and previous\ninteractions between similar candidates and prospective employers. For\ninstance, because I applied for a few San Francisco-based tutoring gigs on\nZipRecruiter last year, I\u2019ve continued to receive emails from the platform\nadvertising similar jobs in the area.\n\n### Join the Open Sourced Reporting Network\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WtR44_5nNvKREIyWx-\nsozMpsfEE=/0x0:1800x1013/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:1800x1013\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19444607/call_out_post_art_1.jpg) Christina\nAnimashaun/Vox\n\nOpen Sourced is Recode by Vox\u2019s year-long reporting project to demystify the\nworld of data, personal privacy, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. And\nwe need your help. [Fill out this form to contribute to our\nreporting](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/9/20970994/open-sourced-\nreporting-network).\n\nOverall, the company says its AI has trained on more than 1.5 billion\nemployer-candidate interactions.\n\nPlatforms like Arya \u2014 which says it\u2019s been used by Home Depot and Dyson \u2014 go\neven further, using machine learning to find candidates based on data that\nmight be available on a company\u2019s internal database, public job boards, social\nplatforms like Facebook and LinkedIn, and other profiles available on the open\nweb, like those on professional membership sites.\n\nArya claims it\u2019s even able to predict whether an employee is likely to leave\ntheir old job and take a new one, based on the data it collects about a\ncandidate, such as their promotions, movement between previous roles and\nindustries, and the predicted fit of a new position, as well as data about the\nrole and industry more broadly.\n\nAnother use of AI is to screen through application materials, like r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and\nassessments, in order to recommend which candidates recruiters should contact\nfirst. Somen Mondal, the CEO and co-founder of one such screening and matching\nservice, Ideal, says these systems do more than automatically search r\u00e9sum\u00e9s\nfor relevant keywords.\n\nFor instance, Ideal can learn to understand and compare experiences across\ncandidates\u2019 r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and then rank the applicants by how closely they match an\nopening. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a recruiter Googling a company [listed on an\napplication] and learning about it,\u201d explains Mondal, who says his platform is\nused to screen 5 million candidates a month.\n\nBut AI doesn\u2019t just operate behind the scenes. If you\u2019ve ever applied for a\njob and then been engaged by a text conversation, there\u2019s a chance you\u2019re\ntalking to a recruitment bot **.** Chatbots that use natural-language\nunderstanding created by [companies like Mya](https://www.mya.com/) can help\nautomate the process of reaching out to previous applicants about a new\nopening at a company, or finding out whether an applicant meets a position\u2019s\nbasic requirements \u2014 like availability \u2014 thus eliminating the need for human\nphone-screening interviews. Mya, for instance, can reach out over text and\nemail, as well as through messaging applications like Facebook and WhatsApp.\n\nAnother burgeoning use of artificial intelligence in job selection is talent\nand personality assessments. One company championing this application is\nPymetrics, which sells neuroscience computer games for candidates to play (one\nsuch game involves [hitting the\nspacebar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzSlmZZQZgQ) whenever a red circle,\nbut not a green circle, flashes on the screen).\n\nThese games are meant to predict candidates\u2019 \u201ccognitive and personality\ntraits.\u201d Pymetrics says on its website that the system studies \u201cmillions of\ndata points\u201d collected from the games to match applicants to jobs judged to be\na good fit, based on Pymetrics\u2019 predictive algorithms.\n\n### Proponents say AI systems are faster and can consider information human\nrecruiters can\u2019t calculate quickly\n\nThese tools help HR departments move more quickly through large pools of\napplicants and ultimately make it cheaper to hire. Proponents say they can be\nmore fair and more thorough than overworked human recruiters skimming through\nhundreds of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and cover letters. ****\n\n\u201cCompanies just can\u2019t get through the applications. And if they do, they\u2019re\nspending \u2014 on average \u2014 three seconds,\u201d Mondal says. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole problem\nwith efficiency.\u201d He argues that using an AI system can ensure that every\nr\u00e9sum\u00e9, at the very least, is screened. After all, one job posting might\nattract thousands of applications, with a huge share from people who are\ncompletely unqualified for a role.\n\nSuch tools can automatically recognize traits in the application materials\nfrom previous successful hires and look for signs of that trait among\nmaterials submitted by new applicants. Mondal says systems like Ideal can\nconsider between 16 and 25 factors (or elements) in each application, pointing\nout that, unlike humans, it can calculate something like commute distance in\n\u201cmilliseconds.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can start to fine-tune the system with not just the people you\u2019ve brought\nin to interview, or not just the people that you\u2019ve hired, but who ended up\ndoing well in the position. So it\u2019s a complete loop,\u201d Mondal explains. \u201cAs a\nhuman, it\u2019s very difficult to look at all that data across the lifecycle of an\napplicant. And [with AI] this is being done in seconds.\u201d\n\nThese systems typically operate on a scale greater than a human recruiter. For\ninstance, HireVue claims the artificial intelligence used in its video\nplatform evaluates \u201c[tens of thousands of\nfactors](https://www.hirevue.com/blog/hirevue-assessments-and-preventing-\nalgorithmic-bias).\u201d Even if companies are using the same AI-based hiring tool,\nthey\u2019re likely using a system that\u2019s optimized to their own hiring\npreferences. Plus, an algorithm is likely changing if it\u2019s continuously being\ntrained on new data.\n\nAnother service, Humantic, claims it can get a sense of candidates\u2019 psychology\nbased on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, LinkedIn profiles, and other text-based data an\napplicant might volunteer to submit, by mining through and studying their use\nof language (the product is inspired by the field of psycholinguistics). The\nidea is to eliminate the need for additional personality assessments. \u201cWe try\nto recycle the information that\u2019s already there,\u201d explains Amarpreet Kalkat,\nthe company\u2019s co-founder. He says the service is used by more than 100\ncompanies.\n\nProponents of these recruiting tools also claim that artificial intelligence\ncan be used to avoid human biases, like an unconscious preference for\ngraduates of a particular university, or a bias against women or a racial\nminority. (But AI often amplifies bias; more on that later.) They argue that\nAI can help strip out \u2014 or abstract \u2014 information related to a candidate\u2019s\nidentity, like their name, age, gender, or school, and more fairly consider\napplicants.\n\nThe idea that AI might clamp down on \u2014 or at least do better than \u2014 biased\nhumans inspired California lawmakers earlier this year to introduce [a\nbill](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200ACR125)\nurging fellow policymakers to explore the use of new technology, including\n\u201cartificial intelligence and algorithm-based technologies,\u201d to \u201creduce bias\nand discrimination in hiring.\u201d\n\n### AI tools reflect who builds and trains them\n\nThese AI systems are only as good as the data they\u2019re trained on and the\nhumans that build them. If a r\u00e9sum\u00e9-screening machine learning tool is trained\non historical data, such as r\u00e9sum\u00e9s collected from a company\u2019s previously\nhired candidates, the system will inherit both the conscious and unconscious\npreferences of the hiring managers who made those selections. That approach\ncould help find stellar, highly qualified candidates. But Rieke warns that\nmethod can also pick up \u201csilly patterns that are nonetheless real and\nprominent in a data set.\u201d\n\nOne such r\u00e9sum\u00e9-screening tool identified being named Jared and having played\nlacrosse in high school as the best predictors of job performance, as Quartz\n[reported](https://qz.com/1427621/companies-are-on-the-hook-if-their-hiring-\nalgorithms-are-biased/).\n\nIf you\u2019re a former high school lacrosse player named Jared, that particular\ntool might not sound so bad. But systems [can also learn to be racist, sexist,\nageist, and biased](https://www.vox.com/science-and-\nhealth/2017/4/17/15322378/how-artificial-intelligence-learns-how-to-be-racist)\nin other nefarious ways. For instance,\n[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-\ninsight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-\nwomen-idUSKCN1MK08G) reported last year that Amazon had created a recruitment\nalgorithm that unintentionally **** tended to favor male applicants over\nfemale applicants for certain positions. The system was trained on a decade of\nr\u00e9sum\u00e9s submitted to the company, which Reuters reported were mostly from men.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/YFh37C_1TS7YTgDzG184lKJjr_g=/0x0:3600x2400/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:3600x2400\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19484600/GettyImages_664440974.jpg) A\nvisitor at Intel\u2019s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Day walks past a signboard in\nBangalore, India on April 4, 2017. Manjunath Kiran/AFP via Getty Images\n\n(An Amazon spokesperson told Recode that the system was never used and was\nabandoned for several reasons, including because the algorithms were primitive\nand that the models randomly returned unqualified candidates.)\n\nMondal says there is no way to use these systems without regular, extensive\nauditing. That\u2019s because, even if you explicitly instruct a machine learning\ntool not to discriminate against women, it might inadvertently learn to\ndiscriminate against other proxies associated with being female, like having\ngraduated from a women\u2019s college.\n\n\u201cYou have to have a way to make sure that you aren\u2019t picking people who are\ngrouped in a specific way and that you\u2019re only hiring those types of people,\u201d\nhe says. Ensuring that these systems are not introducing unjust bias means\nfrequently checking that new hires don\u2019t disproportionately represent one\ndemographic group.\n\nBut there\u2019s skepticism that efforts to \u201cde-bias\u201d algorithms and AI are a\ncomplete solution. And Upturn\u2019s report on [equity and hiring\nalgorithms](https://www.upturn.org/reports/2018/hiring-algorithms/) notes that\n\u201c[de-biasing] best practices have yet to crystallize [and] [m]any techniques\nmaintain a narrow focus on individual protected characteristics like gender or\nrace, and rarely address intersectional concerns, where multiple protected\ntraits produce compounding disparate effects.\u201d\n\nAnd if a job is advertised on an online platform like Facebook, it\u2019s possible\nyou won\u2019t even see a posting because of biases produced by _that_ platform\u2019s\nalgorithms. There\u2019s also concern that systems like HireVue\u2019s could inherently\nbe built to[ discriminate against people with certain\ndisabilities](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2019/10/31/for-some-\nemployment-algorithms-disability-discrimination-by-default/).\n\nCritics are also skeptical of whether these tools do what they say, especially\nwhen they make broad claims about a candidates\u2019 \u201cpredicted\u201d psychology,\nemotion, and suitability for a position. Adina Sterling, an organizational\nbehavior professor at Stanford, also notes that, if not designed carefully, an\nalgorithm could drive its preferences toward a single type of candidate. Such\na system might miss a more unconventional applicant who could nevertheless\nexcel, like an actor applying for a job in sales.\n\n\u201cAlgorithms are good for economies of scale. They\u2019re not good for nuance,\u201d she\nexplains, adding that she doesn\u2019t believe companies are being vigilant enough\nwhen studying the recruitment AI tools they use and checking what these\nsystems actually optimize for.\n\n### Who regulates these tools?\n\nEmployment lawyer Mark Girouard says AI and algorithmic selection systems fall\nunder [the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection\nProcedures](https://nilanjohnson.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Girouard.pdf),\nguidance established in 1978 by federal agencies that guide companies\u2019\nselection standards and employment assessments.\n\nMany of these AI tools [say](https://qz.com/work/1742847/pymetrics-ceo-frida-\npolli-on-the-ai-solution-to-hiring-bias/)\n[they](https://www.hirevue.com/blog/what-is-adverse-impact-and-why-measuring-\nit-matters) follow the four-fifths rule, a statistical \u201crule of thumb\u201d\nbenchmark established under those employee selection guidelines. The rule is\nused to compare the selection rate of applicant demographic groups and\ninvestigate whether selection criteria might have had an adverse impact on a\nprotected minority group.\n\nBut experts have [noted](https://qz.com/work/1742847/pymetrics-ceo-frida-\npolli-on-the-ai-solution-to-hiring-bias/) that the rule is just one test, and\nRieke emphasizes that passing the test doesn\u2019t imply these AI tools do what\nthey claim. A system that picked candidates randomly could pass the test, he\nsays. Girouard explains that as long as a tool does not have a disparate\nimpact on race or gender, there\u2019s no law on the federal level that requires\n**** that such AI tools work as intended.\n\nIn its case against HireVue, EPIC argues that the company has failed to meet\nestablished AI transparency guidelines, including artificial intelligence\nprinciples outlined by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment that have been [endorsed by the U.S and 41 other\ncountries](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/blog/2019/us-joins-oecd-adopting-global-\nai-principles). HireVue told Recode that it follows the standards set by the\nUniform Guidelines, as well as guidelines set by other professional\norganizations. The company also says its systems are trained on a diverse data\nset and that its tools have helped its clients increase the diversity of their\nstaff.\n\nAt the state level, Illinois has made some initial headway in promoting the\ntransparent use of these tools. In January, its [Artificial Intelligence Video\nInterview\nAct](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=101-0260)\nwill take effect, which requires that employers using artificial intelligence-\nbased video analysis technology notify, explain, and get the consent of\napplicants.\n\nStill, Rieke says few companies release the methodologies used in their bias\naudits in \u201cmeaningful detail.\u201d He\u2019s not aware of any company that has released\nthe results of an audit conducted by a third party.\n\nMeanwhile, senators have\n[pushed](https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fembeds%2F388920670%2Fcontent%23from_embed&referrer=vox.com&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2Frecode%2F2019%2F12%2F12%2F20993665%2Fartificial-\nintelligence-ai-job-screen) the EEOC to investigate whether biased facial\nanalysis algorithms could violate anti-discrimination laws, and experts have\npreviously [warned](https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/10-13-16.cfm)\nthe agency about the risk of algorithmic bias. But the EEOC has yet to release\nany specific guidance regarding algorithmic decision-making or artificial\nintelligence-based tools and did not respond to Recode\u2019s request for comment.\n\nRieke did highlight one potential upside for applicants. Should lawmakers one\nday force companies to release the results of their AI hiring selection\nsystems, job candidates could gain new insight into how to improve their\napplications. But as to whether AI will ever make the final call, Sterling\nsays that\u2019s a long way\u2019s off.\n\n\u201cHiring is an extremely social process,\u201d she explains. \u201cCompanies don\u2019t want\nto relinquish it to tech.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n[_Open Sourced_](http://www.vox.com/open-sourced) _is made possible by Omidyar\nNetwork.

The\nglobal labour crunch is one that seems to affect every industry; and according\nto a 2018 study by Korn Ferry, 20 major economies will feel its effect in the\nnext decade or so. A worldwide talent deficit of 85.2 million workers \u2013 larger\nthan Germany\u2019s current population \u2013 will hit these economies by 2030; and the\nglobal skills shortage could translate to US$8.45 trillion in unrealised\nannual revenue \u2013 equivalent to the combined gross domestic product of Germany\nand Japan.\n\nWith our country\u2019s birth rate slipping over the past decades, Singapore will\nnot be spared as the number of adults entering the workforce declines.\n\nKorn Ferry\u2019s study estimates that by 2030, we will be short of more than one\nmillion skilled workers \u2013 and that figure will translate into revenue losses\nof US$106.8 billion annually. Businesses might be forced to put growth plans\non hold with such a grim outlook as the talent gap widens.\n\nThe roles in human resources (HR) departments will also become increasingly\ndemanding as it has to do more than just manage staff records, payroll and\nleave; and the main challenges include attracting potential talent, as well as\nretaining new and old employees.\n\nNot only that, millennials are starting to climb the managerial ladder, while\nthe first batch of Generation Z begin entering the job market. Hence, a change\nin work culture and office dynamics are inevitable; and to say that HR has its\nwork cut out would be an understatement.\n\nThis is especially since the 2018 Millennial Survey by Deloitte found that 43\nper cent of millennials plan to quit their current job within two years and\nonly 28 per cent could see themselves staying in their current role for more\nthan five years. The survey was conducted in 36 countries, with 10,455\nmillennials and 1,844 Gen Z-ers taking part in it.\n\nTraditional HR methods such as using yearly appraisals to evaluate employees\nare fast becoming outdated as the need to keep a pulse of the workplace\nbecomes more urgent than ever. Hence, it is not uncommon to find companies\nturning to technology to cope with this sea change.\n\n**DATA-DRIVEN SOLUTION**\n\nUsing people analytics to know what employees want and to reduce turnover\nrates is becoming more widespread. During the HR Festival Asia conference in\nMay, Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad noted that HR technology is\nbecoming more accessible and affordable. He added that the field has grown to\nbecome a US$400 billion industry worldwide, and about 200 HR tech firms in\nSingapore have received about US$1.4 billion of funding from private\ninvestors.\n\nEngageRocket is one such fast-growing homegrown people analytics solution\nprovider that helps companies make better people decisions by using real-time\ndata. Founded in 2016 by Dorothy Yiu and Leong Chee Tung, who were formerly\nregional heads at American research and consulting company Gallup, it now\nserves more than 30,000 users in\n\n13 Asia-Pacific markets, across 20 industries which includes companies such as\nSephora, Thales, Novartis and Tokopedia.\n\n\u201cEngageRocket is simple to use, provides real-time actionable insights backed\nby research and can be deployed and scaled quickly within an organisation,\u201d\nsays Mr Leong. SMEs, especially, stand to benefit because EngageRocket\u2019s\nsolutions come \u201cat a fraction of the cost of hiring traditional consultants\u201d.\nIt generates revenue via a time-based subscription model, and the cost\nstructure depends on the size of the company or the team that is using\nEngageRocket\u2019s solutions.\n\nThe endgame is to level up HR capabilities and create better employee\nexperiences using real-time people analytics. \u201c(Previously) we found it was\nchallenging for HR to collect accurate employee engagement data and identify\nactionable insights in a timely and effective manner \u2013 there wasn\u2019t a good way\nfor leaders to get reliable data on each stage of the employee experience in a\nsingle place,\u201d explains Mr Leong.\n\nEngageRocket collects information through automated engagement surveys, 360\nreviews and demographic analytics from on-boarding to separation; and its\nplatform will instantly analyse and translate feedback into actionable\ninsights. This in turn will empower HR managers to make data-driven decisions,\nrectify HR programmes that are not working and find out if an individual\nmanager\u2019s leadership style is generating the desired effect on his or her\nteam.\n\n**THE CASE FOR GOING DIGITAL**\n\nThe need for continuous listening is essential. Online retailer Amazon\u2019s\nConnections programme, for instance, sends daily surveys with different\nquestions to different segments of its 566,000 employee base globally.\n\nIt might be a little extreme but Mr Leong points out that studies have shown\nthat the return on investment on people analytics can be as high as US$13 for\nevery US$1 spent: \u201cPutting data from across the employee lifecycle through\ncontinuous listening channels can clearly yield powerful talent insight.\nWhether this is a simple matter of slapping together the relevant charts on a\nsingle dashboard or having a more scientifically robust way of normalising the\ndata across stages, establishing a single source of truth for employee\nexperience data is the first step towards strategically managing the employee\nlife cycle.\u201d\n\nBecause the process is automated, businesses do not have to commit a large HR\nunit or hire an analytics team to administer and collate data and insights, he\nadds. \u201cOur solution gives leaders the ability and time to focus on areas of\nimprovement and to personalise their management style in the best way to\nimprove employee motivation \u2013 we allow HR and leaders to build better\nworkplaces by removing unnecessary complexity while preserving employees\u2019\nconfidentiality.\u201d\n\nHe adds that unhappy or \u201cdisengaged employees\u201d are red flagged by their lack\nof response to survey questions, as well as their behaviour interacting with\nEngageRocket\u2019s platform. \u201cFor example, by analysing our customers\u2019 results, we\nfound that a low survey participation rate indicates a warning signal for\nupcoming talent attrition \u2013 non-respondents in that study had a 2.7x higher\nlikelihood of leaving the company within six months,\u201d Mr Leong explains.\n\n**COMBINING DATA SCIENCE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**\n\nPulsifi is another homegrown Big Data HR startup that seeks to discover and\nrealise the potential of job candidates and employees in the workplace by\nusing artificial intelligence (AI). The company, founded by Peter Yoong and\nJay Huang in 2016, secured US$1.1 million in funding from three angel\ninvestors last August to enhance its people analytics platform.\n\nThe two have over four decades of working experience between them, and know\nfirst-hand that the single biggest challenge that any company faces lies in\nfinding and developing great people. \u201cGreat people are the key to bringing any\norganisation to greater success,\u201d says Mr Huang, who is also Pulsifi\u2019s CEO.\n\u201cOn the other hand, we saw that so few of the people around us actually looked\nforward to starting the work week on Mondays \u2013 and so much of their lifetime\nis spent at work! \u2013 (so) if their people are not motivated, organisations will\nnot achieve their success.\u201d\n\nAs the founders themselves used to work in digital marketing \u2013 an industry\nthat already heavily uses data points to map out consumer preferences \u2013\nPulsifi decided to apply a similar approach to HR. The company\u2019s solution is a\ncloud-based people analytics software platform that combines organisational\npsychology and data science into AI that predicts the suitability of people to\na role, team and organisation. \u201cPulsifi is unique in two aspects \u2013 firstly, we\nuse multiple data sources to holistically describe both the hard skills and\nsoft traits of each person,\u201d Mr Huang shares. \u201cOur AI gathers information\nabout candidates and employees from CVs, psychometric assessments, video\ninterviews, social media, etc.\u201d\n\nAlgorithms designed by Pulsifi\u2019s people science team \u2013 comprising data science\nand organisational psychology experts and PhD holders \u2013 then use the data to\nunderstand hard skills and soft traits \u2013 such as competencies, personality,\nwork interests and work culture \u2013 and reveal predicted behaviours and\nattitudes of people, such as motivation to learn, grit and teamwork.\n\nThis holistic insight presented is something that is not possible from just\nlooking at one\u2019s LinkedIn account or even through an interview; and the data\nis explained to the client rather than just looked at blindly.\n\nMr Huang adds that Pulsifi\u2019s other uniqueness lies in how it tailors\nalgorithms for each organisation: \u201cWe partner organisations to benchmark their\nemployees \u2013 analysing employee performance, engagement and retention data, and\ndetermining the specific hard skills and soft traits that predict success in\neach role in the organisation.\u201d\n\n**SUCCESS RATE**\n\nThe proof is in the pudding, and Pulsifi says that it has delivered \u201con\naverage over 100 per cent improvement in candidate selection quality and over\n70 per cent improvement in operational efficiency \u2013 as well as succession\nplanning, internal mobility, teaming, and learning and development\u201d to its\nclients which include Nestl\u00e9 and Reckitt Benckiser.\n\nSimilarly, Singapore\u2019s largest home-grown women\u2019s fashion brand Love, Bonito\nhas adopted EngageRocket\u2019s solution as the company wanted a cost- effective\nand intuitive way to scale quickly. Its workforce grew by 50 per cent last\nyear with the headcount now standing at 150. That number is set to increase by\nthe same increment by the end of 2019.\n\nLove, Bonito also aims to align customer and employee experience using data.\nBrandon Lee, head of People & Culture (P&C) at Love, Bonito shares: \u201cWe\nstrongly believe our employees\u2019 experience should reflect the one we are\ntrying to provide to our customers. We are investing time, effort and money\ntrying to understand our customers, measuring their satisfaction and\npersonalising their journey \u2013 it\u2019s only right that we want the same for our\n(employees).\u201d Adopting HR tech also allows Love, Bonito to keep operations\nlean and is \u201cone initiative in a greater push towards open feedback and omni-\nchannel communication within the organisation\u201d, he adds. In this way, the\ncompany hopes to crowdsource feedback, suggestions and ideas for policy-making\nand company-wide initiatives.\n\n\u201cHaving a lean P&C team means that we have to place bets and roll out\ninitiatives that are most relevant \u2013 having consistent employee feedback means\nwe don\u2019t have to place bets blindfolded,\u201d explains Mr Lee.\n\n**STILL HUMAN**\n\nContrary to those who fear that digitisation equals robots taking over jobs,\nthe use of HR technology is anything but that. Pulsifi\u2019s Mr Huang clarifies:\n\u201cWe help to put the \u2018human\u2019 back in \u2018human resources\u2019 (and) help HR do what\nthey really want to do better.\u201d\n\nHe adds that HR managers will spend much less time on repetitive tasks such as\nscreening job applicants and candidates, or compiling candidate profiles from\ndisparate data sources with Pulsifi\u2019s AI.\n\n\u201cThey (will) have much more time to invest in areas where the human touch is\nvaluable, such as convincing candidates to join the organisation, coaching\nemployees for learning and development, and strategic people planning for the\norganisation.\u201d The technology has also improved leaps and bounds since Google,\none of the pioneers in people analytics, tested it as Projected Oxygen a\ndecade ago.\n\nAlthough EngageRocket\u2019s Mr Leong admits that it is still a \u201crelatively nascent\nfield in Asia\u201d, the company is excited to be at the forefront. \u201cNew\nmethodologies and tools have proliferated with Web and mobile applications\noperating in a far more agile and responsive infrastructure,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWhat is clear is that with continuous listening systems maturing, and data\nflows between silos become more flexible, it is very likely that HR will\nrapidly transition across the value chain from descriptive to diagnostic to\npredictive and eventually prescriptive analytics within the next few years.\u201d\n\nPulsifi\u2019s Mr Huang says that he is encouraged to see organisations moving\nhiring criteria away from just scanning a jobseeker\u2019s CV and relying on gut\nfeel which could not only lead to bias and unfairness but also limit the\npotential of the hire. \u201cWe see this as a sign that (they) are keen to\nunderstand people more holistically, and hire people for the traits that lead\nto success in their roles . . . after all, prior roles, education and grades\nare seldom the only contributors to success in jobs,\u201d he notes.\n\nHe goes as far as to predict that the future of any industry lies in analytics\nand data. \u201cTechnology has become so integral in every part of our lives today\nthat we seldom call it out as technology anymore; (and) in the near future, we\nwould similarly not be calling analytics out anymore.\u201d\n\n**ACTIVITY-BASED WORKING**\n\nBut going the high-tech route is not the only way that HR is coping with the\nfuture of work. As early as 1989, Erik Veldhoen popularised the concept of\nactivity-based working (ABW). His integrated consultancy firm Veldhoen +\nCompany opened its sixth office \u2013 and the first in Asia \u2013 in Singapore two\nyears ago to meet the demands of the rapidly evolving business landscape and\nemployee needs in the region.\n\nGoing against the typical nine-to-five office culture, ABW is based on the\nphilosophy that people should be trusted and empowered to work anytime\nanywhere in order to do their best work. It goes beyond just hot desking or\ndesigning an open concept office \u2013 ABW is a business strategy that re-\nimagines traditional practices to engage people at the workplace and gives\nemployees the freedom of choice to decide how he or she works to achieve the\nbest outcome. In short, it transforms work into something that you feel\nempowered to do, rather than somewhere you need to be.\n\nManaging partner (South-east Asia and Japan) of Veldhoen + Company Iolanda\nMeehan, who is heading the new Singapore office, says that the role of HR is\n\u201ccrucial\u201d in ABW and it needs to be at the table when the discussions are\nhappening to support employees through the transformation. More importantly,\nHR professionals must not see ABW as merely a real estate project or feel that\nthey are to police things, she says.\n\n\u201cIn ABW, a culture of feedback is very important, so the HR team doesn\u2019t\nbecome the enforcers of ABW but rather the facilitators of transformation . .\n. If carried out properly, an ABW transformation is fully co-created with\nemployees, every step of the way,\u201d Ms Meehan stresses.\n\nSennheiser\u2019s Singapore office recently integrated ABW in its new office in a\nbid to encourage a team-oriented approach towards working. Martin Low,\nmanaging director at Sennheiser Electronic Asia, says: \u201cIt drives home the\ntransition from a \u2018me\u2019 to \u2018we\u2019 mentality at work, which encourages trust among\ncolleagues while fostering camaraderie.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the intelligent use of natural lighting complimented with\ntechnological innovation, for instance, has given rise to energy levels around\nthe office as greater collaboration and communication now take place daily. He\nalso notes that the removal of silos has also radically transformed working\nstyles and brainstorming sessions \u2013 and even Sennheiser\u2019s customers do not\nmind staying on a little longer for discussions.\n\nThe journey involved a close collaboration between HR, business, IT and real\nestate, according to Ms Meehan. \u201cSince the changes were not mainly about the\nenvironment but around driving a more interactive and empowered behaviour, HR\nplayed a key role in the entire process by participating in all employee co-\ncreation workshops, gathering insights and acting like a change agent\ninternally,\u201d she says. She adds that a number of HR policies were revisited,\nas well as the overall employer value proposition for attraction and retention\nof talent.\n\nRegardless whether a company decides to adopt ABW or HR technology, the bottom\nline remains the same: attract talent and retain staff. \u201cEmployees are a\ncompany\u2019s greatest asset, so it only makes sense that robust decision support\ntools are used in managing such an asset,\u201d states EngageRocket\u2019s Mr Leong.\n\n\u201cAs each individual seeks to realise their unique potential in the workforce\nand companies seek to maximise their return on labour, technology and\nanalytics play an important role as an intermediary to support the goals of\nboth parties.\u201d He adds: \u201cNot only would staff be more loyal and happier as\nthey pursue and realise their career aspirations, companies will be able to\nreap the benefits of a more productive workforce.\u201d\n\n[![](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/sites/default/files/article-\ntelegram.png)](https://t.me/BizTimes)\n\n## [BREAKING NEWS](/breaking-news)\n\n07:11 AM\n\nApr 8, 2020 07:11

Today, Workplace,\nFacebook's effort in that race, announced a milestone in its growth, along\nwith a bigger push into video services and other improvements.\n\nThe service -- which starts at $1.50 per month per front-line worker and then\nhas tiers of $4 and $8 -- now has passed 3 million paying users, adding 1\nmillion workers from mostly enterprise businesses in the [last eight\nmonths](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/28/facebook-says-that-workplace-now-\nhas-2m-paying-users/).\n\nAnd to capitalize on [Facebook's\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook) growing focus on video in its\nconsumer service, Workplace is announcing several steps of its own into video.\nIt's releasing a special app that can be used on the Portal, Facebook's video\nscreen; and alongside that, it's announcing new video features: captioning at\nthe bottom of videos; auto-translating starting with 14 languages; and a new\nP2P architecture that will speed up video transmission for those who might be\nwatching videos on Workplace in places where bandwidth is constrained.\n\nThe features and milestone number are all being announced today at Flock, the\nWorkplace user conference that Facebook puts on each year. Alongside all\nthese, Facebook also announced several other features for its enterprise app\n(more on the other new features below).\n\nThe push to video comes at an interesting time for Workplace on the\ncompetitive front. Karandeep Anand, who came to Facebook from\n[Microsoft](https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft) and currently heads\nup Workplace with Julien Codorniou managing business development, has made a\npoint of differentiating Workplace from others in the field of workplace\ncollaboration by emphasizing how it's used by very large enterprises like\nWalmart (the world's largest single employer) to bring together on to a single\ncommunication platform not just white-collar knowledge workers but also\nfrontline workers.\n\nThe company says that today, its customers include 150 companies with over\n10,000 active users apiece, with other names on its books including Starbucks,\nSpotify, AstraZeneca, Deliveroo and Kering.\n\nThe push to video follows that trajectory: it's a way for Workplace (and\nFacebook) to differentiate the experience and use cases for the product to\nbusinesses, which might already be using Slack but might consider buying this\nas well, if not migrating away from the other product altogether. (Teams is a\ndifferent ballgame, of course, as it has a strong video component of its own\nand also likes to position itself as a product for all kinds of employees,\ntoo.)\n\nWorkplace's video efforts here will mark the first time that Facebook is\npositioning Portal as a product for businesses. This is notable, when you\nconsider there has been some adoption of [Amazon's Alexa in workplace\nscenarios](https://aws.amazon.com/alexaforbusiness/), too; and that there has\nbeen [some pushback](https://marketingland.com/privacy-could-be-hurting-\nfacebook-portal-sales-260077) from consumers about the prospect of having a\nFacebook video device sitting in their homes. This gives Facebook's $179\nhardware (which will be sold at the same price to businesses) a new avenue for\nsales.\n\nVideo has been a cornerstone of how Workplace has been developing for a while\nnow, with companies using it as a way for, say, the big boss to send out more\npersonalised communications to workers, and for people in workgroups to create\nvideo chats with each other. A dedicated screen for video chats takes this\nidea to the next level, and plays on the fact that video conferencing services\nlike Zoom have caught on like wildfire in modern offices, where people who\nwork together often work in disparate locations.\n\nThere is another way that Portal could find some traction with businesses:\nvideoconferencing solutions tend to be very expensive, in part because of the\nhefty hardware investments that need to be made. Offering a device at $179\ndrastically undercuts that investment. Codorniou declined to comment on\nwhether Facebook might make a more concerted effort to push this as a cost-\neffective videoconferencing alternative down the line, but he did point out\nthat today Facebook and Zoom have a close relationship.\n\nThe other video features that Workplace is announcing today will further\nenhance the experience: Facebook will now give users the option to include\nautomatic captions at the bottoms of videos, with the bonus of translation,\ninitially in 14 languages. And the improved video quality for those with\nlimited bandwidth is significantly not something that Facebook has rolled out\nin its consumer app: the aim is to improve the quality of broadcasting in\nscenarios where bandwidth might not be as strong but there are simultaneous\npeople watching the same event -- something you could imagine applying, say,\nat a company all-hands or town hall event with remote participants.\n\nAlongside all of these video features, Workplace is adding in a host of other\nfeatures to expand the use cases for the product beyond basic chatting:\n\n  * New learning product. This is not about e-learning per se, but Workplace is now offering a way for HR to add onboarding teaching and videos into Workplace for new employees or new services at the company. There are no plans right now to expand this to educational content, Codorniou said.\n  * Surveys are also coming to Workplace. These will be set by administrators -- not any worker at any time -- and it seems that for now there will be no anonymity, so that will mean it's unlikely that these will cover any sensitive topics, and might in any case see a chilling effect in how people feel they can respond.\n  * Frontline access is getting overhauled in Workplace, where people who do not use company email addresses will now be able to create accounts using generated codes.\n  * Those admins that are trying to track how well Workplace is actually working for them will also be able to track engagement and other metrics on the platform.\n\nWorkplace is also adding in some gamification features to the platform, where\npeople can publicly thank people, set and follow workplace goals and award\nbadges to individuals who have achieved something in areas like sales,\nanniversaries or other positive milestones.\n\nAs with the video features, the idea is to bring services to Workplace that\nyou are not necessarily getting in Slack and other competitive products. That\nis the maxim also when the features are replicas of features you might have\nseen elsewhere, but not all in one consolidated place.\n\nAsked what he thought about the claims that Facebook is too much of a\n\"copycat\" when it came to building new features, Codorniou was defensive. \"I\nthink Workplace itself is getting to a market that has been untouched before.\nWhen it comes to badges or goals, for example, yes people have but these\nbefore, but the difference is that we are offering them to a wide network of\npeople. If you have to use a separate app, it's not a great experience.\"\n\nAnd, he added, \"everything that we ship is the result of customer feedback and\nrequests. If they tell us they want these, it means they're not finding what\nthey needed on the market.\"\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "HR Tech

analyst discussed some of the biggest challenges and\nopportunities in HR technology.\n\nBy: [Andrew R. McIlvaine](https://hrexecutive.com/author/andrew-r-mcilvaine/\n\"Posts by Andrew R. McIlvaine\") | October 2, 2019 \u2022 4 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [HR\nTechnology Conference News](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-\ntechnology-conference/) | [Top Stories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-\nstories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Bersin-700x467.jpg)\n\nIndustry leader Josh Bersin delivered the opening keynote address Wednesday\nmorning at HR Tech at the Venetian in Las Vegas.\n\nIf HR Tech attendees felt a bit overwhelmed going into the Expo hall with more\nthan 500 exhibitors, Josh Bersin wanted them to know he feels their pain.\n\n\"I've been an analyst in this space for over 20 years, and I have a lot of\nrespect for the vendors in this space, but you as HR leaders have to make\nsense of all this and so many of you have told me there are just so many\noptions,\" said the global industry analyst, who delivered the opening keynote\non the second day of HR Tech.\n\n[**VIDEO: See Josh Bersin 's interview about his report with\n_HRE_.**](https://hrexecutive.com/watch-josh-bersin-talks-hr-tech-trends/)\n\nThe title of Bersin's presentation, \"Untangling the HR Technology Market,\"\nreflects the sheer volume of activity that's been swirling in the space for\nthe past 10 years. Boosted by billions in venture capital funding, the market\nalso reflects the fact that the very nature of work is changing, he said.\n\n\"The job market is hot and yet we also have this problem of lagging\nproductivity,\" said Bersin. \"This gap is getting bigger and it's born by the\nstress, workload, engagement and health and sleep of employees. So there's\nthis huge market for HR tech as wellbeing, engagement, productivity and\nretention become core, rather than nice-to-haves.\"\n\n[**HR Tech 2019: How agile innovated Walmart 's\nhiring**](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-how-agile-innovated-walmarts-\nhiring/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Josh-\nBersin-150x150.jpg)\n\nJosh Bersin\n\nThe latest research shows CEOs are more concerned than ever about growth and\nthat they want more creativity out of their people. \"'Curiosity is actually\nbecoming a competency,\" he said.\n\nEmployees, meanwhile, are very concerned about their jobs and careers.\n\"They're saying 'If I join your company, what am I going to get out of it for\nmy career? And that's created a new demand within the organization for\ncontinuous learning.\"\n\nMost importantly, \"we're not building software for HR anymore\u2014we're building\nit for employees,\" said Bersin. \"If employees don't find it useful, if it\ndoesn't fit into 'the flow of work,' then it's not going to be used.\"\n\n**[More from HR Tech: Follow along here for our ongoing\ncoverage.](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/hr-technology-\nconference/)**\n\n**Employee Experience is Primary**\n\nOne of the most fundamental changes in the industry is the primacy of employee\nexperience, said Bersin. \"HR is now the secondary audience\u2014employees are the\nprimary audience. And that's shifted the market.\"\n\nVendors are focusing their attention on \"employee-centric tools\" that operate\nwithin Microsoft Outlook, Slack, Salesforce and other widely used tools, he\nsaid. \"That's the big existential thing the tech community is working on. And\nthat means there are going to be some winners and losers in the marketplace.\"\n\n**[HR Tech 2019: Five key lessons from Barbara\nCorcoran](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-5-hr-lessons-from-barbara-\ncorcoran/)**\n\nThe major vendors are trying to push themselves into the employee experience\ncategory, said Bersin.\n\n\"In the early days when I got into HR tech, there was a very clear strategy\nthat you'd go to ADP, PeopleSoft, and that was it,\" he said. \"Now we're in a\nmuch different situation. HR tech platforms at the core are becoming more like\nyour phone\u2014more like platforms in which you put apps in, and you delete apps.\nIf the apps don't take off, just shut them down. And that's the way the world\nis now\u2014someone's going to build something and you'll say 'My God, we need\nthat.' And you'll try it and it'll be great, or it won't work out and you'll\njust turn it off.\"\n\nOn top of that is the talent space and there \"We have an incredible array of\ntechnologies,\" said Bersin.\n\nTalent management vendors need to keep the following in mind, he said: \"You\nneed to think about not what you think is going to be cool, but what are the\nmanagement philosophies that are trending, and those are growth, development,\njob mobility, highly diverse, highly inclusive talent practices, transparency,\nnetwork effect\u2014those are the things senior leaders are talking about.\"\n\n**AI and Recruiting**\n\nThe area of HR tech that's the most dynamic is recruiting, said Bersin.\n\n\"AI is probably more mature in recruiting than any other part of HR,\" he said.\n\n[**HR Tech 2019: Findings** **from the just-released Sierra-Cedar\nreport**](https://hrexecutive.com/new-sierra-cedar-report-what-should-happen-\nafter-the-hr-tech-buy-in/)\n\nDiversity and inclusion has become so important that's now a significant\nmarket in its own, said Bersin. \"You can now use AI to identify biased\ninterviewing, sourcing and recruiting practices. You can at least see them and\ndo something about them.\"\n\nAI is becoming ubiquitous in HR technology, he said. \"It's hard to build an HR\nplatform of any kind without designing some kind of AI solution. AI is now\ngoing mainstream.\"\n\nVendors like Pymetrics, PhenomPeople, IBM, Oracle, Workday, HireVue are all\nincorporating AI into their products, said Bersin.\n\nFinally, employee experience platforms are big in the HR tech market.\n\n\"Vendors like ServiceNow, Deloitte, Mercer, SAP SuccessFactors, IBM, all have\nplatforms focused on the employee experience,\" he said. \"You can't expect out-\nof-the box ERP to do this. This is going to be a significant market.\"\n\nAndrew R.

As a consequence,\nhiring extraordinary talent is vital to our success and can never be taken for\ngranted. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we faced a challenge that\nwas, frankly, relatively new to our now 150-year-old firm. For decades\ninvestment banking had been one of the most sought-after, exciting, and fast-\ngrowing industries in the world. That made sense--we were growing by double\ndigits and had high returns, which meant that opportunity and reward were in\ngreat supply. However, the crash took some of the sheen off our industry; both\ngrowth and returns moderated. And simultaneously, the battle for talent\nintensified--within and outside our industry. Many of the candidates we were\npursuing were heading off to Silicon Valley, private equity, or start-ups.\nFurthermore, we were no longer principally looking for a specialized cadre of\naccounting, finance, and economics majors: New skills, especially coding, were\nin huge demand at Goldman Sachs--and pretty much everywhere else. The wind had\nshifted from our backs to our faces, and we needed to respond.\n\nRelated Video\n\n  * [__Save](/video/6026736199001)\n  * [__Share](/video/6026736199001)\n\nNot long ago the firm relied on a narrower set of factors for identifying \"the\nbest\" students, such as school, GPA, major, leadership roles, and relevant\nexperience--the classic resume topics. No longer. We decided to replace our\nhiring playbook with emerging best practices for assessment and recruitment,\nso we put together a task force of senior business leaders, PhDs in industrial\nand organizational psychology, data scientists, and experts in recruiting.\nSome people asked, \"Why overhaul a recruiting process that has proved so\nsuccessful?\" and \"Don't you already have many more qualified applicants than\navailable jobs?\" These were reasonable questions. But often staying successful\nis about learning and changing rather than sticking to the tried-and-true.\n\nEach year we hire up to 3,000 summer interns and nearly as many new analysts\ndirectly from campuses. In our eyes, these are the firm's future leaders, so\nit made sense to focus our initial reforms there. They involved two major\nadditions to our campus recruiting strategy--video interviews and structured\ninterviewing.\n\n### Asynchronous video interviews.\n\nTraditionally we had flown recruiters and business professionals to\nuniversities for first-round interviews. The schools would give us a set date\nand number of time slots to meet with students. That is most definitely not a\nscalable model. It restricted us to a smaller number of campuses and only as\nmany students as we could squeeze into a limited schedule. It also meant that\nwe tended to focus on top-ranked schools. How many qualified candidates were\nat a school became more important than who were the most talented students\nregardless of their school. However, we knew that candidates didn't have to\nattend Harvard, Princeton, or Oxford to excel at Goldman Sachs--our leadership\nranks were already rich with people from other schools. What's more, as we've\nbuilt offices in new cities and geographic locations, we've needed to recruit\nat more schools located in those areas. Video interviews allow us to do that.\n\nAt a time when companies were just beginning to experiment with digital\ninterviewing, we decided to use \"asynchronous\" video interviews--in which\ncandidates record their answers to interview questions--for all first-round\ninteractions with candidates. Our recruiters record standardized questions and\nsend them to students, who have three days to return videos of their answers.\nThis can be done on a computer or a mobile device. Our recruiters and business\nprofessionals review the videos to narrow the pool and then invite the\nselected applicants to a Goldman Sachs office for final-round, in-person\ninterviews. (To create the video platform, we partnered with a company and\nbuilt our own digital solution around its product.)\n\nThis approach has had a meaningful impact in two ways. First, with limited\neffort, we can now spend more time getting to know the people who apply for\njobs at Goldman Sachs. In 2015, the year before we rolled out this platform,\nwe interviewed fewer than 20% of all our campus applicants; in 2018 almost 40%\nof the students who applied to the firm participated in a first-round\ninterview. Second, we now encounter talent from places we previously didn't\nget to. In 2015 we interviewed students from 798 schools around the world,\ncompared with 1,268 for our most recent incoming class. In the United States,\nwhere the majority of our student hires historically came from \"target\nschools,\" the opposite is now true. The top of our recruiting funnel is wider,\nand the output is more diverse.\n\nBeing a people-driven business, we have worked hard to ensure that the video\ninterviews don't feel cold and impersonal. They are only one component of a\nbroader process that makes up the Goldman Sachs recruitment experience. We\nstill regularly send Goldman professionals to campuses to engage directly with\nstudents at informational sessions, \"coffee chats,\" and other recruiting\nevents. But now our goal is much more to share information than to assess\ncandidates, because we want people to understand the firm and what it offers\nbefore they tell us why they want an internship or a job.\n\nOur structured interview questions are designed to assess 10 core\ncompetencies.\n\nWe also want them to be as well prepared as possible for our interview\nprocess. Our goal is a level playing field. To help achieve it, we've created\ntip sheets and instructions on preparing for a video interview. Because the\nplatform doesn't allow videos to be edited once they've been recorded, we\noffer a practice question before the interview begins and a countdown before\nthe questions are asked. We also give students a formal channel for escalating\nissues should technical problems arise, though that rarely occurs.\n\nWe're confident that this approach has created a better experience for\nrecruits. It uses a medium they've grown up with (video), and most important,\nthey can do their interviews when they feel fresh and at a time that works\nwith their schedule. (Our data shows that they prefer Thursday or Sunday night\n--whereas our previous practice was to interview during working hours.) We\nsuspected that if the process was a turnoff for applicants, we would see a dip\nin the percentage who accepted our interviews and our offers. That hasn't\nhappened.\n\n### Structured questioning and assessments.\n\nHow can you create an assessment process that not only helps select top talent\nbut focuses on specific characteristics associated with success? Define it,\nstructure it, and don't deviate from it. Research shows that structured\ninterviews are effective at assessing candidates and helping predict job\nperformance. So we ask candidates about specific experiences they've had that\nare similar to situations they may face at Goldman Sachs (\"Tell me about a\ntime when you were working on a project with someone who was not completing\nhis or her tasks\") and pose hypothetical scenarios they might encounter in the\nfuture (\"In an elevator, you overhear confidential information about a\ncoworker who is also a friend. The friend approaches you and asks if you've\nheard anything negative about him recently. What do you do?\").\n\nEssentially, we are focused less on past achievements and more on\nunderstanding whether a candidate has qualities that will positively affect\nour firm and our culture. Our structured interview questions are designed to\nassess candidates on 10 core competencies, including analytical thinking and\nintegrity, which we know correlate with long-term success at the firm. They\nare evaluated on six competencies in the first round; if they progress,\nthey're assessed on the remaining four during in-person interviews.\n\nWe have a rotating library of questions for each competency, along with a\nrubric for interviewers that explains how to rate responses on a five-point\nscale from \"outstanding\" to \"poor.\" We also train our interviewers to conduct\nstructured interviews, provide them with prep materials immediately before\nthey interview a candidate, and run detailed calibration meetings using all\nthe candidate data we've gathered throughout the recruiting process to ensure\nthat certain interviewers aren't introducing grade inflation (or deflation).\nWe're experimenting with prehire assessment tests to be paired with these\ninterviews; we already offer a technical coding and math exam for applicants\nto our engineering organization.\n\nWe decided not to pilot these changes and instead rolled them out en masse,\nbecause we realized that buy-in would come from being able to show results\nquickly--and because we know that no process is perfect. Indeed, what I love\nmost about our new approach is that we've turned our recruiting department\ninto a laboratory for continuous learning and refinement. With more than\n50,000 candidate video recordings, we're now sitting on a treasure trove of\ndata that will help us conduct insightful analyses and answer questions\nnecessary to run our business: Are we measuring the right competencies? Should\nsome be weighted more heavily than others? What about the candidates'\nbackgrounds? Which interviewers are most effective? Does a top-ranked student\nat a state school create more value for us than an average student from the\nIvy League? We already have indications that students recruited from the new\nschools in our pool perform just as well as students from our traditional ones\n--and in some cases are more likely to stay longer at the firm.\n\nWhat's next for our recruiting efforts? We receive almost 500,000 applications\neach year. From this pool we hire approximately 3%. We believe that many of\nthe other 97% could be very successful at Goldman Sachs. As a result, picking\nthe right 3% is less about just the individual and increasingly about matching\nthe right person to the right role. That match may be made straight out of\ncollege or years later. We're experimenting with resume-reading algorithms\nthat will help candidates identify the business departments best suited to\ntheir skills and interests. We're looking at how virtual reality might help us\nbetter educate students about working in our offices and in our industry. And\nwe're evaluating various tools and tests to bring even more data into the\nhiring decision process. Can I imagine a future in which companies rely\nexclusively on machines and algorithms to rate resumes and interviews? Maybe,\nfor some. But I don't see us ever eliminating the human element at Goldman\nSachs; it's too deeply embedded in our culture, in the work we do, and in what\nwe believe drives success.\n\nI'm excited to see where this journey takes us. Our 2019 campus class is\nshaping up to be the most diverse ever--and it's composed entirely of people\nwho were selected through rigorous, objective assessments. There's no way we\naren't better off as a result.\n\n## Your Approach to Hiring Is All Wrong\n\n  * [Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter%20cappelli)\n\n  * __Save\n  * __Share\n\n#### Idea in Brief\n\n##### The Problem\n\nEmployers continue to hire at a high rate and spend enormous sums to do it.\nBut they don't know whether their approaches are effective at finding and\nselecting good candidates.\n\n##### The Root Causes\n\nBusinesses focus on external candidates and don't track the results of their\napproaches. They often use outside vendors and high-tech tools that are\nunproven and have inherent flaws.\n\n##### The Solution\n\nReturn to filling most positions by promoting from within. Measure the results\nproduced by vendors and new tools, and be on the lookout for discrimination\nand privacy violations.\n\nBusinesses have never done as much hiring as they do today. They've never\nspent as much money doing it. And they've never done a worse job of it.\n\nFor most of the post-World War II era, large corporations went about hiring\nthis way: Human resources experts prepared a detailed _job analysis_ to\ndetermine what tasks the job required and what attributes a good candidate\nshould have. Next they did a _job evaluation_ to determine how the job fit\ninto the organizational chart and how much it should pay, especially compared\nwith other jobs. Ads were posted, and applicants applied. Then came the task\nof sorting through the applicants. That included skills tests, reference\nchecks, maybe personality and IQ tests, and extensive interviews to learn more\nabout them as people. William H. Whyte, in The Organization Man, described\nthis process as going on for as long as a week before the winning candidate\nwas offered the job. The vast majority of non-entry-level openings were filled\nfrom within.\n\nToday's approach couldn't be more different. Census data shows, for example,\nthat the majority of people who took a new job last year weren't searching for\none: Somebody came and got them. Companies seek to fill their recruiting\nfunnel with as many candidates as possible, especially \"passive candidates,\"\nwho aren't looking to move. Often employers advertise jobs that don't exist,\nhoping to find people who might be useful later on or in a different context.\n\nThe recruiting and hiring function has been eviscerated. Many U.S. companies--\nabout 40%, according to\n[research](https://staging.kornferry.com/media/sidebar_downloads/Measuring-Up-\nA-new-research-report-about-RPO-metrics.pdf) by Korn Ferry--have outsourced\nmuch if not all of the hiring process to \"recruitment process outsourcers,\"\nwhich in turn often use subcontractors, typically in India and the\nPhilippines. The subcontractors scour LinkedIn and social media to find\npotential candidates. They sometimes contact them directly to see whether they\ncan be persuaded to apply for a position and negotiate the salary they're\nwilling to accept. (The recruiters get incentive pay if they negotiate the\namount down.) To hire programmers, for example, these subcontractors can scan\nwebsites that programmers might visit, trace their \"digital exhaust\" from\ncookies and other user-tracking measures to identify who they are, and then\nexamine their curricula vitae.\n\nAt companies that still do their own recruitment and hiring, managers trying\nto fill open positions are largely left to figure out what the jobs require\nand what the ads should say. When applications come--always electronically--\napplicant-tracking software sifts through them for key words that the hiring\nmanagers want to see. Then the process moves into the Wild West, where a new\nindustry of vendors offer an astonishing array of smart-sounding tools that\nclaim to predict who will be a good hire. They use voice recognition, body\nlanguage, clues on social media, and especially machine learning algorithms--\neverything but tea leaves. Entire publications are devoted to what these\nvendors are doing.\n\nThe big problem with all these new practices is that we don't know whether\nthey actually produce satisfactory hires. Only about a third of U.S. companies\nreport that they monitor whether their hiring practices lead to good\nemployees; few of them do so carefully, and only a minority even track cost\nper hire and time to hire. Imagine if the CEO asked how an advertising\ncampaign had gone, and the response was \"We have a good idea how long it took\nto roll out and what it cost, but we haven't looked to see whether we're\nselling more.\"\n\nHiring talent remains the number one concern of CEOs in the most recent\nConference Board Annual Survey; it's also the top concern of the entire\nexecutive suite. PwC's 2017 CEO survey reports that chief executives view the\nunavailability of talent and skills as the biggest threat to their business.\nEmployers also spend an enormous amount on hiring--an average of $4,129 per\njob in the United States, according to Society for Human Resource Management\nestimates, and many times that amount for managerial roles--and the United\nStates fills a staggering 66 million jobs a year. Most of the $20 billion that\ncompanies spend on human resources vendors goes to hiring.\n\nWhy do employers spend so much on something so important while knowing so\nlittle about whether it works?\n\n## Where the Problem Starts\n\nSurvey after survey finds employers complaining about how difficult hiring is.\nThere may be many explanations, such as their having become very picky about\ncandidates, especially in the slack labor market of the Great Recession. But\nclearly they are hiring much more than at any other time in modern history,\nfor two reasons.\n\nThe first is that openings are now filled more often by hiring from the\noutside than by promoting from within. In the era of lifetime employment, from\nthe end of World War II through the 1970s, corporations filled roughly 90% of\ntheir vacancies through promotions and lateral assignments. Today the figure\nis a third or less. When they hire from outside, organizations don't have to\npay to train and develop their employees. Since the restructuring waves of the\nearly 1980s, it has been relatively easy to find experienced talent outside.\nOnly 28% of talent acquisition leaders today report that internal candidates\nare an important source of people to fill vacancies--presumably because of\nless internal development and fewer clear career ladders.\n\nLess promotion internally means that hiring efforts are no longer concentrated\non entry-level jobs and recent graduates. (If you doubt this, go to the\n\"careers\" link on any company website and look for a job opening that doesn't\nrequire prior experience.) Now companies must be good at hiring across most\nlevels, because the candidates they want are already doing the job somewhere\nelse. These people don't need training, so they may be ready to contribute\nright away, but they are much harder to find.\n\nThe second reason hiring is so difficult is that retention has become tough:\nCompanies hire from their competitors and vice versa, so they have to keep\nreplacing people who leave. Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows\nthat 95% of hiring is done to fill existing positions. Most of those vacancies\nare caused by voluntary turnover. LinkedIn data indicates that the most common\nreason employees consider a position elsewhere is career advancement--which is\nsurely related to employers' not promoting to fill vacancies.\n\nThe root cause of most hiring, therefore, is drastically poor retention. Here\nare some simple ways to fix that:\n\n### Track the percentage of openings filled from within.\n\nAn adage of business is that we manage what we measure, but companies don't\nseem to be applying that maxim to tracking hires. Most are shocked to learn\nhow few of their openings are filled from within--is it really the case that\ntheir people can't handle different and bigger roles?\n\n### Require that all openings be posted internally.\n\nInternal job boards were created during the dot-com boom to reduce turnover by\nmaking it easier for people to find new jobs within their existing employer.\nManagers weren't even allowed to know if a subordinate was looking to move\nwithin the company, for fear that they would try to block that person and he\nor she would leave. But during the Great Recession employees weren't quitting,\nand many companies slid back to the old model whereby managers could prevent\ntheir subordinates from moving internally. JR Keller, of Cornell University,\nhas found that when managers could fill a vacancy with someone they already\nhad in mind, they ended up with employees who performed more poorly than those\nhired when the job had been posted and anyone could apply. The commonsense\nexplanation for this is that few enterprises really know what talent and\ncapabilities they have.\n\n#### Protecting Against Discrimination\n\nFinding out whether your practices result in good hires is not only basic to\ngood management but the only real defense against claims of adverse impact and\ndiscrimination. Other than white males under age 40 with no disabilities or\nwork-related health problems, workers have special protections under federal\nand state laws against hiring practices that may have an adverse impact on\nthem. As a practical matter, that means if members of a particular group are\nless likely to be recruited or hired, the employer must show that the hiring\nprocess is not discriminatory.\n\nThe only defense against evidence of adverse impact is for the employer to\nshow that its hiring practices are valid--that is, they predict who will be a\ngood employee in meaningful and statistically significant ways--and that no\nalternative would predict as well with less adverse impact. That analysis must\nbe conducted with data on the employer's own applicants and hires. The fact\nthat the vendor that sold you the test you use has evidence that it was valid\nin other contexts is not sufficient.\n\n### Recognize the costs of outside hiring.\n\nIn addition to the time and effort of hiring, my colleague Matthew Bidwell\nfound, outside hires take three years to perform as well as internal hires in\nthe same job, while internal hires take seven years to earn as much as outside\nhires are paid. Outside hiring also causes current employees to spend time and\nenergy positioning themselves for jobs elsewhere. It disrupts the culture and\nburdens peers who must help new hires figure out how things work.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that outside hiring is necessarily a bad idea. But\nunless your company is a Silicon Valley gazelle, adding new jobs at a furious\npace, you should ask yourself some serious questions if most of your openings\nare being filled from outside.\n\nEmployers are obsessed with new technologies and driving down costs.\n\nA different approach for dealing with retention (which seems creepy to some)\nis to try to determine who is interested in leaving and then intervene.\nVendors like Jobvite comb social media and public sites for clues, such as\nLinkedIn profile updates. Measuring \"flight risk\" is one of the most common\ngoals of companies that do their own sophisticated HR analytics. This is\nreminiscent of the early days of job boards, when employers would try to find\nout who was posting resumes and either punish them or embrace them, depending\non leadership's mood.\n\nWhether companies should be examining social media content in relation to\nhiring or any other employment action is a challenging ethical question. On\none hand, the information is essentially public and may reveal relevant\ninformation. On the other hand, it is invasive, and candidates are rarely\nasked for permission to scrutinize their information. Hiring a private\ndetective to shadow a candidate would also gather public information that\nmight be relevant, yet most people would view it as an unacceptable invasion\nof privacy.\n\n## The Hiring Process\n\nWhen we turn to hiring itself, we find that employers are missing the forest\nfor the trees: Obsessed with new technologies and driving down costs, they\nlargely ignore the ultimate goal: making the best possible hires. Here's how\nthe process should be revamped:\n\n### Don't post \"phantom jobs.\"\n\nIt costs nothing to post job openings on a company website, which are then\nscooped up by Indeed and other online companies and pushed out to potential\njob seekers around the world. Thus it may be unsurprising that some of these\njobs don't really exist. Employers may simply be fishing for candidates.\n(\"Let's see if someone really great is out there, and if so, we'll create a\nposition for him or her.\") Often job ads stay up even after positions have\nbeen filled, to keep collecting candidates for future vacancies or just\nbecause it takes more effort to pull the ad down than to leave it up.\nSometimes ads are posted by unscrupulous recruiters looking for resumes to\npitch to clients elsewhere. Because these phantom jobs make the labor market\nlook tighter than it really is, they are a problem for economic policy makers\nas well as for frustrated job seekers. Companies should take ads down when\njobs are filled.\n\n### Design jobs with realistic requirements.\n\nFiguring out what the requirements of a job should be--and the corresponding\nattributes candidates must have--is a bigger challenge now, because so many\ncompanies have reduced the number of internal recruiters whose function, in\npart, is to push back on hiring managers' wish lists. (\"That job doesn't\nrequire 10 years of experience,\" or \"No one with all those qualifications will\nbe willing to accept the salary you're proposing to pay.\") My earlier research\nfound that companies piled on job requirements, baked them into the applicant-\ntracking software that sorted resumes according to binary decisions (yes, it\nhas the key word; no, it doesn't), and then found that virtually no applicants\nmet all the criteria. Trimming recruiters, who have expertise in hiring, and\nhanding the process over to hiring managers is a prime example of being penny-\nwise and pound-foolish.\n\n### Reconsider your focus on passive candidates.\n\nThe recruiting process begins with a search for experienced people who aren't\nlooking to move. This is based on the notion that something may be wrong with\nanyone who wants to leave his or her current job. (Of the more than 20,000\ntalent professionals who responded to a LinkedIn survey in 2015, 86% said\ntheir recruiting organizations focused \"very much so\" or \"to some extent\" on\npassive candidates; I suspect that if anything, that number has since grown.)\nRecruiters know that the vast majority of people are open to moving at the\nright price: Surveys of employees find that only about 15% are _not_ open to\nmoving. As the economist Harold Demsetz said when asked by a competing\nuniversity if he was happy working where he was: \"Make me unhappy.\"\n\nFascinating evidence from the LinkedIn survey cited above shows that although\nself-identified \"passive\" job seekers are different from \"active\" job seekers,\nit's not in the way we might think. The number one factor that would encourage\nthe former to move is more money. For active candidates the top factor is\nbetter work and career opportunities. More active than passive job seekers\nreport that they are passionate about their work, engaged in improving their\nskills, and reasonably satisfied with their current jobs. They seem interested\nin moving because they are ambitious, not because they want higher pay.\n\nEmployers spend a vastly disproportionate amount of their budgets on\nrecruiters who chase passive candidates, but on average they fill only 11% of\ntheir positions with individually targeted people, according to research by\nGerry Crispin and Chris Hoyt, of CareerXroads. I know of no evidence that\npassive candidates become better employees, let alone that the process is\ncost-effective. If you focus on passive candidates, think carefully about what\nthat actually gets you. Better yet, check your data to find out.\n\n### Understand the limits of referrals.\n\nThe most popular channel for finding new hires is through employee referrals;\nup to 48% come from them, according to LinkedIn research. It seems like a\ncheap way to go, but does it produce better hires? Many employers think so.\nIt's hard to know whether that's true, however, given that they don't check.\nAnd research by Emilio Castilla and colleagues suggests otherwise: They find\nthat when referrals work out better than other hires, it's because their\nreferrers look after them and essentially onboard them. If a referrer leaves\nbefore the new hire begins, the latter's performance is no better than that of\nnonreferrals, which is why it makes sense to pay referral bonuses six months\nor so after the person is hired--if he or she is still there.\n\nA downside to referrals, of course, is that they can lead to a homogeneous\nworkforce, because the people we know tend to be like us. This matters greatly\nfor organizations interested in diversity, since recruiting is the only avenue\nallowed under U.S. law to increase diversity in a workforce. The Supreme Court\nhas ruled that demographic criteria cannot be used even to break ties among\ncandidates.\n\n### Measure the results.\n\nFew employers know which channel produces the best candidates at the lowest\ncost because they don't track the outcomes. Tata is an exception: It has long\ndone what I advocate. For college recruiting, for example, it calculates which\nschools send it employees who perform the best, stay the longest, and are paid\nthe lowest starting wage. Other employers should follow suit and monitor\nrecruiting channels and employees' performance to identify which sources\nproduce the best results.\n\n### Persuade fewer people to apply.\n\nThe hiring industry pays a great deal of attention to \"the funnel,\" whereby\nreaders of a company's job postings become applicants, are interviewed, and\nultimately are offered jobs. Contrary to the popular belief that the U.S. job\nmarket is extremely tight right now, most jobs still get lots of applicants.\nRecruiting and hiring consultants and vendors estimate that about 2% of\napplicants receive offers. Unfortunately, the main effort to improve hiring--\nvirtually always aimed at making it faster and cheaper--has been to shovel\nmore applicants into the funnel. Employers do that primarily through\nmarketing, trying to get out the word that they are great places to work.\nWhether doing this is a misguided way of trying to attract better hires or\njust meant to make the organization feel more desirable isn't clear.\n\n## The Grass Is Always Greener\u2026\n\nOrganizations are much more interested in external talent than in their own\nemployees to fill vacancies. Here are the top channels for quality hires.  \n![R1903B_SPOT_GRASS.png](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/04/R1903B_SPOT_GRASS.png)\n\nMuch better to go in the other direction: Create a smaller but better-\nqualified applicant pool to improve the yield. Here's why: Every applicant\ncosts you money--especially now, in a labor market where applicants have\nstarted to \"ghost\" employers, abandoning their applications midway through the\nprocess. Every application also exposes a company to legal risk, because the\ncompany has obligations to candidates (not to discriminate, for example) just\nas it does to employees. And collecting lots of applicants in a wide funnel\nmeans that a great many of them won't fit the job or the company, so employers\nhave to rely on the next step of the hiring process--selection--to weed them\nout. As we will see, employers aren't good at that.\n\nOnce people are candidates, they may not be completely honest about their\nskills or interests--because they want to be hired--and employers' ability to\nfind out the truth is limited. More than a generation ago the psychologist\nJohn Wanous proposed giving applicants a realistic preview of what the job is\nlike. That still makes sense as a way to head off those who would end up being\nunhappy in the job. It's not surprising that Google has found a way to do this\nwith gamification: Job seekers see what the work would be like by playing a\ngame version of it. Marriott has done the same, even for low-level employees.\nIts My Marriott Hotel game targets young people in developing countries who\nmay have had little experience in hotels to show them what it's like and to\nsteer them to the recruiting site if they score well on the game. The key for\nany company, though, is that the preview should make clear what is difficult\nand challenging about the work as well as why it's fun so that candidates who\ndon't fit won't apply.\n\nIt should be easy for candidates to learn about a company and a job, but\nmaking it really easy to apply, just to fill up that funnel, doesn't make much\nsense. During the dot-com boom Texas Instruments cleverly introduced a\npreemployment test that allowed applicants to see their scores before they\napplied. If their scores weren't high enough for the company to take their\napplications seriously, they tended not to proceed, and the company saved the\ncost of having to process their applications.\n\nIf the goal is to get better hires in a cost-effective manner, it's more\nimportant to scare away candidates who don't fit than to jam more candidates\ninto the recruiting funnel.\n\n### Test candidates' standard skills.\n\nHow to determine which candidates to hire--what predicts who will be a good\nemployee--has been rigorously studied at least since World War I. The\npersonnel psychologists who investigated this have learned much about\npredicting good hires that contemporary organizations have since forgotten,\nsuch as that neither college grades nor unstructured sequential interviews\n(hopping from office to office) are a good predictor, whereas past performance\nis.\n\nSince it can be difficult (if not impossible) to glean sufficient information\nabout an outside applicant's past performance, what other predictors are good?\nThere is remarkably little consensus even among experts. That's mainly because\na typical job can have so many tasks and aspects, and different factors\npredict success at different tasks.\n\nThere is general agreement, however, that testing to see whether individuals\nhave standard skills is about the best we can do. Can the candidate speak\nFrench? Can she do simple programming tasks? And so forth. But just doing the\ntests is not enough. The economists Mitchell Hoffman, Lisa B. Kahn, and\nDanielle Li found that even when companies conduct such tests, hiring managers\noften ignore them--and when they do, they get worse hires. The psychologist\nNathan Kuncel and colleagues discovered that even when hiring managers use\nobjective criteria and tests, applying their own weights and judgment to those\ncriteria leads them to pick worse candidates than if they had used a standard\nformula. Only 40% of employers, however, do any tests of skills or general\nabilities, including IQ. What are they doing instead? Seventy-four percent do\ndrug tests, including for marijuana use; even employers in states where\nrecreational use is now legal still seem to do so.\n\n### Be wary of vendors bearing high-tech gifts.\n\nInto the testing void has come a new group of entrepreneurs who either are\ndata scientists or have them in tow. They bring a fresh approach to the hiring\nprocess--but often with little understanding of how hiring actually works.\nJohn Sumser, of HRExaminer, an online newsletter that focuses on HR\ntechnology, estimates that on average, companies get five to seven pitches\n_every day_ --almost all of them about hiring--from vendors using data science\nto address HR issues. These vendors have all sorts of cool-sounding\nassessments, such as computer games that can be scored to predict who will be\na good hire. We don't know whether any of these actually lead to better hires,\nbecause few of them are validated against actual job performance. That aside,\nthese assessments have spawned a counterwave of vendors who help candidates\nlearn how to score well on them. Lloyds Bank, for example, developed a\nvirtual-reality-based assessment of candidate potential, and JobTestPrep\noffers to teach potential candidates how to do well on it. Especially for IT\nand technical jobs, cheating on skills tests and even video interviews (where\ncolleagues off camera give help) is such a concern that eTeki and other\nspecialized vendors help employers figure out who is cheating in real time.\n\n### Revamp your interviewing process.\n\nThe amount of time employers spend on interviews has almost doubled since\n2009, according to research from Glassdoor. How much of that increase\nrepresents delays in setting up those interviews is impossible to tell, but it\nprovides at least a partial explanation for why it takes longer to fill jobs\nnow. Interviews are arguably the most difficult technique to get right,\nbecause interviewers should stick to questions that predict good hires--mainly\nabout past behavior or performance that's relevant to the tasks of the job--\nand ask them consistently across candidates. Just winging it and asking\nwhatever comes to mind is next to useless.\n\nMore important, interviews are where biases most easily show up, because\ninterviewers do usually decide on the fly what to ask of whom and how to\ninterpret the answer. Everyone knows some executive who is absolutely certain\nhe knows the one question that will really predict good candidates (\"If you\nwere stranded on a desert island\u2026\"). The sociologist Lauren Rivera's\nexamination of interviews for elite positions, such as those in professional\nservices firms, indicates that hobbies, particularly those associated with the\nrich, feature prominently as a selection criterion.\n\nInterviews are most important for assessing \"fit with our culture,\" which is\nthe number one hiring criterion employers report using, according to research\nfrom the Rockefeller Foundation. It's also one of the squishiest attributes to\nmeasure, because few organizations have an accurate and consistent view of\ntheir own culture--and even if they do, understanding what attributes\nrepresent a good fit is not straightforward. For example, does the fact that\nan applicant belonged to a fraternity reflect experience working with others\nor elitism or bad attitudes toward women? Should it be completely irrelevant?\nLetting someone with no experience or training make such calls is a recipe for\nbad hires and, of course, discriminatory behavior. Think hard about whether\nyour interviewing protocols make any sense and resist the urge to bring even\nmore managers into the interview process.\n\n### Recognize the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning models.\n\nCulture fit is another area into which new vendors are swarming. Typically\nthey collect data from current employees, create a machine learning model to\npredict the attributes of the best ones, and then use that model to hire\ncandidates with the same attributes.\n\nAs with many other things in this new industry, that sounds good until you\nthink about it; then it becomes replete with problems. Given the best\nperformers of the past, the algorithm will almost certainly include _white_\nand _male_ as key variables. If it's restricted from using that category, it\nwill come up with attributes associated with being a white male, such as\nplaying rugby.\n\nInterviews are where biases most easily show up.\n\nMachine learning models do have the potential to find important but previously\nunconsidered relationships. Psychologists, who have dominated research on\nhiring, have been keen to study attributes relevant to their interests, such\nas personality, rather than asking the broader question \"What identifies a\npotential good hire?\" Their results gloss over the fact that they often have\nonly a trivial ability to predict who will be a good performer, particularly\nwhen many factors are involved. Machine learning, in contrast, can come up\nwith highly predictive factors. Research by Evolv, a workforce analytics\npioneer (now part of Cornerstone OnDemand), found that expected commuting\ndistance for the candidate predicted turnover very well. But that's not a\nquestion the psychological models thought to ask. (And even that question has\nproblems.)\n\nThe advice on selection is straightforward: Test for skills. Ask assessments\nvendors to show evidence that they can actually predict who the good employees\nwill be. Do fewer, more-consistent interviews.\n\n## The Way Forward\n\nIt's impossible to get better at hiring if you can't tell whether the\ncandidates you select become good employees. If you don't know where you're\ngoing, any road will take you there. You must have a way to measure which\nemployees are the best ones.\n\nWhy is that not getting through to companies? Surveyed employers say the main\nreason they don't examine whether their practices lead to better hires is that\nmeasuring employee performance is difficult. Surely this is a prime example of\nmaking the perfect the enemy of the good. Some aspects of performance are not\ndifficult to measure: Do employees quit? Are they absent? Virtually all\nemployers conduct performance appraisals. If you don't trust them, try\nsomething simpler. Ask supervisors, \"Do you regret hiring this individual?\nWould you hire him again?\"\n\nOrganizations that don't check to see how well their practices predict the\nquality of their hires are lacking in one of the most consequential aspects of\nmodern business.\n\n_**Editor 's Note:** A previous version of this article named three\nrecruitment process outsourcing companies, and stated that they utilized\nsubcontractors in India and the Philippines.

The newest development in hiring, which is both promising and\nworrying, is the rise of data science-driven algorithms to find and assess job\ncandidates. By my count, more than 100 vendors are creating and selling these\ntools to companies. Unfortunately, data science--which is still in its infancy\nwhen it comes to recruiting and hiring--is not yet the panacea employers hope\nfor.\n\nVendors of these new tools promise they will help reduce the role that social\nbias plays in hiring. And the algorithms can indeed help identify good job\ncandidates who would previously have been screened out for lack of a certain\neducation or social pedigree. But these tools may also identify and promote\nthe use of predictive variables that are (or should be) troubling.\n\nBecause most data scientists seem to know so little about the context of\nemployment, their tools are often worse than nothing. For instance, an\nastonishing percentage build their models by simply looking at attributes of\nthe \"best performers\" in workplaces and then identifying which job candidates\nhave the same attributes. They use anything that's easy to measure: facial\nexpressions, word choice, comments on social media, and so forth. But a\nfailure to check for any real difference between high-performing and low-\nperforming employees on these attributes limits their usefulness. Furthermore,\nscooping up data from social media or the websites people have visited also\nraises important questions about privacy. True, the information can be\naccessed legally; but the individuals who created the postings didn't intend\nor authorize them to be used for such purposes. Furthermore, is it fair that\nsomething you posted as an undergrad can end up driving your hiring algorithm\na generation later?\n\nAnother problem with machine learning approaches is that few employers collect\nthe large volumes of data--number of hires, performance appraisals, and so on\n--that the algorithms require to make accurate predictions. Although vendors\ncan theoretically overcome that hurdle by aggregating data from many\nemployers, they don't really know whether individual company contexts are so\ndistinct that predictions based on data from the many are inaccurate for the\none.\n\nYet another issue is that all analytic approaches to picking candidates are\nbackward looking, in the sense that they are based on outcomes that have\nalready happened. (Algorithms are especially reliant on past experiences in\npart because building them requires lots and lots of observations--many years'\nworth of job performance data even for a large employer.) As Amazon learned,\nthe past may be very different from the future you seek. It discovered that\nthe hiring algorithm it had been working on since 2014 gave lower scores to\nwomen--even to attributes associated with women, such as participating in\nwomen's studies programs--because historically the best performers in the\ncompany had disproportionately been men. So the algorithm looked for people\njust like them. Unable to fix that problem, the company stopped using the\nalgorithm in 2017. Nonetheless, many other companies are pressing ahead.\n\nThe underlying challenge for data scientists is that hiring is simply not like\ntrying to predict, say, when a ball bearing will fail--a question for which\nany predictive measure might do. Hiring is so consequential that it is\ngoverned not just by legal frameworks but by fundamental notions of fairness.\nThe fact that some criterion is associated with good job performance is\nnecessary but not sufficient for using it in hiring.\n\nTake a variable that data scientists have found to have predictive value:\ncommuting distance to the job. According to the data, people with longer\ncommutes suffer higher rates of attrition. However, commuting distance is\ngoverned by where you live--which is governed by housing prices, relates to\nincome, and also relates to race. Picking whom to hire on the basis of where\nthey live most likely has an adverse impact on protected groups such as racial\nminorities.\n\nUnless no other criterion predicts at least as well as the one being used--and\nthat is extremely difficult to determine in machine learning algorithms--\ncompanies violate the law if they use hiring criteria that have adverse\nimpacts. Even then, to stay on the right side of the law, they must show why\nthe criterion creates good performance. That might be possible in the case of\ncommuting time, but--at least for the moment--it is not for facial\nexpressions, social media postings, or other measures whose significance\ncompanies cannot demonstrate.\n\nIn the end, the drawback to using algorithms is that we're trying to use them\non the cheap: building them by looking only at best performers rather than all\nperformers, using only measures that are easy to gather, and relying on\nvendors' claims that the algorithms work elsewhere rather than observing the\nresults with our own employees. Not only is there no free lunch here, but you\nmight be better off skipping the cheap meal altogether.\n\n* * *\n\n[Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter+cappelli) is the George W.

As a consequence,\nhiring extraordinary talent is vital to our success and can never be taken for\ngranted. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we faced a challenge that\nwas, frankly, relatively new to our now 150-year-old firm. For decades\ninvestment banking had been one of the most sought-after, exciting, and fast-\ngrowing industries in the world. That made sense--we were growing by double\ndigits and had high returns, which meant that opportunity and reward were in\ngreat supply. However, the crash took some of the sheen off our industry; both\ngrowth and returns moderated. And simultaneously, the battle for talent\nintensified--within and outside our industry. Many of the candidates we were\npursuing were heading off to Silicon Valley, private equity, or start-ups.\nFurthermore, we were no longer principally looking for a specialized cadre of\naccounting, finance, and economics majors: New skills, especially coding, were\nin huge demand at Goldman Sachs--and pretty much everywhere else. The wind had\nshifted from our backs to our faces, and we needed to respond.\n\nRelated Video\n\n  * [__Save](/video/6026736199001)\n  * [__Share](/video/6026736199001)\n\nNot long ago the firm relied on a narrower set of factors for identifying \"the\nbest\" students, such as school, GPA, major, leadership roles, and relevant\nexperience--the classic resume topics. No longer. We decided to replace our\nhiring playbook with emerging best practices for assessment and recruitment,\nso we put together a task force of senior business leaders, PhDs in industrial\nand organizational psychology, data scientists, and experts in recruiting.\nSome people asked, \"Why overhaul a recruiting process that has proved so\nsuccessful?\" and \"Don't you already have many more qualified applicants than\navailable jobs?\" These were reasonable questions. But often staying successful\nis about learning and changing rather than sticking to the tried-and-true.\n\nEach year we hire up to 3,000 summer interns and nearly as many new analysts\ndirectly from campuses. In our eyes, these are the firm's future leaders, so\nit made sense to focus our initial reforms there. They involved two major\nadditions to our campus recruiting strategy--video interviews and structured\ninterviewing.\n\n### Asynchronous video interviews.\n\nTraditionally we had flown recruiters and business professionals to\nuniversities for first-round interviews. The schools would give us a set date\nand number of time slots to meet with students. That is most definitely not a\nscalable model. It restricted us to a smaller number of campuses and only as\nmany students as we could squeeze into a limited schedule. It also meant that\nwe tended to focus on top-ranked schools. How many qualified candidates were\nat a school became more important than who were the most talented students\nregardless of their school. However, we knew that candidates didn't have to\nattend Harvard, Princeton, or Oxford to excel at Goldman Sachs--our leadership\nranks were already rich with people from other schools. What's more, as we've\nbuilt offices in new cities and geographic locations, we've needed to recruit\nat more schools located in those areas. Video interviews allow us to do that.\n\nAt a time when companies were just beginning to experiment with digital\ninterviewing, we decided to use \"asynchronous\" video interviews--in which\ncandidates record their answers to interview questions--for all first-round\ninteractions with candidates. Our recruiters record standardized questions and\nsend them to students, who have three days to return videos of their answers.\nThis can be done on a computer or a mobile device. Our recruiters and business\nprofessionals review the videos to narrow the pool and then invite the\nselected applicants to a Goldman Sachs office for final-round, in-person\ninterviews. (To create the video platform, we partnered with a company and\nbuilt our own digital solution around its product.)\n\nThis approach has had a meaningful impact in two ways. First, with limited\neffort, we can now spend more time getting to know the people who apply for\njobs at Goldman Sachs. In 2015, the year before we rolled out this platform,\nwe interviewed fewer than 20% of all our campus applicants; in 2018 almost 40%\nof the students who applied to the firm participated in a first-round\ninterview. Second, we now encounter talent from places we previously didn't\nget to. In 2015 we interviewed students from 798 schools around the world,\ncompared with 1,268 for our most recent incoming class. In the United States,\nwhere the majority of our student hires historically came from \"target\nschools,\" the opposite is now true. The top of our recruiting funnel is wider,\nand the output is more diverse.\n\nBeing a people-driven business, we have worked hard to ensure that the video\ninterviews don't feel cold and impersonal. They are only one component of a\nbroader process that makes up the Goldman Sachs recruitment experience. We\nstill regularly send Goldman professionals to campuses to engage directly with\nstudents at informational sessions, \"coffee chats,\" and other recruiting\nevents. But now our goal is much more to share information than to assess\ncandidates, because we want people to understand the firm and what it offers\nbefore they tell us why they want an internship or a job.\n\nOur structured interview questions are designed to assess 10 core\ncompetencies.\n\nWe also want them to be as well prepared as possible for our interview\nprocess. Our goal is a level playing field. To help achieve it, we've created\ntip sheets and instructions on preparing for a video interview. Because the\nplatform doesn't allow videos to be edited once they've been recorded, we\noffer a practice question before the interview begins and a countdown before\nthe questions are asked. We also give students a formal channel for escalating\nissues should technical problems arise, though that rarely occurs.\n\nWe're confident that this approach has created a better experience for\nrecruits. It uses a medium they've grown up with (video), and most important,\nthey can do their interviews when they feel fresh and at a time that works\nwith their schedule. (Our data shows that they prefer Thursday or Sunday night\n--whereas our previous practice was to interview during working hours.) We\nsuspected that if the process was a turnoff for applicants, we would see a dip\nin the percentage who accepted our interviews and our offers. That hasn't\nhappened.\n\n### Structured questioning and assessments.\n\nHow can you create an assessment process that not only helps select top talent\nbut focuses on specific characteristics associated with success? Define it,\nstructure it, and don't deviate from it. Research shows that structured\ninterviews are effective at assessing candidates and helping predict job\nperformance. So we ask candidates about specific experiences they've had that\nare similar to situations they may face at Goldman Sachs (\"Tell me about a\ntime when you were working on a project with someone who was not completing\nhis or her tasks\") and pose hypothetical scenarios they might encounter in the\nfuture (\"In an elevator, you overhear confidential information about a\ncoworker who is also a friend. The friend approaches you and asks if you've\nheard anything negative about him recently. What do you do?\").\n\nEssentially, we are focused less on past achievements and more on\nunderstanding whether a candidate has qualities that will positively affect\nour firm and our culture. Our structured interview questions are designed to\nassess candidates on 10 core competencies, including analytical thinking and\nintegrity, which we know correlate with long-term success at the firm. They\nare evaluated on six competencies in the first round; if they progress,\nthey're assessed on the remaining four during in-person interviews.\n\nWe have a rotating library of questions for each competency, along with a\nrubric for interviewers that explains how to rate responses on a five-point\nscale from \"outstanding\" to \"poor.\" We also train our interviewers to conduct\nstructured interviews, provide them with prep materials immediately before\nthey interview a candidate, and run detailed calibration meetings using all\nthe candidate data we've gathered throughout the recruiting process to ensure\nthat certain interviewers aren't introducing grade inflation (or deflation).\nWe're experimenting with prehire assessment tests to be paired with these\ninterviews; we already offer a technical coding and math exam for applicants\nto our engineering organization.\n\nWe decided not to pilot these changes and instead rolled them out en masse,\nbecause we realized that buy-in would come from being able to show results\nquickly--and because we know that no process is perfect. Indeed, what I love\nmost about our new approach is that we've turned our recruiting department\ninto a laboratory for continuous learning and refinement. With more than\n50,000 candidate video recordings, we're now sitting on a treasure trove of\ndata that will help us conduct insightful analyses and answer questions\nnecessary to run our business: Are we measuring the right competencies? Should\nsome be weighted more heavily than others? What about the candidates'\nbackgrounds? Which interviewers are most effective? Does a top-ranked student\nat a state school create more value for us than an average student from the\nIvy League? We already have indications that students recruited from the new\nschools in our pool perform just as well as students from our traditional ones\n--and in some cases are more likely to stay longer at the firm.\n\nWhat's next for our recruiting efforts? We receive almost 500,000 applications\neach year. From this pool we hire approximately 3%. We believe that many of\nthe other 97% could be very successful at Goldman Sachs. As a result, picking\nthe right 3% is less about just the individual and increasingly about matching\nthe right person to the right role. That match may be made straight out of\ncollege or years later. We're experimenting with resume-reading algorithms\nthat will help candidates identify the business departments best suited to\ntheir skills and interests. We're looking at how virtual reality might help us\nbetter educate students about working in our offices and in our industry. And\nwe're evaluating various tools and tests to bring even more data into the\nhiring decision process. Can I imagine a future in which companies rely\nexclusively on machines and algorithms to rate resumes and interviews? Maybe,\nfor some. But I don't see us ever eliminating the human element at Goldman\nSachs; it's too deeply embedded in our culture, in the work we do, and in what\nwe believe drives success.\n\nI'm excited to see where this journey takes us. Our 2019 campus class is\nshaping up to be the most diverse ever--and it's composed entirely of people\nwho were selected through rigorous, objective assessments. There's no way we\naren't better off as a result.\n\n* * *\n\n[Dane E.

As Helen Keller once said, \u201cAlone we can do so little;\ntogether we can do so much.\u201d Because without the support and cooperation of\ninformation technology, HR simply can\u2019t deliver on the promise of digitally\ndriven, next-generation HR. Which is why we have identified five ways HR and\nIT must work together to make everyone\u2019s work life better.\n\nHere\u2019s what to do today to spark your HR/IT-led employee experience evolution.\n\n**One: Build and Structure New Work Teams**\n\nDesigning a successful workplace strategy requires a cultural shift in the\nrelationship between HR and IT\u2014and that shift demands new skills and talent,\nas well as structuring teams in a way that allows work and ideas to flow\nbetween groups. The result will be a more coordinated group capable of\ncreating experiences that positively impact an employee\u2019s perception of the\nworkplace.\n\nThis is why organizations are redesigning existing decentralized service\ndelivery models under a global experience function for HR, IT, payroll, and\nother people services. HR is similarly reinventing its structure with new\n\u201cexperience\u201d teams or even retitling functions, including \u201cpeople operations\u201d\nand \u201cHR service delivery.\u201d\n\n**Two: Make Technology Investments Together**\n\nAccording to Gartner, \u201cBy 2022, 75% of organizations will include employee\nexperience improvement as a performance objective for HR and IT groups.\u201d\nWhich means that HR and IT now have a growing priority to work together to\nensure new technologies not only address complex business issues but also meet\nthe expectations of people who use them.\n\nTo keep up, organizations are adding new global HR technology teams that\ninterface regularly with their IT counterparts so that together they can focus\non architecting the use and mobility of HR software, applications, and\nsystems.\n\n**Three: Optimize the Employee Experience On A Single Platform**\n\nEmployee-centric organizations are replacing websites and email with self-\nservice delivered via a single, digitally driven employee service center. By\ncreating these one-stop shops that address multiple employee needs, HR and IT\ncan work together to simplify the employee experience and remove the\ncomplexity that arises when dealing with multiple processes and systems.\n\nThis digital experience platform becomes the central touchpoint across the\nworkforce and enables departments such as HR and IT to deliver a consistent\nservice experience and retain their unique departmental requirements and\nworkflows.\n\n**Four: Design a Digital Experience That Inspires Connection And\nCollaboration**\n\nTransformation of the employee experience isn\u2019t just about automating tasks or\naddressing individual inquiries. It\u2019s about identifying and reimagining\nmoments in the employee journey that can have an overwhelmingly positive\u2014or\nequally negative\u2014impact on the end user.\n\nThere are several of these peak moments throughout the employee journey\u2014such\nas pre-boarding and onboarding, acclimation, and ongoing opportunities for\nlearning and feedback throughout an employee\u2019s career\u2014when HR and IT can\npartner to create experiences that inspire and foster a sense of belonging.\n\n**Five: Listen, Design, Test, And Iterate**\n\nIn attracting, retaining, and engaging the best talent, the pendulum is\nswinging away from what HR thinks employees want and toward what employees\nactually want. Companies seeking to put people at the center of their\norganization are introducing feedback channels to build trust and capture the\nvoice of the customer.

CEO Claire Schmidt tells\nTechCrunch that her company has just closed a $3 million seed round with\nfunding from Crosscut, Greycroft, Halogen Ventures, Vitalize VC and others.\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/SUMMIT_LA_2018_1104_131410_JP2_1801_ANDREW_JORGENSEN1.jpg?w=453)\n\nCEO Claire Schmidt\n\nSchmidt, most recently a VP at 20th Century Fox, started AllVoices after\nfinding inspiration in Susan Fowler's Uber blog post to create a platform that\nallowed employees at companies to anonymously offer feedback and file reports\nabout internal toxicity. Schmidt says existing processes used for reporting\ncan leave victims of harassment hesitant to come forward and fearful of the\nrisk of damaging their career paths.\n\n\"We're using this really outdated process, we're basically telling people,\n'Okay, just come in and tell someone in HR, and hope for the best,' \" Schmidt\ntold TechCrunch in an interview. \"And to me that seemed especially unfair to\nthe most vulnerable people in any given work environment because they're\njunior, they don't have as much job security -- they're viewed as more\nexpendable.\"\n\nEmployees at companies that use AllVoices can log into a mobile app and\nanonymously submit reports and receive text notifications when they've gotten\na response from the company, a streamlined process that Schmidt hopes can\nencourage people to \"report in real time.\" HR people don't see names or any\nother identifying information and AllVoices doesn't know the name of the\nemployee either, with all communications being encrypted.\n\n\"We do encrypt all of our data in storage, in backup, in transit, at rest --\nat every level,\" Schmidt says.\n\nSixty days after a complaint is made, AllVoices sends a notification to the\nemployee asking whether they were aware of any action being taken by the\ncompany and how satisfied they were with it. The startup then aggregates that\ndata and provides it back to the company so they can get a clearer sense of\ntheir own responsiveness.\n\nAllVoices isn't the only startup tackling this issue; in 2018 we\n[profiled](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/spot-launches-chatbot-for-hr-\ndepartments-to-address-harassment-and-discrimination/) Spot, which is also\nbuilding an anonymous reporting platform. AllVoices' platform goes beyond\nstreamlining processes for sexual harassment; the startup has modules for\ngeneral feedback, ethics and compliance issues, culture problems, diversity\nand inclusion concerns and harassment and bias complaints.\n\nThe startup has also aimed to make a free version of its product so that\nemployees at companies that haven't integrated AllVoices can still make\nanonymous complaints by entering in an email for someone in their HR\ndepartment. Schmidt hopes that the free service will serve their broader\nmission and help them onboard new customers.\n\nAllVoices says they now have nearly 50 companies using the platform, including\nInstacart, GoPro, Wieden+Kennedy, The Wing and FabFitFun.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "The Problems HR Tech Will (Hopefully) Solve in 2020 - Inc.", "link": "https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/the-problems-hr-tech-will-hopefully-solve-in-2020.html", "guid": "CAIiEBVTja5ViuUHuh50uF1umbIqFwgEKg8IACoHCAow8dTjAjCY4RswhaoM", "pubdate": "Wed, 13 Nov 2019 12:11:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/the-problems-hr-tech-will-hopefully-solve-in-2020.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Problems HR Tech Will (Hopefully) Solve in 2020</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Inc.</font>", "source": "Inc.", "body": "[![](//www.incimages.com/inc-logo-black.png)](/)\n\nThe Problems HR Tech Will (Hopefully) Solve in 2020\n\n#### [HR/Benefits](https://www.inc.com/benefits-hr)\n\n#\n\nThe Problems HR Tech Will (Hopefully) Solve in 2020\n\n## It's not just about building a cool app; it's about solving the people\nproblems of today and tomorrow\n\n[]()\n\n[]()\n\n[]()\n\n[![](https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/100x100/Suzanne_Lucas_headshot_355619.jpg)](/author/suzanne-\nlucas)[By Suzanne Lucas](/author/suzanne-lucas)Freelance\nwriter[@RealEvilHRLady](https://www.twitter.com/RealEvilHRLady)\n\n![](https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_151329072_2000133320009280145_406770.jpg)\n\nGetty Images\n\nTechnology has made our lives better. The fact that we have clean water,\nelectricity and I'm writing this while a robot vacuums my living room and\ntorments my cats means that my life is more comfortable and safe than my\nancestors' lives.\n\nBut, technology doesn't make everything better, and there are limits,\nespecially in the area of Human Resources. While HR Tech is always a hot topic\nof conversation in the Human Resources space and something businesses should\nbe focusing on.\n\nSo this year at [Unleash World in Paris](https://unleashgroup.io/), I spoke\nwith several HR Tech companies about the problems they are looking to solve.\nHere's what they said.\n\n **Problem:  **Employee satisfaction and turnover.\n\n **Solution from  **Klil Nevo, Managing Director of Customer Success at [Juno\nJourney](https://www.junojourney.com/):\n\nMillennials today are looking for personal development as well as career\nopportunities. We offer a tailor-made career map based on skills and tasks\nbacked with personalized learning that results in prediction for internal\nmobility and growth in your organization.\n\n **Problem:** Stress and Tension\n\n **Solution from  **Eric Woehrling: Finance Director Pacla Medical -With\n[BackHug](https://www.mybackhug.com/):\n\nPressure point massage. We install for free in offices, factories, and gyms--\nanywhere there are lots of people with tension and people book sessions on the\ndevice with our app just like an Uber, and they pay when they operate.\n\n **Problem:** The Talent Experience\n\n **Solution from  **Brad Goldoor: Chief People Office [Phenom\nPeople](https://www.phenompeople.com/):\n\nWe solve the talent experience problem by offering superior interfaces in user\ninterface and user experience. We take that data and reduce time and cost per\nhire and as well as increase quality.\n\n **Problem:  **Employee coaching\n\n **Solution from  **Ozlem Sarioglu, Co-Founder of\n[SparkUs](https://www.sparkus.com/):\n\nWe are about bringing coaching to more people. There are limited resources\nthat restrict coaching services to a few select people in an organization.\nWith SparkUs, we provide a self-directed coaching platform, creating a safe\nspace for people to think about themselves--reflect on what they are doing,\nexplore, and follow-through. Then the human element, like a coach, manager, or\nmentor, comes into play to fine-tune and deepen the experience.\"\n\n **Problem:  **Hiring Computer Engineers\n\n **Solution from:  **Aude Barral Cofounder\n[CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/start):\n\nThe tech market hiring market is very tense, and it's becoming increasingly\ndifficult for companies to find developers to hire. Here at Codingame, we\nprovide recruiters with an all in one tech recruiting platform to source,\nscreen, and retain the best developers And our main asset is that we do it\nthrough gamification. We provide gamified assessment tests that engage\ndevelopers in a different way and totally disrupt the way companies hire\nthem.:\n\n **Problem:  **Agility\n\n **Solution from  **Phillippe Pinault: CEO\n[holaSpirit](https://www.holaspirit.com/):\n\nThe problem is being agile at scale. When you grow a company, you like to grow\nand be still agile. Being agile when you are ten people is easy; being agile\nwhen you are 1000 is much more difficult. It meets new ways of management. We\nbring more clarity and transparency to who is doing what. We help distribute\nthe authority within the organization.\n\n **Problem:  **Email Flooding\n\n **Solution from  **Benoit Renoul: Head of Marketing\n[Talkspirit](https://www.talkspirit.com/):\n\nOur platform centralizes all the exchange of information and documents and\nprojects inside the company. New employees have instant access to all the\nprojects that they are involved in and don't need to exchange multiple emails\nwith all the existing employees. It allows them to access information\nthemselves without extensive training. There is a search engine that allows\nthem to access all the information they need.\n\n **Problem:  **Building an alumni network\n\n **Solution from  **Roman Vovk: Business Development Manager and Charlotte\nSault Head of International Marketing & Alumni Relations\n[IntraWorlds](https://www.intraworlds.com/):\n\nWe take a modern approach to the talent life cycle. We recognize that talent\nmanagement starts before, during, and after employment. We know that\nmillennials are moving jobs quicker than ever and no longer stay with firms\nfor decades. We help companies stay connected with former employees with a\ntalent-centric approach to help them reach their business objectives\n\n **Problem:  **Time consuming interviews\n\n **Solution from  **Adam Gretton Sales Manager, UK and Brian Morris Regional\nSales Manager Switzerland, [Sonru](https://www.sonru.com/):\n\nThe problem is it's too time-consuming, and companies have too many\ncandidates, and there is too much time spent scheduling interviews. These\ntelephone interviews are inconsistent. The name comes from the Irish to stand\nout, and we are designed to help candidates stand out by bringing their CV to\nlife. Cvs are not good predictors of job performance. The predictive validity\nof a telephone interview is .36 (36 percent of the time your decision based on\nthat was correct), and with a video interview, it's .51. Industry analysts\nfrom Gartner highlighted video interviewing as high current importance and\nhigh future relevance. So it will become a lot more mainstream.\n\nPublished on: Nov 13, 2019\n\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of\nInc.com.\n\nMore from Inc.\n\n![](https://grunerandjahr.112.2o7.net/b/ss/gjinccomprod/1/H.24.1--NS/0)\n![](https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6916907&c4=https://www.inc.com/)\n\n"}, {"item": "Best video conferencing software for business: Microsoft Teams plus eight more Zoom alternatives - ZDNet", "link": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-video-conferencing-software-and-services-for-business/", "guid": "CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnpkbmV0LmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2Jlc3QtdmlkZW8tY29uZmVyZW5jaW5nLXNvZnR3YXJlLWFuZC1zZXJ2aWNlcy1mb3ItYnVzaW5lc3Mv0gFkaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuemRuZXQuY29tL2dvb2dsZS1hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZS9iZXN0LXZpZGVvLWNvbmZlcmVuY2luZy1zb2Z0d2FyZS1hbmQtc2VydmljZXMtZm9yLWJ1c2luZXNzLw", "pubdate": "Thu, 02 Apr 2020 13:20:00 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-video-conferencing-software-and-services-for-business/\" target=\"_blank\">Best video conferencing software for business: Microsoft Teams plus eight more Zoom alternatives</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">ZDNet</font>", "source": "ZDNet", "body": "  * Edition: \n    * Asia \n    * Australia \n    * Europe \n    * India \n    * United Kingdom \n    * United States \n    * ZDNet around the globe:\n    * [ ZDNet China ](http://www.zdnet.com.cn/)\n    * [ ZDNet France ](http://www.zdnet.fr/)\n    * [ ZDNet Germany ](http://www.zdnet.de/)\n    * [ ZDNet Korea ](http://www.zdnet.co.kr/)\n    * [ ZDNet Japan ](http://japan.zdnet.com/)\n\n[ ](https://www.zdnet.com/ \"ZDNet\")\n\nSearch\n\nWhat are you looking for?

The meeting technology, powered by Dolby Voice, includes background\nnoise cancellation and integrates with hardware-based conference room systems\nas well as enterprise applications like Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Facebook\nWorkplace. A full array of whiteboard and screen sharing tools add\ncollaboration capabilities to any meeting. (For livestreams and large-scale\nweb-based presentations, you'll need a separate product called BlueJeans\nEvents.)\n\nAfter an initial free trial of the conferencing software, BlueJeans Meetings\nrequires one of three plans, which can be billed monthly or annually. The Me\nplan, designed for individuals and small businesses, costs $16.65 per meeting\nhost per month or $149.90 per year; it supports up to 50 attendees and doesn't\ninclude advanced features like cloud recording or integration with messaging\napps. The My Team plan, at $19.99 per host per month or $199.90 per year,\nsupports up to 75 attendees and includes 10 hours of cloud recordings per\nhost. A My Company plan, with unlimited cloud recordings and an assortment of\nenterprise-focused tools, supports up to 150 attendees and requires a custom\nquote.\n\nOh, and about the odd company name? It comes from the founders' desire to make\nvideo conferencing software \"as comfortable and casual as your pair of jeans.\"\n\n[ View Now at BlueJeans Meetings\n](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1100l9uA6/pubref:zdnet)\n\n## [Microsoft\nTeams](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=IokOf8qagZo&mid=24542&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fproducts.office.com%2Fmicrosoft-\nteams&fobs=zd-850731f207754a3aba9c099cb66efa97-dtp-as)\n\n[\n![teams.jpg](https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/02/03/60697de1-d1cc-4420-8055-0e26cadcbb1b/resize/1200xauto/4b6da0f62bb82da49de21cf0b06e2ead/teams.jpg)\n](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=IokOf8qagZo&mid=24542&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fproducts.office.com%2Fmicrosoft-\nteams&fobs=zd-850731f207754a3aba9c099cb66efa97-dtp-as)\n\nMicrosoft Teams, a successor to Skype for Business, isn't so much a product as\nit is a feature of Office 365, which tells you a lot about its design and who\nits features are best suited for.

Think of our list as a starting point to help you organize your\nsearch: One or more of the products that didn't make our cut might well\ndeserve to be on the shortlist for your business needs.\n\n  * **TechRepublic:**[ **How to deploy Microsoft Teams in your business**](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-deploy-microsoft-teams-in-your-business/)\n\nOur most important criteria was reputation. Every product on this list has a\nsolid track record in terms of performance and reliability. We were pleasantly\nsurprised, in fact, to find some firms in this business that have been going\nstrong for more than two decades.\n\nIn business terms, we know that our readers represent a broad swath of sizes,\nshapes, and cultures. So we went out of our way to find a mix of products that\nwork for cash-conscious small businesses (three of them are free, in fact, for\norganizations with three people or fewer). For slightly larger organizations,\nwe've tried to highlight commercial plans that are reasonably priced if you\ncan live with their limits, such as the number of meeting participants and the\nlength of each meeting.\n\nOthers offer high-end options ideal for large companies that want control over\nlivestreams and training sessions involving large audiences. The biggest\ndifferentiator here is the number of people you can have in the audience. That\nmakes sense for organizations that do webcasts and presentations to large\nnumbers of employees, customers, or members on a worldwide basis. Those plans\nare where you're much more likely to find support for advanced features like\nfull recording options and the ability to generate a PDF from the slide deck\nthat powered your online session.\n\nIf all you want is the ability to talk face to face, with the occasional bit\nof screen sharing and whiteboarding, you have plenty of choices. If you want\nto make those sessions available for replay online, you'll need to look\ncarefully at the cloud file storage options associated with each plan.\n\nAs you'll see from this list, you might already have access to effective tools\nbecause of subscriptions you're already paying for. We included four popular\nnames from that group: Microsoft Office 365, Google's GSuite, Intermedia's\nOffice in the Cloud, and Slack. Shops that have standardized on one of those\nplans might find that the included conferencing and communication features are\ngood enough to keep your company connected.\n\nFinally, we considered the sorts of features that reduce friction in using\nthis type of product. That list includes integration with other software you\ncurrently use, such as seamlessly connecting an online meeting to your\ncalendar and your organization's directory.

resources firm Ranstad, which recently became [global\nleader](https://www2.staffingindustry.com/site/Editorial/Daily-News/Randstad-\nand-Adecco-rank-first-and-second-on-SIA-s-2019-Largest-Global-Staffing-Firms-\nList-52014) in the sector, has chosen to further automate its workflow using a\nsmart contracts-focused blockchain.\n\nThe firm's 40,000 employees will be using an enterprise blockchain solution\nfrom New York-based Cypherium, which has struck partnerships with major cloud\nproviders Google Cloud Wing, IBM Cloud, and Amazon Web Services.\n\nAll of the paperwork-intensive processes involved in HR allocation, Randstad\n[revealed](https://cloud.google.com/customers/randstad/) on Feb. 28, will soon\nbe automated using the platform in conjunction with Google Cloud.\n\n## Automating verification\n\nCypherium has a hybrid design, combining two consensus mechanisms: Proof-of-\nWork (PoW) and HotStuff (also used for Facebook's Libra). This protocol, it\nclaims, is highly scalable yet also preserves both privacy and\ndecentralization. The platform [uses](https://cypherium.io/) a Turing-complete\nvirtual machine written in Java to run its smart contracts.\n\nRandstad expects that using the blockchain will greatly reduce human error and\nsave time, particularly when it comes to key bureaucratic tasks involved in HR\nwork -- payments, as well as verifying academic and professional\nqualifications and personal identity data.  \n\nVerifying this information will rely on cooperation with official sources,\nsuch as public authorities, who will need to publish hashes of digital\ncertificates onto the Cypherium public chain.\n\nTo safeguard individuals' privacy, Cypherium's approach will combine\ncryptographic hashing, metadata and a system of digital signatures that can\nremove the need to store the sensitive data itself. It also incorporates a\n[Decentralized Identifiers](https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-\nidentity-how-microsoft-and-others-plan-to-empower-users-to-own-and-control-\npersonal-data) standard to further protect users.\n\nIn a statement, Randstand's global collaboration manager, Frank van der Bijl,\nsaid that above all the firm wanted to find an easy solution:\n\n> \"Google Compute Engine and the Cypherium blockchain have proven the ideal\n> combination for us. Both can be accessed with a few clicks; there's no need\n> to worry about building everything ourselves, installing other apps, or\n> maintenance.\"\n\nLast fall, Big Four audit firm Deloitte\n[integrated](https://cointelegraph.com/news/deloitte-integrates-qedits-\nprivacy-tech-into-its-blockchain-platform) a privacy solution from\ncryptography startup QEDIT for its own blockchain platform, Eduscrypt, which\nis designed to enable organizations to track, share, and validate staff\nqualifications.\n\n  * [ #Blockchain News ](/tags/blockchain)\n  * [ #Google ](/tags/google)\n  * [

It would make sense that HR expertise is well represented among\nonline talent marketplaces. After all, HR is a key function around the world,\nand the difficulty of attracting and retaining top talent is certainly a\ncritical global challenge.\n\nBut, I wondered if the ubiquity of HR would moot the utility of online talent\nmarketplaces for both HR consultants and their potential clients. We know that\nonline talent marketplaces facilitate _talent discovery_ , the ability to\nidentify critical, non-local, expertise. But, local shouldn\u2019t be a problem for\nHR consultants, certainly not in the U.S. where there are over 43,000 HR\nconsulting businesses and revenues estimated at around $25 billion.\n\nHR support isn\u2019t just large and local, it is also mature. Unlike the tech\nworld, consultancies like [Mercer](https://www.mercer.com), [Willis Towers\nWatson, ](https://www.willistowerswatson.com)and [Aon\nHewitt](https://www.aonhewitt.com) have been around for many years.\nTraditional management consulting firms\n[i](https://www.willistowerswatson.com)ncreasingly see HR as an important\nfuture offering: [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com),\n[PwC](https://www.pwc.com), [EY](https://www.ey.com),\n[BCG](https://www.bcg.com) and even [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com) sees\nleadership, talent, and HR transformation as growth channels. Traditional\nexecutive recruiting firms have broadened their capabilities: firms like [Korn\nFerry](https://www.kornferry.com) offer well-resourced practices in talent\nmanagement and executive development. And, human capital consulting is\nobviously not limited to the U.S. The big international firms like [Egon\nZehnder](https://www.egonzehnder.com), [Wavestone](https://www.wavestone.com),\nand [Infosys](https://www.infosys.com) all operate globally.\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\nFinally, as a mature field, HR is a good example of how most freelance work is\nstill not contracted through online talent marketplaces but rather engaged\nthrough local relationships. For example, the HR guidance provided by business\nschool professors who \u201cside hustle\u201d as a consultant or corporate educator.\nMany, in turn, have create their own boutique consultancies.  \n\nWith these caveats in mind, I was pleased to recently speak with Emma El-\nKarout, the CEO and founder of [One Circle](https://www.onecirclehr.com/), a\nnew online talent platform in South Africa focused explicitly on HR\nconsultancy. It\u2019s a new startup, and it\u2019s interesting. And what I subsequently\nlearned from a number of other online talent marketplaces is that One Circle\nis on the right track: HR freelancing is a large and growing enterprise for\nplatforms.\n\nEmma arrived in Johannesburg South Africa by way of an HR career in Lebanon,\nQatar, and Dubai. As she put it, \u201cIt was impossible to ignore that HR played a\nkey role in each company, whether it was growing by double digits,\nreorganizing to establish more efficient shared services, implementing\ntechnology, or dealing with a down-sizing.\u201d\n\nIn building One Circle, Emma has focused on a strong international cohort of\nHR specialists, combining full-time freelancers and experts looking for side\ngigs. And, she has structured the community to focus on the life cycle of the\norganization and the employee\u2019s experience: HR strategy development,\norganization design, total rewards, talent management and leadership coaching.\nAs a new marketplace, she is still assembling the platform community. While\nthe majority of freelancers are South African, she is focused on building a\nservice that can operate on a pan-African and eventually a global scale.\n\nLearning about One Circle raised my interest in how HR consulting is doing in\n\u201cfull stack\u201d digital talent marketplaces. The answer is, very well. Here are\nsome examples:\n\nChandrika Pasricha, the CEO of [Flexing It](https://www.flexingit.com), the\nIndia and Asia based talent marketplace, mentioned that approximately 10% of\nthe freelancers on Flexing It, are HR or organization experts. She reports\nthat two thirds of the clients of their HR freelancers are large companies or\nhigh growth startups. Interestingly, an additional 20% of HR experts are hired\nby professional services firms to augment their teams with specific areas of\nexpertise required by their clients. She also notes that 50% of the HR project\nwork is delivered entirely remotely, or through a mix of onsite and remote\nwork. Pasricha forecasts strong continuing growth, particularly in these five\nareas:\n\n\u2022 HR planning and policy\n\n\u2022 Total rewards\n\n\u2022 Talent acquisition and recruitment\n\n\u2022 HR analytics\n\n\u2022 Employee and leadership development\n\nJody Greenstone Miller, CEO of the [Business Talent\nGroup](https://businesstalentgroup.com), a well-respected U.S. and European\nfreelance consultancy, describes a similar trend: the contribution of HR\nexperts in her markets freelancing as large and growing.  She notes, \u201cAs\nstewards of talent strategy, HR leaders see the way the workforce is changing.\nThey also see the impact that high-end independent talent makes in other areas\nof the business. So it's no surprise that they would turn to this powerful\nresource when tackling their own top priorities.\u201d She also points out that\n\u201cThe majority of projects we serve are still largely a mix of onsite and\nremote, and HR is no exception. Remote-only projects make up just 16% of this\nwork.\u201d And, as Miller observes, among the 3,000 HR freelancers working with\nBTG, the expertise in greatest demand was similar in some respects to Flexing\nIt, but differed in other areas:\n\n\u00b7     Organizational design\n\n\u00b7     Project management\n\n\u00b7     Communications\n\n\u00b7     HR and culture transformation; change management\n\n\u00b7     Leadership development; recruiting and talent strategy\n\nI also talked with Hamish Grant, VP of marketing at\n[Expert360](https://www.expert360.com), a talent marketplace for highly\nskilled independent professionals based in Australia.  He points out that 12%\nof their 25,000 plus independent consultants are HR experts. Grant describes\nthe business this way, \u201cThe majority of our HR demand comes from clients\nplanning digital and agile workforce transformations. This impacts traditional\nworkforce structures, so our HR consultants are being offered a great deal of\nwork.\u201d In Expert360\u2019s case, most of this work is done on site vs remotely.\nGrant sees growth at double digits in a wide range of HR project areas, but\ndescribes the following five areas topping demand:\n\n\u00b7     Change management\n\n\u00b7     Talent strategy\n\n\u00b7     Organizational design and restructuring\n\n\u00b7     HR planning\n\n\u00b7     HR policy and process development\n\nA final conversation was with [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com), the Israel\nbased global talent marketplace. Fiverr\u2019s analysts shared that the marketplace\nalmost doubled the number of HR experts on their site within the past year.\nThey also reported that orders for HR services more than tripled in the same\nperiod as did earnings for HR services. Gali Arnon, CMO of Fiverr described\nthe trend this way, \u201cWe\u2019re finding that that more and more people in the HR\nfield are freelancing, or using the platform as a side hustle. Clearly, the\ndemand for HR services is increasing and the amount of money people are\nwilling to spend is also increasing.\u201d\n\n**The takeaway** : although HR is a mature profession with a well-established\necosystem, and many local alternatives, it certainly looks as though a new\ndoorway to HR expertise is opening and very welcome. With large and continuing\ngrowth in startups, new technologies that torque HR effectiveness, and big\ncorporates driving transformation, HR service needs are growing, and the\nfreelance revolution is on the job.\n\nViva la revolution!\n\nFollow me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jon-younger-phd-57a41455/).\n\n[![Jon\nYounger](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/57c369abfeca92d6e1be416954cf7234?s=400&d=mm&r=g)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonyounger/\n\"Photo of Jon Younger\")\n\n[Jon Younger](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonyounger/)\n\nHR thought leader, author, teacher and early stage investor.

They have physical watch hands that work on top of an\ne-paper screen that\u2019s so low-power that the watch can last for a couple of\nweeks on a charge. You get the benefit of a traditional watch without a\nglowing screen and the ability to get useful information and notifications.\n\nFossil\u2019s new Hybrid HR platform has all of the right ideas, but few of them\nfeel finished. Depending on your needs, that might not be a huge problem for\nyou, but there is no question that there is a lot of unfulfilled potential\ninside these watches.\n\nIf you love the way they look, they do cover the basics \u2014 starting at $195.\nWith much more advanced competition from Samsung and Apple available at around\nthe same price points, looks are the main reason to consider Fossil\u2019s new\nhybrid watches now.\n\n##  Our review of  [Fossil Hybrid Smartwatch HR](/products/hybrid-smartwatch-\nhr/9232)\n\nVerge Score 6 out of 10\n\n![](https://cdn0.vox-\ncdn.com/hermano/verge/product/image/9232/akrales_191113_3785_0016.jpg)\n\n### Good Stuff\n\n  * Long battery life\n  * Does more than other hybrids\n  * Good looks\n\n### Bad Stuff\n\n  * Clunky software\n  * Limited notification options\n  * Competitive watches do much more\n\n[Buy for $195.00 from Fossil](https://fave.co/2q4k7nZ) [Buy for $195.00 from\nAmazon](https://amzn.to/32IPC3X)\n\nThe model I am reviewing is the \u201cHybrid Smartwatch HR Collider Dark Brown\nLeather.\u201d But in true Fossil fashion, there are several nearly identical\nmodels with [slight variations in\nstyle](https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fossil.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fwearable-\ntechnology%2Fsmartwatches%2Fhybrid-hr-\nsmartwatches.html&referrer=theverge.com&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2019%2F11%2F23%2F20977918%2Ffossil-\nhybrid-hr-smartwatch-collider-review-battery-software-specs-price). It is a\nheavy, chunky watch: 13mm thick and 42mm in diameter. The watch straps are\neasily replaceable, but the leather version that comes with this one is quite\nnice.\n\nIt is to me, anyway: this watch matches my aesthetic preferences, and I would\nbe happy to wear it every day, but I also don\u2019t have a problem with large\nwatches. If you have smaller wrists, these watches will feel awfully big on\nyou.\n\nThe watchface is a small, circular e-paper screen surrounded by a ring with\nhour indicators. The two watch hands sit above it. It all feels well-\nintegrated and watch-like, though I do think the screen feels cramped,\nespecially when you are trying to read a notification on it.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/ezZhxIEWCqIRsuqnshzEH02_pvw=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19376508/akrales_191113_3785_0016.jpg)\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/Wo5_6XF_nfSFIfbDBqGFxmNuj7Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19376506/akrales_191113_3785_0004.jpg)\n\nThe core of the Hybrid HR software on the watch is a simple, somewhat\ncustomizable watchface with four spots for complications. Your options for\nwhat information goes into those spots are somewhat limited: there\u2019s weather,\nsome fitness options, and the date. That\u2019s really about it.\n\nIt\u2019s not backlit, either. To see the time in the dark, you just double-tap the\nwatch, and it will be lit up with four tiny LEDs \u2014 much like a traditional LCD\nwatch from the \u201880s. It looks sort of cheap, but it\u2019s weirdly nostalgic!\n\n# Agree to Continue: Fossil Hybrid HR\n\n_Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and\nconditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s\nimpossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements.\nBut we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use\ndevices when we review them, since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read\nand definitely can\u2019t negotiate._\n\nTo start using the Fossil Hybrid HR you will need to set up a Fossil account.\nWhen you do, you must agree to:\n\n  * Fossil\u2019s terms of use\n  * Fossil\u2019s privacy policy\n  * You must also provide a date of birth (you could probably lie, though)\n\nYou can optionally also:\n\n  * Provide \u201cdata usage to improve your experience\u201d\n\nFinal tally: two mandatory agreements, one mandatory piece of potentially\nsensitive information, and one optional agreement.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen smartwatches with physical hands before, and one of the problems is\nthat those hands occlude the information on the watchface. That obviously\nhappens on the home screen here quite a bit. The Fossil Hybrid HR system\u2019s\nsolution is that you can flick your wrist, and the hands will do a little spin\naround for a second or two, letting you see what\u2019s underneath them.\n\nYou can also customize the buttons to bring you into a few specific sections\nof the Hybrid HR system. I hesitate to call these functions \u201capps,\u201d but\nthere\u2019s not a better word for it. Here\u2019s what you can do:\n\n  * Workout mode\n  * Wellness dashboard\n  * Stopwatch\n  * Timer\n  * Past Notifications\n  * Music control\n  * Weather\n\nYou can customize different button configurations and watchfaces in the\nsmartphone app, so you could theoretically switch between a workout mode and a\nwork mode. In practice, tucking into Fossil\u2019s smartphone app is enough of a\nhassle that you won\u2019t bother.\n\nWhen you click into one of these apps, the watch hands move to point to 9 and\n3, so they\u2019re horizontal, and then the information displays above and below\nthem. It works, but it\u2019s awkward. Worse: it means that very little information\ncan fit on the screen at any given time. That would be okay if you could\nquickly scroll, but the refresh rate on this screen is slow enough to be\nannoying.\n\n\"The Fossil smartphone app won\u2019t let you get notifications from all of your\napps\"\n\nYou\u2019ll likely find yourself tapping a button to scroll and either waiting in\nannoyance or \u2014 more annoying and more commonly \u2014 hitting it twice because you\nthought maybe the first press didn\u2019t take and it\u2019ll scroll too far.\n\nThe Hybrid HR system has better fitness tracking than I expected, with stats\nfor steps, workout times, calories burned, and heart rate. You can sync it to\nUnder Armour or Google Fit but not Fitbit. If you\u2019re mostly interested in\nfitness, a Fitbit or an Apple Watch is a better bet.\n\nThe Hybrid HR can show you notifications, but mysteriously, it can only do so\nfor a just over a dozen hand-picked apps, though a few more are [reportedly on\nthe way](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/19/fossil-hybrid-hr-review-\nthis-hybrid-smartwatch-is-off-to-a-rough-start/). So while I can get notified\nabout calendar alerts and Facebook likes, I can\u2019t get alerted for Slack\nmessages or Signal texts.\n\nI\u2019d expect that limitation on iOS, but it\u2019s baffling that it also exists when\nyou use the watch with an Android phone. [Fossil _already makes_ hybrid\nsmartwatches](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16623836/fossil-q-activist-\nhybrid-smartwatch-review) that can receive alerts from any arbitrary app.\n\nYou cannot reply to notifications, of course, as there isn\u2019t a microphone or a\ntouchscreen, nor is there a speaker; all of the alerts are vibrations on your\nwrist. It does have an alarm system if you are the sort of person who wears a\nwatch to sleep.\n\n![](https://cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/thumbor/npRMSuGiz38b5bhh3gaymagWvfk=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x0/filters:focal\\(0x0:2040x1360\\):no_upscale\\(\\)/cdn.vox-\ncdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19376507/akrales_191113_3785_0014.jpg)\n\nDespite all of the complaints above, I do still kind of dig this watch. I like\nthe way it looks, I like that it has a battery that lasts nearly two weeks\n(mine died after 10 days), and I like that it does the majority of things I\nwant from a smartwatch. I just wish it did them a little better, even within\nthe limitations imposed by this screen.\n\nThe real question is why would you impose those limitations. We\u2019ve seen\nsimilar screens on smartwatches do much more \u2014 on the Pebble smartwatches.\nEven setting that aside, the Apple Watch Series 3 costs the same and does\ninfinitely more. Similarly, you can find a Samsung Galaxy Active smartwatch\nfor around the same price if you\u2019re an Android user.\n\nCharging a smartwatch every day is annoying, but for me, it\u2019s less annoying\nthan dealing with the limitations of the Hybrid HR. If the price came down or\nif the software got better, that calculation might change. Until then, unless\nyou really love the way this watch looks, consider something else.\n\n_Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

If so, remember that half a million\nCanadians stay home from work every week on account of poor mental health.\n\nAre managers noticing that employees seem a bit withdrawn or down? Know that\n2/3 of people who suffer from mental health stay silent about their struggles.\n\nFortunately, prioritizing workplace mental health is more common than ever\nbefore as employers become more aware that a healthy workforce is more likely\nto be a happy, engaged and productive one. It's also incredibly expensive to\nkeep mental health in the office shadows: mental health-related disengagement\n(in the forms of absenteeism and presenteeism) costs Canadian employers more\nthan $6 billion annually, and mental illness is the leading cause of\ndisability claims nationwide.\n\nIt's true that Employee Assistance Programs are high priority for most Human\nResource leaders these days, but it is important to note that they are still\nseverely underused. A 2019 survey by the International Foundation of Employee\nBenefit Plans revealed that while 84% of employers offer EAPs, three-quarters\nsaid that a mere 10% or less of their employees actually used them.\n\nUltimately, barriers like inconvenience, difficulty finding providers or\ngetting appointments, figuring out the reimbursement process and lingering\nstigmas are still getting in the way for many employees.\n\nIn light of this, here are five ways HR professionals can increase access to\n-- and encourage employee engagement with -- mental health resources this\nyear:\n\n**1) Take some time to review how employees  can access EAPs and/or their\nbenefits.** Is it cumbersome? What obstacles can you remove? Create some\nsimple communication tools -- think checklists, infographics, short videos --\nto make it easier for employees to navigate this process. Make sure they know\nwhat amounts they can claim and what paperwork is needed.  \nOffering virtual care as a complement to EAP is another way to increase\nemployees' access to mental health support. Connecting with registered mental\nhealth specialists on a platform like [Akira](mailto:akirahealth.ca) is a way\nto bring down barriers often associated with accessing mental health support:\ntext and video messaging at any time of day or night is a much more accessible\nway to initiate a difficult conversation.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n**2) Create your own toolkit for when employees approach you with mental\nhealth struggles.** It's not easy to come forward when you're struggling, so\nmake sure you're ready to handle the conversation optimally. Listen, empathize\nand validate concerns. Offer all available options for mental health support\n(ie: More flex time? Adjusted hours? Working from home on certain days?). Most\nimportantly, remember to treat mental health difficulties as you would a\nphysical health concern.\n\n**3) Turn inward and address your own mental wellness.** It can be difficult\nin any industry to practice what we preach, especially in positions where\nwe're responsible for the wellbeing of many others. But don't lose sight of\nyour own mental wellness. Taking your own mental health pulse and making use\nof the supports that are available to your employees will not only ensure\nyou're in a position to do your best work, but will give you valuable\nfirsthand experience with the resources available in your company.\n\n**4) Use your influence to create a supportive workplace culture.** It may\nseem obvious because HR pros spend much of their working days thinking about\nemployee culture, but you'll make an even greater impact if you're also a\nwellness leader when you're away from your desk. Do you love spinning in your\nspare time? Champion a company-funded spinning club! Are you trying to learn\nto meditate at home? Don't be shy to share that in the lunch room! Try to use\nyour influence to reduce mental health stigma and encourage positive habits at\nevery opportunity.\n\nUltimately, remember that prioritizing mental health has countless benefits --\nnot just protecting the bottom line or retaining great people. A recent study\nby Morneau found that 77% of employees would actually consider changing jobs\nfor an employer who offers more mental health and wellbeing support. It's\nworth keeping your finger on this pulse.\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily newsletters\nfrom HRD Asia.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n### Recent articles & video\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637218764030398689.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-\nbreaker-mom-advises-against-prolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: MOM advises against 'prolonged' no-pay\nleave](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-breaker-mom-advises-against-\nprolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218756963772601.jpg)](/asia/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219166)\n\n#### [How has COVID-19 impacted managers and\nemployees?](/asia/news/general/how-has-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-\nemployees/219166)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218753186012580.jpg)](/asia/news/general/ceo-\nof-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-from-a-challenge/219160)\n\n#### [CEO of HP Canada: 'I was never one to shy away from a\nchallenge'](/asia/news/general/ceo-of-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-\nfrom-a-challenge/219160)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217706478717086.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/change-\nmanagement/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-support-employees/219005)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: How can HR support\nemployees?](/asia/specialisation/change-management/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-\nsupport-employees/219005)\n\n### Most Read Articles\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n06 Apr 2020\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n__\n\n  * [HRT](https://www.hrtechnologynews.com/)\n  * [Companies](/asia/companies)\n  * [People](/asia/people)\n  * [Newsletter](/asia/newsletter)\n\n  * [About us](/asia/about-us)\n  * [Authors](/asia/authors)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/asia/privacy-policy)\n  * [Conditions of use](/asia/conditions-of-use)\n  * [Contact us](/asia/contact-us)\n  * [RSS __](/asia/rss)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/HumanResourcesDirectorAsia/)[__](https://twitter.com/HRD_Asia)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/human-\nresources-director-asia)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Key Media ![](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n"}, {"item": "Top Tips for Creating a Recruitment Video In-House - HR Technologist", "link": "https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-tips-for-creating-a-recruitment-video-inhouse/", "guid": "CAIiEM_BuOvIOe_rWFuA8PxD71IqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowuaD7CjD8y_MCMMr1oQY", "pubdate": "Tue, 03 Dec 2019 13:59:17 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-tips-for-creating-a-recruitment-video-inhouse/\" target=\"_blank\">Top Tips for Creating a Recruitment Video In-House</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">HR Technologist</font>", "source": "HR Technologist", "body": "![](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/images/loaderimage.gif)\n\n  * Skip to Main Navigation\n  * Skip to Main Content\n  * Skip to Footer\n\n[![](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/images/logo.png?20170407)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com \"HR Technologist\")\n\n  * [ Articles](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/ \"Articles\")\n  * [ Interviews](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/ \"Interviews\")\n  * [ News](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/ \"News\")\n  * [ Resources](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/whitepapers/ \"Resources\")\n  * [ Webinars](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/webinar/ \"Webinars\")\n\n  * Follow Us \n\nFollow Us\n\n[ __](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist \"Follow Us on Facebook\") [\n__](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist \"Follow Us on Twitter\") [\n__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-technologist \"Follow Us on LinkedIn\")\n[ __](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/feed/ \"Subscribe to RSS Feed\")\n\n  * [ __](javascript:void\\(0\\);

But with the right know-how, you can learn how to create\nan awesome video to attract top talent with very little budget.\n\nBelow are my tips on how.\n\n## **Determining what equipment you will use**\n\nFirst off, you need to determine what tools you have at your disposal. The two\nmain considerations for filming are - camera and sound.\n\n**Camera** \\- if you have any budget at all, I recommend hiring a local\nvideographer to come and shoot for a few hours. Hiring videographers is an\ninteresting one. While they are all looking to get that $2,000 a day high-end\ngig if you haggle you can get a great local camera guy to come in for a few\nhours for a few hundred dollars. There are various best places to try and find\nlocal camera people. If you post a job, you should quickly get dozens of bids\nand you can choose the best one at the best price. Make sure you check their\nreel before you hire them. Ability can vary dramatically among camera folk.\n\nHowever, if you are working on little or no budget then you wouldn\u2019t be the\nfirst person to use the camera on your phone. Just use it in landscape mode\nand with good lighting, you can create something decent.\n\n**Sound -** a crucial factor to consider is audio. If you are doing the\nfilming yourself, then a quick trick is to strategically place an additional\nsmartphone in Voice Memo Recording Mode near whoever is being interviewed so\nyou have two sources of audio. Good audio is essential. If your candidates\ncan\u2019t hear the person speaking or you hear a lot of background noises, it\nmakes your production seem very unprofessional.\n\n## **Prepping for your shoot**\n\nNow you have figured out what equipment you need to use, next up is planning\nyour shoot.\n\n### **Script**\n\n  \nFirst off you need to figure out what you want to say in the video and how you\nare going to say it.\n\nWrite down the key points you want to get across e.g. size of the company,\ncompany history, growth, what you do, what it\u2019s like working there, why people\nwould want to join, etc. Then you need to plan how you will get it across.\n\nThe different ways that people give information on videos are via:\n\n**Interviews** \\- this is when you interview someone and get them to say\nexactly what you want them to say e.g. what it\u2019s like working there, why\npeople should join. Given you are doing a recruitment video, potential talent\nwill want to see other employees and the CEO to get a sense of the company.\n\nFor your interviews, you ideally want to interview several people so when you\nare editing you have lots of great soundbites to choose from. If you watch a\ndocumentary they rarely have anyone speak for more than 15 seconds at a time.\nYou also need to determine who to interview. The CEO? Senior Management? The\nHR team? Also, consider current employees who are more enigmatic and could be\ngood on camera. Not everyone loves being in front of the camera.\n\nAlso, remember you need to get anyone who is on camera to sign a model release\nform. There are plenty of free templates on the internet but they are legally\nrequired by you to do before you show anyone on a public video. Ever notice\nblurred out people on TV? They didn\u2019t give their consent to be shown on film,\nso the producers needed to blur them out.\n\n**Voice Over** \\- filmmakers use voice overs to get across information that\ndoesn\u2019t necessarily work as well delivered in interviews. Things like where\nyou are based, how many employees you have, what products you have - for this\nyou would need to plan what shots you want to take to show when the voice over\nis playing e.g. Exterior of building, close up of the company logo hanging on\nthe wall, video footage of your employees working away or having downtime,\ninterior of the office. You also need to consider planning to take footage of\nwhat you actually make - if it is a physical good - can you take video of the\nfactory or of the final product? If you make a digital good can you use\nsomething like Quicktime to capture video of your solution on your computer,\nwhich you then integrate into your video?\n\n**Text on screen** \\- another way to convey information is via text on the\nscreen. This is done in the editing process but it is always a good idea to\nplan ahead what information you want to convey and how you will do it e.g.\ninterviews, voice-over via text on the screen.\n\n### **Locations**\n\n  \nNext up, you need to determine the best locations to do your sit down\ninterviews. You will need somewhere quiet with good lighting that has an\ninteresting background. You will never want to shoot anyone against a window\nor against a white wall. White walls look awful on camera and make the people\nyou are interviewing look terrible too as they drain all the color from their\nfaces. If you pay attention to any TV show or movie you will notice they\nrarely have white walls. Can you film them at their desk? (if everyone can be\nquiet) or the board room? You also never want to interview someone right next\nto a wall, you want them sitting a few feet away from the wall.\n\n## **Lights, camera, action!**\n\nSo now you have your equipment, your locations and who you are going to\ninterview, it\u2019s time for action.\n\nBefore you start filming, take a few test shots and have a look at how\neverything looks on camera. Pay particular attention to the lighting. Is it\ntoo dark or too harsh? Turn off lights or close curtains if the lighting is\ntoo harsh - use some lamps and play around with their placement until you get\nthe best lighting. And don\u2019t forget to place some sort of sound recorder e.g.\nSmart Phone Voice Memo recorder strategically close to the candidate, but not\nso obvious on camera.\n\nYou will want your interview questions lined up and you will want to prep your\ninterviewees to respond with the question in their intro sentence e.g.\n\nYou ask: What is your favorite thing about working here?\n\nInterviewee: My favorite thing about working here\u2026\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to do a few takes to get the best answers. Remember you can\nalways edit out mistakes etc. in the editing process.\n\n## **Editing**\n\nSo now you have all the footage you want - interviews, shots of the office,\nproducts, exterior of the building, people having fun, etc. It\u2019s time to edit\nit all together. Ideally, you want to keep your video under two minutes and\nadd some music and graphics to make it more compelling.\n\nEditing used to be super technical and just for the pros but now as people\u2019s\ncomputer skills have increased and with editing software advances - nearly\nanyone can create really slick looking editing content themselves. Today there\nare many [templates](https://clipchamp.com/en/products/create) you can use so\nyou just upload your content and it works with you to create suitable content.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Create a Great Branded Recruitment\nVideo](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-to-\ncreate-a-great-branded-recruitment-video/)**\n\nYou will want an intro e.g. exterior shots, company logo, voice-overs about\nyour company, then the middle part usually contains the interviews. While they\nare talking you can cut away to show what they are talking about eg. if they\nare saying it\u2019s a really fun work environment, cut to a shot of people\nworking. Don\u2019t forget at the end to leave a call to action e.g. website, HR\ncontact details, links to social media, etc.When you are going through your\ninterview footage, cut them down so you only get the best sound bites. You can\ncombine all the best responses together e.g. what\u2019s my favorite thing about\nworking here can go into one bucket so you can see who gave the best responses\nand soundbites that you potentially want to include.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it! I hope this has been helpful in giving you the confidence to\nlearn how to create an awesome recruitment video yourself with little or no\nresources.\n\n**Learn More:[Is Your Recruiting Culture Inadvertently Biased Against\nWomen?](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/do-you-\nhave-a-biased-recruiting-culture/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-tips-for-creating-a-recruitment-video-\ninhouse%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Top+Tips+for+Creating+a+Recruitment+Video+In-\nHouse \"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Top+Tips+for+Creating+a+Recruitment+Video+In-\nHouse&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-tips-for-creating-a-recruitment-video-\ninhouse%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-tips-for-creating-a-recruitment-video-\ninhouse%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-tips-for-creating-a-recruitment-video-\ninhouse%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Top Tips for Creating a Recruitment Video\nIn-House&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-tips-for-creating-a-recruitment-video-\ninhouse%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

The round was led by [Insight\nPartners,](https://www.insightpartners.com/) and included participation from\nexisting investors Accel, FirstMark, SignalFire, and Shasta Ventures.\n\nItai Tsiddon, co-founder of Lightricks -- another company looking to modernize\nmedia creation, most recently with the[ launch of content creation apps for\nsmall businesses](https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/facetune-maker-lightricks-\nexpands-with-a-trio-of-apps-for-small-businesses/) -- is joining Frame.io's\nboard to represent Insight Partners. To date, [Frame.io\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/frame-io) has raised $82.2 million.\n\nFounded in 2014 by the owner of a post-production company Emery Wells and\ntechnologist John Traver, Frame.io was created to solve the workflows\nchallenges filmmakers faced in their daily lives.\n\nToday, the Frame.io platform helps creative professionals streamline the video\ncreation process by centralizing media assets, including dailies, scripts,\nstoryboards, work-in-progress, and more, while also allowing for frame-\naccurate feedback and comments, annotations, and real-time approvals. The\ncompany additionally touts faster upload speeds than other cloud hosting\nservices, like Vimeo, Box, Dropbox, and others.\n\nThe Frame.io web platform was designed to be a part of its customer's existing\nprocesses, by integrating with non-linear editing systems (NLE's), like Adobe\nPremiere Pro, Avid, Apple Final Cut Pro, and DaVinci Resolve Studio. These\nintegrations allow editors to upload directly to Frame.io, then organize and\nshare their products both internally and with external clients.\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Apple-Design-Winning-\nFrame.io-iOS-App.png?w=680)\n\nThe service today is priced starting at $19 per month for an individual\ncreator, $49 for a small team of three people, with the option to add on seats\nat $25/per seat per month, for up to 25 total seats. Beyond that, custom\nenterprise pricing is available. The feature set, active and archival storage,\nand customer support also improves as you move further up the pricing tiers.\n\nSince launch, Frame.io has been adopted by a number of larger customers,\nincluding Turner Broadcasting, Disney, NASA, Snapchat, BBC, BuzzFeed, TED,\nAdobe, Udemy, Google, Fox Sports, Media Monks, Ogilvy, and VICE Media. Of its\n1 million active customers, Wells tells TechCrunch around 17,000 are from\npaying accounts. He declined to speak to Frame.io's profitability or current\nvaluation, however.\n\nFrame.io claims its customer base is 60% more efficient after adopting its\nsolution, 41% more likely to hit their project deadlines, and are able to\nproduce 39% more videos per month, on average.\n\nWith the added capital, the startup plans to double its product, design, and\nengineering teams from 40 people to 80, growing its total team from 110 to\n240. It will also open an L.A.-based office and showroom next year, invest\nfurther in security, develop a set of (still to be announced) new products,\nand deliver on its so-called \"camera to cloud\" initiative.\n\nThis initiative was [announced](https://blog.frame.io/2019/10/09/michael-\ncioni/) in October alongside the appointment of Michael Cioni, previously of\nPanavision, to Frame.io Global SVP of Innovation. Cioni is known in the\nindustry for creating creative services company Light Iron in 2009 and\nspearheading the Millennium DXL 8K large-format camera system at Panavision.\nHe's also [known for his work](https://www.provideocoalition.com/michael-\ncioni-light-iron-founder-joins-frame-io-as-global-svp-of-innovation/) on films\nlike _Total Recall, The Green Hornet, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, Gone Girl,\nMuppets Most Wanted,_ and _The Social Network._\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NYC-Team-at-NYC-\nHQ.jpg?w=680)\n\nCioni will be heading up the new L.A. operation which will more specifically\nfocus on bringing the Frame.io platform to the areas of motion picture and\ntelevision production. In order to gain more traction in this market, the\ncompany plans to address industry concerns around image quality, archiving,\nsecurity and future proofing, [the company recently\nexplained](https://blog.frame.io/2019/10/09/michael-cioni/).\n\nIn addition, Cioni sees the potential for Frame.io to benefit from the growth\nof the streaming video market.\n\n\"As the 'streaming wars' motivate a historic level of content across the\nglobal media landscape, the need to optimize the relationship creatives have\nwith their content must also dramatically evolve,\" he says. \"Frame.io's cloud-\nenabled workflows will serve the community by building a centralized,\nparallel, zero-latency collaborative experience access all departments and\nacross all regions,\" he says. \"Our platform is not native to one department,\nrather Frame.io will become Hollywood's operating system that uniquely\nconnects the cloud, 5G network connections, production technologies, and a\ncentralized database with each individual department,\" Cioni stated.\n\nMeanwhile, on the security front, Frame.io has been ramping up on its focus\nsince February 2018 To date, it has added [TPN\ncompliance](https://blog.frame.io/2018/09/12/tpn-compliant/), [Soc 2 Type 2\ncompliance](https://blog.frame.io/2019/03/07/soc2-typ2-compliance/), plus\npublished a peer-reviewed [security research\npaper](https://www.usenix.org/node/216834), and received a [CSO security\naward](https://www.idg.com/news/cso-honors-organizations-leveraging-world-\nclass-security-strategies/), it says.\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Frame.io-Web-Player-\nPage.png?w=680)\n\nFrame.io is not without competition in the video management business. Vimeo\nhas been pivoting away from being a consumer-focused service to become a hub\nfor video creation tools for individuals, teams, businesses, agencies and\nothers, with particular focus on live video for social media, cross-platform\nstreaming, OTT, and more.\n\nMeanwhile, Wipster's rival video collaboration platform is used by Meredith,\nAMC, NPR, Time Inc., REI Studios, Sephora Studios, Shopify Studios, Deloitte\nStudios, and others, [according](https://wipster.io/plan-corporate) to its\nwebsite. However, its corporate video platform isn't designed for Hollywood,\nbut rather for use cases like HR review of internal video comms, legal reviews\nof external sales and marketing videos, subject matter expert reviews of\ntraining videos, creative reviews and signoffs on videos from external\nagencies and freelancers.\n\n\"We\u2019re thrilled to be partnering with Insight on this next round of financing.\nInsight deeply understands the creative space and the changing tides the film\nand video market will see over the next several years,\" said Emery Wells, co-\nfounder and CEO of Frame.io, in a statement. \"2019 has been a year of massive\ngrowth and of major milestones for us: we celebrated reaching 100 employees,\nmoved into brand new headquarters in lower Manhattan and, most recently,\nwelcomed industry veteran Michael Cioni to the team. We are driving to create\nthe most innovative approach to video workflows since the emergence of digital\n20 years ago.\"\n\n\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Beamery announces platform to help HR recruit and retain talent - TechCrunch", "link": "https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/beamery-announces-platform-to-help-hr-recruit-and-retain-talent/", "guid": "CAIiECKZCSNg7yfX5nc0npTfe2EqFAgEKg0IACoGCAowlIEBMLEXMOc_", "pubdate": "Thu, 12 Sep 2019 16:59:43 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/12/beamery-announces-platform-to-help-hr-recruit-and-retain-talent/\" target=\"_blank\">Beamery announces platform to help HR recruit and retain talent</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">TechCrunch</font>", "source": "TechCrunch", "body": "# Beamery announces platform to help HR recruit and retain talent\n\n[ Ron Miller ](https://techcrunch.com/author/) 7 months\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-93192840.jpg?w=600)\n\nAlmost every company has a talent problem. It's hard to find good employees\nand, once you do, to keep them happy. Today, [Beamery\n](https://crunchbase.com/organization/beamery) announced a fully integrated\nplatform to help solve that problem.\n\nCompany co-founder and CEO Abakar Saidov says that while drawing and retaining\ntalent can provide organizations with a key strategic advantage, there has\nbeen a dearth of digital tools to help. \"What we found was that there is no\nfundamental kind of operating system or system of record to be able to run\nthat part of the business,\" he said.\n\nWhile there are point solutions for different parts of the process, Beamery\nrecognized an opportunity to deliver a more complete platform. \"We essentially\nbuilt what we're calling a talent operating system, which encompasses the core\nprimary business objectives of what a company is trying to do with talent,\"\nSaidov explained.\n\nThat involves a suite of tools with the three key components around\nattracting, engaging and retaining talent, which Saidov says lines up in a way\nlike a sales and marketing process. The problem as he sees it, is that the\ntools available for sales and marketing lack a set of features companies need\nwhen it comes to talent.\n\nEach of the three components of the Beamery solution have been designed with\nhelping companies move through the talent workflow process. Attracting\ninvolves setting up micro sites for recruiting on the company website that are\nlinked to Beamery, along with an event planning tool for setting up something\nlike a campus recruitment day.\n\nThe Engage component involves a talent CRM database and marketing tools, while\nthe Retain piece is about helping employees apply for internal jobs and survey\ntools to get feedback throughout the process.\n\nThe solution also involves linking to other enterprise systems, so there is a\nmiddleware piece that enables companies to connect to other tools. Saidov said\nthat prior to today's announcement, the company offered the CRM and middleware\npieces, but it recognized all along that it needed a more complete solution.\nIt just took some time and money to develop it.\n\nIf you're wondering how this could work with LinkedIn, he says that it co-\nexists with it. Just as salespeople might find prospects in LinkedIn, then\nmanage the customer relationship in a CRM tool, recruiters can find candidates\nin LinkedIn and manage the recruitment process in Beamery. (One of the\ncompany's investors includes Microsoft Ventures. [Microsoft bought\nLinkedIn](https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/13/microsoft-to-buy-linkedin-\nfor-26b-in-cash-makes-big-move-into-enterprise-social-media/) in 2016 for\n$26.2 billion.)\n\nThe company has raised $40 million so far, according to Saidov, and today it\nhas 160 employees based in London, with offices in San Francisco and Austen.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Singapore Startup: This HR Tech Firm Worth $100 Million Is Ready To Conquer Asia - Forbes", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimjay/2019/10/08/singapore-startup-this-hr-tech-firm-worth-100-million-is-ready-to-conquer-asia/", "guid": "CAIiEHX6K5aOcMj62joezKw9T5IqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMI_CEg", "pubdate": "Sun, 13 Oct 2019 08:46:22 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimjay/2019/10/08/singapore-startup-this-hr-tech-firm-worth-100-million-is-ready-to-conquer-asia/\" target=\"_blank\">Singapore Startup: This HR Tech Firm Worth $100 Million Is Ready To Conquer Asia</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Forbes</font>", "source": "Forbes", "body": "Sign in to your Forbes account or\n\nregister\n\n## Please help us continue to provide you with free, quality journalism by\nturning off your ad blocker on our site.\n\nFor instructions on how to disable your ad blocker, [click\nhere.](https://www.forbes.com/adblock/instructions/)\n\n[I\u2019ve Turned Off My Ad\nBlocker](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimjay/2019/10/08/singapore-startup-\nthis-hr-tech-firm-worth-100-million-is-ready-to-conquer-asia/)\n\nOr Sign In To Continue Using An Ad Blocker\n\n### Thank you for signing in.\n\nIf this is your first time registering, please check your inbox for more\ninformation about the benefits of your Forbes account and what you can do\nnext!\n\n  * I agree to receive occasional updates and announcements about Forbes products and services.

What is\noften forgotten is the fact that some of the best startups in the world solve\nthe simplest of problems.\n\nThis is exactly the approach that Pascal Henry, who is the CEO and cofounder\nof [HReasily](https://www.hreasily.com/), took when he identified the\nfundamental needs of rapidly growing SMEs\u2013to manage their human resources more\nefficiently.\n\nHenry launched his Singapore-based HR firm in late 2015 as a [Software-as-a-\nService](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/03/19/the-top-\nthree-2019-saas-trends-and-how-theyre-changing-it-management/#154f808c71bc)\n(SaaS) business that enables companies to increase productivity by using\ntechnology to streamline traditional processes such as payroll processing,\nleave management and expense claims.\n\n**\u201c** When I was running my first startup in Singapore, I had to do a lot of\nthe manual processes myself. I felt the pain and the drain of it,\u201d explains\nHenry. \u201cIt was taking up a lot of my time and energy, when I should have been\nfocusing on building my business.\u201d\n\nToday In: [Asia](https://www.forbes.com/asia)\n\n  * [\n\n### To Prevent Global Depression, Governments Must Act Soon\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/yuwahedrickwong/2020/04/07/to-prevent-global-\ndepression-governments-must-act-soon/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Pandemic To Quicken Supply Shift From Mainland China, Benefit Taiwan R&D\n-- Amcham Taipei\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/russellflannery/2020/04/07/pandemic-to-\naccelerate-supply-shift-from-mainland-china-benefit-taiwan-amcham-taipei/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Another Epidemic?

As one of the fastest-growing cloud-based [HR SaaS\ncompanies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2016/07/18/the-hr-software-\nmarket-reinvents-itself/#e9e77df5d0af) in the region, their simple modules and\nfeatures aim to transform many of the legacy HR processes and automate them to\nbe accessible anytime and anywhere. Currently the company offers seven modules\nincluding payroll, staff leave, employee contracts and attendance. As HReasily\ngrows, it continues to add product lines aimed at empowering companies to\nscale faster.\n\nPreviously, many businesses used solutions that each looked after a particular\nsilo of an HR department. So you\u2019d have one system to manage your payroll\ncalculations, one for leave and others for other functions.\n\n\u201cWhat happened was you had to log in and out of many various systems, and\nthese systems cost a huge amount of money,\u201d says Henry. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is\nbuild a solution that is very affordable that integrates with all the\nfunctions on a unified platform.\u201d\n\n**A simple but elegant business model**\n\nHReasily runs a [subscription-based revenue\nmodel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/12/whats-behind-\nthe-rise-of-the-subscription-model/#56543b1e35c3). Starting with payroll,\nwhich is at the core of every traditional HR office, the company offers\npremium versions that run on monthly or yearly subscriptions, with add-on\nmodules available such as staff leave and time attendance. This past summer at\nthe [RISE 2019 conference](https://riseconf.com/) in Hong Kong, Henry and his\nteam unveiled their latest benefits management module which will soon allow\ncustomers to acquire group level insurance, healthcare and even apply for\ncredit cards or loans.\n\nHReasily says its competitive advantage lies in its customer base, which is\nmostly SMEs. By initially focusing on the fundamental needs of this particular\nsegment, the company has earned the support of larger banking and government\nagencies and has become known as an \u201cSME champion.\u201d Not surprisingly, as the\ncompany has grown it says that it began to attract larger corporations,\npublicly listed companies, multinational corporations and even payroll\noutsourcing firms.\n\n\u201cAs we grew we acquired a more diverse customer base,\u201d Henry says, \u201cbecause a\nlot of larger companies are tired of the older and expensive solutions because\nthey need to be installed on premise and they require a refresher every year\nwhen rules and regulations change.\u201d\n\n**Partnerships are the key to rapid growth**\n\nBeing based in Singapore has allowed HReasily to capitalize on the rapid\ngrowth in[ Southeast\nAsia](https://www.forbes.com/sites/vinnielauria/2019/05/14/big-upsurge-in-e-\ncommerce-drives-southeast-asias-online-economy/#77c08fc83309). SME\u2019s account\nfor 97% of all the enterprises in the region, and employ half of the\nworkforce, according to data from Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).\nHReasily\u2019s growth has been nothing short of impressive. With nearly 30,000\ncompanies on their platform and more than 100 new companies onboarding every\nday, HReasily is said to be growing rapidly in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia,\nIndonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.\n\nSome of HReasily\u2019s notable customers include Love Bonito (in Singapore,\nIndonesia, Malaysia and Hong Kong), Sambat Finance (Cambodia), OnlinePajak\n(Indonesia) and TechInAsia. As the company looks to complete their coverage of\nAsia, the next major market they look to tackle is mainland China followed by\nTaiwan, Japan, Myanmar and Australia.\n\nInvestors have taken notice of the company\u2019s growth as well. Fresh off a pre-\nseries A [funding\nround](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/hreasily-receives-\nus-5-million-investment-from-envy-capital-1028514742) of $5 million from Envy\nCapital, HReasily is currently estimated to be valued at more than $100\nmillion. Henry admits that the company\u2019s rapid growth in the region has only\nbeen possible with the early support from their key strategic partners.\n\nHReasily has been working with Citibank, Mazars and Stripe. The partnership\nwith [Mazars](https://www.mazars.co.th/Home/News/Mazars-in-the-press/Mazars-\ndevelops-its-digital-services-with-HReasily), which was a lead investor from\nthe startup\u2019s first round of funding, gives them access to a global audit,\nadvisory and payroll outsourcing firm with 300 offices in 100 countries. Henry\nsays it allows HReasily to localize its solutions to each individual market.\n\n**\u201c** Today, building a solid ecosystem of strategic partners is very\nimportant because you come from different angles, but you all serve one\ncustomer, which is the SME or the business,\u201d says Henry. \u201cBy coming together,\nwe collectively create a great end-to-end experience for them. There\u2019s\nstrength in numbers.\u201d\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/jaykimmer) or\n[LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jaykimmer).

The competition for talent makes it critical for recruiters to be\nwhere their candidates are \u2013 online, and that means developing social media\nrecruiting strategies for effective candidate sourcing. Utilizing social\nplatforms to effectively network with potential job candidates requires a few\nbasic dos and don\u2019ts.\n\n## **Social Media Recruiting Dos**\n\n### **Use different platforms to target candidates**\n\n  \nEach social media platform has a unique audience, making it important for\nrecruiters to do their homework in terms of selecting the right social media\nchannel to connect with target candidates. LinkedIn, for example, is a great\nplace to reach higher-level management candidates, while Facebook\u2019s larger\ntalent pool of 2.41 billion monthly active users allows recruiters to expand\ntheir reach and cast a wider net in searching for qualified candidates. With\nmany visual and creative job seekers showcasing their work and portfolios on\ntheir social media channels, recruiters can use sites like Pinterest and\nInstagram to conduct initial candidate searches.\n\n### **Create a compelling recruiter profile**\n\n  \nA recruiter\u2019s profile should be just as impressive as top-notch candidate\nprofiles. Candidates are attracted to working with people they like, and this\nmakes it important to create a profile that people will enjoy visiting. The\nfirst step is to feature a professional profile photo, which may seem obvious,\nbut it\u2019s often overlooked. They can also include information about themselves\nthat will act as a conversation starter. Basic information such as tenure at\nthe company and background in the recruiting industry is also important.\nRecruiters should also consider featuring positive feedback and/or reviews\nfrom successful candidate placements on their profiles.\n\n### **Participate in groups**\n\nSocial media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn have groups geared toward\nspecialized topics and communities. Becoming consistently active in relevant\ngroups for recruiting efforts can help identify talent and attract candidates\nin specific areas of expertise. Consistent participation in these groups is\nkey to establishing relationships with group member, but content shouldn\u2019t be\nlimited to just job postings. Recruiters should visit target group pages daily\nand find opportunities to comment on a post, ask and answer questions and\nhighlight relevant industry news.\n\n### **Use video**\n\n  \nRecruiters should leverage video to attract the attention of job seekers.\nVideo is now the number one way people spend time online, with Cisco\nprojecting that by 2020, one million minutes of video will cross the internet\nevery second, and by 2021, 82% of all internet traffic will be from video.\n\nA study by CareerBuilder illustrates the powerful impact of video on\nrecruiting. The study found that job postings that featured a video or linked\nto a video received 12% more views than postings without video. This same\nstudy found, on average, employers adding video to job postings receive a 34%\ngreater candidate application rate.\n\nRecruiters can integrate video in their recruiting strategies by using it to\nhighlight the employer brand and employee value proposition.\n\n### **Optimize for mobile**\n\n  \nIt is also important for recruiters to be sure that all job posting ads on\nsocial media sites and company websites are mobile-friendly. With 77% of U.S.\nadults owning smartphones, according to a [2018 survey by the Pew Research\nCenter](https://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheet/mobile/), more and more job\nseekers are relying on mobile phones to search for and apply for jobs. A\nGlassdoor study found that the majority of Glassdoor users, 58%, are looking\nfor their jobs on their phones. Many social media sites are optimized for\nmobile and make it easy to apply. Job postings that are optimized for mobile\nviewing will help ensure candidates don\u2019t get frustrated and abandon the\napplication process.\n\n**Learn More:[Social Media\u2019s Impact on Culture and Cybersecurity in the\nWorkplace](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/safety/social-medias-\nimpact-on-culture-and-cybersecurity-in-the-workplace/)**\n\n## **Social Media Recruiting Don\u2019ts**\n\n### **Don\u2019t spam candidates**\n\n  \nDon\u2019t send generic messages to candidates. No one likes to receive messages\nfrom recruiters that are not relevant to them. Instead of spamming candidates,\nwork to start a dialogue that builds relationships with them. Personalized\nmessages tailored to the experience and background of the candidate are much\nmore effective in attracting attention and generating responses.\n\n### **Don\u2019t over-post**\n\n  \nIt might be tempting to share a lot of content, but recruiters should evaluate\nthe content they are posting in the context of whether or not it is relevant\nto target candidates. Avoid posting anything repetitive and ensure that all\nposted content is professional, original and authentic. Focusing on quality\nover quantity will help recruiters increase their following and engagement\nwith target candidates.\n\nAs recruiters embrace social media platforms to extend their global reach,\nattract quality candidates, speed recruitment sourcing and reduce costs, their\nsocial media strategies will need to move beyond simply creating a profile and\nreaching out to candidates. Implementing social media best practices and\navoiding mistakes will help recruiters build stronger connections with\ncandidates and attract top talent.\n\n**Learn More:[5 Tips on Social Media\nRecruiting](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/5-elements-of-a-killer-social-recruiting-strategy/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fsocial-media-recruiting-dos-and-\ndonts%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Social+Media+Recruiting+Dos+and+Don%E2%80%99ts\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Social+Media+Recruiting+Dos+and+Don%E2%80%99ts&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fsocial-media-recruiting-dos-and-\ndonts%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fsocial-media-recruiting-dos-and-\ndonts%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fsocial-media-recruiting-dos-and-\ndonts%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Social Media Recruiting Dos and\nDon\u2019ts&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fsocial-media-recruiting-dos-and-\ndonts%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

We\nall have a camera in our pockets, and nearly anyone can live video chat with\nminimal barrier to entry. Today, the ability to connect to anyone in the world\nthrough video is easier than ever \u2014 and it will only get easier as\n[technology](https://www.aithority.com/category/technology/) advances.\n\nOne emerging trend in the video space is live-streaming, or streaming video\nsimultaneously captured and broadcast in real time. But live video has a\ndangerous downside: the lack of control. There\u2019s no \u201coops\u201d button when live-\nstreaming \u2014 anything can happen, and it\u2019s difficult to contain what happens to\nthe content. In some cases, videos are already recorded and downloaded before\na stream is shut down.\n\nAs live-streaming continues to evolve, many forward-thinking content\nproducers, developers and streaming platforms are beginning to invoke\n[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aithority.com/tag/artificial-\nintelligence/) (AI) to help regulate the dangers of live-streaming.\n\n####  **Video, Video, Video**\n\nAs more companies in more verticals turn to video to bolster their [Digital\nMarketing](https://www.aithority.com/tag/digital-marketing/) and [Social\nMedia](https://www.aithority.com/tag/social-media/) efforts, it\u2019s increasingly\napparent that video is not going away anytime soon. In fact, according to\nrecent research from [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/service-\nprovider/visual-networking-index-vni/index.html), internet video traffic made\nup 69% of all global consumer internet traffic in 2017, and by the year 2022,\nit will account for a whopping 82%.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t always the case. When internet services first became available\nto consumers, even the shortest of videos could take as long as 10 minutes to\ndownload and the result was often a fuzzy picture that required significant\nbandwidth to buffer. Today however, almost anyone is able to broadcast full-\nscreen, high-definition (HD) video \u2014 streamed in real time to anyone, anywhere\n\u2014 in a matter of milliseconds.\n\n _ **Read More:**_[Gen Z Sales Teams Don\u2019t Have Time to Stop and\nSign](https://www.aithority.com/guest-authors/gen-z-sales-teams-dont-have-\ntime-to-stop-and-sign/ \"Gen Z Sales Teams Don\u2019t Have Time to Stop and Sign\")\n\n####  **Live Video Streaming**\n\nWhile internet users, especially\n[millennials](https://www.aithority.com//?s=millennials), are consuming a\nseemingly ever-increasing amount of Video content, entirely new forms of\n[Video content](https://www.aithority.com/tag/video-content/) are emerging.\nBeyond broadcasting live events like sports games, entertainment events,\nwebinars or the coverage of a developing news story, user-generated content\n(UGC) is on the rise.\n\nTraditionally, Video On Demand (VOD), the programming system that allows users\nto select and watch Video content whenever they choose, has dominated the\nonline video market. But trends are shifting toward the advantages live-\nstreaming offers. In fact, the average time spent watching live video is\nhigher than VOD on [mobile](http://tubularinsights.com/live-video-vod-per-\nplay/#ixzz4JTvPtK7v) (3.5 minutes vs. 2.8 minutes),\n[tablets](http://tubularinsights.com/live-video-vod-per-play/#ixzz4JTvPtK7v)\n(7.1 vs. 4.1) and especially for users watching on their\n[desktop](http://tubularinsights.com/live-video-vod-per-play/#ixzz4JTvPtK7v)\n(34.5 vs. 2.6).\n\nLive-streaming events like presidential rallies and other historical events,\ncrucial moments during sporting events, playing of video games and other\noccurrences allows content creators to connect with both friends and a wider\naudience. When used in a positive manner, streaming can help create brand\nidentity, showcase talent, develop skills in communication and be used as a\ntool in campaigns. But despite the opportunities for sharing and\ninterconnection live-streaming presents, it can be unpredictable as well as\ndifficult to moderate.\n\n####  **The Dangerous Downside of Live-streaming**\n\nBeyond improved opportunities for connecting with the world, [live-\nstreaming](https://www.aithority.com/tag/live-video-streaming-services/) can\nalso open the door for viewers to see gruesome and uncensored content. From\n[fatal car accidents](https://tribune.com.pk/story/1459390/czech-woman-\nstreams-fatal-car-accident-facebook-live/) and[ incidents of\ntorture](https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/us/chicago-facebook-live-\nbeating/index.html) to [sexual assaults](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-\neurope-38717186) and\n[suicides](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/france-\nlivestreamed-suicide/482328/), the live-streaming of crimes and other horrific\nincidents on various channels and platforms is on the rise. Experiences once\nrestricted to individuals or small communities can now be shared, in real\ntime, by anyone, and some streams are now reaching [millions of audience\nmembers](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/331502/super-bowl-\nsets-streaming-viewership-record.html).\n\nIn addition to the threat posed by being exposed to horrific uncensored\ncontent that live-streaming can enable, a number of auxiliary risks also need\nto be considered by live-streaming channels, platforms and applications, as\nwell as government organizations and the general public.\n\nBecause children and teenagers can live-stream video themselves, in some\ncases, nearly anyone \u2014 including child predators \u2014 can access that stream. For\nchild predators and others intent on taking advantage of impressionable young\npeople, live-streaming enables the ability to view the child or teen in an\nunedited and overly familiar moment, with little to no incriminating data made\navailable because it remains difficult to track who is streaming or monitor\nthe content of the stream in real time.\n\nAdditionally, the question of consent comes into play with live-streams. When\nbroadcasting for the world to see, viewers who the streamer doesn\u2019t want to\ninclude or who haven\u2019t given consent can still access the streamed video.\nLive-streaming services often have limited privacy controls, and as a result,\nit can be difficult to determine who is watching and prevent unwanted viewers\nfrom accessing the stream.\n\nCompounding the problem, issues surrounding accidentally revealing one\u2019s\nlocation or other intimate information have cropped up. These issues have\nopened the door for viewers to commit crimes both remotely and in person.\nConsider the consequences arising from celebrity\n[stalking](http://kotaku.com/when-fans-take-their-love-for-twitch-streamers-\ntoo-far-1794815112), [swatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting)\n(defined as \u201cthe action or practice of making a prank call to emergency\nservices in an attempt to bring about the dispatch of a large number of armed\npolice officers to a particular address\u201d) and\n[doxxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing) (or publishing private or\nidentifying information about (a particular individual) on the internet,\ntypically with malicious intent) as some of the other other potential pitfalls\nof live-streaming Video content.\n\nSo how can online platforms, live-streaming channels and other applications\npublishing and recording live-streams regulate their Video content to keep\nviewers, individual streamers, businesses and other content creators safe from\npotential pitfalls?\n\n _ **Read More:**_[Topic Detection: What Is It All\nAbout?](https://www.aithority.com/guest-authors/topic-detection-what-is-it-\nall-about/ \"Topic Detection: What Is It All About?\")\n\n####  **AI to the Rescue**\n\nEnter Artificial Intelligence. Already widely employed across a variety of\nindustries to communicate with customers, streamline tasks and deliver [Big\nData](https://www.aithority.com//?s=Big%20Data) insights, AI is set to\ntransform video live-streaming as well. Currently, AI is being used for viewer\nmetrics, network and technical troubleshooting, [recommendations\n](https://www.aithority.com//?s=recommendations)and ad serving, but there are\nmany other potential uses, including the swift regulation of content.\n\nWith the volume of data being generated from video set to increase from its\nalready overwhelming usage today, the information derived from this data can\nbe used to regulate streaming content. We can expect AI to be able to\ninterpret streaming content and automatically extract metadata from\ndescriptive tags, categories and summaries. This will pave the way for more\nintelligent analytics, content insights and content management, thus paving\nthe way for enhanced regulation as a means to protect the privacy of streamers\nand to more effectively monitor potentially harmful content.\n\nConsider AI analyzing a live video with no human interference or regulation.\nModern applications can recognize hundreds of thousands of natural language\nqueries, allowing users the ability to search footage and find clips showing\nspecific animals, people wearing clothes of a certain color, individual car\nmakes and models, and much more. AI has worked well for the regulation of\nincidents that include nudity, propaganda related to terrorism and graphic\nviolence where there is a large number of examples available to train systems,\nbut some videos simply won\u2019t trigger automatic detection systems. Another\nchallenge is discerning dangerous content from visually similar, innocuous\ncontent.\n\nWhile other regulations like delaying live-streams and flagging videos with a\nhigh number of live viewers for immediate monitoring exist, AI\u2019s ability to\nremove humans from the monitoring process offers a lot of promise in\nminimizing the harm caused by dangerous live-streams. Even though AI systems\nneed to be trained with copious amounts of data to effectively keep an eye on\nlive-streams, the advantages offered by Artificial Intelligence cannot be\noverlooked. As video grows increasingly popular and more people consume live\nvideo content, live-streaming platforms, channels and services should consider\nemploying AI to keep our increasingly digital world that much safer.\n\n _ **Read More:**_[CMOs are Overlooking Key Opportunities to Drive Growth\nThrough Search Engine

Saxena: Article\nAuthor\")\n\nEntrepreneur Staff\n\nDeputy Associate Editor, Asia Pacific\n\n[__](https://twitter.com/aparajitawrites)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aparajita-\nsaxena)\n\nWith the coronavirus still continuing to spread across the world, we've put\ntogether a handy guide on best practices companies and human resources\ndepartments should follow to help their employees stay healthy and infection-\nfree.\n\n\n\n### Effective Communication is Key\n\nHR departments should pull together information pertaining to the coronavirus\nto create a ready-to-refer instructional guide for employees that not only\neducates them about the viral infection, but also enlists ways to avoid it.\n\nThe communication strategy should be multi-pronged and use all channels of\ncommunication available.\n\n\"You are looking at bulletins, sticking posters on the wall, emails, chat\ngroups, town hall, infographics, videos, and any mode of media that could help\nto effectively communicate the message to all employees,\" says Adrian Tan, a\nveteran HR practitioner and APAC leader of PeopleStrong, an India-based\nEnterprise HR SaaS platform.\n\nInformation gathered should only be from credible and verified sources, such\nas the [page](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus), the CDC\n[website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/about/symptoms.html), and reputable\nnews outlets that clearly attribute their information to either statements\nmade by governmental agencies, or health professionals engaged in researching\nthe virus.\n\nCheck out [this Bloomberg\nstory](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-29/coronavirus-\nmisinformation-is-incubating-all-over-social-media) that busts some myths and\nhighlights false information about coronavirus making the rounds online.\n\n\n\n### Implement Flexible Working Arrangement Plans, or BCP Protocols\n\nFor those in the thick of it - like countries that share a border with China,\nor have multiple reported cases of a coronavirus infection - allowing\nemployees to work from home is the best way to prevent contamination given\nthat human-to-human transmission is possible.\n\n\"By implementing flexible working arrangements, you are not just eliminating\nthe possibility of transmission at the office but also during commute. This is\nespecially so for densely populated cities such as Hong Kong where you are\nliterally inches away from someone's face in the MTR during peak hours,\" says\nTan.\n\nThis holds true for many other countries with packed urban centres as well.\n\n\"Given the better infrastructure that we have today, it is much easier to be\n\"business-as-usual\" with chat platforms, project management dashboards and\nother platforms that are online or on the cloud,\" he adds.\n\nThis might not be possible for work that is location-dependent though, but the\n[CDC ](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/actions-prevent-flu.htm)and WHO\nwebsites have laid out ways to avoid viral infections by using non-invasive\nimplements such as face masks, alcohol-based hand sanitisers, and maintaining\ngood personal hygiene.\n\n\n\n### Reconsider Leave Policies\n\nThe last thing a company would want is for an infected employee to turn up to\nwork because they didn't have enough paid time off left. That not only hurts\nthe sick employee who has had to stress him/herself out to get to work, but\nalso their colleagues, as well as everyone and everything they encounter and\ntouch on the way.\n\n\"If the company is results-driven, whether the employee works from home or in\nthe office should not matter as long as the work is being delivered. Given the\ndevelopments in technology today, there is a suite of solutions for companies\nto use such that meetings, discussions and day-to-day work can go on per\nnormal,\" Tan says.\n\nFor employees that are suspected of being sick, or start feeling ill during\nthe day, particularly those that have been travelling, calling and notifying\nhealth authorities should be a priority. Fear mongering and forcing the\nemployee into isolation, against their will, should be avoided at all costs,\nuntil advised by a medical authority.\n\n\n\n### Using Tech to Avoid Human Contact Might not be such a bad thing\n\nPlatforms that allow teams to collaborate and communicate effectively can be\nused during work-from-home days. Meetings can be done over Skype, Google\nHangouts, or Zoom, while real-time collaborations can be done using free\nplatforms like [Collabedit](http://collabedit.com/).\n\n(Read about more collaborative tools you can use\n[here](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/336214) and\n[here](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/321006).)\n\n\n\n### Other HR Initiatives, Apart From Handing Out Free Masks, According to Tan\n\n  * Beside provisioning free masks and sanitisers, the cleaning schedule of the office can be increased.\n  * Senior management has to walk the talk to ensure they mask up wherever appropriate to.\n  * Temperature taking could be incorporated so that everyone in the office would have a peace of mind and not be paranoid that their co-workers may be infected. Such information should be openly available so that employees have complete trust in the information provided.\n  * Lastly, lunch could be catered so as to minimize employees exposure to crowded areas like the food centre.\n\n## Latest on Entrepreneur\n\nCommercial Enquiries\n\nFor all commercial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [sales@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:sales@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nAffiliated Sites\n\n  * [Franchise India](http://www.franchiseindia.com)\n  * [Indian Retailer ](http://www.indianretailer.com/)\n  * [Restaurant India](http://www.franchiseindia.com/restaurant)\n  * [WellnessIndia.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/wellness)\n  * [EducationBiz.com](http://www.franchiseindia.com/education)\n  * [LicenseIndia.com](http://www.licenseindia.com)\n\nEditorial Enquiries\n\nFor all editorial enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact [editor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:editor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nCompany\n\n  * [Advertise](http://entrepreneurindia.com/advertisement/)\n\nProducts\n\n  * [Franchise](/franchise)\n  * [Podcasts](/listen)\n  * [Books](https://bookstore.entrepreneur.com)\n\nContributor Enquiries\n\nFor all contributor enquiries related to Entrepreneur Asia Pacific, please\ncontact\n[contributor@entrepreneurapj.com](mailto:contributor@entrepreneurapj.com)\n\nEditions\n\n  * [United States](/us)\n  * [India](/in)\n  * [Asia Pacific](/ap)\n  * [Middle East](/me)\n  * [Europe](/eu)\n  * [Espa\u00f1ol](/es)\n  * [Georgia](/ga)\n  * [South Africa](/sa)\n\nGet the Magazine\n\n[ ![Edition: March\n2020](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x4/600/20200307084422-EntrepreneurMarchCover.jpeg?width=150&quality=15)\n](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n  * [Subscribe](http://www.franchiseindia.com/emagazine/shop/)\n\n[![Entrepreneur](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20180405100041-entrepreneur-\nasia-pacific-white.svg)](/)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/EntAsiaPacific\n\"Facebook\")[__](https://twitter.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Twitter\")[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/entrepreneur-media-india\n\"LinkedIn\")[__](https://www.pinterest.com/entrepreneurmedia\n\"Pinterest\")[__](https://www.instagram.com/entrepreneurapj\n\"Instagram\")[__](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5Q3EHcO5kH9oaD4oaMvjw\n\"YouTube\")\n\n[Terms of Use](/terms-of-service) [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy) [Cookies\nPolicy](/cookie-policy) [Site Map](/sitemaps/main)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Entrepreneur Media, Inc.

intelligence continues to skyrocket within the HR\nrealm, related ethics issues represent real risk if not handled correctly, and\nearly.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | February 13, 2020 \u2022 10 min read\n\nTopics: [HR Leadership](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrleadership/) |

[Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/AI.Technology.Getty_.2.12.20-700x515.jpg)\n\n(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\n\nThe debate over artificial intelligence\u2019s role in HR\u2014from recruiting to\nworkforce planning to performance\u2014has become moot: There's no doubt that AI\nhas arrived and is expanding rapidly in the HR space. But, not so fast, some\nexperts say. While AI represents a fantastic opportunity to drive HR success\n(and by extension, bottom-line growth), ethical issues tied to AI represent a\npotential dark side of these technologies.\n\nThe good news is, chief HR and people officers can successfully navigate this\nrapidly changing, growing trend by steering clear of those ethical speed bumps\nin the first place. They must take a smart, steady, planned approach to\ncircumvent negative outcomes.\n\nHowever, surveys show that HR leaders are not sure they have that situation\nunder control quite yet.\n\nFor example, Deloitte\u2019s 2019 [_Global Human Capital\nTrends_](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/human-capital-\ntrends.html) survey found that 22% of 10,000 respondents in 119 countries are\nusing AI within their organizations; plus, 81% predicted growth in the use of\nAI. Yet, in the same survey, a mere 6% said they are \u201cvery ready\u201d to address\nthe impact (ethics issues included) of AI and related solutions\u2014including\ncognitive technologies and robotic-process automation (RPA)\u2014on their\nworkforces.\n\nAlso, a recent joint report from Willis Towers Watson and the Society of Human\nResource Management found that 36% of chief people officers say they are\nprepared to think about how technology such as AI can be used to execute work\nin the future\u2014but only 26% report they have the technical acumen to evaluate\nthese new, growing technologies.\n\nClearly, the rise of AI and machine learning are creating both demand and\ndissonance among HR leaders globally. It seems AI can be a true HR savior or,\non the flip side, can create a slippery slope leading to potentially damaging\nconsequences. Execution is critical.\n\n**Define the Goals**\n\nBy and large, many organizations are \u201chorribly unprepared for answering the\nquestion around how to ethically use the data they collect for effective AI\nuse, for a variety of reasons,\u201d says Brian Kropp, group vice president with\nGartner.\n\nFor one thing, Kropp says, many HR leaders are not really thinking about this\nchallenge to the degree they should. He offers the example of business\nleaders, HR or otherwise, trying to use the data that's being collected to\nmake decisions outside the scope of what the information was intended for.\n\n[![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/SolutionSpotlight-250x324.png)](https://hrexecutive.com/solutions-\nspotlight-january-2020/)\n\nClick here for innovative new tech options in our Solutions Spotlight.\n\nFor instance, Kropp encountered one company that had been tracking when\nemployees come in and out of the building, with the original goal of trying to\nfigure out what sort of real-estate footprint it needed. As it turned out, at\nthe same time, executives were looking to trim headcount. One of the business\nleaders figured it was OK to use the data to root out employees who were\ncoming in late or leaving early. In essence, those employees could be\nexpendable because they weren\u2019t committed to the organization. That strategy\ndidn\u2019t happen (HR stepped in and stopped it), but it makes a clear point about\nethical considerations when it comes to data use.\n\n\u201cIt's not that those business leaders were mean, terrible people,\u201d Kropp\nexplains. \u201cThey're smart, creative leaders trying to better understand their\nbusiness and using this data to try to help make decisions. But things can\nturn out quite differently in a case like this.\u201d\n\nIn another example, Kropp says, companies might scrape internal communications\ndata using AI to try to gauge employee sentiment\u2014on its face, a great idea.\nBut if they say they\u2019re keeping the data confidential and anonymous, what\nhappens when, during data collection, an employee reports internally being\nsexually harassed at work?\n\nHR leaders are in a bind because they feel they should investigate the claim,\nyet they also said data collection would be confidential and not attributed to\nany individual.\n\n\u201cWhat is the appropriate ethical use of that data?\u201d Kropp asks. \u201cThat's where\nethical violations will occur. It\u2019s important to be certain you're not doing\nanything to cause non-intended results or skewed or biased results, which will\nruin efforts to use the data for good.\u201d\n\n**Strive for Transparency**\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ravin-Jesuthasan-\nCMYKforPrepress-2-150x150.jpg)\n\nRavin Jesuthasan\n\nRavin Jesuthasan, author and managing director at Willis Towers Watson, says\nthat, while AI certainly has the potential to transform and reinvent HR, it is\nimperative that HR leaders continue to enhance their digital acumen\u2014which\nincludes having a detailed understanding of the mechanics and consequences\n(intended or otherwise) of AI.\n\n\u201cAI needs data to power it, but the data need to be bias-free and ethically\nacquired,\u201d he says, citing Unilever\u2019s use of AI in talent acquisition as a\nprime example. \u201cThey were actually able to reduce the bias in their recruiting\nby explicitly ensuring that addresses and hobbies were not considered by their\nalgorithm. HR needs to create the space to learn and practice in this domain.\u201d\n\nIt is also critical that HR embraces a mindset of perpetual reinvention,\nincluding a culture of continuous learning and experimentation, he adds.\n\n\u201cHR needs to make digital enablement part of its core capabilities and not a\n\u2018hobby,\u2019 \u201d Jesuthasan says. \u201cThis means dedicated roles and continuous market\nscanning to understand the latest developments in technology and how they\nmight be leveraged by the organization and HR.\u201d\n\nMeg Bear, senior vice president of products at SAP SuccessFactors, says AI-\npowered technology has been rapidly growing over the last several years, but\nemployers are just scratching the surface, with most still experimenting.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\n\u201cEvery vendor is recognizing that using AI to automate and accelerate high-\nvolume business processes\u2014like matching qualified candidates to jobs and\nidentifying career suggestions based on \u2018people like me\u2019\u2014is beginning to pave\nthe way for better efficiencies,\u201d she says.\n\nBear cites example of sales teams accessing real-time information and guided\nassistance to help them close deals. Also, business leaders can use real-time\ncomprehensive business data (sales, finance, operations) to predict\noutcomes\u2014leading to better-informed decisions on where to invest time and\nmoney. And data will not only predict outcomes but can demonstrate results,\nmaking it possible to test and learn at scale.\n\nUltimately, she says, AI will help HR professionals directly impact business\nresults in a way that aligns with the new pace of competition. But Bear also\nissues a warning: AI should be leveraged to augment the human experience\u2014not\nreplace it.\n\n\u201cTechnology is a force multiplier, and AI is an exciting new capability,\u201d she\nsays, noting that SAP SuccessFactors is working with global customers to make\nsure it applies the right technology to improve business outcomes. \u201cWe are\nmindful of both the benefits and risks of AI, so we have established ethical\nguidelines to guide us and are always focused on the importance of\nreliability, security, privacy and quality.\u201d\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Montra_ellis-\nHeadshot-150x150.jpg)\n\nMontra Ellis\n\nAccording to Montra Ellis, senior director of product innovation at Ultimate\nSoftware, AI\u2014in the short term\u2014will likely have the greatest impact on\nrecruiting, with recruiters looking to cast the widest possible net to find\ndiverse candidates. On the other hand, they don\u2019t want to \u201cdrown\u201d in\napplicants who don\u2019t match a candidate profile.\n\nDespite recent examples to the contrary (such as Amazon\u2019s now-scrapped AI tool\nthat discriminated against women), Ellis says she believes that software, when\ndeployed correctly, is critical to addressing hiring bias. One of the main\nissues with AI-assisted recruiting today means identifying a \u201cgood\u201d candidate\nis a process that involves evaluating both objective and subjective skills,\nshe says. Unfortunately, biases\u2014conscious or unconscious\u2014exist and can creep\ninto the examination of a candidate\u2019s resume or expertise.\n\nTo truly move beyond potential biases, Ellis says, companies must incorporate\nthird-party software tools that have access to millions upon millions of\naggregated data points\u2014from all types of industries, companies and\ngeographies\u2014to dilute individual company or industry bias and introduce\ndiversity into the training set.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the ethics of AI, one of the most important actions a\ncompany can take is to strive for clarity and transparency on the impact AI\nsoftware will have on their employees and customers,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cWhether\nit\u2019s respecting privacy or ensuring that all voices are heard, the more\ntransparency in AI\u2019s role, the easier it will be to welcome these advancements\nas an augmentation, rather than fear them as a replacement.\u201d\n\n**\u2018Automate to Elevate\u2019**\n\nAbove all, Ellis notes, AI within HR realms must \u201cwork for the people and\nnever against them. I fundamentally believe that the role of AI is to amplify\nthe power of people, not replace them.\u201d\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/Cristina_Goldtcq5dam.thumbnail.500.500-150x150.png)\n\nCristina Goldt\n\nCristina Goldt, vice president of HCM products at Workday, says the HR\nindustry is seeing the increased use of machines to surface predictions and\ndata-driven insights, but Workday itself continues to rely on people to make\njudgments about those predictions and insights.\n\n\u201cHR is increasingly leaning on data insights to drive decision-making,\u201d she\nsays. \u201cWe\u2019re also evolving towards a paradigm where the data find us through\npersonalized recommendations, such as curated tasks, learning recommendations\nand story-based reporting.\u201d\n\nShe says machine learning is and will continue to drive increased efficiency\nin HR. For example, machines can find anomalies in processes, such as payroll\nor boost recruiting success, and can also sort through resumes and surface\ncandidates who are strong matches.\n\n\u201cWe have too much data to sift through manually, so machine learning is\nhelping us \u2018automate to elevate,\u2019 \u201d she says. By that, she means automating\nwhere it makes sense to work at the pace of business today and elevating HR to\na more advisory role by leaving tactical tasks to the machines. In addition,\nshe says, this increase in data volume is going to naturally force reporting\nto evolve\u2014a need for a smarter, \u201cstory-based\u201d reporting model to help make\nsense of the data and surface insights. This new era of augmented analytics is\ngoing to be a game-changer for organizations and a way to help amplify HR\u2019s\ndata literacy, Goldt explains.\n\n\u201cThere will be a natural evolution that we might not notice until we look back\nand reflect. For example, in the last few years, we\u2019ve started to rely on\ndigital assistants [think Alexa, Siri and Waze] in our consumer lives. In the\nnext two to three years, the enterprise space will catch up.\u201d\n\nGartner\u2019s Kropp says companies, and HR executives in particular, should create\ntheir own employee \u201cBill of Rights\u201d on data, focusing on how they're going to\nuse the data they collect. What are the things they agree to do or not do with\ndata needed for an effective AI strategy? For example, are they going to be\ntransparent with employees about what data they actually collect? Are they\ngoing to turn over decisions to an algorithm, or is the algorithm only going\nto provide recommendations, and a human being has to sign off on every\ndecision?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding\u2014and what we really believe\u2014is that, if companies don't create\ntheir AI ethics Bill of Rights, then what will invariably happen is that well-\nmeaning business leaders will use that data and information with the best of\nintentions but potentially make ethically poor decisions,\u201d he says.\n\nAnother strategy Kropp offers is using AI within HR to create a new role in\nthe company, a \u201chead of data ethics,\u201d so to speak. That person preferably\nshould be housed within HR, not IT or legal, because HR represents the most\nbalanced, innovative approach to data ethics.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nAs an alternative, some employers are partnering with academics at their local\nuniversities to help them sort out the ethical dilemmas existing with AI use.\n\n\u201cThe major challenge is, when an issue arises, do you have a set of rules that\nyou can look at and say, \u2018Here's how we deal with this,\u2019 \u201d Kropp says.\n\u201cBecause, in the moment, it is human nature to take the easiest path, which\nmay not be the right one. To get to a result that is the least painful\nregarding the use of AI, you have to have the rules set in place before you\nare confronted with a problem.\u201d\n\n\n\n> A CHRO's tech wishlist\n\n\n\n**Better video tools for connecting workers**\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/billie1-150x150.png)\n\nBillie Hartless\n\n\u201cWe can never overcome the fact that geography does play a role in driving\nhigh performance and we can\u2019t get as rich of an experience with video and\ncollaboration tools as we do face-to-face. Building rapport in relationships\nis still critically important, though video can go a long way toward helping\ncreate that connection. The technology is getting smarter and smarter but,\nstill, when I facilitate online meetings with multiple people, we have people\ntalking over each other. I think the continuation of the technology we\u2019re\nseeing, where video is able to focus in on the person who is talking and mute\nmics of others, can really help create great online meetings.\u201d\n\n\u2014Billie Hartless, CHRO, Mitel\n\n\n\n\n\n**A tool that accurately measures culture**\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Niovitch-\nDavis_Karen-150x150.jpg)\n\nKaren Niovitch Davis\n\nKaren Davis, Partner and CHRO at Prosek Partners\n\n\u201cWorking in HR, I\u2019ve tried to find the balance between efficient automation\nand human interaction. As the demand for transparent and inclusive workplaces\nincreases, a solution that would allow us to more accurately measure our\nculture was on the top of our tech wish list \u2026 I think it\u2019s easy to identify a\nproblem and find a quick tech solution to use as a Band-Aid and hope it works.\nBut HR is a people-first industry and we must be strategic with the tech\nsolutions we invest in \u2026 My wish for this one-stop solution was granted [in]\nDecember when we launched Pluto, a D&I platform that uses proprietary\nblockchain and privacy technology to help us continue to foster a safe and\ninclusive workplace \u2026 We\u2019re thrilled that this technology has provided a safe\nand personalized platform that delivers deep insights and allows us to engage\nwith our employees in a way that we couldn\u2019t before.\u201d\n\n\u2014Karen Niovitch Davis, partner and CHRO, Prosek Partners\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nEric Friedman\n\nEric Friedman is the Founder and CEO of [eSkill](http://www.eskill.com/), a\nglobal leader in skills testing and behavioral assessment solutions for\nemployers.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nIt is safe to say that technology is evolving and expanding at an exponential\nrate. This is what many are calling \u201cdigital Darwinism,\u201d a time where\ntechnology and society are changing faster than most businesses can naturally\nadapt.\n\nA 2018 [report](https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Digital-\nMastery-DTI-report_20180704_web.pdf) found that organizations that are highly\ninvested in digital transformation are more profitable and possess higher\nmarket valuations than those that do not. As the founder and CEO of a platform\nfor complete candidate skills and job fit assessment launched in 2003, I have\nwitnessed the rapid evolution of the pre-hire process thanks to technology.\n\nIt is no surprise that recruiters need to adapt quickly to the ever-evolving\nenvironment around them in order to succeed in today\u2019s tidal wave of digital\nprogress. While video interviews have been around for some time, recent\nadvancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and automation are able to\nstreamline and advance the hiring process even further, but not without\nintroducing some newfound risks and pitfalls.\n\n**Automation And Artificial Intelligence**\n\nThe advent of video calling as we know it, ushered in 10 years ago, provided\nrecruiters the ability to interview candidates remotely. Since its emergence,\nit has been embraced by top organizations. Just like with most technologies,\nadvancements have been made to video interviewing that can speed up the\nrecruitment process and rely on less human power to operate. One-way video\ninterviews, which firms like ours are increasingly making available, are a\nrelatively new method in which candidates do not see the interviewer; instead,\nthey simply record responses to preset questions at a time convenient for\nthem.\n\nNow, AI is emerging as the next potential digital revolution, automating the\ninterview process even further. Unilever\n[reportedly](https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/in-unilevers-radical-hiring-\nexperiment-resumes-are-out-algorithms-are-in) began using AI to detect facial\nexpressions during video interviews in 2016. Candidates record their one-way\nvideo interview, and AI measures their facial expressions to assess\npersonality traits, mood and even the honesty of their answers, vocabulary and\nquestion response speed. In April, IBM CEO Ginny Rometty\n[announced](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/03/ibm-ai-can-predict-\nwith-95-percent-accuracy-which-employees-will-quit.html) that AI had replaced\n30% of the company's HR staff. And although humans will always be needed in\nthe HR field, IBM believes that eventually, machines/AI will help HR\nprofessionals and managers better do their work to drive improved employee\nexperiences and decision-making.\n\nAs a word of caution, for both accuracy and legal compliance, it is still\ncritical to make sure any AI used for scoring has scientific backing to prove\nthat scoring correlates with job performance. It\u2019s an even better step to test\nthe AI on your own employees to see if AI interview scoring correlates with\nperformance within the most relevant population \u2014 your actual staff.\n\n**Talent Is Everywhere**\n\nWhereas hiring was once limited geographically due to the high cost of flying\nin candidates for face-to-face interviews, today, candidates can be properly\nvetted no matter where they are located and in large numbers, thanks to the\nspeed of automation and AI. This can increase the talent pool infinitely. Not\nonly are companies able to recruit from locations they would not have\npreviously, but they are able to do so faster and more efficiently than\ntraditional interviewing processes would allow. The speed of analysis afforded\nby being able to review candidate interviews at any time and anywhere is\nrevolutionizing the hiring process.\n\n**Improve The Candidate Experience**\n\nJob seekers value video interviews, too: Nearly\n[62%](https://www.shrm.org/LearningAndCareer/learning/educational-program-\nmaterials/Documents/ICIMS_The%20Candidate%20Experience%20Playbook.pdf) of\ncandidates believe video technology gives them a competitive edge.\nPrioritizing the candidate experience is critical to attracting top talent in\na tight labor market. The 2018 Talent Board [_\u201cN_ _orth American Candidate\nExperience Benchmark Research Repor_ _t\u201d_](https://www.thetalentboard.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/02/2018_Talent-Board-NA-CandE-Research-\nReport_FINAL_2619.pdf) found that organizations that created a positive\ncandidate experience were more likely to reduce their cost per hire and time\nto hire. Maintaining a competitive edge throughout the recruitment process is\nvital to cost-efficiently securing talent in a tight job market.\n\n**The Downside Of Dehumanizing The Process**\n\nAlthough job seekers do find value in video technology, some see this as yet\nanother hurdle to jump over before ever have the opportunity to speak live\nwith a person. This obstacle may prevent qualified candidates from moving on\nin the interview process, resulting in a smaller candidate pool. Others who\nproceed with the one-way interview may be uncomfortable speaking to a\n\u201cmachine,\u201d ultimately negatively impacting their performance. Since candidates\nare not able to actually interact with a hiring manager, there is not a chance\nfor either party to ask clarifying questions, leading to possible\nmisinterpretations.\n\nGiven the risks of dehumanizing the interview process, it is important for\nrecruiters to take steps to mitigate the negative impact by maintaining open\ncommunication throughout the process, following up quickly once candidates\ncomplete interviews and creating opportunities that encourage candidates to\nprovide feedback.\n\n**The Risk Of Bias**\n\nCompanies may be hesitant to utilize video interviews due to the ability to\nsee the candidate in the early stages of the recruitment process, which could\nlead to unconscious or conscious bias. Therefore, recruiters must specifically\ndefine the relevant job competencies, behaviors and attributes that are\nrequired in each role. Candidates must be specifically rated against these\nrequirements to prevent video interviews from being susceptible to bias.\n\nThe ability to monitor when recruiters end their viewing of individual video\ninterviews will help to shed light on biases. For instance, if male video\ninterviews are being watched to completion 85% of the time and female video\ninterviews are being watched to completion only 46% of the time, it is\npossible to prove the recruiter is biased and needs to be retrained or\nreplaced. Maintaining a data-driven approach in all aspects of recruiting is\nbecoming more essential, and fortunately easier to monitor as technology\ncontinues to advance.\n\nIn an era of digital transformation, it is wise to heed the advice of Jack\nWelch: \u201cChange before you have to,\u201d and prepare your business for the future\nnow.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Eric Friedman](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2019/07/ericfriedman_avatar_1563822669-400x400.jpeg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/ericfriedman/\n\"Photo of Eric Friedman\")\n\n[Eric\nFriedman](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/ericfriedman/)\n\nEric Friedman is the Founder and CEO of [eSkill](http://www.eskill.com), a\nglobal leader in skills testing and behavioral assessment solutions for\nemployers.\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Eric Friedman&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: What Video, Artificial Intelligence And Automation Mean For The Future Of Recruiting %0A Author: Eric Friedman %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2019/10/17/what-video-artificial-intelligence-and-automation-mean-for-the-future-of-recruiting/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

Thousands of employers, training\norganizations, associations, certification programs, and workforce development\ninitiatives use Credly to help individuals translate their learning\nexperiences into professional opportunities using trusted, portable, digital\ncredentials.\n\nThis empowers organizations to attract, engage, develop, and retain talent\nwith the data-driven insights provided by Credly addressing skills gaps and\nhighlighting opportunities.\n\nThe business was founded in 2012 by CEO Jonathan Finkelstein, who had\npreviously co-founded two other companies in the workforce and learning space,\nLearningTimes and HorizonLive, which was acquired by Blackboard in 2010.\nCredly was a natural evolution of that work.\n\n\u201cFor the first four years, we grew the old-fashioned way, by making products\ncustomers love, saw value in and were willing to pay for,\u201d says Finkelstein.\n\u201cThen, in 2016, the movement we helped create started to become mainstream,\nand we brought on a group of partners as investors to accelerate our growth\nand fulfill demand.\u201d\n\nCredly has raised $20 million to date from investors that include leading\nsocial impact and venture firms, large public companies, strategic partners,\nand non-profit organizations.\n\n**Appraisd**\n\nPerformance management system [Appraisd](https://www.appraisd.com/\n\"https://www.appraisd.com/\") helps organizations move from single annual\nappraisals to a continuous performance discussion with a simple, employee-\nfirst interface.\n\nIts strength lies in its ability to fit in with the organization's own culture\nand way of doing things. It empowers employees to give and receive feedback on\ntheir own terms, set up regular check-ins with their line manager, manage\ntheir goals and develop their career plan.\n\nAppraisd was founded by Roly Walter in his spider-infested garden shed. He had\nstarted his career as a business analyst at Goldman Sachs designing global\nonline HR tools, and it was that experience that inspired him to design and\nlaunch Appraisd, which now has hundreds of customers all over the world. And\nthey've moved out of the shed.\n\nLaunched in 2012, to date Appraisd has had no external investment or funding.\n\n**EnterpriseAlumni**\n\nPowering the alumni networks of some of the world\u2019s largest companies,\n[EnterpriseAlumni ](https://enterprisealumni.com/\n\"https://enterprisealumni.com/\")helps them leverage this vast untapped pool of\npeople as a source of high-quality recruitment, sales, marketing and\ncommunity. Customers include Nestle, P&G and HSBC.\n\nThe business was founded by siblings James and Emma Sinclair. \u201cWe are proud to\nbe the only software company in the world who have gender balanced investors\nat scale: our cap table is 50/50 men and women,\u201d says James Sinclair.\n\nTotal investment to date is $15 million from top venture funds, including the\ntop three European-based VCs and strategic investors, such as Mike Ettling,\noutgoing President of SAP SuccessFactors, and Lord Mervyn Davies, co-author of\nthe UK Government\u2019s report on gender equality on boards.\n\nThis year EnterpriseAlumni was labelled \u2018a very important technology\u2019 by\nDeloitte/Josh Bersin in the HR Tech Disruption Report Deloitte\n\n**TravelTime platform**\n\nPeople think and plan their travel based on time rather than distance, and\nthat\u2019s important when it comes to the daily commute to work. Using real-time\ntravel data, the [TravelTime ](https://www.traveltimeplatform.com/\n\"https://www.traveltimeplatform.com/\")platform is an API and analytics tool\nthat lets users search location data using minutes rather than miles, and is\nproving valuable to the recruitment sector.\n\nBy showing job listings reachable to candidates in a maximum commute time of,\nfor example, 30 minutes, rather than a distance of 10 miles, it helps job\nsites deliver the most relevant search results for job seekers and recruiters.\n\nFounded by Charlie Davies, the current CEO, and Peter Lilley, the platform in\nits current form using location-based analytics was launched in 2013. Clients\ninclude Jobsite, as well as other sectors where search is an important part of\nthe process, such as Rightmove and Zoopla.\n\nLast May iGeolise, the creators of the TravelTime platform, announced a \u00a33.2\nmillion ($4.1 million) funding from ETF Partners.\n\n**Intrro**\n\nEmployee referrals are one of the most effective ways of hiring new people, as\nthey tend to get hired faster and stay in their jobs for longer.\n[Intrro](https://www.intrro.com/ \"https://www.intrro.com/\") makes it easier\nfor companies to connect with qualified candidates in their employee\u2019s social\nand professional networks. The employee referral platform uses machine\nlearning to automatically match the relevant talent to open positions,\nenabling employees to reach out to their contacts to let them know about the\njob opening.\n\nInstead of getting another unsolicited recruiting message from a stranger,\nrelevant candidates receive a personalized message from their contact. If they\nare interested they can directly respond to the recruiter, who can take it\nfrom there.\n\nIntrro also enables recruiters to browse their employee's contacts against\nopen positions, and proactively ask for an intro, allowing them to spend more\ntime speaking to receptive candidates and less time chasing leads, whilst\ngiving hiring managers access to a broader, verified and more diverse pool of\ntalent.\n\nFounded by Neel Jamie Shah and Nasser Oudjidane in 2018, the company has\nsecured $500,000 from a range of investors, including 500 Startups, Spartech\nVentures, plus strategic angel investors such as Saif Kidwai, founder of\nDigital Gurus, a specialist recruitment technology consultancy.\n\n**Personio**\n\nHeadquartered in Munich, Germany, [Personio](https://www.personio.com/\n\"https://www.personio.com/\") is a HR, recruiting and payroll platform that is\nalready digitising the HR departments of almost 2,000 SME customers in more\nthan 40 countries.\n\nFounded in 2015 by CEO Hanno Renner, Roman Schumacher, Arseniy Vershinin and\nIgnaz Forstmeier, the company recently expanded into in the U.K.\n\nThe innovative SaaS solution combines HR core features in one digital tool,\nenabling HR managers and business leaders to manage things like attendance\ndata, absences, and salaries consistently.\n\nPersonio recently announced its latest series C funding round of $75 million,\nbringing the total investment secured to $130 million.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@alisonbcoleman) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alisoncolemanfreelance/).

More than 100\nemployers now use the system, including\n[Hilton](https://jobs.hilton.com/select-country.php) and\n[Unilever](https://www.unilever.com/careers/), and more than a million job\nseekers have been analyzed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut some AI researchers argue the system is digital snake oil \u2014 an unfounded\nblend of superficial measurements and arbitrary number-crunching that is not\nrooted in scientific fact. Analyzing a human being like this, they argue,\ncould end up penalizing nonnative speakers, visibly nervous interviewees or\nanyone else who doesn\u2019t fit the model for look and speech.\n\nThe system, they argue, will assume a critical role in helping decide a\nperson\u2019s career. But they doubt it even knows what it\u2019s looking for: Just what\ndoes the perfect employee look and sound like, anyway?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a profoundly disturbing development that we have proprietary technology\nthat claims to differentiate between a productive worker and a worker who\nisn\u2019t fit, based on their facial movements, their tone of voice, their\nmannerisms,\u201d said Meredith Whittaker, a co-founder of the [AI Now\nInstitute](https://ainowinstitute.org/), a research center in New York.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pseudoscience. It\u2019s a license to discriminate,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd the\npeople whose lives and opportunities are literally being shaped by these\nsystems don\u2019t have any chance to weigh in.\u201d\n\n[Update: Prominent rights group files federal complaint against AI-hiring firm\nHireVue, citing \u201cunfair and deceptive\u201d\npractices](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/06/prominent-\nrights-group-files-federal-complaint-against-ai-hiring-firm-hirevue-citing-\nunfair-deceptive-\npractices/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_13&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_13)\n\nLoren Larsen, HireVue\u2019s chief technology officer, said that such criticism is\nuninformed and that \u201cmost AI researchers have a limited understanding\u201d of the\npsychology behind how workers think and behave.\n\nLarsen compared algorithms\u2019 ability to boost hiring outcomes with medicine\u2019s\nimprovement of health outcomes and said the science backed him up. The system,\nhe argued, is still more objective than the flawed metrics used by human\nrecruiters, whose thinking he called the \u201cultimate black box.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople are rejected all the time based on how they look, their shoes, how\nthey tucked in their shirts and how \u2018hot\u2019 they are,\u201d he told The Washington\nPost. \u201cAlgorithms eliminate most of that in a way that hasn\u2019t been possible\nbefore.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe AI, he said, doesn\u2019t explain its decisions or give candidates their\nassessment scores, which he called \u201cnot relevant.\u201d But it is \u201cnot logical,\u201d he\nsaid, to assume some people might be unfairly eliminated by the automated\njudge.\n\n\u201cWhen 1,000 people apply for one job,\u201d he said, \u201c999 people are going to get\nrejected, whether a company uses AI or not.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a prominent rights group, the Electronic Privacy Information\nCenter, filed an [official\ncomplaint](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/06/prominent-\nrights-group-files-federal-complaint-against-ai-hiring-firm-hirevue-citing-\nunfair-deceptive-practices/?tid=lk_inline_manual_21&itid=lk_inline_manual_21)\nurging the Federal Trade Commission to investigate HireVue for \u201cunfair and\ndeceptive\u201d practices. The system\u2019s \u201cbiased, unprovable and not replicable\"\nresults, EPIC officials wrote, constitute a major threat to American workers\u2019\nprivacy and livelihoods.\n\nAD\n\n[Listen on Post Reports: Reporters Drew Harwell and Carolyn Y. Johnson on the\nrise of AI and the risks of bias that come with\nit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/podcasts/post-reports/an-interview-with-an-\nalgorithm/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_23&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_23)\n\nThe inscrutable algorithms have forced job seekers to confront a new kind of\ninterview anxiety. Nicolette Vartuli, a University of Connecticut senior\nstudying math and economics with a 3.5 GPA, said she researched HireVue and\ndid her best to dazzle the job-interview machine. She answered confidently and\nin the time allotted. She used positive keywords. She smiled, often and wide.\n\nAD\n\nBut when she didn\u2019t get the investment banking job, she couldn\u2019t see how the\ncomputer had rated her or ask how she could improve, and she agonized over\nwhat she had missed. Had she not looked friendly enough? Did she talk too\nloudly? What did the AI hiring system believe she had gotten wrong?\n\n\u201cI feel like that\u2019s maybe one of the reasons I didn\u2019t get it: I spoke a little\ntoo naturally,\u201d Vartuli said. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t use enough big, fancy words. I\nused \u2018conglomerate\u2019 one time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHireVue said its system dissects the tiniest details of candidates\u2019 responses\n\u2014 their facial expressions, their eye contact and perceived \u201centhusiasm\u201d \u2014 and\ncompiles reports companies can use in deciding whom to hire or disregard.\n\nJob candidates aren\u2019t told their score or what little things they got wrong,\nand they can\u2019t ask the machine what they could do better. Human hiring\nmanagers can use other factors, beyond the HireVue score, to decide which\ncandidates pass the first-round test.\n\nAD\n\nThe system, HireVue said, employs superhuman precision and impartiality to\nzero in on an ideal employee, picking up on telltale clues a recruiter might\nmiss.\n\nMajor employers with lots of high-volume, entry-level openings are\nincreasingly turning to such automated systems to help find candidates, assess\nr\u00e9sum\u00e9s and streamline hiring. The Silicon Valley start-up AllyO, for\ninstance, advertises a \u201crecruiting automation bot\u201d that can text-message a\ncandidate, \u201cAre you willing to relocate?\u201d And a HireVue competitor, the\n\u201cdigital recruiter\u201d VCV, offers a similar system for use in phone interviews,\nduring which a candidate\u2019s voice and answers are analyzed by an \u201cautomated\nscreening\u201d machine.\n\nAD\n\nBut HireVue\u2019s prospects have cemented it as the leading player in the brave\nnew world of semi-automated corporate recruiting. It says it can save\nemployers a fortune on in-person interviews and quickly cull applicants deemed\nsubpar. HireVue says it also allows companies to see candidates from an\nexpanded hiring pool: Anyone with a phone and Internet connection can apply.\n\nAD\n\nNathan Mondragon, HireVue\u2019s chief industrial-organizational psychologist, told\nThe Post the standard 30-minute HireVue assessment includes half a dozen\nquestions but can yield up to 500,000 data points, all of which become\ningredients in the person\u2019s calculated score.\n\nThe employer decides the written questions, which HireVue\u2019s system then shows\nthe candidate while recording and analyzing their responses. The AI assesses\nhow a person\u2019s face moves to determine, for instance, how excited someone\nseems about a certain work task or how they would behave around angry\ncustomers. Those \u201cFacial Action Units,\u201d Mondragon said, can make up 29 percent\nof a person\u2019s score; the words they say and the \u201caudio features\u201d of their\nvoice, like their tone, make up the rest.\n\nAD\n\n[Wanted: The \u2018perfect babysitter.\u2019 Must pass AI scan for respect and\nattitude.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/16/wanted-\nperfect-babysitter-must-pass-ai-scan-respect-\nattitude/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_41&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_41)\n\n\u201cHumans are inconsistent by nature. They inject their subjectivity into the\nevaluations,\u201d Mondragon said. \u201cBut AI can database what the human processes in\nan interview, without bias. \u2026 And humans are now believing in machine\ndecisions over human feedback.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTo train the system on what to look for and tailor the test to a specific job,\nthe employer\u2019s current workers filling the same job \u2014 \u201cthe entire spectrum,\nfrom high to low achievers\u201d \u2014 sit through the AI assessment, Larsen said.\n\nTheir responses, Larsen said, are then matched with a \u201cbenchmark of success\u201d\nfrom those workers\u2019 past job performance, like how well they had met their\nsales quotas and how quickly they had resolved customer calls. The best\ncandidates, in other words, end up looking and sounding like the employees who\nhad done well before the prospective hires had even applied.\n\nAD\n\nAfter a new candidate takes the HireVue test, the system generates a report\ncard on their \u201ccompetencies and behaviors,\u201d including their \u201cwillingness to\nlearn,\u201d \u201cconscientiousness & responsibility\u201d and \u201cpersonal stability,\u201d the\nlatter of which is defined by how well they can cope with \u201cirritable customers\nor co-workers.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThose computer-estimated personality traits are then used to group candidates\ninto high, medium and low tiers based on their \u201clikelihood of success.\u201d\nEmployers can still pursue candidates ranked in the bottom tier, but several\ninterviewed by The Post said they mostly focused on the ones the computer\nsystem liked best.\n\n[The new way your boss can tell if you\u2019re about to quit your\njob](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/04/11/new-way-your-boss-can-\ntell-if-youre-about-quit-your-\njob/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_50&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_50)\n\nHireVue offers only the most limited peek into its interview algorithms, both\nto protect its trade secrets and because the company doesn\u2019t always know how\nthe system decides on who gets labeled a \u201cfuture top performer.\u201d\n\nThe company has given only vague explanations when defining which words or\nbehaviors offer the best results. For a call center job, the company says,\n\u201csupportive\u201d words might be encouraged, while \u201caggressive\u201d ones might sink\none\u2019s score.\n\nHireVue said its board of expert advisers regularly reviews its algorithmic\napproach, but the company declined to make the system available for an\nindependent audit. The company, Larsen said, is \u201cexploring the use of an\nindependent auditor right now, to see how that could work.\u201d\n\nHireVue launched its AI assessment service in 2014 as an add-on to its video-\ninterview software, which more than 700 companies have used for nearly 12\nmillion interviews worldwide. The Utah-based company won\u2019t disclose its\nrevenue, the cost for employers or a full list of clients.\n\nThe company said last month that the private-equity giant [Carlyle\nGroup](https://www.carlyle.com/) would become its new majority investor,\nproviding an undisclosed sum from an $18.5 billion fund. Patrick McCarter, a\nmanaging director at the investment firm \u2014 which uses HireVue\u2019s video\ninterviews internally and said it \u201cwill look to deploy AI-driven candidate\nassessments over time\u201d \u2014 said the money would help the company expand to more\nemployers and more specialized job openings, both in the United States and\naround the world.\n\nAt the hotel giant Hilton International, thousands of applicants for\nreservation-booking, revenue management and call center positions have gone\nthrough HireVue\u2019s AI system, and executives credit the automated interviews\nwith shrinking their average hiring time from six weeks to five days.\n\nSarah Smart, the company\u2019s vice president of global recruitment, said the\nsystem has radically redrawn Hilton\u2019s hiring rituals, allowing the company to\nchurn through applicants at lightning speed. Hiring managers inundated with\napplicants can now just look at who the system ranked highly and filter out\nthe rest: \u201cIt\u2019s rare for a recruiter to need to go out of that range,\u201d she\nsaid.\n\nAt the consumer goods conglomerate Unilever, HireVue is credited with helping\nsave 100,000 hours of interviewing time and roughly $1 million in recruiting\ncosts a year. Leena Nair, the company\u2019s chief human resource officer, said the\nsystem had also helped steer managers away from hiring only \u201cmini-mes\u201d who\nlook and act just like them, boosting the company\u2019s \u201cdiversity hires,\u201d as she\ncalled them, by about 16 percent.\n\n\u201cThe more digital we become, the more human we become,\u201d she added.\n\nDane E. Holmes, the global head of human-capital management at HireVue client\nGoldman Sachs, [wrote](https://hbr.org/2019/05/recruiting) in the Harvard\nBusiness Review this spring that the banking giant\u2019s roughly 50,000 video-\ninterview recordings were \u201ca treasure trove of data that will help us conduct\ninsightful analyses.\"\n\nThe investment bank said it uses HireVue\u2019s video-interview system but not its\ncomputer-generated assessments. But Holmes said data from those videos could\nhelp the company figure out how candidates\u2019 skills and backgrounds might\ncorrespond to how well they would work or how long they would stay at the\nfirm. The company, he added, is also \u201cexperimenting with r\u00e9sum\u00e9-reading\nalgorithms\u201d that would help decide new hires\u2019 departments and tasks.\n\n\u201cCan I imagine a future in which companies rely exclusively on machines and\nalgorithms to rate r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and interviews? Maybe, for some,\u201d he wrote. (The\n\u201chuman element\u201d of recruiting, he pledged, would survive at Goldman Sachs.)\n\n[Is your pregnancy app sharing your intimate data with your\nboss?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/10/tracking-your-\npregnancy-an-app-may-be-more-public-than-you-\nthink/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_63&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_63)\n\nHireVue\u2019s expansion has also helped it win business from smaller groups such\nas [Re:work](https://www.reworktraining.org/), a Chicago nonprofit\norganization that trains unemployed local job seekers for careers in the tech\nindustry. Shelton Banks, the group\u2019s chief, said HireVue had proved to be an\nirreplaceable guide in assessing which candidates would be worth the effort.\n\nThe nonprofit organization once allowed almost anyone into its intensive\neight-week training program, but many burned out early. Now, every candidate\ngoes through the AI assessment first, which ranks them on problem-solving and\nnegotiation skills and helps the group determine who might have the most\nmotivation, curiosity and grit.\n\n\u201cKnowing where that person is at a starting place, when it comes to this\nperson\u2019s life,\u201d Banks said, \u201ccan help us make more accurate assessments of the\npeople we\u2019re saying yes or no to.\u201d\n\nBut Lisa Feldman Barrett, a neuroscientist who studies emotion, said she is\n\u201cstrongly skeptical\u201d that the system can really comprehend what it\u2019s looking\nat. She recently led a team of four senior scientists, including an expert in\n\u201ccomputer vision\u201d systems, in\n[assessing](https://journals.sagepub.com/stoken/default+domain/10.1177%2F1529100619832930-FREE/full)\nmore than 1,000 published research papers studying whether the human face\nshows universal expressions of emotion and how well algorithms can understand\nthem.\n\nThe systems, they found, have become quite perceptive at detecting facial\nmovements \u2014 spotting the difference, say, between a smile and a frown. But\nthey\u2019re still worryingly imprecise in understanding what those movements\nactually mean and woefully unprepared for the vast cultural and social\ndistinctions in how people show emotion or personality.\n\nLook at scowling, Barrett said: A computer might see a person\u2019s frown and\nfurrowed brow and assume they\u2019re easily angered \u2014 a red flag for someone\nseeking a sales associate job. But people scowl all the time, she said, \u201cwhen\nthey\u2019re not angry: when they\u2019re concentrating really hard, when they\u2019re\nconfused, when they have gas.\u201d\n\nLuke Stark, a researcher at Microsoft\u2019s research lab in Montreal studying\nemotion and AI \u2014 who spoke as an individual, not as a Microsoft employee \u2014 was\nsimilarly skeptical of HireVue\u2019s ability to predict a worker\u2019s personality\nfrom their intonations and turns of phrase.\n\n[What happens when an algorithm labels you as mentally\nill?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/09/04/mental-\nhealth/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_71&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_71)\n\nSystems like HireVue, he said, have become quite skilled at spitting out data\npoints that seem convincing, even when they\u2019re not backed by science. And he\nfinds this \u201ccharisma of numbers\u201d really troubling because of the\noverconfidence employers might lend them while seeking to decide the path of\napplicants\u2019 careers.\n\nThe best AI systems today, he said, are notoriously prone to misunderstanding\nmeaning and intent. But he worried that even their perceived success at\ndivining a person\u2019s true worth could help perpetuate a \u201chomogenous\u201d corporate\nmonoculture of automatons, each new hire modeled after the last.\n\nThe company, HireVue\u2019s Larsen said, audits its performance data to look for\npotentially discriminatory hiring practices, known as adverse impacts, using\n\u201cworld-class bias testing\u201d techniques. The company\u2019s algorithms, he added,\nhave been trained \u201cusing the most deep and diverse data set of facial action\nunits available, which includes people from many countries and cultures.\u201d\n\nHireVue\u2019s growth, however, is running into some regulatory snags. In August,\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) signed [a first-in-the-nation\nlaw](http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/fulltext.asp?Name=101-0260)\nthat will force employers to tell job applicants how their AI-hiring system\nworks and get their consent before running them through the test. The measure,\nwhich HireVue said it supports, will take effect Jan. 1.\n\nState Rep. Jaime Andrade Jr. (D), who co-sponsored the bill, said he pushed\nthe transparency law after learning how many job applicants were rejected at\nthe AI stage of a job interview. He worried that spoken accents or cultural\ndifferences could end up improperly warping the results, and that people who\ndeclined to sit for the assessment could be unfairly punished by not being\nconsidered for the job.\n\n\u201cWhat is the model employee? Is it a white guy? A white woman? Someone who\nsmiles a lot?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are the data points being used? There has to be\nsome explanation, and there has to be consent.\u201d\n\n[As summer camps turn on facial recognition, parents demand: More smiles,\nplease](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/08/summer-camps-\nturn-facial-recognition-parents-demand-more-smiles-\nplease/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_78&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_78)\n\nHireVue cautions candidates that there is no way to trick, cheat or hack the\nsystem, because it assesses tens of thousands of factors to assess a \u201cunique\nset of personal competencies.\u201d \u201cDo what feels most natural to you,\u201d the\ncompany says in an online [guide](https://www.hirevue.com/blog/how-to-prepare-\nfor-your-hirevue-assessment).\n\nBut roughly a dozen interviewees who have taken the AI test \u2014 including some\nwho got the job \u2014 told The Post it felt alienating and dehumanizing to have to\nwow a computer before being deemed worthy of a company\u2019s time.\n\nThey questioned what would be done with the video afterward and said they felt\nuneasy about having to perform to unexplained AI demands. Several said they\nrefused to do the interview outright because, in the words of one candidate,\nthe idea \u201cmade my skin crawl.\u201d\n\nCandidates said they have scrambled for ideas on how to maximize their\nworthiness before the algorithm\u2019s eye, turning to the hundreds of videos and\nonline handbooks suggesting, for instance, that they sit in front of a clean\nwhite wall, lest the background clutter dock their grade. \u201cGlue some googly\neyes to your webcam. It\u2019ll make it easier to maintain eye contact,\u201d one user\non the message board Reddit suggested.\n\nStark, the AI researcher, said these \u201cfolk theories of algorithms\u201d were a\nnatural response from people facing impenetrable AI systems with the power to\ndecide their fate. The survival techniques could feel reassuring, he said,\neven if they were wrong: Pick the right words, use the right tone, put on a\nsufficiently happy face. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of trying to give people confronting an\nopaque system they don\u2019t understand some feeling of agency,\u201d he said.\n\nBut some HireVue interviewees questioned whether it was fair or even smart to\njudge a person\u2019s workplace performance or personal abilities based on half an\nhour spent looking into a webcam. They also worried that people\u2019s nerves about\nthe odd nature of the exam might end up disqualifying them outright.\n\n[Oregon became a testing ground for Amazon\u2019s facial-recognition policing. But\nwhat if Rekognition gets it\nwrong?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/30/amazons-facial-\nrecognition-technology-is-supercharging-local-\npolice/?tid=lk_interstitial_manual_85&itid=lk_interstitial_manual_85)\n\nEmma Rasiel, an economics professor at Duke University who regularly advises\nstudents seeking jobs on Wall Street, said she has seen a growing number of\nstudents excessively unsettled about their upcoming HireVue test. The\nuniversity\u2019s economics department now offers a\n[guide](https://econ.duke.edu/sites/econ.duke.edu/files/file-\nattachments/Typical%20Questions%20from%20HireVue%20Interviews.pdf) to HireVue\ninterviews on its student resources\n[website](https://econ.duke.edu/dfe/student-resources), including typical\nquestions (\u201cWhat does integrity mean to you?\u201d) and behavioral tips (\u201cAct\nnatural, talk slowly!\u201d).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a new and untried way of communicating who they are that it adds to\ntheir anxiety,\u201d Rasiel said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an anxious generation, and now we\u2019re\nasking them to talk to a computer screen, answering questions to a camera \u2026\nwith no real guidelines on how to make themselves look better or worse.\u201d\n\nThe mysterious demands can also push people\u2019s angst into overdrive. When\nSheikh Ahmed, a 25-year-old in Queens, applied for teller jobs at banks around\nNew York, he said he received eight HireVue assessment offers, all scheduled\nfor the same day.\n\nHe studied guides on how to talk and act but found the hardest part was\nfiguring out the camera angle: Too high, he worried, and he would look\ndomineering; too low, and he would look shrunken and weak.\n\nBefore his marathon of AI interviews, he put on a crisp dress shirt, a tie and\npajama pants and went to his dad\u2019s soundproof music studio, away from the\nfamily\u2019s chirping society finch. He also turned off his air conditioning\nsystem, hoping the background noise wouldn\u2019t mess up his score.\n\nHe changed his answers slightly in each interview, in the hopes that the\nalgorithm would find something it liked. But he found it exhausting and\ndisheartening to boil down his life experience and worthiness into a computer-\nfriendly sound bite.\n\nBy the end, his mouth was dry, he was covered in sweat and he was paranoid he\nhadn\u2019t made enough eye contact while worrying about the bird. A few weeks\nafter the interviews, he said, he\u2019s still waiting to hear whether he got a\njob.\n\n _Correction: Due to incorrect information from Goldman Sachs, The Post\nmisreported in an earlier version of this story that the investment bank used\nHireVue\u2019s AI-driven assessment program. Goldman Sachs representatives said\nthey only use HireVue\u2019s video-interview system, not its automated\nassessments._\n\n0 Comments\n\n### Coronavirus Updates\n\nFollow the latest on the outbreak with our newsletter every weekday.

We need to give people\na reason to work for us and a reason to stay.\n\nIs technology the answer? As we continue to try and harness tech to\nsupercharge our own capabilities, do we understand what we\u2019re doing? We will,\nbut it\u2019s a work in progress: we grasped the mystery of the Cloud and are\nlearning all about AI and automation. What\u2019s the best strategy? Overall, I\u2019d\nsay it\u2019s to keep our North Star: the who, what, when, where, why and how of\ncreating a phenomenal workforce is all about people. That means we need to\nwork on both candidate and employee experiences \u2014 on ways to source, hire,\nengage and retain. Here\u2019s how:\n\n**Recruiting**\n\nEverything recruiters do needs to be accelerated and intensified. We\u2019re going\nto be leaning on **super-recruiters** \u2014 part sourcer, part marketer and part\ntechnologist, who embrace the power of data, and use it to forge strategic\ndecisions based on the reach of automation and the depth of analysis.\nAccording to the Harvard Business Review, an [analysis\n](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/98/6/1060/)of 17 studies of applicant\nevaluations shows that a simple equation [outperforms human decisions by at\nleast 25%](https://hbr.org/2014/05/in-hiring-algorithms-beat-instinct). With\nthis approach to recruiting we may be able to actually conquer bias, at least\nmore than we have already.\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\nThe shortage of workers is going to make employers look out of the box to\ncreate **deeper talent pools** based on different criteria: the potential for\ngrowth will be more important than the potential for filling a static role. To\nmine deeper talent pools means we\u2019ll need a digital rolodex with a farther\nreach \u2014 to former employees who may wind up boomerang hires, job candidates\nwho show promise but made didn\u2019t make the initial cut, and talent with the\nsoft skills we need to pay attention to, like dependability, strong\ncommunication skills, organization, adaptability and leadership, even if their\nexperience didn\u2019t match the job description.\n\nWe\u2019ll be breaking open the model of the workplace: instead of having everyone\nin one place, they\u2019ll be all over the place. **** To get the best talent,\nemployers will offer positions that are **remote and flexible.** We need to\nhire people who are willing to work but is it vital that they\u2019re willing to\ncome into the office? Many of us are already relying on teams of great remote\ntalent. Flexibility is a key factor in work-life integration, so offering it\nis speaking to the true needs of talent now. In a competitive job market, this\nnew model will be especially necessary to attract Gen Z, who will comprise\n[36% of the global workforce](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/01/61-million-gen-\nzers-about-to-enter-us-workforce-and-change-it.html) by 2020. Being digital\nnatives who grew up in an internet-centric society, the members of this\ngeneration expect remote and flexible working arrangements.  \n\n**Hiring**\n\nTo keep a great hire engaged, it\u2019s simple: provide a standout experience. Come\n2020, make sure your **culture** holds up to scrutiny, clarifies expectations\nand embraces employee goals. Make sure employees understand not only the\nexpectations regarding tasks, but also the behaviors expected, and make sure\nyour managers are on board with fostering employee and team growth. This may\nbe the year we no longer have to make a business case for engagement, but\nhere\u2019s a reminder: highly engaged employees are [21% more\nproductive](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/163130/employee-engagement-\ndrives-growth.aspx). [Seventy-three percent of disengaged\nemployees](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/204248/star-employees-\nslipping-away.aspx) are actively looking for jobs, compared with 37% of\nengaged employees. When it comes to workplace culture, there\u2019s no in-between;\nit\u2019s either a lose/lose or a win/win.\n\nGlassdoor\u2019s [Diversity & Inclusion Study 2019](https://talentculture.us6.list-\nmanage.com/track/click?u=59410903cd3e6cd75398f8573&id=cac6d6cc87&e=3cc7e4cb65)\nfound that 49% of employed adults in the U.S, U.K, France, and Germany have\nwitnessed or experienced some form of discrimination in the workplace. 2020\nneeds to be the year employers really commit to **inclusivity** and\n**diversity**. It should begin at the top: by educating leaders and managers,\nand _should_ include a commitment to diverse hiring practices, listening to\nemployees, and making a workspace physically accessible and ADA compliant. In\nother words, it\u2019s time to walk the walk.\n\nThe **onboarding** experience is a key differentiator in how employees\nperceive a company, engage with the job, and stay involved (or not) with your\nbusiness objectives. In 2020 we need to consider onboarding and the Day One\nexperience as either a make or a break regarding bit just engagement but long-\nterm retention. First lessons and impressions made are critical in determining\nhow your hire feels about your organization. Offer onboarding that\u2019s flexible,\nfixable, accessible, self-guiding, and secure. We\u2019ll see more companies\nfinally replacing the herd-in-a-conference room approach with digital\ndevelopment platforms that measure, track, respond, personalize, and are\nsecure as well.\n\n**Tending**\n\nThen, **** let\u2019s work on **tending** our talent rather than managing it.\nPsychologists explain tending as intentional relationship-building that\nincreases a sense of community and wellbeing. [Harvard Business\nReview](https://hbr.org/2015/09/3-steps-to-giving-office-housework-its-proper-\ndue) notes that tending goes a long way in mitigating the \u201cworkers as\nmachines\u201d phenomenon common in certain industries. Further, it makes employees\n\u201csticky\u201d to an organization. We\u2019ll see organizations doing their best with\nthis \u2013 and I predict we\u2019ll also see clear results.\n\nWe\u2019ll also see forward-thinking organizations raising the bar on employee\n**wellness** offerings, including paternity, maternity, family and caregiver\nleave; medical and mental health benefits; fitness and adventure programs with\nrewards for hitting personal goals; and thankfully, an emphasis on financial\nwellness as we recognize the toll financial stress takes on employees.\nDaycare, education, eldercare, mobility \u2014 wellness means enabling our\nworkforce to function better in their daily lives. Companies would also be\nwise to ask their employees what they want and need, and try to use a benefits\nand wellness platform that offers flexibility and responds to the needs of\nfour or five generations working side by side.\n\nWhat else? How\u2019s your workspace? Are you staring at it right now? Today\u2019s\n**digital workspace** can be a hyper-siloed, apps-by-the-dozen experience: the\n[average\nemployee](https://www.citrix.com/content/dam/citrix/en_us/documents/white-\npaper/economic-impacts-flexible-working-us-2019.pdf) spends nearly 65% of any\ngiven workday on busywork and in meetings, 20% searching for information and\n15% doing what they want and are paid to do. 2020 should see a shift to a more\ncohesive workspace and seamless experience. A great **physical workspace** is\nequally important, and employers will continue to rethink the cubicle with\nopen spaces, a pet-friendly environment, and loads of in-office perks \u2014\nincluding spaces that resemble coworking spaces. The bottom line: it\u2019s not\nabout foosball, and it hasn\u2019t been about foosball in years.  \n\nFinally, focus on **growth**. 93% of employees would stay at a company longer\nif it invested in their careers according to LinkedIn\u2019s [Workforce Learning\nReport](https://learning.linkedin.com/elearning-solutions-guides/workplace-\nlearning-report-2018). Some firms are going to key employees\u2019 compensation\nplans to the growth and performance of the business, not just their personal\nrole/performance \u2014 and that may boost alignment, positive behavior and team\nculture all at once. From internship to management here must be a sense of\nupward movement \u2014 if they don\u2019t see a route forward they\u2019re find one outside\nyour doors. Don\u2019t stop at onboarding when it comes to training and coaching.\nConsider ongoing, self-service, on-demand learning opportunities. That sense\nof the future should never stop.\n\n2020 earmarks a new decade and undoubtedly it\u2019s going to surprise us. But\nlet\u2019s aim for good surprises \u2014 and that includes making our own employees\nhappy.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/MeghanMBiro).

Qpage sees this as an opportunity and wants to shake the market with\nits comprehensive solution.\n\n## Human Resource Management Technology\n\nThere are various methods for managing people management functions, each\nproposing a different type of solution. The three most common are the Human\nResources Information System (HRIS), Human Capital Management (HCM) and the\nApplicant Tracking System (ATS).\n\nThe HR information system is related to managing the day-to-day affairs of the\ncompany such as viewing staff profiles, requesting leave, uploading legal\ndocuments. The human capital management system is additionally offering the\nlist of employees' salaries. Process supervision for acquiring and hiring also\nhelps businesses manage staff appraisal performance management.\n\nThe applicant tracking system is a software application that enables the\nelectronic handling of recruitment, hiring automation, applicant scoring\nsystem, and on-boarding. An ATS can be implemented or accessed online at the\nenterprise- or small-business levels, depending on the needs of the\norganization; free and open-source ATS software is also available.\n\nSubscribe to TechRasa's mailing list\n\nCompanies, such as [Bamboohr](https://www.bamboohr.com/),\n[Gusto](https://gusto.com/), and [Paycor ](https://www.paycor.com/)are some of\nthe well-known software tools available in the field of HR. Applicant process\nmanagement also includes [SmartRecruiters](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/),\n[Workable ](https://www.workable.com/)and [Lever\n](https://www.lever.co/)software.\n\n## The Founders\n\n![](http://techrasa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/founders-1024x654.jpg)from\nleft to right, Aram Jafari, Pouya Lotfi, Farhad Jafari\n\n**[Pouya Lotfi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pouya-\nlotfi-70531236/?originalSubdomain=ee)** , the Co-founder and CEO of Qpage, was\nborn in 1984. He completed his undergraduate degree in Business Administration\nfrom the University of Tehran. He holds a Master\u2019s Degree in Business\nAdministration (MBA) Aalto School of business, Finland. Pouya has the\nexperience of working with companies such as LG Electronics as senior business\nUnit Manager, Entekhab Industrial Group as Business Unit Director, and Pars\nOnline as an entrepreneur in house. He also has startup experiences being a\nco-founder and CEO at Reyhoon.com, and held positions in Bamilo.com Iranian\nleading marketplace at the time as CEO and Chief Operating Officer at the same\ntime.\n\n**[Aram Jafari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aram-jafari-b1826655/)** is\nanother co-founder of [Qpage ](https://www.qpage.one/)who works in the field\nof artificial intelligence. He holds a Bachelor of Computer Software\nEngineering from the University of Science and Culture and a Master\u2019s Degree\nin Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations from Kharazmi University. He\nhas been dedicated to science and business analysis at Reyhoon, Bamilo, and\nSnapp companies.\n\n**[Farhad Jafari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farhad-jafari/)** , Chief\nDesigner of Qpage, is born in 1987. He is an undergraduate in computer\nsoftware engineering from Islamic Azad University. Farhad was a UX consultant\nat Yara, Mabna, and Netap, who also collaborates with DigiKala, Bamilo, Alonak\nand Mellat\u2019s Beh-Pardakht in the field of User Experience and product design.\n\n## The starting of the business\n\nThe idea for Qpage comes to Pouya\u2019s mind in March 2019, and he shares the idea\nwith Ali two months later. In May, he planned to migrate abroad to meet an\nangel investor. After agreeing with him, they start working with Ali and Aram\nand Farhad join them in June.\n\nThey initially locate their startup in the Tivan collaborative workspace and,\nafter a month, they rent a new office that currently houses a team of 16\npeople. After six months of operation, Qpage was released in January. Also,\nchoosing the name of Qpage comes from Quick Page module based SaaS.\n\n## Problems, inefficiencies, and outdated solutions\n\nIn Iran, HRM processes are performed manually and at best on spreadsheet\nsoftware such as Excel. For this reason, there is no integration between the\ndifferent parts of the process. To date, in Iran, only the part of recruitment\nsites has become online and have attracted the attention of businesses.\n\nExisting solutions for human resource management around the world are outdated\nand inappropriate for new business mechanisms. Workforce planning, job\ndescriptions, job posting, job searches, recruiting potential candidates,\ninterviewing, hiring, onboarding, and staff evaluation for HR and other staff\nis a very difficult process. Existing solutions do not meet the needs of\nbusinesses in all of these sectors.\n\nAlso, none of the solutions work automatically and are mostly used to solve\nproblems 5 years ago. For example, there is only one fixed and specific\nprocess for the hiring process that does not meet all the needs of businesses.\nIt also does not have a good user interface and artificial intelligence does\nnot interfere with their process automation.\n\nPlatforms are analyzed and evaluated by platforms through common behavioral\ntests that are partially responsive. The judgment of the interviewer is also\ninfluential in the judgment of individuals because there is no set standard\nand the individual acts according to his or her reasoning. Judgments should be\nbased on company standards, not personal standards.\n\nOne of the big problems for job seekers is completing different resumes in\ndifferent places. This causes frustration for the employer because of the lack\nof standard resumes. Also, after the end of the face-to-face interview, the\nbusiness usually does not announce the final response for various reasons.\n\nThough the applicant got no clue on what process and stages they are in, where\nit takes a hefty amount of efforts for recruiters to inform them all.\n\n## The solution is a comprehensive human resource management platform\n\nthe first step, Qpage has been able to cover all the recruitment steps and\nprocesses required for pre and post-hiring on an online platform. Meanwhile,\nall processes are flexible and businesses can customize it according to their\nflows. Qpage also integrates with recruitment sites, automating the process of\nhiring ads, receiving resumes, reviewing resumes and filtering them.\n\nThe Qpage \u200b\u200bplatform has been able to automate a large amount of demanding\ntasks with the help of artificial intelligence to reduce the workloads of HR\nand recruiting professionals. Besides, this platform is the canvas of the\ninterviewers with the help of artificial intelligence and data mining during\nthe interview and judge phase.\n\n### Resume with a single photo\n\nThis startup also helps job seekers to easily present their resume to\nemployers. It also automatically puts the employee in the hiring process and\nnotifies him/her of the final response after the business is finally declared.\n\n### Proposed Value, Human Resources Total System (HRTS)\n\nQpage is a solution to facilitate communication between the job-seeker,\nemployee, recruiter, and employer. Despite the platform\u2019s simplicity, it\nintegrates the hiring process for both the employer and the employer, so that\nthey don\u2019t get confused on different platforms. In other words, Qpage is a\ncomprehensive talent management system.\n\nPouya defines the value of the Qpage as follows:\n\n> We want to be a human resources management operating system for small and\n> medium-sized businesses. Also, as we simplify this area, we can get people\n> out of the dryness and lifelessness of recruitment processes and cut costs.\n\n## The product\n\nThe original product offered by Qpage is more capable than its external\ncompetitors, such as Lever, breezy Warehouse and even Workable. According to\nPouya:\n\n> We can't say we released the Minimum Acceptable Product (MVP); because this\n> version of Qpage is the Minimum sellable Product.\n\n## Workforce planning\n\nQpage helps businesses to easily embed their organizational charts into the\nplatform. They can then simply identify their vacancies at the time of hiring\nto decide on whether to recruit or not.\n\n![Organizational chart in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u0686\u0627\u0631\u062a-\u0633\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc-En-1024x522.jpg)Organizational chart\n\n## Job Description\n\nThere can be two types of writing job descriptions in Qpage. When intending to\nhire a regular position, only the three characteristics of the **position** ,\n**responsibilities** and **salary and benefits** are defined. In the advanced\ncase, adding to the aforementioned, the **required capabilities** ,\n**evaluation approach** and any other factors that are demanded by the\nbusiness will be defined in the platform.\n\n![Job description in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u0634\u0631\u062d-En-857x1024.jpg)Job description\n\n**Job description standardization** allows businesses to simply post their\nrecruitment ad across all recruitment sites by a single click. Businesses can\nalso publish a standard job description form on their social networks by\nconnecting them to Qpage.\n\n## Integration with recruitment sites and easy filtering\n\nDue to the definition of a standard online job description, candidates can be\neasily classified and filtered according to the organization\u2019s needs, and then\nbe interviewed in order of priority. If more information is required, the two\nparties can communicate with each other on the platform, in real-time.\n\n![categorizing and filtering the resume in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u0641\u06cc\u0644\u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u06af-\u0622\u0633\u0627\u0646-En-1024x517.jpg)categorizing and\nfiltering the resume\n\nPersonnel within the company who are eager for a job promotion or transfer\nwithin the organization can easily access job opportunities through the Qpage\nplatform. Managers in each department can also store potential candidates that\nthere is a possibility of future cooperation with to refer to them at the\nright time.\n\n### Qualification\n\nIn addition to **the scoring of job interviewers** , Qpage helps employers\nprocess fair scoring concerning candidate\u2019s resume and **personality,\nbehavioral and voice tests**. This reduces the effect of the interviewer's\npersonal feelings on the judgment of individuals. Finally, all the items\nlisted in the job-seekers profile are displayed to the final decision-maker.\n\n### Telephone, video and in-person interviews\n\nIn addition to a question-and-answer list for the initial review that is being\nsent to the job seeker, Qpage will be able to arrange telephone and in-person\ninterviews. This platform can also help in outsourcing the interview phase if\nneeded by businesses. In both cases, the job-seekers can receive points and\nthe interviewer's opinion is included in their interview form.\n\n![Flexible job interview process in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u062c\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646-\u0645\u0635\u0627\u062d\u0628\u0647-En-1024x465.jpg)Flexible job interview\nprocess\n\nIt is also possible to designate several people for the interview, in which\ncase the interviewer's rating and comments are recorded in the profile of each\njob-seeker. Emotional and behavioral analysis of the job with the help of\nartificial intelligence in the interview is also done by Qpage. That is, in\naddition to examining one's personality traits, one can test how judgment,\ndecision making, power of logic, tone of voice and so on are.\n\n![Selection of interviewer team in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u062a\u06cc\u0645-\u0627\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0627\u0645-En-1024x469.jpg)Selection of interviewer\nteam\n\n### The stages of organizational adoption\n\nThis platform helps new employees get to know their company within the first\n100 days of their work. That is, the department manager briefs the individual\non his / her **responsibilities** by identifying several specific tasks that\nultimately lead to the accomplishment of a **mission**. It also provides\nstatistics on the number of employees, the recruitment process, ongoing\ninterviews, employee leave, vacancies, and so on.\n\n![onboarding process in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062d\u0644-\u067e\u0630\u06cc\u0631\u0634-\u0633\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc-En-1024x430.jpg)onboarding process\n\nAfter completing each task, the designated individuals can rate the new\nemployee to determine their performance. Besides, if new employees need\nassistance, they can provide it through the platform and arrange in-person\nmeetings if needed.\n\n### In-company team building\n\nOrganization members can form different teams to communicate with each other.\nThis feature helps new employees find their place in the organization more\neasily and get to know people. It is also useful for the recruitment process\nthat requires multiple decision-makers.\n\n![In-company team building in Qpage](http://techrasa.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/\u062a\u06cc\u0645-\u0633\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646-En-1024x514.jpg)In-company team building\n\n### Online Resume\n\nTo prepare a resume, it is only necessary for the job-seeker to send a PDF of\nhis / her resume so that the Qpage can create a profile ready for him/her\nusing artificial intelligence. The accuracy of parsing and analyzing of the\nresumes is 85% in Qpage. After submitting the resume, the initial analysis\nwill be carried out on it and be sent to the eligible employers.\n\nThis feature helps Qpage to show the ratings and comments of all the\ninterviewers in the profile of the person so that the employer can make a\ncomfortable decision.\n\n### Income model, Freemium\n\nThe earnings model is Freemium. The features listed in the product section\nwill be provided for free and users will be paying a membership fee for\nadvanced tools and features that will be released in the future.\n\n### Market size, 500 million SMEs\n\nQpage\u2019s main customers are particularly medium and large businesses (SMEs) and\nstartups. The number of these businesses in the world is estimated at 500\nmillion. It is estimated that this market will reach $ 65 billion by the year\n2025.\n\n### Competitors and Partners\n\nPouya expresses his view on their global competitors in the following:\n\n> In the global marketplace, platforms like Workable and Lever are our main\n> competitors. With 15 years of experience, Workable has cooperated with 5,000\n> businesses and is valued at $ 700 million. The 15-year-old Workable has much\n> fewer features than the first version of the Qpage. Lever is our other\n> competitor. It has been operating for nearly eight years and has raised $ 75\n> million in the capital. Lever has only 20% of the benefits which the first\n> version of the Qpage offers.\n\nIn the Iranian market, platforms such as [Adilar ](https://adilar.com/)and\n[Civito ](https://civito.co/)are also competitors to Qpage.\n\nRecruitment sites are the most important business partner of this platform.\nQpage needs a large number of job-seekers to complete its hiring process.\nRecruitment sites like Glassdoor and [Linkedin ](https://www.linkedin.com/)can\nhelp this platform get access to job seekers\u2019 resumes.\n\n### Vision, solution for job-seeker, recruiter, employee and employer\nrelations\n\nPouya: \"If we can meet all the needs of the four segments of the job-seeker,\nrecruiter, employee, and employer and satisfy them, then the good experience\nthey have in the platform will help us complete our supply chain. I think in\nthe next five years we will be able to provide a comprehensive human resource\nmanagement solution. \"\n\n### Online assessments\n\nOne of the main problems of the interview is the influence of the\ninterviewer\u2019s logic and feeling on the decision making. In addition to the\nexisting tests, QPage plans to incorporate the online job-seeker into its\nplatform. For example, if a programmer is hired, a test will be put on the\nplatform by the hiring organization's programming team to test the job-seeker.\n\n### Sharing interview results\n\nIf the job-seeker agrees, the results of his interviews will be shared with\nall employers. In doing so, the platform would be additionally reducing the\ncomplexity of the decision-making process in the recruitment process, as well\nas the interview time and providing the employer with more comprehensive\ninformation about the candidate.\n\n### Crow-sourcing interview\n\nShifting to crowd capabilities will ease the recruitment process particularly\nonce a new expertise requires to be joint to the team.\n\n### Managing staff performance\n\nIn the future, with the ability to evaluate the performance of existing staff\nin the organization, this platform will accommodate HR management from A to Z.\n\n### Challenges\n\nTo provide a comprehensive solution, Qpage needs to get **APIs from recruiting\nsites** , which can be a great challenge to work with them.\n\nTo date, only recruitment sites have been the focus of business in Iran.\n**Businesses ' unfamiliarity with HRM technology** makes it difficult for\nQpage to adapt them to this platform. Also, the membership fee payment model\nis not commonly accepted in Iran yet.\n\nThe hiring process alone has many complexities that make people run away from\nit. Qpage aims to cover the whole hiring process and its pre and post\nprocedures. It is very difficult to assemble different capabilities into one\nproduct, as it can confuse HR managers, employers and job seekers.\n\nAll in all, QPage is targeting Nordic and North America market, while offering\na lifelong freemium model for Iranian SMEs as well. Will see more on their\nprogress in near future.\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [ATS](http://techrasa.com/tag/ats/)\n  * [HCM](http://techrasa.com/tag/hcm/)\n  * [HRIS](http://techrasa.com/tag/hris/)\n  * [Human Resources](http://techrasa.com/tag/human-resources/)\n  * [Qpage](http://techrasa.com/tag/qpage/)\n\nSHARE\n\n[__Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftechrasa.com%2F2020%2F02%2F10%2Fqpage-\na-comprehensive-human-resources-management-solution-2%2F)\n[__Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Qpage%2C+a+comprehensive+human+resources+management+solution&url=http%3A%2F%2Ftechrasa.com%2F2020%2F02%2F10%2Fqpage-\na-comprehensive-human-resources-management-solution-2%2F&via=techrasacom)\n[__](http://plus.google.com/share?url=http://techrasa.com/2020/02/10/qpage-a-\ncomprehensive-human-resources-management-\nsolution-2/)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http://techrasa.com/2020/02/10/qpage-\na-comprehensive-human-resources-management-\nsolution-2/)[__](http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http://techrasa.com/2020/02/10/qpage-\na-comprehensive-human-resources-management-\nsolution-2/&media=http://techrasa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Qpage-a-\ncomprehensive-human-resources-management-solution.jpg&description=Existing\nsolutions for human resource management around the world are outdated.

But the workforce \u2013\nand the way we work \u2013 also is rapidly changing, creating a new demand for\nleaders to shift their mindset from a focus on process to a focus on people.\n\nIn this new reality, in which talent is key to competitive advantage, every\nleader needs to think differently about their role in creating and maintaining\nemployee experiences. Human resources executives can play a critical role\nhere, helping build operating models that use enabling technologies to create\nan environment in which workers are treated like critical drivers of value.\n\nThe talent picture is complex as organizations respond to workforce pressures\non four main fronts:\n\n**Diversifying workforce demographics.** For the first time, corporations need\nto manage the presence of up to five distinct generational groups in the\nworkforce, each with its own wants, needs, and motivators. These divergent\nrequirements complicate the process of shaping company culture and delivering\non the employee value proposition (EVP).\n\n**The rise of contingent labor.** According to [KPMG\u2019s 2018 CEO Outlook\nsurvey](https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2018/growing-pains.html), almost all\ncompanies in the U.S. (99%) use a contingent workforce in some capacity.\nIncreasing use of contingent and \u201cgig\u201d workers complicates workforce planning,\ncreating many possible ways to achieve an optimal workforce size, shape, or\ncomposition.\n\n**The shift to a consumer mindset.** Employees are increasingly \u201cshopping\u201d for\njobs, seeking tailored employment experiences that align with their personal\ngoals and values. This mindset not only changes talent attraction and hiring\nstrategies, it also increases the need for an employment experience that\ndelivers a sense of deeper purpose and fulfillment.\n\n**Intelligent automation in the workplace.** Automation technologies already\nhave a deep impact on talent strategies. In addition to increasing\nproductivity and streamlining time-consuming manual work, automation impacts\nworkflows, increases employee reskilling requirements, and creates demand for\nnew roles and new technical specializations.\n\nIn this evolving workplace, creating the right employee experience can help\norganizations attract and retain high-value employees who deliver competitive\nadvantage. In these enhanced environments, these employees also can work more\ninnovatively and more productively.\n\nResearch shows organizations with specific employee experience programs and\nstrategies report up to three times higher profit growth. Part of this growth\nis due to lower operating margins stemming from employees being more\ninnovative in how they work, but lower employee turnover also contributes\nmeasurable savings.\n\nCreating this new kind of employee experience demands that leaders look at\noperations through a customer experience lens. This must be built on\nassessments and analysis, not just company programs, but also the wants and\nneeds of each employee from their career, their workplace, and their employer.\nFrom there, the company can begin to shape tailored experiences for a multi-\ngenerational workforce with many different employee types.\n\nAnd leaders can\u2019t be limited to just insights from annual performance reviews\nor opinion services: They need to keep a finger on the pulse of the current\nemployee experience. What do workers want across their digital, social, and\nenvironmental experiences? Is your organization meeting those needs?\n\nMechanisms and technology that allow for real-time feedback and sentiment\nanalysis can ensure that workers feel heard and allow the organization to\nrespond swiftly in the moments that matter. This feedback can also provide\nopportunities to iterate on the delivered experience based on worker responses\nand fill the gaps in the EVP.\n\nEnhancing employee experiences means placing a greater emphasis on the\nstructural elements that shape that work and thus shape the employees\u2019 day-to-\nday experiences within the organization. Employees need to be surrounded by a\nplatform of human-centered services that are provided or supported by HR. This\nmeans that instead of focusing on process, the HR organization of the future\nwill be more like a platform or service provider that meets the needs of\ndifferent \u201cinternal customers\u201d or worker groups in many different ways.\n\nAll of these elements must come together in order to support transformation.\n\nFor instance, KPMG recently worked with a company in which fierce competition\nfrom emerging fintech firms put this long-standing, multinational financial\nservices company under intense pressure to modernize. To create a business\ncapable of meeting evolving customer expectations and competing in the digital\nworld, they needed to make significant changes to their workforce, technology,\nand culture. The people agenda would drive this change, but they also needed\naccess to in-depth insights into the future of the finance industry and the\ncontribution of technology to business strategy.\n\nThe firm\u2019s current HR information system required a large IT team to support,\nrun, and customize it, with associated cost implications. This, together with\nmany broader challenges in human capital management, meant that millions of\ndollars were exiting their business. They needed to move from a system that\nperformed core HR administration to one that helped them drive talent and\nperformance. They also needed to modernize their operations through better\nprocesses and self-service.\n\nA key consideration was whether to implement a new HR platform. KPMG helped\nshape the firm\u2019s HR transformation strategy, vision, and road map, utilizing\npre-configured tools, templates, transformation enablers, and methodologies\nfrom KPMG Powered Enterprise. This helped manage risk, provide clear scope,\nand support business value.\n\nToday, the firm better enables their workforce and leaders to drive the change\nnecessary to become a modern financial services organization.\n\nIn this digital age, with the emerging and increasingly fierce war for talent\nand skills, creating an employee experience that differentiates employers and\nactually retains talent will be critical. Traditional, task-focused workplace\ncultures are a significant barrier to true digital transformation. Addressing\nand quickly closing the employee experience gap needs to be a business\npriority for every leader today. Instead of making transformation a goal, make\nit a way of business.\n\nTo learn more, visit\n[read.kpmg.us/PoweredHR](https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2019/powered-\nenterprise-\nhr.html?utm_source=vanity&utm_medium=referral&mid=m-00004253&utm_campaign=c-00079549&cid=c-00079549).\n\n[Coronavirus](/insight-center/coronavirus) [Magazine](/magazine)\n[Popular](/most-popular) [Topics](/topics) [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n[Video](/video) [Store](/store) [The Big Idea](/big-ideas) [Visual\nLibrary](/visual-library) [Reading Lists](/reading-lists) [Case\nSelections](/case-selections)\n\n[![Harvard Business Review Home](/resources/css/images/hbr_logo.svg)](/)\n\n[**Subscribe**](/subscribe)\n\n###### Explore HBR\n\n  * [The Latest](/the-latest)\n  * [Most Popular](/most-popular)\n  * [All Topics](/topics)\n  * [Magazine Archive](/magazine)\n  * [The Big Idea](/big-ideas)\n  * [Reading Lists](/reading-lists)\n  * [Case Selections](/case-selections)\n  * [Video](/video)\n  * [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n  * [Webinars](/webinars)\n  * [Visual Library](/visual-library)\n  * [My Library](/my-library)\n  * [Newsletters](/email-newsletters)\n  * [HBR Ascend](https://hbrascend.org/)\n\n###### HBR Store\n\n  * [Article Reprints](/store/articles)\n  * [Books](/store/books)\n  * [Cases](/store/case-studies)\n  * [Collections](/store/collections)\n  * [Magazine Issues](/store/magazine-issues)\n  * [HBR Guide Series](/store/landing/guides)\n  * [HBR 20-Minute Managers](/store/landing/20-minute-managers)\n  * [HBR Emotional Intelligence Series](/store/landing/emotional-intelligence-series)\n  * [HBR Must Reads](/store/landing/mustreads)\n  * [Tools](/store/tools)\n\n###### About HBR\n\n  * [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n  * [Advertise with Us](/hbr-advertising-sales)\n  * [Information for Booksellers/Retailers](/booksellers-retailers)\n  * [Masthead](/about-hbr)\n  * [Global Editions](/global-editions)\n  * [Media Inquiries](/media-inquiries)\n  * [Guidelines for Authors](/guidelines-for-authors-web)\n  * [HBR Analytic Services](/hbr-analytic-services)\n\n###### HBR Subscriber Assistance\n\n  * [Subscribe](/subscribe)\n  * [Subscriber Help](/subscriber-help)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.274.3214](tel:+18002743214)  \n[harvard@cdsfulfillment.com](mailto:harvard@cdsfulfillment.com)  \n[hbr.org/subscriberservices](/subscriberservices)\n\n  * International:  \n[+44.1858.438.412](tel:+441858438412)  \n[(Asia Pacific: +61.2.9158.6127)](tel:+61291586127)  \n[hbr@subscription.co.uk](mailto:hbr@subscription.co.uk)  \n[subscription.co.uk/hbr/help](https://www.subscription.co.uk/hbr/help)\n\n###### HBR.ORG Customer Assistance\n\n  * [Help Center](/help-customer-service-home)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.988.0886](tel:+18009880886)\n\n  *   * International:  \n[617.783.7500](tel:+16177837500)\n\n  * Email:  \n[customerservice@harvardbusiness.org](mailto:customerservice@harvardbusiness.org)\n\n  * [Copyright Permissions](/permissions)\n\n###### Follow HBR\n\n  * __[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/HBR)\n  * __[Twitter](http://twitter.com/HarvardBiz)\n  * __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review?trk=biz-companies-cym)\n  * __[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harvard_business_review/?hl=en)\n  * __[Your Newsreader](http://feeds.hbr.org/harvardbusiness/)\n\n![Harvard Business Publishing](/resources/images/2018/new_logo_May11.png)\n\n  * [About Us](/corporate/about)\n  * [Careers](/corporate/careers)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n  * [Copyright Information](/corporate/copyright)\n  * [Trademark Policy](http://trademark.harvard.edu/pages/trademark-notice)\n\n  \n\nHarvard Business Publishing:\n\n  * [Higher Education](http://hbsp.harvard.edu/)\n  * [Corporate Learning](http://www.harvardbusiness.org)\n  * [Harvard Business Review](http://hbr.org/)\n  * [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Harvard Business School Publishing.

Management](/originals/leadership/leadership-and-management)\n\n![HR Recruiting on Social Media: HR Best\nPractices](https://cdn.smartbrief.com/sites/default/files/styles/originals_full_summary_banner_style/public/original-\ncontent/pexels-photo-1092671.jpeg?itok=9XcsKIYZ)\n\n[](//www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=300)\n[](//www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=300)\n[](//www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=300)\n[](//www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=300)\n\nYour company\u2019s future top talent could be just a few clicks away on your\ncompany\u2019s social media platforms. When HR professionals use social media\neffectively as a recruitment tool, they can more easily target top candidates.\nIn fact, posting job openings on social media platforms can lift application\nrates by 30% to 50%, according to a recent white paper from\n[iCIMS.](https://www.icims.com/solutions/recruiting-software/)\n\nIf you aren\u2019t using the latest social media techniques, you might be losing\nsome top talent to other companies\u2019 HR departments. According to a study by\nthe Aberdeen Group, 73% of workers between ages 18 and 34 found their last job\nvia [social\nrecruiting](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gradsoflife/2018/01/18/social-\nrecruiting-is-growing-are-you-prepared/#6c0413f29cae). Check out these quick,\neffective ways to immediately elevate your social media recruitment game.\n\n## Diversify Your Platform Strategy\n\nUsing various social networks is ideal for targeting top talent. Here\u2019s how\nyou can optimize your social media strategies to fit each platform:\n\n  * **LinkedIn** : You don\u2019t want to cast an excessively wide net, so it\u2019s best to seek communities of professionals in target industries. Limit your job postings on this platform, but don\u2019t neglect it altogether. Instead, visit groups regularly to contribute to conversations, answer questions, or spotlight industry news.  \n\n  * **Facebook** : Here, you can expand your talent acquisition search by creating job postings from within your company\u2019s Facebook page. Post accurate descriptions of job openings , and include a photo if possible. Invite potential candidates to get in touch via Facebook Messenger with any questions.  \n\n  * **Instagram** : Because many young professionals spend most of their time on Instagram, use this space to capitalize on visual messages. Post pictures to highlight examples of company culture \u2014 such as employee lunches or events \u2014 and showcase employees\u2019 achievements.  \n\n  * **Twitter** : Post job openings with relevant hashtags, including the general job-seeking terms and job location. You can also use this platform to search for job candidates who are seeking positions similar to your openings. Try reaching out to them directly with an invitation to check out the job listing.\n\n## Provide Visuals\n\nIn general, mix up the content you post to keep visitors returning. Successful\nbrands use images and videos to their advantage, and the same holds true for\nrecruiting efforts.\n\nUse your phone to take photos of employees in your workplace and give\npotential hires a realistic look into what a day at your company looks like.\nShowcasing high employee value events like training and development sessions\ncan also serve to make your company look more enticing.\n\n## Post Frequently\n\nPotential hires who are social media savvy want to see that your company\nregularly updates its social media pages. Ensure that you are posting content\nat least two or three times a week. The key: Give reasons for potential hires\nto keep returning, even if they aren\u2019t actively job-seeking at the moment.\nIndustry experts call this process: [sourcing passive\ncandidates](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/5-tried-and-true-methods-\nfor-sourcing-passive-candidates/).\n\n## Include a Mix of Engaging Content\n\nYou\u2019ll want your social media platforms to be a place where you can highlight\ncompany culture. Some examples include infographics relating to your industry,\nsurveys regarding trends in your field, and news affecting the workforce\nyou\u2019re targeting. You could also pose questions to potential candidates. If a\ncertain article might appeal to a target audience for a job you\u2019re seeking to\nfill, provide a link.\n\n## Involve Your Whole Team\n\nInclude all of your employees in your social media recruitment efforts, not\njust the communications and social media departments. Encourage them to engage\nwith the company\u2019s social media platforms, contribute to conversations and\ninteract with followers. You might ask that each employee take a few minutes\neach week to contribute to the social media in these ways. Over time, their\nefforts will compound to showcase a [strong employee\nbrand](https://www.fastcompany.com/90256963/employers-your-company-brand-\nneeds-to-reflect-your-culture) at your organization, which can be a top draw\nfor potential job seekers.\n\nSocial media is a highly effective tool for HR to promote jobs and attract\ntalent in today\u2019s world. If you invest time into refining your company\u2019s\nsocial media recruitment strategies, you can quickly widen your talent pool at\nvery little expense. It\u2019s definitely a best practice for human resources\nmanagement.\n\nFor more HR industry news with actionable insights, [sign up for SmartBrief

This Morning](https://www.inc.com/newsletter), a daily\nnews digest curated for those passionate about entrepreneurship._\n\nYou've probably heard the term \"people analytics\" before. Still, if I were to\nask how your company uses them _right now_ , the odds are good that you'd say:\n\"We don't.\"\n\nThat's [according to a study](https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/linkedin-just-\nrevealed-results-of-its-2020-global-talent-trends-report-there-are-some-big-\nsurprises.html) published Wednesday by LinkedIn, which surveyed 7,089 talent\nprofessionals and hiring managers last fall on a wide range of topics. The\nstudy spotlights people analytics as one of four major talent trends to watch\nin 2020--which is interesting because 55 percent of surveyed talent\nprofessionals also said they \"still need help putting basic people analytics\ninto practice.\"\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the term, here's a quick definition: People\nanalytics basically means using data to bolster your HR department's ability\nto consistently recruit, hire, and retain great employees. The LinkedIn survey\nnotes that many companies--68 percent of those surveyed--use data to measure\nemployee performance, which is a great starting point. But, it adds, a\ndistinct minority of companies currently use analytics to identify flight\nrisks within their ranks, reduce bias in hiring and promotions, predict a job\ncandidate's potential success in a role, and so on.\n\nTranslation: There's an opportunity here. Earlier this month, in a story about\nthe biggest changes coming to hiring and jobs in 2020, my colleague Brit Morse\nwrote about [how Salesforce employs people\nanalytics](https://www.inc.com/brit-morse/human-resources-trends-2020-best-of-\ninc.html). It's surprisingly unfancy: The company uses the same kinds of\nemployee surveys that might measure employee performance to help managers\ndetermine who is engaged, has great company-improving ideas, and makes a habit\nof helping co-workers. That same data also helps Salesforce identify employees\nwho are struggling under specific managers, which allows the company to solve\nworkplace disputes before they explode.\n\nIt's probably not an unfamiliar data-gathering strategy for a lot of companies\nand it requires no additional costs, yet Salesforce seems to yield a lot of\nreturn from it. The basic difference here is the ability to analyze the data\nyou get on your people. While the LinkedIn study reports that half of those\nsurveyed said their companies were good at collecting and maintaining some\nform of people analytics data, only 39 percent felt confident analyzing it.\nUsing the data to solve existing problems? Just 37 percent. And using it to\nproactively solve future problems? A mere 29 percent.\n\nIf you have the money to invest in this area, you can. A growing industry has\nemerged around HR data collection and analysis in recent years, featuring\ncompanies like Tableau, Looker, and Twine (which was [a 2019 _Inc._ Rising\nStars honoree](https://www.inc.com/emily-canal/twine-human-resources-software-\ndata-metrics-evernote-30-under-30-2019.html)). Otherwise, your solution might\nbe as simple as tweaking your existing processes to learn something new about\nthose who work for you.\n\nYou almost certainly use data to inform your operational decisions on topics\nlike sales, budgeting, and funding.

college\ndegree\n\nPublished Thu, Oct 3 201912:24 PM EDTUpdated Thu, Oct 3 20192:11 PM EDT\n\n[Daniel Bukszpan](https://grow.acorns.com/daniel-bukszpan/)\n\nVIDEO2:1402:14\n\nWhat AI is learning about the job market\n\n[At Work](https://www.cnbc.com/work/)\n\nKey Points\n\n  * With the unemployment rate below 4% and at least a half million technology jobs open, companies like IBM are using AI to identify talent in the workforce that often goes overlooked by recruiters and HR.\n  * The role of AI in hiring is leading to more opportunities for the less educated and other disadvantaged communities.\n  * IBM's SkillsBuild platform is being used overseas and will be introduced to the U.S. market in 2020.\n\nWith the unemployment rate at a low 3.7% and the skills shortage severe,\ncorporations need to get creative about finding talented job candidates. IBM\nis among the technology giants testing new methods involving artificial\nintelligence to overcome the labor market challenges.\n\nAI has been applied to the job application process directly as a method to\nprevent human bias in hiring decisions. Now more companies are using AI\nassessment tools to reverse-engineer job roles and find candidates often\noverlooked by recruiters.\n\n[IBM](/quotes/?symbol=IBM) introduced its SkillsBuild platform in France in\nMay 2019 with the goal of identifying job skills and employment opportunities\nfor members of disadvantaged communities. It will be rolled out in Germany in\nthe coming months, followed by India, and then IBM plans to bring the platform\nto the U.S. in 2020, by which time it is likely that the program will have\nthousands of users, the company says.\n\nThe IBM initiative provides jobseekers, including those with long-term\nunemployment, refugees, asylum seekers and veterans, with career fit\nassessments, training, personalized coaching and learning needed to reenter\nthe workforce. SkillsBuild has partnered with several [NGO\npartners](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__skillsbuild.org_-23ngo-2Dpartners&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=LO_8KzsOlAGvgA6hdGI4v02U_XLiES0sR51Zca0yIy4&amp;r=Ojx0SYJNA1GBYLR0t2Wxe6TjjSx8TcqTZsujYfHmqMg&amp;m=QiU6zZ6nwLD2GB88-LqYcPIl2YOv4knSa9WG8KXRuWs&amp;s=ugU7P-y4YskiYWbv74smUmt8-mbgraEVXBLQTfpj1E0&amp;e=)\nand nonprofits to form, in IBM's words, \"a new, sustainable hiring mindset,\"\nbut it is not currently used as part of the application process for IBM jobs,\nspecifically.\n\n## Reskilling workers\n\nGrace Suh, vice president of education for IBM Citizenship, said the platform\nis meant to be an upskilling tool.\n\n\"[Applicants] come from vulnerable populations, and they're looking to move\ninto competitive New Collar roles,\" Suh said, referring to the term used by\nIBM CEO Ginni Rometty to refer to the need to transition the traditional blue-\ncollar workforce to jobs in a tech-led economy. The IBM CEO has said [AI will\nchange \"100% of jobs\"](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/02/ibm-ceo-ginni-romettys-\nsolution-to-closing-the-skills-gap-in-america.html) over the next decade.\n\n\"These roles include web development, customer service, eventually even\ncybersecurity. This is about reskilling, upskilling,\" Suh told CNBC.\n\n\"I think what AI is helping us do is uncover things that you wouldn't have\notherwise seen,\" said Jacob Hsu, CEO of workforce data science company\nCatalyte, at CNBC's Capital Exchange Summit in Washington, D.C. on Thursday.\n\"Our company is built on the premise that talent and ability are evenly\ndistributed, even if opportunity hasn't been.\n\n\"We're using AI to identify exceptional people from all walks of life that\nhave remarkable ability to actually be very rapidly retrained to not just be\ngood engineers but the very highest-performing, most successful engineers in\nthe industry. So we're literally hiring truck drivers and teachers, retail\nworkers and fast-food workers ... and very rapidly, within 20 weeks, getting\nthem through a computer science degree and getting them into not just actual\njobs but proving they can be highest performers in those roles.\"\n\nWe believe ultimately everyone is a superhero; we just have to help them\nuncover what their superpower is.\n\nJacob Hsu\n\nCEO of workforce data science company Catalyte\n\nHsu said they are distinct from the focus on whether AI will replace humans.\n\n\"There's this really unique spot where we're at where AI and technology can\nreally help advance what companies are looking for,\" said Irina Novoselsky,\nCareerBuilder CEO. \"There's things that we did 10, 20, 30 years ago that we no\nlonger need to do that there's definitely technology that's going to take\nover. But if you think about the dynamics of where we are today and there's\nnot enough supply to even fill current demand, there's only two places that\nthis can come from.\"\n\nUpskilling workers is needed for critical social reasons, namely to reverse\nthe hollowing out of the middle class, she said, but there will be jobs that\nthere aren't really any candidates available to fill. \"What's important is how\ndo we reskill the population that we have to fill the jobs we have, and how do\nwe embrace technology where it's needed,\" Novoselsky said.\n\n## Hiring below the college degree\n\nWithin the IBM Skillsbuild platform are AI tools like MyInnerGenius, created\nby San Diego area-based GreatBizTools, which designs AI products to find\ntalent in nontraditional ways.\n\nMyInnerGenius is helping fill entry-level and mid-level IT roles for IBM's\n[New Collar program](https://www.ibm.com/us-\nen/employment/newcollar/index.html) in the U.S. and SkillsBuild program in\nEurope. Many of these roles are being filled by applicants with no prior\nexperience in technology, many of whom don't have college degrees.\n\n\"There are currently more than 500,000 IT job openings, and colleges are only\nproducing around 50,000 people with degrees in IT per year,\" said Denise\nLeaser, president of GreatBizTools. The skills shortage has made it more\nnecessary than ever for companies like IBM to look outside of their usual\napplicant pool. \"IBM wants to open up IT to more people, especially people who\nmay have never thought of or considered an IT role before.\"\n\nFor more on tech, transformation and the future of work, join CNBC at the [@\nWork: People + Machines Summit](https://www.cnbcevents.com/work-people-\nmachines/) in San Francisco on Nov. 4. Leaders from Dropbox, SAS, McKinsey and\nmore will teach us how to balance the needs of today with the possibilities of\ntomorrow, and the winning strategies to compete.\n\nWhile she would not disclose too many details about how MyInnerGenius works,\nshe said that it isolates a candidate's personal traits to find jobs that\nwould be a good match.\n\nThe assessments screen for cognitive abilities, skills, detail orientation,\nproblem solving and deductive reasoning, as well as personality traits like\nempathy, risk aversion, leadership, and problem solving, Leaser said. \"It\ntakes a full assessment of the individual's cognitive abilities, and creates a\ncomprehensive competency profile that's unique to them, then uses algorithms\nthat match them to jobs that require different competencies.\"\n\n## AI limitations\n\nAI's role continues to expand in human resources settings. IBM is among\ncompanies already using AI to [predict which current employees will\nquit](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/03/ibm-ai-can-predict-with-95-percent-\naccuracy-which-employees-will-quit.html) and while other efforts underway are\ndesigned to [attract applicants with the desired skill\nsets](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/24/job-postings-you-want-most-will-be-\nwritten-by-artificial-intelligence.html).\n\nThe state of California recently passed a resolution encouraging the\ndevelopment of AI tools to reduce bias in the hiring process, but hiring AI\nalso has [raised concerns](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/silicon-valley-is-\nstumped-even-a-i-cannot-remove-bias-from-hiring.html) within the data\nanalytics community about the potential for new forms of algorithmic bias, as\nwell as general concerns among human resources professionals.\n\nKrishna Powell, CEO of the HR 4 Your Small Biz human resources consulting\nfirm, said AI is only as good as the person who writes the algorithm, and it's\nmissing the gut feelings and strong hunches that can sometimes lead to a great\nhire or prevent a bad one. She added that AI screening systems could also be\ngamed by any candidate who's prepared for it and knows how to respond to\nspecific questions to gain a desired result.\n\n\"You can have a job candidate who knows what to say and do to successfully\npass any AI tests or tools for job placement, but when hired the leader\ndiscovers this person does not match up to who he or she appeared to be\nthrough the AI tool,\" she said.\n\nAndrei Baloleanu, Growth Manager at the 123 Form Builder data management\ncompany, said companies adopting any sort of AI should phase it in slowly, and\nbe prepared to see mistakes along the way.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence in itself is still in its infancy, meaning that, at\nthis point, most of the AI systems, in all industries, are still learning,\" he\nsaid. \"This means that your HR AI might fail every now and again, as part of\nits own learning process.\"\n\nDespite being a big booster for GreatBizTools, Leaser shared the same concerns\nas others in the HR field. \"AI can add efficiencies, but it should not replace\nthe human factor,\" she said.\n\nLeaser said that no matter how a great an AI tool your company has at its\ndisposal, human input remains essential to business hiring, training and up-\nskilling practices, and should never be sidelined in favor of technology.\n\n\"We believe ultimately everyone is a superhero; we just have to help them\nuncover what their superpower is,\" Catalyte CEO Hsu said.\n\nRelated Tags\n\n  * [International Business Machines Corp](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes?symbol=IBM)\n  *

Will it change conservative corporate culture?\n\n![Author\nimage](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/960_540/images/live/p0/7f/sc/p07fsc3b.jpg)\n\n### By Lu-Hai Liang\n\n9th March 2020\n\nT\n\nTao Yu usually works in a stylish office in Shanghai, China's major financial\nhub, as a member of German automaker Porsche's marketing department. But since\nthe Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak the 28-year-old, like tens of millions of\nher compatriots, has been forced to work from home.\n\nTao is from Hubei, the southern province where the virus originated, and she\nis working from her family home in Huanggang, a city of 7.5 million people. It\nis the second most affected city, after Wuhan. \"I get up, have breakfast, come\nto my room and start working,\" she says.\n\nTao is not a fan of working from home, but it's what many of her neighbours\nare doing as the city is in lockdown. She worries about what her colleagues\nthink of her. \"I want to show that working at home and in the office is the\nsame, but I'm worried my colleagues will think it's not fair. They might think\nworking from home is luxurious,\" she explains.\n\n> ## Since 3 February, millions of Chinese have been experiencing the pros and\n> cons of the home office for the first time\n\nIn China, working from home is much less common than in the West. But since 3\nFebruary, when local governments and companies across the nation encouraged\nworkers to stay at home, millions of Chinese have been experiencing the pros\nand cons of the home office for the first time.\n\nWith normally busy streets in major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and\nGuangzhou eerily quiet, this mass experiment in working from home has led to a\nsurge in demand for video-conferencing apps such as Tencent's WeChat Work and\nAlibaba-owned DingTalk. US company Zoom, another video-conferencing provider,\nhas seen its stocks rise, counter to overall trends as coronavirus fears drag\ndown the market.\n\nChinese workers have had mixed reactions to the experiment. Some complain of\nintrusive bosses who cannot believe their employees can be trusted to work\nfrom home; some are distracted by family members or find it difficult to\nfocus, while others are embracing the experience, enjoying improved\nproductivity; some even report improved love lives.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/86/2f/p0862fs0.jpg)\n\nWorkers queue to enter a Shanghai office on February 10 after an extended\nholiday to slow the spread of the virus. Now, many such employees work\nremotely (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n **' Forced to adapt'**\n\nSun Meng, 32, from Liaoning province, works in Beijing as a curriculum planner\nand designer for online education company VIPKid. She's been working from home\nfor a month - and doesn't miss the long trek to and from the office. \"It feels\ngreat, because normally I commute four hours there and back to work,\" she\nexplains.  \n\nShe can't move closer to work because her husband's hukou (a household\nregistration system that grants access to welfare facilities) means her three-\nyear-old son is tied to their local kindergarten. \"It's a public kindergarten\n- the only one he can go to. If he were to go to a closer one [to her office],\nwe'd have to go private and it's too expensive.\"\n\n> ## At the office, people have to clock in and out, but now they start their\n> day by sending a \u2018check-in\u2019 photo to a DingTalk group\n\nSun has applied unsuccessfully in the past to work from home two days a week\n(the company instead allowed her to shift her working hours). But since staff\nhave been forced to work from home Sun says her CEO has admitted workers are\nbeing more efficient. And internal ways of working have also changed to\naccommodate the new normal. At the office, people have to clock in and out,\nbut now they start their day by sending a \"check-in\" photo to a DingTalk group\nand fill in daily work reports through one of the platform's apps. \"Now we are\nforced to work from home, they [HR] are forced to adapt how they monitor,\" she\nsays.\n\nThe best thing about home working, Sun says, is that her son doesn't have to\nwait until late in the evening to see her. \"I can close my laptop immediately\n[after work] and start playing with him.\"\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/86/2f/p0862frl.jpg)\n\nDemand has also surged for DingTalk, which makes intelligent conference\nsystems and other tools for remote workers (Credit: Getty Images)\n\n **' Makes things harder'**\n\nIt's not clear exactly what proportion of the workforce was allowed to\ntelecommute before Covid-19 emerged. Fifty-one percent of businesses in China\nsay they have a flexible workspace policy, according to the [2019 IWG Global\nWorkspace Survey](http://assets.regus.com/pdfs/iwg-workplace-survey/iwg-\nworkplace-survey-2019.pdf); the corresponding figure for the US is 69%. Yet\nflexibility is defined differently by different organisations: to some it can\nmean simply the ability to control your hours or manage your own workload.\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that Chinese workers use (or are allowed to use)\nhome working considerably less than the US, for example, where figures from\nGallup showed that by 2017 [43% of\nworkers](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/206033/america-coming-\nworkplace-home-alone.aspx) worked remotely at least some of the time.  \n\nJay Milliken, senior partner and Asia regional lead for consultancy Prophet,\nbelieves China's lower home working rate is linked to traditional workplace\nculture. \"The organisational culture of Chinese companies overall still has a\nlong way to go - with creative agencies and tech start-ups being exceptions,\"\nhe says. Many Chinese companies still adopt a highly top-down management\nstyle, with requirements such as their employees punch in and out for work,\nand their bonus and KPIs tied closely to attendance. \"The 'work-from-home'\nstyle goes against their belief of how employees should be managed,\" says\nMilliken.\n\n> ## Working from home made administration harder, due to less efficient\n> communication and employees slacking off at work doing personal things \u2013 Xin\n> Sun\n\nXin Sun, 36, a manager at Pingan Bank in Shenzhen, certainly feels he has less\ncontrol over his employees when they're not in the office. \"Working from home\nmade administration harder, due to less efficient communication and employees\nslacking off at work doing personal things,\" he says. \"When working from home,\nmy team members sometimes respond to me late, which makes me feel out of\ncontrol. Usually we have weekly meetings, but during the work-from-home\nperiod, I host daily meetings, just to make sure everyone is on the same page\nand has something to work on every day. Also, I've asked them to report to me\nevery day what they've done and what they plan to do tomorrow. I find it an\neffective way to motivate them and not fall behind,\" he says.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/86/2f/p0862fqd.jpg)\n\nUniversities have taken measures to limit exposure by switching to online\nclasses conducted by video conference (Credit: Getty Images)\n\nBut requirements to check in more with managers are hitting some employees\nhard. Yang, 23, a producer at Chinese games company NetEase, says she now has\nmore conference calls each day, cutting into the time available to do her\nwork. \"Before the outbreak happened when I was at the workplace, it was not\nmandatory to report deliverables every day, but now everything you've done\nshould be carefully recorded in daily reports and sent to the boss. I'm afraid\nthat it reduces my efficiency,\" says Yang, who chose to use only one name.\n\n**Here to stay?**\n\nAlthough Chinese work culture might be more conservative, in technological\nterms it is well set up for working from home. WeChat - a [super\napp](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190719-super-apps) that combines\nmessaging, file transfer, video-conferencing capabilities, e-payment and other\nfunctions - is ubiquitous, with over a billion users in China. Matthew\nBrennan, who is writing a book about WeChat, says that for many small and\nmedium-sized enterprises using WeChat is the obvious option, given it takes\nthe place of apps like Slack (which is sometimes blocked in China) or email.\n\nAnd in many cases, working from home would help employers hit by [sky-high\noffice rental rates](https://www.theinvestor.jll/news/china/office/whats-\ndriving-chinas-high-office-rents/) and employees suffering from long commutes.\nYet it is hard to tell whether this enforced period of home working will lead\nto the practice becoming more widespread in China in the long-term.\n\n> ## People often feel stressed out, both mentally and physically. Now many\n> have tried working from home and have found it's a way of balancing work and\n> life, I believe there will be more demand \u2013 Qun Li\n\nQun Li, associate professor of enterprise culture at Beijing Jiaotong\nUniversity, believes demand from employees will certainly increase. \"They have\nlimited time spent with their families, taking care of kids or accompanying\ntheir parents. They also have difficulty coping with their personal well-\nbeing. Since working and commuting occupy almost their entire schedule, people\noften feel stressed out both mentally and physically. Now many have tried\nworking from home and have found it's a way of balancing work and life, I\nbelieve there will be more demand,\" he says.\n\nBut whether employees get what they want will depend on the type of work they\ndo and how team-oriented it is, he adds. Industries such as media and tech\nallow more flexible schedules and a higher possibility of granting permission\nto work from home. \"But traditional industries that need workers on site -\ninvolving production lines, high demand for team co-ordination - will still be\naverse to home working,\" he says.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/976_549/images/live/p0/86/2f/p0862frk.jpg)\n\nWith more than a billion users, WeChat is a dominant super app. Demand for\nWeChat Work, its enterprise product, has surged in recent weeks (Credit: Getty\nImages)\n\nZhang Xiaomeng, associate professor of organisational behaviour at the Cheung\nKong Graduate School of Business in Beijing, points out that many companies\nhave invested in online office platforms and related training during this\nperiod, which will make them more likely to use such features in the future.\nAttitudes are changing too, she says. \"I think this 'autocratic' management\napproach is getting less popular, and more managers are caring more about\nemployees' needs.\n\n\"The Covid-19 outbreak is just another chance for companies to re-examine the\nrelationship between companies and employees, and to elevate their corporate\nculture to be mutually beneficial.\"  \n\nMilliken of Prophet points out that more flexibility could come with a\npotential downside. \"The adoption of work-from-home technology could actually\nmake the overwork culture even more widespread,\" he says, referring to the\ninfamous [\"996\"\nculture](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190718-china-996), in which\ntech and start-up employees work from nine in the morning to nine in the\nevening, six days a week.\n\nCindy Song, 29, who is a manager for PR firm Ruder Finn, is on the fence about\nwhether home working is a success. \"Our home is not big - husband and I are\nworking in the same room, we disturb each other,\" she says. She's also worried\nabout the future; her boss says this year might be hard if clients cancel\nevents due to the coronavirus and reduce marketing budgets.\n\nBut one positive has been her \"improved marriage\" due to spending 24 hours a\nday with her husband. \"Before this 'special time' we were so busy; busy\nworking and coming home very late. Now we can spend more time with each other,\nwe are closer than before,\" she says.\n\n_Additional reporting: Manyu Jiang_\n\n[Share using Email](mailto:?subject=Shared from\nBBC:How%20Covid-19%20led%20to%20a%20nationwide%20work-from-\nhome%20experiment&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fworklife%2Farticle%2F20200309-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-advice-chinas-work-at-home-\nexperiment%3Focid%3Dww.social.link.email)[Share on\nTwitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How%20Covid-19%20led%20to%20a%20nationwide%20work-\nfrom-\nhome%20experiment&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fworklife%2Farticle%2F20200309-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-advice-chinas-work-at-home-\nexperiment%3Focid%3Dww.social.link.twitter&via=BBC_Worklife)[Share on\nFacebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fworklife%2Farticle%2F20200309-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-advice-chinas-work-at-home-\nexperiment%3Focid%3Dww.social.link.facebook&t=How%20Covid-19%20led%20to%20a%20nationwide%20work-\nfrom-home%20experiment)[Share on\nLinkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fworklife%2Farticle%2F20200309-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-advice-chinas-work-at-home-\nexperiment%3Focid%3Dww.social.link.linkedin&title=How%20Covid-19%20led%20to%20a%20nationwide%20work-\nfrom-home%20experiment)\n\nOpen share tools\n\n[Like us on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BBCWorklife)[Follow us on\nTwitter](https://www.twitter.com/BBC_Worklife)[Follow us on\nInstagram](https://www.instagram.com/BBC_Worklife)[Sign up to our\nnewsletter](http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/)\n\n## Similar Articles\n\n[![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/304_171/images/live/p0/85/nz/p085nzfv.jpg)](/worklife/article/20200304-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-update-why-people-are-stockpiling)\n\n[The irrationality of panic buying](/worklife/article/20200304-coronavirus-\ncovid-19-update-why-people-are-stockpiling)\n\nAround the BBC\n\n## Explore the BBC\n\n  * [Home](https://www.bbc.co.uk)\n  * [News](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news)\n  * [Sport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport)\n  * [Weather](https://www.bbc.co.uk/weather)\n  * [iPlayer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer)\n  * [Sounds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds)\n  * [CBBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc)\n  * [CBeebies](https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbeebies)\n  * [Food](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food)\n  * [Bitesize](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize)\n  * [Arts](https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts)\n  * [Taster](https://www.bbc.co.uk/taster)\n  * [Local](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/localnews)\n  * [Three](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree)\n\n  * [Terms of Use](https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/terms/)\n  * [About the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/privacy/)\n  * [Cookies](https://www.bbc.co.uk/usingthebbc/cookies/)\n  * [Accessibility Help](https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/)\n  * [Parental Guidance](https://www.bbc.co.uk/guidance)\n  * [Contact the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact)\n  * [Get Personalised Newsletters](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcnewsletter)\n\n _Copyright (C) 2020 BBC._ The BBC is not responsible for the content of\nexternal sites.
