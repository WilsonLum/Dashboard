Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n[\u95b1\u8b80\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u672c](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/?p=134363&preview=true)\n\nWith the COVID-19 outbreak bringing about unprecedented times, companies\nworldwide have taken steps to reevaluate their practices and do what's best to\nsustain amid tough times.\n\nFor instance, some companies are implementing hiring freezes, wage freezes and\npromotion freezes, while others are introducing remote working alternatives\nand additional financial assistance.\n\nIn line with this, Aon's latest APAC Pulse Survey - _Navigating the impact of\nCOVID-19 on workplace and rewards practices_ takes a further look at the\nworkplace, HR and compensation policies being implemented by 304 companies in\nthe region.\n\nRespondents included companies from Southeast Asian countries - Malaysia,\nSingapore, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam, as well as\nGreater China, Japan & Korea region, and the Pacific Region.\n\n### 85.5% of firms are proceeding with planned pay increases and bonuses\n\nWhile companies are cautious of their compensation plans today, close to nine\nin 10 of those surveyed have indicated that they will continue with their\nplanned salary increases and bonus payouts, a popular option in Southeast Asia\n(85.7%) and the Japan & Korea region (90.6%).\n\nThat said, some companies are also taking measures to freeze salaries (4.9%),\nand adjust their incentive plans, i.e. targets and payouts (4.6%). This was\nlargely seen among Pacific countries, where about 10% were actively\nconsidering salary freezes and bonus reductions.\n\n![Priya-Mar-2020-Aon-study-screenshot-3](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/27105721/Screenshot-2020-03-27-at-10.57.03-700x399.png)\n![Priya-Mar-2020-Aon-study-screenshot-3](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/27105617/Screenshot-2020-03-27-at-10.55.59-700x394.png)\n\n\n\nWhen further broken down into industry-specific insights, the following chart\nillustrates that even across industries, a large majority will see no\nadjustments to pay. However, the healthcare sector, retail & wholesale trade,\nand professional services sector have still reported salary freezes and muted\nbonus payouts.\n\n![Priya-Mar-2020-Aon-study-screenshot-5](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/27110112/Screenshot-2020-03-27-at-10.59.52-700x378.png)\n\n\n\n### Close to three in 10 firms are adopting a cautious approach to hiring\n\nWhile the above is in place, close to 45% of respondents have said they are\n'closely reviewing' their workforce plans, with 29% adopting a cautious\napproach to hiring. Of the remaining, 11% are implementing a hiring freeze,\nwhile a lesser 5% see a potential downsizing.\n\nOn the contrary, 55% of respondents do not see any impact on their workforce\nplans.\n\n![Priya-Mar-2020-Aon-study-screenshot-6](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/27110634/Screenshot-2020-03-27-at-11.06.21-700x401.png)\n\n\n\nBy sector, the hospitality and healthcare sectors are expected to see a hiring\nfreeze (28.6% and 10% respectively) and potential downsizing (57.1% and 10%\nrespectively) in the coming months.\n\n![Priya-Mar-2020-Aon-study-screenshot-7](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/27110859/Screenshot-2020-03-27-at-11.08.44-700x397.png)\n\n### Top welfare measures adopted: Protective equipment, family care support,\nand employee assistance programmes\n\nIn terms of employee welfare, respondents were given a list of welfare\nmeasures, and asked to select those that they've adopted in thier\norganisation, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTo this, a majority (70.4%) said they had provided employees with protective\nequipment such as masks and googles, while a second majority (45.4%) provided\nfamily care support.\n\nThird came employee assistance programmes (EAPs), with close to four in 10\n(39.5%) of companies having implemented them; on the other hand, additional\nfinancial allowance, as well as catered meals (which would reduce the\nfrequency of employees visiting crowded places), were the two least popular\nmeasures undertaken, with just 4.9% and 6.6% implementing them respectively.\n\n![Priya-Mar-2020-Aon-study-screenshot](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/27101225/Screenshot-2020-03-27-at-10.12.06-700x316.png)\n\n\n\nWhat stood out was that while EAPs were proactively implemented in the Pacific\nregion (59%), as well as special arrangements such as flexibility for\nvulnerable groups (18%), measures such as providing additional insurance\ncoverage for employees have less prevalence than other APAC regions (2.6% vs\nAPAC 12.2%).\n\n![Priya-Mar-2020-Aon-study-screenshot-2](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/27102553/Screenshot-2020-03-27-at-10.25.15-700x390.png)\n\n### Is HR prepared?\n\nUndoubtedly, HR professionals have a huge role to play in managing the\nworkforce and implementing contingency plans during such times of crisis, in\norder to minimise any disruption to normal operations.\n\nIn light of COVID-19, HR departments were asked about the main challenges they\nfaced - and a majority across APAC indicated the management of crisis\nresponses, and business continuity plans (67%).\n\nA close majority also indicated the challenge of managing flexible work\narrangements (63.5%), while over five in 10 (55.6%) indicated increasing\nawareness in employees.\n\nWhile this was so, a lesser few (13.2%) indicated the challenge of having\ninadequate medical insurance coverage for employees.\n\n![Priya-Mar-2020-Aon-study-screenshot-8](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/27111429/Screenshot-2020-03-27-at-11.14.17-700x448.png)\n\n\n\nOne key point that stood out was - when asked if their HR department was\nadequately trained, equipped and ready to deal with challenges posed by the\noutbreak, one a scale of 1-5, most companies rated 3 (42.3%). At the same\ntime, close to three in 10 (27.6%) rated 4.\n\nAmong the top five industries with the most respondents for the survey,\nrespondents in financial services (19%) were the most likely to believe that\ntheir HR departments were sufficiently ready (rating 5) to deal with COVID-19.\n\n![Priya-Mar-2020-Aon-study-screenshot-9](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/27111934/Screenshot-2020-03-27-at-11.19.16-700x393.png)\n![Priya-Mar-2020-Aon-study-screenshot-10](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/27112322/Screenshot-2020-03-27-at-11.23.09-700x382.png)\n\n_Lead image and infographics / Provided_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

This can range from a complete\nreinvention of identity and purpose to just a slight shift that includes the\nnew partner: its history, narrative and critical traits.\n\nWhen this cultural identity shift is not even considered, the original DNA is\nso strong that it risks pushing out the acquired partner and setting the\nacquisition up for failure. Assets might not be operated at their optimum,\ncustomers don\u2019t feel heard and critical top talent might walk out the door,\ntaking their market and technical knowledge base, and their client\nrelationships with them.\n\nCompanies with a strong DNA typically demonstrate the following common traits:\n\n  * Even when it\u2019s far back in history, the founder has a name and a face that is familiar to all employees. The originating story is well-known and the current core values are still connected to some of the founding principles\n  * There is a \u2013 often well-intended \u2013 sense of superiority. Their own culture, processes and leadership style are seen as best in class. It is what makes them successful\n  * Leaders have grown up in the company. They have demonstrated that they carry the same DNA, breath the core values and understand the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to successfully navigate in the company\n  * With that might come a certain company blindness. \u2018The way we do things here\u2019 is not challenged enough. New hires are immediately absorbed by the well-oiled onboarding process and operational rhythm\n\n\n\n**Looking outwards**\n\nWhen M&A leadership teams, decision committees and integration task forces are\nmainly composed of experts of the acquiring company, the tactical integration\nplans are solely built based on the assumptions of the dominant culture.\n\n> There is a need to really get to know the underlying identity of the\n> acquired organisation\n\nAs they get a clear mandate to integrate, find synergies, implement best\npractices and get a return on investment as fast as possible, there is a risk\nthey overlook the original strategic intent of the acquisition and overwhelm\nthe new partner with an integration overload of dashboards and processes that\nare not suited to their context and operational reality. This often leads to a\nprolonged overload on the organisation and a strong internal focus, putting\nthe market connections and client relationships at risk.\n\nIt is critical to go beyond mapping the technical base, asset network, HR\npolicies and client-relationship model. There is a need to really get to know\nthe underlying identity of the acquired organisational system, its timeline,\nthe critical events that have shaped its identity, the underlying dynamics\ncurrently at play. Taking the time to hear their stories will accelerate the\nintegration process afterwards.\n\nEven when a cultural compatibility assessment has been part of the due\ndiligence phase, it often stays on the surface and does not uncover the deeper\nsystemic dynamics that will show up in the integration phase and might\njeopardise integration success.\n\nThe systemic principles listed below can be used as a lens to look at both\nplayers \u2013 the acquirer and the acquired - and understand the cultural identity\nand dynamics on a deeper level.\n\nAs a result, the future desired culture can begin to take shape, not as a copy\nof the dominant culture, not as a half-hearted compromise between both, but as\nthe one that fits the new combined organisational system.\n\n  * Purpose\n\nWhat was our/their founding story?\n\nWhat is our/their current purpose, the reason to exist? What is society\ninviting us/them to do?\n\nWhat are our/their guiding principles?\n\nWhich events on our timeline have shaped our/their identity?\n\n  * Connection\n\nWhat is our/their narrative that connects all stakeholders to that purpose,\nthat engages them in a dream, in a story, in a new reality?\n\nWhat is our/their vision, the one that comes with personal commitment and\ntough choices\n\n  * Inclusion\n\nWho belongs to our/their organisational system? What does it take to belong?\n\nWhat is our/their organisational design and how is it tailored to the purpose?\n\nWhat has made us/them successful? It might be because of a specific agile org\nchart or highly connected relationship structure\n\nWhere did we deviate from what the optimal organisational structure would be?\n\n  * Order\n\nWhat are our/their (often unspoken) criteria to define order in decision\nmaking? It might be based on job titles, levels, tenure or nationality, on\ncontribution to innovation, outside perspective and job rotation.\n\n  * Exchange\n\nHow is our/their company\u2019s vitality?\n\nIs there flow, energy, rumble, creative conflict, diversity of thought? A high\nlevel of trust, cross-fertilisation beyond the company gates?\n\nWhat has been the cost of change, and who paid the price?\n\nThese are some examples of the systemic questions to be asked. As you are\ninviting honest dialogues about those questions and jointly uncover the real\nanswers, you can bring to the surface the roots of persistent cultural\nroadblocks and consciously build the new, leading to a smoother, faster and\nmore successful integration, engaged employees who connect quickly to the new\nidentity and a value- and purpose-based culture that fosters innovation,\ncreativity and a mindset of continuous improvement and transformation.\n\n[![](https://workplaceinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mieke-Jacobs-and-\nPaul-Zonneveld.jpg)](https://workplaceinsight.net/author/mieke-jacobs-and-\npaul-zonneveld/)\n\n[Mieke

July, four business and client units will report to CEO Loh Boon\nChye.\n\nThe Singapore Exchange (SGX) has formed a new organisation structure to pursue\ngrowth opportunities and build scale in multiple asset classes, an\nannouncement revealed.\n\nEffective 1 July, four business and client units, comprising fixed income,\ncurrencies and commodities (FICC), equities (cash & derivatives), data,\nconnectivity and indices (DCI), and global sales and origination (GSO), will\nreport to the CEO.\n\nOver the last decade, the FICC businesses in SGX has reportedly been on a path\nof considerable growth, emerging as a sizable set of asset classes and that\nwill now be combined to form a new business unit.\n\n\"The rising convergence of over-the-counter (OTC) and listed foreign exchange\n(FX) markets, coupled with our standing as Asia's fastest growing and largest\nAsian FX Futures venue, presents us with opportunities to serve the market\nwith innovative and differentiated products,\" the local bourse said.\n\n**Also read:**  [SGX to launch new securities settlement and depository\nsystem](https://sbr.com.sg/markets-investing/news/sgx-launch-new-securities-\nsettlement-and-depository-system)\n\nIn commodities, SGX said that it plans to deepen its leading position in Asian\nindustrial commodities and continue to drive synergies between global trade\nand transport marketplaces. As a result, Baltic Exchange and Energy Market\nCompany (EMC), both wholly-owned subsidiaries of SGX, will report into FICC as\nimportant anchors to the physical market in the commodities value chain.\n\nThe unit will be led by Lee Beng Hong, who will be joining SGX on 1 August. In\nthe interim, the CEO will have oversight of the unit.\n\nMeanwhile, SGX's cash equities and equity derivatives businesses will merge to\nform an enlarged platform where retail and institutional clients can access a\ncontinuum of equities products, including all trading, clearing, post-trade\nand research services.\n\n\"By focusing on equities as a single asset class, product and service\ninnovation can span both cash and derivatives channels to address client needs\nholistically,\" the local bourse said, adding that Michael Syn, currently head\nof derivatives, has been appointed as the head of equities.\n\nThe bourse's market data & connectivity unit has been renamed data,\nconnectivity and indices (DCI) to better reflect SGX's full suite of data-\nrelated product and services. Ng Kin Yee will continue to lead DCI.\n\nThe GSO unit combines the equities and debt capital market teams with SGX's\nnine international offices and specialist sales teams. Chew Sutat, currently\nhead of equities & fixed income, will head GSO.\n\n\"These changes will further SGX's future growth as a leading international\nexchange, fluent in multiple asset classes,\" SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye said.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate announcement revealed that Muthukrishnan Ramaswami will\nstep down as the SGX's president after 12 years with the local bourse. As a\nmember of the executive management committee of SGX, Ramaswami had direct\noversight of technology, operations, market data and connectivity, as well as\nthe membership and international coverage functions of the SGX group.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement. [Find out more about the webinars\n\u00bb](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\n\n### _Among others,_ Catherine Low, Country Manager of ING in Singapore _,\naffirms to_ Jerene Ang _that servant leadership can make a positive\ndifference, even though the contribution of such leadership is usually not\nhighly visible to others._\n\n**Q How would you describe your journey with ING so far? What has been your\nmost memorable moment with the organisation?**\n\nAfter fifteen-plus years with ING, I am still learning new things every day.\nING gives a lot of freedom and support to employees to chart their personal\ndevelopment, especially for employees who take personal responsibility for\ntheir own learning and development. For example, I have been given the\nopportunity to move from a specialised lending function in trade and commodity\nfinancing, to a general management role as the Singapore Country Manager.\n\nWhat I also appreciate about ING is its diverse and international mix of\nemployees, and the relatively flat organisation structure that recognises the\nvalue of employee contribution apart from a hierarchical role. For example, in\n2014-2017, I was appointed to the bank\u2019s global leadership council despite the\nfact that I was not the most senior employee in Asia in terms of hierarchy.\n\n**Q How would you define your leadership style?**\n\nI believe in servant leadership, and hope to keep growing as one. The needs of\nemployees \u2013 to perform, grow professionally, and find fulfilment and meaning\nin their job scope and job environment \u2013 are put ahead of quid pro quo\nconsiderations or even the leader's own self-interest. A servant leader does\nnot manage from a position of power or authority, but uses influence to\nfacilitate and serve, and to allow others to shine.\n\nMany people confuse service with servitude or subservience. Serving that is\npurely driven out of the primary desire to help others, if combined with\nleadership skills, can make a positive difference, even though the\ncontribution of such servant leadership is usually not highly visible to\nothers.\n\n**Q When you\u2019re struggling with stress or a bad day, how do you unwind and re-\nenergise yourself?**\n\nA few years ago I went through a period of illness. Having emerged from that,\nwith a much deeper appreciation for health and relationships and my personal\nfaith, work troubles no longer become mountains in my mind. I am blessed to\nhave a group of caring friends and trusted colleagues with whom I can talk\nabout the issues I am facing, or turn to for help and advice.\n\n**Q Having been in the banking sector for more than 20 years, how have you\nseen the industry evolve from a talent standpoint? Do you find the oft-cited\ngender diversity imbalance in the sector improving?**\n\nGender diversity has certainly improved in the area of corporate banking. When\nI first became a corporate banker in the \u201890s, my manager told me that the\nability to entertain clients over meals, karaoke, drinks, or to play golf were\nconsidered as strengths.\n\nAs a woman with family commitments, I challenged my manager to let me develop\nmy own client portfolio based on the ability to deliver products and services\nwell to the corporates, rather than having to entertain individuals within\nthose corporates outside of office hours.\n\nMy corporate client portfolio grew rapidly, and I believe that I was one of\nthe pioneers in the then male-dominated commodity trade financing industry who\nshowed that females can become senior bankers.\n\n**Q What do you think organisations can do to empower more women leaders like\nyourself?**\n\nMany organisations already dedicate resources to building and maintaining\ndiversity, including gender diversity. Yet gender diversity is still not at\nideal levels at very senior levels. This may require intentional intervention\nin the beginning, such as targeted sponsorship of high potential female talent\nto ensure a robust pipeline for key senior positions. I believe that once\nthere are more female role models at key positions, there will be a natural\nvirtuous snowball effect.\n\n**Q What is your view of human resources as a business function? How closely\ndo you work with your HR head and on what kind of issues?**\n\nHuman capital is key for organisations, hence the importance of human\nresources as a business function. A dollar of financial capital is the same\ndollar everywhere, and how it is deployed determines the return on that\ncapital.\n\nHowever, every employee is different, how they are enabled and developed\ndetermines how well financial capital is used to generate economic and social\nbenefits for all stakeholders. Any business leader will have to work closely\nwith HR as a business partner in the different areas of recruitment, learning\nand development, compensation and performance management.\n\n**Q Describe your ideal CHRO.**\n\nAn ideal CHRO is forward-thinking, and goes beyond running a well-oiled\nadministration function to being a business partner who can attract, retain\nand build talent according to the strategic long-term requirements of the\norganisation.\n\n**Q If not this career, what alternative career path might you have chosen?**\n\nDespite being in banking for so long, I don't feel that I am in one career\npath, because the learning experience along my personal journey has been so\nvaried, and there is so much to learn from and contribute to, every day. This\nis why I have not actively considered other careers so far.\n\n_Photo / provided_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

balance; Hello, work-life harmony\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n### _We 've all heard about work-life balance, but what do we know about work-\nlife harmony and its importance in today's workforce? To find out, _Priya\nSunil _interviews a wide range of stakeholders \u2013 from MDs to HR directors,\nline managers, working parents and Millennials \u2013 for their take on what\nintegrating work and life really means._\n\nLook around you and ask someone what work-life balance means to them, and\nthey\u2019ll think about achieving balance between their work and life\nresponsibilities.\n\nThat said, employers are increasingly phasing out 'balance', in favour of\nintegration, or even 'harmony', defined by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair\nand Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) as: \"A state in which an\nindividual is able to achieve both personal and professional goals in a\ncombination that is uniquely satisfactory.\"\n\nIn line with this, _Human Resources Online_ decided to delve into what this\nreally means \u2013 not just to employers and line managers who have to implement\npolicies that support this concept, but also to Millennials and working\nparents who are benefitting from these policies.\n\nAfter all, these two demographics are taking up more places in today\u2019s\nworkforce and will continue to grow in importance.\n\nHence, in this feature, we present the views of four demographics \u2013 employers,\nline managers, Millennials and working parents, in two separate organisations\n\u2013 to present you with a holistic viewpoint. Before that, to get the ball\nrolling, we share with you some of the key findings of a wide-ranging survey\non the work-life landscape in Singapore.\n\n* * *\n\n### Evolution of the work-life landscape in Singapore\n\nThe Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP),\nin collaboration with The Straits Times, conducted a survey on work-life\nharmony and flexible work arrangements (FWAs). The survey results, released in\nJune, captured the responses of 511 employers and 1,000 employees.\n\nThis survey, which was first conducted in 2014, aimed to understand the\ncurrent state of work-life harmony in Singapore, the challenges of\nimplementation, and to gain insights of views and concerns of both employers\nand employees.\n\n### What has changed in the past five years?\n\nAn ageing and shrinking population is having an impact on the workforce.\n\n> ##### Juggling work responsibilities while managing caregiving duties of\n> both children and ageing parents can take a toll on the 'sandwiched'\n> generation in the workforce.\n\nMany of them rely on external resources for support such as childcare centres\nfor their children, or senior centres for their parents, due to fewer or no\nsiblings to share the responsibilities with.\n\nMeanwhile, extended families have also shrunk, further straining alternative\ncaregiving resources.\n\nThe multiple responsibilities, as an employee, parent and child, will also\nintensify time stress and possibly increase mental, emotional and financial\npressures as well. All these can lead to burnout if not managed properly.\n\nThese factors point towards a much greater need for work-life harmony among\nemployees today. As all employees juggle multiple roles, their needs cut\nacross different age groups, genders and life and career stages.\n\n_Note: Work-life harmony is defined as a state in which an individual is able\nto achieve both personal and professional goals in a combination that is\nuniquely satisfactory. This differs across individuals as different people\nhave different needs, responsibilities, values and priorities._\n\n### What are the key findings from the survey?\n\n**Shift 1: Work-life programmes are being implemented more strategically and\nformally, resulting in greater alignment between employers and employees.**\n\nEmployers are increasingly recognising the value of work-life programmes in\nmanaging manpower needs \u2013 82% agreed they enhanced their company image and 80%\nagreed they were important in attracting and recruiting top talent, up from\n68% and 74% respectively in 2014.\n\nThe survey also showed a shift towards formal channels in communicating\navailable work-life programmes to the organisation, suggesting that policies\nand practices are becoming more structured and formalised.\n\n![chart1](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/09102636/chart1-700x519.png)\n\n\n\nThese shifts have resulted in employers and employees being more aligned in\ntheir views towards work-life harmony.\n\nThe survey revealed that 83% of employers, up from 80% in 2014, believed that\nemployees should have the flexibility to manage their time and schedule as\nlong as they were able to meet work targets, converging with 82% of employees,\nup from 76% in 2014, who believed their supervisor provided them the\nflexibility to do so.\n\n**Shift 2: Middle managers recognise their role as facilitators**\n\nThe results showed that a growing proportion of supervisors are beginning to\nunderstand and accept the role they play in facilitating the organisation\u2019s\nwork-life strategy. In fact, 72%, up from 64% in 2014, saw it as their\nresponsibility to ensure their employees achieve work-life harmony.\n\nMeanwhile, 81% of supervisors were aligned with the organisation's\ncommunicated policy on work-life harmony, up from 68% in 2014. Their increased\nsupport is felt by employees, where 'support from supervisors' was highlighted\nas the top key enabler that helped employees achieve good work-life harmony.\n\nWith the implementation of FWAs becoming more prevalent among workplaces\ntoday, supervisors are managing teams who may be on a combination of flexible\nwork arrangements within their team, resulting in greater operational\nconcerns. Supervisors were concerned about equity in workload in their team\nwhen a team member requests to be on a flexible work arrangement.\n\nNotably, the percentage of supervisors who were concerned that employees were\nnot getting his or her job done fell from 56% to 28%, which indicates that\nsupervisors might be putting in place more effective ways to measure\nperformance.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/09102756/chart-3.png) ![chart-2](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/09102747/chart-2.png)\n\n\n\n**Shift 3: A more inclusive approach in work-life strategies**\n\nOrganisations are adopting a more inclusive approach towards employees. While\nworking mothers with young children continue to be key beneficiaries, working\nfathers with young children are now utilising FWAs as much as working mothers\nwith young children, and are expressing their need for work-life harmony. They\nare not afraid to highlight the value and impact a pro work-life organisation\nhas on them.\n\nA significantly larger proportion of them also leverage on FWAs, such as\nstaggered start and end times (34% in 2018, up from 15% in 2014) and\ntelecommuting (26% in 2018, up from 15% in 2014).\n\nWorking mothers with young children continue to receive strong support \u2013 82%,\nup from 69% in 2014, agreed their supervisor provides them with the\nflexibility to manage their own time and schedule as long as work targets and\ndeadlines are met, and 78%, up from 66% in 2014, feel their supervisor is open\ntowards FWAs when required.\n\nAs dual income families in Singapore become more common, both genders\nincreasingly have to deal with the interests of both work and family. An\nequilibrium in parenting, where both father and mother are actively involved\nin parenting, has strengthened the need for work-life harmony, regardless of\ngender.\n\n**Shift 4: FWAs as a sustainable option**\n\nFWAs have been recognised as a means to manage employee work-life needs more\nsustainably, as indicated by an increase in the provision of FWAs and a drop\nin leave benefits in TAFEP's survey results.\n\nThere seems to be a growing understanding that some work-life needs,\nespecially those that are longer term or life-stage related, can be more\nsustainably managed through the use of FWAs. For example, providing an\nemployee with the flexibility at work to deal with regular or chronic medical\nneeds of a family member is likely to be more effective in the long-run, as\nopposed to a day\u2019s leave or a few hours off intermittently.\n\nThese findings are validated by the employee respondents themselves, who\nranked FWAs as more beneficial than leave benefits. Likewise, the results\nshowed an increase in the utilisation of FWAs and a decrease in the\nutilisation of leave benefits.\n\nAnd it seems organisations are moving in the right direction, as the results\nshowed that employees with various caregiving needs expressed greater\nsatisfaction with work-life programmes provided by their organisation.\n\n![chart-6](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/09103007/chart-6.png)\n\n\n\n### What does this mean for Singapore\u2019s workforce?\n\nThe changing employment and demographic landscape calls for new perspectives\nand a change of mindset from the way we approached work-life harmony before.\n\nAs the need for work-life harmony becomes increasingly urgent, the importance\nof work-life programmes cannot be understated.\n\nWhen used strategically, it becomes a powerful and effective attraction,\nretention and engagement tool that enables you to facilitate employees\u2019 needs\nthrough different life stages, regardless of age, gender or stage of their\ncareer. Only then can we remain agile and thrive in the ever-changing\nemployment landscape.\n\n* * *\n\n## [Moving ahead with flexibility: Go-Ahead\nSingapore](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-go-ahead-\nsingapore-moves-forward-with-flexibility-for-employees/)\n\nAt public transport operator Go-Ahead Singapore, employees are offered the\nflexibility to choose a work schedule that best suits them. **Wang Poon Liang,\nHuman Resources Director** , who represents the employer\u2019s demographic, has\nobserved that having such an arrangement in place has positively impacted\nemployees\u2019 lives and attitudes towards work and the company.\n\nOne such employee is **Jane Lim, Senior HR Officer** , who once had to take\ncare of her critically ill father, and most recently, her newborn son. In\nthose days, Go-Ahead Singapore had standard working hours and due to the\ninflexibility of this, Lim was constantly faced with the challenges of being\nthere for her father, and son, while committing to work as well.\n\nHowever, with the flexible work scheme in place, Lim, who represents the\nworking parent's demographic, is now finally able to successfully fulfil her\nduties at home and in the office.\n\nShe shares: \"For example, I have the option of reporting to work later and\nmaking up for it by ending work later in the evening to tend to my son\u2019s needs\nwhen necessary. I was also able to be there for my late father when he needed\nme and ensured that he always had someone present to look after him.\"\n\nLike Lim, **Michelle Ng, Senior Executive, Marketing & Communications**, is\nalso able to better plan her schedule with the new scheme.\n\nShe comments: \"I find myself being more productive when I come into the office\nearlier and I can plan out my daily tasks better. This helps to free up more\ntime after work to have an evening meal with family members or pursue a\npassion that I am interested in.\"\n\nWeighing in on the impact of the scheme on employees such as Lim and Ng,\n**Human Resources Manager Maggie Shek** , who represents the line manager\u2019s\ndemographic, says employees do feel positive about the company being\nunderstanding and flexible towards their personal needs, allowing them to\nfocus and give their all at work.\n\nIn turn, the company has been able to successfully retain talent within and\nattract new candidates to join the company.\n\n\"From the reduction in staff turnover, we achieved effectiveness in cost and\nresource. It is a win-win situation as it allows us to remain competitive in\nthe industry with a sustained and dedicated workforce,\" says Shek.\n\nHaving said that, with every new implementation comes its own set of concerns\n\u2013 in this case, when Go-Ahead Singapore first embarked on this flexible work\nscheme, some managers were not used to their team members adopting different\nwork hours and feared losing control over managing their team. Employees also\nstarted raising concerns about being penalised for leaving work earlier.\n\nAddressing these issues did take the leadership team some time, as Wang\nshares, but he stresses:\n\n> ##### Our appraisal system is an objective-based evaluation, measuring the\n> quality of work and achievements of an individual instead of the amount of\n> face time in the office.\n\nThis has, as a result, helped alleviate some of the fears.\n\nThe flexible working scheme aside, Go-Ahead Singapore also makes it a point to\nencourage work-life harmony by organising wellness activities such as brisk\nwalks, sports interest groups, and festival celebrations to foster a community\nspirit. There is also a part-time work scheme in the works, catered to\nemployees who have reached retirement age, but are still fit enough and\ninterested in working.\n\nGoing forward, Wang says the company plans to introduce the option to work\nfrom home \"progressively and whenever possible\", although he admits it may not\nbe applicable to all job scopes.\n\nApart from that, Lim and Ng share their wish list for the top three work-life\nprogrammes that could help employers attract and retain the different\ngenerations, and working parents in today\u2019s workforce.\n\nFirst, Ng, who represents the Millennial\u2019s demographic, suggests the concept\nof telecommuting, which would allow employees to work in a remote location and\nconnect with their teammates over communication technologies.\n\nShe says: \"It is not to be assumed the employee does not want to be in the\nwork environment, but rather, provided as an available option on a situational\nor regular basis. The employee can be made known of his or her role in\nensuring a workable telecommuting arrangement.\"\n\nThis way, she adds, employees are able to retain more time in their day,\ninstead of spending it commuting, while also choosing how to be at their most\nproductive.\n\nNext, Lim \"strongly believes\" a compressed work-week arrangement would be\nbeneficial to employees with varied responsibilities, such as working mothers\nlike herself. In such an arrangement, employees work full-time hours in fewer\ndays a week, freeing up one or more days for other non work-related\nactivities.\n\nShe adds: \"What a respite this would be, especially for employees juggling\nmultiple roles.\n\n> ##### I know this would save me some dilemma when my child\u2019s vaccinations\n> need to be scheduled, schools are closed or simply for a family day out!\n\n## [Delivering a culture of output over input:\nfoodpanda](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-foodpanda-is-\novercoming-the-matter-of-people-working-systematically-long-hours/)\n\nOver at foodpanda, the on-demand international food delivery service,\n**Managing Director, Luc Andreani** , who represents the employer\u2019s\ndemographic, believes that in the company\u2019s fast-paced tech/e-commerce\nenvironment, it is crucial to have the right measures to ensure employees\nachieve a balance between their work and personal lives.\n\nIf not, they are at risk of experiencing burnout and the company could\npotentially lose its best employees.\n\nIn line with that, the company has implemented a series of initiatives. It\noffers benefits such as flexible working hours and two days of work-from-home\nper month.\n\nHe shares: \"What we are proud of is that these benefits do not just apply to\nfull-timers, but are also available to part-timers and interns. Beyond that,\nwe also organise interdepartmental team bonding activities to encourage\nemployees who usually wouldn\u2019t work together to get to know each other.\"\n\nFurther, employees tenured for more than a year are entitled to courses under\nits 'Panda Learns' programme, which are paid for by the company.\n\n**HR Manager Sri Hadisti** , who represents the line manager\u2019s demographic,\nnotes the importance of such initiatives, as they prioritise work-life balance\nas one of the key ways to improve organisational productivity, competitive\nadvantage, morale and even efficiency.\n\nShe adds: \"With the right strategies in place, employees will be able to enjoy\nan enhanced sense of job satisfaction and increased motivation at work. This,\nin turn, will translate into creating a workplace environment that your\nemployees enjoy coming into, and strengthening their loyalty and commitment to\nthe organisation.\"\n\nHowever, maintaining work-life harmony hasn\u2019t always been easy for staff. Take\n**Darryl Chua, Regional Operations Manager** , for example, who represents the\nMillennial\u2019s demographic. In the past, he faced challenges managing the\nexpectations of different stakeholders, which in turn, took a toll on his mood\nand ultimately affected his work performance.\n\n\"It took me a while before I realised that there was nothing wrong in asking\nfor help or advice when managing my workload or when I feel like my personal\nneeds are also being affected, as it will ultimately affect my work as well.\nThis a vicious cycle that is not easy to break out off, but acknowledging it\nand getting the right advice is key,\" he says.\n\nIn such cases, he reinforces the importance of being more involved in the\nprogrammes, and leading by example. He explains:\n\n> ##### Even when a company might have a good programme in place, it will fall\n> through because the managers are not adopting it or playing an active role\n> in it, even though they are encouraging the employees to do so.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t send across the right message that it\u2019s OK for more junior staff\nto take part in these initiatives.\"\n\nTalking about the priorities ahead, Andreani says the company is looking to\novercome the matter of people working \"systematically long hours\". In order to\naddress this, the team has identified two root causes \u2013 employee inefficiency\nand organisational inefficiency, with the former being an immediate priority.\n\nFor tackling employee inefficiency, foodpanda is planning to put in place\ntime-management training for all employees, not just for individuals that\nmight be facing this issue.\n\n\"You\u2019ll never know when you might feel overwhelmed at work and we want to make\nsure that our team has the resources to make them feel empowered at what they\nare doing,\" he explains.\n\nThe company has also done away with employees having to clock-in or out,\nremoving unnecessary stress on employees.\n\nAs for organisational inefficiency, he foresees a slightly longer period for\nchanges to take effect, but the team is nonetheless committed to making them.\nFor a start, the leadership team has made it a point to expand the tech team\nin anticipation of the support needed for the six to 12 months ahead \u2013 a\nstrategy that it is looking to apply to all teams.\n\nLast, he shares that the company is also inculcating an office culture that\nvalues output more than input, or hours, so as to focus on results rather than\nthe amount of time taken to achieve that desired result.\n\nThrough these conversations, it is apparent that work-life harmony can be\nachieved in many ways, but not through a one-size-fits-all policy.\n\nIn fact, these policies should be tailored to both the organisation\u2019s and\noverall employees' needs.\n\nFlexibility is also favoured across the board, and ultimately, it cannot be\nstressed further that at the end of the day, with each implementation, it all\nboils down to output over input \u2013 the quality of work produced, over the\nnumber of hours clocked in.\n\n* * *\n\n[![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/09101702/Priya-Sept-2019-Aug-feature-\nconversations-1-screengrab-resized-330x198.jpg)](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/09101702/Priya-Sept-2019-Aug-feature-\nconversations-1-screengrab-resized.jpg)\n\n[![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/09101707/Priya-Sept-2019-Aug-feature-\nconversations-2-screengrab-resized-330x198.jpg)](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/09101707/Priya-Sept-2019-Aug-feature-\nconversations-2-screengrab-resized.jpg)\n\n  \n\n_Both foodpanda and Go-Ahead Singapore are adopters of the Tripartite\nStandards (TS).

This has\nresulted in a shift in focus, meaning that local companies must themselves\nshift from compliance to accountability in the management of personal data.\n\nSingapore's HR managers must make their senior management aware of their\naccountability and the increased risk that data breaches pose.\n\n**Management of employee data through the full lifecycle**  \nPersonal data includes any information that can identify a specific\nindividual, be it via their full name, their National Registration Identity\nCard (NRIC) number, passport, personal mobile number, fingerprints, and so on.\n\nFor HR professionals, it is important to note that information relating to\nfailed job applicants is just as sensitive as that of employees and is equally\nprotected under the PDPA. Companies must have clear written policies on the\nretention and destruction of job applicant information - an element often\noverlooked in policy documents. Companies must fulfil nine key obligations\nunder the PDPA:\n\n  1. Consent of the individual must be obtained before collecting personal data. As resumes are provided directly by applicants, consent can be assumed but they should not be retained for a prolonged period if the application has failed.\n  2. Personal information must only be used for reasonable and appropriate purposes.\n  3. A company must notify the employee of the reason for collecting personal data.\n  4. The company must, upon request, provide the individual access to any personal data held about them and how it has been used or disclosed for the past year. It must be possible for the employee to have inaccuracies corrected.\n  5. Reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that the personal data collected is accurate and complete. This is especially so if a decision is to be made about the employee based on the personal data.\n  6. All reasonable measures need to be put in place to ensure that personal data is held securely to prevent unauthorised access.\n  7. Personal data must only be retained for as long as it is properly required for legal or business purposes.\n  8. Before personal data is transferred out of Singapore, measures must be put in place to ensure that the receiving organisation will protect the personal data to the same standards used in Singapore.\n  9. A company must have documented policies and procedures concerning its implementation of the PDPA, including the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO), whose contact information must be publicly available.\n\nHR departments should always be located in secure areas, with clear desk\npolicies. Documents containing personal data must be kept securely and only\ndisclosed to those who require access for business purposes. This includes\nsensitive payroll data that may be held in payroll departments.\n\nFor organisations that are moving HR & payroll operations to managed service\nproviders, it is critical to only provide necessary data to the service\nprovider. Additionally, organisations should note that the accountability and\nownership of the personal data remains with them.\n\nOn 15 January 2019, PDPC imposed a financial penalty on Singhealth following a\ncyberattack incident and stated, \"Even if organisations delegate work to\nvendors, organisations as data controllers must ultimately take responsibility\nfor the personal data that they have collected from their customers.\"\n\nAll computer-held data must be secure and only accessible on a need-to-know\nbasis. Systems must be monitored to be certain controls have not been\ncompromised.\n\nHR professionals must be fully aware of the new regulations concerning the use\nof an individual's NRIC that will be effective from 1 September 2019. The\nNRIC, which includes NRIC numbers, passport numbers, birth certificate\nnumbers, foreign identification numbers and work permit numbers, should only\nbe collected or retained if required under the law and there is a need to\nconfirm the identity to a high degree of fidelity. NRIC of visitors to a\nbuilding should not be retained or printed on ID badges. Even if there is a\nneed to collect NRIC numbers, it is highly recommended to only collect a\nredacted portion, namely the last 3 digits and the letters.\n\n**Evaluation and monitoring of employee behaviour**  \nThe PDPA allows for the monitoring of employees to determine their\nsuitability, eligibility and qualifications for appointment, promotion,\ncontinuance in office and removal from their position.\n\nA company can collect, use and disclose evaluative data without the consent of\nthe individual. This can include monitoring an employee's emails and their use\nof computer network resources.\n\nWhilst consent is not required, the organisation should notify employees by\nstating that they do perform such monitoring in the employee handbook or other\npolicy document.\n\n**HR best practice and governance**  \nBest practice policies and procedures need to be documented and implemented.\nThese should include:\n\n  1. Don't request submission of an individual's NRIC in the recruitment process until they accept the position.\n  2. Only retain failed applicant resumes for a short period; dispose of them securely.\n  3. Seek consent before redirecting a resume for a different role from the one applied for; state on recruitment postings that the organisation will consider all applicants for alternative positions.\n  4. Only transfer personal data outside of Singapore if necessary, have measures in place to protect the personal data to the same standard as in Singapore and obtain the individual's consent in advance.\n  5. Have clear policies on retaining ex-employees' personal data and its destruction.\n  6. Inform employees if emails, computer usage and telephones are monitored and why.\n  7. If not already in place, a DPO must be appointed and their contact details made public.\n  8. Management of employee data should only be entrusted to an accredited partner to prevent data leakage in the workplace. In the HR and payroll services industry, accreditations and compliance programmes that you should look for include International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3402, ISO 27001 - the standard for information security management systems and the ISAE 3402/SOC 1 report for payroll services, to provide the standard of data security and information management that you need.\n\nMore than ever before, the board of directors must take an active part in\nprotecting the reputation of their business and properly fund the protection\nof personal data of employees and customers alike.\n\n**Next steps**  \nHR professionals must understand the full scope of the PDPA and review current\npolicies and procedures and strengthen them where necessary to achieve\ncompliance.\n\nThey need to make senior management aware of the importance of compliance with\nthe policies and where responsibility will be deemed to lie. If in any doubt\non how to fully comply, HR management should consider seeking professional\nadvice from local experts.\n\n**_The views expressed in this column are the author 's own and do not\nnecessarily reflect this publication's view, and this article is not edited by\nSingapore Business Review.

The departures could add\nto questions of whether WeWork can keep its own labor-intensive house in order\nas it tries to raise several billion dollars in a public offering as soon as\nnext month.\u201d\n\nSome may be quick to dismiss this as just a Human Resources problem. But one\nof the most telling ways to assess how a company is doing is not its financial\nperformance but the state of its people. Employees are the lifeblood of a\ncompany and their contentment is a leading indicator of the health of a\ncompany. Employees have a front row seat to the company\u2019s operation. When\nemployees begin to flee, interested observers should take heed of trouble\nahead.\n\nMany of its recent initiatives and organizational practices that have emerged\nover the last few months and weeks have raised questions about its internal\ndecision-making and how effectively the company is run.\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\n **1\\. Neumann\u2019s Employment Agreement**\n\nFor a start, Founder Adam Neumann\u2015we learned in WeWork\u2019s\n[prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1533523/000119312519220499/d781982ds1.htm#toc781982_10)\u2015is\nnot under an employment contract with the company:\n\n_\u201cAdam [Neumann] has been key to setting our vision, strategic direction and\nexecution priorities. We have no employment agreement in place with Adam, and\nthere can be no assurance that Adam will continue to work for us or serve our\ninterests in any capacity. If Adam does not continue to serve as our Chief\nExecutive Officer, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\u201d_\n\nAn employment agreement may sound like legalese but it is an important\nequalizer in the firm. No employee, including the CEO, should be exempt from\nhaving an employment agreement.\n\nArguably, as one of the most important roles in a company, the CEO should be\nthe _first_ to enter into an agreement. No company should face the risk of a\nCEO being able to walk out overnight without any strings attached. Even if an\nemployee is under an at-will employee contract, meaning they can leave or be\nterminated at any time, the employee usually feels an obligation to smooth any\ntransition in large part because they are under a binding agreement to provide\nat least two weeks notice if not longer.\n\nAn employment agreement also usually bars the employee from conducting\nactivity that could hurt the firm. And some of Neumann\u2019s initiatives, namely\nthe practice of leasing his own buildings back to the firm or selling the name\n\"We\" to the firm for $5.9 million, do raise questions about the ethical\nviability of those actions. Was it really beneficial for the firm? Was it\nbenefiting the founder more than the firm?\n\n**2\\. WeWork\u2019s Organizational Structure**\n\nThe prospectus also lays out a \u201csimplified\u201d organizational structure. Please\nhave a look at it below.  \n\n![uncaptioned](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5d69d66068cb0a0008c0f53e/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nFrankly, it looks more like a [Kandinsky\npainting](https://www.wikiart.org/en/wassily-kandinsky/composition-viii-1923)\nthan anything resembling a legible organizational structure.\n\nAn organizational structure is supposed to indicate how a company is\nstructured from a reporting standpoint and sometimes from an operational\nstandpoint, although not always. It is usually a good indicator of where\ninformation sits within an organization and how that information tends to\nflow. But with such a convoluted structure, it is very likely that in\npractice, the operational effectiveness of that flow is flawed.\n\nAnd if this is the simplified version, I\u2019d be worried to see the real thing.\n\n**3\\. \u201cThe We Company\u201d Rebrand**\n\nA rebrand can kill a company from the inside and out. I would know. Having\nworked at Booz & Company, which then rebranded to Strategy& after being\nacquired by PwC, the rebrand became an internal and external pain point.\nEmployee buy-in was low and clients had a hard time understanding how to even\npronounce it.\n\nShakespeare might have said: \u201cWhat\u2019s in a name? That which we call a rose by\nany other name would smell as sweet.\u201d\n\nBut in business, a rose with a branding problem will only wither away. From a\nbranding point of view, renaming the company to \u201cWe\u201d has proved to be an un-\nneeded marketing obstacle. A testament to indicate the magnitude of the\nchallenge, is how most articles reporting on its prospectus have continued to\nrefer to the company as WeWork, not \u201cThe We Company.\u201d\n\nWhen WeWork changed its name to We, I remember reading a great post by Matt\nLevine from Bloomberg Businessweek who hit on exactly how ineffective and eery\nthe new name would be:\n\n\"Me [Levine]: What does your company do?\n\nWe: We encompass all aspects of your life, in both physical and digital\nworlds.\n\nMe: Wait that\u2019s terrifying.\n\nWe: We\u2019re like Facebook, only you also live here.\n\nMe: Who did you say you are again?\n\nWe: We are We.\"\n\nBranding aside, it takes a level of presumption to name a company the pronoun\n\u201cWe.\u201d It questions how tethered the company is to its position in the market\nthat it wouldn\u2019t recognize the backlash it would trigger.\n\nThese data points are not definitive, but they do paint a picture of a company\nthat has organizational and positioning kinks to work out. The company claims\nits mission is to \u201celevate the world\u2019s consciousness,\u201d but in the process it\nmay have accidentally floated too far off the ground, untethering itself to\nreality.\n\nA last peripheral point worth mentioning, especially as a woman, is a remark\nmade by Rebekah Neumann, the Chief Brand and Impact Officer at WeWork and also\nAdam Neumann\u2019s wife. She was quoted as saying: \u201cA big part of being a woman is\nto help men manifest their calling in life.\u201d\n\nAfter the quote circulated widely on the internet and received understandable\nbacklash, the company released another of her quotes, which didn\u2019t do much to\nappease any concerns:\n\n\u201cThe reality that I see today is that there is nothing bigger that women can\ndo, in my opinion, than empower their partners \u2014 and that can be a man, a\nwoman, a friend, it doesn\u2019t matter, but empower others.\u201d\n\nAnd while I wholeheartedly believe women _and_ men should devote time to\nsupporting others, I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s equivocal to devoting your life to\nhelping someone else manifest their vision at the expense of your own. After\nall, she holds a C-level position in the company. The Chief Brand Officer\nisn\u2019t to blindly execute on the CEO\u2019s vision but to have the most accurate\npulse of how the company is trending with its current and potential customer\nbase.  \n\nAnd this is but one small example of the biggest risk in WeWork\u2019s future. To\nsecure its future, a company can\u2019t look up at a CEO and down at its customers\nand employees. The companies with the brightest futures always see eye-to-eye.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/stephdenning).\n\n[![Stephanie Denning](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/stephaniedenning/files/2018/10/Stephanie-\nDenning_avatar_1539616442.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniedenning/\n\"Photo of Stephanie Denning\")\n\n[Stephanie Denning](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniedenning/)\n\nMy writing explores the choices firms and leaders make and the impact of those\nchoices.

digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\nWhen a company culture embraces risk and builds strong interpersonal skills,\nemployees are more engaged. This leads to better products, services, and\nexperiences for customers, a new global study has revealed.\n\nTitled [_The Emotional Intelligence (EI)\nAdvantage_](https://hbr.org/sponsored/2019/08/the-ei-advantage-driving-\ninnovation-and-business-success-through-the-power-of-emotional-intelligence),\nthe study was conducted by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services and\npresented by Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and showcased the importance of\nEI as a \"must-have\" driver in company cultures today.\n\nThis is due to the growing influence of the Millennial workforce today, and of\nemployees increasingly desiring a sense of inclusion and personal meaning\nbehind their work.\n\nIn fact, it was found that when a company has a well-embedded EI capability\ntogether with a sense of purpose, it not only drives employee success, but\nalso job satisfaction.\n\n![Priya-August-2019-HBR-AS-survey-chart-figure-6-screengrab](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/16114900/Priya-August-2019-HBR-AS-survey-chart-\nfigure-6-screengrab-700x347.jpg)\n\n###### **_Note: The report segregated organisations into three categories -\nthe perceptives (organisations who felt strongly about EI), the detached\n(those who were disconnected), and the uncommitted (organisations that were\nneutral about it)._**\n\nWhile this is so, although nearly 70% of organisations involved do measure\nemployee satisfaction, just 10% make it a point to assess company-wide EI\nskills.\n\n### Integrity, empathy and self-awareness are the top traits companies value\n\nA slight divide could be found between employees surveyed and their\norganisations, when it came to the value each placed on key traits.\n\nFor instance, while 56% of employees valued empathy and integrity\nrespectively, 46% felt both were valued by their organisation as well.\nNonetheless, out of a list of skills shown, these two skills were most\nstrongly valued.\n\nApart from that, more employees found that their organisations placed great\nvalue on drive (41%), verbal communication (38%), and even emotional\ndetachment (14%), as compared to them (24%, 29%, and 3% respectively).\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/16120726/Priya-August-2019-HBR-AS-survey-chart-\nfigure-2-screengrab.jpg) ![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/16120738/Priya-August-2019-HBR-AS-survey-chart-\nfigure-2-screengrab-2.jpg) ![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/16120745/Priya-August-2019-HBR-AS-survey-chart-\nfigure-2-screengrab-3.jpg)\n\n\n\n### A shared sense of purpose increases productivity\n\nLastly, based on the report, when a perceptive organisation adopts a shared\nsense of purpose, it increases productivity at the workplace.\n\nIn fact, 34% of perceptive organisations surveyed 'strongly agreed' to this,\nas compared to just 13% of those uncommitted and a much lower 6% of those\ndetached.\n\n_Lead image and infographics /[Harvard Business Review - Analytic\nServices](https://hbr.org/)_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

According to the\nKPMG International global [Future of HR\nsurvey](https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2019/11/the-future-of-human-\nresources-2020.html), close to 3 in 5 (57 percent) Human Resources executives\nbelieve that if their function doesn't modernise its approach to understanding\nand planning for the future needs of the workforce, it will rapidly become\nirrelevant within the modern organisation.\n\nThe report argues that while there is little doubt that HR functions generally\nare experiencing at least some level of adversity as they navigate through\ntoday's complex, ever-changing world, some organisations seem to show a\ndiscrete pattern in regard to their areas of priority to tackle those\nchallenges. The report calls this grouping Pathfinding HR.\n\nAccording to Robert Bolton, Global Head of People & Change Center of\nExcellence and Partner, KPMG in the UK, \u201cPathfinding organizations are\nsimultaneously building capability across four discrete areas. In our view,\nthrough these capabilities HR can chart a course into the future with\nconfidence; shaping the workforce of the future in the face of digital\ndisruption.\u201d\n\nAs per the research, the four capabilities are:\n\n  1. **Shaping the workforce of the future:** Pathfinding HR organizations recognize that existing workforce structures are being disrupted by new technology and business models. They are seizing the opportunity to reshape the workforce and gain the full benefits of humans and machines working together.  \n\u2014 Three-quarters of Pathfinding organizations (76 percent) agree that HR needs\nactively challenge what the future workforce composition looks like (who to\nbuy, build, borrow, bot) in order to meet the future needs of their\norganization.  \n\u2014 3 in 4 (74 percent) are also prioritizing upskilling of the workforce to\nmanage the impact of Artificial Intelligence (and related) on the workforce.\n\n  2. **Shaping a purpose-led culture:** Pathfinding HR organizations understand that HR plays a vital role in shaping and maintaining a culture aligned with their business strategy.  \n\u2014 They are 6x more likely to \u201cstrongly agree\u201d that they have a strategy in\nplace to maintain the right culture for their organization (43 vs. 7 percent).  \n\u2014 They are 5x more `\u201dstrongly agree\u201d that they have dedicated roles in HR that\nfocus on purpose and culture (40 vs. 8 percent).\n\n  3. **Designing the employee experience:** Employees today want meaningful, rewarding work, on-demand customer service, and instant access to information. To meet those expectations, employee experience is on everyone's agenda, especially for Pathfinding HR organizations.  \n\u2014 95 percent of all respondents are prioritizing employee experience as a\nfocus area; and Pathfinding HR organizations were almost 3x more likely to\n\u201dstrongly agree\u201d that employee experience is a strategic priority for the\nentire organization (64 vs.19 percent).  \n\u2014 Three-quarters of Pathfinding HR (75 percent) also have a strategy in place\nto design employee experience that mirrors and supports customer experience\nand rank design thinking as a top needed skill within the HR function.\n\n  4. **Cracking the data code through workforce insight:** Pathfinding HR organizations believe in the power of data science to generate actionable insights that create value for the whole organization - and are investing accordingly.  \n\u2014 Almost half (45 percent) rank data modeler/scientist within their top three\nroles to invest in over the next two to three years specifically within HR;\nthey are almost twice as likely to invest in this role compared to their peers\n(45 vs. 24 percent).  \n\u2014 35 percent are also planning to experiment with new technologies like AI\nwithin two to three years (vs. 20 percent of their peers).\n\nBolton adds, \u201cWe see an interconnected and mutually reinforcing logic to\nbuilding capability in all four areas. Pathfinding HR organizations are\ntackling them all and this has an incredibly powerful and amplifying effect.\u201d\n\nIn 2020, the report claims to see a path forward for HR that requires some\nfundamentally new thinking about what HR does and how it is built to deliver.\nIt argues that the power of the next generation isn't in pursuing discrete and\ndisconnected capabilities, rather it is in creating a holistic and mutually\nreinforcing \u201dwhole system\u201d approach to building the workforce (and\norganization) of the future.\n\n### You may also like...\n\n  1.

media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\n## Hatching a progressive workplace and culture\n\n### _In this exclusive with_ Jerene Ang, Roselin Lee _, Vice President, HR,\nShiseido Asia Pacific, reveals HR\u2019s role in the journey of transforming the\n147-year-old Japanese organisation into a modern and diverse business._\n\nIn late 2015, Shiseido made a decision to establish its Asia Pacific\nheadquarters in Singapore to bring a team of leaders closer to the consumers\nand markets in the region. The headquarters was operational in early 2016 and\nRoselin Lee joined at the end of the year as the first executive hire in HR\nfor the region. She was tasked to build the regional leadership team, reinvent\nthe culture and perception of the organisation in line with its VISION 2020\nand build a future-ready talent pool.\n\nToday, she leads a team of 16 HR staff in the regional headquarters to manage\npeople programmes for the over 100-strong workforce in eight markets across\nAsia Pacific.\n\nIn this exclusive, Roselin Lee, Vice President, HR for Shiseido Asia Pacific\nand Shiseido Travel Retail, reveals HR\u2019s role in the journey of transforming\nthe 147-year-old Japanese organisation into a modern and diverse business.\n\n### Q Having joined the change journey in December 2016, what were the first\n100 days on the job like?\n\nI was hired to build up the team for the regional HQ in Singapore. So, my\nfirst 100 days was really about hiring leadership positions across various\nfunctions, including HR.\n\nBeing the first HR person in the APAC HQ, I asked my recruiting partners for\nhelp. The first comment they made was about Shiseido being perceived as a\nJapanese organisation which involved preconceived notions such as long working\nhours, relatively low pay, and leaving after the bosses do. That made me think\nabout what we can do to change this wrong perception and position ourselves as\nan employer.\n\nWhat I did was to meet all the candidates and tell them about Shiseido Group\u2019s\nVISION 2020, which talks about how we are thirsty to evolve and become very\ndifferent from the typical Japanese organisation people thought we were. We\nalso tell them about how we\u2019ve grown through brand acquisitions \u2013 something\nnot many Japanese firms in our industry do, especially in terms of acquiring\nWestern brands. We also shared with them what having a regional HQ outside of\nJapan means to Shiseido in terms of growing future-ready Asia leadership. We\nlooked to build diversity because we believe it is an enabler for us to start\nchanging the culture.\n\nMy role has always been about wanting to make a cultural shift. As HR, it is\nimportant for me to exemplify what it is like to be a part of Shiseido\u2019s\ntransformation journey into a modern diverse business. Today, in the Shiseido\nAPAC office, we have over 100 employees of 14 nationalities. We\u2019re more Asian\nnow, rather than Japanese, and we aren\u2019t working in a siloed environment\nanymore.\n\n> ##### As HR, it is important for me to exemplify what it is like to be a\n> part of Shiseido\u2019s transformation journey into a modern diverse business.\n\n### Q What was the rationale behind this transformation?\n\nFrom a broader perspective, we are transforming globally under the leadership\nof our Global CEO, Masahiko Uotani. From about three years ago, there has been\na change in terms of the way all employees, not just leaders, think \u2013 it\u2019s no\nlonger about Japan and the rest of the world. We now need to think about the\nspecific consumer needs and wants in the region.\n\nEqually, our staff have to consider what the emerging middle class in\nSoutheast Asia needs, versus those in the more mature markets of Taiwan and\nKorea, where they are very beauty-savvy. Hence, we need leaders who are agile\nand adaptable in the way they think. Additionally, we have always been proud\nof ourselves for bringing innovation to cosmetics, owing to which our\nconsumers are always waiting for new innovative products to be released.\nHence, we need leaders who have the competencies to be able to package such\nproducts, bring them to consumers faster, and make them more aspirational.\nUltimately, our leaders need to have an innovative mindset.\n\n### Q What are the key differences between Shiseido as it is now and the\ntraditional organisation it was in the past?\n\nAt Shiseido today, our mission is beauty innovations for a better world. What\nthis means for our people is they need to be agile, inclusive, digitally\nsavvy, innovative, and most importantly, have a global mindset.\n\nOne thing that sets us apart is learning and development. In a traditional\nJapanese firm, L&D is mainly on-the-job by rotating people through different\nroles. At Shiseido, to develop future-ready people, this year, we launched the\nAsia Learning Centre to equip them with the necessary skill sets, including\nsoft skills. We have put in place various programmes to drive the development\nof leadership capabilities, on top of learning through job rotations. We hope\nthis will enable individuals to be more well-rounded and true Asian leaders\nwith a growth mindset by interacting with people across the region.\n\n> ##### From about three years ago, there has been a change in terms of the\n> way all employees, not just leaders, think \u2013 it\u2019s no longer about Japan and\n> the rest of the world. We now need to think about the specific consumer\n> needs and wants in the region.\n\n### Q Tell me more about the Asia Learning Centre and the development\nprogrammes you have under it.\n\nThe Asia Learning Centre comes under L&D within the HR team. I have a team\nthat works with partners to build programmes that cater to various levels of\nemployees.\n\nMy team is working on a level-based learning road map which focuses on\ndifferent needs and skill sets, based on the organisational chart. We\ncurrently have four levels in the learning road map, which are available to\nall employees. Our staff can select the kind of skills they need, then go to\nthe learning directory to select the programme that best fits them.\n\nThe structure of the programme ties back closely to the attributes and\nbehaviours that we want our future-ready leaders to have \u2013 agile, inclusive,\ndigitally savvy, innovative, and most importantly, have a global mindset.\n\nWe have just rolled out module one of the essential leadership programme which\ntargets the managerial level. It is a five-day programme stretched over nine\nmonths and it uses a blended learning approach consisting of business\nsimulations, online learning, as well as formal classroom training. We also\nhave the inspirational leadership programme for the director level and the\ntransformational leadership programme for the senior executive level.\n\nNominations for these programmes are made on the basis of tenure and\nperformance. However, we are not just looking to train the top talent, the aim\nis to train all our employees as fast as possible. The nomination process is\nmore to keep a check on the class size (20-25 per session).\n\nThroughout the 30 years of my career, I have rarely seen an organisation\ninvest this strongly in talent development and the infrastructure to enable\nit, like Shiseido\u2019s Asia Learning Centre. Rather than it being about the\namount of money invested, it is about the organisation wanting to invest in\ndeveloping our people. Having this infrastructure, putting in the many\nleadership programmes \u2013 locally, regionally and globally \u2013 makes it evident to\nthe employees and candidates that we believe in them and strongly advocate in\ndeveloping people.\n\n### Q Apart from the Asia Learning Centre and the various L&D programmes, what\nis another way HR is involved in the transformation journey?\n\nI believe in a philosophy called \u2018people over process\u2019. I believe very\nstrongly that we should give employees what they want and need. Policy is\nstill important and it will be there as a reference, but it has to be flexible\nenough to engage the different demographics. It cannot be one-size-fits-all.\n\nTo create the One Shiseido Policy, what we did was to look at the existing\npolicy, what the market offers, and most importantly, hear what our employees\nwanted. This policy is flexible enough to cater to all our people.\n\nFor example, it comprises a work-from-home policy that allows employees to\nwork from outside the office. While this is something simple, it is also part\nof a culture change. In traditional Japanese organisations working from home\nis seldom considered, and this is something we would like to change.\n\n> ##### I believe in a philosophy called \u2018people over process\u2019. I believe very\n> strongly that we should give employees what they want and need.\n\n### Q When was this policy rolled out?\n\nIt was officially rolled out this year as it took us a bit of time to consider\nthe different business needs and requests by employees.\n\nApart from the work-from-home policy, we also implemented a flexi-benefits\nprogramme in July. This gives employees greater flexibility and ownership of\nhow they want their benefits to be designed. It is something I\u2019m very proud\nof.\n\nUnder this programme, we commit a certain amount of core benefits for the\nemployee. For example, if the employee doesn\u2019t need the maximum coverage for a\nterm life insurance that we provide as a core benefit, he or she can lower the\ncoverage and convert the balance into credits. These credits will be stored in\nan account and employees can use them to buy something they need more such as\na gym membership.\n\n### Q It\u2019s quite clear that diversity is one key theme of this transformation.\nTalk us through why and what this focus on diversity meant for you and the\nworkforce.\n\nIt all ties back to this being an APAC HQ and us wanting to develop our Asia\nleaders. It is about our desire to bring in different backgrounds and\nnationalities to learn from each other. If we want to be forward-thinking and\nevolve, it is important we come together from different backgrounds and learn\nfrom each other. Diversity is the start of the culture shift that helps enrich\neveryone\u2019s experiences and provides very different ways of how we think as an\norganisation.\n\nThis also goes back to moving away from preconceived notions of what working\nfor a Japanese company is like. When I was appointed, I was the first non-\nJapanese woman in the executive team. That is an honour, and at the same time,\nit illustrates the organisation embraces diversity. To share some statistics,\nwhen it comes to diversity, 50% of the MDs in our affiliates are local and/or\nfemale; and in APAC, 49% of our leaders, GM-level and above, are women.\n\n### Q Have you implemented any specific initiatives to enhance diversity?\n\nI think it starts from the senior leaders \u2013 they need to see that there is a\nneed for diversity and to have an inclusive culture.\n\nIt then comes down to our hiring practices. We have to make sure that we are\nhiring based on skills and that we don\u2019t only look at Japanese expats who have\nShiseido experience. In line with our mission \u2013 beauty innovations for a\nbetter world \u2013 it is important that the expertise we bring into this office\nand the organisation know the market and the consumers.\n\nOne example of local expertise is our recently promoted managing director for\nShiseido Thailand, who is Thai, a woman, and comes with more than 20 years of\nindustry experience in Thailand.\n\n> ##### To share some statistics, when it comes to diversity, 50% of the MDs\n> in our affiliates are local and/or female; and in APAC, 49% of our leaders,\n> GM-level and above, are women.\n\n### Q You mentioned inclusive \u2013 for many people, diversity and inclusion are\ndifferent. What is your take on it?\n\nTo be inclusive means that while we have a diverse workforce, the environment\nwe have created needs to enable everyone of them to operate. Again, it is\nabout \u2018people over process\u2019 \u2013 looking at what people want and what we can give\nthem to enable them to deliver the best in the workplace. My role as HR is to\nsupport the senior leaders and regional CEO to create this inclusive\nenvironment that also engages our people.\n\n### Q What would you say are the top three success factors of the change\njourney to date?\n\nFirst, it\u2019s \u2018people over process\u2019. We have to do something or introduce\nsomething our people really want, and not what we, as HR, want.\n\nSecond, with such a diverse and unique environment, we need to be\nentrepreneurial.\n\nThird, we need to be agile. We want to be future- ready so we must have that\nagility, be diverse and inclusive, as well as have both an Asian leadership\nmindset, and think global.\n\n### Q While the journey is still ongoing, what are the specific milestones and\nmetrics you have so far to communicate progress to your stakeholders?\n\nApart from the gender diversity statistics shared earlier, we have a target of\ntraining 2,000 people at our Asia Learning Centre in its first year of\nopening. We are currently tracking KPIs on training closely and, as of May,\neach employee has spent an average of 4.86 days in training since the launch.\nThese are just some of the metrics we are tracking right now and we want to be\nable to increase all these footholds, especially in learning and development,\nover the next two years.\n\n* * *\n\n**Vital stats:** As the Vice President, HR for Shiseido Asia Pacific and\nShiseido Travel Retail, Roselin Lee drives diversity and talent development;\noverseeing business partnering, learning and organisation development,\nemployee and workplace engagement, as well as rewards, benefits and mobility.\nShe comes with over 30 years of experience in HR management and began her\ncareer in HR with the goal of ensuring people are always placed in the roles\nthey could succeed in, and are given the best opportunities to develop their\ncareer.\n\n* * *\n\n_Art Direction: Mohd Ashraf;  \nPhotography: Lee Guang Shun (Studio Three Sixteen Pte Ltd) \u2013\n[www.studiothreesixteen.com](https://www.studiothreesixteen.com/);_  \n_Makeup & Hair: Michelle Chin\n([www.michmakeover.com](https://www.michmakeover.com/)) Using YSL beauty\nSingapore_\n\n### **This interview has been published in _Human Resources_ magazine. **Read\nthe August edition of _Human Resources_ , Singapore:\n\n[![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/19142412/hrsg_aug19.jpg)](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/)\n\n\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

They know that hiring can\u2019t be done by [**a\nbot**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2019/01/08/ten-hr-trends-in-\nthe-age-of-artificial-intelligence/#4500a97e3219), that there is a human\naspect to finding the [**right\nfit**](https://knowledge.insead.edu/blog/insead-blog/six-reasons-to-hire-\nmilitary-veterans-4430) for a particular team, and that there is great value\nin working across divides, be they cultural or functional.\n\nIn a recent **_[Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/product/cross-silo-\nleadership/R1903J-HCB-ENG?referral=03069)_** article, **[Tiziana\nCasciaro](http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/Faculty/FacultyBios/Casciaro)**\n(Rotman School of Management), **[Amy C.\nEdmondson](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6451)**\n(Harvard Business School) and [**Sujin Jang**](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-\nresearch/faculty/sujin-jang), Assistant Professor of Organisational Behaviour\nat INSEAD, argue that employees who communicate and collaborate across silos\nto provide integrated solutions for their clients create great value for their\norganisations. Drawing on their work with hundreds of executives across many\norganisations, the authors present a set of practices that facilitates cross-\nsilo leadership, which can be learned and developed over time.\n\nHow can HR professionals leverage this research to ensure that both job\ncandidates and in-house talent are in a position to work well across\ndepartments, regions or functions? In many firms, such skills may be\nmistakenly considered non-essential or \u201cnice to have\u201d. But the bottom line is\nthat organisations that fail to cross silos are at risk of not providing the\nservices their customers need.\n\nFor cross-silo leadership, HR managers can focus on hiring and developing\ntalent with the following skills:\n\n  * Cultivating cultural brokerage\n  * Asking questions that facilitate perspective taking\n  * Expanding points of view through network scanning\n\n**Hire and develop cultural brokers**\n\nAs Jang has previously written, [**cultural\nbrokers**](https://knowledge.insead.edu/leadership-organisations/cultural-\nbrokers-boost-the-creative-performance-of-diverse-teams-9016) facilitate\ninteractions between individuals who have different sets of assumptions,\nvalues and norms. Although her [**original\nresearch**](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/orsc.2017.1162) on\nthis topic is based mostly on people working in _multinational_ teams, she\nposits that functional or organisational cultures can also be brokered.\n\nJang identified two distinct roles of cultural brokerage: Those who help\ncolleagues work around cultural differences (\u201cbridges\u201d) and those who connect\ncolleagues with one another to build lasting relationships (\u201cadhesives\u201d).\n\n  * A \u201cbridge\u201d allows others to collaborate across silos with little disruption to their daily routine. They do this by taking care of the cross-silo work on behalf of others, in such a way that other employees can continue working as they would within their own silo.\n  * An \u201cadhesive\u201d connects colleagues and helps them work directly with one another, rather than acting as a bridge between them. They sow the ground for further fertile relationships to flourish, independent of the cultural broker.\n\nCultural brokers create great value for a firm. HR professionals can identify\ncultural brokers by looking at candidates\u2019 background and experience. These\nare the candidates who tend to have experience in multiple domains (who have\nlived and worked in multiple cultures or in multiple functions) and have\nexperience helping people work across domains. Such candidates may have been\ninvolved in post-merger integration or have experience simultaneously working\nwith others from multiple functions, for example.\n\nTo create an environment for current employees to engage in cultural\nbrokerage, HR managers can consider rotation programmes or matrix structures,\nwhich provide ample opportunities to develop the skills required to be a\ncultural broker.\n\n**Encourage inquiry and perspective taking**\n\nAsking good questions and taking others\u2019 perspective on-board are another set\nof skills that HR managers can look for in candidates and encourage among in-\nhouse talent.\n\nOne way employees can see the world through the eyes of others is by asking\ngood questions. Many organisations explicitly hire for demonstrated connecting\nskills. Southwest Airlines, for example, evaluates empathy when sourcing\ncustomer-facing roles. As a result, the company is famous for its award-\nwinning customer service.\n\nIn an interview, an HR manager can listen carefully to the kinds of questions\nasked by candidates. Are they asking open-ended questions that allow them to\ngain a better understanding of the organisation and their role? Are they\nasking questions to check their own understanding along the way? Candidates\nwho ask the right kinds of questions know how to engage in effective inquiry\nto gain perspective.\n\nBeyond hiring for perspective-taking ability, it is also important that a firm\nprovides opportunities to further develop individuals\u2019 perspective-taking\ncapacity after they join the organisation. Some large firms like\n[**GE**](https://www.businessinsider.com/ge-green-beret-executive-development-\nprogram?IR=T) have programmes requiring high-potentials to rotate in different\nfunctions such as finance and marketing over the course of several years.\nFirms with this kind of training recognise the importance of executives who\ncan span divides. Naturally, the high-potentials are not experts in every\nfield, but they do have a sense of what it's like to work in the different\nparts of the business. A more [**technological\nsolution**](https://knowledge.insead.edu/blog/insead-blog/digitally-enabling-\ncustomer-loyalty-6971) to encourage perspective taking is found in Sberbank,\nwhere employees wear a VR suit literally called \u201cEmpathy\u201d to develop\ncompassion for their elderly clients and their possible physical limitations.\n\nHaving a workforce with developed perspective-taking skills leads to several\nimportant benefits. Edmondson has found that [**cross-industry\ncollaborations**](https://hbr.org/2016/06/wicked-problem-solvers) can succeed\nwhen diverse workers take on the perspectives of other workers from dissimilar\nbackgrounds. And\n[**Casciaro**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjNv77Sxb7iAhVE8uAKHUinBuoQFjAAegQIBBAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2F2018%2F09%2Fcuriosity&usg=AOvVaw01zly8cvK8XGLhimwqhyPR)\u2019s\nwork shows that curious employees who ask the right types of questions build\nbroad networks that [**span\nboundaries**](https://knowledge.insead.edu/strategy/spanning-the-boundaries-\nthat-limit-organisational-innovativeness-8371) across disparate parts of the\ncompany.\n\n**Help employees leverage their holistic view of the network**\n\nFinally, one of the challenges of working across divides has to do with the\nperception of who is connected to whom beyond the formal org chart. This\nability to perceive the web of connection in an organisation is important,\nbecause the more employees can broaden their vision of where the interesting\nopportunities are or where the important intersections might be, the easier it\nis to work across silos. Casciaro found that people don\u2019t understand exactly\nwho is connected to whom in a network, or what she calls \u201celemental\u201d\nperception. For example, if I know Ben and Saeedah, I tend to assume they know\neach other, even if this isn\u2019t actually the case. Elemental perception isn\u2019t\nour strong point. Instead, people are more effective at \u201cholistic\u201d perception\nof networks, such as determining who is central in a network. That is, it\u2019s\neasier to see which colleague is connected to everyone and which one works on\nthe periphery. With this holistic perception, we understand who our go-to\nperson for information is. Employees can develop their network perception by\nasking questions and working out who is central in an organisation.\n\nHR managers can help employees distinguish between elemental and holistic\nperceptions and encourage them to trust their holistic perceptions. When\nemployees start seeing the forest of connections rather than the trees of\nindividuals, they can connect across silos more effectively. In addition,\nleveraging their holistic network vision will also help them determine which\nrelationships are in need of cultural brokerage and which ones would benefit\nfrom thoughtful inquiry and perspective taking.\n\n**Cross-silo skills and alignment of incentives**\n\nThe research by Casciaro, Edmondson and Jang suggests that it is possible to\nlook for and develop all these skills in job candidates. Although it requires\nsome investment, the potential payoffs are great: Employees who can engage in\ncultural brokerage, take others\u2019 perspective and see the informal network in\nthe organisation are much better equipped to provide the kind of cross-silo\nsolutions that customers need.\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to fostering these skills is that these behaviours\nare often considered non-urgent and are therefore not necessarily rewarded in\na way that equals the value they bring to a firm. That is, the connection\nbetween who does the work (employees) and who benefits (the company) is often\nmissing. To support these activities, organisations \u2013 and HR professionals in\nparticular \u2013 can put structures and incentives in place to encourage these\nskills.\n\n[**_Sujin Jang_**](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/sujin-jang)\n_is an Assistant Professor of Organisational Behaviour at INSEAD._\n\n_Tiziana Casciaro is a Professor of Organizational Behavior at Rotman School\nof Management; Amy C.

revealed\n\nPublished Wed, Jan 23 20198:00 AM ESTUpdated Wed, Jan 23 20196:52 PM EST\n\n[Eugene Kim](https://www.cnbc.com/eugene-\nkim/)[@eugenekim222](https://twitter.com/@eugenekim222)\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Unlike other tech giants that saw a series of executive departures or varying degrees of reshuffles last year, Amazon\u2019s executives at the highest level largely remained unchanged.\n  * That trust and comfort between Jeff Bezos and the rest of the leadership team will once again come under the spotlight this year, since stability at the top is considered one of the key reasons for Amazon\u2019s success.\n  * Still, almost all of the top executives at its consumer-facing businesses, like retail, cloud, and hardware, are exclusively white men \u2014 only four of the 48 executives in those roles are women.\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos, founder of space venture Blue Origin and owner of The\nWashington Post, participates in an event hosted by the Air Force Association\nSeptember 19, 2018 in National Harbor, Maryland.\n\nAlex Wong | Getty Images\n\nDuring [Amazon](/quotes/?symbol=AMZN)'s most recent all-hands staff meeting\nheld in November, CEO Jeff Bezos explained why he's no longer taking live\nquestions from employees at the event. Some questions had become too specific\nto small teams, he said, and the new format would allow employees from all\nover the world to more easily submit questions.\n\nThe change, however, wasn't made to avoid tough questions, Bezos said \u2014\nbecause in the worst case, he added with a laugh, he could just defer those to\nhis executive team members.\n\n\"There's no question that could stymie me because I'm so comfortable saying 'I\ndon't know,'\" Bezos said, according to a recording of the meeting heard by\nCNBC. \"If [the question] is super hard, I just delegate it.\"\n\nBezos' comment about delegation was a joke, but it also reflects an important\naspect of his leadership culture: the camaraderie he's built over the years\nwith his most senior executives at Amazon.\n\nVIDEO6:2106:21\n\nAmazon's push for delivery service puts more pressure on its suppliers, says\nanalyst\n\n[Closing Bell](https://www.cnbc.com/closing-bell/)\n\nThat trust and comfort between Bezos and the rest of the leadership is\nimportant, since stability at the top is [one of the key\nreasons](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/why-amazon-is-the-most-valuable-\npublic-company.html) for Amazon's success. Amazon is known for seeing very\nlittle turnover among its most important power players, with many of them\nhaving been at the company for years, if not decades \u2014 a point [Bezos\npreviously highlighted](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/18/amazon-exec-diego-\npiacentini-has-left-after-two-year-leave.html) as one of the company's\nstrengths.\n\nAccording to an internal organization chart seen by CNBC, Amazon's executives\nat the highest level are largely unchanged from [the leadership chart CNBC put\ntogether in November 2017](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/28/who-are-amazons-\ntop-executives.html). Bezos, for example, lost only one of his direct reports,\nwho was already on a two-year hiatus.\n\nThere have been some notable changes among lower-level executives, however.\nUnusually, Amazon saw several departures among its VP-level executives last\nyear, while Bezos lost two of his S-Team members, a tight-knit group of over a\ndozen senior executives famous for seeing very few departures historically.\n\nOne thing has not changed: Almost all of the executives at the top of Amazon's\nconsumer-facing businesses, like retail, cloud and hardware, are white men.\nOnly four of the 48 executives in those roles are women. That number goes up\nslightly if you include PR and HR roles, but Beth Galetti, senior vice\npresident of human resources, is still Bezos' only female direct report.\n\nThere are still no African-Americans and only a handful of people of Asian\ndescent in this group. However, many of the \"shadow\" advisor roles, a highly\ncoveted temporary position that follows top executives to every meeting for\ntraining purposes, are women.\n\nAmazon's representative wasn't immediately available for comment.\n\nHere are the the six most important decision-makers at Amazon and their direct\nreports, excluding non-consumer-facing roles, like HR, finance and legal:\n\n## Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO:\n\nBezos saw almost no change in his direct reports last year, except for one\nvery notable loss.\n\nAs [CNBC reported in December](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/18/amazon-exec-\ndiego-piacentini-has-left-after-two-year-leave.html), Diego Piacentini, a\nlongtime Amazon executive and one of its largest shareholders, decided to\nleave the company following a two-year hiatus working with the Italian\ngovernment.\n\nPiacentini's departure was particularly interesting because it was the second\nS-Team loss in 2018, after Sebastian Gunningham, SVP of marketplace, left in\nMarch. S-Team members don't necessarily report directly to Bezos as they move\naround the company leading different projects.\n\nBezos also got [a new shadow advisor](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/19/bezos-\nnew-shadow-adviser-at-amazon-is-a-woman-of-chinese-descent.html) in Wei Gao,\nthe second woman ever to fill the role.\n\n  * Jeff Wilke, CEO of worldwide consumer\n  * Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services\n  * Jeff Blackburn, SVP, business and corporate development\n  * Dave Limp, SVP, Amazon devices, digital management\n  * Brian Olsavsky, SVP & CFO\n  * David Zapolsky, SVP & general counsel\n  * Beth Galetti, SVP, human resources\n  * Jay Carney, SVP, corporate affairs\n  * Wei Gao, VP Technical Advisor to CEO\n\nJeff Wilke, chief executive officer of worldwide consumer of Amazon.com.\n\nMike Kane | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\n## Jeff Wilke, worldwide consumer CEO:\n\nWilke's team saw some turnover last year, as at least five of his direct\nreports left or changed roles. Greg Greeley, VP of Prime, and Chee Chew, VP of\nconsumer engagement, each left for Airbnb and Twilio, respectively. Gunningham\nwent to WeWork.\n\nPeter Faricy, who took over most of Gunningham's responsibilities last year,\nalso left the company after [a reshuffling in the marketplace\nteam](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/21/amazons-marketplace-vp-peter-faricy-\nlose-most-responsibilities.html). Neil Lindsay, VP of marketing, [took over\nGreeley's former role](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/08/amazon-prime-boss-greg-\ngreeley-turns-attention-to-whole-foods.html), and now manages worldwide\nmarketing and the Prime program. Sukumar Rathnam, VP of Selection and Catalog\nSystems, was briefly one of Wilke's direct reports last year, but is now\nreporting to someone else within Wilke's organization.\n\nRuss Grandinetti, who runs international business, has the largest number of\ndirect reports under him, as Amazon is aggressively expanding its presence\noverseas. Sarah Jane Gunter, who was Wilke's shadow assistant, has been\nreplaced by Yunyan Wang, a woman of Chinese descent.\n\n  * Dave Clark, SVP, Worldwide Operations\n  * Dave Treadwell, VP, eCommerce Foundation\n  * Doug Herrington, SVP, North America Consumer\n  * Gur Kimchi, VP, Prime Air\n  * Neil Lindsay, VP, WW Prime and Marketing, WW Advertising and Marketing\n  * Pat Bajari, VP and Chief Economist\n  * Russell Grandinetti, SVP International Consumer\n  * Steven Kessel, SVP Physical Stores\n  * Tony Hsieh, CEO, Zappos\n  * Yunyan Wang, Technical Advisor, Consumer\n\nAndy Jassy, chief executive officer of web services at Amazon.com Inc., speaks\nduring the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Summit in San Francisco, California,\nU.S., on Wednesday, April 19, 2017.\n\nDavid Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\n## Andy Jassy, AWS CEO:\n\nJassy's team also saw a few changes in his direct reports last year. Scott\nWiltamuth, former VP of development & management tools, joined the machine\nlearning services team. Brent Jaye, VP of AWS Support, still lists that title\non his LinkedIn profile, but no longer reports to Jassy, according to the\ncompany's internal organization chart.\n\nKrystal Walsh-Allen, Jassy's shadow advisor, has been replaced by Doug Yeum,\nformerly head of Amazon Korea.\n\nAlso, Adam Bosworth, who joined from Salesforce in 2017, is now in charge of\nAWS New Products, likely related to AWS Everyone, a secretive project for \"low\ncode/no code\" software, as [Geekwire previously\nreported](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/aws-everyone-new-clues-emerge-amazons-\nsecretive-low-code-no-code-project/).\n\nThere is also a couple of leaders who aren't part of AWS but nonetheless\nreport to Jassy. Babak Parviz, who runs [the secretive Grand Challenge\nteam](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/05/amazon-grand-challenge-moonshot-lab-\ngoogle-glass-creator-babak-parviz.html), is organizationally under AWS' CEO,\nas is Twitch founder Emmett Shear. But it's unclear how involved Jassy is in\nthe day to day operations of those units.\n\n  * Adam Bosworth, VP, AWS New Products\n  * Alex Yung, VP, AWS Sales China\n  * Ariel Kelman, VP, AWS WW Marketing\n  * Babak Parviz, VP, Grand Challenge\n  * Bing Gordon, Strategic Advisor\n  * Charlie Bell, SVP Utility Computing Services\n  * Doug Yeum, Director, Technical Advisor, AWS\n  * Emmett Shear, CEO, Office of CEO\n  * James Hamilton, VP/Distinguished Engineer, AWS\n  * Michael Frazzini, VP, Game Services and Studios\n  * Mike Clayville, VP, WW Sales & BD, AWS Commercial Sales\n  * Peter DeSantis, VP, AWS Global Infrastructure\n  * Stephen Schmidt, Chief Info Sec Officer, AWS Security\n  * Teresa Carlson, VP, Worldwide Pubic Sector Sales\n  * Werner Vogels, VP and CTO\n\n(L-R) Actor Casey Affleck with his award for best actor in 'Manchester By The\nSea' and Amazon SVP Jeff Blackburn attend the Amazon Studios Oscar Celebration\nat Delilah on February 26, 2017 in West Hollywood, California.\n\nTodd Williamson | Getty Images\n\n## Jeff Blackburn, SVP of Business Development and Other Corporate\nDevelopment:\n\nBlackburn, who manages the \"other\" parts of Amazon, like its advertising and\nvideo services, saw two changes in his direct reports. Albert Cheng, who\ntemporarily took over Roy Price's job as head of Amazon Studios in 2017, has\nbeen replaced by Jennifer Salke. Jason Ropell, who worked closely with Price,\nhas also left.\n\nAmazon's advertising boss Paul Kotas, IMDB's Col Needham, and Amazon Music's\nSteve Boom all report up to Blackburn as well.\n\n  * Col Needham, Founder & CEO, IMDb\n  * Dan Jedda, VP, DAC Finance\n  * David Shearer, VP, WW Business Development\n  * Greg Hart, VP, WW Amazon Video, DV Core Platform\n  * Jennifer Salke, Head of Amazon Studios, DV Prime Video TV\n  * Paul Kotas, SVP, Amazon Advertising\n  * Peter Krawiec, VP, WW Corporate Development\n  * Steve Boom, VP Digital Music\n\nDave Limp, Senior Vice President of Amazon Devices, introduces the 'Echo\nAuto,' which allows users to use Alexa in their car, during an event at the\nAmazon Spheres, on September 20, 2018 in Seattle Washington. Amazon launched\nmore than 70 Alexa-enable products during the event.\n\nStephen Brashear | Getty Images\n\n## Dave Limp, SVP of Amazon Devices, Digital Management\n\nLimp, in charge of all hardware and Alexa voice assistant teams, didn't see\nmuch change either. Only Douglas Booms is no longer reporting to Limp, but he\nstill remains within his organization.\n\nA secretive robotics project called \"Vesta,\" which is reported to be a new\nhome robot, [according to\nBloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-23/amazon-is-said-\nto-be-working-on-another-big-bet-home-robots), is run by Gregg Zehr, a\nlongtime Lab126 executive.\n\nRing CEO Jamie Siminoff, who joined Amazon after it bought Ring for nearly $1\nbillion last year, and S-Team member Tom Taylor also report to Limp.\n\n  * Gregg Zehr, President, Lab126\n  * Jae Park, Head of UX Design, Devices and Services\n  * Jamie Siminoff, CEO, Ring\n  * Jorrit Van der Meulen, VP, Amazon Devices International (EU)\n  * Linda Ranz, Technical Assistant, Amazon Devices\n  * Lindo St. Angel, VP, Hardware\n  * Marc Whitten, VP, Fire TV\n  * Melissa Eamer, VP, Devices\n  * Robert Stites, VP, Operations and Supply Chain\n  * Robert Williams, VP, Software\n  * Tom Taylor, SVP, Alexa Management\n\nJay Carney\n\nGetty Images\n\n## Jay Carney, SVP of Global Corporate Affairs:\n\nCarney, the former press secretary to President Barack Obama, is in charge of\nall of Amazon's corporate communications and public relations, as well as\npublic policy globally. His team is likely to see increased pressure this\nyear, as Amazon finds its way to navigate through the policy issues\nsurrounding the company.\n\nThe biggest change is the hiring of Susan Pointer from Google, who is now\nhandling all public policy issues for both the Europe, Middle East, and Africa\n(EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) regions. As a result, at least five of Carney's\nprevious direct reports, are no longer reporting straight to him.\n\nSome of Carney's team members have background in the government, which makes\nsense given the potential for more regulatory scrutiny in the company. Michael\nPunke served as the U.S. ambassador to the World Trade Organization for seven\nyears, before joining Amazon in early 2017. Brian Huseman was at the Federal\nTrade Commission for over seven years as well.\n\nTwo notable additions to Carney's direct reports are Tamara Golihew and Vicky\nEguia. Golihew is in charge of Amazon Studios PR, while Eguia does PR for\nAmazon's Original Movies team. Those two now report to Carney after Craig\nBerman, former Amazon Studios PR chief left last year.\n\n  * Brian Huseman, VP, Public Policy, Americas\n  * Christina Lee, VP, Consumer PR\n  * Drew

Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\n### _Look around you and ask someone what work-life balance means to them, and\nthey\u2019ll think about achieving balance between their work and life\nresponsibilities._ _In line with that, in the[August edition of Human\nResources\n(Singapore)](https://issuu.com/humanresourcesonline/docs/hrsg_aug19), we\nexplored a newer concept - work-life harmony, with a [special\nfeature](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/features/goodbye-work-life-\nbalance-hello-work-life-harmony/) on what integrating work and life really\nmeans. _\n\n### _In this article, we hear from the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and\nProgressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) on exactly how the work-life\nlandscape has evolved in Singapore over the past five years._\n\n### Evolution of the work-life landscape in Singapore\n\nThe Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP),\nin collaboration with _The Straits Times_ , conducted a survey on work-life\nharmony and flexible work arrangements (FWAs). The [survey\nresults](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/employers-in-singapore-more-\nconscious-of-enabling-work-life-harmony/), released in June, captured the\nresponses of 511 employers and 1,000 employees.\n\nThis survey, which was first conducted in 2014, aimed to understand the\ncurrent state of work-life harmony in Singapore, the challenges of\nimplementation, and to gain insights of views and concerns of both employers\nand employees.\n\n### What has changed in the past five years?\n\nAn ageing and shrinking population is having an impact on the workforce.\n\n> ##### Juggling work responsibilities while managing caregiving duties of\n> both children and ageing parents can take a toll on the \u2018sandwiched\u2019\n> generation in the workforce.\n\nMany of them rely on external resources for support such as childcare centres\nfor their children, or senior centres for their parents, due to fewer or no\nsiblings to share the responsibilities with.\n\nMeanwhile, extended families have also shrunk, further straining alternative\ncaregiving resources.\n\nThe multiple responsibilities, as an employee, parent and child, will also\nintensify time stress and possibly increase mental, emotional and financial\npressures as well. All these can lead to burnout if not managed properly.\n\nThese factors point towards a much greater need for work-life harmony among\nemployees today. As all employees juggle multiple roles, their needs cut\nacross different age groups, genders and life and career stages.\n\n_Note: Work-life harmony is defined as a state in which an individual is able\nto achieve both personal and professional goals in a combination that is\nuniquely satisfactory. This differs across individuals as different people\nhave different needs, responsibilities, values and priorities._\n\n### What are the key findings from the survey?\n\n**Shift 1: Work-life programmes are being implemented more strategically and\nformally, resulting in greater alignment between employers and employees.**\n\nEmployers are increasingly recognising the value of work-life programmes in\nmanaging manpower needs \u2013 82% agreed they enhanced their company image and 80%\nagreed they were important in attracting and recruiting top talent, up from\n68% and 74% respectively in 2014.\n\nThe survey also showed a shift towards formal channels in communicating\navailable work-life programmes to the organisation, suggesting that policies\nand practices are becoming more structured and formalised.\n\n![chart1](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/09102636/chart1-700x519.png)\n\nThese shifts have resulted in employers and employees being more aligned in\ntheir views towards work-life harmony.\n\nThe survey revealed that 83% of employers, up from 80% in 2014, believed that\nemployees should have the flexibility to manage their time and schedule as\nlong as they were able to meet work targets, converging with 82% of employees,\nup from 76% in 2014, who believed their supervisor provided them the\nflexibility to do so.\n\n**Shift 2: Middle managers recognise their role as facilitators**\n\nThe results showed that a growing proportion of supervisors are beginning to\nunderstand and accept the role they play in facilitating the organisation\u2019s\nwork-life strategy. In fact, 72%, up from 64% in 2014, saw it as their\nresponsibility to ensure their employees achieve work-life harmony.\n\nMeanwhile, 81% of supervisors were aligned with the organisation\u2019s\ncommunicated policy on work-life harmony, up from 68% in 2014. Their increased\nsupport is felt by employees, where \u2018support from supervisors\u2019 was highlighted\nas the top key enabler that helped employees achieve good work-life harmony.\n\nWith the implementation of FWAs becoming more prevalent among workplaces\ntoday, supervisors are managing teams who may be on a combination of flexible\nwork arrangements within their team, resulting in greater operational\nconcerns. Supervisors were concerned about equity in workload in their team\nwhen a team member requests to be on a flexible work arrangement.\n\nNotably, the percentage of supervisors who were concerned that employees were\nnot getting his or her job done fell from 56% to 28%, which indicates that\nsupervisors might be putting in place more effective ways to measure\nperformance.\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/09102756/chart-3.png) ![chart-2](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/09102747/chart-2.png)\n\n**Shift 3: A more inclusive approach in work-life strategies**\n\nOrganisations are adopting a more inclusive approach towards employees. While\nworking mothers with young children continue to be key beneficiaries, working\nfathers with young children are now utilising FWAs as much as working mothers\nwith young children, and are expressing their need for work-life harmony. They\nare not afraid to highlight the value and impact a pro work-life organisation\nhas on them.\n\nA significantly larger proportion of them also leverage on FWAs, such as\nstaggered start and end times (34% in 2018, up from 15% in 2014) and\ntelecommuting (26% in 2018, up from 15% in 2014).\n\nWorking mothers with young children continue to receive strong support \u2013 82%,\nup from 69% in 2014, agreed their supervisor provides them with the\nflexibility to manage their own time and schedule as long as work targets and\ndeadlines are met, and 78%, up from 66% in 2014, feel their supervisor is open\ntowards FWAs when required.\n\nAs dual income families in Singapore become more common, both genders\nincreasingly have to deal with the interests of both work and family. An\nequilibrium in parenting, where both father and mother are actively involved\nin parenting, has strengthened the need for work-life harmony, regardless of\ngender.\n\n**Shift 4: FWAs as a sustainable option**\n\nFWAs have been recognised as a means to manage employee work-life needs more\nsustainably, as indicated by an increase in the provision of FWAs and a drop\nin leave benefits in TAFEP\u2019s survey results.\n\nThere seems to be a growing understanding that some work-life needs,\nespecially those that are longer term or life-stage related, can be more\nsustainably managed through the use of FWAs. For example, providing an\nemployee with the flexibility at work to deal with regular or chronic medical\nneeds of a family member is likely to be more effective in the long-run, as\nopposed to a day\u2019s leave or a few hours off intermittently.\n\nThese findings are validated by the employee respondents themselves, who\nranked FWAs as more beneficial than leave benefits. Likewise, the results\nshowed an increase in the utilisation of FWAs and a decrease in the\nutilisation of leave benefits.\n\nAnd it seems organisations are moving in the right direction, as the results\nshowed that employees with various caregiving needs expressed greater\nsatisfaction with work-life programmes provided by their organisation.\n\n![chart-6](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/09103007/chart-6.png)\n\n### What does this mean for Singapore\u2019s workforce?\n\nThe changing employment and demographic landscape calls for new perspectives\nand a change of mindset from the way we approached work-life harmony before.\n\nAs the need for work-life harmony becomes increasingly urgent, the importance\nof work-life programmes cannot be understated.\n\nWhen used strategically, it becomes a powerful and effective attraction,\nretention and engagement tool that enables you to facilitate employees\u2019 needs\nthrough different life stages, regardless of age, gender or stage of their\ncareer. Only then can we remain agile and thrive in the ever-changing\nemployment landscape.\n\n**ALSO READ:**\n\n  * [How Go-Ahead Singapore moves forward with flexibility for employees](http://humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-go-ahead-singapore-moves-forward-with-flexibility-for-employees/)\n  * [How foodpanda is overcoming the matter of people working \u201csystematically long hours\u201d](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/case-study-how-foodpanda-is-overcoming-the-matter-of-people-working-systematically-long-hours/)\n\n* * *\n\n_Visit[TAFEP\u2019s website](http://tafep.sg/) to find out more on the Tripartite\nStandards._\n\n* * *\n\nThis feature has been published in _Human Resources_ magazine.

Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\n[\u95b1\u8b80\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u672c](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/?p=124136&preview=true)\n\nIt\u2019s one of the more onerous jobs of an HR professional. Nobody likes giving a\nformal warning letter. But in every people manager\u2019s career \u2013 when handling an\nunderperforming employee \u2013 there will most likely be times that it\u2019s necessary\nto issue one.\n\nOne unscrupulous employer known to _Human Resources_ has, on at least one\noccasion, used a formal warning letter to shame an employee into quitting.\nThat is __not__ what a formal warning is for.\n\n**Why issue a formal warning?**\n\nBy definition, a formal warning is a letter that is part of a member of\nstaff\u2019s file for future reference. It clearly outlines concerns surrounding\nperformance or misconduct and any necessary action plan of what the employee\nneeds to do to improve.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that it is, but one step with which to deal with\nemployee performance issues, and according to Alex Hattingh, chief people\nofficer at cloud-based HR management system, Employment Hero, it shouldn\u2019t be\nthe first.\n\n\u201cThe number one rule regarding formal written warnings is that they should\nnever be a surprise to an employee,\u201d she says.\n\nPerformance concerns should be raised during private one-on-one meetings and\nwritten warnings should only take place after all other avenues have been\nexhausted.\n\n**Escalating an informal warning to the next level**\n\nHattingh advises that prior to issuing a formal written warning, try to\nresolve the issue with an informal verbal warning to make the employee aware\nthey aren\u2019t meeting the expectations of their role. While this isn\u2019t written,\nyou do need to clearly articulate the particular areas of underperformance.\n\nIf verbal warnings don\u2019t result in noticeable improvements in performance \u2013 or\nat the very least, endeavour \u2013 you may want to proceed to the formal written\nwarning.\n\n**Components of a formal written warning**\n\nReference your informal verbal conversation(s) and include key dates.\n\n  * Specify details of the areas where your employee is underperforming and always provide examples.\n  * Reference the number of the warning letter (first, second, third).\n  * Create an action plan and communicate dates that you plan to check-in with your employee.\n  * Make it clear that another written warning could be issued or employment could be terminated if expectations are not met.\n  * Reassure your employee that the warning is confidential.\n\nHattingh advises: \u201cYou should always discuss the specifics of the written\nwarning letter with your employee prior to physically delivering it as it\nallows them to ask questions and clarify any issues or concerns before they\nreceive and review it in writing.\u201d\n\n**Formal written warnings and the law**\n\nTo the strict letter of the law, there is no legal requirement to provide a\nformal written warning before termination, although an employee can claim they\nhave been unfairly dismissed if they haven\u2019t been given fair warning and a\nreasonable amount of time to improve their performance.\n\nThe appropriate number of warnings is not set in stone. It is based on what is\nfair and reasonable, taking into account nature and seriousness of the\nunderperformance and what level of progress the employee is making to come up\nto the organisation\u2019s standards.\n\n_Parts of this article were first published\non[seek.com](https://insightsresources.seek.com.au/everything-you-need-to-\nknow-about-giving-a-formal-warning?tracking=EMC-SAU-eDM-\nHVisNewsletterQ1-20819&utm_campaign=HeDMVisQ114383&utm_source=SEEK&utm_medium=eDM&utm_content=NewsletterBodyArt2SMEN)\n_  \n__\n\n\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

But there are several areas where\nthe pace of change has yet to catch up with the new realities of business.\nChief HR officers and their teams must take the lead with agility and sustain\nexponential value for the future of human resources.\n\nEnterprises are fundamentally shifting with new business models, technologies,\nand changing expectations of\u2014and by\u2014the workforce. Often, HR teams are left\nstraddling the needs of the legacy organization while planning for the needs\nof the future.\n\nThis creates unprecedented opportunity for HR to play a new and vital role in\nshaping the way enterprises compete, access talent, and show up in the\ncommunities where they operate. Enterprises can compete\u2014and succeed\u2014by\nchanging entire business models in the field, product and services\ndevelopment, sales, production, leadership teams, and back office. And, of\ncourse, in the HR suite.\n\nDisruption is creating three key futures that HR must address:\n\n\u2022 The future of enterprise  \n\u2022 The future of the workforce  \n\u2022 The future of how work gets done\n\n**Enterprise:** Disruption in enterprise is being accelerated by a tsunami of\ndata that has increased by more than nine times over the past two years, the\nshortening life span of S&P 500 companies to an average of a mere 15 years,\nand the expectations of businesses that are trusted more than governments by\npeople around the world. HR has the opportunity to help the enterprise become\na social one, drive innovation and agility through workforce development, and\nhelp extend the enterprise with a partnership ecosystem.\n\n**Workforce:** Disruption is accelerating in the workforce, where the length\nof careers is increasing to as much as 50 years at the same time that the\nhalf-life of skills has diminished to between 2 and 5.5 years. Major shifts\nare coming with the rapid rise of the open talent economy, in which it is\nestimated that more than 40 percent of the workforce will be contingent by\n2020. HR leaders have an opportunity to build an inclusive workforce with many\ndifferent skills in talents. They can create new workforce experiences to\ninvigorate teamwork and productivity. HR must also forecast future\ncapabilities and enable continuous learning.\n\n**How Work Gets Done:** Organizations have yet to understand just how\ndigitization will fundamentally change how humans and their emerging machine\ncoworkers will work together. This will create massive new value for customers\nand the enterprise, but will also create new roles for workers that we have\nyet to imagine. HR leaders must re-imagine the work across the enterprise and\nHR with digitization and automation. HR must leap to a fit-for-purpose HR\noperating model to suit the enterprise and advance the workplace to enable\nworkforce collaboration.\n\nMany HR leaders have renamed their functions, using terms such as \u201cemployee\nexperience,\u201d \u201cpeople,\u201d and others to signal a shift in brand. Words matter,\nand this isn\u2019t the first time that the rebranding of \u201cHR\u201d has happened at\nmajor inflection points in the history of the function.\n\nOf course, a fresh brand can easily backfire without fundamental changes to\nthe business outcomes driven by HR. The challenges that come with the three\nfutures described above are plentiful. Yet with challenge comes opportunity,\nand HR has the chance to drive tangible impact as organizations face the\nfutures of enterprise, workforce, and how work gets done.\n\nHR must step into a new future by shifting in four areas:\n\n\u2022 **Mind-set:** The future is calling for new capabilities. HR teams across\norganizations of all sizes and industries have been steadily growing their\ncapabilities, as Deloitte\u2019s Global Human Capital Trends report has shown over\nthe past few years. As so many leaders across businesses have discovered, HR\nleaders also recognize the importance of operating with agility and fluidity\nacross organizations, breaking down silos, and fostering intentional\ncollaboration with a spirit of disrupting old solutions. The digital age\ndemands even further capability of growth for sustained success in the future.\nThe ability and cultural readiness to fail fast but learn faster and\ncontinuously innovate new solutions are among the most critical to mastering a\nnew mind-set for the future of HR in order to drive the value that enterprises\nrequire. As artificial intelligence, robotics, and cognitive solutions grow in\nsophistication, the nature and typology of work will continue to change.\nOrganizations must reconsider how they design jobs, organize work, and plan\nfor future growth.\n\n\u2022 **Focus:** Workforce engagement and satisfaction are table stakes.\nContinued, proactive efforts in employee engagement and satisfaction remain\nimportant. Yet success in the future demands broadening the scope to consider\nengagement and satisfaction of an enterprise\u2019s full workforce in a world where\nnontraditional employment constructs are exploding. A customer-centric focus\nin the future of HR requires workforce-centered solutions that apply\npersonalization wisely in a scalable way as part of creating a Simply\nIrresistible Organization\u2122. The future of HR moves beyond quantitative value\nand instead focuses on driving tangible, measurable value that is both\nqualitative and quantitative across the enterprise.\n\n\u2022 **Lens:** High-Impact HR Operating Model at the core. Many leading\norganizations implemented a High-Impact HR Operating Model by moving toward\ncommunities of expertise, business HR, HR operational services, and governance\nwith joint HR and business leaders. These moves are foundational to the future\nof HR. Yet the future demands re-imagining work, advancing beyond\norganizational structure shifts, and moving toward continuous improvements in\nhow work gets done in order to meet the constant disruptions to the\nenterprise. In this new world, the pace of change demands a strong ecosystem\nof partners to build upon and enable internal capabilities with speed while\ncreating new channels for talent and innovation. Networks of agile teams\nwithin HR can advance Communities of Expertise by driving collaboration across\nall parts of the HR function. The HR operating model of the future increases\nempowerment of managers and leaders to engage with the workforce and to\nparticipate in the curating of a workforce experience that grows skills that\nleaders anticipate as important to the future of the enterprise. The external\necosystem of customers, suppliers, and the society where enterprises operate\nis one of important stakeholders and collaborators in the future of HR.\n\n\u2022 **Enablers:** Cloud/SaaS platforms by themselves are not enough. While HR\nhas blazed new trails through its early adoption of cloud platform solutions,\nautomating and enhancing with advanced digital solutions that reshape how work\ngets done is imperative. Many have begun to apply robotic process automation\nand even artificial intelligence technologies to traditional HR activities.\nThe introduction of virtual reality, machine learning, and social\ncollaboration can make it possible to truly reinvent rather than only\nautomate. Achieving this is only valuable if it is easy and intuitive for the\ncustomers of HR, and is brought together through a unified engagement\nplatform, avoiding a patchwork quilt of solutions\u2015an all-too-easy trap given\nthe temptation to implement individually innovative solutions without a\nthoughtful, yet iterative, road map.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/02/us-human-capital-future-of-\nhr.png)\n\nChange is messy, and there is rarely a straight line to follow from the\npresent to the future. Each HR organization will have a different starting\npoint for the future of HR, and definitions of a successful future will vary.\nRoadblocks will appear that will force you to take unexpected turns, and it\nmay feel as though your progress is slower than desired at certain points\nalong the way.\n\nWhile each evolution to the future of HR will differ, class transformational\napproaches need not apply.

They quickly\nembraced what Ralph Hamers, CEO of the global banking group ING, calls\n\"banking on the go.\"\n\nBy 2014 about 40% of all interactions with ING retail customers were coming in\nthrough mobile apps. (Now the figure is closer to 60%--and branch visits and\ncalls to contact centers have dropped below 1%.) Even then mobile customers\nexpected easy access to up-to-date information whenever and wherever they\nlogged in. For instance, someone who started a loan transaction during the\ntrain ride home from work wanted to be able to continue it on a desktop that\nnight. \"Our customers were spending most of their online time on platforms\nlike Facebook and Netflix,\" says Hamers. \"Those set the standard for user\nexperience.\"\n\nThat meant ING needed to become nimbler and more user-focused to serve its 30\nmillion-plus customers across the world at every point in their financial\njourneys. So Hamers worked with Nick Jue, then the CEO of ING's Netherlands\ngroup, to launch a pilot transformation in the headquarters of ING's largest\nunit, its Dutch retail operations. The first step was to help other senior\nleaders and the board envision a new agile, team-based system for deploying,\ndeveloping, and assessing talent. (ING had already adopted agile and scrum\nmethodologies in its Dutch IT unit, but those ways of working were new to\nother parts of the organization.) Hamers and his leadership team then met with\npeople at tech companies they admired, learning how their talent systems\nenabled better customer service. By the spring of 2015 the headquarters of ING\nNetherlands, home to some 3,500 full-time employees, had replaced most of its\ntraditional structure with a fluid, agile organization composed of _tribes,\nsquads,_ and _chapters._\n\n#### Tribes, Squads, and Chapters\n\nING's new agile system for deploying talent and managing performance organizes\npeople by domain, customer need, and function. After experimenting with this\nstructure in its Dutch retail unit, the company decided to roll it out more\nbroadly.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_TRIBES.png)\n\nThirteen tribes were created to address specific domains, such as mortgage\nservices, securities, and private banking. Each tribe contains up to 150\npeople. (Employees in sales, service, and support functions work outside this\nstructure--in smaller customer-loyalty teams, for instance--but they\ncollaborate with the tribes.) And each has a lead who establishes priorities,\nallocates budgets, and ensures that knowledge and insights are shared both\nwithin and across tribes.\n\nThe tribe lead has one other critical responsibility: to create, with input\nfrom tribe members, self-steering squads of nine or fewer people to address\nspecific customer needs by delivering and maintaining new products and\nservices. These squads are cross-disciplinary--typically, a mix of marketing\nspecialists, data analysts, user-experience designers, IT engineers, and\nproduct specialists. One squad member is designated the \"product owner,\"\nresponsible for coordinating activities and setting priorities. The squad\nstays together as long as is required to meet the customer need from start to\nfinish--whether it is, for example, improving user experience on the mobile\napp or building a particular feature. Some tasks are completed in two weeks;\nothers might take 18 months. Sometimes the squads disband and the members join\nother ones. Most often, however, squads that are working well stay together\nand move on to address other customer needs.\n\nBy working in such small units and with colleagues from various disciplines,\nsquad members can quickly resolve issues that might previously have bounced\nfrom department to department. Information sharing is encouraged through\nmechanisms such as scrums and daily stand-ups--the kinds of gatherings you'd\nfind at a tech start-up. Seeing a project through from start to finish gives\neach squad a sense of ownership and connection to the customer.\n\nImplementing an agile talent system doesn't mean embracing chaos. In fact, a\nsystem that's well designed observes clearly defined rules and safeguards to\nensure institutional stability. Every tribe, for example, has a couple of\nagile coaches to help squads and individuals collaborate effectively in an\nenvironment where employees are encouraged to solve problems on the ground\nrather than pass them on to someone else. Although you might think adapting\nwould be most difficult for long-term bank employees, that's not so, according\nto ING Netherlands CIO Peter Jacobs. Many of them \"adapted even more quickly\nand more readily than the younger generation,\" he says, perhaps because their\nexpertise now has more impact than in the past, when so many sign-offs were\nrequired.\n\nWorking in small, cross-functional units, squads can resolve issues quickly.\n\nThen there are the chapters, which coordinate members of the same discipline--\ndata analytics, say, or systems processes--who are scattered among squads.\nChapter leads are responsible for tracking and sharing best practices and for\nsuch things as professional development and performance reviews. Think of\nchapters as a way of retaining the helpful parts of traditional management\neven while dispensing with time-consuming handoffs and bureaucracy.\n\nRegular assessments are built into the system. Every two weeks squads review\ntheir work. Says Hamers, \"They get to decide how they will continue to improve\nthe product for our customers, or if they want to 'fail fast.'\" (Learning from\nfailure is applauded.) Squads also do a thorough self-assessment after\ncompleting any engagement, and tribes perform quarterly business reviews\n(QBRs), looking at their biggest successes and failures, reviewing their most\nimportant learnings, and articulating goals for the next three months.\n\nThese safeguards help counter what Vincent van den Boogert, the current CEO of\nING Netherlands (and part of the team that launched the new organizational\nstructure), sees as the two biggest challenges of a squad-based system. One is\nthe possibility that self-empowered squads responding primarily to the needs\nof customers might embark on changes that aren't in sync with company\nstrategy. The QBRs mitigate that risk. The second challenge is somewhat\ncounterintuitive. Self-evaluating squads are sometimes content with the\nincremental improvements they make every two weeks. The QBRs help in that\nregard, too, because top management uses them to formulate and reinforce\nstretch goals.\n\nMore than two years in, Hamers considers the talent experiment a big success.\nCustomer satisfaction and employee engagement are both up, and ING is quicker\nto market with new products. So the bank has started to roll out this new way\nof working to the roughly 40,000 employees outside its home country. For\nHamers, the change can't come soon enough. The apps for each of ING's 13\nretail markets vary in appearance, design, and function. Hamers wants to make\nthings much simpler so that any customer, anywhere, will encounter the same\nING. \"Tech companies have one platform across the globe,\" he says. \"No matter\nwhere you use Netflix, Facebook, or Google, you get the same service. ING must\ndo the same. That is the only way we will bring all our customers along into\nthe future of banking.\"\n\n## HR Goes Agile\n\n  * [Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter%20cappelli)\n  * [Anna Tavis](/search?term=anna%20tavis)\n\n  * __Save\n  * __Share\n\nAgile isn't just for tech anymore. It's [been working its way into other areas\nand functions](/2016/05/embracing-agile), from product development to\nmanufacturing to marketing--and now it's transforming how organizations hire,\ndevelop, and manage their people.\n\nYou could say HR is going \"agile lite,\" applying the general principles\nwithout adopting all the tools and protocols from the tech world. It's a move\naway from a rules- and planning-based approach toward a simpler and faster\nmodel driven by feedback from participants. This new paradigm has really taken\noff in the area of performance management. (In a [2017 Deloitte\nsurvey](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/lu/Documents/human-\ncapital/lu-hc-2017-global-human-capital-trends-gx.pdf), 79% of global\nexecutives rated agile performance management as a high organizational\npriority.) But other HR processes are starting to change too.\n\nIn many companies that's happening gradually, almost organically, as a\nspillover from IT, where more than 90% of organizations already use agile\npractices. At the Bank of Montreal (BMO), for example, the shift began as tech\nemployees joined cross-functional product-development teams to make the bank\nmore customer focused. The business side has learned agile principles from IT\ncolleagues, and IT has learned about customer needs from the business. One\nresult is that BMO now thinks about performance management in terms of teams,\nnot just individuals. Elsewhere the move to agile HR has been faster and more\ndeliberate. GE is a prime example. Seen for many years as a paragon of\nmanagement through control systems, it switched to FastWorks, a lean approach\nthat cuts back on top-down financial controls and empowers teams to manage\nprojects as needs evolve.\n\nThe changes in HR have been a long time coming. After World War II, when\nmanufacturing dominated the industrial landscape, planning was at the heart of\nhuman resources: Companies recruited lifers, gave them rotational assignments\nto support their development, groomed them years in advance to take on bigger\nand bigger roles, and tied their raises directly to each incremental move up\nthe ladder. The bureaucracy was the point: Organizations wanted their talent\npractices to be rules-based and internally consistent so that they could\nreliably meet five-year (and sometimes 15-year) plans. That made sense. Every\nother aspect of companies, from core businesses to administrative functions,\ntook the long view in their goal setting, budgeting, and operations. HR\nreflected and supported what they were doing.\n\nBy the 1990s, as business became less predictable and companies needed to\nacquire new skills fast, that traditional approach began to bend--but it\ndidn't quite break. Lateral hiring from the outside--to get more flexibility--\nreplaced a good deal of the internal development and promotions. \"Broadband\"\ncompensation gave managers greater latitude to reward people for growth and\nachievement within roles. For the most part, though, the old model persisted.\nLike other functions, HR was still built around the long term. Workforce and\nsuccession planning carried on, even though changes in the economy and in the\nbusiness often rendered those plans irrelevant. Annual appraisals continued,\ndespite almost universal dissatisfaction with them.\n\nNow we're seeing a more sweeping transformation. Why is this the moment for\nit? Because rapid innovation has become a strategic imperative for most\ncompanies, not just a subset. To get it, businesses have looked to Silicon\nValley and to software companies in particular, emulating their agile\npractices for managing projects. So top-down planning models are giving way to\nnimbler, user-driven methods that are better suited for adapting in the near\nterm, such as rapid prototyping, iterative feedback, team-based decisions, and\ntask-centered \"sprints.\" As BMO's chief transformation officer, Lynn Roger,\nputs it, \"Speed is the new business currency.\"\n\nWith the business justification for the old HR systems gone and the agile\nplaybook available to copy, people management is finally getting its long-\nawaited overhaul too. In this article we'll illustrate some of the profound\nchanges companies are making in their talent practices and describe the\nchallenges they face in their transition to agile HR.\n\n## Where We're Seeing the Biggest Changes\n\nBecause HR touches every aspect--and every employee--of an organization, its\nagile transformation may be even more extensive (and more difficult) than the\nchanges in other functions. Companies are redesigning their talent practices\nin the following areas:\n\n### Performance appraisals.\n\nWhen businesses adopted agile methods in their core operations, they dropped\nthe charade of trying to plan a year or more in advance how projects would go\nand when they would end. So in many cases the first traditional HR practice to\ngo was the annual performance review, along with employee goals that\n\"cascaded\" down from business and unit objectives each year. As individuals\nworked on shorter-term projects of various lengths, often run by different\nleaders and organized around teams, the notion that performance feedback would\ncome once a year, from one boss, made little sense. They needed more of it,\nmore often, from more people.\n\n[An early-days CEB\nsurvey](https://www.cebglobal.com/content/dam/cebglobal/us/EN/best-practices-\ndecision-support/human-resources/pdfs/eliminate-performance-ratings.pdf)\nsuggested that people actually got _less_ feedback and support when their\nemployers dropped annual reviews. However, that's because many companies put\nnothing in their place. Managers felt no pressing need to adopt a new feedback\nmodel and shifted their attention to other priorities. But dropping appraisals\nwithout a plan to fill the void was of course a recipe for failure.\n\nSince learning that hard lesson, many organizations have switched to frequent\nperformance assessments, often conducted project by project. This change has\nspread to a number of industries, including retail (Gap), big pharma (Pfizer),\ninsurance (Cigna), investing (OppenheimerFunds), consumer products (P&G), and\naccounting (all Big Four firms). It is most famous at GE, across the firm's\nrange of businesses, and at IBM. Overall, the focus is on delivering more-\nimmediate feedback throughout the year so that teams can become nimbler,\n\"course-correct\" mistakes, improve performance, and learn through iteration--\nall key agile principles.\n\nIn user-centered fashion, managers and employees have had a hand in shaping,\ntesting, and refining new processes. For instance, Johnson & Johnson offered\nits businesses the chance to participate in an experiment: They could try out\na new continual-feedback process, using a customized app with which employees,\npeers, and bosses could exchange comments in real time.\n\nThe new process was an attempt to move away from J&J's event-driven \"five\nconversations\" framework (which focused on goal setting, career discussion, a\nmidyear performance review, a year-end appraisal, and a compensation review)\nand toward a model of ongoing dialogue. Those who tried it were asked to share\nhow well everything worked, what the bugs were, and so on. The experiment\nlasted three months. At first only 20% of the managers in the pilot actively\nparticipated. The inertia from prior years of annual appraisals was hard to\novercome. But then the company used training to show managers what good\nfeedback could look like and designated \"change champions\" to model the\ndesired behaviors on their teams. By the end of the three months, 46% of\nmanagers in the pilot group had joined in, exchanging 3,000 pieces of\nfeedback.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals, a fast-growing biotech company, is going even\nfurther with its appraisals overhaul. Michelle Weitzman-Garcia, Regeneron's\nhead of workforce development, argued that the performance of the scientists\nworking on drug development, the product supply group, the field sales force,\nand the corporate functions should not be measured on the same cycle or in the\nsame way. She observed that these employee groups needed varying feedback and\nthat they even operated on different calendars.\n\n#### Why Intuit's Transition to Agile Almost Stalled Out\n\nThe financial services division at Intuit began shifting to agile in 2009--but\nfour years went by before that became standard operating procedure across the\ncompany.\n\nWhat took so long? Leaders started with a \"waterfall\" approach to change\nmanagement, because that's what they knew best. It didn't work. Spotty support\nfrom middle management, part-time commitments to the team leading the\ntransformation, scarce administrative resources, and an extended planning\ncycle all put a big drag on the rollout.\n\nBefore agile could gain traction throughout the organization, the transition\nteam needed to take an agile approach to _becoming_ agile and managing the\nchange. Looking back, Joumana Youssef, one of Intuit's strategic-change\nleaders, identifies several critical discoveries that changed the course--and\nthe speed--of the transformation:\n\n  * Focus on early adopters. Don't waste time trying to convert naysayers.\n  * Form \"triple-S\" (small, stable, self-managed) teams, give them ownership of their work, and hold them accountable for their commitments.\n  * Quickly train leaders at all levels in agile methods. Agile teams need to be fully supported to self-manage.\n  * Expect that changing frontline and middle management will be hard, because people in those roles need time to acclimate to \"servant leadership,\" which is primarily about coaching and supporting employees rather than monitoring them.\n  * Stay the course. Even though agile change is faster than a waterfall approach, shifting your organization's mindset takes persistence.\n\nSo the company created four distinct appraisal processes, tailored to the\nvarious groups' needs. The research scientists and postdocs, for example,\ncrave metrics and are keen on assessing competencies, so they meet with\nmanagers twice a year for competency evaluations and milestones reviews.\nCustomer-facing groups include feedback from clients and customers in their\nassessments. Although having to manage four separate processes adds\ncomplexity, they all reinforce the new norm of continual feedback. And\nWeitzman-Garcia says the benefits to the organization far outweigh the costs\nto HR.\n\n### Coaching.\n\nThe companies that most effectively adopt agile talent practices invest in\nsharpening managers' coaching skills. Supervisors at Cigna go through \"coach\"\ntraining designed for busy managers: It's broken into weekly 90-minute videos\nthat can be viewed as people have time. The supervisors also engage in\nlearning sessions, which, like \"learning sprints\" in agile project management,\nare brief and spread out to allow individuals to reflect and test-drive new\nskills on the job. Peer-to-peer feedback is incorporated in Cigna's manager\ntraining too: Colleagues form learning cohorts to share ideas and tactics.\nThey're having the kinds of conversations companies want supervisors to have\nwith their direct reports, but they feel freer to share mistakes with one\nanother, without the fear of \"evaluation\" hanging over their heads.\n\nDigitalOcean, a New York-based start-up focused on software as a service\n(SaaS) infrastructure, engages a full-time professional coach on-site to help\nall managers give better feedback to employees and, more broadly, to develop\ninternal coaching capabilities. The idea is that once one experiences good\ncoaching, one becomes a better coach. Not everyone is expected to become a\ngreat coach--those in the company who prefer coding to coaching can advance\nalong a technical career track--but coaching skills are considered central to\na managerial career.\n\nP&G, too, is intent on making managers better coaches. That's part of a larger\neffort to rebuild training and development for supervisors and enhance their\nrole in the organization. By simplifying the performance review process,\nseparating evaluation from development discussions, and eliminating talent\ncalibration sessions (the arbitrary horse trading between supervisors that\noften comes with a subjective and politicized ranking model), P&G has freed up\na lot of time to devote to employees' growth. But getting supervisors to move\nfrom judging employees to coaching them in their day-to-day work has been a\nchallenge in P&G's tradition-rich culture. So the company has invested heavily\nin training supervisors on topics such as how to establish employees'\npriorities and goals, how to provide feedback about contributions, and how to\nalign employees' career aspirations with business needs and learning and\ndevelopment plans. The bet is that building employees' capabilities and\nrelationships with supervisors will increase engagement and therefore help the\ncompany innovate and move faster. Even though the jury is still out on the\ncompanywide culture shift, P&G is already reporting improvements in these\nareas, at all levels of management.\n\n### Teams.\n\nTraditional HR focused on individuals--their goals, their performance, their\nneeds. But now that so many companies are organizing their work project by\nproject, their management and talent systems are becoming more team focused.\nGroups are creating, executing, and revising their goals and tasks with scrums\n--at the team level, in the moment, to adapt quickly to new information as it\ncomes in. (\"Scrum\" may be the best-known term in the agile lexicon. It comes\nfrom rugby, where players pack tightly together to restart play.) They are\nalso taking it upon themselves to track their own progress, identify\nobstacles, assess their leadership, and generate insights about how to improve\nperformance.\n\nIn that context, organizations must learn to contend with:\n\n_Multidirectional feedback._ Peer feedback is essential to course corrections\nand employee development in an agile environment, because team members know\nbetter than anyone else what each person is contributing. It's rarely a formal\nprocess, and comments are generally directed to the employee, not the\nsupervisor. That keeps input constructive and prevents the [undermining of\ncolleagues](http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employees-reportedly-slam-\neach-other-through-this-internal-review-tool-2015-8) that sometimes occurs in\nhypercompetitive workplaces.\n\nBut some executives believe that peer feedback should have an impact on\nperformance evaluations. Diane Gherson, IBM's head of HR, explains that \"the\nrelationships between managers and employees change in the context of a\nnetwork [the collection of projects across which employees work].\" Because an\nagile environment makes it practically impossible to \"monitor\" performance in\nthe old sense, managers at IBM solicit input from others to help them identify\nand address issues early on. Unless it's sensitive, that input is shared in\nthe team's daily stand-up meetings and captured in an app. Employees may\nchoose whether to include managers and others in their comments to peers. The\nrisk of cutthroat behavior is mitigated by the fact that peer comments to the\nsupervisor also go to the team. Anyone trying to undercut colleagues will be\nexposed.\n\nIn agile organizations, \"upward\" feedback from employees to team leaders and\nsupervisors is highly valued too. The Mitre Corporation's not-for-profit\nresearch centers have taken steps to encourage it, but they're finding that\nthis requires concentrated effort. They started with periodic confidential\nemployee surveys and focus groups to discover which issues people wanted to\ndiscuss with their managers. HR then distilled that data for supervisors to\ninform their conversations with direct reports. However, employees were\ninitially hesitant to provide upward feedback--even though it was anonymous\nand was used for development purposes only--because they weren't accustomed to\nvoicing their thoughts about what management was doing.\n\nMitre also learned that the most critical factor in getting subordinates to be\ncandid was having managers explicitly say that they wanted and appreciated\ncomments. Otherwise people might worry, reasonably, that their leaders weren't\nreally open to feedback and ready to apply it. As with any employee survey,\nsoliciting upward feedback and not acting on it has a diminishing effect on\nparticipation; it erodes the hard-earned trust between employees and their\nmanagers. When Mitre's new performance-management and feedback process began,\nthe CEO acknowledged that the research centers would need to iterate and make\nimprovements. A revised system for upward feedback will roll out this year.\n\nBecause feedback flows in all directions on teams, many companies use\ntechnology to manage the sheer volume of it. Apps allow supervisors,\ncoworkers, and clients to give one another immediate feedback from wherever\nthey are. Crucially, supervisors can download all the comments later on, when\nit's time to do evaluations. In some apps, employees and supervisors can score\nprogress on goals; at least one helps managers analyze conversations on\nproject management platforms like Slack to provide feedback on collaboration.\nCisco uses proprietary technology to collect weekly raw data, or\n\"breadcrumbs,\" from employees about their peers' performance. Such tools\nenable managers to see fluctuations in individual performance over time, even\nwithin teams. The apps don't provide an official record of performance, of\ncourse, and employees may want to discuss problems face-to-face to avoid\nhaving them recorded in a file that can be downloaded. We know that [companies\nrecognize and reward\nimprovement](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265063411_What_Do_Performance_Appraisals_Do)\nas well as actual performance, however, so hiding problems may not always pay\noff for employees.\n\n_Frontline decision rights._ The fundamental shift toward teams has also\naffected decision rights: Organizations are pushing them down to the front\nlines, equipping and empowering employees to operate more independently. But\nthat's a huge behavioral change, and people need support to pull it off. Let's\nreturn to the Bank of Montreal example to illustrate how it can work. When BMO\nintroduced agile teams to design some new customer services, senior leaders\nweren't quite ready to give up control, and the people under them were not\nused to taking it. So the bank embedded agile coaches in business teams. They\nbegan by putting everyone, including high-level executives, through\n\"retrospectives\"--regular reflection and feedback sessions held after each\niteration. These are the agile version of after-action reviews; their purpose\nis to keep improving processes. Because the retrospectives quickly identified\nconcrete successes, failures, and root causes, senior leaders at BMO\nimmediately recognized their value, which helped them get on board with agile\ngenerally and loosen their grip on decision making.\n\n_Complex team dynamics._ Finally, since the supervisor's role has moved away\nfrom just managing individuals and toward the much more complicated task of\npromoting productive, healthy team dynamics, people often need help with that,\ntoo. Cisco's special Team Intelligence unit provides that kind of support.\nIt's charged with identifying the company's best-performing teams, analyzing\nhow they operate, and helping other teams learn how to become more like them.\nIt uses an enterprise-wide platform called Team Space, which tracks data on\nteam projects, needs, and achievements to both measure and improve what teams\nare doing within units and across the company.\n\n### Compensation.\n\nPay is changing as well. A simple adaptation to agile work, seen in retail\ncompanies such as Macy's, is to use spot bonuses to recognize contributions\nwhen they happen rather than rely solely on end-of-year salary increases.\n[Research and practice](https://ceo.usc.edu/files/2016/09/CE_PM_FINAL.pdf)\nhave shown that compensation works best as a motivator when it comes as soon\nas possible after the desired behavior. Instant rewards reinforce instant\nfeedback in a powerful way. Annual merit-based raises are less effective,\nbecause too much time goes by.\n\nPatagonia has actually eliminated annual raises for its knowledge workers.\nInstead the company adjusts wages for each job much more frequently, according\nto research on where market rates are going. Increases can also be allocated\nwhen employees take on more-difficult projects or go above and beyond in other\nways. The company retains a budget for the top 1% of individual contributors,\nand supervisors can make a case for any contribution that merits that\ndesignation, including contributions to teams.\n\nUpward feedback from employees to team leaders is valued in agile\norganizations.\n\nCompensation is also being used to reinforce agile values such as learning and\nknowledge sharing. In the start-up world, for instance, the online clothing-\nrental company Rent the Runway dropped separate bonuses, rolling the money\ninto base pay. CEO Jennifer Hyman reports that the bonus program was getting\nin the way of honest peer feedback. Employees weren't sharing constructive\ncriticism, knowing it could have negative financial consequences for their\ncolleagues. The new system prevents that problem by \"untangling the two, \"\nHyman says.\n\nDigitalOcean redesigned its rewards to promote equitable treatment of\nemployees and a culture of collaboration. Salary adjustments now happen twice\na year to respond to changes in the outside labor market and in jobs and\nperformance. More important, DigitalOcean has closed gaps in pay for\nequivalent work. It's deliberately heading off internal rivalry, painfully\naware of the problems in hypercompetitive cultures (think Microsoft and\nAmazon). To personalize compensation, the firm maps where people are having\nimpact in their roles and where they need to grow and develop. The data on\nindividuals' impact on the business is a key factor in discussions about pay.\nNegotiating to raise your own salary is fiercely discouraged. And only the top\n1% of achievement is rewarded financially; otherwise, there is no merit-pay\nprocess. All employees are eligible for bonuses, which are based on company\nperformance rather than individual contributions. To further support\ncollaboration, DigitalOcean is diversifying its portfolio of rewards to\ninclude nonfinancial, meaningful gifts, such as a Kindle loaded with the CEO's\n\"best books\" picks.\n\nHow does DigitalOcean motivate people to perform their best without inflated\nfinancial rewards? Matt Hoffman, its vice president of people, says it focuses\non creating a culture that inspires purpose and creativity. So far that seems\nto be working. The latest engagement survey, via Culture Amp, ranks\nDigitalOcean 17 points above the industry benchmark in satisfaction with\ncompensation.\n\n### Recruiting.\n\nWith the improvements in the economy since the Great Recession, recruiting and\nhiring have become more urgent--and more agile. To scale up quickly in 2015,\nGE's new digital division pioneered some interesting recruiting experiments.\nFor instance, a cross-functional team works together on all hiring\nrequisitions. A \"head count manager\" represents the interests of internal\nstakeholders who want their positions filled quickly and appropriately. Hiring\nmanagers rotate on and off the team, depending on whether they're currently\nhiring, and a scrum master oversees the process.\n\nTo keep things moving, the team focuses on vacancies that have cleared all the\nhurdles--no req's get started if debate is still ongoing about the desired\nattributes of candidates. Openings are ranked, and the team concentrates on\nthe top-priority hires until they are completed. It works on several hires at\nonce so that members can share information about candidates who may fit better\nin other roles. The team keeps track of its cycle time for filling positions\nand monitors all open requisitions on a kanban board to identify bottlenecks\nand blocked processes. IBM now takes a similar approach to recruitment.\n\nCompanies are also relying more heavily on technology to find and track\ncandidates who are well suited to an agile work environment. GE, IBM, and\nCisco are working with the vendor Ascendify to create software that does just\nthis. The IT recruiting company HackerRank offers an online tool for the same\npurpose.\n\n### Learning and development.\n\nLike hiring, L&D had to change to bring new skills into organizations more\nquickly. Most companies already have a suite of online learning modules that\nemployees can access on demand. Although helpful for those who have clearly\ndefined needs, this is a bit like giving a student the key to a library and\ntelling her to figure out what she must know and then learn it. Newer\napproaches use data analysis to identify the skills required for particular\njobs and for advancement and then suggest to individual employees what kinds\nof training and future jobs make sense for them, given their experience and\ninterests.\n\nIBM uses artificial intelligence to generate such advice, starting with\nemployees' profiles, which include prior and current roles, expected career\ntrajectory, and training programs completed. The company has also created\nspecial training for agile environments--using, for example, animated\nsimulations built around a series of \"personas\" to illustrate useful\nbehaviors, such as offering constructive criticism.\n\n#### What HR Can Learn from Tech\n\nThe agile pioneers in the tech world are years ahead of everyone else in\nadopting the methodology at scale. So who better to provide guidance as\nmanagers and HR leaders grapple with how to apply agile talent practices\nthroughout their organizations? In a recent survey, thousands of software\ndevelopers across many countries and industries identified their biggest\nobstacles in scaling and the ways they got past them.\n\n![R1802B_SPOT_WHATHRCANLEARN](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_WHATHRCANLEARN.png)\n\nFind this and other HBR graphics in our [Visual Library __](/visual-\nlibrary/2018/03/what-hr-can-learn-from-tech)\n\nTraditionally, L&D has included succession planning--the epitome of top-down,\nlong-range thinking, whereby individuals are picked years in advance to take\non the most crucial leadership roles, usually in the hope that they will\ndevelop certain capabilities on schedule. The world often fails to cooperate\nwith those plans, though. Companies routinely find that by the time senior\nleadership positions open up, their needs have changed. The most common\nsolution is to ignore the plan and start a search from scratch. But\norganizations often continue doing long-term succession planning anyway.\n([About half](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-\nresearch/publications/2010-ceo-succession-planning-survey) of large companies\nhave a plan to develop successors for the top job.) Pepsi is one company\ntaking a simple step away from this model by shortening the time frame. It\nprovides brief quarterly updates on the development of possible successors--in\ncontrast to the usual annual updates--and delays appointments so that they\nhappen closer to when successors are likely to step into their roles.\n\n## Ongoing Challenges\n\nTo be sure, not every organization or group is in hot pursuit of rapid\ninnovation. Some jobs must remain largely rules based. (Consider the work that\naccountants, nuclear control-room operators, and surgeons do.) In such cases\nagile talent practices may not make sense.\n\nAnd even when they're appropriate, they may meet resistance--especially within\nHR. A lot of processes have to change for an organization to move away from a\nplanning-based, \"waterfall\" model (which is linear rather than flexible and\nadaptive), and some of them are hardwired into information systems, job\ntitles, and so forth. The move toward cloud-based IT, which is happening\nindependently, has made it easier to adopt app-based tools. But people issues\nremain a sticking point. Many HR tasks, such as traditional approaches to\nrecruitment, onboarding, and program coordination, will become obsolete, as\nwill expertise in those areas.\n\nMeanwhile, new tasks are being created. Helping supervisors replace judging\nwith coaching is a big challenge not just in terms of skills but also because\nit undercuts their status and formal authority. Shifting the focus of\nmanagement from individuals to teams may be even more difficult, because team\ndynamics can be a black box to those who are still struggling to understand\nhow to coach individuals. The big question is whether companies can help\nmanagers take all this on and see the value in it.\n\nThe HR function will also require reskilling. It will need more expertise in\nIT support--especially given all the performance data generated by the new\napps--and deeper knowledge about teams and hands-on supervision. HR has not\nhad to change in recent decades nearly as much as have the line operations it\nsupports. But now the pressure is on, and it's coming from the operating\nlevel, which makes it much harder to cling to old talent practices.\n\n* * *\n\n[Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter+cappelli) is the George W.

Diane Gherson, the chief human resources officer at IBM, recently\nspoke with HBR about how that's playing out as the iconic tech company revamps\nits business model. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nHBR: In what sense is IBM putting employee experience at the center of people\nmanagement?\n\nGHERSON: Like a lot of other companies, we started with the belief that if\npeople felt great about working with us, our clients would too. That wasn't a\nnew thought, but it's certainly one we took very seriously, going back about\nfour or five years. We've since seen it borne out. We've found that employee\nengagement explains two-thirds of our client experience scores. And if we're\nable to increase client satisfaction by five points on an account, we see an\nextra 20% in revenue, on average. So clearly there's an impact. That's the\nbusiness case for the change.\n\nBut it has required a shift in mindset. Before, we tended to rely on experts\nto build our HR programs. Now we bring employees into the design process, co-\ncreate with them, and iterate over time so that we meet people's needs.\n\n![R1802B_SPOT_MONTANA.jpg](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_MONTANA.jpg)\n\nSally Montana\n\nDiane Gherson, IBM's head of HR\n\nWhat does that look like in practice?\n\nA good example is employee onboarding--the first process we took a very hard\nlook at. We knew we wanted people to walk out thinking, \"I'm superexcited I'm\nhere, and I understand what I need to know to get going.\" But we started too\nsmall. We approached it in a traditional way that made it all about the\norientation class, all about the experience you have on your first day. Once\nwe began asking new hires how their onboarding had gone, we heard things like\n\"I didn't get my laptop on time,\" or \"I couldn't get my credit card in time to\nget to my first meeting,\" or \"I had problems accessing the internal network.\"\nAll those things affect how someone feels about having joined the company.\n\nOnce you realize that, the remit for the onboarding team becomes how people\nexperience the whole process, end to end. To get it right, you have to work\nwith a broader set of players. You bring in Security to make sure the ID\nbadges are there. You bring in Real Estate to make sure people have a physical\nspace and know where to go. You bring in Networking to make sure their remote\naccess is up and running. All that is part of onboarding. It's not just having\na great meeting with a bunch of other new hires on your first day.\n\nIt took a while for us to understand that. You have to broaden your scope and\nstop thinking in silos in order to create a great employee experience.\n\nHow has IBM's approach to learning and development changed?\n\nPeople consume content on their phones and tablets now--they use YouTube and\nTED talks to get up to speed on things they don't know. So we had to put aside\nour traditional learning-management system and think differently about\neducation and development. Again, we brought in our Millennials, brought in\nour users, and codesigned a learning platform that is individually\npersonalized for every one of our 380,000 IBMers.\n\nIt's tailored by role, with intelligent recommendations that are continually\nupdated. And it's organized sort of like Netflix, with different channels. You\ncan see how others have rated the various offerings. There's also a live-chat\nadviser, who helps learners in the moment.\n\nWe measure HR offerings such as learning with a Net Promoter Score--the\nultimate metric for an irresistible experience. Before, we used a classic\nfive-point satisfaction scale. Even if someone rated you a 3.1, you ended up\nsaying they were satisfied, whereas with Net Promoter, you have to be at the\nfar end of the scale for it to mean anything, because you have to subtract all\nthe detractors. It's much harder to get that, and it gives you much better\nfeedback on what people are experiencing. For learning, at last count, our NPS\nwas 60. That's in the \"excellent\" range, but of course there's still room to\nimprove.\n\nWhat kinds of tools do you use to customize learning?\n\nWith Watson Analytics, we're able to infer people's expertise from their\ndigital footprint inside the company, and we compare that with where they\nshould be in their particular job family. The system is cognitive, so it knows\nyou--it has ingested the data about your skills and is able to give you\npersonalized learning recommendations. It tells you, \"OK, you need to increase\nyour depth in these areas--and here are the offerings that will help you do\nthat.\" You can then pin those or queue them up in your calendar for future\nlearning. The system also looks at how close you may be to earning a digital\nbadge, which we've started using in just the past couple of years to\ndemonstrate which employees have applied skills. The tool then helps you\nachieve the badge by recommending specific webinars and internal and external\ncourses. It's all based on artificial intelligence. Skills inference is at\nabout 96% accuracy at this point.\n\n\"People are less likely to resist change when they've had a hand in shaping\nit.\"\n\nHow do you know that?\n\nWe used to have this laborious manual process of getting people to fill out\nskills questionnaires and having their managers sign off on them. But that\ngets outdated really fast. So we stopped doing that. Instead, leaders in\nparticular job families or industries do spot checks on how well we are\ninferring. They interview employees and identify where they are, comparing\nthat with what the inference was in our system.\n\nIBM has given its performance management system an overhaul as well. How have\nemployees been involved in that process?\n\nAs you know, performance management is kind of a lightning rod in most\ncompanies. Rather than do the typical thing--which would be to do some\nbenchmarking, pull together a bunch of experts, come up with a new design, and\npilot it--we decided to go all out and co-create it with our employees in a\nsort of extended hackathon. We used design thinking and came up with what you\nmight describe as a \"concept car\"--something for people to test drive and kick\nthe tires on, instead of just dealing with concepts. We did that in the summer\nof 2015 and implemented it across the company five months later. That's the\npower of engaging the whole workforce--people are much less likely to resist\nthe change when they've had a hand in shaping it.\n\nTo start the co-creation process, I blogged about it one day and said, \"We'd\nlove your input. If you hate it, we'll start over, no problem. But we really\nwant your thoughts.\" We made a few videos about what we thought it might look\nlike. I got 18,000 responses overnight. Fortunately, we had the technology to\nanalyze it all and see what people liked and didn't like.\n\nAt first some people said, \"This is such a sham--you already know what you\nwant to do.\" But we explained that we really wanted to hear from them, and we\ngot them into various discussion forums. It took a while, but I think we did\nturn them around. We kept communicating, saying, \"OK, you liked this; you\ndidn't like that. And here are areas where you can't seem to agree.\"\nMeanwhile, we were putting together prototypes to show people.\n\nI was clear up front that there were some ground rules. For example, we were\nnot going to get rid of performance discussions, and we wanted pay-for-\nperformance. But in general, it was wide open. The whole process took less\ntime than most companies take to redesign their performance management\nprograms, and we involved about 100,000 employees. Finally, we asked, \"What do\nyou want to call it?\" Tens of thousands of people voted. We had three names in\nthe end, and Checkpoint was selected.\n\nPerformance management can never be perfect. But your baby is never ugly. Our\nemployees created their own program, and there is pride in that. You can see\nit in their ongoing blogs, where we ask them to talk about what's working and\nwhat's not and to tell us how we can improve the system. We've been doing that\never since we put it out there. Their overall message has been \"This is what\nwe wanted.\" It was cited as the top reason engagement improved. People are\ngetting much more feedback out of this system, in much richer ways. And more\nimportant, they are not feeling like spectators in our transformation; they\nare active participants.\n\n\"We've been able to swiftly detect problems and commit to doing something\nabout them.\"\n\nHow are you using \"sentiment analysis\" to further address employees' needs?\n\nSentiment analysis is very helpful in a world where people are always\ncommenting online. Our cognitive technology looks at the words people choose\nand picks up the tone. It identifies whether it's positive or negative and\nthen goes deeper, saying whether it's strongly positive or strongly negative.\nIn that way it's almost like looking at music--seeing where there are very\nhigh notes or very low notes that are loud. It's always behind our firewall,\nnever external. It's not looking at any of the information people pass around\nor at their e-mail content or browsing behavior. It's just looking at tone in\ntheir blogs and comments inside the firewall.\n\nWith this approach you can pick up pretty quickly if there's an area you need\nto dive into. We've been able to swiftly detect problems that are starting to\nbrew and, more important, make a commitment to do something about them. This\nis the most exciting part of having a social platform to work with. We've had\nseveral examples of things we did wrong. Some of my folks decided we wouldn't\nreimburse for ridesharing. Employees became agitated, and I could quickly\nrespond to a concern that had turned into a petition. \"I read all your\ncomments,\" I told them, \"and you made some great points we hadn't thought of.\nWe were trying to look out for your security, but on balance, this wasn't the\nright choice. Let's return to our original policy.\" All this happened within\n24 hours. People felt listened to and were very appreciative.\n\nWe had a similar situation about a year ago. We had to impute income when you\nwere traveling to a client site for a full week and, instead of returning home\nright away, you had your spouse or a friend join you for the weekend. Because\nwe would reimburse the guest's travel, it created a tax issue. We altered the\nprogram because that was getting messy, and again employees were incensed. I\ncan certainly understand why. If you're on the road all the time, of course\nyou might want your spouse to join you for a weekend. People didn't want us\nmaking the decision for them. That was another case where we quickly got\ntogether and said, \"Hey, if they want to be responsible for their own taxes,\nthey can do it.\" It was a good wake-up call for us to not be so paternalistic.\n\nIn organizations where people aren't physically all together, you can use\nsentiment analysis to get a sense of where you've got trouble spots, where\nyour management isn't strong enough, where groups of people are expressing\nnegative opinions. It allows you to check in on those sites or groups and find\nout what's going on.\n\nDo employees have more power now than in the past?\n\nYes. So much more weight is now given to what is said inside an organization,\nbecause it can be heard outside as well, through social media. Glassdoor is a\nperfect example. In the past you might have had companies that weren't great\nto work for, but only a small circle of people knew about it. Now the whole\nworld knows about it, because it's on Glassdoor--and that's turned companies\ninto glass houses. People can look in and see what's going on and make\njudgments about whether they want to work there in a way that they weren't\nable to before.\n\nLet's go back to the business reasons behind IBM's shift to agile talent\npractices--can you say more about those?\n\nI mentioned client satisfaction. Clients today are looking for speed and\nresponsiveness like never before. In an earlier era what they really wanted\nwas the best product at the best price--efficiency was important, but speed\nwas less so.\n\nIn the early 2000s we would have staffed a project with experts from all over\nthe world, and they would have spent a fraction of their time on that project,\nbecause they were also working on other projects. They would have joined\nconference calls, which is always hard because people are in different time\nzones. And I'm sure they were multitasking while they were on those calls.\nThat project might have taken six months to a year. Now we would take a\nsmaller group of dedicated people and put them together for three months, and\nthey would get it all done using agile methodology. It's a different way of\nthinking about how to create value for clients. It responds to their need for\nspeed.\n\nIs there some hope that an agile approach to talent will help IBM make up\nground in revenue and growth that it lost in its transition to cloud computing\nand other businesses?\n\nWe're a company that's transforming itself: 45% of our revenue comes from\nbusinesses we were not in five years ago, and we are an $80 billion company.\nWhen you're going through that kind of shift and seeing a downturn in some of\nyour legacy businesses, and you're renovating those while you're launching new\nbusinesses, you may see some unevenness in performance. You're basically\nchanging the tires while you're driving the car. And yes, that takes agility.\n\n* * *\n\n[Lisa Burrell](/search?term=lisa+burrell) is a senior editor at _Harvard\nBusiness Review_.\n\n* * *\n\n## One Bank\u2019s Agile Team Experiment\n\n  * [Dominic Barton](/search?term=dominic%20barton)\n  * [Dennis Carey](/search?term=dennis%20carey)\n  * [Ram Charan](/search?term=ram%20charan)\n\n  * __Save\n  * __Share\n\n![COLORMOS/GETTY\nIMAGES](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_BARTON.jpg)\n\nCOLORMOS/GETTY IMAGES\n\nWhen web and mobile technologies disrupted the banking industry, consumers\nbecame more and more aware of what they could do for themselves. They quickly\nembraced what Ralph Hamers, CEO of the global banking group ING, calls\n\"banking on the go.\"\n\nBy 2014 about 40% of all interactions with ING retail customers were coming in\nthrough mobile apps. (Now the figure is closer to 60%--and branch visits and\ncalls to contact centers have dropped below 1%.) Even then mobile customers\nexpected easy access to up-to-date information whenever and wherever they\nlogged in. For instance, someone who started a loan transaction during the\ntrain ride home from work wanted to be able to continue it on a desktop that\nnight. \"Our customers were spending most of their online time on platforms\nlike Facebook and Netflix,\" says Hamers. \"Those set the standard for user\nexperience.\"\n\nThat meant ING needed to become nimbler and more user-focused to serve its 30\nmillion-plus customers across the world at every point in their financial\njourneys. So Hamers worked with Nick Jue, then the CEO of ING's Netherlands\ngroup, to launch a pilot transformation in the headquarters of ING's largest\nunit, its Dutch retail operations. The first step was to help other senior\nleaders and the board envision a new agile, team-based system for deploying,\ndeveloping, and assessing talent. (ING had already adopted agile and scrum\nmethodologies in its Dutch IT unit, but those ways of working were new to\nother parts of the organization.) Hamers and his leadership team then met with\npeople at tech companies they admired, learning how their talent systems\nenabled better customer service. By the spring of 2015 the headquarters of ING\nNetherlands, home to some 3,500 full-time employees, had replaced most of its\ntraditional structure with a fluid, agile organization composed of _tribes,\nsquads,_ and _chapters._\n\n#### Tribes, Squads, and Chapters\n\nING's new agile system for deploying talent and managing performance organizes\npeople by domain, customer need, and function. After experimenting with this\nstructure in its Dutch retail unit, the company decided to roll it out more\nbroadly.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/R1802B_SPOT_TRIBES.png)\n\nThirteen tribes were created to address specific domains, such as mortgage\nservices, securities, and private banking. Each tribe contains up to 150\npeople. (Employees in sales, service, and support functions work outside this\nstructure--in smaller customer-loyalty teams, for instance--but they\ncollaborate with the tribes.) And each has a lead who establishes priorities,\nallocates budgets, and ensures that knowledge and insights are shared both\nwithin and across tribes.\n\nThe tribe lead has one other critical responsibility: to create, with input\nfrom tribe members, self-steering squads of nine or fewer people to address\nspecific customer needs by delivering and maintaining new products and\nservices. These squads are cross-disciplinary--typically, a mix of marketing\nspecialists, data analysts, user-experience designers, IT engineers, and\nproduct specialists. One squad member is designated the \"product owner,\"\nresponsible for coordinating activities and setting priorities. The squad\nstays together as long as is required to meet the customer need from start to\nfinish--whether it is, for example, improving user experience on the mobile\napp or building a particular feature. Some tasks are completed in two weeks;\nothers might take 18 months. Sometimes the squads disband and the members join\nother ones. Most often, however, squads that are working well stay together\nand move on to address other customer needs.\n\nBy working in such small units and with colleagues from various disciplines,\nsquad members can quickly resolve issues that might previously have bounced\nfrom department to department. Information sharing is encouraged through\nmechanisms such as scrums and daily stand-ups--the kinds of gatherings you'd\nfind at a tech start-up. Seeing a project through from start to finish gives\neach squad a sense of ownership and connection to the customer.\n\nImplementing an agile talent system doesn't mean embracing chaos. In fact, a\nsystem that's well designed observes clearly defined rules and safeguards to\nensure institutional stability. Every tribe, for example, has a couple of\nagile coaches to help squads and individuals collaborate effectively in an\nenvironment where employees are encouraged to solve problems on the ground\nrather than pass them on to someone else. Although you might think adapting\nwould be most difficult for long-term bank employees, that's not so, according\nto ING Netherlands CIO Peter Jacobs. Many of them \"adapted even more quickly\nand more readily than the younger generation,\" he says, perhaps because their\nexpertise now has more impact than in the past, when so many sign-offs were\nrequired.\n\nWorking in small, cross-functional units, squads can resolve issues quickly.\n\nThen there are the chapters, which coordinate members of the same discipline--\ndata analytics, say, or systems processes--who are scattered among squads.\nChapter leads are responsible for tracking and sharing best practices and for\nsuch things as professional development and performance reviews. Think of\nchapters as a way of retaining the helpful parts of traditional management\neven while dispensing with time-consuming handoffs and bureaucracy.\n\nRegular assessments are built into the system. Every two weeks squads review\ntheir work. Says Hamers, \"They get to decide how they will continue to improve\nthe product for our customers, or if they want to 'fail fast.'\" (Learning from\nfailure is applauded.) Squads also do a thorough self-assessment after\ncompleting any engagement, and tribes perform quarterly business reviews\n(QBRs), looking at their biggest successes and failures, reviewing their most\nimportant learnings, and articulating goals for the next three months.\n\nThese safeguards help counter what Vincent van den Boogert, the current CEO of\nING Netherlands (and part of the team that launched the new organizational\nstructure), sees as the two biggest challenges of a squad-based system. One is\nthe possibility that self-empowered squads responding primarily to the needs\nof customers might embark on changes that aren't in sync with company\nstrategy. The QBRs mitigate that risk. The second challenge is somewhat\ncounterintuitive. Self-evaluating squads are sometimes content with the\nincremental improvements they make every two weeks. The QBRs help in that\nregard, too, because top management uses them to formulate and reinforce\nstretch goals.\n\nMore than two years in, Hamers considers the talent experiment a big success.\nCustomer satisfaction and employee engagement are both up, and ING is quicker\nto market with new products. So the bank has started to roll out this new way\nof working to the roughly 40,000 employees outside its home country. For\nHamers, the change can't come soon enough. The apps for each of ING's 13\nretail markets vary in appearance, design, and function. Hamers wants to make\nthings much simpler so that any customer, anywhere, will encounter the same\nING. \"Tech companies have one platform across the globe,\" he says. \"No matter\nwhere you use Netflix, Facebook, or Google, you get the same service. ING must\ndo the same. That is the only way we will bring all our customers along into\nthe future of banking.\"\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/110-dominic-barton.jpg)\n\n[Dominic Barton](/search?term=dominic+barton) is the global managing partner\nof McKinsey & Company.

Rasmus](/Authors/daniel-w.-rasmus \"Posts by Daniel W. Rasmus\")\n|  August 22, 2019\n\neWEEK RESOURCE PAGE: Enterprises are beginning to take a closer look at\nMicrosoft\u2019s relatively new Teams collaboration toolset.\n\n**Download the authoritative guide:[Big Data: Mining Data for\nRevenue](https://o1.qnsr.com/cgi/r?WT.qs_dlk=Xo14@QrIhEMAABzuH8sAAAAv;;n=203;c=1668429;s=14821;x=7936;f=201911080913470;u=j;z=TIMESTAMP;k=https%3A%2F%2Fassetform.eweek.com%2Fcontroller%3Fasset%3D253713510%26srvid%3D95900%26vkey%3D4190310%26io%3D11111%26qid%3D000%26qset%3DCONTACTFORM_HQB%26formHQB%3Dy%26domain%3Dwww.eweek.com)**\n\n![Microsoft.Teams](/imagesvr_ez/b2bezp/2019/08/Microsoft.Teams.jpg?alias=article_hero)\n\nA Microsoft Teams structure allows organizations to create containers for\nwork. Those work containers can be as arbitrary as an organization allows.\n\nControlling the architecture of a Teams implementation falls to policy and\npractice rather than technology. Ahead of a Teams implementation,\norganizations should plan in parallel for how people will use Teams (see \"Ten\nTips for Effective Microsoft Teams Deployment\" on the SeriousInsights.net\nsite), along with an architecture for their Teams and channels structure.\n\nTeams acts as containers for work, and within those containers, work breaks\ndown into channels.\n\n**_Go here to view eWEEK's compilation of_** _[ **Top Project Management and\nCollaboration Tool Companies**](https://www.eweek.com/enterprise-apps/eweek-s-\ntop-vendors-project-management-collaboration-tools) **.**_\n\n#### Further reading\n\n  * [ Zoho Offers Small Businesses Emergency Subscription... ](/enterprise-apps/zoho-offers-small-businesses-emergency-subscription-assistance)\n  * [ Zoho Offering Free Use of Its Remotely Productivity... ](/enterprise-apps/zoho-offering-free-use-of-its-remotely-productivity-app)\n\nFor those familiar with Slack, channels will not require much of a conceptual\nleap. For those who use SharePoint, however, the idea of channels may be new,\nand channels may not prove intuitive. Think of channels as sub-levels of a\nTeam, each with their own file structure and focused conversations. All Team\nmembers can access all channels.\n\nAll teams start with a \u201cGeneral channel.\u201d  This channel should serve the\npurpose of:\n\n  * Managing the Team and understanding the evolution of its charter.\n  * Information and tutorials about the Team for new members.\n  * General Team announcements.\n\nIn teams with many channels, favoriting a channel makes it easier for members\nto navigate to the channels they find more useful (or required).\n\nAs pointed out in \"Management by Design,\" Serious Insights sees policies as\ncodified practice and practice as non-codified (or not yet codified) policy.\nTeams implementations typically include both:\n\n**Policy:** a general architecture for the creation of Teams along with\nguidelines for use\n\n**Practice:** covering the adaptive use of Teams in an attempt to balance\nbetween unruly and inflexible.\n\nEach organization needs to choose the structure of Teams sites. As with all\ntechnology governed by policies and practices, the choices should not only be\ncommunicated widely, but regularly tested for conformance and collaborated\ntoward compliance.\n\nFor the typical organization, consider the following hierarchy as a good\nstarting point for the policy-based architecture.\n\n#### **A Prototypical Teams Structure**\n\n **Employee Engagement:  **A general employee engagement Team focuses on key\nelements that might be served by an enterprise employee portal. For those who\nhave an employee portal, or who adopted another tool like Facebook for Work,\nthis Team would be redundant. For those just getting started, or who are\nlooking to Teams as an overall replacement for other environments, this Team\nwill prove a cornerstone. If this Team works, the other Teams will more likely\nwork as well.\n\nThere is one Team titled \u201cEmployee Engagement.\u201d The four elements listed under\nEmployee Engagement represent channels, not separate teams. Each reflects an\naspect of employee engagement without being a big enough topic for a dedicated\nteam. If the team is more of a repository than an active collaborative space,\nit should be a channel rather than a team.\n\nTeams presents an issue for large organizations. Team implementation limits\nmembership to 2,500, relegating the Employee Engagement team to medium and\nsmaller-sized organizations.\n\nThe diagram also illustrates how departments, communities, projects, products\nand processes might look. Again, the top-level item is a Team, while the items\nbelow are channels.\n\nEach top-level team will have its own charter and membership. Here are some\nexamples:\n\n  * **Department Teams:** Intended to focus on managing the team and the function. These teams cover team building, skills and competencies, roles and responsibilities. Membership is open because the various teams should learn from each other and not duplicate work. Onboarding, for instance, would be better served by providing a link to a departmental document within a team rather than as an email, a link or a file that duplicates content. Work that requires confidentiality or secrecy calls for a separate team with controlled membership. All teams, however, should have a public-facing site as well, and that should ideally be consolidated in a master Team so charters, team members, shared work and other items can easily be discovered.\n  * **Communities:** Offer places for communities to self-manage, as well as evolve their internal advisories in the case of communities of practice. Communities of practice might include design engineers managing engineering practices for the organization. This Team would be limited to design engineers. Communities of purpose, interest and passion should be open and self-selecting (public and discoverable). Communities of circumstance would be focused on specific topics and would likely warrant their own Team due to their unique membership. Home-based workers would be a good example of a community of circumstance.\n  * **Projects:** Any activity that requires a virtual, cross-functional team. Some organizations may want to break projects into larger chunks before creating channels. Customer-facing project versus internal projects would be one example. Firms organized around projects may find that organizing their Teams around customers with channels for managing projects would make more sense.\n  * **Products:** As with projects, individual product collaboration takes place in channels. Larger organizations, however, may find that they need more depth and detail, and the ability to manage membership by product line. In those cases, products or suites of products may segregate work within separate Teams.\n  * **Processes:** Focuses on larger internal processes like customer support, sales or innovation. In the case of sales, the community of practice for sales may look like an overlap with the sales process. The sales community of practice should focus, however, on how to be a good salesperson, whereas the Sales Process channel should focus on how to make the internal sales process efficient and how to effectively use sale support tools. _Process_ as a parent for all processes makes the most sense in organizations with a cross-functional process team. Cross-functional processes inside of large organizations probably need their own Team or, at a minimum, a Team to group related process channels. A good example would be product engineering in aerospace or automotive that spans the entire organization. This Team might also include auxiliary processes covering component engineering and systems, such as transmissions or antennas as components, and electrical or drivetrains as systems.\n\nIT support offers an interesting conundrum to a logical structure because its\ncharacter reflects multiple facets of the hierarchy. IT support sits arguably\nas a process, but because of its broad need, it could be seen as part of\nEmployee Engagement. We suggest making IT Support its own Team for the\nfollowing reasons:\n\n  * The Team has a unique charter.\n  * The Team will likely be seen as a destination by its users.\n  * The Team is open and discoverable by design.\n  * As a location intended for frequent visitation, placing the Team at the top of the hierarchy makes it easier to find.\n  * IT Support is likely to grow to sufficient size and internal complexity that making it a channel would overly constrain future design options.\n\nTeams requires organizations to conduct a categorization process and to\nmaintain discipline within those categories.\n\nIT Support employees (and contractors) might also benefit from a community of\npractice for their discipline.\n\n#### **Making Choices With Teams**\n\nTeams requires organizations to conduct a categorization process and to\nmaintain discipline within those categories. Most organizations will see\ntransgression from policy and practice, at least occasionally. This is, of\ncourse, no different from exercises around categorizing content. Not only does\neach organization evolve a unique view of its information relationships, but\neach person does as well.\n\nMost people are challenged to explain why their paper files, operating system\nfolders and email folders don\u2019t align. Organization takes place in the moment\nand rarely gets revisited unless it falls within a mission-critical area where\npeople are responsible and accountable for maintaining discipline. Beyond\nthat, it\u2019s all up to the individual, his or her attention span, and his or her\nbandwidth within other priorities.\n\nThe prototypical nature of these recommendations needs to remain flexible so\nthe Teams structure remains responsive to change. An overly structured site\nmay lead to abandonment because people don\u2019t feel like the structure meets\ntheir needs. An unruly structure results in the inability to find information\nor people. Organizations need to adopt transparent policies that bend without\nbreaking. Most importantly, they need to actively advocate for a shared\nrepository lest the organization\u2019s memory be scattered among too many silos.\n\n#### **Three Questions to Ask Before Creating a New Team**\n\nThese three questions will help guide the choice of creating a new Team or\nperhaps just adding a channel to an existing Team.\n\n  1. Does the new Team have a unique charter and/or membership?\n  2. Is there a collaboration space on another platform like Facebook for Work or Slack that already serves the charter/members associated with this Team?\n  3. Will the Team act as a broader parent for subtopics?\n\nIf any of these questions results in a \u201cno\u201d then the Team should not be\ncreated (or carefully considered before it is). For each of the questions,\nlook to a remedy that eliminates duplication, eases collaboration, manages\ntoward fewer Teams and makes the content discoverable.\n\n#### **Challenges to Microsoft Teams From Other Tools**\n\nIn Microsoft-leaning organizations, Microsoft\u2019s own products are the biggest\ncompetitors to consistent use of Teams for collaboration. Sharing files from\nOneDrive via Exchange (or other mail platforms) offers peer-to-peer\ncollaboration, without the overhead of thinking about a hierarchy of\ncollaborative spaces. The problem, as always with peer-to-peer collaboration\nlike email, is the inherent lack of transparency of conversations initiated\nbetween two or a few people. Then there is Yammer, which offers more global\nconversations\u2014conversations that might end up capturing information that would\nbe better stored in Teams.\n\nOther tools, from Slack to Salesforce, from Jira and Trello to Facebook for\nWork, challenge Teams as _the_ source of information, fragmenting attention,\noften wasting time and usually burning budget due to duplication of function\nwithin the infrastructure.\n\n#### **What Does Microsoft Need to Do to Make It Easier to Migrate and Combine\nTeams?**\n\nWhile files can move between Teams, conversations and other elements cannot.\nIt would be good for Microsoft to develop a Teams migration tool that\nsupported the movement of not just content, but structures and conversations\nbetween Teams, for consolidation as well as disaggregation.\n\n**_Daniel W.

It's now guiding\ndecisions on everything from crop harvests to bank loans, and uses like\ntotally automated customer service are on the horizon. Indeed, McKinsey\nestimates that AI will add $13 trillion to the global economy in the next\ndecade. Yet companies are struggling to scale up their AI efforts. Most have\nrun only ad hoc projects or applied AI in just a single business process.\n\nIn surveys of thousands of executives and work with hundreds of clients,\nMcKinsey has identified how firms can capture the full AI opportunity. The key\nis to understand the organizational and cultural barriers AI initiatives face\nand work to lower them. That means shifting workers away from traditional\nmindsets, like relying on top-down decision making, which often run counter to\nthose needed for AI. Leaders can also set up AI projects for success by\nconveying their urgency and benefits; investing heavily in AI education and\nadoption; and accounting for the company's AI maturity, business complexity,\nand innovation pace when deciding how work should be organized.\n\n#### Idea in Brief\n\n##### The Problem\n\nMany companies\u2019 efforts to scale up artificial intelligence fall short. That\u2019s\nbecause only 8% of firms are engaging in core practices that support\nwidespread adoption.\n\n##### The Solution\n\nCutting-edge technology and talent are not enough. Companies must break down\norganizational and cultural barriers that stand in AI\u2019s way.\n\n##### The Leadership Imperatives\n\nLeaders must convey the urgency of AI initiatives and their benefits for all;\nspend at least as much on adoption as on technology; organize AI work on the\nbasis of the company\u2019s AI maturity, business complexity, and innovation pace;\nand invest in AI education for everyone.\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2019/07/building-the-ai-powered-organization?language=es)\n\nArtificial intelligence is reshaping business\u2014though not at the blistering\npace many assume. True, AI is now guiding decisions on everything from crop\nharvests to bank loans, and once pie-in-the-sky prospects such as totally\nautomated customer service are on the horizon. The technologies that enable\nAI, like development platforms and vast processing power and data storage, are\nadvancing rapidly and becoming increasingly affordable. The time seems ripe\nfor companies to capitalize on AI. Indeed, we estimate that AI will add $13\ntrillion to the global economy over the next decade.\n\nYet, despite the promise of AI, many organizations\u2019 efforts with it are\nfalling short. We\u2019ve surveyed thousands of executives about how their\ncompanies use and organize for AI and advanced analytics, and our [data\nshows](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-\ninsights/breaking-away-the-secrets-to-scaling-analytics) that only 8% of firms\nengage in core practices that support widespread adoption. Most firms have run\nonly [ad hoc pilots](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-\nintelligence/ai-adoption-advances-but-foundational-barriers-remain) or are\napplying AI in just a single business process.\n\nWhy the slow prog\u00adress? At the highest level, it\u2019s a reflection of a failure\nto rewire the organization. In our surveys and our work with hundreds of\nclients, we\u2019ve seen that AI initiatives face formidable cultural and\norganizational barriers. But we\u2019ve also seen that leaders who at the outset\ntake steps to break down those barriers can effectively capture AI\u2019s\nopportunities.\n\n## Making the Shift\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes leaders make is to view AI as a plug-and-play\ntechnology with immediate returns. Deciding to get a few projects up and\nrunning, they begin investing millions in data infrastructure, AI software\ntools, data expertise, and model development. Some of the pilots manage to eke\nout small gains in pockets of organizations. But then months or years pass\nwithout bringing the big wins executives expected. Firms struggle to move from\nthe pilots to companywide programs\u2014and from a focus on discrete business\nproblems, such as improved customer segmentation, to big business challenges,\nlike optimizing the entire customer journey.\n\nLeaders also often think too narrowly about AI requirements. While cutting-\nedge technology and talent are certainly needed, it\u2019s equally important to\nalign a company\u2019s culture, structure, and ways of working to support broad AI\nadoption. But at most businesses that aren\u2019t born digital, traditional\nmindsets and ways of working run counter to those needed for AI.\n\nTo scale up AI, companies must make three shifts:\n\n### From siloed work to interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\nAI has the biggest impact when it\u2019s developed by cross-functional teams with a\nmix of skills and perspectives. Having business and operational people work\nside by side with analytics experts will ensure that initiatives address broad\norganizational priorities, not just isolated business issues. Diverse teams\ncan also think through the operational changes new applications may\nrequire\u2014they\u2019re likelier to recognize, say, that the introduction of an\nalgorithm that predicts maintenance needs should be accompanied by an overhaul\nof maintenance workflows. And when development teams involve end users in the\ndesign of applications, the chances of adoption increase dramatically.\n\n### From experience-based, leader-driven decision making to data-driven\ndecision making at the front line.\n\nWhen AI is adopted broadly, employees up and down the hierarchy will augment\ntheir own judgment and intuition with algorithms\u2019 recommendations to arrive at\nbetter answers than either humans or machines could reach on their own. But\nfor this approach to work, people at all levels have to trust the algorithms\u2019\nsuggestions and feel empowered to make decisions\u2014and that means abandoning the\ntraditional top-down approach. If employees have to consult a higher-up before\ntaking action, that will inhibit the use of AI.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/06/R1904C_ULIAN_A.jpg)  \nLeonardo Ulian\n\nDecision processes shifted dramatically at one organization when it replaced a\ncomplex manual method for scheduling events with a new AI system.\nHistorically, the firm\u2019s event planners had used colored tags, pins, and\nstickers to track conflicts, participants\u2019 preferences, and other\nconsiderations. They\u2019d often relied on gut instinct and on input from senior\nmanagers, who also were operating on their instincts, to make decisions. The\nnew system rapidly analyzed the vast range of scheduling permutations, using\nfirst one algorithm to distill hundreds of millions of options into millions\nof scenarios, and then another algorithm to boil down those millions into just\nhundreds, ranking the optimal schedules for each participant. Experienced\nhuman planners then applied their expertise to make final decisions supported\nby the data, without the need to get input from their leaders. The planners\nadopted the tool readily, trusting its output because they\u2019d helped set its\nparameters and constraints and knew that they themselves would make the final\ncall.\n\n### From rigid and risk-averse to agile, experimental, and adaptable.\n\nOrganizations must shed the mindset that an idea needs to be fully baked or a\nbusiness tool must have every bell and whistle before it\u2019s deployed. On the\nfirst iteration, AI applications rarely have all their desired functionality.\nA test-and-learn mentality will reframe mistakes as a source of discoveries,\nreducing the fear of failure. Getting early user feedback and incorporating it\ninto the next version will allow firms to correct minor issues before they\nbecome costly problems. Development will speed up, enabling small AI teams to\ncreate minimum viable products in a matter of weeks rather than months.\n\nSuch fundamental shifts don\u2019t come easily. They require leaders to prepare,\nmotivate, and equip the workforce to make a change. But leaders must first be\nprepared themselves. We\u2019ve seen failure after failure caused by the lack of a\nfoundational understanding of AI [among senior\nexecutives.](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-\nanalytics/our-insights/an-executives-guide-to-ai) (Further on, we\u2019ll discuss\nhow analytics academies can help leaders acquire that understanding.)\n\n## Setting Up for Success\n\nTo get employees on board and smooth the way for successful AI launches,\nleaders should devote early attention to several tasks:\n\n### Explaining why.\n\nA compelling story helps organizations understand the urgency of change\ninitiatives and how all will benefit from them. This is particularly critical\nwith AI projects, because fear that AI will take away jobs increases\nemployees\u2019 resistance to it.\n\nLeaders have to provide a vision that rallies everyone around a common goal.\nWorkers must understand why AI is important to the business and how they\u2019ll\nfit into a new, AI-oriented culture. In particular, they need reassurance that\nAI will enhance rather than diminish or even eliminate their roles. ([Our\nresearch](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Future%20of%20Organizations/What%20the%20future%20of%20work%20will%20mean%20for%20jobs%20skills%20and%20wages/MGI%20Jobs%20Lost-\nJobs%20Gained_In%20Brief_December%202017.ashx) shows that the majority of\nworkers will need to adapt to using AI rather than be replaced by AI.)\n\nAt most firms that aren\u2019t born digital, mindsets run counter to those needed\nfor AI.\n\nWhen a large retail conglomerate wanted to get its employees behind its AI\nstrategy, management presented it as an existential imperative. Leaders\ndescribed the threat that digital retailers posed and how AI could help fend\nit off by improving the firm\u2019s operational efficiency and responsiveness. By\nissuing a call to arms in a fight for survival, management underscored the\ncritical role that employees had to play.\n\nIn sharing their vision, the company\u2019s leaders put a spotlight on workers who\nhad piloted a new AI tool that helped them optimize stores\u2019 product\nassortments and increase revenue. That inspired other workers to imagine how\nAI could augment and elevate their performance.\n\n### Anticipating unique barriers to change.\n\nSome obstacles, such as workers\u2019 fear of becoming obsolete, are common across\norganizations. But a company\u2019s culture may also have distinctive\ncharacteristics that contribute to resistance. For example, if a company has\nrelationship managers who pride themselves on being attuned to customer needs,\nthey may reject the notion that a machine could have better ideas about what\ncustomers want and ignore an AI tool\u2019s tailored product recommendations. And\nmanagers in large organizations who believe their status is based on the\nnumber of people they oversee might object to the decentralized decision\nmaking or reduction in reports that AI could allow.\n\nIn other cases, siloed processes can inhibit the broad adoption of AI.\nOrganizations that assign budgets by function or business unit may struggle to\nassemble interdisciplinary agile teams, for example.\n\nSome solutions can be found by reviewing how past change initiatives overcame\nbarriers. Others may involve aligning AI initiatives with the very cultural\nvalues that seem like obstacles. At one financial institution with a strong\nemphasis on relationship banking, for example, leaders highlighted AI\u2019s\nability to enhance ties with customers. The bank created a booklet for\nrelationship managers that showed how combining their expertise and skills\nwith AI\u2019s tailored product recommendations could improve customers\u2019\nexperiences and increase revenue and profit. The AI adoption program also\nincluded a contest for sales conversions driven by using the new tool; the\nwinners\u2019 achievements were showcased in the CEO\u2019s monthly newsletter to\nemployees.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/06/R1904C_ULIAN_B.jpg)  \nLeonardo Ulian\n\nA relatively new class of expert, [analytics translators,](/2018/02/you-dont-\nhave-to-be-a-data-scientist-to-fill-this-must-have-analytics-role) can play a\nrole in identifying roadblocks. These people bridge the data engineers and\nscientists from the technical realm with the people from the business\nrealm\u2014marketing, supply chain, manufacturing, risk personnel, and so on.\nTranslators help ensure that the AI applications developed address business\nneeds and that adoption goes smoothly. Early in the implementation process,\nthey may survey end users, observe their habits, and study workflows to\ndiagnose and fix problems.\n\nUnderstanding the barriers to change can not only inform leaders about how to\ncommunicate with the workforce but also help them determine where to invest,\nwhat AI initiatives are most feasible, what training should be offered, what\nincentives may be necessary, and more.\n\n### Budgeting as much for integration and adoption as for technology (if not\nmore).\n\nIn one of our surveys nearly 90% of the companies that had engaged in\nsuccessful scaling practices had spent more than half of their analytics\nbudgets on activities that drove adoption, such as workflow redesign,\ncommunication, and training. Only 23% of the remaining companies had committed\nsimilar resources.\n\nRelationship managers may reject the notion that a machine knows what\ncustomers want.\n\nConsider one telecom provider that was launching a new AI-driven customer-\nretention program in its call center. The company invested simultaneously in\nAI model development and in helping the center\u2019s employees transition to the\nnew approach. Instead of just reacting to calls canceling service, they would\nproactively reach out to customers at risk of defection, giving them AI-\ngenerated recommendations on new offers they\u2019d be likely to accept. The\nemployees got training and on-the-job coaching in the sales skills needed to\nclose the business. Coaches and managers listened in on their calls, gave them\nindividualized feedback, and continually updated the training materials and\ncall scripts. Thanks to those coordinated efforts, the new program reduced\ncustomer attrition by 10%.\n\n### Balancing feasibility, time investment, and value.\n\nPursuing initiatives that are unduly difficult to implement or require more\nthan a year to launch can sabotage both current and future AI projects.\n\nOrganizations needn\u2019t focus solely on quick wins; they should develop a\nportfolio of initiatives with different time horizons. Automated processes\nthat don\u2019t need human intervention, such as AI-assisted fraud detection, can\ndeliver a return in months, while projects that require human involvement,\nsuch as AI-supported customer service, are likely to pay off over a longer\nperiod. Prioritization should be based on a long-term (typically three-year)\nview and take into consideration how several initiatives with different time\nlines could be combined to maximize value. For example, to achieve a view of\ncustomers detailed enough to allow AI to do microsegmentation, a company might\nneed to set up a number of sales and marketing initiatives. Some, such as\ntargeted offers, might deliver value in a few months, while it might take 12\nto 18 months for the entire suite of capabilities to achieve full impact.\n\nAn Asian Pacific retailer determined that an AI initiative to optimize floor\nspace and inventory placement wouldn\u2019t yield its complete value unless the\ncompany refurbished all its stores, reallocating the space for each category\nof goods. After much debate, the firm\u2019s executives decided the proj\u00adect was\nimportant enough to future profitability to proceed\u2014but not without splitting\nit in two. Part one produced an AI tool that gave store managers\nrecommendations for a few incremental items that would sell well in their\noutlets. The tool provided only a small fraction of the total return\nanticipated, but the managers could get the new items into stores immediately,\ndemonstrating the project\u2019s benefits and building enthusiasm for the multiyear\njourney ahead.\n\n## Organizing for Scale\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of debate about where AI and analytics capabilities should\nreside within organizations. Often leaders simply ask, \u201cWhat organizational\nmodel works best?\u201d and then, after hearing what succeeded at other companies,\ndo one of three things: consolidate the majority of AI and analytics\ncapabilities within a central \u201chub\u201d; decentralize them and embed them mostly\nin the business units (\u201cthe spokes\u201d); or distribute them across both, using a\nhybrid (\u201chub-and-spoke\u201d) model. We\u2019ve found that none of these models is\nalways better than the others at getting AI up to scale; the right choice\ndepends on a firm\u2019s individual situation.\n\nCompanies with good scaling practices spent half their analytics budgets on\nadoption.\n\nConsider two large financial institutions we\u2019ve worked with. One consolidated\nits AI and analytics teams in a central hub, with all analytics staff\nreporting to the chief data and analytics officer and being deployed to\nbusiness units as needed. The second decentralized nearly all its analytics\ntalent, having teams reside in and report to the business units. Both firms\ndeveloped AI on a scale at the top of their industry; the second organization\ngrew from 30 to 200 profitable AI initiatives in just two years. And both\nselected their model after taking into account their organizations\u2019 structure,\ncapabilities, strategy, and unique characteristics.\n\n### The hub.\n\nA small handful of responsibilities are always best handled by a hub and led\nby the chief analytics or chief data officer. These include data governance,\nAI recruiting and training strategy, and work with third-party providers of\ndata and AI services and software. Hubs should nurture AI talent, create\ncommunities where AI experts can share best practices, and lay out processes\nfor AI development across the organization. Our research shows that companies\nthat have implemented AI on a large scale are three times as likely as their\npeers to have a hub and 2.5 times as likely to have a clear methodology for\ncreating models, interpreting insights, and deploying new AI capabilities.\n\nHubs should also be responsible for systems and standards related to AI. These\nshould be driven by the needs of a firm\u2019s initiatives, which means they should\nbe developed gradually, rather than set up in one fell swoop, before business\ncases have been determined. We\u2019ve seen many organizations squander significant\ntime and money\u2014spending hundreds of millions of dollars\u2014up front on\ncompanywide data-cleaning and data-integration projects, only to abort those\nefforts midway, realizing little or no benefits.\n\nIn contrast, when a European bank found that conflicting data-management\nstrategies were hindering its development of new AI tools, it took a slower\napproach, making a plan to unify its data architecture and management over the\nnext four years as it built various business cases for its AI transformation.\nThis multiphase program, which also includes an organizational redesign and a\nrevised talent strategy, is expected to have an annual impact of more than\n$900 million.\n\n### The spokes.\n\nAnother handful of responsibilities should almost always be owned by the\nspokes, because they\u2019re closest to those who will be using the AI systems.\nAmong them are tasks related to adoption, including end-user training,\nworkflow redesign, incentive programs, performance management, and impact\ntracking.\n\nTo encourage customers to embrace the AI-enabled services offered with its\nsmart, connected equipment, one manufacturer\u2019s sales and service organization\ncreated a \u201cSWAT team\u201d that supported customers using the product and developed\na pricing plan to boost adoption. Such work is clearly the bailiwick of a\nspoke and can\u2019t be delegated to an analytics hub.\n\n## Organizing AI for Scale\n\nAI-enabled companies divide key roles between a hub and spokes. A few tasks\nare always owned by the hub, and the spokes always own execution. The rest of\nthe work falls into a gray area, and a firm\u2019s individual characteristics\ndetermine where it should be\ndone.![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/06/R1904C_FOUNTAINE_ORGANIZINGAI_desktop.png)\n\n## Organizing AI for Scale\n\nAI-enabled companies divide key roles between a hub and spokes. A few tasks\nare always owned by the hub, and the spokes always own execution. The rest of\nthe work falls into a gray area, and a firm\u2019s individual characteristics\ndetermine where it should be\ndone.![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/06/R1904C_FOUNTAINE_ORGANIZINGAI_mobile.png)\n\n### The gray area.\n\nMuch of the work in successful AI transformations falls into a gray area in\nterms of responsibility. Key tasks\u2014setting the direction for AI projects,\nanalyzing the problems they\u2019ll solve, building the algorithms, designing the\ntools, testing them with end users, managing the change, and creating the\nsupporting IT infrastructure\u2014can be owned by either the hub or the spoke,\nshared by both, or shared with IT.  Deciding where responsibility should lie\nwithin an organization is not an exact science, but it should be influenced by\nthree factors:\n\n**The maturity of AI capabilities.** When a company is early in its AI\njourney, it often makes sense for analytics executives, data scientists, data\nengineers, user interface designers, visualization specialists who graphically\ninterpret analytics findings, and the like to sit within a hub and be deployed\nas needed to the spokes. Working together, these players can establish the\ncompany\u2019s core AI assets and capabilities, such as common analytics tools,\ndata processes, and delivery methodologies. But as time passes and processes\nbecome standardized, these experts can reside within the spokes just as (or\nmore) effectively.\n\n**Business model complexity.** The greater the number of business functions,\nlines of business, or geographies AI tools will support, the greater the need\nto build guilds of AI experts (of, say, data scientists or designers).\nCompanies with complex businesses often consolidate these guilds in the hub\nand then assign them out as needed to business units, functions, or\ngeographies.\n\n**The pace and level of technical innovation required.** When they need to\ninnovate rapidly, some companies put more gray-area strategy and capability\nbuilding in the hub, so they can monitor industry and technology changes\nbetter and quickly deploy AI resources to head off competitive challenges.\n\nLet\u2019s return to the two financial institutions we discussed earlier. Both\nfaced competitive pressures that required rapid innovation. However, their\nanalytics maturity and business complexity differed.\n\nThe institution that placed its analytics teams within its hub had a much more\ncomplex business model and relatively low AI maturity. Its existing AI\nexpertise was primarily in risk management. By concentrating its data\nscientists, engineers, and many other gray-area experts within the hub, the\ncompany ensured that all business units and functions could rapidly access\nessential know-how when needed.\n\nThe second financial institution had a much simpler business model that\ninvolved specializing in fewer financial services. This bank also had\nsubstantial AI experience and expertise. So it was able to decentralize its AI\ntalent, embedding many of its gray-area analytics, strategy, and technology\nexperts within the business-unit spokes.\n\nAs these examples suggest, some art is involved in deciding where\nresponsibilities should live. Every organization has distinctive capabilities\nand competitive pressures, and the three key factors must be considered in\ntotality, rather than individually. For example, an organization might have\nhigh business complexity and need very rapid innovation (suggesting it should\nshift more responsibilities to the hub) but also have very mature AI\ncapabilities (suggesting it should move them to the spokes). Its leaders would\nhave to weigh the relative importance of all three factors to determine where,\non balance, talent would most effectively be deployed. Talent levels (an\nelement of AI maturity) often have an outsize influence on the decision. Does\nthe organization have enough data experts that, if it moved them permanently\nto the spokes, it could still fill the needs of all business units, functions,\nand geographies? If not, it would probably be better to house them in the hub\nand share them throughout the organization.\n\n### Oversight and execution.\n\nWhile the distribution of AI and analytics responsibilities varies from one\norganization to the next, those that scale up AI have two things in common:\n\n**[A governing coalition](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-\nfunctions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/rebooting-analytics-leadership-time-\nto-move-beyond-the-math) of business, IT, and analytics leaders.** Fully\nintegrating AI is a long journey. Creating a joint task force to oversee it\nwill ensure that the three functions collaborate and share accountability,\nregardless of how roles and responsibilities are divided. This group, which is\noften convened by the chief analytics officer, can also be instrumental in\nbuilding momentum for AI initiatives, especially early on.\n\n**Assignment-based execution teams.** Organizations that scale up AI are twice\nas likely to set up interdisciplinary teams within the spokes. Such teams\nbring a diversity of perspectives together and solicit input from frontline\nstaff as they build, deploy, and monitor new AI capabilities. The teams are\nusually assembled at the outset of each initiative and draw skills from both\nthe hub and the spokes. Each generally includes the manager in charge of the\nnew AI tool\u2019s success (the \u201cproduct owner\u201d), translators, data architects,\nengineers and scientists, designers, visualization specialists, and business\nanalysts. These teams address implementation issues early and extract value\nfaster.\n\nSome art is involved in deciding where AI responsibilities and roles should\nlive.\n\nFor example, at the Asian Pacific retailer that was using AI to optimize store\nspace and inventory placement, an interdisciplinary execution team helped\nbreak down walls between merchandisers (who determined how items would be\ndisplayed in stores) and buyers (who chose the range of products). Previously,\neach group had worked independently, with the buyers altering the AI\nrecommendations as they saw fit. That led to a mismatch between inventory\npurchased and space available. By inviting both groups to collaborate on the\nfurther development of the AI tool, the team created a more effective model\nthat provided a range of weighted options to the buyers, who could then choose\nthe best ones with input from the merchandisers. At the end of the process,\ngross margins on each product category that had applied the tool increased by\n4% to 7%.\n\n## Educating Everyone\n\nTo ensure the adoption of AI, companies need to educate everyone, from the top\nleaders down. To this end some are launching internal AI academies, which\ntypically incorporate classroom work (online or in person), workshops, on-the-\njob training, and even site visits to experienced industry peers. Most\nacademies initially hire external faculty to write the curricula and deliver\ntraining, but they also usually put in place processes to build in-house\ncapabilities.\n\nEvery academy is different, but most offer four broad types of instruction:\n\n### Leadership.\n\nMost academies strive to give senior executives and business-unit leaders a\nhigh-level understanding of how AI works and ways to identify and prioritize\nAI opportunities. They also provide discussions of the impact on workers\u2019\nroles, barriers to adoption, and talent development, and offer guidance on\ninstilling the underlying cultural changes required.\n\n### Analytics.\n\nHere the focus is on constantly sharpening the hard and soft skills of data\nscientists, engineers, architects, and other employees who are responsible for\ndata analytics, data governance, and building the AI solutions.\n\n### Translator.\n\nAnalytics translators often come from the business staff and need fundamental\ntechnical training\u2014for instance, in how to apply analytical approaches to\nbusiness problems and develop AI use cases. Their instruction may include\nonline tutorials, hands-on experience shadowing veteran translators, and a\nfinal \u201cexam\u201d in which they must successfully implement an AI initiative.\n\n#### 10 Ways to Derail an AI Program\n\nDespite big investments, many organizations get disappointing results from\ntheir AI and analytics efforts. What makes programs go off track? Companies\nset themselves up to fail when:\n\n  1. They lack a clear understanding of advanced analytics, staffing up with data scientists, engineers, and other key players without realizing how advanced and traditional analytics differ.\n  2. They don\u2019t assess feasibility, business value, and time horizons, and launch pilots without thinking through how to balance short-term wins in the first year with longer-term payoffs. \n  3. They have no strategy beyond a few use cases, tackling AI in an ad hoc way without considering the big-picture opportunities and threats AI presents in their industry.\n  4. They don\u2019t clearly define key roles, because they don\u2019t understand the tapestry of skill sets and tasks that a strong AI program requires.\n  5. They lack \u201ctranslators,\u201d or experts who can bridge the business and analytics realms by identifying high-value use cases, communicating business needs to tech experts, and generating buy-in with business users.\n  6. They isolate analytics from the business, rigidly centralizing it or locking it in poorly coordinated silos, rather than organizing it in ways that allow analytics and business experts to work closely together.\n  7. They squander time and money on enterprisewide data cleaning instead of aligning data consolidation and cleanup with their most valuable use cases.\n  8. They fully build out analytics platforms before identifying business cases, setting up architectures like data lakes without knowing what they\u2019ll be needed for and often integrating platforms with legacy systems unnecessarily.\n  9. They neglect to quantify analytics\u2019 bottom-line impact, lacking a performance management framework with clear metrics for tracking each initiative.\n  10. They fail to focus on ethical, social, and regulatory implications, leaving themselves vulnerable to potential missteps when it comes to data acquisition and use, algorithmic bias, and other risks, and exposing themselves to social and legal consequences.\n\n_For more details, read[\u201cTen Red Flags Signaling Your Analytics Program Will\nFail\u201d](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-\ninsights/ten-red-flags-signaling-your-analytics-program-will-fail) on\nMcKinsey.com._\n\n### End user.\n\nFrontline workers may need only a general introduction to new AI tools,\nfollowed by on-the-job training and coaching in how to use them. Strategic\ndecision makers, such as marketers and finance staff, may require higher-level\ntraining sessions that incorporate real business scenarios in which new tools\nimprove decisions about, say, product launches.\n\n## Reinforcing the Change\n\nMost AI transformations take 18 to 36 months to complete, with some taking as\nlong as five years. To prevent them from losing momentum, leaders need to do\nfour things:\n\n### Walk the talk.\n\nRole modeling is essential. For starters, leaders can demonstrate their\ncommitment to AI by attending academy training.\n\nBut they also must actively encourage new ways of working. AI requires\nexperimentation, and often early iterations don\u2019t work out as planned. When\nthat happens, leaders should highlight what was learned from the pilots. That\nwill help encourage appropriate risk taking.\n\nThe most effective role models we\u2019ve seen are humble. They ask questions and\nreinforce the value of diverse perspectives. They regularly meet with staff to\ndiscuss the data, asking questions such as \u201cHow often are we right?\u201d and \u201cWhat\ndata do we have to support today\u2019s decision?\u201d\n\nThe CEO of one specialty retailer we know is a good example. At every meeting\nshe goes to, she invites attendees to share their experience and opinions\u2014and\noffers hers last. She also makes time to meet with business and analytics\nemployees every few weeks to see what they\u2019ve done\u2014whether it\u2019s launching a\nnew pilot or scaling up an existing one.\n\n### Make businesses accountable.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to see analytics staff made the owners of AI products.\nHowever, because analytics are simply a means of solving business problems,\nit\u2019s the business units that must lead projects and be responsible for their\nsuccess. Ownership ought to be assigned to someone from the relevant business,\nwho should map out roles and guide a proj\u00adect from start to finish. Sometimes\norganizations assign different owners at different points in the development\nlife cycle (for instance, for proof of value, deployment, and scaling). That\u2019s\na mistake too, because it can result in loose ends or missed opportunities.\n\nA scorecard that captures proj\u00adect performance metrics for all stakeholders is\nan excellent way to align the goals of analytics and business teams. One\nairline company, for instance, used a shared scorecard to measure rate of\nadoption, speed to full capability, and business outcomes for an AI solution\nthat optimized pricing and booking.\n\n### Track and facilitate adoption.\n\nComparing the results of decisions made with and without AI can encourage\nemployees to use it. For example, at one commodity company, traders learned\nthat their non-AI-supported forecasts were typically right only half the\ntime\u2014no better than guessing. That discovery made them more open to AI tools\nfor improved forecasting.\n\nThe business units must lead AI projects and be responsible for their success.\n\nTeams that monitor implementation can correct course as needed. At one North\nAmerican retailer, an AI proj\u00adect owner saw store managers struggling to\nincorporate a pilot\u2019s output into their tracking of store performance results.\nThe AI\u2019s user interface was difficult to navigate, and the AI insights\ngenerated weren\u2019t integrated into the dashboards the managers relied on every\nday to make decisions. To fix the issue, the AI team simplified the interface\nand reconfigured the output so that the new data stream appeared in the\ndashboard.\n\n### Provide incentives for change.\n\nAcknowledgment inspires employees for the long haul. The CEO of the specialty\nretailer starts meetings by shining a spotlight on an employee (such as a\nproduct manager, a data scientist, or a frontline worker) who has helped make\nthe company\u2019s AI program a success. At the large retail conglomerate, the CEO\ncreated new roles for top performers who participated in the AI\ntransformation. For instance, he promoted the category manager who helped test\nthe optimization solution during its pilot to lead its rollout across\nstores\u2014visibly demonstrating the career impact that embracing AI could have.\n\nFinally, firms have to check that employees\u2019 incentives are truly aligned with\nAI use. This was not the case at a brick-and-mortar retailer that had\ndeveloped an AI model to optimize discount pricing so that it could clear out\nold stock. The model revealed that sometimes it was more profitable to dispose\nof old stock than to sell it at a discount, but the store personnel had\nincentives to sell everything, even at steep discounts. Because the AI\nrecommendations contradicted their standard, rewarded practice, employees\nbecame suspicious of the tool and ignored it. Since their sales incentives\nwere also closely tied to contracts and couldn\u2019t easily be changed, the\norganization ultimately updated the AI model to recognize the trade-off\nbetween profits and the incentives, which helped drive user adoption and\nlifted the bottom line.\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nThe actions that promote scale in AI create a virtuous circle. The move from\nfunctional to interdisciplinary teams initially brings together the diverse\nskills and perspectives and the user input needed to build effective tools. In\ntime, workers across the organization absorb new collaborative practices. As\nthey work more closely with colleagues in other functions and geographies,\nemployees begin to think bigger\u2014they move from trying to solve discrete\nproblems to completely reimagining business and operating models. The speed of\ninnovation picks up as the rest of the organization begins to adopt the test-\nand-learn approaches that successfully propelled the pilots.\n\nAs AI tools spread throughout the organization, those closest to the action\nbecome increasingly able to make decisions once made by those above them,\nflattening organizational hierarchies. That encourages further collaboration\nand even bigger thinking.\n\nThe ways AI can be used to augment decision making keep expanding.

He will lead the finance division which will now\ninclude IT, HR, administration and accounting. The administration and\ncommunications division has been made redundant. Marketing which used to\nbelong to that division will now become part of the consumer sales division\nwhich, as previously mentioned, is going to be directly led by CEO \u00c1rni P\u00e9tur\nJ\u00f3nsson.\n\n**A NEW CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER**\n\n\u00d3lafur \u00de\u00f3r J\u00f3hannesson has been appointed the new Chief Financial Officer of\nSkeljungur hf.\n\n\u00d3lafur has been an independent consultant since 2018 and has served on various\ncompany boards during this same time. Prior to that he held the position of\nCFO and Vice-CEO of Basko ehf., from 2012-2018. \u00d3lafur was the CEO of Mi\u00f0engi\nehf., a holding company owned by \u00cdslandsbanki, 2010-2012. From 2006-2010 he\nwas CFO of Teymi hf., which was a listed company on the Icelandic Stock\nExchange. From 1996-2006, \u00d3lafur worked in the audit practise of\nPricewaterhouseCoopers, the last few years as a full partner. During this\nperiod, he was a member of the University CPA Examination committee. \u00d3lafur\nhas a cand.oecon degree in business from the University of Iceland and is a\ncertified public accountant.\n\n**THE EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT OF SKELJUNGUR**\n\n  * \u00c1rni P\u00e9tur J\u00f3nsson, CEO\n  * Gr\u00f3a Bj\u00f6rg Baldvinsd\u00f3ttir, Head of Legal\n  * M\u00e1r Erlingsson, Chief Operating Officer and Vice-CEO\n  * \u00d3lafur \u00de\u00f3r J\u00f3hannesson, Chief Financial Officer\n  * \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0ur Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsson, Chief Commercial Officer\n\n\u00c1rni P\u00e9tur J\u00f3nsson, CEO of Skeljungur:\n\n_\u201cWith the changed organizational chart for Skeljungur we\u2019re separating\ncommercial sales from consumer sales. Simultaneously we intend to emphasis\nmore on our brand Orkan, which was the first low-cost brand for consumer fuel\nsales in Iceland. It is my opinion that the company has the opportunity to\nstrengthen its position in the fuel market._\n\n_It is a very good news to have \u00d3lafur \u00de\u00f3r to join our organisation. I believe\nthat his many skills and long experience will prove invaluable to Skeljungur\nin our coming endeavours. \u00d3lafur is a Certified Public Accountant and has\nprevious experience as CFO of a listed company on the Icelandic Stock\nExchange. I consider \u00d3lafur to be an important member of the company\u2019s\nmanagement._\n\n_The decision to increase the number of members in the management, from four\nto five, gives us broader perspective than before, more diverse team. Gr\u00f3a\nBj\u00f6rg has been with Skeljungur for almost 3 years and has proven that she is a\nvery skilled manager. She enters the management with her knowledge and\nexperience. To have such a capable woman join our leadership team will prove\nimportant for this organisation.\u201d_\n\n_For further information please contact \u00c1rni P\u00e9tur J\u00f3nsson, CEO.

As a consequence,\nhiring extraordinary talent is vital to our success and can never be taken for\ngranted. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we faced a challenge that\nwas, frankly, relatively new to our now 150-year-old firm. For decades\ninvestment banking had been one of the most sought-after, exciting, and fast-\ngrowing industries in the world. That made sense--we were growing by double\ndigits and had high returns, which meant that opportunity and reward were in\ngreat supply. However, the crash took some of the sheen off our industry; both\ngrowth and returns moderated. And simultaneously, the battle for talent\nintensified--within and outside our industry. Many of the candidates we were\npursuing were heading off to Silicon Valley, private equity, or start-ups.\nFurthermore, we were no longer principally looking for a specialized cadre of\naccounting, finance, and economics majors: New skills, especially coding, were\nin huge demand at Goldman Sachs--and pretty much everywhere else. The wind had\nshifted from our backs to our faces, and we needed to respond.\n\nRelated Video\n\n  * [__Save](/video/6026736199001)\n  * [__Share](/video/6026736199001)\n\nNot long ago the firm relied on a narrower set of factors for identifying \"the\nbest\" students, such as school, GPA, major, leadership roles, and relevant\nexperience--the classic resume topics. No longer. We decided to replace our\nhiring playbook with emerging best practices for assessment and recruitment,\nso we put together a task force of senior business leaders, PhDs in industrial\nand organizational psychology, data scientists, and experts in recruiting.\nSome people asked, \"Why overhaul a recruiting process that has proved so\nsuccessful?\" and \"Don't you already have many more qualified applicants than\navailable jobs?\" These were reasonable questions. But often staying successful\nis about learning and changing rather than sticking to the tried-and-true.\n\nEach year we hire up to 3,000 summer interns and nearly as many new analysts\ndirectly from campuses. In our eyes, these are the firm's future leaders, so\nit made sense to focus our initial reforms there. They involved two major\nadditions to our campus recruiting strategy--video interviews and structured\ninterviewing.\n\n### Asynchronous video interviews.\n\nTraditionally we had flown recruiters and business professionals to\nuniversities for first-round interviews. The schools would give us a set date\nand number of time slots to meet with students. That is most definitely not a\nscalable model. It restricted us to a smaller number of campuses and only as\nmany students as we could squeeze into a limited schedule. It also meant that\nwe tended to focus on top-ranked schools. How many qualified candidates were\nat a school became more important than who were the most talented students\nregardless of their school. However, we knew that candidates didn't have to\nattend Harvard, Princeton, or Oxford to excel at Goldman Sachs--our leadership\nranks were already rich with people from other schools. What's more, as we've\nbuilt offices in new cities and geographic locations, we've needed to recruit\nat more schools located in those areas. Video interviews allow us to do that.\n\nAt a time when companies were just beginning to experiment with digital\ninterviewing, we decided to use \"asynchronous\" video interviews--in which\ncandidates record their answers to interview questions--for all first-round\ninteractions with candidates. Our recruiters record standardized questions and\nsend them to students, who have three days to return videos of their answers.\nThis can be done on a computer or a mobile device. Our recruiters and business\nprofessionals review the videos to narrow the pool and then invite the\nselected applicants to a Goldman Sachs office for final-round, in-person\ninterviews. (To create the video platform, we partnered with a company and\nbuilt our own digital solution around its product.)\n\nThis approach has had a meaningful impact in two ways. First, with limited\neffort, we can now spend more time getting to know the people who apply for\njobs at Goldman Sachs. In 2015, the year before we rolled out this platform,\nwe interviewed fewer than 20% of all our campus applicants; in 2018 almost 40%\nof the students who applied to the firm participated in a first-round\ninterview. Second, we now encounter talent from places we previously didn't\nget to. In 2015 we interviewed students from 798 schools around the world,\ncompared with 1,268 for our most recent incoming class. In the United States,\nwhere the majority of our student hires historically came from \"target\nschools,\" the opposite is now true. The top of our recruiting funnel is wider,\nand the output is more diverse.\n\nBeing a people-driven business, we have worked hard to ensure that the video\ninterviews don't feel cold and impersonal. They are only one component of a\nbroader process that makes up the Goldman Sachs recruitment experience. We\nstill regularly send Goldman professionals to campuses to engage directly with\nstudents at informational sessions, \"coffee chats,\" and other recruiting\nevents. But now our goal is much more to share information than to assess\ncandidates, because we want people to understand the firm and what it offers\nbefore they tell us why they want an internship or a job.\n\nOur structured interview questions are designed to assess 10 core\ncompetencies.\n\nWe also want them to be as well prepared as possible for our interview\nprocess. Our goal is a level playing field. To help achieve it, we've created\ntip sheets and instructions on preparing for a video interview. Because the\nplatform doesn't allow videos to be edited once they've been recorded, we\noffer a practice question before the interview begins and a countdown before\nthe questions are asked. We also give students a formal channel for escalating\nissues should technical problems arise, though that rarely occurs.\n\nWe're confident that this approach has created a better experience for\nrecruits. It uses a medium they've grown up with (video), and most important,\nthey can do their interviews when they feel fresh and at a time that works\nwith their schedule. (Our data shows that they prefer Thursday or Sunday night\n--whereas our previous practice was to interview during working hours.) We\nsuspected that if the process was a turnoff for applicants, we would see a dip\nin the percentage who accepted our interviews and our offers. That hasn't\nhappened.\n\n### Structured questioning and assessments.\n\nHow can you create an assessment process that not only helps select top talent\nbut focuses on specific characteristics associated with success? Define it,\nstructure it, and don't deviate from it. Research shows that structured\ninterviews are effective at assessing candidates and helping predict job\nperformance. So we ask candidates about specific experiences they've had that\nare similar to situations they may face at Goldman Sachs (\"Tell me about a\ntime when you were working on a project with someone who was not completing\nhis or her tasks\") and pose hypothetical scenarios they might encounter in the\nfuture (\"In an elevator, you overhear confidential information about a\ncoworker who is also a friend. The friend approaches you and asks if you've\nheard anything negative about him recently. What do you do?\").\n\nEssentially, we are focused less on past achievements and more on\nunderstanding whether a candidate has qualities that will positively affect\nour firm and our culture. Our structured interview questions are designed to\nassess candidates on 10 core competencies, including analytical thinking and\nintegrity, which we know correlate with long-term success at the firm. They\nare evaluated on six competencies in the first round; if they progress,\nthey're assessed on the remaining four during in-person interviews.\n\nWe have a rotating library of questions for each competency, along with a\nrubric for interviewers that explains how to rate responses on a five-point\nscale from \"outstanding\" to \"poor.\" We also train our interviewers to conduct\nstructured interviews, provide them with prep materials immediately before\nthey interview a candidate, and run detailed calibration meetings using all\nthe candidate data we've gathered throughout the recruiting process to ensure\nthat certain interviewers aren't introducing grade inflation (or deflation).\nWe're experimenting with prehire assessment tests to be paired with these\ninterviews; we already offer a technical coding and math exam for applicants\nto our engineering organization.\n\nWe decided not to pilot these changes and instead rolled them out en masse,\nbecause we realized that buy-in would come from being able to show results\nquickly--and because we know that no process is perfect. Indeed, what I love\nmost about our new approach is that we've turned our recruiting department\ninto a laboratory for continuous learning and refinement. With more than\n50,000 candidate video recordings, we're now sitting on a treasure trove of\ndata that will help us conduct insightful analyses and answer questions\nnecessary to run our business: Are we measuring the right competencies? Should\nsome be weighted more heavily than others? What about the candidates'\nbackgrounds? Which interviewers are most effective? Does a top-ranked student\nat a state school create more value for us than an average student from the\nIvy League? We already have indications that students recruited from the new\nschools in our pool perform just as well as students from our traditional ones\n--and in some cases are more likely to stay longer at the firm.\n\nWhat's next for our recruiting efforts? We receive almost 500,000 applications\neach year. From this pool we hire approximately 3%. We believe that many of\nthe other 97% could be very successful at Goldman Sachs. As a result, picking\nthe right 3% is less about just the individual and increasingly about matching\nthe right person to the right role. That match may be made straight out of\ncollege or years later. We're experimenting with resume-reading algorithms\nthat will help candidates identify the business departments best suited to\ntheir skills and interests. We're looking at how virtual reality might help us\nbetter educate students about working in our offices and in our industry. And\nwe're evaluating various tools and tests to bring even more data into the\nhiring decision process. Can I imagine a future in which companies rely\nexclusively on machines and algorithms to rate resumes and interviews? Maybe,\nfor some. But I don't see us ever eliminating the human element at Goldman\nSachs; it's too deeply embedded in our culture, in the work we do, and in what\nwe believe drives success.\n\nI'm excited to see where this journey takes us. Our 2019 campus class is\nshaping up to be the most diverse ever--and it's composed entirely of people\nwho were selected through rigorous, objective assessments. There's no way we\naren't better off as a result.\n\n## Your Approach to Hiring Is All Wrong\n\n  * [Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter%20cappelli)\n\n  * __Save\n  * __Share\n\n#### Idea in Brief\n\n##### The Problem\n\nEmployers continue to hire at a high rate and spend enormous sums to do it.\nBut they don't know whether their approaches are effective at finding and\nselecting good candidates.\n\n##### The Root Causes\n\nBusinesses focus on external candidates and don't track the results of their\napproaches. They often use outside vendors and high-tech tools that are\nunproven and have inherent flaws.\n\n##### The Solution\n\nReturn to filling most positions by promoting from within. Measure the results\nproduced by vendors and new tools, and be on the lookout for discrimination\nand privacy violations.\n\nBusinesses have never done as much hiring as they do today. They've never\nspent as much money doing it. And they've never done a worse job of it.\n\nFor most of the post-World War II era, large corporations went about hiring\nthis way: Human resources experts prepared a detailed _job analysis_ to\ndetermine what tasks the job required and what attributes a good candidate\nshould have. Next they did a _job evaluation_ to determine how the job fit\ninto the organizational chart and how much it should pay, especially compared\nwith other jobs. Ads were posted, and applicants applied. Then came the task\nof sorting through the applicants. That included skills tests, reference\nchecks, maybe personality and IQ tests, and extensive interviews to learn more\nabout them as people. William H. Whyte, in The Organization Man, described\nthis process as going on for as long as a week before the winning candidate\nwas offered the job. The vast majority of non-entry-level openings were filled\nfrom within.\n\nToday's approach couldn't be more different. Census data shows, for example,\nthat the majority of people who took a new job last year weren't searching for\none: Somebody came and got them. Companies seek to fill their recruiting\nfunnel with as many candidates as possible, especially \"passive candidates,\"\nwho aren't looking to move. Often employers advertise jobs that don't exist,\nhoping to find people who might be useful later on or in a different context.\n\nThe recruiting and hiring function has been eviscerated. Many U.S. companies--\nabout 40%, according to\n[research](https://staging.kornferry.com/media/sidebar_downloads/Measuring-Up-\nA-new-research-report-about-RPO-metrics.pdf) by Korn Ferry--have outsourced\nmuch if not all of the hiring process to \"recruitment process outsourcers,\"\nwhich in turn often use subcontractors, typically in India and the\nPhilippines. The subcontractors scour LinkedIn and social media to find\npotential candidates. They sometimes contact them directly to see whether they\ncan be persuaded to apply for a position and negotiate the salary they're\nwilling to accept. (The recruiters get incentive pay if they negotiate the\namount down.) To hire programmers, for example, these subcontractors can scan\nwebsites that programmers might visit, trace their \"digital exhaust\" from\ncookies and other user-tracking measures to identify who they are, and then\nexamine their curricula vitae.\n\nAt companies that still do their own recruitment and hiring, managers trying\nto fill open positions are largely left to figure out what the jobs require\nand what the ads should say. When applications come--always electronically--\napplicant-tracking software sifts through them for key words that the hiring\nmanagers want to see. Then the process moves into the Wild West, where a new\nindustry of vendors offer an astonishing array of smart-sounding tools that\nclaim to predict who will be a good hire. They use voice recognition, body\nlanguage, clues on social media, and especially machine learning algorithms--\neverything but tea leaves. Entire publications are devoted to what these\nvendors are doing.\n\nThe big problem with all these new practices is that we don't know whether\nthey actually produce satisfactory hires. Only about a third of U.S. companies\nreport that they monitor whether their hiring practices lead to good\nemployees; few of them do so carefully, and only a minority even track cost\nper hire and time to hire. Imagine if the CEO asked how an advertising\ncampaign had gone, and the response was \"We have a good idea how long it took\nto roll out and what it cost, but we haven't looked to see whether we're\nselling more.\"\n\nHiring talent remains the number one concern of CEOs in the most recent\nConference Board Annual Survey; it's also the top concern of the entire\nexecutive suite. PwC's 2017 CEO survey reports that chief executives view the\nunavailability of talent and skills as the biggest threat to their business.\nEmployers also spend an enormous amount on hiring--an average of $4,129 per\njob in the United States, according to Society for Human Resource Management\nestimates, and many times that amount for managerial roles--and the United\nStates fills a staggering 66 million jobs a year. Most of the $20 billion that\ncompanies spend on human resources vendors goes to hiring.\n\nWhy do employers spend so much on something so important while knowing so\nlittle about whether it works?\n\n## Where the Problem Starts\n\nSurvey after survey finds employers complaining about how difficult hiring is.\nThere may be many explanations, such as their having become very picky about\ncandidates, especially in the slack labor market of the Great Recession. But\nclearly they are hiring much more than at any other time in modern history,\nfor two reasons.\n\nThe first is that openings are now filled more often by hiring from the\noutside than by promoting from within. In the era of lifetime employment, from\nthe end of World War II through the 1970s, corporations filled roughly 90% of\ntheir vacancies through promotions and lateral assignments. Today the figure\nis a third or less. When they hire from outside, organizations don't have to\npay to train and develop their employees. Since the restructuring waves of the\nearly 1980s, it has been relatively easy to find experienced talent outside.\nOnly 28% of talent acquisition leaders today report that internal candidates\nare an important source of people to fill vacancies--presumably because of\nless internal development and fewer clear career ladders.\n\nLess promotion internally means that hiring efforts are no longer concentrated\non entry-level jobs and recent graduates. (If you doubt this, go to the\n\"careers\" link on any company website and look for a job opening that doesn't\nrequire prior experience.) Now companies must be good at hiring across most\nlevels, because the candidates they want are already doing the job somewhere\nelse. These people don't need training, so they may be ready to contribute\nright away, but they are much harder to find.\n\nThe second reason hiring is so difficult is that retention has become tough:\nCompanies hire from their competitors and vice versa, so they have to keep\nreplacing people who leave. Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows\nthat 95% of hiring is done to fill existing positions. Most of those vacancies\nare caused by voluntary turnover. LinkedIn data indicates that the most common\nreason employees consider a position elsewhere is career advancement--which is\nsurely related to employers' not promoting to fill vacancies.\n\nThe root cause of most hiring, therefore, is drastically poor retention. Here\nare some simple ways to fix that:\n\n### Track the percentage of openings filled from within.\n\nAn adage of business is that we manage what we measure, but companies don't\nseem to be applying that maxim to tracking hires. Most are shocked to learn\nhow few of their openings are filled from within--is it really the case that\ntheir people can't handle different and bigger roles?\n\n### Require that all openings be posted internally.\n\nInternal job boards were created during the dot-com boom to reduce turnover by\nmaking it easier for people to find new jobs within their existing employer.\nManagers weren't even allowed to know if a subordinate was looking to move\nwithin the company, for fear that they would try to block that person and he\nor she would leave. But during the Great Recession employees weren't quitting,\nand many companies slid back to the old model whereby managers could prevent\ntheir subordinates from moving internally. JR Keller, of Cornell University,\nhas found that when managers could fill a vacancy with someone they already\nhad in mind, they ended up with employees who performed more poorly than those\nhired when the job had been posted and anyone could apply. The commonsense\nexplanation for this is that few enterprises really know what talent and\ncapabilities they have.\n\n#### Protecting Against Discrimination\n\nFinding out whether your practices result in good hires is not only basic to\ngood management but the only real defense against claims of adverse impact and\ndiscrimination. Other than white males under age 40 with no disabilities or\nwork-related health problems, workers have special protections under federal\nand state laws against hiring practices that may have an adverse impact on\nthem. As a practical matter, that means if members of a particular group are\nless likely to be recruited or hired, the employer must show that the hiring\nprocess is not discriminatory.\n\nThe only defense against evidence of adverse impact is for the employer to\nshow that its hiring practices are valid--that is, they predict who will be a\ngood employee in meaningful and statistically significant ways--and that no\nalternative would predict as well with less adverse impact. That analysis must\nbe conducted with data on the employer's own applicants and hires. The fact\nthat the vendor that sold you the test you use has evidence that it was valid\nin other contexts is not sufficient.\n\n### Recognize the costs of outside hiring.\n\nIn addition to the time and effort of hiring, my colleague Matthew Bidwell\nfound, outside hires take three years to perform as well as internal hires in\nthe same job, while internal hires take seven years to earn as much as outside\nhires are paid. Outside hiring also causes current employees to spend time and\nenergy positioning themselves for jobs elsewhere. It disrupts the culture and\nburdens peers who must help new hires figure out how things work.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that outside hiring is necessarily a bad idea. But\nunless your company is a Silicon Valley gazelle, adding new jobs at a furious\npace, you should ask yourself some serious questions if most of your openings\nare being filled from outside.\n\nEmployers are obsessed with new technologies and driving down costs.\n\nA different approach for dealing with retention (which seems creepy to some)\nis to try to determine who is interested in leaving and then intervene.\nVendors like Jobvite comb social media and public sites for clues, such as\nLinkedIn profile updates. Measuring \"flight risk\" is one of the most common\ngoals of companies that do their own sophisticated HR analytics. This is\nreminiscent of the early days of job boards, when employers would try to find\nout who was posting resumes and either punish them or embrace them, depending\non leadership's mood.\n\nWhether companies should be examining social media content in relation to\nhiring or any other employment action is a challenging ethical question. On\none hand, the information is essentially public and may reveal relevant\ninformation. On the other hand, it is invasive, and candidates are rarely\nasked for permission to scrutinize their information. Hiring a private\ndetective to shadow a candidate would also gather public information that\nmight be relevant, yet most people would view it as an unacceptable invasion\nof privacy.\n\n## The Hiring Process\n\nWhen we turn to hiring itself, we find that employers are missing the forest\nfor the trees: Obsessed with new technologies and driving down costs, they\nlargely ignore the ultimate goal: making the best possible hires. Here's how\nthe process should be revamped:\n\n### Don't post \"phantom jobs.\"\n\nIt costs nothing to post job openings on a company website, which are then\nscooped up by Indeed and other online companies and pushed out to potential\njob seekers around the world. Thus it may be unsurprising that some of these\njobs don't really exist. Employers may simply be fishing for candidates.\n(\"Let's see if someone really great is out there, and if so, we'll create a\nposition for him or her.\") Often job ads stay up even after positions have\nbeen filled, to keep collecting candidates for future vacancies or just\nbecause it takes more effort to pull the ad down than to leave it up.\nSometimes ads are posted by unscrupulous recruiters looking for resumes to\npitch to clients elsewhere. Because these phantom jobs make the labor market\nlook tighter than it really is, they are a problem for economic policy makers\nas well as for frustrated job seekers. Companies should take ads down when\njobs are filled.\n\n### Design jobs with realistic requirements.\n\nFiguring out what the requirements of a job should be--and the corresponding\nattributes candidates must have--is a bigger challenge now, because so many\ncompanies have reduced the number of internal recruiters whose function, in\npart, is to push back on hiring managers' wish lists. (\"That job doesn't\nrequire 10 years of experience,\" or \"No one with all those qualifications will\nbe willing to accept the salary you're proposing to pay.\") My earlier research\nfound that companies piled on job requirements, baked them into the applicant-\ntracking software that sorted resumes according to binary decisions (yes, it\nhas the key word; no, it doesn't), and then found that virtually no applicants\nmet all the criteria. Trimming recruiters, who have expertise in hiring, and\nhanding the process over to hiring managers is a prime example of being penny-\nwise and pound-foolish.\n\n### Reconsider your focus on passive candidates.\n\nThe recruiting process begins with a search for experienced people who aren't\nlooking to move. This is based on the notion that something may be wrong with\nanyone who wants to leave his or her current job. (Of the more than 20,000\ntalent professionals who responded to a LinkedIn survey in 2015, 86% said\ntheir recruiting organizations focused \"very much so\" or \"to some extent\" on\npassive candidates; I suspect that if anything, that number has since grown.)\nRecruiters know that the vast majority of people are open to moving at the\nright price: Surveys of employees find that only about 15% are _not_ open to\nmoving. As the economist Harold Demsetz said when asked by a competing\nuniversity if he was happy working where he was: \"Make me unhappy.\"\n\nFascinating evidence from the LinkedIn survey cited above shows that although\nself-identified \"passive\" job seekers are different from \"active\" job seekers,\nit's not in the way we might think. The number one factor that would encourage\nthe former to move is more money. For active candidates the top factor is\nbetter work and career opportunities. More active than passive job seekers\nreport that they are passionate about their work, engaged in improving their\nskills, and reasonably satisfied with their current jobs. They seem interested\nin moving because they are ambitious, not because they want higher pay.\n\nEmployers spend a vastly disproportionate amount of their budgets on\nrecruiters who chase passive candidates, but on average they fill only 11% of\ntheir positions with individually targeted people, according to research by\nGerry Crispin and Chris Hoyt, of CareerXroads. I know of no evidence that\npassive candidates become better employees, let alone that the process is\ncost-effective. If you focus on passive candidates, think carefully about what\nthat actually gets you. Better yet, check your data to find out.\n\n### Understand the limits of referrals.\n\nThe most popular channel for finding new hires is through employee referrals;\nup to 48% come from them, according to LinkedIn research. It seems like a\ncheap way to go, but does it produce better hires? Many employers think so.\nIt's hard to know whether that's true, however, given that they don't check.\nAnd research by Emilio Castilla and colleagues suggests otherwise: They find\nthat when referrals work out better than other hires, it's because their\nreferrers look after them and essentially onboard them. If a referrer leaves\nbefore the new hire begins, the latter's performance is no better than that of\nnonreferrals, which is why it makes sense to pay referral bonuses six months\nor so after the person is hired--if he or she is still there.\n\nA downside to referrals, of course, is that they can lead to a homogeneous\nworkforce, because the people we know tend to be like us. This matters greatly\nfor organizations interested in diversity, since recruiting is the only avenue\nallowed under U.S. law to increase diversity in a workforce. The Supreme Court\nhas ruled that demographic criteria cannot be used even to break ties among\ncandidates.\n\n### Measure the results.\n\nFew employers know which channel produces the best candidates at the lowest\ncost because they don't track the outcomes. Tata is an exception: It has long\ndone what I advocate. For college recruiting, for example, it calculates which\nschools send it employees who perform the best, stay the longest, and are paid\nthe lowest starting wage. Other employers should follow suit and monitor\nrecruiting channels and employees' performance to identify which sources\nproduce the best results.\n\n### Persuade fewer people to apply.\n\nThe hiring industry pays a great deal of attention to \"the funnel,\" whereby\nreaders of a company's job postings become applicants, are interviewed, and\nultimately are offered jobs. Contrary to the popular belief that the U.S. job\nmarket is extremely tight right now, most jobs still get lots of applicants.\nRecruiting and hiring consultants and vendors estimate that about 2% of\napplicants receive offers. Unfortunately, the main effort to improve hiring--\nvirtually always aimed at making it faster and cheaper--has been to shovel\nmore applicants into the funnel. Employers do that primarily through\nmarketing, trying to get out the word that they are great places to work.\nWhether doing this is a misguided way of trying to attract better hires or\njust meant to make the organization feel more desirable isn't clear.\n\n## The Grass Is Always Greener\u2026\n\nOrganizations are much more interested in external talent than in their own\nemployees to fill vacancies. Here are the top channels for quality hires.  \n![R1903B_SPOT_GRASS.png](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/04/R1903B_SPOT_GRASS.png)\n\nMuch better to go in the other direction: Create a smaller but better-\nqualified applicant pool to improve the yield. Here's why: Every applicant\ncosts you money--especially now, in a labor market where applicants have\nstarted to \"ghost\" employers, abandoning their applications midway through the\nprocess. Every application also exposes a company to legal risk, because the\ncompany has obligations to candidates (not to discriminate, for example) just\nas it does to employees. And collecting lots of applicants in a wide funnel\nmeans that a great many of them won't fit the job or the company, so employers\nhave to rely on the next step of the hiring process--selection--to weed them\nout. As we will see, employers aren't good at that.\n\nOnce people are candidates, they may not be completely honest about their\nskills or interests--because they want to be hired--and employers' ability to\nfind out the truth is limited. More than a generation ago the psychologist\nJohn Wanous proposed giving applicants a realistic preview of what the job is\nlike. That still makes sense as a way to head off those who would end up being\nunhappy in the job. It's not surprising that Google has found a way to do this\nwith gamification: Job seekers see what the work would be like by playing a\ngame version of it. Marriott has done the same, even for low-level employees.\nIts My Marriott Hotel game targets young people in developing countries who\nmay have had little experience in hotels to show them what it's like and to\nsteer them to the recruiting site if they score well on the game. The key for\nany company, though, is that the preview should make clear what is difficult\nand challenging about the work as well as why it's fun so that candidates who\ndon't fit won't apply.\n\nIt should be easy for candidates to learn about a company and a job, but\nmaking it really easy to apply, just to fill up that funnel, doesn't make much\nsense. During the dot-com boom Texas Instruments cleverly introduced a\npreemployment test that allowed applicants to see their scores before they\napplied. If their scores weren't high enough for the company to take their\napplications seriously, they tended not to proceed, and the company saved the\ncost of having to process their applications.\n\nIf the goal is to get better hires in a cost-effective manner, it's more\nimportant to scare away candidates who don't fit than to jam more candidates\ninto the recruiting funnel.\n\n### Test candidates' standard skills.\n\nHow to determine which candidates to hire--what predicts who will be a good\nemployee--has been rigorously studied at least since World War I. The\npersonnel psychologists who investigated this have learned much about\npredicting good hires that contemporary organizations have since forgotten,\nsuch as that neither college grades nor unstructured sequential interviews\n(hopping from office to office) are a good predictor, whereas past performance\nis.\n\nSince it can be difficult (if not impossible) to glean sufficient information\nabout an outside applicant's past performance, what other predictors are good?\nThere is remarkably little consensus even among experts. That's mainly because\na typical job can have so many tasks and aspects, and different factors\npredict success at different tasks.\n\nThere is general agreement, however, that testing to see whether individuals\nhave standard skills is about the best we can do. Can the candidate speak\nFrench? Can she do simple programming tasks? And so forth. But just doing the\ntests is not enough. The economists Mitchell Hoffman, Lisa B. Kahn, and\nDanielle Li found that even when companies conduct such tests, hiring managers\noften ignore them--and when they do, they get worse hires. The psychologist\nNathan Kuncel and colleagues discovered that even when hiring managers use\nobjective criteria and tests, applying their own weights and judgment to those\ncriteria leads them to pick worse candidates than if they had used a standard\nformula. Only 40% of employers, however, do any tests of skills or general\nabilities, including IQ. What are they doing instead? Seventy-four percent do\ndrug tests, including for marijuana use; even employers in states where\nrecreational use is now legal still seem to do so.\n\n### Be wary of vendors bearing high-tech gifts.\n\nInto the testing void has come a new group of entrepreneurs who either are\ndata scientists or have them in tow. They bring a fresh approach to the hiring\nprocess--but often with little understanding of how hiring actually works.\nJohn Sumser, of HRExaminer, an online newsletter that focuses on HR\ntechnology, estimates that on average, companies get five to seven pitches\n_every day_ --almost all of them about hiring--from vendors using data science\nto address HR issues. These vendors have all sorts of cool-sounding\nassessments, such as computer games that can be scored to predict who will be\na good hire. We don't know whether any of these actually lead to better hires,\nbecause few of them are validated against actual job performance. That aside,\nthese assessments have spawned a counterwave of vendors who help candidates\nlearn how to score well on them. Lloyds Bank, for example, developed a\nvirtual-reality-based assessment of candidate potential, and JobTestPrep\noffers to teach potential candidates how to do well on it. Especially for IT\nand technical jobs, cheating on skills tests and even video interviews (where\ncolleagues off camera give help) is such a concern that eTeki and other\nspecialized vendors help employers figure out who is cheating in real time.\n\n### Revamp your interviewing process.\n\nThe amount of time employers spend on interviews has almost doubled since\n2009, according to research from Glassdoor. How much of that increase\nrepresents delays in setting up those interviews is impossible to tell, but it\nprovides at least a partial explanation for why it takes longer to fill jobs\nnow. Interviews are arguably the most difficult technique to get right,\nbecause interviewers should stick to questions that predict good hires--mainly\nabout past behavior or performance that's relevant to the tasks of the job--\nand ask them consistently across candidates. Just winging it and asking\nwhatever comes to mind is next to useless.\n\nMore important, interviews are where biases most easily show up, because\ninterviewers do usually decide on the fly what to ask of whom and how to\ninterpret the answer. Everyone knows some executive who is absolutely certain\nhe knows the one question that will really predict good candidates (\"If you\nwere stranded on a desert island\u2026\"). The sociologist Lauren Rivera's\nexamination of interviews for elite positions, such as those in professional\nservices firms, indicates that hobbies, particularly those associated with the\nrich, feature prominently as a selection criterion.\n\nInterviews are most important for assessing \"fit with our culture,\" which is\nthe number one hiring criterion employers report using, according to research\nfrom the Rockefeller Foundation. It's also one of the squishiest attributes to\nmeasure, because few organizations have an accurate and consistent view of\ntheir own culture--and even if they do, understanding what attributes\nrepresent a good fit is not straightforward. For example, does the fact that\nan applicant belonged to a fraternity reflect experience working with others\nor elitism or bad attitudes toward women? Should it be completely irrelevant?\nLetting someone with no experience or training make such calls is a recipe for\nbad hires and, of course, discriminatory behavior. Think hard about whether\nyour interviewing protocols make any sense and resist the urge to bring even\nmore managers into the interview process.\n\n### Recognize the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning models.\n\nCulture fit is another area into which new vendors are swarming. Typically\nthey collect data from current employees, create a machine learning model to\npredict the attributes of the best ones, and then use that model to hire\ncandidates with the same attributes.\n\nAs with many other things in this new industry, that sounds good until you\nthink about it; then it becomes replete with problems. Given the best\nperformers of the past, the algorithm will almost certainly include _white_\nand _male_ as key variables. If it's restricted from using that category, it\nwill come up with attributes associated with being a white male, such as\nplaying rugby.\n\nInterviews are where biases most easily show up.\n\nMachine learning models do have the potential to find important but previously\nunconsidered relationships. Psychologists, who have dominated research on\nhiring, have been keen to study attributes relevant to their interests, such\nas personality, rather than asking the broader question \"What identifies a\npotential good hire?\" Their results gloss over the fact that they often have\nonly a trivial ability to predict who will be a good performer, particularly\nwhen many factors are involved. Machine learning, in contrast, can come up\nwith highly predictive factors. Research by Evolv, a workforce analytics\npioneer (now part of Cornerstone OnDemand), found that expected commuting\ndistance for the candidate predicted turnover very well. But that's not a\nquestion the psychological models thought to ask. (And even that question has\nproblems.)\n\nThe advice on selection is straightforward: Test for skills. Ask assessments\nvendors to show evidence that they can actually predict who the good employees\nwill be. Do fewer, more-consistent interviews.\n\n## The Way Forward\n\nIt's impossible to get better at hiring if you can't tell whether the\ncandidates you select become good employees. If you don't know where you're\ngoing, any road will take you there. You must have a way to measure which\nemployees are the best ones.\n\nWhy is that not getting through to companies? Surveyed employers say the main\nreason they don't examine whether their practices lead to better hires is that\nmeasuring employee performance is difficult. Surely this is a prime example of\nmaking the perfect the enemy of the good. Some aspects of performance are not\ndifficult to measure: Do employees quit? Are they absent? Virtually all\nemployers conduct performance appraisals. If you don't trust them, try\nsomething simpler. Ask supervisors, \"Do you regret hiring this individual?\nWould you hire him again?\"\n\nOrganizations that don't check to see how well their practices predict the\nquality of their hires are lacking in one of the most consequential aspects of\nmodern business.\n\n_**Editor 's Note:** A previous version of this article named three\nrecruitment process outsourcing companies, and stated that they utilized\nsubcontractors in India and the Philippines.

The newest development in hiring, which is both promising and\nworrying, is the rise of data science-driven algorithms to find and assess job\ncandidates. By my count, more than 100 vendors are creating and selling these\ntools to companies. Unfortunately, data science--which is still in its infancy\nwhen it comes to recruiting and hiring--is not yet the panacea employers hope\nfor.\n\nVendors of these new tools promise they will help reduce the role that social\nbias plays in hiring. And the algorithms can indeed help identify good job\ncandidates who would previously have been screened out for lack of a certain\neducation or social pedigree. But these tools may also identify and promote\nthe use of predictive variables that are (or should be) troubling.\n\nBecause most data scientists seem to know so little about the context of\nemployment, their tools are often worse than nothing. For instance, an\nastonishing percentage build their models by simply looking at attributes of\nthe \"best performers\" in workplaces and then identifying which job candidates\nhave the same attributes. They use anything that's easy to measure: facial\nexpressions, word choice, comments on social media, and so forth. But a\nfailure to check for any real difference between high-performing and low-\nperforming employees on these attributes limits their usefulness. Furthermore,\nscooping up data from social media or the websites people have visited also\nraises important questions about privacy. True, the information can be\naccessed legally; but the individuals who created the postings didn't intend\nor authorize them to be used for such purposes. Furthermore, is it fair that\nsomething you posted as an undergrad can end up driving your hiring algorithm\na generation later?\n\nAnother problem with machine learning approaches is that few employers collect\nthe large volumes of data--number of hires, performance appraisals, and so on\n--that the algorithms require to make accurate predictions. Although vendors\ncan theoretically overcome that hurdle by aggregating data from many\nemployers, they don't really know whether individual company contexts are so\ndistinct that predictions based on data from the many are inaccurate for the\none.\n\nYet another issue is that all analytic approaches to picking candidates are\nbackward looking, in the sense that they are based on outcomes that have\nalready happened. (Algorithms are especially reliant on past experiences in\npart because building them requires lots and lots of observations--many years'\nworth of job performance data even for a large employer.) As Amazon learned,\nthe past may be very different from the future you seek. It discovered that\nthe hiring algorithm it had been working on since 2014 gave lower scores to\nwomen--even to attributes associated with women, such as participating in\nwomen's studies programs--because historically the best performers in the\ncompany had disproportionately been men. So the algorithm looked for people\njust like them. Unable to fix that problem, the company stopped using the\nalgorithm in 2017. Nonetheless, many other companies are pressing ahead.\n\nThe underlying challenge for data scientists is that hiring is simply not like\ntrying to predict, say, when a ball bearing will fail--a question for which\nany predictive measure might do. Hiring is so consequential that it is\ngoverned not just by legal frameworks but by fundamental notions of fairness.\nThe fact that some criterion is associated with good job performance is\nnecessary but not sufficient for using it in hiring.\n\nTake a variable that data scientists have found to have predictive value:\ncommuting distance to the job. According to the data, people with longer\ncommutes suffer higher rates of attrition. However, commuting distance is\ngoverned by where you live--which is governed by housing prices, relates to\nincome, and also relates to race. Picking whom to hire on the basis of where\nthey live most likely has an adverse impact on protected groups such as racial\nminorities.\n\nUnless no other criterion predicts at least as well as the one being used--and\nthat is extremely difficult to determine in machine learning algorithms--\ncompanies violate the law if they use hiring criteria that have adverse\nimpacts. Even then, to stay on the right side of the law, they must show why\nthe criterion creates good performance. That might be possible in the case of\ncommuting time, but--at least for the moment--it is not for facial\nexpressions, social media postings, or other measures whose significance\ncompanies cannot demonstrate.\n\nIn the end, the drawback to using algorithms is that we're trying to use them\non the cheap: building them by looking only at best performers rather than all\nperformers, using only measures that are easy to gather, and relying on\nvendors' claims that the algorithms work elsewhere rather than observing the\nresults with our own employees. Not only is there no free lunch here, but you\nmight be better off skipping the cheap meal altogether.\n\n* * *\n\n[Peter Cappelli](/search?term=peter+cappelli) is the George W.

As a consequence,\nhiring extraordinary talent is vital to our success and can never be taken for\ngranted. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis we faced a challenge that\nwas, frankly, relatively new to our now 150-year-old firm. For decades\ninvestment banking had been one of the most sought-after, exciting, and fast-\ngrowing industries in the world. That made sense--we were growing by double\ndigits and had high returns, which meant that opportunity and reward were in\ngreat supply. However, the crash took some of the sheen off our industry; both\ngrowth and returns moderated. And simultaneously, the battle for talent\nintensified--within and outside our industry. Many of the candidates we were\npursuing were heading off to Silicon Valley, private equity, or start-ups.\nFurthermore, we were no longer principally looking for a specialized cadre of\naccounting, finance, and economics majors: New skills, especially coding, were\nin huge demand at Goldman Sachs--and pretty much everywhere else. The wind had\nshifted from our backs to our faces, and we needed to respond.\n\nRelated Video\n\n  * [__Save](/video/6026736199001)\n  * [__Share](/video/6026736199001)\n\nNot long ago the firm relied on a narrower set of factors for identifying \"the\nbest\" students, such as school, GPA, major, leadership roles, and relevant\nexperience--the classic resume topics. No longer. We decided to replace our\nhiring playbook with emerging best practices for assessment and recruitment,\nso we put together a task force of senior business leaders, PhDs in industrial\nand organizational psychology, data scientists, and experts in recruiting.\nSome people asked, \"Why overhaul a recruiting process that has proved so\nsuccessful?\" and \"Don't you already have many more qualified applicants than\navailable jobs?\" These were reasonable questions. But often staying successful\nis about learning and changing rather than sticking to the tried-and-true.\n\nEach year we hire up to 3,000 summer interns and nearly as many new analysts\ndirectly from campuses. In our eyes, these are the firm's future leaders, so\nit made sense to focus our initial reforms there. They involved two major\nadditions to our campus recruiting strategy--video interviews and structured\ninterviewing.\n\n### Asynchronous video interviews.\n\nTraditionally we had flown recruiters and business professionals to\nuniversities for first-round interviews. The schools would give us a set date\nand number of time slots to meet with students. That is most definitely not a\nscalable model. It restricted us to a smaller number of campuses and only as\nmany students as we could squeeze into a limited schedule. It also meant that\nwe tended to focus on top-ranked schools. How many qualified candidates were\nat a school became more important than who were the most talented students\nregardless of their school. However, we knew that candidates didn't have to\nattend Harvard, Princeton, or Oxford to excel at Goldman Sachs--our leadership\nranks were already rich with people from other schools. What's more, as we've\nbuilt offices in new cities and geographic locations, we've needed to recruit\nat more schools located in those areas. Video interviews allow us to do that.\n\nAt a time when companies were just beginning to experiment with digital\ninterviewing, we decided to use \"asynchronous\" video interviews--in which\ncandidates record their answers to interview questions--for all first-round\ninteractions with candidates. Our recruiters record standardized questions and\nsend them to students, who have three days to return videos of their answers.\nThis can be done on a computer or a mobile device. Our recruiters and business\nprofessionals review the videos to narrow the pool and then invite the\nselected applicants to a Goldman Sachs office for final-round, in-person\ninterviews. (To create the video platform, we partnered with a company and\nbuilt our own digital solution around its product.)\n\nThis approach has had a meaningful impact in two ways. First, with limited\neffort, we can now spend more time getting to know the people who apply for\njobs at Goldman Sachs. In 2015, the year before we rolled out this platform,\nwe interviewed fewer than 20% of all our campus applicants; in 2018 almost 40%\nof the students who applied to the firm participated in a first-round\ninterview. Second, we now encounter talent from places we previously didn't\nget to. In 2015 we interviewed students from 798 schools around the world,\ncompared with 1,268 for our most recent incoming class. In the United States,\nwhere the majority of our student hires historically came from \"target\nschools,\" the opposite is now true. The top of our recruiting funnel is wider,\nand the output is more diverse.\n\nBeing a people-driven business, we have worked hard to ensure that the video\ninterviews don't feel cold and impersonal. They are only one component of a\nbroader process that makes up the Goldman Sachs recruitment experience. We\nstill regularly send Goldman professionals to campuses to engage directly with\nstudents at informational sessions, \"coffee chats,\" and other recruiting\nevents. But now our goal is much more to share information than to assess\ncandidates, because we want people to understand the firm and what it offers\nbefore they tell us why they want an internship or a job.\n\nOur structured interview questions are designed to assess 10 core\ncompetencies.\n\nWe also want them to be as well prepared as possible for our interview\nprocess. Our goal is a level playing field. To help achieve it, we've created\ntip sheets and instructions on preparing for a video interview. Because the\nplatform doesn't allow videos to be edited once they've been recorded, we\noffer a practice question before the interview begins and a countdown before\nthe questions are asked. We also give students a formal channel for escalating\nissues should technical problems arise, though that rarely occurs.\n\nWe're confident that this approach has created a better experience for\nrecruits. It uses a medium they've grown up with (video), and most important,\nthey can do their interviews when they feel fresh and at a time that works\nwith their schedule. (Our data shows that they prefer Thursday or Sunday night\n--whereas our previous practice was to interview during working hours.) We\nsuspected that if the process was a turnoff for applicants, we would see a dip\nin the percentage who accepted our interviews and our offers. That hasn't\nhappened.\n\n### Structured questioning and assessments.\n\nHow can you create an assessment process that not only helps select top talent\nbut focuses on specific characteristics associated with success? Define it,\nstructure it, and don't deviate from it. Research shows that structured\ninterviews are effective at assessing candidates and helping predict job\nperformance. So we ask candidates about specific experiences they've had that\nare similar to situations they may face at Goldman Sachs (\"Tell me about a\ntime when you were working on a project with someone who was not completing\nhis or her tasks\") and pose hypothetical scenarios they might encounter in the\nfuture (\"In an elevator, you overhear confidential information about a\ncoworker who is also a friend. The friend approaches you and asks if you've\nheard anything negative about him recently. What do you do?\").\n\nEssentially, we are focused less on past achievements and more on\nunderstanding whether a candidate has qualities that will positively affect\nour firm and our culture. Our structured interview questions are designed to\nassess candidates on 10 core competencies, including analytical thinking and\nintegrity, which we know correlate with long-term success at the firm. They\nare evaluated on six competencies in the first round; if they progress,\nthey're assessed on the remaining four during in-person interviews.\n\nWe have a rotating library of questions for each competency, along with a\nrubric for interviewers that explains how to rate responses on a five-point\nscale from \"outstanding\" to \"poor.\" We also train our interviewers to conduct\nstructured interviews, provide them with prep materials immediately before\nthey interview a candidate, and run detailed calibration meetings using all\nthe candidate data we've gathered throughout the recruiting process to ensure\nthat certain interviewers aren't introducing grade inflation (or deflation).\nWe're experimenting with prehire assessment tests to be paired with these\ninterviews; we already offer a technical coding and math exam for applicants\nto our engineering organization.\n\nWe decided not to pilot these changes and instead rolled them out en masse,\nbecause we realized that buy-in would come from being able to show results\nquickly--and because we know that no process is perfect. Indeed, what I love\nmost about our new approach is that we've turned our recruiting department\ninto a laboratory for continuous learning and refinement. With more than\n50,000 candidate video recordings, we're now sitting on a treasure trove of\ndata that will help us conduct insightful analyses and answer questions\nnecessary to run our business: Are we measuring the right competencies? Should\nsome be weighted more heavily than others? What about the candidates'\nbackgrounds? Which interviewers are most effective? Does a top-ranked student\nat a state school create more value for us than an average student from the\nIvy League? We already have indications that students recruited from the new\nschools in our pool perform just as well as students from our traditional ones\n--and in some cases are more likely to stay longer at the firm.\n\nWhat's next for our recruiting efforts? We receive almost 500,000 applications\neach year. From this pool we hire approximately 3%. We believe that many of\nthe other 97% could be very successful at Goldman Sachs. As a result, picking\nthe right 3% is less about just the individual and increasingly about matching\nthe right person to the right role. That match may be made straight out of\ncollege or years later. We're experimenting with resume-reading algorithms\nthat will help candidates identify the business departments best suited to\ntheir skills and interests. We're looking at how virtual reality might help us\nbetter educate students about working in our offices and in our industry. And\nwe're evaluating various tools and tests to bring even more data into the\nhiring decision process. Can I imagine a future in which companies rely\nexclusively on machines and algorithms to rate resumes and interviews? Maybe,\nfor some. But I don't see us ever eliminating the human element at Goldman\nSachs; it's too deeply embedded in our culture, in the work we do, and in what\nwe believe drives success.\n\nI'm excited to see where this journey takes us. Our 2019 campus class is\nshaping up to be the most diverse ever--and it's composed entirely of people\nwho were selected through rigorous, objective assessments. There's no way we\naren't better off as a result.\n\n* * *\n\n[Dane E.

Read the edited\nexcerpts here.\n\n### How do you create a common culture in Novartis, an organization which is\nspread across the globe?\n\nThe importance of culture can never be undermined especially for a pharma\norganization like ours that is at the forefront of innovating medicines to\nmeet unmet medical needs of patients worldwide. Drug development takes a\ncollective effort. It is, therefore, imperative that we have a common culture\nacross all our functions, divisions and geographies that binds people together\nand drives them towards our common objective of developing breakthrough\ntreatments. Our cultural aspiration for everybody at Novartis is to be\nInspired, Curious and Unbossed.\n\nWe follow a three-pronged strategy to bring cultural aspiration to life. The\nfirst is shaping the organizational structures for effectiveness, efficiency,\nand agility and to reduce multiple layers and bring in more simplicity in the\nprocesses. Second is to hire, train and retain high quality, diverse talent\ncapabilities that meet the demands of today and future. The third is to align\nthe individual\u2019s objectives with that of the organization\u2019s because we\nstrongly believe that personal transformation alone can lead to organizational\ntransformation.\n\n### What have been your core people strategy drivers?\n\nOur strategy is based on two key pillars. One is People and Culture: Build a\nsingle consistent Novartis employee experience. We believe in creating and\npromoting #OneNovartis culture. We want to have an inclusive culture that\nleverages the diverse strengths that our associates bring across different\nteams and geographies.\n\nThe second is more focused on the business - Organization and Talent. The\nbusiness landscape evolves with the market. As HR, we need to have the\nforesight to prepare a workforce that is future-ready. We need to have an\norganizational structure, operating model and workflow that can adapt to the\nrapid changes. We have made sure that all our divisions are more integrated\nand not operating in silos. As the business model evolves - we have to make\nsure that we are hiring people with the right mindset and capability.\n\n### How can HR bring new value to the business in times of disruption?\n\nThe operating models of pharma are constantly evolving. HR has a crucial role\nto play in these disruptive times. We need to have the right organization\nmodel, capabilities and culture that enables science-based innovations and\ndelivers positive outcomes. Creating an organizational structure is essential\nwhich is extremely agile.\n\nIn addition, keeping in mind the emerging need for personalized medicine, we\nneed to enable our associates to understand and embrace these disruptive\ntechnologies. HR plays an important role in defining the talent strategy to\nsupport long-term strategic business objectives based on future organizational\ntalent needs and the dynamics of the external talent market.\n\n### What steps is Novartis taking to build an environment that supports\ncreativity, collaboration, the performance of their associates?\n\nTo build a creative, collaborative and high performing organization, there are\na few levers one must keep in mind. One is definitely culture- we want our\nassociates to be inspired, curious and unbossed. And as I had mentioned\nearlier, in order to encourage continuous learning and enable our associates\nto stay ahead of the scientific advances being made across various fields, we\nhave invested in platforms like LinkedIn Learning and Coursera so that our\npeople can have all the learning opportunities they want at their fingertips.\n\nWe reimagined our performance management system wherein we said that we do not\nwant our people to focus on individual objectives in silos, but we really want\nthem to move towards a collective objective. We encourage our people to be\nmore collaborative and work together towards our common goal of improving and\nextending patients\u2019 lives. As HR, we are making sure that the kind of people\nwe are hiring in the organization are more aligned with the new culture that\nwe are trying to inculcate.\n\n### What are your key focus areas for the financial year 2019-20?\n\nOur culture aspiration will also continue to be our focus in 2019-20. We aim\nto ensure that everybody at Novartis knows, applies, experiences and sustains\nour culture in their daily activities.\n\nTo ignite this cultural transformation, we have started our efforts with our\nleaders. There is a strong correlation between the levels of active engagement\nin culture change by leaders and the willingness of associates to make a\npersonal change. We want to develop leaders who are self-aware and be aligned\nwith our cultural values and principles so that they act as role models for\nour associates.\n\nSecondly, we want to activate teams and engage associates by creating\nawareness about our cultural values. Every quarter we are conducting a survey\n\u2013 \u2018Our Voice\u2019 to hear from our associates on what is working and what is not.\nWe want to empower them to \u2018fix one thing\u2019 that could lead us closer to our\ncultural evolution.\n\nThirdly, we want to improve experiences. Our reimagined performance management\nsystem is designed to help us move from individual goals to team-based ones,\nenable spontaneous robust feedback \u2013 with the principle from \u201canyone, any\ntime\u201d, while building a strong coaching culture. We want our associates at all\nlevels to be the catalyst for change in this year and beyond.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [Culture](/category/organizational-\nculture/culture?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=culture \"Browse more in:\nCulture\"), [#Work &\nSkills](/tag/workskills?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=workskills \"Browse\nmore in: Work &amp; Skills\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Abid Hasan](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1532684192/authors/abid-\nhasan.jpg)](/author/abid-hasan)\n\n#### [Abid Hasan](/author/abid-hasan)\n\nAbid is working as an Associate-Editor with People Matters.

Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n### Lim Teck Yong, _Shopee 's Head of Regional Operations and People Team,\nspeaks to Priya Sunil on the online marketplace's competency-based, systematic\nand holistic approach towards leadership development for both new and\nexperienced leaders._\n\nWith Southeast Asia becoming the hotspot for many eCommerce and tech ventures,\none of the most pressing challenges for most companies is the talent gap, says\nLim Teck Yong, Head of Regional Operations and People Team at Shopee.\n\nHence, the online shopping platform believes in grooming its leaders from\nwithin. According to Lim, while many of Shopee's young leaders are\n\"exceptional in their own domain\", they are also first-time managers who have\nfaced steep learning curves.\n\nHe says: \"Even for experienced managers who have led teams before, our rapid\ngrowth means that they have had to adapt and manage bigger teams.\"\n\nThe solution? A competency-based, systematic and holistic approach towards\nleadership development, shares Lim. This approach integrates programmes for\nnew and aspiring managers to align on practices of developing high-performing\nteams, as well as tailored programmes for five levels of leadership\nexperience.\n\nAdditional programmes and resources are also available, which include coaching\nand mentoring programmes; organisation-wide feedback tools to identify\nleadership development needs; regular sharing sessions by senior leaders; and\ndedicated in-house leadership trainers and training partners.\n\n\"Our approach necessitates heavy involvement from top management.\"\n\n> ##### Together, with the dedication of our talented professionals within the\n> learning and development team, we are able to build a learning culture.\n\nTo facilitate this culture, the company's Shopee Academy provides foundational\nmodules that introduce first-time leaders to leadership, as well as more\nadvanced modules for experienced leaders.\n\nThe first step into Shopee's learning and development modules takes place\nthrough an intensive regional onboarding programme for managers, where\nexperiential activities highlight the importance of the leadership culture and\ncompetencies. These managers also attend deep-dive sessions to improve their\nunderstanding of Shopee's key business functions. Over 350 leaders have been\ninvolved in this programme since its inception in 2018.\n\nSecond, the academy offers five tiers of leadership development programmes\ndesigned to meet the needs of Shopee's leaders at different stages. Every\nleader in the organisation is invited to participate in the tailored, two-day\ntraining programmes each year.\n\nThe range of programmes include leadership masterclasses (conducted\nexternally); two-hour training courses; brown-bag sessions by senior leaders;\npanel discussions; learning networking sessions; and subsidies for online or\nexternal training.\n\nWithin the first quarter of 2019, more than 450 leaders across the region have\nparticipated in these programmes.\n\nIn addition to the above, Shopee also chose to integrate its current coaching\nprogramme with its leadership programme so as to ensure continuity in its\nstaff learning while emphasising on the application of learning.\n\nLike in every implementation, the team at Shopee has faced some challenges\nalong the way in implementing this gamut of programmes. Lim explains: \"One of\nour challenges in implementing our coaching and mentoring programmes was the\nlimited numbers of coaches and mentors we had, in relation to the number of\nemployees interested in the programmes.\"\n\nIn fact, he admits that the mentoring programme is widely popular, with more\nthan 100 mentors and 300 mentees benefitting from the programme.\n\nTo address this, he shares: \"We learned that senior management support, role-\nmodelling from senior leaders, sharing of success stories, and proper training\nby Shopee's learning and development team, helped to motivate coaches and\nmentors in investing their time and effort.\"\n\n\"Many have commented that they have learnt a lot through the programmes\nthemselves!\"\n\n### Looking towards 2020: What\u2019s on the agenda?\n\nCurrently, Lim believes there is a shortage of talent, especially leaders with\nspecialised tech experience and skills suitable for the eCommerce industry.\n\nFurther, he says: \"Transitioning from tech professionals to leadership\npositions can be rather challenging.\n\n\"Therefore, a formalised, progressive development programme for tech leaders\ncould focus on building critical tech leadership skills, based on the specific\nchallenges faced within tech teams.\"![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/08/22105026/Screenshot-2019-08-22-at-10.49.17-700x446.png)\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n_This case study was part of a feature on leadership development, which\nappeared in the June-July edition of[Human Resources magazine\n(Singapore)](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/).

Why?  Numerous studies show companies offering growth and\ndevelopment opportunities translates to high success in recruitment and\nretention.  TM itself is a commitment from an organization to recruit, hire,\nretain, and develop employees.\n\nIn the guide below, the HR Exchange Network explores the topic in more detail.\nIt takes a look the current state of affairs, strategies, why you should\ninvest in TM and even a forecast into what to expect in the coming years.\n\n# Talent Management - What is it?\n\nJohn Hopkins University defines TM as, \"a set of integrated organizational HR\nprocesses designed to attract, develop, motivate, and retain productive,\nengaged employees.\"  In simpler terms, it's finding the right people for the\nright jobs to achieve the strategic goals set forth by leadership.\n\nAs a strategy, TM is not wholly owned by the HR department.  In fact, it\nrequires HR professionals to work with managers/supervisors within the\ncompany's ranks to put the strategy into action.  That's a bit different when\ncontrasted with strategies such as [human capital\nmanagement](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/articles/human-capital-management-our-role-our-emerging-\nresponsibilities) or a [performance management\nstrategy](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/videos/performance-management-an-interview-with-fannie-mae-vp-\ndavid-theis).  Under those strategies, there is more reliance on HR than the\nmanagers.\n\n## **Talent Management Pillars**\n\nA solid TM strategy will address four critical areas.  These are often\nreferred to as the Four Pillars of TM.\n\n  1. Recruitment\n  2. Performance Management\n  3. Learning and Development\n  4. Retention\n\n#### Why the Learning Culture Drives Business Success\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/hr_exchange_network_why_the_learning_culture_drives_business_success2.jpg)\n\nOur Annual Report addresses how to manage a multigenerational workforce and\nhow to increase experiential and reflective learning opportunities, and\nintroduce a variety of training modalities to enhance the current learning\nprogram.\n\n[Learn More](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/learning/reports/why-the-\nlearning-culture-drives-business-\nsuccess/?utm_source=HRIQ_Inline%20Ad&utm_medium=Portal&utm_campaign=Why%20the%20Learning%20Culture%20Drives%20Business%20Success_Talent%20Management%20Guide&utm_term=&utm_content=&disc=&extTreatId=7423117)\n\n### Pillars Explained\n\nTo better understand each pillar, a description of each is below.\n\n_Recruitment_ - In order for a talent management strategy to exist, there must\nfirst be talent.  Recruitment is Step 1 in creating the strategy.  Here,\ncompanies and organizations work to attract talented people who can be\nconverted in to employees.\n\n_Performance Management_ - Once hired, talent is expected to perform at a high\nstandard.  This process includes the way in which HR measures and improves\nperformance.  Common procedures include performance reviews, one-on-one\nmeetings, and reward and recognition programs.\n\n_Learning and Development_ - This pillar includes everything from ongoing\ntraining to learning during the employee lifecycle.  It allows for workers to\nfine-tune and further develop the critical skills needed to meet their\nperformance goals and to help the company complete its strategic goals.\n\n_Retention_ - As defined, retention is about keeping high performing talent\nwith the company or organization as long as possible.  This leads to increased\nproductivity and successful completion of strategic goals.\n\n## **What HR Professionals have to say about TM**\n\nTo understand more about TM, here are a few quotes from HR professionals on\nthe topic and associated issues.\n\nFernando Sanchez Arias, the HR Director for Learning and Development at The\nHome Depot says, \"We need to attract the best talent, help them to learn, help\nthem to feel engaged and, of course, to ensure that they can perform and\nproduce the results that the customers are expecting them to deliver.\"\n\nDr. Uzma Burki, the Senior Global Head and Deputy Director for Total Rewards\nand Global Mobility Strategy for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation says,\n\"Whether they are regional, national or international, companies have to look\nat how they attract, retain and develop these different talent centers. What\ntypes of benefits and rewards would appeal to these people? We have to start\nthinking of an a la carte, rather than standard, menu of compensation and\nbenefits.\"\n\nPeter Cappelli, the director of HR for The Wharton School says, \"The talent\nproblems of employers, employees, and the broader society are intertwined.\nEmployers want the skills they need when they need them, delivered in a manner\nthey can afford. Employees want prospects for advancement and control over\ntheir careers.\"\n\n## Why you should invest in TM\n\nTo understand more about the current state of TM, consider the following data\nfrom the HR Exchange Network.\n\nAccording to surveys conducted by the HR Exchange Network, TM-related\ninitiatives seem to be getting a significant amount of attention.  When asked\nwhat specific initiatives were being put into place, the majority of HR\nprofessionals focus on performance management, leadership and development, and\nrecruitment and onboarding.\n\n![talent\nmanagement_1_survey](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/tm_1_survey.png)\n\n## Why is it important to invest in TM?\n\nFirstly, it helps attract the ideal candidates to the company.  If hired,\nthose new employees help improve business performance.  It also increases\nemployee motivation meaning employees are more likely to complete their tasks\nand stay with the company.  By retaining these employees, the company saves on\nrecruitment and performance management costs down the road.  It also increases\nemployee engagement.  With a strong TM strategy in place, employees see more\nopportunities to develop.  Again, this leads to higher retention rates and\nbusiness performance.\n\n**[Transformation of Talent Management\n](//www.slideshare.net/MasonStevenson1/transformation-of-talent-\nmanagement-92094352 \"Transformation of Talent Management \") ** from **[Mason\nStevenson](https://www.slideshare.net/MasonStevenson1)**\n\nAs a result, every function that falls under TM is seeing increasing amounts\nof tech disruption.  There are more and more technology solutions for\neverything from recruitment to engagement. Massive investments are happening\nin intelligent assessment and moving toward more AI-based technologies in\nrecruitment and automation. This means modernization should be a top priority\nfor all HR departments. In other words, it's either sink or swim.\n\n> REPORT DOWNLOAD:  [HR Tech Global Report\n> 2019](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-tech/reports/hr-tech-global-\n> report-2019)\n\n## **Best Practices**\n\nTo understand more about TM, here are some of the best practices to follow.\n\n### Recruitment\n\n![talent management chelle\nokeefe](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/chelle_o_keefe_recruiting.png)\n\nRecruitment offers both a challenge and an opportunity: finding talent that\nfits the company culture and can contribute to the company.  Having said that,\nhow do HR professionals accomplish the goal?  Associa chief human resources\nofficer Chelle O'Keefe says HR professionals must, \"Think like a marketer as\nyou're considering this idea of strategic recruiting.\"\n\n  1. Improve the candidate pool\n  2. Consider internal candidates\n  3. Strengthen the employee brand\n  4. Involve current employees\n  5. Offer the best pay and best benefits\n  6. Check references\n\n### Succession planning\n\nThe current talent environment is one most HR professionals have not seen\nbefore.  There are more jobs than there are skilled people to fill those\npositions.  And it's forecasted to get worse before it gets better.  Between\n2017 and 2027, a talent shortage of 8.2 million US workers could exist\naccording to Manpower.\n\nThat makes [succession planning](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/podcasts/pain-free-succession-planning) all the more important for\nthe HR professionals doing their best to minimize the impact on their\nrespective companies.  The problem is succession planning is not always seen\nas paramount strategy.\n\nIn an HR Exchange Network survey, we asked respondents this question:  does\nyour company have a formal succession planning strategy that focuses on long-\nterm goals, hiring, and talent retention?  The results were split right down\nthe middle.\n\n![talent management survey\n2](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/talent_management_survey_2.png)\n\nSo, what makes up a critical succession planning strategy?\n\nFirst, HR must understand the organizational goals of the business over the\nnext 6 months.  They must also understand goals for one, two and five years.\nThis is important because HR needs to be able to assess the skill set of the\ncurrent workforce and then define what skills they need moving forward.  This\nis critical when looking at and planning for talent development.\n\n![talent management larry\nbrand](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/larry_brand_on_sp.png)\n\nIt's not just about understanding the business goals of their respective\ncompanies, HR must be able to understand and follow current and future trends\nof their company's industry.  Again, this is key to defining the skills needed\nfor succession candidates.\n\nThe second component is an assessment of employee engagement.  It goes without\nsaying an engaged employee is a much more productive employee.  The engaged\nemployee also makes for a stronger succession candidate and overall critical\nsuccession planning strategy.\n\nFinally, HR must be able to assess their current hiring strategies,\nspecifically those related to filling an open leadership position.  External\nhiring can be a lengthy process.  It is certainly a costly one.  A succession\nplanning strategy can wipe out the lengthy process and can cut back on costs.\n\n\"Succession planning is a process every company needs to have to make sure\nthey know where the gaps are, they know what talent they have in place and how\nto develop them in the upcoming years until the position is ready,\" Larry\nBrand said.  He's the chief human resources officer for Elkay Manufacturing.\n\n### Career Pathing\n\n[Career pathing](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/articles/hrs-role-in-employee-career-pathing) is that process by\nwhich the employee and, usually, the employer chart a path toward the\nemployee's future development goals. The destination, as well as the steps,\nexperience, and development needed to get there are included.\n\nThe challenge for HR professionals is knowing what knowledge, skills, personal\ncharacteristics, and experience are needed to reach the intended goal. For the\nemployee, the challenge is about examining whether or not the employee\npossesses the qualities deemed necessary for the job they wish to pursue.\n\nEmployees want to see and understand the opportunities available within their\ncompany. They expect to see career development opportunities while being\nsatisfied and motivated. As a result, career pathing is an important factor in\nother strategies including employee engagement and employee retention. It also\nprovides companies with the opportunity to differentiate itself from\ncompetitors.\n\n## The Future of TM\n\nThe future of TM centers on modernization.  Those companies and organizations\nthat don't modernize should expect to get left behind.\n\nGone are the days of 30 year careers in one organization\u2026 where employees\nstarted at the bottom of the personnel ladder and tried to work their way up.\nIn fact, most new entries into the workforce are likely to change jobs every\nthree to five years and hold 12+ jobs in five to six different companies.\nFurthermore, these individuals will change professions two to three times and,\nin the process, will be working for a very long time.\n\nSo, what's the reason for this development?\n\nSimply, workers are living longer, healthier lives and choose to continue\nworking for a variety of reasons.  It's been said before that Baby Boomers are\nretiring, and while that's true, it isn't happening at the rate first thought.\n\nOne of those reasons focuses on the continuing technology disruption.  Simply,\ntechnology creates this concept of the half- life skill.  Essentially, the\nhalf-life of a learned skill is 5 years. That means much of what a worker\nlearned 10 years ago is now obsolete and half of what the worker learned five\nyears ago is irrelevant.\n\nMix that with what some say is a volatile business environment and it\ntranslates to workers' necessity to change jobs.  In doing so, they must be\nprepared for the new future of work.\n\n### Rethinking TM\n\nHR must find ways to source new talent by specifically looking at the open\nglobal talent economy.  This allows HR to find talent anywhere in a variety of\nformats.\n\nNext, companies should focus on the learning and development aspect.\n\nWorkers want to continue to learn, so companies must offer platforms that\ncreate an environment of continuous, ongoing learning with new opportunities\nto learn and grow and contribute to the organization.\n\nFinally, companies need their TM strategies to be more nimble.\n\nTalent practices need to be reinvented and converted into an ecosystem that\nhelps with rapid deployment and development of talent by using agile processes\nand systems that help HR to respond to talent.\n\n#### Why the Learning Culture Drives Business Success\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/hr_exchange_network_why_the_learning_culture_drives_business_success2.jpg)\n\nOur Annual Report addresses how to manage a multigenerational workforce and\nhow to increase experiential and reflective learning opportunities, and\nintroduce a variety of training modalities to enhance the current learning\nprogram.\n\n[Learn More](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/learning/reports/why-the-\nlearning-culture-drives-business-\nsuccess/?utm_source=HRIQ_Inline%20Ad&utm_medium=Portal&utm_campaign=Why%20the%20Learning%20Culture%20Drives%20Business%20Success_Talent%20Management%20Guide&utm_term=&utm_content=&disc=&extTreatId=7423117)\n\n## **In Summation**\n\nMove the company forward.  That's the mission of every TM strategy when it\nalso serves as the next big business strategy.  HR and managers place a\npremium on talent who add to the business and who support and reinforce the\ncompany.  That, in turn, becomes a vital part of what a business stands for.\n\n##  More From HR Guides [ __](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/content-\nhub/hr-guides)\n\n[\n\n##### Diversity and Inclusion: HR\u2019s Guide to a Successful Strategy\n\n](/hr-talent-management/articles/diversity-inclusion-hrs-guide-to-a-\nsuccessful-strategy)\n\nMore and more emphasis is being put on diversity and inclusion in today\u2019s\nworld, but what does that...\n\n__ 2020-02-28 _by  [HR Exchange Network Editorial\nTeam](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/contributor/hr-exchange-network-\neditorial-team)_\n\n[\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/dandi_guide_businesswomen_and_businessmen_attending_group_meeting_conference_in_office_room.jpg)\n](/hr-talent-management/articles/diversity-inclusion-hrs-guide-to-a-\nsuccessful-strategy)\n\n* * *\n\n[\n\n##### Workplace Culture: HR\u2019s Guide to Implementation\n\n](/employee-engagement/articles/workplace-culture-hrs-guide-to-implementation)\n\nThe workplace culture is undergoing its most significant transformation ever.\nWhat the changes look...\n\n__ 2019-12-30 _by  [Mason\nStevenson](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/contributor/mason-stevenson)_\n\n[\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/workplace_culture__hr___s_guide_to_implementation_people-\nmeeting-workspace-team.jpg) ](/employee-engagement/articles/workplace-culture-\nhrs-guide-to-implementation)\n\n* * *\n\n[\n\n##### Employee Engagement: Everything You Need to Know\n\n](/employee-engagement/articles/employee-engagement-everything-you-need-to-\nknow)\n\nEmployee engagement is more than just employees bring their \u201cbest selves\u201d to\nwork.

We continue to struggle to\nfind and keep CofE professionals who can deliver truly innovative, commercial\nand flexible approaches that are relevant for today\u2019s world. And those of us\nwho have spent time in outsourcing, shared service hell are beginning to get\nnostalgic about the days when it was all in-house.\n\nMoreover, the demands of our clients increase daily. There doesn\u2019t seem to be\nany C-suite executive who hasn\u2019t read about how other companies are getting\nrid of appraisals and are questioning what we are doing about it. Those pesky\nMillennials won\u2019t stop making demands for greater flexibility and wanting\neverything on their Smartphone. And just when we thought our budget might\nincrease for the first time in a few years, the FD\u2019s begging bowl has\nreappeared.\n\nMore for less. Greater productivity. More innovation. All HR professionals\nface the same challenges, regardless of sector.\n\nOf course, focusing on the future HR organisation structure is a bit of a\n\u201cphysician heal thyself\u201d scenario. For, as we would urge our clients not to\nleap to the org chart, so we need to ask some fairly fundamental questions\nabout what we do and how we do it if we are going to actually deliver more\nproductivity and innovation. But, I have been asked to give my thoughts on the\nHR org structure that can meet the demands of a modern world so that\u2019s what\nthis blog aims to do. If you are interested in hearing about them in more\ndepth then [check out our free webinar](http://disruptivehr.com/our-\nproducts/webinars/).\n\nDescribing an organisation structure that would work for any type of company\nwould be fairly meaningless, so instead I am going to focus on 5 key trends in\nHR design that we\u2019re seeing that will offer greater opportunities for real\ncreativity, increased capacity to deliver and happily, should save money too.\n\n**The 5 trends in HR org design**\n\n  1. **From Business Partner to Account Management**\n\nWhen looking for a new HRBP, I was often tempted to advertise for a Super Hero\nwith strong interpersonal skills. _\u201cWe need a strategic and commercial HR\nbusiness partner. They must have experience in the full range of HR elements,\nbe a coach, a law enforcer, a spoon-feeder, a tear-drier and the conscience of\nthe business. They must be prepared to come up with lots of new ideas, only to\nhave them ignored, take the blame when things go wrong, and always to have\ntheir item put last on any team meeting agenda, after finance, operations,\nmarketing, IT and problems with the toilets. They must be relentlessly\ncheerful and be prepared to listen to the ravings or woes of anyone who seeks\nthem out. Above all, they must be able to present the latest Group-wide HR\ninitiative that has absolutely no relevance to their business unit, to their\nMD as if it\u2019s the best thing since sliced bread.\u201d_ When you look at what we\nwant from them, it\u2019s amazing to me that we can find one, let alone the numbers\nthat most HR structures depend upon.\n\nEstimates vary but it was seen that typically between 20-30% of traditional HR\nadvisers would be unlikely to make the step up to full HR Business Partner. In\nmy experience, it was significantly higher than that and most companies can\ncount on one hand the number of HRBPs that can fulfil all that is required.\nGiven this resource is both scarce and expensive, we are seeing a move to\nreducing the number of them and moving towards more of an account management\nrole. This person does the strategic and commercial parts of the role, the\nrelationship building, the diagnosis of what\u2019s required, the resource planning\nand the oversight of the delivery. They then call upon a pool of HR\ngeneralists and/or technical experts who can deliver. The key benefits of this\napproach are a reliance on a fewer number of HR generalists, a genuine\nstrategic/commercial focus from HR and the deployment of non-partisan\ngeneralists who can go to the greatest point of need.\n\n**2\\. HR Advisory \u2013 More than a Transaction**\n\nAll of us who bear the scars from outsourcing our well-loved and local HR\nadvisers have learned some hard lessons. We have come to realise that seeing\nHR advisory as a transactional service that can cost less by simply lobbing it\nover the organisation fence to an outsourced provider who offers ruthlessly\nefficient processes has some major flaws. Our HR processes are rarely\nbeautifully streamlined at the point of transfer and so we import significant\nadditional costs as the provider tries to navigate all of the \u201cspecial and\ndifferent\u201d approaches we have historically accommodated. We ignored the loss\nof institutional memory as we marched these advisers out of the door. But most\ncritically, we forgot the fact that when a line manager is asking about a\nparticular policy \u2013 they are _not actually asking about a policy_ \u2013 but how to\nget round it! The in-house HR adviser knew their line managers and their\nemployees and deployed a big chunk of judgement along with their advice. They\nwould weigh up the maturity of the line manager, the precedents that had\nalready been set, the risks with this particular employee, etc, etc. The\npainful outsourcing experiences of recent years have led some organisations to\ntake this service back in-house. But we are also seeing a new trend \u2013 of next\ngeneration outsourced providers who are fundamentally different. One example\nof this is [Adviser Plus](http://www.adviserplus.com/) who have built in an\nintrinsic understanding of the value and risks of HR advisory into their\nservice \u2013 for example, providing a proactive phone call to a manager who is\ndownloading a policy document that can be more high risk if they get it wrong,\nsuch as redundancy policy \u2013 and seeing if they want to talk anything through.\nHR advisory will continue to offer significant opportunities for outsourcing \u2013\nbut with a new style of approach that involves empathy, understanding,\ncapability development and the ability to assess risk.\n\n**3\\. Employee Experience not Centres of Expertise**\n\nThe approach we take in The Disruptive HR Agency is based upon our unique EACH\nmodel \u2013 Employees as Adults, Consumers and Human beings. We therefore really\nwelcome the next key trend \u2013 to cluster Centres of Expertise around a focus on\nthe employee experience - as it supports and reinforces one of these elements\n\u2013 the employee as a consumer. One of the (occasionally legitimate) accusations\nthat is levelled at the CofE teams is that they are too focused on their own\ndiscipline and producing the perfect recruitment, talent, development,\ndiversity, performance management, reward (delete as appropriate) solution and\nfail to connect to the needs of the business. In the same way that many\nconsumer organisations have grouped many of their functions around a Head of\nCustomer Experience, so this is starting to be adopted by HR for their people.\n\nThis is more than just a change of job title. By re-focusing on the actual\nexperience that is desired at each stage of the employee life cycle,\norganisations can create a more joined up and holistic employee proposition\nthat is greater than the sum of its HR parts. Driven by improved and genuine\nemployee insight (not just an annual engagement survey but a blend of\nqualitative and quantitative analysis), created through effective user-centred\ndesign and delivered in ways that are relevant to each segment of their\nemployee \u201cmarket\u201d \u2013 there are huge opportunities to increase cut through and\nreduce wasted effort.\n\n**4\\. Building capability not just compliance**\n\nThis trend comes largely through a fresh response to a disrupted world where\nthe abundance of employment policies and rules often stifle innovation and\nincrease frustration of employees. The role of HR as The Enforcer is not what\nmany of us who went into this profession wanted but is one we have continued\nto play. Of course rules matter. But any of us who have had to draft\ninterminable employment policies recognise that this comes at a cost \u2013 to our\ncapacity to focus on building the capabilities of line managers. I am often\nbrought in to provide fresh challenge and ideas for HR teams. Whilst they like\nthe innovation, they equally are concerned about their ability to deliver as\ntheir managers \u201cwouldn\u2019t do it\u201d. They may be right but this means we are stuck\nin this vicious cycle where - we don\u2019t trust managers to manage - we therefore\nproduce rules and processes that make them do it - we spend our time enforcing\nand monitoring the process to make sure they have \u2013 which means we don\u2019t have\nthe time to develop their capability \u2013 so we don\u2019t trust them to manage \u2013 and\nso on \u2026.\n\nMoreover, our seeming reluctance to let go of the role of Compliance Officer\nseriously dents our HR brand. If we spend our time ensuring cost efficiency\nand operational compliance \u2013 then why should we be taken seriously when we\nstart to talk about value creation? I know it is hard to see a way out \u2013 I\nhave tried and failed often, but only when we release ourselves from the\ncompliance burden and focus instead on building judgement, insight and space\nfor creativity will we be able to break the cycle. The Netflix HR team\u2019s\ndetermination to steer clear of the role of HR police is well documented, but\nwe are starting to see this as a trend in HR and not just a one-off.\nInterestingly, it is gaining traction in sectors that are often perceived as\nless innovative \u2013 the public and not-for-profit sectors. The continual cuts in\nsupport functions has forced them to consider a more radical alternative than\nsome of their commercial and less cash strapped cousins. I know of examples in\nthe Housing, FE and Local Government areas where they are having to focus on\nrolling back HR\u2019s role in compliance \u2013 with highly productive results.\n\n**5\\. Contingent vs Permanent**\n\nThis final trend has been evident in piecemeal form for many years. We have\nregularly deployed contractors, temps, and consultants to supplement or\nenhance our FTE levels. But we have rarely used them as a strategic choice \u2013\nmore as a tactical fill in. The accelerated pace of innovation in the HR\nspace, the continued pressure on costs and the need to deploy rapidly to\nresolve issues or bring about change all lead you to question whether a\nstanding army of HR people is relevant in the future. This trend is about\n\u201cSmart Contingency\u201d \u2013 a belief that you can get a better level of innovation,\na better resource flow and increased delivery capability if you include non-\npermanent resources as a key part of your HR team. This is more than getting\nin additional bodies to fix a problem or to cover maternity leave, it\u2019s more\nthan buying a consultant to give specialist advice \u2013 it is about building an\neco-system of a mix of contingent HR capabilities that meet your medium and\nlonger term needs. Contemporary HR org structures are building up their\nabilities to commission work and to contract effectively to get the most from\nthis growing resource.\n\n**But you haven\u2019t mentioned digital?!**\n\nI do realise that not mentioning digital in an HR blog about the future is\nlikely to get me chucked out of HR club (not for the first time!) but I have\ndone so intentionally. Digital is a channel, a medium and an underlying\napproach that should permeate everything we do and is not, IMHO (as my\ndaughter puts it) an organisation trend. Of course we may need to create a\nspecific focus on this in the short term to raise its profile and build our\ncapability. But very shortly, it will be simply the means by which we deliver\nour services \u2013 after all we wouldn\u2019t have an Email team or Face to Face team\nwould we?\n\n**Please do let us know your thoughts**\n\nI am sure that many of you will have other and better thoughts than these and\nI would love to hear about them. What are the new trends you are seeing in HR\norg design? What\u2019s working for you?

\"Posts\nby Contributor\")\n\n## The 5 most popular types of office layouts: Which one is yours?\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/). Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\n### Ambient Concept's Charmaine Kon _identifies the different types of office\nlayouts and their functions to see which one works best for your business._\n\nAn effective office layout keeps employee morale high, enables productivity,\nand optimises workflow.\n\nMore than a matter of fitting a certain number of people into the same space,\nyour choice of layout should depend on the type of work, workflow, aesthetics,\namenities, communication, and even the company\u2019s branding.\n\nIf you\u2019re setting up an office, read on to learn about the different types of\noffice layouts and their functions to see which one works best for your\nbusiness.\n\n### **#1 The really open space**\n\n![Priya-November-2018-Office-layouts2-Ambient-Concept-Provided-\nResized](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/14093910/Priya-November-2018-Office-layouts2-Ambient-\nConcept-Provided-Resized.jpg)\n\n\n\nWith the proliferation of startups along with their Gen Y and Gen Z employees,\nopen plan offices are a popular choice. These offices are characterised by\ntheir lack of cubicles and partitions. Desks are arranged in rows or clusters\nin an open area.\n\n**Who it\u2019s for:** Fast paced and flat hierarchy organisations like startups\nand tech companies.\n\n**Advantages:** The lack of barriers between employees enable communication.\nThis means that decisions get made faster, resulting in prompt action and\nincreased work efficiency.\n\nThe open plan office is also more affordable, as there are no partitions or\nrooms to build. This way, natural lighting can stream through the entire\noffice and fewer artificial lighting and air conditioners are needed.\n\n**Common design mistakes:** Not having enough meeting rooms or private pods.\nMany startup offices have vibrant open layouts which are noisy, distracting,\nand lack privacy. While open communications allow for efficient work,\nemployees still need quiet and private booths and rooms to make calls and hold\ndiscussions.\n\n### #2 The private rooms\n\n![Priya-November-2018-Office-layouts3-Ambient-Concept-Provided-\nResized](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/14093914/Priya-November-2018-Office-layouts3-Ambient-\nConcept-Provided-Resized.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Who it\u2019s for:** People who do confidential work or who have frequent one-on-\none meetings with clients like legal firms and healthcare professionals.\n\n**Advantages:** Employees have their own rooms which they can arrange,\ndecorate, and furnish according to their professional and personal needs.\nPrivacy, quietness, and focus are the main advantages of such workspaces.\n\n**Common design mistakes:** Private rooms see employees working in isolation.\nAs such, meeting rooms, pantries, and halls should be added to enable\ncollaboration and interaction. Additionally, pantries and hallways should have\ninviting designs where people can hold casual conversations, have coffee\nbreaks, and exchange ideas with colleagues or even clients.\n\n### **#3 The case for cubicles**\n\n![Priya-November-2018-Office-layouts4-Ambient-Concept-Provided-\nResized](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/14093919/Priya-November-2018-Office-layouts4-Ambient-\nConcept-Provided-Resized.jpg)\n\n\n\nAnother common office design is desks that are designated within cubicles.\nThese can come in quads where cubicles are arranged in a two by two layout, or\nrow design where cubicles are arranged horizontally across the room.\n\n**Who it\u2019s for:** Big organisations with individuals or teams who require some\nprivacy like banks, telemarketing companies, and auditing firms.\n\n**Advantages:** On the privacy-collaboration spectrum, cubicles are a good\nmiddle ground. They enable quick and open communication while offering privacy\nand mitigating distraction for focused work, phone calls, and sensitive\ndocuments.\n\n**Common design mistakes:** Avoid arbitrary seating arrangements. For example,\na company might place all its operations teams on one floor and sales teams on\nanother. While this makes sense in an organisation chart, it inhibits\nworkflow. For example, client managers from the operations team need to work\nclosely with the sales team, so it\u2019s best to arrange seating according to\nworkflow. Fitting too many cubicles into a small space is another common\ndesign error. It results in narrow walkways, a noisy environment, and clutter.\n\n### #4 The team clusters\n\n![Priya-November-2018-Office-layouts5-Ambient-Concept-Provided-\nResized](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/14093923/Priya-November-2018-Office-layouts5-Ambient-\nConcept-Provided-Resized.jpg)\n\n\n\nWith cubicles or not, the basis of the team-based office layout is grouping\nteams into clusters and designated zones in the office to ease communication\nand workflow.\n\n**Who it\u2019s for:** Organisations with multiple teams that have very different\nroles, or teams that hold a lot of internal discussions. Examples: advertising\nagencies and corporate companies.\n\n**Advantages:** Enables communications within teams while people with similar\nroles and work needs get to use the same space.\n\n**Common design mistakes:** Neglecting the importance of having meeting rooms\nand private booths on the assumption that the people who need to work together\nalready sit together. Dedicated spaces for grouping like meeting rooms and\ndining areas are important to foster communication and boost social\ninteraction between employees.\n\n### **#5 The co-working space**\n\n![Priya-November-2018-Office-layouts6-Ambient-Concept-Provided-\nResized](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/14093928/Priya-November-2018-Office-layouts6-Ambient-\nConcept-Provided-Resized.jpg)\n\n\n\nCo-working spaces are third-party office providers who offer a range of\nworkspaces for individuals and organisations. These include individual desk\nrentals, office suites, and even whole office floors for larger companies.\n\n**Who it\u2019s for:** Freelancers, startups, small companies without office\ncapital, and large companies who enjoy state-of-the-art facilities.\n\n**Advantages:** The best facilities such as premium printers which are\nmaintained by the co-working space providers, well-equipped rest areas, and a\nnever-ending supply of refreshments. As co-working spaces cater to\nindividuals, small groups, and even large companies, they usually have a wide\nrange of workspaces for different working styles and functions. These include\nphone booths, small meeting rooms, event halls, office suites, and more.\n\n**Common design mistakes:** Inadequate privacy and security measures. In a\nshared office space, privacy and security are paramount. This might mean\ninstalling lockers, locked storage spaces, and individual card access to\ndifferent areas in the building.\n\n* * *\n\n**_This article was first published in[Ambient\nConcept](http://ambientconcept.com.my/blog-ambientconcept-\nthe5typesofmalaysianofficelayouts/)._**\n\n**PHOTOS:** [Some of Asia's coolest\noffices](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/topics/spacial-awareness/)\n\n_Photos /[Ambient Concept](http://ambientconcept.com.my),\n[sbdsgn.de](https://sbdsgn.de/),\n[commonground.work](https://www.commonground.work/)_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n[\u95b1\u8b80\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u672c](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/?p=120726&preview=true)\n\nBig data, AI, digital analytics and robotics have been promising to disrupt\nthe world of work for some time. And now their disruptive influence is here.\nDisruptive, but also with the potential to be greatly beneficial to HR \u2013 both\nin terms of decision-making and time saved.\n\nUpheaval in the workplace has forced companies to reinvent roles, benefits and\nthe very definition of a career. Technology has transformed information\nsharing, communication and collaboration.\n\nPerversely, in this digitally rich world, leaders are being encouraged to be\nmore human, more approachable, while simultaneously remaining up to date in a\nfast-changing landscape.\n\nA recent comprehensive poll of leaders as part of [PwC\u2019s 22nd annual CEO\nsurvey](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-\nagenda/ceosurvey/2019/us?utm_campaign=sbpwc&utm_medium=site&utm_source=articletext)\n(including over 1300 CEOs from 91 jurisdictions) asked how worried they were\nabout a range of potential threats to their companies. A skills gap within\ntheir workforces was rated as their top concern.\n\nHowever, leaders need to be clear about identifying the expertise they\nrequire. So-called traditional skills such as emotional intelligence,\nadaptability, problem solving, resilience, creativity and innovation are still\nessential.\n\nBut if leaders are to realise the full value of these skills, they will need\nto carefully update and adapt the way they define and apply each of these\nskills for their own fast-evolving digital-human workplaces.\n\nSo the question is: How does a leader go about preserving their core skills\nwhile upgrading them for the fast-changing challenges of work?\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to say, \u201cKeep doing what you\u2019re doing, but just be a bit more\nand agile and digitally savvy with it\u201d. What\u2019s needed is to redefine the\nsituation from the inside out.\n\nBy doing so, leaders create a bridge from the old core skills to the new, and\nthey can chart a tangible course of action for the team to follow to generate\nmore value from each capability.\n\nThis fresh thinking doesn\u2019t just put a fresh coat of paint on old\ninfrastructure \u2013 it\u2019s more concrete than that.\n\nIt builds leaders prepared for the future who can adapt to the unexpected\ncircumstances they will invariably encounter in today\u2019s volatile workplace.\n\nSo don\u2019t wait for your favourite human resources magazine (unless it\u2019s this\none, of course) or social media influencers to tell you what needs doing.\nCoach yourself through the progression to master your own strengths and skills\nthat will help your organisation adapt to the future of work.\n\nParts of this article were first published in\n[strategy+business](https://www.strategy-business.com/blog/Update-your-\nleadership-skills-to-bridge-the-digital-human-divide?gko=9784f&sf213608731=1).\n\nHuman Resources magazine and the HR Bulletin daily email newsletter:  \nAsia's only regional HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\nBack to Top\n\n![Lim-Guan-Eng-2020-budget-reading-Ministry of Finance\nFacebook](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/14095230/Lim-Guan-Eng-2020-budget-reading-\nresized-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Previous Article:\n\n[[Live updates] Malaysia Budget 2020: What HR needs to\nknow](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/live-updates-malaysia-\nbudget-2020-what-hr-needs-to-know/)\n\n![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/10/14103356/Breaktheice_this_one-120x72.jpg)\n\n# Next Article:\n\n[Top 5 icebreaker questions HR should ask\ncandidates](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/top-5-icebreaker-questions-\nhr-should-ask-candidates/)\n\n# Read More News\n\n02/11/2015 Wed 11:24 AM in All markets by [Aditi Sharma\nKalra](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/author/aditis/ \"Posts by Aditi\nSharma Kalra\")\n\n## [What I learnt in my first week as a\nmanager](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/learnt-first-week-manager/ \"What\nI learnt in my first week as a manager\")\n\nManaging tasks and their deadlines is hard.

Why? Their analytics examine only the\n_attributes_ of employees, when people's _interactions_ are equally, if not\nmore, telling.\n\nResearch shows that a lot of employees' success can be explained by their\nrelationships--something that's the focus of a new discipline, _relational\nanalytics._ The key is finding \"structural signatures\": patterns in social\nnetworks that predict who will have good ideas, which employees have the most\ninfluence (it's not senior leaders), which teams will be efficient, which will\ninnovate best, where silos exist, and which employees firms can't afford to\nlose.\n\nThis article describes what indicators to watch for and how most firms already\nhave the raw material they need to build relational analytics models: the\n\"digital exhaust\" from their internal communications.\n\n#### Idea in brief\n\n##### The Challenge\n\nTo bring the performance of people analytics up\u2014and in line with the\nhype\u2014companies need to do more than analyze data on demographic attributes.\n\n##### The Solution\n\nEmploy relational analytics, which examines data on how people interact, to\nfind out who has good ideas, who is influential, what teams will get work done\non time, and more.\n\n##### The Raw Material\n\nCompanies can mine their \u201cdigital exhaust\u201d\u2014data created by employees every day\nin their digital transactions, such as e-mails, chats, and file\ncollaboration\u2014for insights into their workforce.\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2018/11/better-people-analytics?language=es)\n\n\u201cWe have charts and graphs to back us up. So f*** off.\u201d New hires in Google\u2019s\npeople analytics department began receiving a laptop sticker with that slogan\na few years ago, when the group probably felt it needed to defend its work.\nBack then people analytics\u2014using statistical insights from employee data to\nmake talent management decisions\u2014was still a provocative idea with plenty of\nskeptics who feared it might lead companies to reduce individuals to numbers.\nHR collected data on workers, but the notion that it could be actively mined\nto understand and manage them was novel\u2014and suspect.\n\nToday there\u2019s no need for stickers. More than 70% of\n[companies](https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-\ntrends/2017/people-analytics-in-hr.html) now say they consider people\nanalytics to be a high priority. The field even has celebrated case studies,\nlike Google\u2019s [Project Oxygen,](/2013/12/how-google-sold-its-engineers-on-\nmanagement?autocomplete=true) which uncovered the practices of the tech\ngiant\u2019s best managers and then used them in coaching sessions to improve the\nwork of low performers. Other examples, such as Dell\u2019s experiments with\nincreasing the success of its sales force, also point to the power of people\nanalytics.\n\nBut hype, as it often does, has outpaced reality. The truth is, people\nanalytics has made only modest progress over the past decade. [A\nsurvey](/2017/06/hr-must-make-people-analytics-more-user-friendly) by Tata\nConsultancy Services found that just 5% of big-data investments go to HR, the\ngroup that typically manages people analytics. And a [recent\nstudy](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/About-\nDeloitte/central-europe/ce-global-human-capital-trends.pdf) by Deloitte showed\nthat although people analytics has become mainstream, only 9% of companies\nbelieve they have a good understanding of which talent dimensions drive\nperformance in their organizations.\n\nWhat gives? If, as the sticker says, people analytics teams have charts and\ngraphs to back them up, why haven\u2019t results followed? We believe it\u2019s because\nmost rely on a narrow approach to data analysis: They use data only about\nindividual people, when data about the interplay _among_ people is equally or\nmore important.\n\nPeople\u2019s interactions are the focus of an emerging discipline we call\n_relational analytics._ By incorporating it into their people analytics\nstrategies, companies can better identify employees who are capable of helping\nthem achieve their goals, whether for increased innovation, influence, or\nefficiency. Firms will also gain insight into which key players they can\u2019t\nafford to lose and where silos exist in their organizations.\n\nMost people analytics teams rely on a narrow approach to data analysis.\n\nFortunately, the raw material for relational analytics already exists in\ncompanies. It\u2019s the data created by e-mail exchanges, chats, and file\ntransfers\u2014the _digital exhaust_ of a company. By mining it, firms can build\ngood relational analytics models.\n\nIn this article we present a framework for understanding and applying\nrelational analytics. And we have the charts and graphs to back us up.\n\n## Relational Analytics: A Deeper Definition\n\nTo date, people analytics has focused mostly on employee _attribute_ data, of\nwhich there are two kinds:\n\n  * _Trait:_ facts about individuals that don\u2019t change, such as ethnicity, gender, and work history.\n  * _State:_ facts about individuals that do change, such as age, education level, company tenure, value of received bonuses, commute distance, and days absent.\n\nThe two types of data are often aggregated to identify group characteristics,\nsuch as ethnic makeup, gender diversity, and average compensation.\n\nAttribute analytics is necessary but not sufficient. Aggregate attribute data\nmay seem like relational data because it involves more than one person, but\nit\u2019s not. Relational data captures, for example, the communications between\ntwo people in different departments in a day. In short, relational analytics\nis the science of human social networks.\n\nDecades of research convincingly show that the relationships employees have\nwith one another\u2014together with their individual attributes\u2014can explain their\nworkplace performance. The key is finding \u201cstructural signatures\u201d: patterns in\nthe data that correlate to some form of good (or bad) performance. Just as\nneurologists can identify structural signatures in the brain\u2019s networks that\npredict [bipolar\ndisorder](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322307001023)\nand [schizophrenia,\n](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/31/3/672/1894522)and\nchemists can look at the structural signatures of a liquid and predict its\n[kinetic fragility,](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5616)\norganizational leaders can look at structural signatures in their companies\u2019\nsocial networks and predict how, say, creative or effective individual\nemployees, teams, or the organization as a whole will be.\n\n## The Six Signatures of Relational Analytics\n\nDrawing from our own research and our consulting work with companies, as well\nas from a large body of other scholars\u2019 research, we have identified six\nstructural signatures that should form the bedrock of any relational analytics\nstrategy.\n\nLet\u2019s look at each one in turn.\n\n## Ideation\n\nMost companies try to identify people who are good at ideation by examining\nattributes like educational background, experience, personality, and native\nintelligence. Those things are important, but they don\u2019t help us see people\u2019s\naccess to information from others or the diversity of their sources of\ninformation\u2014both of which are arguably even more important. Good idea\ngenerators often synthesize information from one team with information from\nanother to develop a new product concept. Or they use a solution created in\none division to solve a problem in another. In other words, they occupy a\nbrokerage position in networks.\n\n#### Ideation Signature\n\nFocus: Individual\n\nPredicts: Which employees will come up with good ideas\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/R1806E_IDEATION.png)\n\nPurple shows _low constraint:_ He communicates with people in several other\nnetworks besides his own, which makes him more likely to get novel information\nthat will lead to good ideas. Orange, who communicates only with people within\nhis network, is less likely to generate ideas, even though he may be creative.\n\n#### Ideation Signature\n\nFocus: Individual\n\nPredicts: Which employees will come up with good ideas\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/R1806E_IDEATION.png)\n\nPurple shows _low constraint:_ He communicates with people in several other\nnetworks besides his own, which makes him more likely to get novel information\nthat will lead to good ideas. Orange, who communicates only with people within\nhis network, is less likely to generate ideas, even though he may be creative.\n\nThe sociologist Ronald Burt has developed a measure that indicates whether\nsomeone is in a brokerage position. Known as _constraint,_ it captures how\nlimited a person is when gathering unique information. Study after study,\nacross populations as diverse as bankers, lawyers, analysts, engineers, and\nsoftware developers, has shown that employees with low constraint\u2014who aren\u2019t\nbound by a small, tight network of people\u2014are more likely to generate ideas\nthat management views as novel and useful.\n\nIn one [study,](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/421787)\nBurt followed the senior leaders at a large U.S. electronics company as they\napplied relational analytics to determine which of 600-plus supply chain\nmanagers were most likely to develop ideas that improved efficiency. They used\na survey to solicit such ideas from the managers and at the same time gather\ninformation on their networks. Senior executives then scored each of the\nsubmitted ideas for their novelty and potential value.\n\nThe only attribute that remotely predicted whether an individual would\ngenerate a valuable idea was seniority at the company, and its correlation\nwasn\u2019t strong. Using the ideation signature\u2014low constraint\u2014was far more\npowerful: Supply chain managers who exhibited it in their networks were\nsignificantly more likely to generate good ideas than managers with high\nconstraint.\n\nA [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/smj.2755) Paul did\nat a large software development company bolsters this finding. The company\u2019s\nR&D department was a \u201ccaveman world.\u201d Though it employed more than 100\nengineers, on average each one talked to only five other people. And those\nfive people typically talked only to one another. Their contact with other\n\u201ccaves\u201d was limited.\n\nSuch high-constraint networks are quite common in organizations, especially\nthose that do specialized work. But that doesn\u2019t mean low-constraint\nindividuals aren\u2019t hiding in plain sight. At the software company, relational\nanalytics was able to pinpoint a few engineers who did span multiple networks.\nManagement then generated a plan for encouraging them to do what they were\nnaturally inclined to, and soon saw a significant increase in both the\nquantity\u2014and quality\u2014of ideas they proposed for product improvements.\n\n## Influence\n\nDeveloping a good idea is no guarantee that people will use it. Similarly,\njust because an executive issues a decree for change, that doesn\u2019t mean\nemployees will carry it out. Getting ideas implemented requires influence.\n\n#### Influence Signature\n\nFocus: Individual\n\nPredicts: Which employees will change others\u2019 behavior\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/R1806E_INFLUENCE.png)\n\nThough she connects to only two people, purple is more influential than\norange, because purple\u2019s connections are better connected. Purple shows\n_higher aggregate prominence._ Orange may spread ideas faster, but purple can\nspread ideas further because her connections are more influential.\n\n#### Influence Signature\n\nFocus: Individual\n\nPredicts: Which employees will change others\u2019 behavior\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/R1806E_INFLUENCE.png)\n\nThough she connects to only two people, purple is more influential than\norange, because purple\u2019s connections are better connected. Purple shows\n_higher aggregate prominence._ Orange may spread ideas faster, but purple can\nspread ideas further because her connections are more influential.\n\nBut influence doesn\u2019t work the way we might assume.\n[Research](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.34.10.1252)\nshows that employees are not most influenced, positively or negatively, by the\ncompany\u2019s senior leadership. Rather, it\u2019s people in less formal roles who sway\nthem the most.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, executives should just identify the popular employees and\nhave them persuade their coworkers to get on board with new initiatives,\nright? Wrong.\n\nA large medical device manufacturer that Paul worked with tried that approach\nwhen it was launching new compliance policies. Hoping to spread positive\nperceptions about them, the change management team shared the policies\u2019\nvirtues with the workers who had been rated influential by the highest number\nof colleagues. But six months later employees still weren\u2019t following the new\nprocedures.\n\nWhy? A counterintuitive insight from relational analytics offers the\nexplanation: Employees cited as influential by a large number of colleagues\naren\u2019t always the most influential people. Rather, the greatest influencers\nare people who have strong connections to others, even if only to a few\npeople. Moreover, their strong connections in turn have strong connections of\ntheir own with other people. This means influencers\u2019 ideas can spread further.\n\nThe structural signature of influence is called _aggregate prominence,_ and\nit\u2019s computed by measuring how well a person\u2019s connections are connected, and\nhow well the connections\u2019 connections are connected. (A similar logic is used\nby search engines to rank-order search results.)\n\nEmployees are not most influenced by the company\u2019s senior leadership.\n\nIn each of nine divisions at the medical device manufacturer, relational\nanalytics identified the five individuals who had the highest aggregate\nprominence scores. The company asked for their thoughts on the new policies.\nAbout three-quarters viewed them favorably. The firm provided facts that would\nallay fears of the change to them as well as to the influencers who didn\u2019t\nlike the policies\u2014and then waited for the results.\n\nSix months later more than 75% of the employees in those nine divisions had\nadopted the new compliance policies. In contrast, only 15% of employees had\nadopted them in the remaining seven affected divisions, where relational\nanalytics had not been applied.\n\n## Efficiency\n\nStaffing a team that will get work done efficiently seems as if it should be\nsimple. Just tap the people who have the best relevant skills.\n\n#### Efficiency Signature\n\nFocus: Team\n\nPredicts: Which teams will complete projects on time\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/R1806E_EFFICIENCY.png)\n\nThe purple team members are deeply connected with one another\u2014showing _high\ninternal density._ This indicates that they work well together. And because\nmembers\u2019 external connections don\u2019t overlap, the team has _high external\nrange,_ which gives it greater access to helpful outside resources.\n\n#### Efficiency Signature\n\nFocus: Team\n\nPredicts: Which teams will complete projects on time\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/R1806E_EFFICIENCY.png)\n\nThe purple team members are deeply connected with one another\u2014showing _high\ninternal density._ This indicates that they work well together. And because\nmembers\u2019 external connections don\u2019t overlap, the team has _high external\nrange,_ which gives it greater access to helpful outside resources.\n\nAttribute analytics can help identify skilled people, but it won\u2019t ensure that\nthe work gets done on time. For that, you need relational analytics measuring\nteam chemistry and the ability to draw on outside information and expertise.\n\nConsider the findings of a\n[study](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2307/4131457) by Ray Reagans, Ezra\nZuckerman, and Bill McEvily, which analyzed more than 1,500 project teams at a\nmajor U.S. contract R&D firm. Hypothesizing that the ability to access a wide\nrange of information, perspectives, and resources would improve team\nperformance, the researchers compared the effect of demographic diversity on\nteams\u2019 results with the effect of team members\u2019 social networks. One issue was\nthat diversity at the firm had only two real variables, tenure and function.\n(The other variables\u2014race, gender, and education\u2014were consolidated within\nfunctions.) Nevertheless, the results showed that diversity in those two areas\nhad little impact on performance.\n\nA slight increase in internal density and external range would save 2,200\nhours.\n\nTurning to the relational data, though, offered better insight. The\nresearchers found that two social variables were associated with higher\nperformance. The first was _internal density,_ the amount of interaction and\ninterconnectedness among team members. High internal density is critical for\nbuilding trust, taking risks, and reaching agreement on important issues. The\nsecond was the _external range_ of team members\u2019 contacts. On a team that has\nhigh external range, each member can reach outside the team to experts who are\ndistinct from the contacts of other members. That makes the team better able\nto source vital information and secure resources it needs to meet deadlines.\nThe structural signature for efficient teams is therefore high internal\ndensity plus high external range.\n\nAt the R&D firm the teams that had this signature completed projects much\nfaster than teams that did not. The researchers estimated that if 30% of\nproject teams at the firm had internal density and external range just one\nstandard deviation above the mean, it would save more than 2,200 labor hours\nin 17 days\u2014the equivalent of completing nearly 200 additional projects.\n\n## Innovation\n\nTeams with the efficiency signature would most likely fail as innovation\nunits, which benefit from some disagreement and strife.\n\n#### Innovation Signature\n\nFocus: Team\n\nPredicts: Which teams will innovate effectively\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/R1806E_INNOVATION.png)\n\nPurple team members aren\u2019t deeply interconnected; their team has _low internal\ndensity._ This suggests they\u2019ll have different perspectives and more-\nproductive debates. The members also have _high external range,_ or wide,\ndiverse connections, which will help them gain buy-in for their innovations.\n\n#### Innovation Signature\n\nFocus: Team\n\nPredicts: Which teams will innovate effectively\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/R1806E_INNOVATION.png)\n\nPurple team members aren\u2019t deeply interconnected; their team has _low internal\ndensity._ This suggests they\u2019ll have different perspectives and more-\nproductive debates. The members also have _high external range,_ or wide,\ndiverse connections, which will help them gain buy-in for their innovations.\n\nWhat else makes for a successful team of innovators? You might think that\nputting your highest-performing employees together would produce the best\nresults, but research suggests that it might have negative effects on\nperformance. And while the conventional wisdom is that teams are more creative\nwhen they comprise members with different points of view, research also\nindicates that demographic diversity is not a good predictor of team\ninnovation success. In our experience, even staffing an innovation team with\nideators often produces no better than average performance.\n\nBut if you turn to relational analytics, you can use the same variables you\nuse for team efficiency\u2014internal density and external range\u2014to create\npromising innovation teams. The formula is a bit different, though: The\ninnovation signature is high external range and low internal density. That is,\nyou still want team members with wide, nonoverlapping social networks\n(influential ones, if possible) to source diverse ideas and information. But\nyou do not want a tight-knit team.\n\nWhy? Greater interaction within a team results in similar ways of thinking and\nless discord. That\u2019s good for efficiency but not for innovation. The most\ninnovative teams have disagreements and discussion\u2014sometimes even\n[conflict](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-99635-017)\u2014that generate the\ncreative friction necessary to produce breakthroughs.\n\nThe high external range is needed not just to bring in ideas but also to\ngarner support and buy-in. Innovation teams have to finance, build, and sell\ntheir ideas, so well-connected external contacts who become the teams\u2019\nchampions can have a big impact on their success.\n\nFor several years, Paul worked with a large U.S.-based automobile\n[company](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amd.2015.0151) that was trying\nto improve its product-development process. Each of its global product-\ndevelopment centers had a team of subject-matter experts focused on that\nchallenge. The program leader noted, \u201cWe are very careful about who we select.\nWe get the people with the right functional backgrounds, who have consistently\ndone innovative work, and we make sure there is a mix of them from different\nbackgrounds and that they are different ages.\u201d In other words, the centers\nused attribute analytics to form teams.\n\nManagers at a new India center couldn\u2019t build a demographically diverse team,\nhowever: All the center\u2019s engineers were roughly the same age, had similar\nbackgrounds, and were about the same rank. So the manager instead chose\nengineers who had worked on projects with different offices and worked in\ndifferent areas of the center\u2014creating a team that naturally had a higher\nexternal range.\n\nIt so happened that such a team showed lower internal density as well. Its\nmembers felt free to debate, and they ran tests to resolve differences of\nopinion. Once they found a new procedure, they went back to their external\nconnections, using them as influencers who could persuade others to validate\ntheir work.\n\nAfter three years the India center\u2019s team was producing more process\ninnovations than any of the other teams. After five years it had generated\nalmost twice as many as all the other teams combined. In response, the company\nbegan supplementing its attribute analytics with relational analytics to\nreconfigure the innovation teams at its other locations.\n\n## Silos\n\nEveryone hates silos, but they\u2019re natural and unavoidable. As organizations\ndevelop deep areas of expertise, almost inevitably functions, departments, and\ndivisions become less and less able to work together. They don\u2019t speak the\nsame technical language or have the same goals.\n\n#### Silo Signature\n\nFocus: Organization\n\nPredicts: Whether an organization is siloed\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/R1806E_SILO.png)\n\nEach color indicates a department. People within the departments are deeply\nconnected, but only one or two people in any department connect with people in\nother departments. The groups\u2019 _modularity_ \u2014the ratio of internal to external\ncommunication\u2014is high.\n\n#### Silo Signature\n\nFocus: Organization\n\nPredicts: Whether an organization is siloed\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/R1806E_SILO.png)\n\nEach color indicates a department. People within the departments are deeply\nconnected, but only one or two people in any department connect with people in\nother departments. The groups\u2019 _modularity_ \u2014the ratio of internal to external\ncommunication\u2014is high.\n\nWe assess the degree to which an organization is siloed by measuring its\n_modularity._ Most simply, modularity is the ratio of communication within a\ngroup to communication outside the group. When the ratio of internal to\nexternal communication is greater than 5:1, the group is detrimentally siloed.\n\nOne of the most strikingly siloed organizations we\u2019ve encountered was a small\nnot-for-profit consumer advocacy group, which wanted to understand why traffic\non its website had declined. The 60 employees at its Chicago office were\ndivided among four departments: business development, operations, marketing\nand PR, and finance. Typical of silos, each department had different ideas\nabout what was going on.\n\nAnalysis showed that all four departments exceeded the 5:1 ratio of internal\nto external contacts. The most extreme case was operations, with a ratio of\n13:1. Of course, operations was the department with its finger most squarely\non the pulse of consumers who visited the site. It sat on a trove of data\nabout when and why people came to the site to complain about or praise\ncompanies.\n\nOther departments didn\u2019t even know that operations collected that data. And\noperations didn\u2019t know that other departments might find it useful.\n\nTo fix the problem, the organization asked specific employees in each\ndepartment to become liaisons. They instituted a weekly meeting at which\nmanagers from all departments got together to talk about their work. Each\nmeeting was themed, so lower-level employees whose work related to the theme\nalso were brought into the discussions.\n\nIn short, the not-for-profit engineered higher external range into its staff.\nAs a result, operations learned that marketing and PR could make hay out of\nfindings that linked a growing volume of complaints in a specific industry to\ncertain weather patterns and seasons. Because operations employees learned\nthat such insights would be useful, they began to analyze their data in new\nways.\n\n## Vulnerability\n\nAlthough having people who can help move information and insights from one\npart of the organization to another is healthy, an overreliance on those\nindividuals can make a company vulnerable.\n\n#### Vulnerability Signature\n\nFocus: Organization\n\nPredicts: Which employees the organization can\u2019t afford to lose\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/R1806E_VULNERABILITY.png)\n\nGreen is a critical external supplier to company departments blue, purple, and\norange. Six people at the company have relationships with green, but 30 people\nrely on those relationships\u2014which puts the company at risk. If blue\u2019s one\nconnection to green leaves, for example, the department will be cut off from\nthe supplier. While his title may not reflect his importance, that employee is\nvital to information flow.\n\n#### Vulnerability Signature\n\nFocus: Organization\n\nPredicts: Which employees the organization can\u2019t afford to lose\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/10/R1806E_VULNERABILITY.png)\n\nGreen is a critical external supplier to company departments blue, purple, and\norange. Six people at the company have relationships with green, but 30 people\nrely on those relationships\u2014which puts the company at risk. If blue\u2019s one\nconnection to green leaves, for example, the department will be cut off from\nthe supplier. While his title may not reflect his importance, that employee is\nvital to information flow.\n\nTake the case of an employee we\u2019ll call Arvind, who was a manager in the\npackaging division at one of the world\u2019s top consumer goods companies. He was\na connector who bridged several divisions. He talked regularly with\ncounterparts and suppliers across the world. But on the organizational chart,\nArvind was nobody special: just a midlevel manager who was good at his job.\nCompanies are at risk of losing employees like Arvind because no obvious\nattribute signals their importance, so firms don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve got until\nit\u2019s gone.\n\nWithout Arvind, the packaging division would lack _robustness._ Networks are\nrobust when connections can be maintained if you remove nodes\u2014employees\u2014from\nit. In this case, if Arvind left the company, some departments would lose all\nconnection with other departments and with suppliers.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that Arvind was irreplaceable. He just wasn\u2019t _backed up._ The\ncompany didn\u2019t realize that no other nodes were making the necessary network\nconnections he provided. That made it vulnerable: If Arvind was out sick or on\nvacation, work slowed. If Arvind decided that he didn\u2019t like one of the\nsuppliers and stopped interacting with it, work slowed. And if Arvind had too\nmuch on his plate and couldn\u2019t keep up with his many connections, work also\nslowed.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that Arvind was irreplaceable. He just wasn\u2019t backed up.\n\nOn the day Noshir came to show the company this vulnerability in the packaging\ndivision, he entered a boardroom filled with cakes and sweets. A senior\nexecutive happily told him that the firm was throwing a party for Arvind. He\nwas retiring. Noshir\u2019s jaw dropped. The party went on, but after learning how\nimportant Arvind was, the company worked out a deal to retain him for several\nmore years and, in the meantime, used relational analytics to do some\nsuccession planning so that multiple people could take on his role.\n\n## Capture Your Company\u2019s Digital Exhaust\n\nOnce you understand the six structural signatures that form the basis of\nrelational analytics, it\u2019s relatively easy to act on the insights they\nprovide. Often, the fixes they suggest aren\u2019t complex: Set up cross-functional\nmeetings, enable influential people, retain your Arvinds.\n\nWhy, then, don\u2019t most companies use relational analytics for performance\nmanagement? There are two reasons. The first is that many network analyses\ncompanies do are little more than pretty pictures of nodes and edges. They\ndon\u2019t identify the patterns that predict performance.\n\nThe second reason is that most organizations don\u2019t have information systems in\nplace to capture relational data. But all companies do have a crucial hidden\nresource: their digital exhaust\u2014the logs, e-trails, and contents of everyday\ndigital activity. Every time employees send one another e-mails in Outlook,\nmessage one another on Slack, like posts on Facebook\u2019s Workplace, form teams\nin Microsoft Teams, or assign people to project milestones in Trello, the\nplatforms record the interactions. This information can be used to construct\nviews of employee, team, and organizational networks in which you can pick out\nthe structural signatures we\u2019ve discussed.\n\nFor several years we\u2019ve been developing a dashboard that captures digital\nexhaust in real time from these various platforms and uses relational\nanalytics to help managers find the right employees for tasks, staff teams for\nefficiency and innovation, and identify areas in the organization that are\nsiloed and vulnerable to turnover. Here are some of the things we\u2019ve learned\nin the process:\n\n### Passive collection is easier on employees.\n\nTo gather relational data, companies typically survey employees about whom\nthey interact with. Surveys take time, however, and the answers can vary in\naccuracy (some employees are just guessing). Also, to be truly useful,\nrelational data must come from everyone at the company, not just a few people.\nAs an executive at a large financial services company told us, \u201cIf I gave each\nof my 15,000 employees a survey that takes half an hour to do, we\u2019ve just lost\na million dollars in productivity. And what if their relationships change in a\nmonth? Will we have to do it again at a cost of an additional $1 million in\npeople hours?\u201d\n\nCompany-collected relational data, however, creates new challenges. Although\nmost employment contracts give firms the right to record and monitor\nactivities conducted on company systems, some employees feel that the passive\ncollection of relational data is an invasion of privacy. This is not a trivial\nconcern. Companies need clear HR policies about the gathering and analysis of\ndigital exhaust that help employees understand and feel comfortable with it.\n\n#### What About Employee Privacy?\n\nRelational analytics changes the equation when it comes to the privacy of\nemployee data. When employees actively provide information about themselves in\nhiring forms, surveys, and the like, they know their company has and can use\nit. But they may not even realize that the passive collection of relational\ndata\u2014such as whom they chat with on Slack or when they were copied on\ne-mail\u2014is happening or that such information is being analyzed.\n\nJob one for companies is to be transparent. If they\u2019re going to amass digital\nexhaust, they should ask employees to sign an agreement indicating they\nunderstand that their patterns of interaction on company-owned tools will be\ntracked for the purposes of analyzing the organization\u2019s social networks. Full\ndisclosure with employee consent is the only option.\n\nWe\u2019ve found some additional moves leaders can make to get ahead of privacy\nconcerns:\n\nFirst, give employees whatever relational data you collect about them. We\nrecommend providing it at least annually. The data can include a map of the\nemployee\u2019s own network and benchmarks. For example, a report could provide an\nemployee with her constraint score (which shows how inbred someone\u2019s social\nnetwork is) and the average constraint score of employees in her department.\nThat score could then be at the center of a mentoring discussion.\n\nSecond, be clear about the depth of relational analytics you intend to invest\nin. The level that is most basic\u2014and the least prone to privacy concerns\u2014is\ngeneric pattern analysis. The analysis might show, for example, that marketing\nis a silo but not identify specific individuals that contribute to that silo.\nOr the analysis could show that a certain percentage of teams have the\nsignature for innovation but not identify which teams.\n\nThe second level identifies which specific employees in a company have certain\nkinds of networks. Scores may provide evidence-based predictions about\nemployee behavior\u2014such as who is likely to be an influencer or whose departure\nwould make an organization vulnerable. Although this level of analysis\nprovides more value to the company, it singles particular employees out.\n\nThe highest level pairs relational analytics with machine learning. In this\nscenario, companies collect data about whom employees interact with and about\nthe topics they discuss. Firms examine the content of e-mails and posts on\nsocial-networking sites to identify who has expertise in what domains. This\ninformation provides the most specific guidance for leaders\u2014for example, about\nwho is likely to develop good ideas in certain areas. This most advanced level\nobviously also comes with the most privacy concerns, and senior leadership\nmust develop deeply considered strategies to deal with them.\n\n### Behavioral data is a better reflection of reality.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted, digital exhaust is less biased than data collected through\nsurveys. For instance, in surveys people may list connections they think\nthey\u2019re supposed to interact with, rather than those they actually do interact\nwith. And because every employee will be on at least several communication\nplatforms, companies can map networks representing the entire workforce, which\nmakes the analysis more accurate.\n\nAlso, not all behaviors are equal. Liking someone\u2019s post is different from\nworking on a team with someone for two years. Copying someone on an e-mail\ndoes not indicate a strong relationship. How all those individual behaviors\nare weighted and combined matters. This is where machine-learning algorithms\nand simulation models are helpful. With a little technical know-how (and with\nan understanding of which structural signatures predict what performance\noutcomes), setting up those systems is not hard to do.\n\n### Constant updating is required.\n\nRelationships are dynamic. People and projects come and go. To be useful,\nrelational data must be timely. Using digital exhaust in a relational\nanalytics model addresses that need.\n\nAdditionally, collecting relational data over time gives analysts more choices\nabout what to examine. For example, if an employee was out on maternity leave\nfor several months, an analyst can exclude that time period from the data or\ndecide to aggregate a larger swath of data. If a company was acquired in a\nparticular year, an analyst can compare relational data from before and after\nthe deal to chart how the company\u2019s vulnerabilities may have changed.\n\n### Analyses need to be close to decision makers.\n\nMost companies rely on data scientists to cull insights related to talent and\nperformance management. That often creates a bottleneck, because there aren\u2019t\nenough data scientists to address all management queries in a timely manner.\nPlus, data scientists don\u2019t know the employees they are running analyses on,\nso they cannot put results into context.\n\n### Dashboards are key.\n\nA system that identifies structural signatures and highlights them visually\nmoves analytic insights closer to the managers who need them. As one executive\nat a semiconductor chip firm told us, \u201cI want my managers to have the data to\nmake good decisions about how to use their employees. And I want them to be\nable to do it when those decision points happen, not later.\u201d\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nPeople analytics is a new way to make evidence-based decisions that improve\norganizations. But in these early days, most companies have been focused on\nthe attributes of individuals, rather than on their relationships with other\nemployees. Looking at attributes will take firms only so far. If they harness\nrelational analytics, however, they can estimate the likelihood that an\nemployee, a team, or an entire organization will achieve a performance goal.\nThey can also use algorithms to tailor staff assignments to changes in\nemployee networks or to a particular managerial need. The best firms, of\ncourse, will use relational analytics to augment their own decision criteria\nand build healthier, happier, and more-productive organizations.\n\nA version of this article appeared in the [November\u2013December 2018](/archive-\ntoc/BR1806) issue (pp.70-81) of _Harvard Business Review_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Paul Leonardi](/search?term=paul%20leonardi&search_type=search-all) is the\nDuca Family Professor of Technology Management at the University of\nCalifornia, Santa Barbara, and advises companies about how to use social\nnetwork data and new technologies to improve performance and employee well-\nbeing.

We also organise in-house badminton\nmatches, weekly pop-pilates, yoga and Zumba classes in the office for\ncolleagues to participate after work,\" **Pheona Chua** , senior consultant for\ncorporate health & well-being at Willis Towers Watson Asia, told _Singapore\nBusiness Review_.\n\n\"Many large firms also provide employee assistance programmes to support\nemployees with all rounded mental well-being initiatives. Mid and smaller\nfirms typically organise lunch-and-learn sessions and a series of support\ngroup workshops that are highly effective in smaller groups,\" she said. \"When\nwe consider programmes to an individual's needs, they typically respond with\nhigher level of engagements which boost productivity level. This leads to a\nreduction in absenteeism and turnover rates.\"\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by Willis Towers Watson in 2018, firms with\neffective and tailored health and wellbeing programmes in place are two times\nmore likely to outperform their peers, 50% more likely than competitors to\nreport lower turnover rates, and are seeing fewer days of unplanned absences\nper year.\n\n\"Some companies have employed an in-house mindfulness and meditation coach to\nensure the welfare of their employees. Some firms have also included an on-\nsite meditation room or sent their employees on workshops with external\ncoaches,\" **Ling Xiang Lee** , Robert Walters Singapore's manager for sales &\nmarketing, industrial, technology and services, noted.\n\nRobert Walters Singapore provides insurance coverage that allows employees to\npick and choose the kind of wellness benefits workers want, such as\ntraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and healthier meal options. These little\nperks are said to have cultivated a positive work environment with higher\nemployee engagement and improved productivity at the firm.\n\nAlong the same lines, Robert Half launched its own wellness programme \"It's\nTime We All Work Happy\" in 2018, comprising five key initiatives touching on\nhealth and physical wellbeing, flexible working arrangements, and social\nresponsibility.\n\n\"This includes the provision of a weekly personal trainer for group staff\nworkouts, discounted health club memberships, the option to leave work at 4\np.m. on Fridays, a monthly allotment of time to enjoy lunch with your family,\nfree health checks, and quarterly charitable initiatives,\" **Mathieu Imbert-\nBouchard** , managing director of Robert Half Singapore, said. \"Exercise\nclasses, such as relaxation and meditation can be part of a company's wellness\nprogramme which can better equip employees to cope with stress.\"\n\nBut like with most employee-geared initiatives, wellness programmes are not\ncookie cutter, with younger workers perhaps being more receptive to digital\nsolutions whilst baby boomers may be contented with employers providing them\nwith free fruits every week at their workplace, Chua noted. So where should\nbusinesses start with coming up with their own wellness programmes?\n\nAccording to Chua, a baseline assessment is always the key foundation to\nbuilding any well-being programme.\n\nThis sentiment was shared by **Amitabh Deka** , head of wellbeing solutions\nand Aon Care at Aon South Asia, who explained that baseline assessments\ninclude attention to the programme scope and objectives in light of the\navailable resources, the organisation's vision, and the current state of\nemployee health.\n\n\"The most common means of getting a baseline assessment is health risk\nassessment as it focuses on lifestyle risk. Companies can develop their own\nquestions or adapt it from public sources,\" Chua said. \"However, companies do\nnot usually do that as that will mean the HR team will need to consolidate the\nreport and analyse it thereafter. And most of the time, they either do not\nhave the bandwidth or the relevant knowledge in doing so. That is also the\nreason why many companies are engaging professionals to do it.\"\n\nWhilst Imbert-Bouchard noted that there is no standard practice across\nSingaporean companies, some efforts have been made to move into that\ndirection.\n\n**Inter-generational segmentation**  \nDeka also observed that a popular approach some firms have taken is the inter-\ngenerational segmentation. \"At Aon, we refer to employees aged up to 35 years\nas 'Young Guns', those between 36 to 50 years as 'Sandwich Generation' and\nones above 50 years as 'Silver Heroes',\" he said, stressing that these\nworkforce generations unsurprisingly differ predominantly in life values,\nmotivation triggers and health status.\n\n\"For instance - young guns are perceived as ambitious, but they have been\nnoticed to take downtime to reinvigorate themselves, were found to be\nphysically fit and socially active, and their wellbeing needs are around\nemotional and financial wellbeing. The sandwich generation find themselves\neither insecure or accomplished, often preoccupied with meeting their\ncommitments, with a dip in physical activity and sleep but increase in stress.\nThey often fall prey to lifestyle diseases,\" he explained.\n\nMeanwhile, silver heroes are more likely to achieve purposeful living but tend\nto struggle with activity limitations due to ageing; pain, mobility and sleep\nare key health issues for them.\n\nTo Deka, successful wellbeing programmes respect the inherent diversity that a\nmultigenerational workforce presents with. \"No doubt it is complex to manage,\nbut it is a challenge worth investing in. Weaving the varied needs and drivers\nof an intergenerational workforce begins right at the initial step of crafting\na wellbeing programme- during identification of objectives and establishing\nthe baseline,\" he noted.\n\nBusinesses may even look to mobile apps to support employees. \"Mindi and\nheadspace are a few examples of these popular apps available in this space.\nSuch apps provide quick and small bit-sized 'on-the-go' meditation exercises\nthat are suitable for busy executives who do not have the time to attend fixed\nsessions organised at the workplace,\" Chua added.\n\nBut simply implementing a workplace wellness programme though - no matter how\neffective - is not enough to ensure that all employees' health and wellbeing\nneeds are being fully met, Ling underlined.\n\nA 2018 report by PwC echoed this, noting that workplace health programmes have\nbeen shown to be more effective with strong and consistent support from\ncompany leaders. This is because management support can generate and preserve\nthe programme resources, increase its legitimacy and provide role modelling.\n\n\"Team leaders and senior managers must have regular one-on-one contact with\nteam members in a confidential manner, to keep up-to-date on how each\nindividual is feeling and what challenges they may be facing both at work and\nin their personal lives. This will allow managers to adapt their\norganisation's wellness initiatives and working environment to help make their\nteam members feel more supported,\" Ling added.  \n\nDo you know more about this story?

Thus, companies are ignoring their two most important\nassets: their people and finances,\" the report's researchers said.\n\n**Also read:** [One-third of firms invested over US$1m in digital\ntransformation: study](https://sbr.com.sg/information-technology/news/one-\nthird-firms-invested-over-us1m-in-digital-transformation-study)\n\nAccording to the survey, 76% of C-level executives say their organisation has\nyet to achieve any major return on investment (ROI) improvements in digital\ntransformation, of which 53% of C-level executives say they have not achieved\nany measurable ROI.\n\n\"This may be due to a failure by organisations to use a balanced scorecard\napproach to align and measure investments and ROI, with only 28% of finance\nrespondents and IT respondents are using balanced scorecards, followed by 27%\nfor HR leaders,\" Workday said.\n\nMeanwhile, 64 of C-level executives in Singapore see lack of common\ntechnologies and processes as the top barriers to cross-functional\ncollaboration, and believe organisations should make more investments in the\nright technologies (42%) as one of their priorities to drive digitalisation.\nThe top priority for organisations is to implement new and better metrics and\nkey performance indicators (49%).\n\n**Also read:** [SMEs open to business transformation investments amidst\nsouring economic expectations: poll](https://sbr.com.sg/markets-\ninvesting/news/smes-open-business-transformation-investments-amidst-souring-\neconomic-expecta)\n\nFrom the perspective of HR and finance leaders, 93% of HR leaders and 50% of\nfinance leaders say an integrated finance and HR technology solution is\nimportant for greater visibility, despite 83% of finance leaders and 80% of HR\nleaders saying their processes are not fully integrated across departments.\n\n\"It's astounding to see how many digital transformation initiatives within\norganisations are failing. Whilst functional levels may have digital\ninitiatives, true digital transformation must happen at the enterprise level,\nand implicitly cross-functional in nature, to succeed,\" Workday Asia's\npresident Rob Wells said.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

Of those who felt excluded, 60% disclosed that\nthis has not happened in the last year.\n\nSingapore is also one of the most gender-equal nations, where 67% received\nequal pay and rewards regardless of gender--up from 40% in 2017.\n\nAbout 40% of all respondents across five regions said they have women managers\nin their midst, an improvement from 39% last year.\n\nMeanwhile, leadership bias remains high with 60% saying that their leaders\nwere inclined to promote those who look, act or think like them. About 59%\nfelt the same during the hiring process.\n\nFurthermore, 72% felt unconscious bias training for leadership had a direct\nimpact on hiring more diverse talent even if only 49% of organisations\nprovided such training.\n\nOne-third of all respondents faced discrimination due to age, ethnicity,\ndisability, sexual orientation or socioeconomic background, with over half\nsaying it happened to them within the past year.\n\nWhen asked on which areas would benefit the most from diversity and inclusion\n(D&I) practices, 76% of all respondents chose company culture, 59% picked\ninnovation, and 53% voted talent retention. Organisation leadership, a\nconstant top choice, was voted out of the top three.\n\n_Photo courtesy of Pexels.com  \n _\n\nDo you know more about this story?

They tend to focus on regulating workers' behavior, often\nputting a damper on commitment, innovation, and performance without realizing\nit. But freedom and control aren't zero-sum, argues the author. By giving\npeople a clear sense of their organization's purpose, priorities, and\nprinciples--that is, by providing freedom within a galvanizing framework--\nleaders can equip employees to make on-the-ground decisions that are in the\ncompany's best interests.\n\nGulati uses businesses as diverse as Netflix, Alaska Airlines, and Warby\nParker to show how freedom can function in different settings. A coherent\nframework helps employees develop a deeper understanding of the business,\nwhich can lead to improved engagement, creativity, efficiency, and customer\nservice.\n\n#### In Brief\n\n##### The Problem\n\nMost leaders view employee freedom and operational control as antagonists in a\ntug-of-war that can have only one winner. So they tend to pour their resources\ninto regulating workers\u2019 behavior\u2014often unknowingly putting a damper on\ncommitment, innovation, and performance.\n\n##### The Solution\n\nBy giving people a clear sense of the organization\u2019s purpose, priorities, and\nprinciples\u2014that is, a galvanizing framework\u2014leaders can equip them to make\nautonomous decisions that are in the company\u2019s best interests. Employees\nshould be involved in identifying and articulating those guidelines.\n\n##### The Benefits\n\nA coherent framework helps employees develop a deeper understanding of the\nbusiness, which can boost performance on many levels, including engagement,\nquality, creativity, and customer service.\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2018/05/structure-thats-not-stifling?language=es)\n\nLeaders know they need to give people room to be their best, to pursue\nunconventional ideas, and to make smart decisions in the moment. It\u2019s been\nsaid so often that it\u2019s a cliche. But here\u2019s the problem: Executives have\ntrouble resolving the tension between employee empowerment and operational\ndiscipline. This challenge is so difficult that it ties companies up in knots.\nIndeed, it has led to decades\u2019 worth of management experiments, from [matrix\nstructures](/1990/07/matrix-management-not-a-structure-a-frame-of-mind) to\n[self-managed teams. ](/2016/07/beyond-the-holacracy-hype)None of them has\noffered a clear answer.\n\nThat may be because leaders cling to the notion that freedom and control are\nzero-sum, often oscillating between the extremes. However, in studying more\nthan a dozen organizations in a range of industries\u2014businesses as diverse as\nan entertainment company, an airline, and an e-tail start-up\u2014I\u2019ve learned that\nguidelines are not the death of freedom if they\u2019re well designed and well\nimplemented. They actually support and nurture it by giving people a clear,\npositive, galvanizing sense of where the organization is trying to go.\n\nLeaders who have made this basic but counterintuitive discovery have\nessentially cultivated freedom within a framework, embedding the\norganization\u2019s purpose, priorities, and principles in a living set of\nguidelines. Once they\u2019ve laid out the framework, they commit substantial\nresources to helping employees understand it and thrive within it.\n\nWell-designed and well-implemented guidelines are not the death of freedom.\n\n\u201cFreedom within a framework\u201d is not my phrase. Leaders I have studied use it\nto describe how they think about employee decision making, for instance, or\nhow they look at the central organization\u2019s relationship to business units or\nindividual brands. This article provides a broader definition that can be\napplied in a variety of contexts.\n\n\u201cFreedom\u201d can mean many things, but here, as a baseline, it means trusting\nemployees to think and act independently in behalf of the organization. It may\nalso include allowing them to find fulfillment and express themselves.\n\nOf course, employees\u2019 desires vary. But we know from a large body of research\non organizational behavior that most people want some form of choice and voice\nin what they do at work, and that this can spark greater commitment and\nimprove performance. Human-relations thinkers made this connection nearly a\ncentury ago, and since then management experts such as Peter Drucker, Jeffrey\nPfeffer, Richard Hackman, and Michael Beer have advanced the argument. Robert\nBurgelman and Joseph Bower have shown a relationship between autonomy (of both\nindividuals and units) and the growth of innovative ideas and ventures within\ncompanies. Kenneth W. Thomas and others have emphasized the impact that free\nchoice can have on empowerment and motivation.\n\nAny of the factors just mentioned\u2014commitment, performance, innovation\u2014would be\na compelling reason to expand employees\u2019 freedom. But consider this as well:\nWith the explosive growth of the internet and social media, people now enjoy\ninnumerable channels for sharing concerns and ideas in their personal lives.\nCompared with these expansive platforms for selfexpression, the workplace can\nfeel downright stifling. The freedom of the outside world is banging at the\ncorporate door, demanding to come inside. Yet most leaders are still afraid to\nopen it, because they continue to view freedom and frameworks as antagonists\nin an intense tug-of-war. And since a tug-of-war can have only one winner,\nthey pour their resources into regulating employee behavior.\n\n![R1803D_CROWTHER_A.jpg](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/04/R1803D_CROWTHER_A.jpg)\n\nTwo decades ago the Harvard Business School organizational theorist\nChristopher A. Bartlett and the London Business School management professor\nSumantra Ghoshal called out companies\u2019 bias toward control, arguing that\nleaders were misguided in their complaints about employees\u2019 lack of\nengagement, gumption, focus, and so on. The real issue, Bartlett and Ghoshal\nargued, was the persistent use of a simplistic, outdated organizational model\nin which leaders dream up strategy, devise a corporate structure to support\nit, and install systems to make sure employees toe the line. The result, they\nsaid, was often a work environment as enervating as Calcutta\u2019s heat in the\nsummer.\n\nLittle has changed, sadly. As the faculty chair of Harvard Business School\u2019s\nintensive on-campus Advanced Management Program for executives, I have heard\nnumerous firsthand accounts attesting to organizations\u2019 ingrained habits of\ncontrol. In one memorable conversation, an HR executive of a major U.S.\nmultinational lamented that freedom in a corporate context is, in the end, an\n\u201cimpossible dream.\u201d\n\nNetflix leaders want to give their people \u201coxygen to make mistakes.\u201d\n\nIn this article I\u2019ll share several company examples that contradict that\nassessment. These cases show what freedom in a framework looks like and how it\nfunctions in a range of settings, including the airline industry, one of the\nmost regulated and rules-laden businesses. I\u2019ll also discuss the framework\u2019s\nfragility\u2014its vulnerability to dissolution and its tendency, absent a constant\ninfusion of energy, to revert to bureaucracy.\n\n## A Richer View of Freedom: Two Cases\n\nOne of the first companies I\u2019ve seen push beyond the conventional, limited\nunderstanding of employee freedom is Netflix. The U.S.-based media company has\nreceived a lot of press for its hands-off approach to management. Its leaders\nassume that people do their best work when they don\u2019t have to ask for approval\nat every turn. One of the company\u2019s senior global executives told me that he\npersonally hates to be managed and looks for the same attitude in job\ncandidates.\n\nIn a slide deck that went viral several years ago, the company described its\nculture as [a blend of \u201cfreedom and responsibility.\u201d\n](https://jobs.netflix.com/life-at-netflix)That means employees are at liberty\nto use their own judgment within the strategic priorities articulated in\n\u201cfoundational\u201d documents, which include such things as FAQs about the\ncompany\u2019s philosophy and priorities and instructions about minimizing rules\nand valuing flexibility over efficiency.\n\nConsequently, Netflix has no shortage of employee-sparked initiatives, ranging\nfrom new film and TV content to innovative social media campaigns. The company\nlets employees [make their own choices](/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr)\nabout vacation time, maternity leave, and travel expenses, rather than looking\nto HR to impose limits. Employees are also encouraged to communicate openly\nand to argue their points of view.\n\nBut here\u2019s the twist: This freedom isn\u2019t merely there for the taking.\nEmployees are expected to exercise it, as part of their responsibility to the\norganization. For example, it\u2019s their job to read, understand, and debate the\nideas in the foundational documents. The Netflix global executive just\nmentioned said that this \u201crequires a great deal of engagement with broad\naspects of the business.\u201d Once employees grasp the company\u2019s needs at that\nlevel, they are trusted to have its best interests at heart and to behave\naccordingly. \u201cIt\u2019s rare that people abuse the trust,\u201d the executive told me.\nResearchers have pointed out that companies often specify \u201czones of\ndiscretion\u201d or \u201cspheres of influence\u201d in which employees get limited autonomy,\nbut Netflix considers virtually the entire company to be such a zone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary for us to implement control mechanisms,\u201d an HR executive\ntold me. \u201cWe want to help people learn and give them oxygen to make mistakes.\u201d\nFor example, he allows managers to hire candidates he would have rejected.\n\u201cManagers can make the bets they feel are right for the business. I could\ndisagree on a candidate, but if a manager takes my input and still makes\nanother bet, I support that bet.\u201d\n\nThis blend of freedom and responsibility has paid off at Netflix. Since its\nfounding, two decades ago, as a mail-order video-rental service, the company\nhas expanded into online streaming with more than 100 million subscribers\nworldwide, representing nearly every country. It is also increasingly\nprominent as a producer of award-winning TV and film content. The company\nattributes these successes to its empowered, committed, innovative workforce.\n\nYou might wonder whether this approach is broadly applicable. I\u2019ve asked\nmyself the same question. After all, Netflix maintains a small, exceptional\nworkforce of about 3,500 people\u2014hardly the kind of sprawling, heterogeneous\nemployee base \u201cthat requires rules to be effective,\u201d as the Netflix global\nexecutive put it. Its recruitment process is exceedingly selective, and the\npay is high. Though some companies have such recruitment and compensation\ntools at their disposal\u2014other tech-based companies, for instance, and\nprofessional services firms\u2014lower-margin businesses usually don\u2019t. What\u2019s\nmore, Netflix is in the entertainment industry, where mistakes may cost a lot\nbut don\u2019t typically endanger people\u2019s health or lives. The degree of freedom\nthat\u2019s appropriate in an entertainment or an internet company is far greater\nthan what would be tolerated in many businesses\u2014particularly those that are\nregulated and unionized\u2014so I also closely examined organizations with such\nconstraints. Here, too, I was able to find companies whose employees can still\nthink constructively, innovate, and make customer-friendly decisions on their\nown\u2014and exercise more choice and voice in their day-to-day work\u2014by\ninternalizing guidelines that complement more-conventional control systems.\n\nLet\u2019s look at Alaska Airlines, which operates in a highly regulated, safety-\nfocused, low-margin industry and has a diverse, unionized workforce. (If an\nairline can establish a coherent framework for employee freedom despite such\nconstraints, virtually any company can do the same.) Like Netflix, Alaska\nlearned that carefully designed and implemented guidelines can support and\nenrich freedom. But it took the airline a long time to get there, because its\nearly attempts weren\u2019t sufficiently rooted in the organization\u2019s needs.\n\nSome Alaska employees had the impression they could do anything for\npassengers.\n\nBack in the 1990s, Alaska was a relatively small company with a big\npersonality\u2014its workforce was friendly, informal, and eager to help. Frontline\nemployees were encouraged to make real-time decisions to better serve\ncustomers and maintain a competitive advantage. \u201cI remember being told [on\narrival in 1997], \u2018Trust your gut; do the right thing,\u2019\u201d Stacie Baker,\nAlaska\u2019s director of airport training and leadership, told me. \u201cI remember\ngiving that guidance to others as well when I became a supervisor.\u201d\n\nA senior executive informally dubbed this service philosophy Whatever It\nTakes\u2014and the growing company adopted that as its mantra. Employees were urged\nto go to great lengths to assist, appease, and even compensate passengers to\nmaintain a happy, loyal customer base. Leaders assumed\u2014or hoped\u2014that employees\nwould infuse these extraordinary efforts with an understanding of the\ncompany\u2019s interests.\n\nBut employees were never given a clear sense of those interests. Whatever It\nTakes was entirely customer-focused, and it was a sprawling philosophy. \u201cIt\ndidn\u2019t have any fences around it,\u201d says Andy Schneider, who was the vice\npresident of in-flight operations back when that philosophy ran rampant. It\ngave some employees the false impression that there were no limits on what\nthey could do for passengers.\n\nThe value of independent decision making did come through in a crisis: In\nJanuary 2000, when Flight 261 went down in the Pacific Ocean, killing all 88\npeople aboard, customer service employees sprang into action to aid families\nand others connected to the victims. The company dispatched a team of 600\nemployees, equipped them with company credit cards, and authorized them to\narrange for hotel rooms, babysitters, and whatever else those affected might\nneed. \u201cVirtually anything that needs to happen, we will do it,\u201d Jeff Butler,\nan Alaska Airlines executive, said at the time.\n\nHowever, the crash also set off a cultural shift at Alaska. The company\ncurtailed its growth plan and intensified its focus on safety, appointing a\nsafety vice president and hiring some 200 additional maintenance workers.\n\nThen\u2014less than two years later, after the terrorist attacks of September\n11\u2014demand for air travel plummeted, and security costs increased. In 2001\nAlaska Airlines lost $43 million. That year U.S. airlines went from\nsubstantial profitability to a combined net loss of nearly $8 billion, despite\nan emergency infusion of close to $4 billion in government support. Meanwhile,\nAlaska\u2019s on-time performance had become poor, threatening customer\nsatisfaction.\n\nIn addressing the intense pressure for safety, cost, and performance\nimprovements, Alaska made the conventional assumption about trade-offs between\nfreedom and control. \u201cThe world being uncertain, we became more disciplined,\u201d\nStacie Baker said when we spoke. This is a common response to a crisis or a\n[downturn. ](/2010/03/roaring-out-of-recession)Unfortunately, as the airline\nclamped down, it snuffed out decision autonomy. For instance, a few years\nlater, to improve safety and boost on-time results, it created a heavily\nscripted departure-and-arrival \u201cplaybook.\u201d Efficiency increased, and net\nprofits did rise\u2014from $138 million in 2006 to $571 million in 2014. But gate\nand flight attendants and other frontline workers were using less and less\ndiscretion to solve problems. Despite older workers\u2019 informal attempts to pass\nalong the company\u2019s customer-centric traditions, newcomers felt uncomfortable\nmaking judgment calls in ambiguous situations and tended to be rigid about\npreserving the airline\u2019s on-time record. They \u201cwere afraid that if they didn\u2019t\nprecisely follow the policies, they would get in trouble,\u201d Ben Minicucci,\nAlaska Airlines\u2019 president and COO, told me. Customer-service numbers began to\nslip, and competitors were catching up. As Baker explained, other airlines\n\u201cwere raising their game, but we were status quo.\u201d\n\nWhen leaders solicited feedback from the front lines, they learned that the\nbureaucracy was tying employees\u2019 hands and creating frustration. So in 2014\nand 2015, in hopes of winning again on superior customer service, Alaska\nreturned to its culture of frontline autonomy. But this time the company took\na serious look at decision boundaries. How should they be drawn? If it was\npermissible, say, to delay takeoff while a passenger ran back into the\nterminal to fetch a forgotten item, was it also permissible to lavish gifts on\npassengers to make up for delays? The answer would turn out to be no. The\ncompany saw that providing consistently excellent service while adhering to\nregulations and maintaining the gains in efficiency would require independent\ndecision making\u2014but within well-understood limits.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the Disney Institute\u2019s \u201cfour keys\u201d to a great\ncustomer experience, Alaska\u2019s leadership team defined four standards of\nservice: safety, caring, delivery, and presentation. Within each standard it\nprovided broad guidelines for employees\u2019 attitudes and behaviors.\n\nAlaska had discovered that the frontline employee\u2014the worker \u201con the spot,\u201d in\nthe economist Friedrich Hayek\u2019s terminology\u2014must be given enough knowledge to\nalign his or her decisions with the organization\u2019s needs and plans. So the\nairline developed a comprehensive training program with an explicit goal of\nhelping frontline employees internalize its service standards. The company\u2019s\ntop executives attended the training to underscore its importance. In a\nmuseumlike space designed for an immersive experience, they talked about\nAlaska\u2019s core beliefs and history, and employees were shown artifacts such as\nuniforms dating to the 1940s to convey the arc of the company\u2019s story and to\nunderscore the idea that future success would stem from long-held customer-\ncentric values. They learned about the company\u2019s financial standing and its\nsustainability plan as well. The training made clear that frontline workers\nwere essential to beating low-cost carriers and big legacy rivals, including\nDelta, which had gained traction on Alaska\u2019s home turf in Seattle. They also\nlearned how the company was evaluated by J.D. Power and other raters and where\nit stood in relation to competitors.\n\nFurther training sessions, reinforced with videos, helped employees understand\ntheir decisionmaking power and how it related to the company\u2019s goals and\nservice standards. One video, in which an agent waived a fee for a passenger\nwhose travel plans had to be changed because of an injury, illustrated that\nemployees were expected to make thoughtful choices on their own.\n\nSome workers were skeptical, concerned that moving away from a purely rules-\nbased approach would hurt on-time performance. The company assured employees\nthat it wanted them to experiment and would support them in their decisions.\nManagers, too, had to be retrained\u2014many were initially uncomfortable ceding\ndecision authority to their direct reports. They also needed guidance on\nhaving constructive conversations with subordinates who went a little too far\nfor customers. The goal was to help employees grow from the experience, not to\npunish them for well-intended choices or make them afraid to use their\ndiscretion in the future.\n\nSo far the results have been positive: In 2017 Alaska earned J.D. Power\u2019s\nhighest customer satisfaction ranking among traditional airlines. The\ncompany\u2019s continuing position as a low-cost leader\u2014it has been ranked at the\ntop of the 15 biggest U.S. airlines in fuel efficiency, for example\u2014suggests\nthat Alaska is also achieving other performance goals. It has been listed by\nFlightStats as the most on-time airline in North America for seven consecutive\nyears, and according to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s domestic-airline rankings,\nfor four years in a row it has had the best on-time performance and the fewest\ntarmac delays and complaints.\n\nIn addition, the training has had the unanticipated effect of improving\nrelations among staff members. \u201cIf you\u2019ve ever worked in a union environment,\nthere\u2019s a lot of paranoia, a lot of misinformation,\u201d Andy Schneider explained\nto me. \u201cIt was healthy for employees to hear, \u2018Hey, we don\u2019t always get it\nright, but we\u2019re committed to this. We\u2019re committed to you. And we need you in\norder to win.\u2019\u201d\n\n## Defining the Framework\n\nIn a groundbreaking series of HBR articles in the 1990s (including [\u201cChanging\nthe Role of Top Management: Beyond Systems to People,\u201d](/1995/05/changing-the-\nrole-of-top-management-beyond-systems-to-people) May\u2013June 1995), Bartlett and\nGhoshal offered an antidote to the strategy-structure-systems thinking that\ngives rise, again and again, to oppressive workplace controls: Companies, they\nsaid, need to shift to a model built on an engaging corporate purpose,\neffective management processes that encourage individual initiative, and a\npeople policy focused on developing employees\u2019 capabilities rather than on\nmonitoring their behavior. They suggested that employee motivation would grow\nout of a \u201cstrong central framework\u201d embodying the company\u2019s vision.\n\nSimple principles help people select reasonable options in their day-to-day\nwork.\n\nThe advice is eminently well founded but has proved hard to implement, because\nit leaves some big questions unanswered: How should companies translate\npurpose into action? How can they encourage initiative and de-emphasize\nmonitoring without causing chaos? What, exactly, is a framework, and how does\nit function? So I am proposing some refinements to Bartlett and Ghoshal\u2019s\nmodel, to make it more user-friendly. I, too, have identified three core\nelements.\n\nFirst, as Bartlett and Ghoshal also argued, a company needs to articulate its\n_purpose_ \u2014a single shared goal that sums up the \u201cwhy\u201d of the organization.\nThis conveys how the company makes sense of the world and brings stakeholders\ntogether in a common cause. The purpose gives direction and meaning to\neverything the company and its employees do. Employees often adopt it as their\nown reason to work for the organization.\n\nTo develop a purpose and articulate it in a way that would resonate with\nworkers, Alaska put together a team of two dozen high-performing and widely\nrespected frontline employees and eight managers. They ultimately described\nAlaska\u2019s purpose as going above and beyond to create \u201cpersonal connections and\nextraordinary journeys.\u201d\n\nOn its own, a statement like that is pretty lofty. It needs to be tethered to\nreality by established _priorities_ \u2014behavioral rules that reflect the\norganization\u2019s goals. Spelling out the company\u2019s interests enables employees\nto act in those interests and use time and other resources wisely. Alaska\nAirlines explicitly ranked its four standards of service in priority order,\nwith safety outweighing caring, which outweighed delivery, which outweighed\npresentation. \u201cGoing above and beyond\u201d translates into going an \u201cextra inch\u201d\nfor customers without sacrificing safety or efficiency. \u201cIf we all give an\ninch, all those inches turn into a mile,\u201d Baker said.\n\nFinally, a simple set of _principles,_ growing out of the organization\u2019s\npurpose and priorities, helps employees choose among reasonable options in\ntheir day-to-day work. A principle should apply to more than one situation\u2014it\nshould facilitate decisions in an array of contexts. That said, it shouldn\u2019t\nbe so broad that it provides no real guidance. Take the statement \u201cAll\nemployees must be treated with respect.\u201d Although that is a laudable aim, what\ndoes it look like in practice? Better to describe behaviors that convey\nrespect, such as encouraging people to express their opinions freely or even\nrewarding them for doing so. Principles can also be constructed out of\nbusiness choices, such as infusing innovation efforts with design thinking or\nfocusing on the needs of international or middle-market customers.\n\nPrinciples, then, can include positive guidelines for action as well as limits\non behavior. And ideally, they, along with purpose and priorities, will be\niteratively defined and tweaked, with feedback from people at all levels of\nthe organization. Otherwise the framework won\u2019t make sense in practice, won\u2019t\nreflect the company\u2019s interests, or will lack consistency. Alaska\u2019s Whatever\nIt Takes campaign had all three problems.\n\nBy contrast, the company\u2019s 2014 initiative drew heavily on the experience and\nwisdom of both leaders and frontline workers. The team of employees and\nmanagers who had articulated Alaska\u2019s purpose, priorities, and four key\nservice standards met every few weeks over several months to define the\nairline\u2019s principles. Executives occasionally came in to receive briefings and\nprovide feedback. One, for instance, challenged the idea of including \u201cI\ncomply with company standard uniforms\u201d as a principle within the\n\u201cpresentation\u201d standard, because it seemed unnecessarily specific. But the\nteam insisted on the importance of the guideline, so it stayed in.\n\nIt\u2019s critical to listen to frontline workers even when their views conflict\nwith senior management\u2019s. That is what connects the framework to practice and\nhelps legitimize it in employees\u2019 eyes. Though I happen to agree with the\nexecutive who thought the line about uniforms was too granular, it will be up\nto managers and employees to sort that out in future conversations about the\nframework\u2014after they\u2019ve lived with it and applied it.\n\n![R1803D_CROWTHER_B.jpg](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/04/R1803D_CROWTHER_B.jpg)\n\nWhen I meet with business leaders, sometimes an analogy helps me explain how\npurpose, priorities, and principles enable freedom. I point to an intrepid\ngroup of improv actors known as [the Improvised Shakespeare\nCompany.](http://improvisedshakespeare.com/) The ISC takes audience\nsuggestions for titles (usually ridiculous ideas, such as The Knave\u2019s\nPantaloons) and, in real time, creates Shakespearean mini-dramas to fit them.\nIt\u2019s evident that the players have all acquired a deep knowledge of\nShakespeare\u2019s themes, characters, and language, as well as an understanding of\nwhat\u2019s required to keep audiences engaged and coming back for more. They have\nso fully internalized the troupe\u2019s purpose (to entertain), priorities (to be\nhilarious and interactive), and principles (situations and dialogue must feel\nauthentically Shakespearean) that they can improvise with dizzying\ninventiveness without sacrificing coherence. Similarly, in a business\nenvironment the purpose provides the motivation, the priorities and principles\nprovide the knowledge, and together the three elements support superior\njudgment in the moment.\n\n## Implementing the Framework\n\nTrusting employees to implement the framework generally works well. But it\u2019s\nuseful to put some checks and balances in place, as the internet-era eyewear\nretailer Warby Parker has done.\n\nBefore we look at how, let\u2019s consider some background: Warby Parker is a\nrelatively small, young start-up\u2014at the time of this writing it had been\naround for just seven years and was still running on venture capital. Though\nit has opened more than 60 physical stores, in other ways it resembles\nNetflix: It\u2019s a web-based company that has a \u201chome try-on\u201d program, and it has\nused a highly selective hiring process to grow its workforce (currently\nnumbering about 1,300). Its employees have considerable freedom to voice their\nideas and concerns, whether by engaging in honest conversation, participating\nin 360-degree reviews, or proposing new initiatives.\n\nAs at the other companies I\u2019ve mentioned, employees\u2019 freedom exists within a\nwell-defined framework: The company\u2019s purpose is to \u201cdo good\u201d (for example,\nthrough partnerships with nonprofits, Warby ensures that for every pair of\nglasses sold, a pair is distributed to someone in need). As for priorities,\nthe company has developed a system in which 30-plus senior managers cast\n\u201cWarbles\u201d (weighted votes) on employee-proposed projects related to\nengineering. The more Warbles something gets, the stronger the indication of\npriority. But in practice the rankings function as preferences, not direct\norders. Engineers may disregard the vote-based priorities and instead work on\nprojects that best fit their skills, interests, and views regarding what will\nbenefit the company most.\n\nIt\u2019s a democratic system, but one in which the people doing the work have a\ndegree of decision power\u2014within established boundaries. The system serves\nbroader functional and philosophical purposes, too: In encouraging proposers\nto seek support for their ideas, it fosters widespread conversations,\nunderscoring the company\u2019s principle of valuing both consensus and autonomy.\n\nOf course, a critical part of implementation is learning from missteps. As\nlarge engineering projects unfold, Warby Parker holds periodic \u201cretrospective\u201d\nconversations with relevant stakeholders\u2014including managers outside\nengineering\u2014to capture learning about what\u2019s going right or wrong. For\nexample, during a commercial foray into Canada, participants discussed why\nthey hadn\u2019t realized until late in the game that a local bank card was\nincompatible with the company\u2019s payment system. Conversations about such\nmissteps are structured to cover not only what could have gone better but also\n\u201cWhat\u2019s still an open question\u2014what still puzzles us?\u201d according to Andrew\nJaico, a Warby Parker technical product manager.\n\n## The Fragility of a Framework\n\nAt numerous companies freedom frameworks (or proto-frameworks\u2014that is, less-\ndeveloped ones) have fallen apart. Why does that happen?\n\nThe short answer is that a framework, like freedom itself, is inherently\nfragile. It requires maintenance. You can\u2019t expect it to last unless you\nprovide constant infusions of energy. So one major risk is neglect. People\nmust maintain an explicit awareness of the company\u2019s purpose, priorities, and\nprinciples. If those elements fade from managers\u2019 and employees\u2019\nconsciousness, the framework is in jeopardy. The same will be true if the\ncompany brings in a host of new employees\u2014say, through a merger or an\nacquisition\u2014but doesn\u2019t immerse them in the guidelines.\n\nAnother risk is that new leaders will fail to support the framework because\nthey don\u2019t grasp its value. Or\u2014probably even more common\u2014the leaders who\nestablished it may turn around and deliberately take away some employee\nfreedoms for one of these reasons:\n\n### Reaction to a crisis.\n\nAfter a major shock, leaders tend to lurch into big changes when a better\napproach might be to maintain a steady course while increasing the\norganization\u2019s learning. Alaska Airlines\u2019 suppression of employee freedom when\nrevenue and performance were declining provides an example of this pendulum\neffect.\n\n### Reaction to success.\n\nSometimes freedom-fueled performance is followed by a period of inflexibility,\nas was the case at Nokia. In the 1970s CEO Kari Kairamo had downplayed\ntraditional formalities and processes in favor of speed and agility, thereby\npropelling the company into the electronics and telecom markets that would\neventually yield its greatest wins. Yet a little over a decade after the\ncompany reached its peak, in the late 1990s, Nokia underwent a shift toward\nbureaucracy. My Harvard Business School colleagues Juan Alcacer and Tarun\nKhanna [found in their research ](/product/the-rise-and-fall-of-\nnokia/714428-PDF-ENG)that as the company rapidly grew, it was unable to adapt\nto all the distinct challenges in different global markets. In many instances\nheadquarters ignored or responded too slowly to requests from subsidiaries.\nNokia ceded market share to both low- and high-end competing products.\n\nLike freedom itself, a framework is inherently fragile. It requires\nmaintenance.\n\n### The primacy of process.\n\nIn some organizations, rules for how to do the work assume too much\nimportance, and people toil away without autonomy or any understanding of why.\nEven in industries such as health care and pharmaceuticals, where employees\noften share a strong sense of their organizations\u2019 purpose, process can\novertake meaning. A VP at one global pharma company told me that customer-\nfacing employees fundamentally love what they do\u2014\u201cour values are alive\u201d\u2014but\n\u201cthe head office imposes so many restrictions on compliance, training, and\nrules of engagement to cover our risk that employees can hardly maneuver.\u201d\n\nGiven these sources of fragility, companies need to constantly monitor\nemployee voices and look for signs of declining agency. Is there real\ndiversity among workers\u2019 expressed viewpoints? Is there significant variation\nin the kinds of projects people are undertaking? Even the best-designed\nfreedom frameworks must be reinforced through education, executive example,\nand rigorous after-action discussion.\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nAfter Alaska Airlines acquired Virgin America, the once-small regional carrier\nbecame the fifth-largest airline in the United States by traffic. The merger\nbrought in 3,000 additional employees, all of whom would require training in\nAlaska\u2019s approach to customer service. The acquisition increased the challenge\nregarding employee freedom. As COO Ben Minicucci put it: \u201cHow can I make sure\n20,000 people feel connected to management, that they embrace our purpose?\u201d To\ncomplicate matters, Virgin had its own, less-formal freedom framework. It had\nfewer explicit guidelines and went further than Alaska in encouraging\nemployees to express their personalities and interests at work. The\nacquisition has pushed Alaska into making refinements to embrace elements of\nVirgin\u2019s purpose and values.\n\nStress tests like Virgin\u2019s integration\u2014and Netflix\u2019s rapid expansion into new\nmarkets, and Warby Parker\u2019s long-range goal of becoming an international\ncorporation\u2014occur against a backdrop of expanded freedom in employees\u2019\npersonal lives.

Firms are also\nexpected to be less receptive to salary negotiation efforts.\n\n\"This more conservative approach to hiring and compensation comes as many\ncompanies realise that costs are increasing disproportionately to revenue\ngrowth,\" the report noted.\n\nFurther, in some rare cases where firms are under extreme cost pressures, they\nmay even consider a salary cut for new hires.\n\nHiring of replacement headcount as companies lose employees is also expected\nto slow down, with functions and roles being absorbed into existing teams\ninstead, partly to keep manpower costs low.\n\nFor Singaporean candidates, they could become more concerned about job\nsecurity and an organisation's financial stability, although they can still be\nlured by factors like growth opportunities and better compensation packages.\n\nA shift to a larger contingent workforce is also expected to continue in 2020,\nas organisations deal with cost pressures, organisational change,\nrestructuring and digitalisation. Younger workers have also been observed to\nbe more attracted to an early career in contracting.\n\n\"Besides allowing them to build an impressive portfolio of acquired technical\nand soft skills, contracting also gives them the flexibility and freedom to\npursue personal goals such as longer travel plans, side hustles and other\npersonal aspirations,\" the report added.\n\nDo you know more about this story?

The Lion City also ranked poorly on workforce with\nsecondary education and population with secondary education (69th in both\ncases).\n\n**Also read** : [Singapore still trails Switzerland in talent\ncompetitiveness](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/in-focus/singapore-still-\ntrails-switzerland-in-talent-competitiveness)\n\nA study conducted by Robert Half found that nearly half (49%) of Singapore's\nfinancial employers have had an employee resign during their probation period\ndue to poor onboarding processes, with 27% losing the employees during their\nfirst month.\n\n\"In today's candidate-short market, too many business leaders sometimes forget\nit's not only about attracting and securing talent, but also retaining them,\nthereby highlighting the importance of helping the employee kick-start their\ncareer in the best possible way thanks to an efficient onboarding process,\"\n**Matthieu Imbert-Bouchard** , managing director of Robert Half Singapore,\ntold _Singapore Business Review_.\n\nThis sentiment was shared by **Linda Teo** , country manager for ManpowerGroup\nSingapore, who noted that the subsequent lack of engagement efforts by\nmanagers after the fanfare of attracting employees can make workers feel like\nthey are commodities instead of humans. \"Relying on human resources (HR)\ndepartment to engage staff is insufficient. Engagement needs to be more\ntargeted and personalised to be effective. Employers should also equip line\nmanagers with the skills required to engage employees as they are working\ndirectly with them to complement HR's efforts,\" she explained.\n\nHowever, Teo noted that a one-size-fits-all approach to engage employees will\nhave little effect, as Singapore's workforce consists of employees from\ndifferent generations.  \"Companies' traditional approach to managing the\nworkplace as a homogenous entity is no longer effective. With increasing life\nexpectancy and retirement age, companies will have employees from four to five\ndifferent generations,\" she highlighted. \"Whilst employers may balk at the\nhigher cost of customising retention initiatives to target different\ngenerations, this will outweigh the benefits of having an engaged workforce.\"\n\nImbert-Bouchard agreed, pointing out that companies who lose new recruits\nduring their probation period not only have to start the recruitment process\nfrom scratch, but also have to deal with the associated costs of lost\nproductivity and low team morale amongst employees who most likely have to\nmanage the additional workload.\n\nAdditionally, losing employees that early on does not increase the standing of\nthe company as an employer of choice to potential new applicants, potentially\nimpacting the wider attractiveness of the business.\n\nBut due to the favourable market conditions for top talent in Singapore and\nthe low unemployment rate, skilled candidates know they are in demand and\noften receive job offers from competing organisations who offer not only a\nhigher salary, but also lifestyle benefits such as flexible working\narrangements.\n\n\"Finding out what motivates and drives every employee is one of the key\ncornerstones of an effective policy. Retention is a business priority that\nneeds a certain level of individualisation and continuous improvement\nefforts.staff retention is primarily the responsibility of the employer as\nthey need to identify the main catalysts that benefit retention within their\norganisation, build and implement a policy around it, communicate their\npolicy, as well as address staff turnover when it occurs,\" he underlined.\n\nAn independently-conducted Robert Half survey amongst 500 Singaporean\njobseekers found that one in four (25%) Singaporean office workers would leave\ntheir current organisation to get a better work-life balance, followed closely\nby 24% who refer to financial rewards and 23% citing career development.\nAnother 16% refer to management/leadership and 5% to co-workers as being the\nprimary reason why they would leave the organisation.\n\n**Also read** : [Horrible bosses? 1 in 3 Singaporeans are not satisfied with\nwork-life balance due to inflexible managers](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-\neducation/news/horrible-bosses-1-in-3-singaporeans-are-not-satisfied-work-\nlife-balance-due-inflex)\n\nWhilst salary remained a significant part of a remuneration package in\nSingapore and companies realise that they have to offer above-average salary\npackages to both attract and retain high-calibre professionals, there has been\na steady shift of preferences from jobseekers who are looking for more work-\nlife balance, with some even prioritising non-financial incentives other than\njust a higher salary.\n\nCompanies looking to attract and retain top performers need to consider other\nnon-financial incentives, such as workplace flexibility and the option to work\nfrom home, especially if they are not in a position to award pay increases or\nabove-average salary rates, Imbert-Bouchard noted.\n\n\"Employees, however, also carry some of the responsibility as they are advised\nto address any issues with their employer that might cause them to leave the\ncompany,\" he explained. \"Regularly communicating and being transparent about\nthe company's retention efforts, and developing open lines of communication\nwhile demonstrating the flexibility to address potential concerns are all key\nelements to successful employee retention.\"\n\nDo you know more about this story?

The survey\nalso covers seven other markets across Asia, including mainlandChina,\nMalaysia, Hong Kong, Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam and Thailand.\n\nAward winners included Avnet Asia Pte Ltd, Borouge Pte Ltd, Centurion\nCorporation Limited, Mundipharma Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd, Oracle Corporate\nSingapore Pte Ltd, SAS Institute Pte Ltd and TWG Tea Company Pte Ltd.\n\n\"The HR Asia Best Companies to Work for in Asiais the only programme in the\nmarket that relies 100% on the input of employees across three key factors:\nemotional engagement (heart), intention and motivation (mind) and behaviour\nand advocacy (soul),\" says Dato' William Ng, Group Publisher / Editor-in-Chief\nof Business Media International, the publishers of HR Asia.\n\n **GOOD EMPLOYERS SCORE HIGHER**\n\nSurvey participants were asked affirmative statements about their employers,\nand either agree or disagree with each of the statements. Based on these\nanswers across the survey, the top 3 areas that employees in Singapore agree\nabout their jobs are:\n\n* Meeting or exceeding customer expectation (Average score of 4.44/5) \n* Employees always seeking a better way to improve their efficiency at work (Average score of 4.31/5) \n* Employees willing to go for the extra mile if I can contribute to the success of the organisation (Average score of 4.30/5)\n\nOn the other hand, the 3 areas that score the lowest in the survey (i.e. the\nones which the employees feel their companies can improve on) are:\n\n* Employees feel that they do not really know what is going on in the organisation (3.55/5) \n* Employees feel that they do not get supported by the companies in pursuing their own professional development (Average score of 3.68/5) \n* Employees feel that they are not involved in the decision-making process (Average score of 3.70/5)\n\nWith few exceptions, all the winning companies scored significantly higher in\nthese areas compared to other participants. This indicates that employers that\nare more transparent, supportive of employees' growth and lead by example, are\nmore likely to be rated as a good workplace by their own employees.\n\n**WHAT EMPLOYERS THINK**\n\nThe survey also obtained employers' input on their employees.\n\n94% of the companies surveyed felt that they conducted regular performance\nappraisals. Appraisals bring employers and employees together to discuss and\nidentify work responsibilities while correcting weaknesses and recognising\ngood performance.\n\n93.8% of the participating companies felt that safety was top priority in\ntheir respective companies. It is essential for employees to have a safe\nenvironment in which they will be comfortable to work in and for employers to\nprovide this necessary safety with regards to operation, procedures and\npolicies. A safe workplace is conducive in creating positive productivity\nwhere employees not only perform better but also feel they matter to their\norganisation.\n\n\"HR Asia is Asia's largest circulating publication for HR professionals. We\ntake our role as a catalyst of the industry very seriously. To be the best in\nnot easy, but how do we remain as the best? As we compete regionally for\ntalents, it is crucial that we maintain industry and market leading workplace\npractices and employee engagement initiatives,\" Dato' William Ng shared.\n\n**WORDS OF WISDOM**\n\nEchoing words of the triumphant winners of the HR Asia Best Companies to Work\nfor in Asia Awards 2018, we cite few of the more inspiring pieces:\n\n\"Avnet Asia's journey is one of continuous improvement and we strive for\nhigher goals with each milestone that we achieved.

It's an exciting time: What\nstarted as just a few dots on a tiny organizational chart has quickly\nballooned into multiple sections and departments.\n\nAs the startup grows, so does its need for a designated HR department. That's\nwhere Nikki comes in. She must determine how activities within the HR\ndepartment will be organized, controlled and coordinated.\n\nSound like a fun challenge? It certainly is. For startup owners and HR\ndecision-makers like Nikki, here are three innovative ways to structure a\nsuccessful HR department from the ground up:  \n\n##  **1\\. Hire for people operations.**\n\nWhen people think \"people operations,\" Google usually comes to mind. The tech\ngiant pioneered this data-based approach to human resources, and today's most\ncutting-edge startups are following suit (as is the case with many things\nGoogle does).\n\nWhat makes people operations different from traditional HR? For starters,\npeople operations is more than just human resources -- it's a data-based\napproach to understanding a company's most valuable asset: its people. Most\nimportantly, this approach to HR is based on retaning employees by\nunderstanding what drives them.  \n\nWhen it comes to employees, eliminate the guesswork from employee satisfaction\nsurveys, team assessments and social media. By having a dedicated team to\nsolicit employee-related data, HR can more accurately identify issues that\nlead to disengagement and attrition, and thereby prevent it.\n\n **Related:  [Google's Head of HR: It Doesn't Matter Where Candidates Went to\nCollege](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/244973)**\n\n##  **2\\. Boost a small team with big software.**\n\nFor small businesses with even smaller human resources teams, HR professionals\noften have to juggle multiple roles, from recruiter to talent manager to\naccountant. In an effort to put the \"human\" back in human resources, companies\ntoday are choosing to automate particular HR tasks to make notoriously tedious\nprocesses easier for both employers and employees.\n\nBy automating time-consuming administrative HR functions, such as payroll,\nlegal or benefits administration, there's more time to spend interacting with\nand managing employees. In this way, technology can literally put the human\nback in human resources. For companies with a small but growing HR team,\nsoftware picks up the slack to make a small team feel super human.\n\n **Related:  [A New Wave of HR Technology Is Disrupting the\nMarket](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/246459)**\n\n##  **3\\. Adopt a business partner model.**\n\nCompanies that adopt this HR model rely on much more than your average HR\ngeneralist. In the HR business partner model, designated employees -- business\npartners -- from the human resources department work closely with the\ncompany's senior leaders to develop an HR agenda that closely supports the\noverall company mission.\n\nHR business partnering is becoming increasingly popular, as companies place\nmore focus on aligning individual agendas toward common company goals. The\nbusiness partner model requires HR to be more involved in almost every aspect\nof business, from financial status to sale projections to production\nstatistics -- you name it.\n\nRather than acting as the silent partner within an organization, business\npartners play an active role within the company. This integration of HR and\nother business functions makes it easy to identify, develop and align\nemployees. And that's smart business.\n\n **Related:  **[ **17 Great HR Resources for\nEntrepreneurs**](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/241347)\n\n##  More from Entrepreneur\n\n[ ![Sign up now to Entrepreneur Press: Book of the\nWeek](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20191004063004-EP-BOTW-Promo-\nImage-2000x1334.jpg?format=jpg&width=700&crop=16:9)\n](https://www.entrepreneur.com/subscribe/botw)\n\nGet heaping discounts to books you love delivered straight to your inbox.\nWe\u2019ll feature a different book each week and share exclusive deals you won\u2019t\nfind anywhere else.\n\n[ Sign Up Now ](https://www.entrepreneur.com/subscribe/botw)\n\n[ ![Jumpstart Your Business with Entrepreneur\nInsider](https://assets.entrepreneur.com/static/20190601122201-Insider-Bottom-\nArticle-Promo-v4a.jpg?format=jpg&width=700&crop=16:9)\n](https://www.entrepreneur.com/insider/learn-more)\n\nJumpstart Your Business.

minute Read\n\nThere was a time not long ago when \"getting HR involved\" generally meant\ndiffusing an employee relations issue. Twentieth-century HR was all about\ncontrol, enforcing compliance around hiring, training, development,\nperformance, talent management, culture, holiday parties, facilities, and\nmore. The HR function was generally reactive rather than strategic.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nTimes have changed. The rise of [21st-century\nHR](https://www.fastcompany.com/3045829/welcome-to-the-new-era-of-human-\nresources) has given birth to a new breed of HR executive, with a much broader\n[skill set](https://www.fastcompany.com/90206307/four-job-skills-the-hr-\nleaders-of-the-future-will-need), who is leading the transformation of what's\npossible in the field and reinventing HR as a [data-driven strategic\nfunction](https://www.fastcompany.com/90205539/moneyball-for-business-how-ai-\nis-changing-talent-management) critical to an organization's success.\n\nThis shift removes some of the us versus them friction that framed HR as an\noutlier to the business functions and embraces a new approach based on\npartnership, accountability, and shared outcomes.\n\nYou can trace the tipping point of this shift back to the creation of one\nparticular position: the HR business partner role. Rather than keeping HR\nisolated as a centralized team, this model embedded HR practitioners inside\nthe business functions they support, allowing them to integrate more deeply\ninto business units.\n\nThese embedded relationships allowed HR executives to have a much clearer view\non an organization's health, turnover risks, and culture shifts-enabling them\nto be more proactive in addressing challenges and developing people strategies\nmore closely aligned with the organization's mission and goals.\n\nContemporary HR is more focused on providing strategic value to drive business\noutcomes. The focus is less on control and ownership, and more on\nunderstanding and aligning the people strategy to business goals, supporting\nand empowering the employees to do their best work.\n\nHere is a look at several organizations with HR practices that reflect this\nshift in approach.\n\nadvertisement\n\n## Square\n\nIn ultra-competitive Silicon Valley, the battle for talent is legendary. If\nhiring, talent development, and retention aren't priorities for the executive\nteam, you have little chance of success.\n\nFew know this better than [Bryan\nPower](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryanpower/), a veteran HR executive who\nled global people teams at Google, Square, and Yahoo. Early in his career,\nPower worked for a product executive at Google who assigned strategic HR\noutcomes to each of his direct reports-hiring to one person, talent management\nto another, employee communications to a third, etc. This created a structure\nthat made each leader accountable for the development of the global\norganization.\n\nLater, at Square, Power implemented a similar ownership mentality as the\ncompany designed programs and built processes to scale out of the startup\nphase. Like most fast-growing tech companies, Square had many new managers who\nwere quickly expanding into leadership roles for the first time.\n\nPower understood that their success would be largely driven by his team's\nability to get them trained as managers as quickly as possible. He also\nunderstood that for these new managers to take this development challenge\nseriously and invest the right amount of time and commitment, it had to be\ndriven by the top.\n\nSo Power and his team enlisted the company's top executives including Square's\nCEO and key members of the executive team to teach manager training modules.\n\"When managers think of these people challenges as their own issues to\nresolve, rather than issues for HR to solve,\" Power says, \"that ownership and\naccountability transforms the organization.\"\n\n## Mattel\n\nWhat can an iconic 73-year-old toy manufacturer show us about progressive HR?\nQuite a lot.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLast year Mattel brought in a new chief people officer to transform its\norganization and modernize capabilities. [Amy\nThompson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-thompson-304708/), an HR veteran\nwith leadership roles at Starbucks and Ticketmaster, was lured from her\nposition as Toms's chief people officer to lead an HR transformation effort\nwithin the organization.\n\nShe brought with her a new leader-led model of HR, where managers are given\nthe tools and support to evaluate the talent and capability health of their\norganizations and then develop the people strategy alongside their HR business\npartners.\n\nThis shift toward collaborative talent mapping put the planning focus on\nleaders as opposed to HR. The human resource team provided a general\nframework, then let the business design the organizational structure that best\nserved that unit's goals and deliverables. They also translated their values\ninto behaviors needed at each level of the organization.\n\nManagers are then empowered to weave these behaviors throughout the employee\nexperience life cycle. This shift put the onus on managers to own their\nemployee's experience end to end and allowed HR to focus on more strategic\ninitiatives to support the business.\n\n\"Especially in a creative industry like ours, talent core and inseparable from\nour corporate and brand strategies, so we need our leaders to own both,\"\nThompson says. \"This allows the HR role to become a more consultative function\nwith a much higher business impact than in the past.\"\n\n## Equinox\n\nHow does a human resources team at a high-growth company ensure employees in\nthe field are supported? That's the daily challenge faced by Equinox SVP of\nPeople Services, [Kelly Rew-\nPorter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellypaulporter/).\n\nadvertisement\n\nAs Equinox continues to grow (currently at 95 clubs across the U.S., Canada,\nand London), HR had to find a way to partner with field operations. The People\nServices teams create the frameworks for HR services spanning compliance,\nrecruiting, training, and development and then work directly with their\ngeneral managers and field leaders to implement them locally.\n\nOne of the core advantages driving this adoption is that all of their GMs are\nhired from within, so their familiarity with the operational standards,\nculture, HR practices, and programs allows for autonomy and continuity.\n\n\"The perception of the role of HR is changing,\" Rew-Porter says. \"It used to\nbe 'why is HR in the room,' now it's 'why isn't HR in the room.'\"\n\nAs more organizations shift toward a 21st-century model of HR, the very nature\nof the function will begin to blend and integrate more into the business\nitself. Relinquishing control may feel counterproductive to legacy HR, but\nceding it may actually be the key to unleashing the people team's full\npotential-and impact.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\n#### About the author\n\nLars Schmidt is the founder of [Amplify](https://amplifytalent.com/), an HR\nexecutive search and consulting firm that helps companies like Hootsuite, NPR,\nand SpaceX navigate the future of work.

Baron October 23, 2018\n\nInspired by research by Prof. James Baron, the founders of the biotech firm\nAgBiome created a company with no managers, run by committees of passionately\ncommitted employees. _Yale Insights_ talked with Baron about what the\ncompany\u2019s example tells us about leadership and organizational structure.\n\n  * [__Leadership](/categories/leadership)\n\n* * *\n\nVideo of James Baron: Can a Company Succeed without a Hierarchy?\n\n\u201cJust treat people as adults.\u201d This shouldn\u2019t be a radical HR policy, but\nperhaps it is. Eric Ward, the co-founder of AgBiome, an agriculture-focused\nbiotech firm in North Carolina\u2019s research triangle, describes it as a core\nvalue for the start-up. \u201cWhat happens in traditional companies is that there\nare a set of incentives put out there that indicate to people that they are\nnot trusted to be proactive and solve problems on their own,\u201d he says in a\nrecent Yale case study. \u201cThe trite way of putting that would be people are\nassumed to be lazy and stupid.\u201d\n\nHaving hired capable people, AgBiome puts them in charge of their own work.\nThere isn\u2019t a layer of managers making decisions at the firm, or even a list\nof job titles; rather, there\u2019s an expectation that teams will \u201cself-assemble\naround solving a problem.\u201d Committees of employees oversee finance, business\ndevelopment, investor relations, and compensation.\n\n* * *\n\n##### [Learn more about the Yale SOM case study\n\u201cAgBiome.\u201d](/case/2018/agbiome)\n\n* * *\n\n[The company\u2019s unusual structure began with an article in the _California\nManagement\nReview_](https://cmr.berkeley.edu/search/articleDetail.aspx?article=4776). It\ndescribed five organizational blueprints and the impacts associated with each.\nWhile each model had examples of positive outcomes, the data showed that\n\u201ccommitment\u201d model firms, where the employees are passionate about the company\nand work in long-lasting, family-like structures, have a greater likelihood of\nsurviving and going public.\n\nWhen Ward and his co-founder Scott Uknes founded their company in 2012, they\nbuilt on the paper\u2019s insights, creating the non-hierarchical structure and\nconsidering internal processes with the commitment blueprint in mind. For\nexample, new employees go through a months-long hiring process, including\nhourlong reference calls and interviews with numerous employees, to make sure\nthey have both the needed technical proficiency and a willingness to\nparticipate in the company culture.\n\nWard and Uknes eventually contacted one of the authors of the research paper,\nJames Baron, now the William S. Beinecke Professor of Management at Yale SOM,\nthinking he might be interested in visiting. Baron upped the ante and\nsuggested the company could be a subject for a Yale case study. A firm that\neschews hierarchy and other assumptions inherent in most company structures\nmight be a paradoxically effective example to teach MBA students about\nleadership, HR, and organizational models.\n\n_Yale Insights_ talked with Baron about organizational blueprints, AgBiome\u2019s\napplication and modification of the commitment model, and what students and\nother organizations can learn from its example.\n\n  \n**Q: Tell us about the paper that you wrote that influenced AgBiome\u2019s\nstructure.**\n\nWhile I was at Stanford, I worked with a number of colleagues to trace several\nhundred emerging companies in Silicon Valley over more than a decade. We\nlooked at the way in which the founders built the companies and how the\ncompanies evolved over time. We were able to look at the effect of culture on\nhow firms grew, whether or not they survived, whether or not they went public,\nif they went public how well they did, how bureaucratic they became, and so\nforth.\n\nOur paper in the _California Management Review_ intrigued the founders of\nAgBiome. They built their company around a commitment model and last year\ninvited me to visit. We turned the visit into a Yale raw case.\n\n**Q: What is the commitment model?**\n\nWe found five broad blueprints for organizing companies. The commitment\nblueprint was one where people were recruited to the firm based on their\ndesire to be part of an enduring, family-like entity. They were controlled by\na strong peer culture, and their affection was really to the organization more\nthan to the specific project that they happened to be working on.\n\nHewlett-Packard in its glory days would be the quintessential commitment\norganization. The top-tier Japanese companies of the 1980s were commitment\ncompanies. People came in at  \nthe entry level and stayed over the course of their career. They were deeply\nloyal to the organization, not to whatever particular role they were assigned\nto.\n\nIt\u2019s an organizational form that\u2019s been around for a long time and certainly\nnot limited to Silicon Valley.\n\n**Q: Why has it worked for tech firms?**\n\nWe spoke with venture capitalists who follow Silicon Valley companies. None of\nthem forecast that we were going find the commitment model to do so well, but\nonce we achieved the results that we did, they had an interesting explanation.\nThey said startups confront two key issues: success and failure.\n\nIn firms that are successful more rapidly than people anticipate, there\u2019s this\nperennial problem of how you keep people engaged. How do you motivate them to\nmove on to version 2.0? With the commitment model, since people\u2019s affection is\nreally to an abiding organizational entity, they\u2019re much less likely to cash\nout their stock options and buy an island in the Caribbean or whatever they\u2019re\ndreaming of doing.\n\nConversely, when you confront initial failure, since people are attached not\nto that specific project, but to the premise of the organization itself,\nthey\u2019re more inclined to stay on in the face of a setback, whereas if you\u2019ve\nrecruited star talent to a particular project and that project doesn\u2019t pan\nout, that talent will leave immediately.\n\nThe fact that commitment can help firms cope with either unanticipated success\nor unanticipated failure may be its biggest strength.\n\n**Q: Your study looked at companies in their first decade. Does the commitment\nmodel continue to be an advantage as firms mature?**\n\nWe didn\u2019t find any strong evidence to suggest that it didn\u2019t, and in fact, we\nfound that firms that started with a commitment model but abandoned it paid a\npretty steep price because workers who are there because of an abiding love\nfor the organization see the culture change.\n\nClearly, as organizations get bigger, as they get more diverse, holding a\ncommitment blueprint together becomes more challenging because you can\u2019t rely\nas extensively on informal interaction and everybody knowing one another in\norder to propagate the culture.\n\n**Q: Is AgBiome typical of organizations using the commitment model?**\n\nAgBiome uses committees to make every decision in the firm, including broad\nstrategy decisions, including decisions about the CEO\u2019s compensation. Not all\ncommitment firms have such radical decentralization.\n\nThey felt very strongly that being nonhierarchical and participative was going\nto be critical to their business. I think they have a pretty compelling case\nthat given their strategy and the kind of business that they\u2019re in, a\nnonhierarchical structure not only enables them to attract and retain better\nscientific talent, which is critical to their mission, but also allows them to\nmake decisions faster and better, which they argue differentiates them from\nlarger, more bureaucratic competitors.\n\nCertainly, it\u2019s not a model that would fit every industry or every sector. I\nthink knowledge-intensive industries where you require a lot of collaboration\nand intellectual coordination are the settings where this model is most\ncompelling.\n\n**Q: How does the company approach recruitment?**\n\nBecause it\u2019s so important that commitment firms recruit people who share their\nvalues and can function as part of a team, by definition, they are much more\nselective. Anybody who recruits with AgBiome discovers very quickly that it\u2019s\na different kind of organization. They need scientific specialists, but much\nmore emphasis is put on, \u201cIs this person going to fit our culture and be\nsomebody that will flourish with the rest of the team?\u201d and less on concrete\ntechnical skills.\n\nThey handle recruitment in a very different and extended way. They interview\nyour references extensively before they even talk to you. Recruits meet many,\nmany people throughout the organization. Because the best way of guaranteeing\nthat someone\u2019s going to be a full-fledged member of the team is to involve the\nteam very actively in the recruitment process, it tends to go much more\nslowly. They\u2019re very careful to make sure that people aren\u2019t surprised when\nthey show up on day one about what they\u2019re getting themselves into.\n\nOne of the concomitants of the commitment model is that growth has to be more\nmeasured and more focused than it might otherwise be.\n\n**Q: How successful are they in finding good fits?**\n\nThere are some cases where people make it through who are not a match, and\nthere\u2019s some selection out of those misfits. A few more have left voluntarily\nto go back to school, but when we asked them about turnover, they kind of\nlaughed and said, \u201cThat\u2019s just not a problem that we have.\u201d\n\nThey say AgBiome is not for everybody. But they believe that the kinds of\nscientific and technical talent that they\u2019re trying to recruit, A, those\npeople want to work on really cool stuff in an unencumbered way, and B, many\nof them find it really interesting to have the opportunity to play a role in\nthe broader governance of the organization, which workers do in this\norganization.\n\n\u201cAgBiome raises questions for students about our assumptions about what an\norganization needs to look like.\u201d\n\nThey sit on committees, that, as I said, determine compensation or business\ndevelopment priorities. Employees get a much broader exposure to the\norganization and interesting variety added to their work by virtue of being a\npart of its governance.\n\n**Q: How does an organization with no titles and no hierarchy handle\nadvancement?**\n\nAdvancement means growing deeper and deeper in your area of professional\nexpertise and growing deeper and deeper in assuming responsibility for the\ngovernance of the organization. As people do that, they are recognized for it,\nbut not by moving up a well-defined bureaucratic hierarchy.\n\nThey have a recognition committee that works with the compensation committee.\nWhen people have, in the view of the committee, passed a professional\nmilestone, achieved greater depth of responsibility and greater professional\nexpertise, they will celebrate that with a recognition. That usually would\ninclude an increase in compensation and some kind of honorific recognition.\n\n**Q: As the company itself grows, how does it keep this family-like structure\nwithout becoming unwieldy?**\n\nThe idea the company uses to describe growth is cellular division. That\u2019s the\nmindset that their scientists come to naturally, so they have adopted a model\nof spinning off cells that are to be no larger than 50 to 70 people\u2014a size at\nwhich people can manage relationships with one another in a trusting way.\nThere\u2019s neuroscience that supports that view.\n\nThese folks make all of their organizing decisions based, not on intuition or\nsome diffuse set of value commitments, but on careful review of scholarly\nresearch. When they decided that they were going to move to this model of\ncells, they went to the anthropological literature to find the optimal sizes\nof tribes, which is where the 50 to 70 size comes from.\n\nThey\u2019ve now created four of these cells and something called a cell senate,\nwhich is intended to coordinate between and among the cells. There\u2019s a lot of\nstructure that\u2019s required to hold this thing together. As they get bigger and\nmore diverse, the question will be whether the effort that is required to\neschew hierarchy ends up becoming an encumbrance itself, whether people are\nspending so much time on committees that they\u2019re not able to actually focus on\ntheir regular nine-to-five job.\n\n**Q: What can other companies learn from this?**\n\nThe founders of AgBiome buy into a core set of assumptions, which if you don\u2019t\nbuy into them, would make it hard to move in the direction that they\u2019ve moved.\nThe way that they put it is, if you look at the people that you\u2019re hiring,\nthey\u2019re carrying on complicated lives in which they\u2019re exercising a lot of\nresponsibility in their finances, in the rearing of their children, in caring\nfor their parents, in serving as members of their community. They argue many\norganizations seem to presume employees are not trustworthy and their job\nshould be specialized as narrowly as possible in order to minimize the scope\nof damage that they can do to the organization.\n\nThey believe that the same degree of efficacy and trustworthiness that you see\npeople displaying in the other arenas of their lives should be the starting\npoint in thinking about how you build an organization. They also believe that\nmanagement is best done by people themselves.\n\nNow, that\u2019s a bit controversial to a school of management, where many of our\nstudents fancy themselves as being specialized overseers of employees, but the\nfolks at AgBiome would say, to the extent that you can minimize the reliance\non specialized managers, it\u2019s not only less expensive, it\u2019s much faster in\nterms of decision-making, because it removes these intermediate layers that\nhave to be gone through whenever decisions need to be made.\n\n**Q: Is there a C-suite team or other version of upper management?**\n\nScott Uknes and Eric Ward are the co-founders and co-CEOs. They really do work\njointly. Eric and Scott are talked about as if that\u2019s almost one word. They do\nhave a few people in C-suite roles, a CFO and the head of HR. But, even there,\nthey exercise their roles differently. They act more as a resource to the\nemployee committees than the sole decision maker within the domain of their\njob title. Clearly, as the firm gets bigger it would not be a surprise to see\nmore specialized senior roles. They now have somebody in charge of sales, so\nthey are starting to develop a leadership team.\n\nOf course, over time they\u2019re going to get more formal. There will be more\nspecialization, but I don\u2019t see that as an indictment of the model. The goal\nfor them is to try to minimize, but not eliminate entirely, hierarchy and\nspecialization. I don\u2019t think the question is, do they still look like they\nlooked when they were first founded? The question to ask is, do they still\nlook less bureaucratic and nonhierarchical than an otherwise comparable firm\nin their industry?\n\n**Q: How does this raw case fit into the Employee course that you teach to\nfirst-year MBA students?**\n\nMany of the cases that we studied are large, long-lived organizations. I\nwanted one that was at the other end of the evolutionary spectrum. A young\ntech-oriented start up in the Research Triangle in the process of developing\nits HR architecture is compelling.\n\nAgBiome raises questions for the students about our assumptions about what an\norganization needs to look like, some of these assumptions that we talked\nabout before: the role of management, whether workers can and should be\ntrusted to make critical decisions or whether those decisions really ought to\nbe vested in the senior ranks of the organization. When the folks from AgBiome\ngot in touch, it seemed like a really propitious opportunity.\n\nAgBiome is a very strongly mission-driven organization that believes that it\nis harnessing science for the purpose of helping feed the world and promote\nagricultural development. The virtue of a compelling mission that drives the\nleadership that you are engaged in is a really important takeaway from the\ncase.\n\n![](https://insights.som.yale.edu/sites/default/files/styles/yale_insights_thumb/public/profile_pictures/baron_2.jpg?itok=xebEl8f4)\n\n[James N.

They are an admission that the\nbusiness has got out of control. But many of us have had to do it at some time\nor another, writes Malcolm Newbery, who explains  some of the methods and\ntools used to decide - and then take - unpleasant actions.**\n\n_This article continues the discussion started in '[Profitability benchmarking\nfor fashion management](/comment/profitability-benchmarking-for-fashion-\nmanagement_id136867.aspx)' published on just-style last month._\n\nIn order to explain the various cost cutting options, I have created an\nimaginary, but realistic business. It is a fashion brand that sells:\n\n  * Wholesale to 400 stockist accounts across the world;\n  * Retail in the UK, Asia and US from 100 physical stores;\n  * On its own e-commerce website to around 100,000 customers generating 10% (and a growing %) of physical retail sales.\n\nThe total value of the company's turnover is a little over GBP100m. It has\nbeen analysed in more detail in the first article on Profitability\nBenchmarking. To service this level of business it employs almost exactly\n1,000 staff, some salaried, some paid weekly for clerical work, and some paid\nhourly (the warehouse). There are also commission-based wholesale agents\naround the world. The business designs, develops, buys, sells and delivers its\nfashion merchandise:\n\n  * To wholesale customers around the world;\n  * To its retail stores in UK, Asia and US;\n  * Direct to its individual e-commerce (D2C) customers.\n\n![](https://i4.aroq.com/articles/2019-10-07-17-13-styleorganisationchart.jpg)\n\nThe organisation chart above in Figure 1 shows how the company is structured.\nFive functions report to a chief executive, with some of these having more\nthan one responsibility:\n\n  * The retail director has responsibility for HR, as its work is heavily skewed towards the shops;\n  * The head of wholesale also oversees e-commerce;\n  * The buying and merchandising director runs the warehouse because he is responsible for stock;\n  * The finance director manages IT support for everyone;\n  * Brand includes marketing and design.\n\nThe chart also shows that there are six levels of seniority: directors (there\nare 4); heads of (2); senior management (31); junior management (129, of which\n95 are shop managers); clerical workers (782 of which 750 are shop\nassistants); hourly paid workers (51 in the warehouse).\n\n**It's all gone wrong!**\n\nTables 1-3 set the scene for the last two seasons autumn/winter and\nspring/summer.\n\n| Autumn/winter \u2013 Budget (GBPm)| Autumn/winter \u2013 Actual (GBPm)| Autumn/winter\n\u2013 Variance (GBPm)  \n---|---|---|---  \nSales at full price, retail| 52.00| 50.90| -1.10  \nSales at wholesale prices| 3.20| 3.25| 0.05  \nSales through retail ecommerce| 5.00| 4.82| -0.18  \nTotal sales at full price| 60.20| 58.97| -1.23  \nSales excluding VAT| 50.17| 49.14| -1.03  \nMarkdown losses| 2.51| 2.60| 0.10  \nNet sales after markdowns| 47.66| 46.54| -1.12  \nCost of sales (purchases)| 18.76| 18.42| -0.34  \nAchieved gross margin| 28.90| 28.12| -0.78  \nOverhead costs| | |  \n>>Retail space cost| 8.10| 8.15| 0.05  \n>>Retail staff cost| 12.40| 12.45| 0.05  \n>>Head office staff cost| 4.85| 4.80| -0.05  \n>>Head office other costs| 2.40| 2.45| 0.05  \nTotal overhead costs| 27.75| 27.85| 0.10  \nOperating profit before interest and tax| 1.15| 0.27| -0.88  \n  \nAs can be seen from the bottom of Table 1 (above), the operating profit for\nautumn/winter failed to reach the budget by GBP0.88m (76.72% off the budget).\nThe end result was caused by a number of adverse factors, mitigated by a few\npositives. The adverse factors were:\n\n  * Physical store retail sales down;\n  * E-commerce sales down;\n  * Markdown losses slightly worse than budgeted;\n  * All overhead costs except head office staff higher than budgeted.\n\nIndividually, each variance was quite small. Together they affected operating\nprofit significantly. At the time, management took the view that all of these\nfactors were minor and that working to achieve the spring/summer budget was\nthe company priority.\n\nHowever, spring/summer got worse, not better, as Table 2 shows below.\n\n| Spring/summer \u2013 Budget (GBPm)| Spring/summer \u2013 Actual (GBPm)| Spring/summer\n\u2013 Variance (GBPm)  \n---|---|---|---  \nSales at full price, retail| 48.00| 46.45| -1.55  \nSales at wholesale prices| 2.80| 2.70| -0.10  \nSales through retail ecommerce| 5.00| 5.10| 0.10  \nTotal sales at full price| 55.80| 54.25| -1.55  \nSales excluding VAT| 46.50| 45.21| -1.29  \nMarkdown losses| 2.33| 2.40| 0.07  \nNet sales after markdowns| 44.18| 42.81| -1.36  \nCost of sales (purchases)| 17.33| 16.84| -0.49  \nAchieved gross margin| 26.85| 25.97| -0.87  \nOverhead costs| | |  \n>>Retail space cost| 8.15| 8.15| 0.00  \n>>Retail staff cost| 12.10| 12.15| 0.05  \n>>Head office staff cost| 4.85| 5.05| 0.20  \n>>Head office other costs| 2.40| 2.44| 0.04  \nTotal overhead costs| 27.50| 27.79| 0.29  \nOperating profit before interest and tax| -0.66| -1.82| -1.16  \n  \nAs the variance analysis shows\n\n  * Both retail shop sales and wholesale sales had adverse variances against budget. Only e-commerce was positive;\n  * Markdown losses again slightly exceeded budget;\n  * Achieved gross margin was down;\n  * All overheads except retail staff costs were higher than budget.\n\nThe result was an operating profit loss, worse than that budgeted. A serious\nblow for the company.\n\nOf course this caused a hue and cry about the reasons. Everything was blamed,\nfrom unseasonable weather (a great favourite of retailers), through Brexit\nuncertainty, to the entire design range being \"off trend.\" But one thing was\ncertain: No action was no longer an option.\n\nWhen the two seasons were amalgamated to produce an annual picture, as shown\nin Table 3 below:\n\n  * All sales have small negative variances;\n  * Markdown losses are worse than budgeted;\n  * Achieved gross margin is down;\n  * Overheads are higher than budget;\n  * A small operating profit has become an operating loss.\n\n| Annual Budget (GBPm)| Annual Actual (GBPm)| Annual Variance (GBPm)  \n---|---|---|---  \nSales at full price, retail| 100.00| 97.35| -2.65  \nSales at wholesale prices| 6.00| 5.95| -0.05  \nSales through retail ecommerce| 10.00| 9.92| -0.08  \nTotal sales at full price| 116.00| 113.22| -2.78  \nSales excluding VAT| 96.67| 94.35| -2.32  \nMarkdown losses| 4.83| 5.00| 0.17  \nNet sales after markdowns| 91.83| 89.35| -2.48  \nCost of sales (purchases)| 36.08| 35.25|  \nAchieved gross margin| 55.75| 54.10| -1.65  \nOverhead costs| | |  \n>>Retail space cost| 16.25| 16.30| 0.05  \n>>Retail staff cost| 24.50| 24.60| 0.10  \n>>Head office staff cost| 9.70| 9.85| 0.15  \n>>Head office other costs| 4.80| 4.89| 0.09  \nTotal overhead costs| 55.25| 55.64| 0.39  \nOperating profit before interest and tax| 0.50| -1.54| -2.04  \n  \nBut the situation in Table 3 is not the end of the world. One operating loss\nmaking year can be tolerated, as long as the business is securely funded.\nBusinesses go broke (Chapter 11 in the US and in administration in the UK)\nwhen they run out of cash and the bank will give them no more, not when they\nmake losses. What very recently pushed [Jack Wills into a distressed\nacquisition by Michael Ashley's Sports Direct](/news/sports-direct-acquires-\njack-wills-lifestyle-brand_id136774.aspx) was the scale of the losses and the\nhaemorrhaging of cash. In the year to 31 January 2018, Jack Wills lost GBP29m\non sales of GBP139m. So, its cost of purchases and overheads was GBP168m. The\nyear to 31 January 2019 was certainly worse. The current year worse again. Our\ncompany is certainly not finished yet. Time to take cost cutting action.\n\n**The cost cut options not to follow**\n\nThis brings us to the main point of this article. When you have to cut: Whose\nresponsibility is it? Who actually does it? How is it done, and by what rules\nand methods?\n\nI will argue that when so many of the benchmarks are being missed, the\nresponsibility lies with the chief executive. The scenarios in Tables 1-3\npoint the finger in so many different directions that there can be no one\nscapegoat. So we are not going to blame the design team for two poor ranges,\nand just tell them to produce a better one. Besides, in most fashion\nretailers, it is not the sole responsibility of design. Input into the ranges\nis taken from the buying and merchandising department, the retail store\nmanagement, and the wholesale agents who have to show ranges to customers. In\nthe best e-commerce businesses, the range is pre-showed to loyal customers who\nform a focus group.\n\nSome data analytics software companies argue that the answer lies in bringing\nthe worst performers in any part of the business up to the standard of at\nleast the average, or the top or second quartile. I disagree with that as\nwell. There are many reasons why a particular retail area or wholesale country\nmarket will not or cannot be made better. This approach has the same fallacy\nas the SWOT theory analysis. It tells you to \"turn your weaknesses into\nstrengths.\" If you are weak somewhere, there is probably a reason, and the\nsolution is to get out of what you are not good at (not waste time and effort\ntrying to do it better).\n\nNor should we just push up the various sales based benchmarks [outlined in the\nfirst article](/comment/profitability-benchmarking-for-fashion-\nmanagement_id136867.aspx). There is no reason to suppose that we can improve\nshop sales densities, nor expect direct e-commerce consumers to pay more, and\nequally not do the same to wholesale accounts without getting an elasticity of\ndemand backlash. I am afraid the most natural solution is to cut the things we\nare in control of: namely costs.\n\n**The cost cut routes to actively consider**\n\nThe first is the cost of sales (purchases). Actively instruct the buying and\nmerchandising team to obtain lower costs from suppliers. But these rarely come\nfrom just banging the table or threatening suppliers, although I have seen\nmany retailers try that. The answer has to be to compromise by using what the\nindustry calls garment engineering. Take out garment detail and reduce the\nsewing time. Use cheaper fabric and hope the customer will not notice or not\ncare. Simplify the entire garment construction. And, as a last resort, desert\ntrusted suppliers and move to lower cost countries.\n\nThe second is to attack retail staff costs. There are a number of ways of\ndoing this, from gentle to draconian:\n\n  * The most gentle is natural wastage. It will take time, and will not save you much.\n  * Second is a small reduction, based on last in, first out. An easy solution, but it ignores staff abilities.\n  * Third is an arbitrary % staff cull. But who chooses who will be culled?\n  * Fourth is delayering. Take out some of our six layers of job seniority. This is a common solution, but it requires systems and process change behind it.\n\nThe third area for cuts is the warehouse; change processes to cut staff costs.\nThis is emotionally easy for head office. Very few people love the warehouse:\ntheir processes are relatively simplistic; and they are usually physically far\naway from the centres of decision making. I believe this is a cop out.\n\nThe fourth - and one than many companies are terrified of contemplating - is\nto downsize head office to reduce its staff cost. They are terrified because\ncutting head office needs more than just process simplification. It requires a\npractical approach to a new buzzword: Business Transformation.\n\nHow much can we expect from this? It depends on the methods chosen. A weak\napproach might generate savings of 2% of staff costs, hardly affecting\noperating profit. A draconian approach might generate 10% of staff costs,\nenough to make a big impact on overhead costs but at an unknown danger to the\nstability of the business.\n\n**Business transformation**\n\nLet's go back to Business Transformation, a recent buzzword that in my view\nhas not been thought through by many who use the term. If this is to be more\nthan just internal cost cutting, it has to mean \"stop doing the things the\ncompany does badly and loses money on.\"\n\nIn this article, I can only hazard a guess on what the areas might be that are\nripe for Business Transformation. The [third article will develop these\nideas](/comment/business-transformation-how-to-move-beyond-the-\nbuzzword_id137392.aspx). I am suggesting that it is unlikely to include the\ne-commerce function, because it is growing. Therefore the e-commerce staff are\nsafe.\n\nBut it could include:\n\n  * Parts of wholesale, if there are geographic regions that, treated as separate business, do not cover the costs of agent's commissions, cash collection, marketing support, and warehouse processing and transport.\n  * Parts of physical retail, either regions of the UK domestic market, or overseas countries or territories.\n\nIn other words, no-one is safe. This approach changes the thrust from a\nfunctional review of cost areas, to a holistic view of the company as a series\nof discrete businesses. It can therefore only be undertaken by a taskforce led\nfrom the very top by the chief executive because it crosses all cost area\nborders and requires wide-ranging \"what if\" thinking outside the box.

Rather than the traditional\nstructure that aligns IT practitioners to specific functional areas like human\nresources or supply chain, technologists like programmers and systems\narchitects are a shared resource pool that floats between projects based on\nneed.\n\nPerhaps the biggest change is team makeup: Practicing clinicians, including\npharmacists and physicians, are embedded with programmers and infrastructure\nspecialists to serve as product owners that drive future offerings and\nservices. \u201cIt would behoove most technology leaders to start thinking about\nleading on digital products by organizing like a product team,\u201d says Angela\nYochem, executive vice president and chief digital and technology officer for\nthe healthcare provider made up of 15 hospitals and more than 600 physician\npractices.\n\n[ Learn from your peers: Check out our [State of the CIO 2019\nreport](https://www.cio.com/article/3335497/cio-role/winter-2019-state-of-the-\ncio.html) on the challenges and concerns of CIOs today. | Find out the [7\nskills of successful digital\nleaders](https://www.cio.com/article/3298596/leadership-management/7-skills-\nof-successful-digital-leaders.html) and the [secrets of highly innovative\nCIOs](https://www.cio.com/article/3245850/6-secrets-of-highly-innovative-\ncios). | Get weekly insights by [signing up for our CIO Leader\nnewsletter](http://cio.com/newsletters/signup.html). ]\n\nYochem\u2019s definition of a modern IT structure includes team members who are\nrepresentative of customers or the people engaging customers. For example, a\nconsumer banking IT team should include a teller or bank manager, she\ncontends, and a retail enterprise should enlist a store manager as part of an\nIT delivery team. \u201cBeing a business leader means understanding the customer,\nand you can\u2019t do that if all you\u2019re doing is wearing an IT hat,\u201d she explains.\n\u201cYou have to create a team that includes some unconventional players.\u201d\n\nAs CIOs take the reins on digital transformation, many, like Yochem, are\nremodeling their IT organizations to reflect a greater emphasis on customer\ncentricity and to increase an agile response to shifting business needs. The\npressure on IT leaders to evolve their organizations for the era of digital\nbusiness comes straight from the top: According to the [2019 State of the CIO\nsurvey](https://www.cio.com/article/3335497/winter-2019-state-of-the-\ncio.html), CEO\u2019s top priority for CIOs is to lead business and digital\ntransformation initiatives, cited by 38 percent of respondents. In addition,\n88 percent of respondents to the survey believe CIOs are more involved with\nleading digital transformation efforts than any of their business\ncounterparts.\n\nAs part of that dynamic, 81 percent of CIOs are embracing an expanded role,\ntaking on new responsibilities in areas such as data analytics (64%),\noperations (43%), business development (38%), and customer service (32%), the\n2019 State of the CIO research found. CIOs, 91 percent of whom see their role\nas becoming more digital and innovation focused, are also increasingly being\ntasked with creating [new revenue-generating\ninitiatives](https://www.cio.com/article/3289758/6-secrets-of-revenue-\ngenerating-cios.html) around products and services, which warrants a different\napproach to IT organizational structure and staffing.\n\n\u201cThe whole concept of traditional IT is fast expiring,\u201d says Satya Jayadev,\nvice president and CIO at Skyworks. \u201cWhen you think about traditional IT, you\nthink about operations, ERP, infrastructure management, and custom\ndevelopment. Today, there\u2019s a paradigm shift in the business\u2019 expectations of\nIT. They look at IT as more of an advisor or technology enabler of innovation.\nIt\u2019s more about how to infuse technology to solve my problem.\u201d\n\n## Business-savvy IT\n\nEight months into his tenure at Skyworks, Jayadev has taken a number of steps\nto reinvent the firm\u2019s 110-person IT organization. While the team still\nmaintains ownership of architecture strategy, most of the IT organization\u2019s\noperational responsibilities \u2014 management of firewalls, networks, and storage\n\u2014 have been subbed out to [managed service\nproviders](https://www.cio.com/article/2930498/why-businesses-are-turning-to-\nmanaged-it-services.html) and orchestrated based on [service level agreements\n(SLAs)](https://www.cio.com/article/3276284/10-dos-and-donts-for-crafting-\nmore-effective-slas.html), he says. Another big shift is the creation of high\nperformance teams that include business relationship managers, who have as\nmuch deep-rooted business knowledge as they do technical domain expertise, and\nwho currently outnumber the ranks of traditional technologists. These business\nrelationship managers are embedded in different functional areas such as\nsupply chain, finance, or operations and play a critical role in day-to-day\ncollaboration and decision making.\n\n **[[Looking to upgrade your career in tech? This comprehensive online course\nteaches you\nhow.](https://pluralsight.pxf.io/c/321564/424552/7490?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pluralsight.com%2Fpaths%2Fupgrading-\nyour-technology-career) ]**\n\n\u201cOur core IT leaders are more business savvy than tech savvy,\u201d Jayadev says.\n\u201cIf you walk into a meeting, you can\u2019t differentiate between who is business\nand who is IT because everyone is speaking the same language.\u201d\n\nAt Novant Health, IT restructuring is as much about promoting customer\ncentricity and creating greater synergy with the business functions as it is\nabout increasing the organization\u2019s agility. Traditional IT organizations are\narchitected around a solution \u2014 for example, an HR IT team or a supply chain\nIT group \u2014 and that structure hampers the ability to quickly switch gears to\npursue new markets or digital business opportunities, Yochem says. \u201cThe\nproblem with old-school IT is it can\u2019t flex or pivot quickly enough \u2014 it\u2019s not\noptimized for change, but for stability,\u201d she explains.\n\nTo inject more agility into IT, Yochem has fashioned the organization in the\nstyle of a tech company product team, complete with UX specialists and\nengineers responsible for [journey\nmapping](https://www.cio.com/article/3313637/what-is-a-customer-journey-map-a-\nnew-playbook-cios-must-master.html) and third-party partnerships. Separate\nfrom the product delivery teams are competency areas in disciplines such as\nquality assurance (QA) and testing, which can be deployed and redeployed\nacross the various product delivery teams and initiatives as needed \u2014 a model\nthat aids in scalability and greatly minimizes, or eliminates, the\nquintessential IT backlog.\n\nNovant Health\u2019s IT organization has also moved away from an old-school\npipeline where technology projects are ranked against each other to an\n[investment portfolio approach](https://www.cio.com/article/3268167/your-it-\nresolution-for-2018-build-better-budget-habits.html), in which projects are\nprioritized based on potential outcomes. \u201cA product-centric approach allows us\nto manage the evolution of internal and external facing products over time\noptimally,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt lets us shift investment faster than we could\nbefore.\u201d\n\nRounding out Novant Health\u2019s new IT structure is experimentation services,\ndesigned to ensure faster adoption of new technologies while giving the\ncompany an ability to invest in emerging solutions to keep it on the fast\ntrack. The experimentation services, modeled much like a standard [\u201cas-a-\nservice\u201d model](https://www.cio.com/article/3373841/xaas-making-the-shift-to-\nservices-oriented-it.html), allows the health organization to understand where\nopportunities may exist \u2014 for example, the recent exploration of a video-on-\ndemand service for virtual care delivery \u2014 while ultimately allowing it to\nchange priorities with minimal resource and budget repercussions, Yochem says.\n\nWith the media industry facing major digital disruption, AE Networks is also\non a mission to redesign its IT organization to break down silos, increase\nagility, and enable a more customer-centric focus. Under the direction of\nChief Technology Officer Ishit Vachhrajani, the IT organization now comprises\nthree vertical business technology areas that fully own delivery of solutions\nand partnerships in sales and marketing, content and corporate systems, and\nenterprise media solutions. Those three vertical business technology groups\nare supported by a single, horizontal cloud and DevOps team that has oversight\nof the full IT stack, including cloud architecture, enterprise-facing\nproducts, and business intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe business technology partners\u2019 role is to understand the trends and build\ndeeper relationships with the business and they\u2019re supported by the horizontal\nteam which has deep expertise in technology,\u201d explains Vachhrajani, adding\nthat the shared team structure also encourages cross-training and the ability\nto redeploy assets to deliver services more quickly.\n\n## Culture and mindset shifts\n\nBeyond any new organizational structure, a mindset change and cultural shift\nare also essential for reorienting IT for the digital business era.\nTraditionally, IT has measured its success based on whether a particular\napplication went live on its target date or if it was launched within budget \u2014\ntoday, [it\u2019s about the business\noutcomes](https://www.cio.com/article/3327682/4-kpis-it-should-ditch-and-what-\nto-measure-instead.html) you are trying to achieve, Vachhrajani says. \u201cThe\nbenefit realization is not about making sure you go live with a product or\nsolution, but rather that you are achieving key business goals such as\nproductivity or cost savings,\u201d he explains.\n\nIn fact, the single most important role IT plays in an organization\u2019s digital\ntransformation is [facilitating\ninnovation](https://www.cio.com/article/3331301/how-to-create-a-culture-of-\ninnovation.html) by identifying which parts of the business could be digitally\ntransformed, according to 32 percent of respondents to the 2019 State of the\nCIO survey. Moreover, 59 percent of survey respondents [lean on IT as a\nstrategic advisor](https://www.cio.com/article/3227068/modernizing-it-how-to-\nthrive-as-a-cio-value-broker.html) to help proactively identify business\nopportunities and make technology recommendations. This is in contrast to 26\npercent of respondents who rely on IT primarily to identify emerging\ntechnologies that could accelerate digital transformation.\n\nAt AE Networks, Vachhrajani has formed a dedicated change management practice\nto underscore the new mindset and cultural shifts. The traditional user\nrequirement process has been replaced with business requirement sessions\ndesigned to engage business stakeholders in a fun environment like attending a\nmovie or ballgame so the time spent planning and strategizing doesn\u2019t feel\nboring and onerous, he says. There are also five cross-functional teams\n(culture, communications, fun, rewards and recognition, and education) staffed\nby people from every level of the IT organization to promote the changes and\nbuoy the new culture. In addition, every new project, be it a global sales\nsystem or content management initiative, is supported by its own branding\neffort, including creative content. \u201cA one-minute video about a new product\noffering is going to resonate more than a three-page user guide,\u201d Vachhrajani\nexplains.\n\nLa-Z-Boy also sees cultural change as instrumental to recalibrating IT for\ndigital transformation. For this organization, which is still steeped in\ntraditional IT organizational structure and practices, the current focus is on\nbuilding an agile mind set. \u201cWe are developing a culture that allows people to\ntake educated risks and to fail fast,\u201d says David Behen, the company\u2019s vice\npresident and CIO. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as it sounds.\u201d To do so, Behen has\ninstituted a new role of business relationship manager and is sketching out\nwhat the [IT skill set of the\nfuture](https://www.cio.com/article/3268945/future-proof-your-it-career-with-\nthese-critical-skills.html) looks like without trying to intimidate current\nstaff.\n\nAs companies move forward with IT transformation, they should know there isn\u2019t\none mold for building an organization primed for digital business. Depending\non the industry or the individual organization, there will be a need for\ndifferent structures and different skill sets, notes Rohinee Mohindroo, a\nveteran CIO and currently co-founder of dyjit.\n\nOne consistent practice, however, is the need to institute fluidity in terms\nof how the work gets done. Traditional silos and handoffs need to be replaced\nwith processes that allow for greater agility and scalability, and the lines\nbetween IT and traditional functions such as HR and legal need to blur as\nwell, Mohindroo says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just IT that needs to change \u2014 all the supporting functions around\nIT need to evolve,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t advance the IT organization in skills\nand talent management if your HR team isn\u2019t up to it, and you can\u2019t do things\nfrom a data and artificial intelligence (AI) perspective if the legal team\nisn\u2019t up to par. The lines between IT and traditional functions within an\norganization need to get a lot more fluid as well.\u201d\n\n**More on IT leadership**\n\n  * [ 7 skills of successful digital leaders

ZDNet spoke to Jochen Linkohr, the manager of HR IT at Daimler, to\nfind out more.\n\n**ZDNet: When did you start looking at using the graph data model in HR and\nwhat attracted you to it?**\n\nLinkohr: For us, we could see advantages to using graph technology in HR\nprojects because HR data is not isolated, so you don't normally have one\nperson working without a connection to another person. If you look at a\ncompany, every time you look at the people working in the company you will see\nthat they all have a connection to other people working in the company, you\nwon't see anybody who is completely isolated.\n\nThat is one of the reasons why we thought that HR data might be a very good\nfit with a graph data model. We have started with trying to understand what\ngraph and HR data have in common.\n\n![jochen-\nlinkohr2018.png](https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/02/27/10fbf429-60df-47d5-80fa-b6de64724e73/resize/270xauto/9d881457924bdee8e4ab62de6488f1bc/jochen-\nlinkohr2018.png)\n\nLinkohr: \"We have started with trying to understand what graph and HR data\nhave in common.\"\n\nPhoto: Daimler\n\nLet us says that John is working on an analytics project and you have another\nperson, Amy, who is also working in HR. Then if you have another dataset which\nis an analytics project for HR, then you have a connection between John and\nAmy because they are working on an analytics project for HR.\n\nSo data and the information on this data is not in the data itself \u2014 there is\nJohn, there is Amy and there is the analytics nature of the project. And that\nis the basis of a graph and that fits very well with the real world.\n\nThat is the first reason. The second reason, and it's a concrete reason why we\ncreated this structured application, is that we created our [Leadership\n2020](https://annualreport.daimler.com/gb2016/to-our-\nshareholders/leadership-2020-together-into-the-future) programme at Daimler.\nWe are [transforming as a company](https://daimler-\ntrucksnorthamerica.com/innovate/corporate-headquarters/) from the classical,\nhierarchical structure to a mixture of classic hierarchies and what is [called\na 'swarm'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence) which is a\nmixture of the same people working on the same project but coming from\ndifferent departments and different hierarchies.\n\nAnd we thought that when dealing with this multi-structured data, it might be\na good starting point for using graphs because we have a lot of structures\nbeing transformed to other structures because somebody wants to know who is\nworking in a swarm.\n\nSo, if somebody wants to know who is working on a swarm and in which\nstructure, in which factory and things like that, then at some point you have\nto manage this data. We thought that this would be a good starting point to\ncreate a system that would be doing this.\n\nThis was the starting point for the first project which is called Structure\nCube.\n\n**Can you explain what the aim was?**\n\nCompanies normally have a hierarchy where somebody has a boss; the boss has a\nboss and so on. But if you don't have that clear hierarchy and the company is\norganised using swarm then they might refer to a location where you manage\ndifferent structures, So, I am working here within, let's say, five different\nstructures. You can look at my data on a hierarchy level but you can also look\nat different structures on where I am working, on what I am working and which\nswarms I am working in order to get a result.\n\nSo, if you want to match all these structures on top of another structure, you\nwill end up matching all the nodes which are the people who have their own\nnodes and you have to do an _n_ -dimensional matching of all these structures\nand other structures.\n\n **SEE:[IT pro's guide to GDPR\ncompliance](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/it-pro-\ns-guide-to-gdpr-\nreadiness/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b#link=%7B%22linkText%22:%22IT%20pro's%20guide%20to%20GDPR%20compliance%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-\nlibrary/whitepapers/it-pro-s-guide-to-gdpr-\nreadiness/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b%22,%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22absolu) (free\nPDF)**\n\nYou have to build all these structures using the same data but structured in a\ndifferent way. That is the starting point and we end up with a Structure Cube.\n\n **Did you start with one plan for a particular part of the company or did you\naim to do it for all the company?**\n\nWe started with the whole company, Daimler AG [a company with 250,000\nemployees]. We started to integrate all of the structure within it. Not on all\nof the structures but on the structures that are common to the whole company.\n\n**Could you give me an example of a structure?**\n\nA structure may be a classic hierarchy \u2014 who is the boss of who? Another\nstructure may be where are you working or in which swarm? You can have a row-\nbased organisational chart or a hierarchy-based chart. You can also have a\nlocation-based organisational chart dependent on which location you are\nworking in because one company or one division of our company may not be at\nthe same location. So, there are different ways to construct charts depending\non the data.\n\n **How did you collect the data \u2014 I'm assuming that you had some sort of\nautomated process to do that?**\n\nWell the data was already there but on different systems, so we just extracted\nit from the different systems or just interconnected it. So, it was there and\nthe swarm organisation had started some years ago, so we just had them\ninterface to enter the new data.\n\nThe existing data \u2014 like the classical hierarchy \u2014 is there and so we just\ninterfaced to that.\n\n **Can you give me an idea of the files as you were building them? Presumably\nyou had a pretty massive file of the employees?**\n\nWe had some thousands of nodes but it was not really that much. For a graph\ndatabase like Neo4,j that is nothing. We have the links with the nodes in\ndifferent versions of hierarchies. I think that we have in the dimension of\ntens of thousands of nodes.\n\n###  Enterprise Software\n\n  * [As support ends, Windows 7 users head for the exits](https://www.zdnet.com/article/as-support-ends-windows-7-users-head-for-the-exits/)\n  * [Must-have macOS security, productivity, and performance utilities](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-mac-apps-for-security-productivity-and-performance/)\n  * [Best video conferencing services for business: Zoom, WebEx, AnyMeeting, Slack, and more](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-video-conferencing-software-and-services-for-business/)\n  * [How many computers do you regularly use?

What was the main aim? Was\nit to increase efficiency or reduce the cost of processing the data?**\n\nUsing a graph database as we analysed the problem was logical because it was a\ngraph problem which can be easily handled with a graph-based approach. But to\nbuild a graph problem on a relational database would be more complicated than\njust using a graph database. You use the right tool to do the right things \u2014\nyou shouldn't use a hammer to put a screw in a hole. It works but is not as\ngood as it should be.\n\n**Did this process turn up any surprises such as advantages/advances that you\nhadn't anticipated?**\n\nNeo4j didn't turn up any surprises except for the surprise that it was so\neasy. I played around with Neo4j a lot beforehand and did find things that\nturned up and I thought might fit well but mainly the surprise was that it was\neasier to set up and install than we had anticipated.\n\n **Using a graph database is significantly different from using a traditional\ndatabase, were your employees able to cope with that?**\n\nIt's just a new technology and in the IT sector in general you have to be able\nto learn faster and our employees are used to that. Graph data is hundreds of\nyears old while graph data technology is new. Ten years ago, nobody talked\nabout graph databases. The IT team had no problem in learning how to use it.\n\nThere were some voices who queried why we were using new technology when they\nwere used to classical databases, but it was the case that on the one hand\nsome people wondered why, but in the main they understood very quickly.\n\n**What are the next steps? Do you see other areas of the business, outside of\nHR, that could benefit from using the technology?**\n\nInside HR using Neo4j we have already developed the Common Key Tool.\nDeveloping tools is very easy using a graph database and that is one of the\nkey advantages of Neo4j as a product. But you have to think about whether the\nproblem fits the solution and not everybody will be able to do that.\n\nBut if the problem is a graph-based problem \u2014 let's say you detect that more\nentities have huge amount of dependencies or it might be the multiple\nconnections between modes. You might have to manage and explore these\ndependencies, and, in those situations, you should think about using graph\neverywhere in the company and outside as well.\n\n### PREVIOUS AND RELATED COVERAGE\n\n>  **[Neo4j CEO: Why graph databases and AI belong\n> together](https://www.zdnet.com/article/neo4j-ceo-why-graph-databases-and-\n> ai-belong-\n> together/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.zdnet.com/article/neo4j-ceo-\n> why-graph-databases-and-ai-belong-\n> together/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22%3Cstrong%3ENeo4j%20CEO:%20Why%20graph%20databases%20and%20AI%20belong%20together%3C/strong%3E%22%7D)  \n> ** \"My favourite thing to talk about is how the human brain is a graph\".\n>\n>  **[Neo4j looks beyond the graph\n> database](https://www.zdnet.com/article/from-a-quarter-of-the-database-\n> market-in-three-years-graph-is-taking-\n> off/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.zdnet.com/article/from-\n> a-quarter-of-the-database-market-in-three-years-graph-is-taking-\n> off/%22,%22target%22:%22%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22%3Cstrong%3ENeo4j%20looks%20beyond%20the%20graph%20database%3C/strong%3E%22%7D)  \n> ** Neo4j is building a 'graph platform' based on its database.

Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\n### _A new project presented opportunities for the HR team to work on a cross-\nfunctional project, in the form of a consulting project for a non-profit\norganisation, bringing a number of successes to the table,_ _affirms_ Amrita\nRajumoothy, global talent acquisition specialist, Essilor International _._\n\nAn opportunity was presented for Essilor's global talent and global learning &\ndevelopment teams to work on a cross-functional project and to experience new\nways of working together, in the form of a consulting project for a non-profit\norganisation in the area of HR capability.\n\nThrough this project, we hoped to increase our capability as internal\n'consultants' and for us to apply a new skill and experience gained with our\ndaily job, that is, to understand, listen, comprehend, and ask questions\nbefore coming up with a solution.\n\nIn addition, we have always wanted to create a design thinking programme\ninternally and we were very thrilled that we had the opportunity to do so -\nespecially in a HR context.\n\n### Bird's eye view of the strategy\n\nBefore starting on this consulting project for the non-profit organisation,\nthe project team was cautious in considering many factors before coming up\nwith a concrete strategy for execution, especially keeping in mind the time\nframe that was set aside for the project.\n\nOur objective was to manage and execute the project within a realistic period\nwithout compromising the quality of the output. We had to ensure that the\ninformation, tools, framework, advice and our recommendations would be\nmeaningful and impactful to our clients.\n\nSince working with an NGO was new to the team, the entire process was\ninitially difficult. However, having worked in a NGO previously, our team\nmember Darlene shared valuable advise and her experience greatly helped\nSherrie and I to understand the nuances of working in an NGO vis-a-vis a\ncorporate environment.\n\nWhat also helped was for us to understand the context of the project, we spent\nsubstantial time in the beginning meeting various stakeholders in the\norganisation so that we can get a better picture of their needs, aspirations,\nand current situation.\n\n> ##### As with any project, we had to adapt to the situation along the way\n> and we must say, there were many changes to the initial plan!\n\nWe first obtained a organisational chart from our client to identify employees\nwith varying profiles, backgrounds and experience in their organisation.\nSubsequently, we arranged to have casual interviews with these employees.\n\nThe objective, essentially, was to understand viewpoints from the various\nstakeholders, i.e. board members, managers, HR, and of course the employees.\nBased on the statistics, feedback and comments, we were able to identify\ncommon themes and areas they were doing well in, and processes that could\npotentially be improved or implemented.\n\n### Eagle-eyed execution\n\nAs with any project, we had to adapt to the situation along the way and we\nmust say, there were many changes to the initial plan! Given the tight\ndeadline, our team was very transparent in what we were able to deliver,\nhowever, we were not comfortable with just providing feedback, documents and\nrecommendations - we wanted to go above and beyond.\n\nThe initial idea was to work on a 'HR scoping' project for the client, i.e. to\ncome up with HR processes and guidelines for them to implement.\n\nHowever, as we progressed with the project, we realised that mere HR process\nimplementation was not going to solve core issues such as improving the\nemployee engagement, retention and overall communication. To ensure that our\nclient is able to apply our feedback easily, we had to adapt and change our\nplans.\n\nAs such, we brainstormed and decided to facilitate a design thinking workshop\nfor the managers to understand the findings, experience the employee\nlifecycle, and think of ways to improve the current process.\n\nAmong the managers, they also prioritised their key challenges, listed a few\nactionable items and made a commitment to stick to the stated deadlines that\nthey had set.\n\n> ##### The success of this project clearly demonstrates the saying, \"if you\n> want to go quickly, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together\".\n\n### Results and key takeaways\n\nWith an objective for the L&D team to be a 'consulting' arm of the HR\ndepartment, this project provided us with a great opportunity and a sense of\nhow we can work closely for our internal 'customers'.\n\nIn fact, it also brought the global HR team closer as we collaborated and had\na better understanding of our different working styles and how we can better\nleverage on each other\u2019s strength and experience.\n\nWith the varying expertise in our respective fields, i.e. communication,\ntalent acquisition, facilitation and coaching skills, it showed us how diverse\nthe HR function is and that the different branches of HR make it a truly\nunique department.\n\nThe success of this project clearly demonstrates the saying, \"if you want to\ngo quickly, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together\".\n\n_Photo / Provided_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

These concepts and ideas are taken from my book,\n_[The Future of Work: Attract New Talent, Build Better Leaders, and Create a\nCompetitive\nOrganization](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118877241/?tag=wwwwileycom-20)_.\nThe five types of organizational structures that I will explore are:\n\n  1. [The traditional hierarchy](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/07/06/the-5-types-of-organizational-structures-part-1-the-hierarchy/) (part 1 is already available)\n  2. [Flatter organizations](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/07/08/the-5-types-of-organizational-structures-part-2-flatter-organizations/) (part 2 is already available)\n  3. [Flat organizations](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/07/13/the-5-types-of-organizational-structures-part-3-flat-organizations/ \"flat organizations\") (part 3 is already available)\n\n  4. [Flatarchies](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/07/15/the-5-types-of-organizational-structures-part-4-flatarchies/ \"flatarchies\") (part 4 is already available)\n  5. [Holacratic organizations](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/07/20/the-5-types-of-organizational-structures-part-5-holacratic-organizations/ \"holacratic organizations\") (part 5 is already available)\n\nUnlike any other corporate structure that exists, flat companies are exactly\nthat...flat. Meaning there are usually no job titles, seniority, managers, or\nexecutives. Everyone is seen as equal. Flat organizations are also oftentimes\ncalled or referred to as self-managed organizations (there can be some\ndifferences but for our case we will put them together). The most famous\nexample of this comes from Valve, the gaming company responsible for classics\nsuch as Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Portal, and many others. At Valve there are\nno job titles and nobody tells you what to work on. Instead all the employees\nat Valve can see what projects are being worked on and can join whichever\nproject they want. If an employee wants to start their own project then they\nare responsible for securing funding and building their team. For some this\nsounds like a dream for others, their worst nightmare.\n\nThere's quite a lot that can be said about this type of structure. While it\ndoes have benefits and is interesting to consider I don't see this as\nsomething that is practical or scalable for larger organizations when we think\nabout the future of work. Smaller and some medium size companies might be able\nto operate in this type of an environment but when you get to organizations\nwith thousands of employees then it becomes challenging. Most of the companies\nthat are known as being \"flat\" started that way and then grew. For example\nW.L. Gore & Associates which now has over 9,000 employees scaled their flat\nstructure over many years since the company started. This wasn't a sudden\ndecision they made after they grew to 9,000 people. Even at Gore, as the\ncompany began to grew, some structure had to be put in place.\n\nFlat organizations like every other type of structure, also have their own\nchallenges. For starters, informal hierarchies automatically get created based\non seniority, people who are at the company longer just tend to be viewed as\nbeing more senior. The lack of structure can also make accountability and\nreliability a bit of an issue as well. Finally, the company tends to develop\ncliques (think high school) where groups of people tend to support and work\nwith each other but oftentimes prefer to stay to themselves, this of course\ncan cause challenges for communication and collaboration. In fact, [I did a\npodcast interview with one of the pioneers of self-\nmanagement](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/06/04/how-\nmorningstar-farms-operates-without-any-managers/) at The Morning Star Company,\nPaul Green. In it we talked about some of these, and many other issues. If\nyou're interested in learning more about this type of a structure then I\nhighly recommend you give it a listen.\n\nThe big challenge with this type of an approach is that if a larger\norganization decided to implement it, the process would take many years and\nwould require enormous amounts of capital and resources to execute. Imagine\ngoing into an organization with 60,000 employees around the world that is\nhierarchical in nature and quite literally doing everything in the exact\nopposite way. It brings new meaning to \"don't throw the baby out with the\nbathwater.\" This doesn't mean I don't believe in self-management or don't see\nits merits, I absolutely do and the companies that have implemented it have\ndone well. However, it's simply not realistic for 96+% of companies in the\nworld. This is why I think the [\"flatter\" structure is the most scalable and\npractical](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/07/08/the-5-types-of-\norganizational-structures-part-2-flatter-organizations/) for most\norganizations. So what type of a company can a flat structure be suitable for?\nSmall organizations, some medium size companies, or companies that are created\non the idea of being flat and then scale this approach as the company grows. I\ndo want to emphasize that this series of posts isn't designed to say which\nstructure is the most superior, instead it's meant to give you perspective\naround what is available and what other organizations are implementing. Your\ncompany may decide to take bits and pieces of all the different types of\nstructures and create something that is unique to just them.Perhaps in the\nnext few decades the idea of having a flat company might catch on and become\nmore mainstream, especially as we see the freelancers economy start to grow,\nbut at least for the foreseeable future the idea of having a completely flat\ncompany...falls flat (see what I did there?)\n\n_Jacob Morgan is a keynote speaker, author (most recently of The Future of\nWork), and futurist.

However, in the era where both employee and customer are\nking/queen, organizations are looking to redesign their structures.\n\n![WhatsApp killed the organizational chart](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1536305471/1536305325.jpg)\n\nThere is a new addition to the CEO's goal sheet - figuring in the \"Best\nEmployers\" listing. The methodology could vary from sourcing 'likes' or votes\non a social media platform to the more traditional surveys across\norganizations. But the verdict is loud and clear -- being an engaged employer\nand appearing to be so is crucial for hiring talent and retaining them.\n\n These rankings have existed for a decade or so, and it is a sign of changing\ntimes that employee experience is being discussed and deliberated as much as\ncustomer experience. With technologies such as cloud, 3-D printing, blockchain\nand big data leveling the playing field across sectors, talent has been\nidentified as one of the key strategic differentiators.\n\n###  The criteria for evaluating these employers include -\n\n  1. Would you recommend your organization to a friend?  \n  \n\n  2. Likes and views by employees and non-employees etc. This clearly signifies that the next generation of employees are looking for a specific personal experience and not collective platitudes. The Organization Development expert's problem is further complicated by the fact that the pre-millennial workforce needs to quickly adapt to a man-machine work environment where your colleague may soon be a robot.\n\nOrganizational hierarchy, according to the classical model of management,\ndefines the hierarchy of managerial control. Over the last century or so, many\norganizations have challenged the traditional organizational structures, put\ntheir own spin on it or added many geometrical dimensions (flat, horizontal,\nmatrix, divisional etc). The traditional organizational hierarchy and its many\nvariants have helped identify clear roles, allocate accountability, implement\nstreamlined processes and manage growth. However, in the era where both\nemployee and customer are 'king/queen', organizations are looking to redesign\ntheir structures.\n\n### Innovations in organization structure\n\nOrganizational structure is not just about who reports to whom but a powerful\ntool to:\n\n  * Determine who gets what and how much   \n  \n\n  * Recognize and appreciate good work   \n  \n\n  * Communicate the common purpose and mission   \n  \n\n  * Knowing the pulse of the workforce   \n  \n\nIn the digital era, organizations are now reimagining their structures to meet\nthe changing demands of business and talent. Some examples include:\n\n**Zappos:** Has implemented Holocracy, a comprehensive practice for\nstructuring, governing, and running an organization. Instead of the\ntraditional organizational chart, the team at Zappos defines what work needs\nto be done and allows the employees to figure out what work they are most\nconnected to. An employee may hence be doing different roles at one point in\ntime.*\n\n**Buffer:** Moved away from having long-term, static teams, and  have shorter-\nterm, more fluid task forces which are formed for a specific purpose and then\ndisbanded once that task is completed.**\n\n**Uber:** In the wave of the leadership upheaval at Uber, the current\nleadership is working on a structure where the control is decentralized and\nnot vested in the hands of a few.\n\n### Network of Culture Keepers\n\nWhile an organization chart does well in defining where the control lies, in\nall likelihood, it may not depict the network of culture keepers in an\norganization. We define culture keepers as those who help deliver the common\ngoal and purpose of the organization, not always in line with their role or\ndesignation.\n\n> As a microcosmic reflection of society, every organization has some\n> individuals who knowingly/unknowingly imbibe the message and help foster a\n> sense of solving a common problem.\n\nThe culture keepers also have the trust of the leaders and help communicate\nsome on-ground realities that may not travel upwards. Some may argue that this\nrole may also create discord, for there is no real responsibility unless the\njob description says so, but one cannot deny their existence. One only needs\nto check his/her mobile phone to check the number of WhatsApp groups with\noffice colleagues. These do not follow the norms of traditional corporate\netiquette, ideas are welcome anywhere and the gratification is as instant as\nit gets.\n\n> The new generation organizations should consider empowering culture keepers\n> as their influence grows wider and stronger with these new forms of informal\n> communication.\n\nIt may be unproductive for HR or business leaders to engage with each and\nevery individual but in the absence of such engagement, many may feel left out\nor that their contribution went unnoticed as not every action or idea can be\nmeasured. Culture keepers can help propagate a culture of creativity and\nagility with a sense of safety and security.\n\n\n\n*

A\nstrategic reorganisation will be implemented to further strengthen the\norganisation, move Pandora closer to consumers and ensure faster and\nconsistent execution with more impactful products and marketing concepts **.**\n\n**Flat operating model to drive world class retail execution**  \nPandora will close its three regional organisations thereby eliminating an\norganisational layer between global headquarters and the local markets. The\nmore than 100 markets where Pandora operates will be grouped into 10 clusters,\neach headed by a General Manager based in the largest market in the cluster.\nThe General Managers will report to a newly established Chief Commercial\nOfficer (CCO) position.\n\nThe CCO will report to President & CEO Alexander Lacik and be part of\nPandora\u2019s Executive Leadership Team. The CCO will also be responsible for a\nretail centre of excellence to improve Pandora\u2019s global retail skills\nincluding global merchandising, store development, planning and execution. A\nnew function called Network & Franchise Management will be established to\noversee the retail estate and support franchise partners globally. The CCO\nposition will be taken up by a newly appointed external candidate who will be\nannounced shortly and is due to join Pandora early in Q2 2020.\n\n**Global organisation designed to deliver a brand experience based on deep\nconsumer insights**  \nTo offer more impactful products and marketing concepts and a more consistent\nconsumer experience across markets, Pandora will establish two Global Business\nUnits with end-to-end responsibility for product performance. One Global\nBusiness Unit will have the responsibility mainly for the core products\nincluding Moments, Charms and collaborations whereas the other Global Business\nUnit will drive the newer product categories and innovations. The new units\nwill be accountable for concept development, design, execution and marketing\nplans across the full value chain \u2013 a shift from the current set-up centred\naround product launches (\u2018drops\u2019). The Global Business Units will report to\nthe recently appointed Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), Carla Liuni, who starts\non 16 March 2020.\n\nAs part of the reorganisation, Pandora will invest in building stronger global\nfunctions including Marketing, Digital, Merchandising and Business\nIntelligence. A Global Business Services centre will be established to deliver\nefficient and scalable transactional processes and drive efficiencies through\nstandardisation and higher quality. These initiatives - to upgrade and long-\nterm future-proof Pandora - follow the already announced decision to establish\na Digital Hub in Copenhagen, the appointment of Carla Liuni as CMO, and the\nappointment of Erik Schmidt as Chief HR Officer.\n\n\u201cWith today\u2019s announcement, we bring our global headquarters closer to our\nlocal markets and consumers, and ensure that feedback from consumers can more\nquickly fuel new concept creations. The reorganisation will reduce\norganisational complexity, enable Pandora to execute with more speed and\nagility, and add critical capabilities required to support growth\u201d, says\nAlexander Lacik, President & CEO of Pandora.\n\nAs a consequence of the strategic reorganisation, 180 employees from Pandora\u2019s\nregional offices and markets will leave the company. The three current\nregional presidents will step down from the Executive Leadership Team. David\nAllen, currently President of Pandora EMEA will stay with Pandora and support\nProgramme NOW, while Sid Keswani, current President of Pandora Americas, will\nbecome President of the North America cluster. Kenneth Madsen, current\nPresident of Pandora Asia Pacific, will leave the company.\n\nThe new organisation will take effect from 2 April 2020.\n\n**EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM AFTER REORGANISATION  \n** Please find organisational chart in the enclosed document.  \n  \n **MARKET ORGANISATION  \n** Please find organisational chart in the enclosed document.\n\n**Financial implications**  \nThe reorganisation will entail additional non-recurring restructuring costs\namounting to around DKK 0.2 billion primarily related to severance payments,\nadditional consultancy support, extraordinary recruitment costs, and other\ncosts of closing down the regional offices. The total restructuring costs in\n2020 are thereby expected to amount to around DKK 1.3 billion.\n\nThe cost reductions from the redundancies of 180 employees are expected to be\nlargely offset by costs related to the further strengthening of the global\norganisation. The net cost savings are consequently expected to be limited.\n\nIn the new organisation, the management teams in the markets will focus on\nsales, marketing and retail execution. Consequently, the cost of certain\nfunctions in the markets (approximately DKK 0.3 billion annually) previously\nrecognised under Administrative expenses will be re-classified to Sales &\nDistribution expenses.\n\nOther parameters of the financial guidance for 2020 are unchanged.\n\n**ABOUT PANDORA**  \nPandora designs, manufactures and markets hand-finished jewellery made from\nhigh-quality materials at affordable prices. Pandora jewellery is sold in more\nthan 100 countries through 7,400 points of sale, including more than 2,700\nconcept stores.\n\nHeadquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark, Pandora employs 28,000 people worldwide\nand crafts its jewellery at two LEED certified facilities in Thailand using\nmainly recycled silver and gold. The company plans to be carbon neutral by\n2025 and has joined the Science Based Targets initiative to reduce emissions\nacross its full value chain. Pandora is listed on the Nasdaq Copenhagen stock\nexchange and generated sales of DKK 21.9 billion (EUR 2.9 billion) in 2019.\n\n**CONTACT**  \nFor more information, please contact:\n\n**INVESTOR RELATIONS**  \nMichael Bjergby  \nVP, Investor Relations, Tax & Treasury  \n+45 7219 5387  \nmiby@pandora.net |  **CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS**  \nJohan Melchior  \nDirector External Relations  \n+45 4060 1415  \njome@pandora.net  \n---|---  \n|  \nChristian M\u00f8ller  \nInvestor Relations Officer  \n+45 7219 5361  \nchmo@pandora.net |  \n  \n**Attachment**\n\n  * [Pandora_Company Announcement_No_584](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Z2kNqvyWNIhIPaQP9GJgRAYDldbFgp_J8vs6zn7PPdTZBO9TYo-luvjk-1YjRtERPdkIR3MTSSGtjLokbX_JgJdY7zNKzbWQ8gFWsg_z-FjfrqmW2l74jmP-G2feM8AaygroDXEL_R47GwIoHan1pb0ekRrMgqccQV90NS4Td_8NtQoRhn3hZ1XFi0J7X55c \"Pandora_Company Announcement_No_584\")\n\n## Related Articles\n\n##### More articles issued by _[Pandora\nA/S](/Search?organization=Pandora%20A%2FS)_\n\n##### More articles related to:\n\n#####  _[Regulatory information](/Search?sc=Regulatory%20information)_\n\n#####  _[European Regulatory News](/Search?sc=European%20Regulatory%20News)_\n\nProfile\n\n**Pandora A/S**\n\n[![](/Content/Images/rss-sub.png)  Subscribe via\nRSS](/SubscribeToRss/XQ-p4O_04ERGNhyFlpnqjw%3d%3d)\n\n  \n\n[![](/Content/Images/rss-sub.png) Subscribe via\nATOM](/SubscribeToAtom/XQ-p4O_04ERGNhyFlpnqjw%3d%3d)\n\n  \n\n[![](/Content/Images/rss-sub.png)\nJavascript](/JSWidget/organization/XQ-p4O_04ERGNhyFlpnqjw%3d%3d)\n\n![](/Content/Images/icon-location.png) Copenhagen V, DENMARK\n\nMedia Files\n\n[ ![Pandora_Company Announcement_No_584](/Content/Images/thumbnail-icons/icon-\npdf.gif?v=3202311)\n](/Attachment/DownloadAttachment?articleid=1994830&fileId=859876&filename=01-Pandora_Company%20Announcement_No_584.pdf&filetype=3&islogo=0)\n\n![](/Content/Images/icon-downloadimage.gif) [ **Pandora_Company\nAnnouncement_No_584**\n](http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/DownloadAttachment?articleid=1994830&fileId=859876&filename=01-Pandora_Company%20Announcement_No_584.pdf&filetype=3&islogo=0)\n\nFILE URL | Copy the link below\n\n![Pandora_Logo_Black_RGB_Screens.png](/news-\nrelease/logo/821657/0/821657.png?lastModified=09%2F02%2F2019%2011%3A05%3A22&size=4)\n\n![](/Content/Images/icon-downloadimage.gif)\n**Pandora_Logo_Black_RGB_Screens.png**\n\nLOGO URL | Copy the link below\n\n![Pandora_Logo_Black_RGB_Screens.png](/news-\nrelease/logo/821657/0/821657.png?lastModified=09%2F02%2F2019%2011%3A05%3A22&size=1)\n\nFormats available:\n\n  * Original \n  * Medium \n  * Small \n\n##### Newswire Distribution Network & Management\n\n  * [Home](/Index)\n  * [Newsroom](/NewsRoom)\n  * [RSS Feeds](/Rss/List)\n  * [Legal](/Home/about/Privacy)\n\n###### About Us\n\n**GlobeNewswire** is one of the world's largest newswire distribution\nnetworks, specializing in the delivery of corporate press releases financial\ndisclosures and multimedia content to the media, investment community,\nindividual investors and the general public.\n\n(C) 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc.

Introducing a new line of communication devices for the Asian\nmarket required reorienting its sales, marketing, and support functions.\nMigrating to cloud-based business applications called for changes to the IT\norganization. Altogether, it had reorganized six times in 10 years.\n\nSuddenly, however, the company found itself facing a different challenge.\nBecause of the new technologies that had entered its category, and a sea\nchange in customer expectations, the CEO decided to shift from a product-based\nbusiness model to a customer-centric one. That meant yet another\nreorganization, but this one would be different. It had to go beyond shifting\nthe lines and boxes in an org chart. It would have to change the company's\nmost fundamental building blocks: how people in the company made decisions,\nadopted new behaviors, rewarded performance, agreed on commitments, managed\ninformation, made sense of that information, allocated responsibility, and\nconnected with one another. Not only did the leadership team lack a full-\nfledged blueprint -- they didn't know where to begin.\n\nThis situation is becoming more typical. In the [18th annual PwC survey of\nchief executive officers](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/ceo-survey/index.html),\nconducted in 2014, many CEOs anticipated significant disruptions to their\nbusinesses during the next five years as a result of global trends. One such\ntrend, cited by 61 percent of the respondents, was heightened competition. The\nsame proportion of respondents foresaw changes in customer behavior creating\ndisruption. Fifty percent said they expected changes in distribution channels.\nAs CEOs look to stay ahead of these trends, they recognize the need to change\ntheir organization's design. But for that redesign to succeed, a company must\nmake its changes as effectively and painlessly as possible, in a way that\naligns with its strategy, invigorates employees, builds distinctive\ncapabilities, and makes it easier to attract customers.\n\nToday, the average tenure for the CEO of a global company is about five years.\nTherefore, a major re-organization is likely to happen only once during that\nleader's term. The chief executive has to get the reorg right the first time;\nhe or she won't get a second chance.\n\nThe chief executive has to get the reorg right the first time; he or she won't\nget a second chance.\n\nAlthough every company is different, and there is no set formula for\ndetermining the appropriate design for your organization, we have identified\n10 guiding principles that apply to every company. These have been developed\nthrough years of research and practice at PwC and Strategy&, using changes in\norganization design to improve performance in more than 400 companies across\nindustries and geographies. These fundamental principles point the way for\nleaders whose strategies require a different kind of organization than the one\nthey have today.\n\n**1\\. Declare amnesty for the past.** Organization design should start with\ncorporate self-reflection: What is your sense of purpose? How will you make a\ndifference for your clients, employees, and investors? What will set you apart\nfrom others, now and in the future? What differentiating capabilities will\nallow you to deliver your value proposition over the next two to five years?\n\nFor many business leaders, answering those questions means going beyond your\ncomfort zone. You have to set a bold direction, marshal the organization\ntoward that goal, and prioritize everything you do accordingly. Sustaining a\nforward-looking view is crucial.\n\n[![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/media/image/00318ab.gif)\n\nWe've seen a fair number of organization design initiatives fail to make a\ndifference because senior executives got caught up in discussing the pros and\ncons of the old organization. Avoid this situation by declaring \"amnesty for\nthe past.\" Collectively, explicitly decide that you will neither blame nor try\nto justify the design in place today or any organization designs of the past.\nIt's time to move on. This type of pronouncement may sound simple, but it's\nsurprisingly effective for keeping the focus on the new strategy.\n\n**2\\. Design with \"DNA.\"** Organization design can seem unnecessarily complex;\nthe right framework, however, can help you decode and prioritize the necessary\nelements. We have identified [eight universal building\nblocks](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/10minutes/organizational-dna.jhtml) that are\nrelevant to any company, regardless of industry, geography, or business model.\nThese building blocks will be the elements you put together for your design (\n_see Exhibit 1_ ).\n\n[![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/media/image/00318_ex1b.1.gif)\n\nThe blocks naturally fall into four complementary pairs, each made up of one\ntangible (or formal) and one intangible (or informal) element. Decisions are\npaired with norms (governing how people act), motivators with commitments\n(governing factors that affect people's feelings about their work),\ninformation with mind-sets (governing how they process knowledge and meaning),\nand structure with networks (governing how they connect). By using these\nelements and considering changes needed across each complementary pair, you\ncan create a design that will integrate your whole enterprise, instead of\npulling it apart.\n\nYou may be tempted to make changes with all eight building blocks\nsimultaneously. But too many interventions at once could interact in\nunexpected ways, leading to unfortunate side effects. Pick a small number of\nchanges -- five at most -- that you believe will deliver the greatest initial\nimpact. Even a few changes could involve many variations. For example, the\ndesign of motivators might need to vary from one function to the next. People\nin sales might be more heavily influenced by monetary rewards, whereas R&D\nstaffers might favor a career model with opportunities for self-directed\nprojects and external collaboration and education.\n\n**3\\. Fix the structure last, not first.** Company leaders know that their\ncurrent org chart doesn't necessarily capture the way things get done -- it's\nat best a vague approximation. Yet they still may fall into a common trap:\nthinking that changing their organization's structure will address their\nbusiness's problems.\n\nWe can't blame them -- after all, the org chart is seemingly the most powerful\ncommunications vehicle around. It also carries emotional weight, because it\ndefines reporting relationships that people might love or hate. But a company\nhierarchy, particularly when changes in the org chart are made in isolation\nfrom other changes, tends to revert to its earlier equilibrium. You can\nsignificantly remove management layers and temporarily reduce costs, but all\ntoo soon, the layers creep back in and the short-term gains disappear.\n\nIn an org redesign, you're not setting up a new form for the organization all\nat once. You're laying out a sequence of interventions that will lead the\ncompany from the past to the future. Structure should be the last thing you\nchange: the capstone, not the cornerstone, of that sequence. Otherwise, the\nchange won't sustain itself.\n\nWe saw the value of this approach recently with an industrial goods\nmanufacturer. In the past, it had undertaken reorganizations that focused\nalmost solely on structure, without ever achieving the execution improvement\nits leaders expected. Then the stakes grew higher: Fast-growing competitors\nemerged from Asia, technological advances compressed product cycles, and new\nbusiness models appeared that bypassed distributors. This time, instead of\nredrawing the lines and boxes, the company sought to understand the\norganizational factors that had slowed down its responses in the past. There\nwere problems in the way decisions were made and carried out, and in how\ninformation flowed. Therefore, the first changes in the sequence concerned\nthese building blocks: eliminating non-productive meetings (information),\nclarifying accountabilities in the matrix structure (decisions and norms), and\nchanging how people were rewarded (motivators). By the time the company was\nready to adjust the org chart, most of the problem factors had been addressed.\n\n**4\\. Make the most of top talent.** Talent is a critical but often overlooked\nfactor when it comes to org design. You might assume that the personalities\nand capabilities of existing executive team members won't affect the design\nmuch. But in reality, you need to design positions to make the most of the\nstrengths of the people who will occupy them. In other words, consider the\ntechnical skills and managerial acumen of key people, and make sure those\nleaders are equipped to foster the collaboration and empowerment needed from\npeople below them.\n\nYou must ensure that there is a connection between the capabilities you need\nand the leadership talent you have. For example, if you're organizing the\nbusiness on the basis of innovation and the ability to respond quickly to\nchanges in the market, the person chosen as chief marketing officer will need\na diverse background. Someone with a conventional marketing background whose\ncore skills center on low-cost pricing and extensive distribution might not be\ncomfortable in that role. You can sometimes compensate for a gap in\nproficiency through other team members. If the chief financial officer is an\nexcellent technician but has little leadership charisma, you may balance him\nor her with a chief operating officer who excels at the public-facing aspects\nof the role, such as speaking with analysts.\n\nAs you assemble the leadership team for your strategy, look for an optimal\nspan of control -- the number of direct reports -- for your senior executive\npositions. A Harvard Business School study conducted by [associate professor\nJulie\nWulf](https://securefiles.harvardbusiness.org/h-s/20130617/533337dce78f40c6)\nfound that CEOs have doubled their span of control over the past two decades.\nAlthough many executives have seven direct reports, there's no universal magic\nnumber. For CEOs, the optimal span of control depends on four factors: the\nCEO's tenure thus far, the degree of cross-collaboration among business units,\nthe level of CEO activity devoted to something other than working with direct\nreports, and whether the CEO is also chairman of the board. (We've created a\n[C-level span-of-control\ndiagnostic](http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/global/home/what_we_do/services/ocl/ocl_thought_leadership/structure_at_the_top/span-\nof-control-diagnostic) to help determine your target span.)\n\n**5\\. Focus on what you can control.** Make a list of the things that hold\nyour organization back: the scarcities (things you consistently find in short\nsupply) and constraints (things that consistently slow you down). Taking stock\nof real-world limitations helps ensure that you can execute and sustain the\nnew organization design.\n\nFor example, consider the impact you might face if 20 percent of the people\nwho had the most knowledge and expertise in making and marketing your core\nproducts -- your product launch talent -- were drawn away for three years on a\nregulatory project. How would that talent shortage affect your product launch\ncapability, especially if it involved identifying and acting on customer\ninsights? How might you compensate for this scarcity? Doubling down on\naddressing typical scarcities, or what is \"not good enough,\" helps prioritize\nthe changes to your organization model. For example, you may build a product\nlaunch center of excellence to address the typical scarcity of never having\nenough of the people who know how to execute effective launches.\n\nConstraints on your business -- such as regulations, supply shortages, and\nchanges in customer demand -- may be out of your control. But don't get bogged\ndown in trying to change something you can't change; instead, focus on\nchanging what you can. For example, if your company is a global consumer\npackaged goods manufacturer, you might first favor a single structure with\nclear decision rights on branding, policies, and usage guidelines because it\nis more efficient in global branding. But if consumer tastes for your product\nare different around the world, you might be better off with a structure that\ndelegates decision rights to the local business leader.\n\n[![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/media/image/00318_ex2b.1.gif)\n\n**6\\. Promote accountability.** Design your organization so that it's easy for\npeople to be accountable for their part of the work without being\nmicromanaged. Make sure that decision rights are clear and that information\nflows rapidly and clearly from the executive committee to business units,\nfunctions, and departments. Our research underscores the importance of this\nfactor: We analyzed dozens of companies with strong execution and found that\namong the formal building blocks, information and decision rights had the\nstrongest effect on improving the execution of strategy. They are about twice\nas powerful as an organization's structure or its motivators ( _see Exhibit 2_\n).\n\nA global electronics manufacturer was struggling with slow execution and lack\nof accountability. To address these issues, it created a matrix that could\nidentify those who had made important decisions in the past few years. It then\nused the matrix to establish clear decision rights and motivators more in tune\nwith the company's desired goals. Sales directors were made accountable for\ndealers in their region and were evaluated in terms of the sales performance\nof those dealers. This encouraged ownership and high performance on both\nsides, and drew in critically important but previously isolated groups, like\nthe manufacturer's warranty function. The company operationalized these new\ndecision rights by establishing the necessary budget authorities, decision-\nmaking forums, and communications.\n\nWhen decision rights and motivators are established, accountability can take\nhold. Gradually, people get in the habit of following through on commitments\nwithout experiencing formal enforcement. Even after it becomes part of the\ncompany's culture, this new accountability must be continually nurtured and\npromoted. It won't endure if, for example, [new additions to the firm don't\nhonor commitments](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00267) or\nincentives change in a way that undermines the desired behavior.\n\n**7\\. Benchmark sparingly, if at all.** One common misstep is looking for best\npractices. In theory, it can be helpful to track what competitors are doing,\nif only to help you optimize your own design or uncover issues requiring\nattention. But in practice, this approach has a couple of problems.\n\nFirst, it ignores your organization's unique capabilities system -- the\nstrengths that only your organization has, which produces results that others\ncan't match. You and your competitor aren't likely to need the same\ndistinctive capabilities, even if you're in the same industry. For example,\ntwo banks might look similar on the surface; they might have branches next\ndoor to each other in several locales. But the first could be a national bank\ncatering to millennials, who are drawn to low costs and innovative online\nbanking features. The other could be regionally oriented, serving an older\ncustomer base and emphasizing community ties and personalized customer\nservice. Those different value propositions would require different\ncapabilities and translate into different organization designs. The national\nbank might be organized primarily by customer segment, making it easy to\ninvest in a single leading-edge technology that covers all regions and all\nmarkets. The regional bank might be organized primarily by geography, setting\nup managers to build better relationships with local leaders and enterprises.\nIf you benchmark the wrong example, the copied organizational model will only\nset you back.\n\nSecond, even if you share the same strategy as a competitor, who's to say that\nits organization is a good fit with its strategy? If your competitor has a\ndifferent value proposition or capabilities system than you do, using it as a\ncomparison for your own performance will be a mistake.\n\nIf you feel you must benchmark, focus on a few select elements, rather than\ntrying to be best in class in everything related to your industry. Your choice\nof companies to follow, and of the indicators to track and analyze, should\nline up exactly with the capabilities you prioritized in setting your future\ncourse. For example, if you are expanding into emerging markets, you might\nbenchmark the extent to which leading companies in that region give local\noffices decision rights on sourcing or distribution.\n\n**8\\. Let the \"lines and boxes\" fit your company's purpose.** For every\ncompany, there is an optimal pattern of hierarchical relationship -- a golden\nmean. It isn't the same for every company; it should reflect the strategy you\nhave chosen, and it should support the critical capabilities that distinguish\nyour company. That means that the right structure for one company will not be\nthe same as the right structure for another, even if they're in the same\nindustry.\n\nIn particular, think through your purpose when designing the spans of control\nand layers in your org chart. These should be fairly consistent across the\norganization.\n\nYou can often hasten the flow of information and create greater accountability\nby reducing layers. But if the structure gets too flat, your leaders have to\nsupervise an overwhelming number of people. You can free up management time by\nadding staff, but if the pyramid becomes too steep, it will be hard to get\nclear messages from the bottom to the top. So take the nature of your\nenterprise into account. Does the work at your company require close\nsupervision? What role does technology play? How much collaboration is\ninvolved? How far-flung are people geographically, and what is their preferred\nmanagement style?\n\nIn a call center, 15 or 20 people might report to a single manager because the\nwork is routine and heavily automated. An enterprise software implementation\nteam, made up of specialized knowledge workers, would require a narrower span\nof control, such as six to eight employees. If people regularly take on\nstretch assignments and broadly participate in decision making, you might have\na narrower hierarchy -- more managers directing only a few people each --\ninstead of setting up managers with a large number of direct reports.\n\n**9\\. Accentuate the informal.** Formal elements like structure and\ninformation are attractive to companies because they're tangible. They can be\neasily defined and measured. But they're only half the story. Many companies\nreassign decision rights, rework the org chart, or set up knowledge-sharing\nsystems -- yet don't see the results they expect.\n\nThat's because they've ignored the more informal, intangible building blocks.\nNorms, commitments, mind-sets, and networks are essential in getting things\ndone. They represent (and influence) the ways people think, feel, communicate,\nand behave. When these intangibles are not in sync with one another or the\nmore tangible building blocks, the organization falters.\n\nAt one technology company, it was common practice to have multiple \"meetings\nbefore the meeting\" and \"meetings after the meeting.\" In other words, the\nconstructive debate and planning took place outside the formal presentations\nthat were known as the \"official meetings.\" The company had long relied on its\ninformal networks because people needed workarounds to many official rules.\nNow, as part of the redesign, the leaders of the company embraced its informal\nnature, adopting new decision rights and norms that allowed the company to\nmove more fluidly, and abandoning official channels as much as possible.\n\n**10\\. Build on your strengths.** Overhauling the organization is one of the\nhardest things for a chief executive or division leader to do, especially if\nhe or she is charged with turning around a poorly performing company. But\nthere are always strengths to build on in existing practices and in the\nculture. Suppose, for example, that your company has a norm of customer-\noriented commitment. Employees are willing to go the extra mile for customers\nwhen called upon to do so. They deliver work out of scope or ahead of\nschedule, often because they empathize with the problems customers face. You\ncan draw attention to that behavior by setting up groups to talk about it, and\nreinforce the behavior by rewarding it with more formal incentives. That will\nhelp spread it throughout the company.\n\nPerhaps your company has well-defined decision rights, wherein each person has\na good idea of the decisions and actions for which he or she is responsible.\nYet in your current org design, they may not be focused on the right things.\nYou can use this strong accountability and redirect people to the right\ndecisions to support the new strategy.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA [2014 Strategy&\nsurvey](http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/global/home/press/displays/concerns-\nexecutives-strategy-execution-gap) found that 42 percent of executives felt\nthat their organization was not aligned with the strategy, and that parts of\nthe organization resisted it or didn't understand it. If that's a familiar\nproblem in your company, the principles in this article can help you develop\nan organization design that supports your most distinctive capabilities and\nsupports your strategy more effectively.\n\nRemaking your organization to align with your strategy is a project that only\nthe top executive of a company, division, or enterprise can lead. Although\nit's not practical for a CEO to manage the day-to-day details, the top leader\nof a company must be consistently present to work through the major issues and\nalternatives, focus the design team on the future, and be accountable for the\ntransition to the new organization. The chief executive will also set the tone\nfor future updates: Changes in technology, customer preferences, and other\ndisruptors will continually test your business model.\n\nThese 10 fundamental principles can serve as your guideposts for any\nreorganization, large or small. Armed with these collective lessons, you can\navoid common missteps and home in on the right blueprint for your business.\n![](/media/image/end_of_story.gif)\n\nReprint No. 00318\n\n## Author Profiles:\n\n  * **[Gary L.

These concepts and ideas are taken from my book,\n_[The Future of Work: Attract New Talent, Build Better Leaders, and Create a\nCompetitive\nOrganization](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118877241/?tag=wwwwileycom-20\n\"the future of work\")_.

[Flatarchies](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/07/15/the-5-types-of-organizational-structures-part-4-flatarchies/ \"flatarchies\") (part 4 is already available)\n  5. [Holacratic organizations](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/07/20/the-5-types-of-organizational-structures-part-5-holacratic-organizations/ \"holacratic organizations\") (part 5 is already available)\n\nLet's start with the structure we have all come to know and love...the\nhierarchy.\n\nI've talked about [several workplace practices and approaches that are quite\nout-dated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQgRhTzx1yA \"out of date workplace\npractices\") and the hierarchy is one of them. According to Wikipedia,\n\"possibly the first use of the English word \"hierarchy\" cited by the Oxford\nEnglish Dictionary was in 1880, when it was used in reference to the three\norders of three angels as depicted by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (5th\u20136th\ncenturies).\" This model was quickly adopted by the military as a way to show a\nchain of command and of course we have all seen and experienced this within\nour organizations (and most still do).\n\nThis type of a model makes sense for linear work where no brain power is\nrequired and where the people who work there are treated like expendable cogs.\nHowever, as the war for talent continues to become more fierce, organizations\naround the world are quickly trying to figure out alternatives to the\nhierarchy. In fact, every single organization I speak with, work with, and\nresearch, is looking to flatten out their structure. Nobody ever tells me they\nwant more bureaucracy and more layers.\n\nThere are many challenges with this model but to name a few. Communication\ntypically flows from the top to the bottom which means innovation stagnates,\nengagement suffers, and collaboration is virtually non-existent. This type of\nenvironment is riddled with bureaucracy and is extremely sluggish. This is why\nthe hierarchy is perhaps the biggest vulnerability for any organization still\nemploying it. It opens up the doors for competitors and new incumbents to\nquickly take over. There is also no focus on the employee experience in this\ntype of a structure and as organizations around the world are exploring\nalternative organizational models, those still stuck with the hierarchy are\ngoing to have one heck of a time trying to attract and retain top talent.\n\nThe hierarchy has permeated virtually every company around the world\nregardless of size, industry, or location. The greatest strength of the\nhierarchy used to be that it was so reliable at maintain the status quo, which\nwas exactly what companies wanted decades ago. However what was once it's\nstrength is now it's greatest weakness. The hierarchy is a very resilient\nmanagement structure that has been so embedded in how we work that most\norganizations around the world are having a tedious time getting rid of it.\n\nToday one thing is certain, the hierarchy belongs in a management museum\nlocked up for people to see, but not touch.\n\nIn part 2 of this post I'll explore what is perhaps the most practical and\nscalable organizational model, the \"flatter\" organization.\n\n_Jacob Morgan is a keynote speaker, author (most recently of The Future of\nWork), and futurist.

\n\n![](//cmg.scdn4.secure.raxcdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/600x360/news/Singapore\nbuildings at night_1.jpg)\n\n# Startups boost HR tech momentum in Singapore\n\nWill you hire bots to interview potential employees?\n\nAlthough future-proofing the workforce remains a key component of Singapore's\nnational digital blueprint, the broad-based digitalisation drive has not\nspared recruiters responsible for the unenviable task of managing the city\nstate's limited human resources that remain crucial to achieving the city's\nvision.\n\nAmidst the Lion City's chronic manpower problems, human resources technology\n(HR tech) which could range from chatbots to data-driven employee technologies\nto the automation of administrative labour like evaluations systems, talent\nrequest and onboarding process, hold the promise that could easily pave the\nway for the future of work.\n\n**Also read** : [Can tech solve Singapore's talent and manpower\ncrunch?](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/in-focus/can-tech-solve-singapores-\ntalent-and-manpower-crunch)\n\nOne such startup disrupting the local HR space is\n[PeopleWave](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/exclusive/hr-software-startup-\npeoplewave-strengthens-funding-stream-500000-seed-round), whose products\ninclude a data-driven employee appraisal system and dashboard displaying an\norganisation's performance as it aims to capitalise on the growing recognition\nof the business value of data-driven people management and analytics.\n\n\"CEOs and HR leaders have long embraced new technology but it's only now that\nHR tech is catching up,\" **Damien Cummings** , Peoplewave CEO told _Singapore\nBusiness Review_. \"Marketers are data-driven and sales leaders are using\nSalesforce but HR hasn't had the same level of tool, until now.\"\n\nOver the past five years, capital injections into global HR tech startups have\nbeen steadily growing from US$413m in 2012 to a record US$2.22b in 2016,\naccording to market intelligence platform CB Insights.\n\nOn the local level, Singapore's HR tech market is trailing slightly behind US\nand other Western countries as it's still in the process of moving away from\ncompliance-driven tools including payroll and leave management towards tools\nthat are able to provide actionable insights and make HR more of a business\nfunction, observed Cummings.\n\n**Also read** : [DBS rolls out virtual bank\nrecruiter](https://sbr.com.sg/financial-services/news/dbs-rolls-out-virtual-\nbank-recruiter)\n\nArmed with curated workforce insights, companies are therefore able to make\ninformed decisions on recruitment, employee assessment, workforce planning,\n[employee engagement and retention](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-\neducation/news/chart-day-expected-turnover-rate-in-singapore-highest-in-asia).\n\n\"Given the business friendliness of Singapore, many HR tech players [have]\ncome in and they help to drive the vibrancy of the ecosystem,\" according to\n**Adrian Tan** , co-founder of HR consultancy firm The Resource Group, who\nforecasted that a more solid usage of AI beyond chatbots is set to overtake\nthe prevailing trend of data-powered analytics for predictive reasons over the\nnext few years.\n\nThe application of blockchain technology is also another developing trend in\nthe HR tech scene, observed ManpowerGroup Singapore country manager  **Linda\nTeo** , especially as the distributed ledger technology enables companies to\nverify credentials in a more credible and secure manner.\n\nIndorse is one such startup as it [leverages on blockchain\ntechnology](https://sbr.com.sg/information-technology/exclusive/blockchain-\npowered-social-media-start-indorse-raises-10m-in-recent-) to build a social\nnetwork similar to LinkedIn. Unlike traditional social media platforms,\nhowever, where users can make any claim regarding their skills set or work\nexperience, Indorse members need to attach proof of their claim which will\nthen be 'indorsed' or verified by other users in the same domain.\n\n**Defying disruption**  \nSingapore has been globally recognised as the third most prepared country for\nthe wave of intelligent automation, trailing only behind South Korea and\nGermany in The Economist's Automation Readiness Index.\n\nBeyond [periodic skills upgrading](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-\neducation/news/participation-in-work-related-learning-jumped-48-in-2018)\nthrough the governments SkillsFuture programme, the Lion City is also actively\ntapping on disruptive technologies like AI and robotics to future-proof all\naspects of business against the [threat of disruption](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-\neducation/more-news/half-singapore-workers-threatened-digitalisation-will-\nsnatch-their-jobs) including its most valuable asset - human resources.\n\nMuch of the interest in adopting HR tech largely comes from the startup sector\nwhere manpower and resource are a common issue hampering growth, according to\nEngageRocket founder CEO **CheeTung Leong** whose firm automates the\nadministration and analytics behind employee surveys to analyse employee\nfeedback in real-time.\n\n\"Generally well-funded startup are early adopters, followed by foreign MNCs,\nlocal banks, SME with 2nd/3rd gen owners, local MNCS, SMEs with original\nowners in this exact sequence,\" echoed Tan.\n\nWith the ongoing digitisation of the bulk of HR work, are recruiters at risk\nof being displaced by chatbots and predictive analytics too? Analysts believe\nthis won't be the case as much of the recruitment and employee assessment work\nis still hinged on the importance of human judgment and expertise although\nPeoplewave's Cummings believes that the model is likely to be nimbler and\nwould feature more subscription models, software license fees and consulting\nengagements in the future.\n\n\"It's in a company's best interest to have an all-round approach that does not\nonly include the latest technologies, but also prioritises the human expertise\nthat recruitment consultants provide,\" said Robert Half Singapore managing\ndirector **Matthieu Imbert-Bouchard**. \"There is just no substitute for real-\nworld interaction and human judgements when it comes to finding and securing\nthe right talent.\"\n\nAlthough digital recruiters could be used to perform the screening process for\na bulk of entry-level jobs, senior roles that attract a niche talent pool\ncannot be filtered and judged by a bot as such tasks still need the handling\nof an experienced HR manager.\n\n\"Within the HR function, firms have been mindful of the extent to which they\nshould automate or digitise this function,\" according to **Shinjika Shukla** ,\nassociate director, Michael Page Singapore. \"In situations such as employee\ngrievances, employee interaction with chatbots may not solve the purpose.\"\n\nIn fact, a survey by the ManpowerGroup Solutions reveals that almost a fifth\n(19%) of jobseekers still opt for in-person interviews, indicating that\ncandidates still place premium on face-to-face meetings despite the pool of\navailable technology.\n\n\"As important as it has been for organisations to implement technology\nsolutions within their HR functions, employers are mindful that this function\nrequires human touch points from time to time without which it may lose its\neffectiveness,\" Shukla added.\n\nIn order to keep pace with Singapore's smart vision targets, recruitment teams\nhave actually been forging closer partnerships with HR tech players so that\nthey are able to direct their energies towards higher value types of work.\n\n\"HR teams are actively looking at how AI assistants can play an active role in\nthe recruitment process from initial candidate filtering all the way to the\ninterview, offer and on-boarding process,\" according to **Lee Jin Hian** ,\nfounder & CEO, Evie.ai, an AI-powered assistant that can be used to schedule\nmeetings and interviews, track to-do lists and book meeting rooms.\n\nTime and cost also continue to drive the business priorities of HR managers\nand only through such collaborations with tech players will they be able to\nmeet business targets and withstand the digital disruption.\n\n\"The smartest recruitment networks are investing in or collaborating with HR\ntech vendors. Whilst it's not mainstream yet, within the next 2 years all\ncandidates will be using agency endorsed software for applying to new jobs,\ngoing through background assessment, preparing for their first day on the job\nand being managed through their first 100 days in the new role,\" said\nCummings.\n\nWith consulting firm Korn Ferry estimating Singapore to be amongst those\npoised to be the [hardest hit by a global talent\nshortage](https://sbr.com.sg/hr-education/news/singapore-could-\nlose-14251b-talent-crunch), any solution that could give recruiters more time\nto look for value-adding candidates in a shrinking talent pool is a welcome\ndevelopment.\n\nHowever, companies need to forge greater industry ties in order to avoid\nredundant HR tech solutions, suggested The Resource Group's Tan. \"Singapore\nbusiness will only stand to benefit from the myriad of new choices. But the\nmarket is still small. This require deeper collaboration between providers to\nintegrate with each other so that customers need not remember 10 logins to\nsolve 10 problems.\"\n\nDo you know more about this story?

Starting out as a production planner, you quickly moved into an HR role\nwith Apple when you started your career more than 20 years ago. What attracted\nyou to HR?**\n\nHR is such a multi-faceted field which fulfils both my passion to work with\npeople and the desire to always improve and make things better \u2013 be it in\nrecruiting and retaining talent, making HR processes more efficient or\ndeveloping a more robust development and benefits plan for the organisation.\nThere is never a dull moment, and there are a lot of different things to do\nand see and I get to meet different people and experience diverse cultures.\n\nI also enjoy the ever-changing settings of not knowing exactly what my day\nwill bring and the surprises that may come my way which I thrive on. All in\nall, this is an extremely rewarding and exciting career to be in.\n\n**Q. Since then, you have spent a lot of time in heavy industries such as\nKeppel FELS, Eastman Chemical, and now Amgen. What is unique about HR in this\nsector?**\n\nThe biggest commonality are all these industries are highly niche with each\nrequiring a large number of extremely skilled workforces to perform very\nspecific roles and in shifts. Most of these companies are also located in what\nis usually deemed as less \u201ccentral\u201d and \u201caccessible\u201d locations so it does take\nHR more effort to develop creative programmes to draw and retain talent.\n\nHR practitioners in this sector also need to have experience working from a\ncorporate centralised HR level, but to also have a sound knowledge of all the\nlaws pertaining to the manufacturing industry \u2013 such as implementing and\nsuggesting policies for different types of employees, in understanding the\nexisting skills of employees and having a good view of the various types of\nfuture skills needed to align with the business strategy specifically for the\nmanufacturing industry.\n\n**Q. What has been the most memorable HR initiative you\u2019ve been a part of in\nyour career?**\n\nThat would certainly have to be a new organisational structure I designed and\nimplemented to support a more effective and efficient delivery of valued-added\nHR services for both the commercial and manufacturing offices. Though\nconstrained by lean resources, we leveraged on the power of technology and\nimplemented the programme across nine countries which impacted over a thousand\nemployees in Asia Pacific.\n\n> ##### It is necessary we not only offer a competitive development and\n> benefits plan, but also a structured career roadmap to retain our top\n> talent.\n\n**Q. At Amgen, what are the HR priorities that keep you awake at night? What\nrole does HR play for the business?**\n\nAt Amgen, our mission to serve patients drives all that we do. As a HR\nbusiness partner, we partner closely with site leaders to create a competitive\nadvantage through an agile and differentiated workforce strategy. This means\nensuring we have the right people in the right roles and location at the right\ntime to drive our \u201cbest place for talent\u201d initiatives that meet local needs\nwhile remaining aligned with global strategies.\n\nGiven the complex and dynamic nature of the future of manufacturing and with\nnew disruptive technologies emerging, we always need to innovate faster to be\nahead of the game and to constantly evolve our strategies to achieve a highly\nengaged and motivated world-class workforce.\n\n**Q. In the recent National Day rally, Singapore\u2019s PM Lee highlighted diabetes\nas a rising concern for the nation. How do you motivate your team of\nresearchers to find the next medical breakthrough? What do they value most?**\n\nAs with the rest of our global workforce, Amgen scientists are motivated\nthrough our shared mission of helping patients. As a biotechnology pioneer,\nAmgen scientists are designing new types of medicines with novel capabilities\nand innovative manufacturing capabilities that push the boundaries of science\nto develop a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential and to launch new\nmedicines at unprecedented rates to reach millions of patients worldwide.\n\nBy employing a \u201cbiology first\u201d approach, our world-class talent utilises the\nindustry\u2019s largest toolkit of modalities, and leverages industry-leading\npartnerships and state-of-the-art technology to develop new processes and\nproducts to turn the tide of serious and life-interrupting illnesses.\n\nOur next-generation biomanufacturing facility located in Singapore is also\nanother great example of a new biomanufacturing paradigm that is leaner,\ngreener, more flexible and productive, and less costly to build and operate\ncompared with a conventional manufacturing facility. This high value-added\ninnovative manufacturing has provided Amgen with improved productivity, speed\nand flexibility to which a drug is available for patients.\n\n**Q. Recently, there has been a lot of talk about the lack of talent in the\nhealthcare sector. Does this spill over to the biotech sector as well,\nespecially since you have two manufacturing facilities in the nation? If so,\nhow do you manage this challenge?**\n\nBiomedical manufacturing is a key contributor to the overall manufacturing\nsector, which last year accounted for one-fifth of Singapore\u2019s gross domestic\nproduct. The sector has grown rapidly over the past few years and we expect\ncontinued strong interest. It is necessary we not only offer a competitive\ndevelopment and benefits plan, but also a comprehensive structured career\nroadmap and programme to retain our top talent.\n\nPartnering key stakeholders such as the Singapore Economic Development Board\nand Workforce Singapore, Amgen plays an active role to build a pipeline of\nprofessionals for Singapore\u2019s biologics manufacturing sector through talent\nand manpower development programmes such as the development and apprenticeship\nprogramme.\n\nThrough our Amgen Foundation signature programme, we also proactively seek to\nadvance excellence in science education to inspire and groom our next\ngeneration of innovators through programmes such as Amgen Biotech Experience\nand Amgen Scholars at local schools and universities to spark their interest\nand a future career in STEM.\n\n> ##### Amgen\u2019s new manager assimilation programme is a mandatory training\n> that eligible people managers have to complete within a year of starting in\n> the role.\n\n**Q. Can you describe one HR campaign at Amgen that you believe non-\nmanufacturing corporations can learn a lot from?**\n\nThere probably is no hotter topic in the world of global business than talent.\nAmgen\u2019s global new manager assimilation programme is a mandatory training that\nall eligible people managers have to participate and complete within a year of\nstarting in the role. The curriculum empowers new managers with tacit skills,\nincluding coaching on how to manage a group of workers, on effective\ncommunications, how to manage projects, and so forth, that can usually only be\nlearnt mainly on-the-job and through real-life experience.\n\nThrough this structured programme, we equip new managers with the management\nskills so that the risks of failure are minimised and as a way to keep\nattracting and retaining talent who report under them.\n\n**Q. Is there someone in your career who has inspired you or mentored you? If\nso, what is the number one thing they always told you?**\n\nI have had several HR mentors throughout my career. The key takeaway is not to\nbe complacent, but to always apply continuous learning to stay current and\nahead to step up to the challenges of a disruptive world. That said, keeping\noneself adaptable and resilient are also important attributes to avoid\nbecoming irrelevant.\n\n**Q. How do you spend your free time or your weekends?**\n\nI enjoy running, travelling, surfing the net, reading, watching _National\nGeographic_ programmes, chauffeuring my daughter for her weekend classes and\ngoing for walks with my wife in nature parks.\n\n**Q. What\u2019s the one myth you would bust about working in HR?**\n\nOne myth is that HR is a back room function. As a matter of fact, HR is now in\nthe forefront of corporate strategy. As HR professionals develop a strategic\nmindset and possess the knowledge and skills needed to shape an organisation\nworkforce and effectiveness, they become key players in charting the\norganisation\u2019s path.\n\n_Photo / Provided_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

The former claim that a matrix structure slows\ndecision making and obfuscates accountability. The latter retort that a matrix\nstructure is an inescapable prerequisite for lateral coordination in large\ncomplex businesses. From our two decades of experience with organization\ndesign, we tend to side with the latter. In fact, we may even belong to a\nthird camp, those who love to love the matrix. But our love is conditional\nupon its sparing and wise use.\n\nLet\u2019s get back to first principles first. Just in case you\u2019ve forgotten, a\nmanager in a matrix organization has two or more upward reporting lines to\nbosses who each represent a different business dimension, such as product,\nregion, customer, capability, or function. It\u2019s often a response to, or a\nprophylactic against, corporate silos. Silos can form in any company,\nregardless of how it\u2019s organized, whether that\u2019s around different products,\ndifferent regions, or different types of customers. When a company\nreorganizes, it\u2019s often because the strategy has also changed. For example,\nthe French global energy player\n[ENGIE](http://www.engie.com/en/journalists/press-releases/transformation-\nterritories-challenge-worldwide-energy-revolution/) recently tilted its\nprimary dimension from product (such as power, services, and infrastructure)\ntoward region in order to better serve its clients in the territories in which\nit operates. Likewise, the British communications services company [BT\nGroup](http://www.btplc.com/news/index.cfm#/pressreleases/bt-announces-new-\nstructure-1304769) recently tilted from product toward customer (such as\nconsumer, business, and public sector). But such reorgs don\u2019t make silos go\naway \u2014 they just create new ones. So it remains crucial to ensure lateral\ncoordination between the various units.\n\nLateral coordination is accomplished rather easily at the top of a company.\nThe executives in charge of the various groups sit together naturally in the\ntop management team. Often, they are also incentivized for the company\u2019s well-\nbeing as a whole.\n\nBut obviously the top management team cannot afford to let all day-to-day\noperational coordination issues escalate upward. Its real challenge is to\nachieve lateral coordination also at the levels below. This can be achieved\nthrough hard-wiring or soft-wiring. A matrix structure is an example of hard-\nwiring, because the two bosses of a manager in a matrixed position have the\njoint responsibility to set his objectives, supervise his work, do his\nappraisal, and ensure his development. For example, the procurement manager of\na business unit would report both to the business unit head and to the\ncorporate procurement officer.\n\nSoft-wiring relies on more informal, organic, voluntary, temporary, or one-off\ninstruments, such as an ad-hoc multi-dimensional task force, an annual\ncorporate planning cycle, an advisory council, a central coordination\nfunction, or a company-wide knowledge management system. For example, the U.S.\noilfield services company\n[Schlumberger](http://www.slb.com/news/inside_news/2015/2015_1211_enterprising_knowledge.aspx)\nbuilds on its knowledge management system to share technical expertise across\nregions and products.\n\nExecutives who are fundamentally opposed to a matrix do not argue that there\u2019s\nno need for lateral coordination. They simply consider that soft-wiring can do\nthe job all by itself. Whenever there is a real need in the field for\ncoordination across organizational silos, the managers concerned will find\neach other. A matrix, they argue, needlessly complicates things. Patrick De\nMaeseneire, the former CEO of the Swiss HR solutions provider Adecco,\nformulates it as follows: \u201cNo complicated matrix structures. One man or woman.\nOne number. In matrix structures, everybody claims a success as his and points\nto everybody else when things go wrong.\u201d\n\nWe would argue that it is not an either/or issue. Provided that the hard-wired\nmatrix is deployed sparingly and wisely, it has its place in the arsenal of\nmanagement tools along with soft-wired ones. Here are five practical\nguidelines.\n\n**1\\. Adopt when purposeful.** The matrix should not be the default design\noption. It should be used only when two conditions are met. First, when there\nis a major need for middle managers of different units or teams to coordinate\non important business matters on a daily basis. For example, when the finance\nmanager of a region has to coordinate intensely with the heads of the country\nsubsidiaries in that region, it may make sense to put the business controller\nof each subsidiary in a matrixed position, that is, to have each of these\nreport not only to their respective subsidiary head but also the region\nfinance manager. The second condition for a matrix is that the required\ncoordination cannot be achieved adequately through soft-wiring only. For\nexample, if you are in a fairly steady business with fairly autonomous country\nsubsidiaries selling either standard or strictly local products, something\nlike a quarterly \u201ccountry coordination council\u201d may be sufficient.\n\n**2\\. Keep intrinsic conflict out.**\n[Research](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969593112001047)\nby Joachim Wolf and William G. Egelhoff shows that the likelihood of intra-\norganizational conflict in a matrix structure depends on the groups involved.\nFor example, a matrix with region and function as organizing principles tends\nto have lower levels of conflict than a matrix with region and product as\norganizing principles. The reason is easily understood: region and function\nhave more complementary roles and objectives than region and product have. If\nboth region and product have P&L responsibility and are expected to manage the\nsame factors (human resources, customer relationships, price levels, etc.) to\noptimize their performance, conflict is baked into the matrix. Therefore, when\ndefining the roles and accountabilities of the two matrix dimensions, make\nsure there are intrinsic reasons for them to collaborate rather than to\ncompete.\n\n**3\\. Limit breadth and depth.** A matrix may contain more than two organizing\nprinciples (e.g., product + region + function). But since a matrix with two\nsuch principles is difficult enough to manage, stick to two unless there is an\noverwhelming argument to broaden beyond two, such as in a particularly complex\npart of the business. A trickier issue is how deep down the hierarchy to\nreplicate the matrix. We would advocate avoiding nested matrices. Continuing\nthe aforementioned example of the subsidiary controller, \u201cnested\u201d means that\nthe risk manager reporting to the matrixed subsidiary controller would also\nreport to the regional risk manager who in turn reports to the regional\nfinance manager. If grasping the preceding sentence is already quite\nchallenging, imagine how difficult it would be to make the concept work in\npractice.\n\n**4\\. Don\u2019t pretend.** The previous three guidelines are a call for the spare\nuse of a matrix. But once you have opted for one, go all the way. Ban the oft-\nused distinction between a dotted and full reporting line, implying that the\nformer carries less weight. Position the two reporting lines of a matrixed\nmanager as fully balanced \u2014 that is, 50-50, not 70-30 or some other unequal\nratio. (Don\u2019t even use a dotted line to distinguish between different\nreporting lines on the org chart. Use full lines in different colors.)\nLikewise, don\u2019t degrade the joint objective setting and performance appraisal\nof a matrixed manager into an almost perfunctory ritual whereby one of the two\nbosses actually takes care of it, merely soliciting some final secondary\ncomments from the other boss. Messages or practices that appear to detract\nfrom the fundamental philosophy of the matrix are lethal because the\neffectiveness of a matrix depends on its credibility.\n\n**5\\. Escalate by exception only.** A common complaint about a matrix\nstructure is that it increases upward reporting and slows decision making. The\nopposite should be true in a well-functioning matrix because it pushes\noperational decision making down in a controlled way. Suppose product and\nregion are the two organizing principles. When a decision is to be made about\nsome minor regional product adaptation, the regional product manager should be\nable to make that judgment without escalating the issue to a global product\nmanager and the regional business unit head, let alone to even more senior\nexecutives. It is up to the higher levels to refuse unwarranted upward\nescalation of trade-offs and conflicts.\n\nNothing in business is perfect, and all organizational structures involve\ntrade-offs. If you\u2019re implementing a matrix at your company, start small,\nlearn, and fine-tune as you progress. There is not a one-size-fits-all\nsolution. How far you implement a matrix depends on the maturity of your\norganization, i.e., its ability to understand that a seemingly complex and\nambiguous setup can in fact improve the quality and speed of decision making.\nClear communication and consistent behavior are required to dispel the\nmatrixed manager\u2019s anxiety about roles conflict and the boss\u2019s fear of losing\npower. Ultimately, your organization will gain enough trust in the matrix to\nlet it do its work, evolving from reluctant acceptance to full-hearted\nembrace, sensing the matrix is there without noticing it.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2014/01/110-Herman-Vantrappen.jpg)\n\n[Herman Vantrappen](/search?term=herman%20vantrappen&search_type=search-all)\nis the Managing Director of Akordeon, a strategic advisory firm based in\nBrussels.

Yet employees report more disrespectful and uncivil behavior each\nyear. This disconnect happens in large part because leaders have an incomplete\nunderstanding of what constitutes workplace respect--and so even well-meaning\nefforts to provide it often fall short.\n\nThe author's research shows that employees value two distinct types of\nrespect. _Owed respect_ is accorded equally to all members of a work group or\norganization. It's signaled by civility and an atmosphere suggesting that\nevery member is inherently valuable. _Earned respect_ recognizes individual\nemployees who display valued qualities or behaviors.\n\nTo better understand the two types of respect, the author spent 15 months\nstudying a unique work program for female prison inmates--a context that\nsharply highlights the differences between a respectful environment and a\ndisrespectful one. At Televerde, a B2B marketing firm, regular displays of\nowed and earned respect have created an extraordinarily engaged workforce\nresponsible for impressive profitability and growth, and recidivism among\nTeleverde's inmate employees is 80% lower than the national average.\n\nAlthough Televerde operates in an unusual context, its employees' need for\nrespect is universal. The author details seven ways in which leaders and\nmanagers can convey owed and earned respect and thus build a workplace that\nallows employees--and, as a result, their companies--to become the best\npossible versions of themselves.\n\n#### In Brief\n\n##### The Deficit\n\nA respectful workplace brings enormous benefits to organizations, but efforts\nto provide one often fall short. That\u2019s partly because leaders have an\nincomplete understanding of respect.\n\n##### The Fix\n\nResearch shows that employees value two distinct types of respect. _Owed\nrespect_ is accorded equally to all members of a work group or an\norganization. _Earned respect_ recognizes individuals who display valued\nqualities or behaviors and acknowledges that each employee has specific\nstrengths and talents.\n\n##### The Idea in Practice\n\nAt Televerde, a technology-focused B2B marketing firm staffed by female prison\ninmates, regular displays of owed and earned respect have created an\nextraordinarily engaged workforce responsible for impressive profitability and\ngrowth. And recidivism among Televerde\u2019s inmate employees is 80% lower than\nthe national rate.\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2018/07/do-your-employees-feel-respected?language=es)\n\nWhen you ask workers what matters most to them, feeling respected by superiors\noften tops the list. In a recent survey by Georgetown University\u2019s Christine\nPorath of nearly 20,000 employees worldwide, respondents ranked respect as the\nmost important leadership behavior. Yet [employees report](/2014/11/half-of-\nemployees-dont-feel-respected-by-their-bosses) more disrespectful and uncivil\nbehavior each year.\n\nWhat accounts for the disconnect? Although employees who aren\u2019t shown respect\nare acutely aware of its absence, people who feel respected on a regular\nbasis\u2014typically, those in managerial or other high-status roles\u2014don\u2019t think\nabout it very much. So leaders may simply be unaware of the problem. But\nresearch I\u2019ve conducted shows that this is only part of the explanation. A\nbigger issue is that leaders have an incomplete understanding of what\nconstitutes workplace respect\u2014so even well-meaning efforts to provide a\nrespectful workplace may fall short.\n\nMy research indicates that employees value two distinct types of respect.\n_Owed respect_ is accorded equally to all members of a work group or an\norganization; it meets the universal need to feel included. It\u2019s signaled by\ncivility and an atmosphere suggesting that every member of the group is\ninherently valuable. In environments with too little owed respect, we\ntypically see Tayloristic overmonitoring and micromanagement, incivility and\nabuse of power, and a sense that employees are interchangeable. _Earned\nrespect_ recognizes individual employees who display valued qualities or\nbehaviors. It distinguishes employees who have exceeded expectations and,\nparticularly in knowledge work settings, affirms that each employee has unique\nstrengths and talents. Earned respect meets the need to be valued for doing\ngood work. Stealing credit for others\u2019 success and failing to recognize\nemployees\u2019 achievements are signs that it is lacking.\n\nOne of the subtler challenges in creating a respectful atmosphere is finding\nthe right balance between the two types of respect. As Arizona State\nUniversity\u2019s Blake Ashforth and I wrote in a [recent\npaper,](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0149206314557159) an\nimbalance can create frustration for workers. For example, workplaces with\nlots of owed respect but little earned respect can make individual achievement\na low priority for employees, because they perceive that everyone will be\ntreated the same regardless of performance. That could be the right mix for\nsettings in which goals need to be accomplished as a team, but it risks\nreducing motivation and accountability. By contrast, workplaces with low owed\nrespect but high earned respect can encourage excessive competition among\nemployees. That may serve a purpose in environments, such as some sales\nforces, where workers have little interdependence or reason to collaborate.\nBut it could hinder people from sharing critical knowledge about their\nsuccesses and failures, and it often promotes cutthroat, zero-sum behavior.\nWhen they understand these nuances, leaders can craft an environment that is\nright for their situation\u2014in most cases, one with high levels of both kinds of\nrespect.\n\nEmployees who feel respected are more grateful for\u2014and loyal to\u2014their firms.\n\nBecause people\u2019s jobs are often central to who they are and how they perceive\nthemselves, respectful cues in a professional setting are important signals of\nsocial worth. What\u2019s more, employees often join organizations in the hope of\n_developing_ their identities over time, by growing professionally and\nbecoming better versions of themselves. Respect is an important feedback\nmechanism and catalyst for this growth.\n[Research](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2667055) by London\nBusiness School\u2019s Herminia Ibarra describes how new employees experiment with\nnovel and often uncomfortable behaviors, gradually incorporating them into\ntheir \u201creal selves.\u201d [My\nresearch](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0001839216678842) with\nBlake Ashforth and Arizona State University\u2019s Kevin Corley highlights this\nexperimentation and finds that feeling respected at work validates those trial\nbehaviors, helping employees go from thinking \u201cthis feels odd\u201d to believing\n\u201cmaybe this is really me\u201d and cementing their personal growth.\n\nA respectful workplace brings enormous benefits to organizations. Employees\nwho say they feel respected are more satisfied with their jobs and more\ngrateful for\u2014and loyal to\u2014their companies. They are more resilient, cooperate\nmore with others, perform better and more creatively, and are more likely to\ntake direction from their leaders. Conversely, a lack of respect can inflict\nreal damage. To quote from the best-selling book Crucial Conversations,\n\u201cRespect is like air. As long as it\u2019s present, nobody thinks about it. But if\nyou take it away, it\u2019s all that people can think about.\u201d [Research\nsupports](/2013/01/the-price-of-incivility) this assertion, finding that 80%\nof employees treated uncivilly spend significant work time ruminating on the\nbad behavior, and 48% deliberately reduce their effort. In addition,\ndisrespectful treatment often spreads among coworkers and is taken out on\ncustomers.\n\nI spent 15 months studying a unique work program for female inmates of a state\nprison. Nowhere are the differences between a disrespectful environment and a\nrespectful one clearer than in a setting where people shift back and forth\neach day between being inmates and being employees. Although outfitted in the\nsame orange clothing for both roles, the women interact with others in vastly\ndifferent ways.\n\n## How Televerde Built a Culture of Respect\n\nTeleverde is a technology-focused business-to-business marketing firm staffed\nlargely by inmates. Shortly after its founding, in 1995, Jim Hooker acquired\nthe operation\u2014consisting of seven women in a single-wide trailer on the\nproperty of an Arizona women\u2019s prison\u2014and took over as CEO. At the time,\nTeleverde had one computer and no paying customers. Hooker recognized the\npotential to pair a need in the expanding tech market with the opportunity to\nprovide valuable jobs for incarcerated women. The work entails calling\nbusinesses on behalf of Televerde\u2019s clients with the goal of making\nappointments with the client\u2019s sales team. In recent years the inmate\nemployees have helped fuel an extraordinary run of profitability, and the\ncompany experienced a compound annual growth rate of 8.5% over the past\ndecade. It now employs 650 people\u2014425 of whom are inmates\u2014and has nine call\ncenters in the United States, Scotland, Argentina, and Australia. Perhaps most\nimpressive, recidivism among its inmate employees is 80% lower than the\nnational rate. Hooker\u2019s strategic genius was to recognize a need in the\nmarketplace, but I believe it\u2019s his emphasis on owed and earned respect that\nhas enabled Televerde\u2019s success.\n\n### Owed respect.\n\nI conducted 92 interviews and spent 185 hours observing operations in three of\nTeleverde\u2019s call centers. Although I interviewed members at all levels of the\norganization, I focused on new employees, reasoning that respect dynamics\nwould be most salient when the experiences were novel. Women arrive for their\nfirst day of work with their identities stripped and their self-worth\ndiminished by months or years of prison life. While society in general\ndevalues incarcerated women, stereotyping them as dangerous, evil, and bad\nmothers, Televerde communicates that they are valued and deserve the chance to\nbe successful members of the business world.\n\nAlthough all inmates are required to work, jobs vary in pay and prestige.\nTeleverde pays up to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour\u2014significantly\nmore than the pay for most prison jobs, such as kitchen work, cleaning, and\nlandscaping. The orientation sessions I observed began with a discussion of\nthe company\u2019s history and successes, including major accomplishments and\nawards described as resulting from the tremendous work of the women in the\ncall centers. The newcomers were welcomed as \u201cTeleverdians\u201d and told, \u201cAs soon\nas you come through that door, you are a coworker, not an inmate.\u201d\n\nEmployees are addressed in the most personal way permitted by prison\nregulations\u2014\u201cMs. X,\u201d never \u201cinmate\u201d or as a number. Trainers and company\nleaders work at understanding their perspectives. I saw them explain\ncomplicated business concepts using scenarios that the women were likely to\nhave encountered previously: For instance, they elucidated organizational\ncharts using familiar restaurants as examples and discussed supply chain\nmanagement in the context of dealing drugs.\n\nCompany leaders also communicate that newcomers are a high-priority\ninvestment. They describe the many opportunities for professional development,\nsuch as participation in specialized training sessions, professional book\nclubs, and a six-month series of workshops in the year prior to release, aimed\nat preparing women mentally, emotionally, and professionally for the\ntransition. They tell workers that after release they may have the opportunity\nto work at the corporate office\u2014and about 25% have done so. The women can also\napply for Televerde scholarships toward higher education. As a final project\nfor the two-week classroom training I sat in on, each new employee presented a\nbusiness plan, building a hypothetical company around an idea or a passion.\nTeleverde managers, directors, and executives attended the presentations.\n\nLeaders are also intentional about how they present employees to outsiders.\nWhen existing or potential clients visit the call centers, managers speak\nabout the professionalism, passion, and competence of the staff. Recalling her\nexperience joining Jim Hooker in a meeting with a client group, one employee\nsaid, \u201cHe sat there just like a proud father\u2026.He did not interrupt. He didn\u2019t\ncorrect. It was very respectful, and he totally trusted us to carry out an\nintelligent conversation with the clients.\u201d\n\nOwed respect permeates the culture. Other inmate employees communicate their\nsupport for and availability to all newcomers\u2014for example, by offering to help\nthem understand training materials after work hours or by sharing stories of\nhow steep the learning curve was for them. In one call center, experienced\nemployees organized a social afternoon with the newcomers. Members of the two\ngroups learned about one another, shared tips for navigating life in the call\ncenter, and discussed their evolving career aspirations.\n\nThis owed respect is strengthened by artifacts in the workplace that remind\nemployees of their value\u2014for example, a signed poster from a client company\u2019s\ncelebrity CEO thanking employees for their outstanding work. The workspace is\ndesigned to minimize differences in status: Newcomers, experienced employees,\nand managers sit in identical cubicles near others working on the same\nproject, and it\u2019s understood that questions from newcomers are not a\ndisruption.\n\nThese practices establish and reinforce an authentic, consistent foundation of\nowed respect for all staff members. Here\u2019s how one employee described it: \u201cAt\nTeleverde you are treated like an adult. You are going to be acknowledged as a\nhuman being, someone of value, someone who has worth.\u201d Over time it became\napparent to me that the consistent experience of owed respect is a driver not\njust of employee well-being but also of the company\u2019s high performance.\n\n### Earned respect.\n\nEstablishing and upholding a high level of earned respect for the inmate\nemployees requires managerial creativity, because prison restrictions\nstipulate that they may not be given raises, bonuses, or promotions. Instead,\nfrom day one of the hiring process they must clear specific hurdles, such as\npassing a typing test and successfully completing a phone interview. Such\nmilestones continue throughout the training. In the sessions I observed, they\ntook the form of exams, a business plan presentation, and sales calls with\nmentors, with each small victory providing an opportunity for employees and\nmanagers to formally recognize the newcomers\u2019 achievements.\n\nNewcomers also participate in frequent one-on-one feedback sessions with a\ncorporate or an inmate employee trainer. Trainers at both levels emphasized to\nme the importance of being honest in these sessions and never giving\nundeserved praise. Consistent feedback continues after training is complete,\nthrough a quality control process in which accomplishments are recognized and\ndevelopmental feedback is provided. Managers relay positive feedback from\nclients and prospects, giving employees reinforcements of respect from beyond\nthe prison walls.\n\nWorkers progressively saw themselves less as inmates and more as\nprofessionals.\n\nTeleverde also publicizes employee achievements internally. Whenever an\nemployee secures a sales lead, she rings a bell\u2014the signal for peers and\nmanagers to applaud. (The first time an employee rings the bell, I was told,\nshe gets a standing ovation.) Managers and trainers award certificates\ncelebrating outstanding performance\u2014for example, when a worker reaches a\nthreshold amount of revenue generated. The women proudly display these\ncertificates in their cubicles.\n\nIn addition, managers make individual performance transparent to other\nemployees. In some cases, performance goals and each employee\u2019s progress\ntoward them are written on a whiteboard visible to the whole team. This\ntransparency lets employees connect expressions of earned respect, whether\ndirected toward themselves or toward peers, to specific achievements. It also\nencourages employees to measure their performance against an objective\nstandard instead of through comparisons to other employees, which in this\ncontext would be likely to promote competition and undermine cohesion and\ncivility.\n\nEmployees view these ongoing expressions of earned respect as crucial to their\nperformance. \u201cIt\u2019s because of that respect\u2026that we gain confidence,\u201d one told\nme. \u201cAnd the more confident you become inside, the more confident you sound on\nthe phone\u2026.So of course that brings more success and then more confidence, and\nit feeds on itself in a positive snowball effect.\u201d\n\n### Identity development.\n\nOne of the most significant takeaways from my Televerde study is the\nimportance of respect to employees\u2019 sense of self. The workers I observed\nprogressively saw themselves less as inmates and more as professionals. On\ntheir first day, a company leader told them that regardless of past choices,\nthey had an opportunity to make better ones. Hearing that \u201cwearing orange is\nnot who you are\u201d challenges newcomers to distance themselves from past\ndecisions and prison life, while the foundation of owed respect makes it clear\nthat they are viewed as having intrinsic worth. This establishes a safe\nenvironment in which they can experiment with their identities.\n\nThe women told me that the inmate experience reduces them to the least common\ndenominator. \u201cYou\u2019re made to feel very small; you\u2019re made to feel like a\nnumber,\u201d one said. Their experience at Televerde stands in stark contrast. The\ncompany doesn\u2019t tell them to leave their old selves behind and try to fit some\nprototype for a successful employee; instead it encourages them to identify\nand build on their unique attributes and strengths. One of the first training\nexercises I observed helped employees determine their own dominant personality\ntraits and see how those related to their work; the trainer explained how each\ntrait could contribute to success. These early expressions of earned respect\nfor diverse traits help employees envision who they might become at Televerde\nand as professionals more generally.\n\nTeleverde invites experienced employees to speak at training sessions. I saw\nemployees from the corporate office stop by to share their journeys, noting\nthat they had started in the same seats the newcomers now occupied. I observed\nhow these concrete examples of success and growth shifted newcomers\u2019 focus\nfrom their past selves to who they might become. In this environment,\nnewcomers feel safe testing behaviors that might be taboo in a prison setting,\nand positive reinforcement from managers, coworkers, and clients gives them\nthe confidence to grow and change. One employee said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard this from so\nmany women, and I feel the same way: When you come to work here every day,\nyou\u2019re not in prison. You\u2019re not wearing orange\u2026.I\u2019m an educated, intelligent\nprofessional who has intelligent, educated conversations with vice presidents,\nCIOs, and directors of Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 companies on a daily\nbasis. _That\u2019s_ who I am.\u201d\n\nJust as incivility can spiral throughout an organization, so too can respect.\n\nTeleverde may operate in an unusual context, but its employees\u2019 need for\nrespect is universal. The impulse to improve is at least as strong as our\nbasic physical needs, and for most of us it\u2019s a key driver when choosing an\nemployer and engaging in a job. Few workers will experience the transformation\nfrom inmate to professional, but every worker has room to grow in subtler\nways, and that growth is important to both job satisfaction and performance.\nEmployees are more likely to feel committed to an employer that enables them\nto flourish and progress.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, many situations in traditional companies evoke feelings not\nunlike an inmate\u2019s uncertainty about her worth and her intensified need for\nrespect. Consider someone working in a low-status occupation or for a company\nundergoing a change in leadership that raises questions about whether\nemployees will continue to be valued. The need for both owed and earned\nrespect\u2014and the validation they confer\u2014are key factors shaping workers\u2019\nattitudes and behaviors across a variety of employment situations.\n\n## Closing the Gap\n\nIn all but the most toxic workplaces, building a respectful organization does\nnot demand an overhaul of HR policies or any other formal changes. Rather,\nwhat\u2019s needed is ongoing consideration of the subtle but important ways in\nwhich owed and earned respect can be conveyed. Here are seven small ones\nleaders and managers can use to make an outsize impact on workers.\n\n### 1\\. Establish a baseline of owed respect.\n\nEvery employee should feel that his or her dignity is recognized and\nrespected. This is especially important for lower-level workers. [In a\nstudy](http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/janedut/High%20Quality%20Connections/Being%20valued%20%20final.pdf)\nof being valued or devalued at work, conducted by Jane Dutton (of the\nUniversity of Michigan), Gelaye Debebe (George Washington University), and Amy\nWrzesniewski (Yale), many hospital cleaners described seemingly subtle cues\nthat prompted them to feel that their worth was enhanced or diminished. Some\ncleaners were never acknowledged by other staff members, making them feel\ninvisible or as though they were looking in on hospital operations from the\noutside. Others reported a boost in energy and worth from a doctor\u2019s simply\ngreeting them or holding a door. Even in prestigious companies, issues of owed\nrespect are top of mind. An Apple sales associate described his first\nimpression of the company\u2019s CEO in a 2011 blog: \u201cFor Tim Cook there are no\ndumb questions. When he answered me he spoke to me as if I were the most\nimportant person at Apple. Indeed, he addressed me as if I were Steve Jobs\nhimself. His look, his tone, the long pause\u2026that\u2019s the day I began to feel\nlike more than just a replaceable part. I was one of the tens of thousands of\nintegral parts of Apple.\u201d Take a moment to consider whether your professional\nstatus is keeping you from perceiving a gap in respect, and note that simple\nacknowledgment or praise from a leader is often enough to make an employee\nfeel valued.\n\n### 2\\. Know how to convey respect in your particular workplace.\n\nWhether we are leaders or coworkers, we can all shape an environment where\ncolleagues reinforce respectful cues and make social worth a day-to-day\nreality for one another. [Research\npoints](http://people.hbs.edu/lramarajan/ramarajanbarsadeburack.pdf) to\nspecific behaviors that convey owed respect, such as active listening and\nvaluing diverse backgrounds and ideas. [For\nleaders,](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-009-0087-z)\ndelegating important tasks, remaining open to advice, giving employees freedom\nto pursue creative ideas, taking an interest in their nonwork lives, and\npublicly backing them in critical situations are some of the many behaviors\nthat impart respect.\n\nPay attention to norms about how to convey respect; they may vary, even from\none department to another. Perhaps people in your previous workplace signaled\nowed respect by exchanging morning pleasantries with colleagues, but those in\nyour new workplace would find that a rude distraction during the critical\nstart to the workday. Or maybe in your prior environment providing both praise\nand critical feedback during practice sessions for client presentations was\nconsidered an expression of earned respect, but your current colleagues would\nsee that as offensive.\n\n### 3\\. Recognize that respect has ripple effects.\n\nLeadership behaviors are often mimicked throughout an organization, and just\nas incivility can spiral, [so too can respect.](/2018/01/make-civility-the-\nnorm-on-your-team) The cascade from the top down is also likely to shape the\nway employees treat customers, industry partners, and members of the\ncommunity. It is no coincidence that in recent years Costco was both rated\nAmerica\u2019s best large employer by Forbes and tied for \u201cAmerica\u2019s favorite\nretailer\u201d in a survey by the American Customer Satisfaction Index. On the\nother end of the spectrum, companies at the head of \u201cworst customer service\u201d\nlists often top \u201cworst places to work\u201d lists as well.\n\nTeleverde operates in an unusual context\u2014but the need for respect is\nuniversal.\n\n### 4\\. Customize the amount of earned respect you convey.\n\nBeyond ensuring a baseline of owed respect, leaders can identify and tailor\nthe mix of respect types that will best enable their employees to thrive.\nAlthough it\u2019s likely that a higher level of both owed and earned respect is\nneeded, you might have reasons to emphasize one type or the other. Perhaps\nyou\u2019ve set a goal that requires a lot of collaboration and cohesion,\nwarranting greater emphasis on owed respect. Alternatively, if your culture\nfocuses largely on individual contributions, you might emphasize earned\nrespect while ensuring that performance standards are transparent and direct\nemployees\u2019 attention to objective deliverables rather than to subjective\ncomparisons with peers. What form might such expressions of earned respect\ntake? According to a [McKinsey global\nsurvey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-\ninsights/motivating-people-getting-beyond-money) of more than 1,000\nexecutives, managers, and employees, praise from an immediate manager,\nattention from a leader, and opportunities to head a project have more impact\non motivation than do monetary incentives.\n\n### 5\\. Think of respect as infinite.\n\nDeciding when to bestow respect is not like making a judgment that requires\ndividing up a fixed pie (as when allocating time, pay raises, or attention,\nfor instance), argue [New York University\u2019s Steven Blader and Siyu\nYu.](https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/annals.2015.0150) Respect is not\nfinite; it can be given to one employee without shortchanging others. This is\ntrue of both owed and earned respect: All members of an organization are\nentitled to the former, and all employees who meet or surpass performance\nstandards deserve the latter. And an employee\u2019s place on the org chart makes\nhim or her no more or less deserving of respect. Owed respect should be\naccorded to janitor and CEO alike, and earned respect should be based on\nmeeting or exceeding standards specific to one\u2019s role.\n\n### 6\\. See respect as a time saver, not a time waster.\n\nConveying respect doesn\u2019t necessarily come at the expense of critical tasks.\nChristine Porath calls lack of time a \u201chollow excuse,\u201d pointing out that\nrespect is largely about _how_ you do what you\u2019re already doing. [Jane Dutton\nagrees,](https://www.wiley.com/en-\nus/Energize+Your+Workplace%3A+How+to+Create+and+Sustain+High+Quality+Connections+at+Work-p-9780787956226)\nsuggesting that owed respect is best embedded in our normal interactions and\ncan be as simple as communicating and listening in appreciative ways, being\npresent to others, and affirming others\u2019 value to the company. Still nervous\nabout losing time? The small additions to your day needed to convey respect\ncould _save_ you substantial amounts of time. Porath shows that neglecting\nrespect can be far more costly than attending to it: Dealing with the\naftermath of disrespectful behavior, she estimates, consumes seven weeks a\nyear for leaders and executives in Fortune 1000 firms. The time and effort\nneeded to recognize performance, greet others, or hold a door pale in\ncomparison.\n\n### 7\\. Know when efforts to convey respect can backfire.\n\nAttempts to demonstrate respect may cause more harm than good if they are\ninconsistent or haphazard. Employees are likely to perceive vague expressions\nby HR or high-level leaders that are not enacted day-to-day by managers and\npeers as manipulative or disingenuous. And if people are particularly\nrespectful in some situations but not in others\u2014for example, if a manager\noffers praise only in the presence (or absence) of senior leaders\u2014their words\nwill probably be viewed as insincere. Finally, you should guard against earned\nrespect that is not actually deserved; it won\u2019t resonate. One Televerde\nemployee put it this way: \u201cIt\u2019s not like you want constant empty\ncompliments\u2026.I\u2019m looking to give you a valuable job.\u201d Because employees see\nhonesty as one of the most valuable expressions of respect, insincere\ncompliments, however well-intentioned, are likely to be counterproductive.\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nDuring her first month at work, one Televerde employee I met said that she had\nnever held a full-time job, had no idea how to talk to CEOs, and doubted that\nthe job could be authentically \u201cher.\u201d Nine months later she told me about\nsupportive peers, accomplishments on several projects, and meaningful praise\nfrom her manager. She added, \u201cI learned something, actually, since I made that\nstatement [nine months ago]\u2026.You are what you make yourself, so [the job] is\nme if I want it to be.\u201d Finding the right people for the right jobs and\ncoordinating day-to-day operations are a manager\u2019s solemn duty. As my research\nshows, however, the responsibilities don\u2019t end there: Managers must also build\na workplace of respect that allows employees\u2014and, as a result, their\ncompanies\u2014to become the best possible versions of themselves.\n\nA version of this article appeared in the [July\u2013August 2018](/archive-\ntoc/BR1804) issue (pp.62-71) of _Harvard Business Review_.\n\n* * *\n\n[Kristie Rogers](/search?term=kristie%20rogers&search_type=search-all) is an\nassistant professor of management at Marquette University.\n\n* * *\n\n###### This article is about [EMPLOYEE RETENTION](/topic/employee-retention)\n\n__Follow this topic\n\n__Following\n\nRelated Topics:\n\n  * [Motivating people](/topic/motivating-people)\n  * [Giving feedback](/topic/giving-feedback)\n  * [Leading teams](/topic/leading-teams)\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\n#### Partner Center\n\n[Coronavirus](/insight-center/coronavirus) [Magazine](/magazine)\n[Popular](/most-popular) [Topics](/topics) [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n[Video](/video) [Store](/store) [The Big Idea](/big-ideas) [Visual\nLibrary](/visual-library) [Reading Lists](/reading-lists) [Case\nSelections](/case-selections)\n\n[![Harvard Business Review Home](/resources/css/images/hbr_logo.svg)](/)\n\n[**Subscribe**](/subscribe)\n\n###### Explore HBR\n\n  * [The Latest](/the-latest)\n  * [Most Popular](/most-popular)\n  * [All Topics](/topics)\n  * [Magazine Archive](/magazine)\n  * [The Big Idea](/big-ideas)\n  * [Reading Lists](/reading-lists)\n  * [Case Selections](/case-selections)\n  * [Video](/video)\n  * [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n  * [Webinars](/webinars)\n  * [Visual Library](/visual-library)\n  * [My Library](/my-library)\n  * [Newsletters](/email-newsletters)\n  * [HBR Ascend](https://hbrascend.org/)\n\n###### HBR Store\n\n  * [Article Reprints](/store/articles)\n  * [Books](/store/books)\n  * [Cases](/store/case-studies)\n  * [Collections](/store/collections)\n  * [Magazine Issues](/store/magazine-issues)\n  * [HBR Guide Series](/store/landing/guides)\n  * [HBR 20-Minute Managers](/store/landing/20-minute-managers)\n  * [HBR Emotional Intelligence Series](/store/landing/emotional-intelligence-series)\n  * [HBR Must Reads](/store/landing/mustreads)\n  * [Tools](/store/tools)\n\n###### About HBR\n\n  * [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n  * [Advertise with Us](/hbr-advertising-sales)\n  * [Information for Booksellers/Retailers](/booksellers-retailers)\n  * [Masthead](/about-hbr)\n  * [Global Editions](/global-editions)\n  * [Media Inquiries](/media-inquiries)\n  * [Guidelines for Authors](/guidelines-for-authors-web)\n  * [HBR Analytic Services](/hbr-analytic-services)\n\n###### HBR Subscriber Assistance\n\n  * [Subscribe](/subscribe)\n  * [Subscriber Help](/subscriber-help)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.274.3214](tel:+18002743214)  \n[harvard@cdsfulfillment.com](mailto:harvard@cdsfulfillment.com)  \n[hbr.org/subscriberservices](/subscriberservices)\n\n  * International:  \n[+44.1858.438.412](tel:+441858438412)  \n[(Asia Pacific: +61.2.9158.6127)](tel:+61291586127)  \n[hbr@subscription.co.uk](mailto:hbr@subscription.co.uk)  \n[subscription.co.uk/hbr/help](https://www.subscription.co.uk/hbr/help)\n\n###### HBR.ORG Customer Assistance\n\n  * [Help Center](/help-customer-service-home)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.988.0886](tel:+18009880886)\n\n  *   * International:  \n[617.783.7500](tel:+16177837500)\n\n  * Email:  \n[customerservice@harvardbusiness.org](mailto:customerservice@harvardbusiness.org)\n\n  * [Copyright Permissions](/permissions)\n\n###### Follow HBR\n\n  * __[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/HBR)\n  * __[Twitter](http://twitter.com/HarvardBiz)\n  * __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review?trk=biz-companies-cym)\n  * __[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harvard_business_review/?hl=en)\n  * __[Your Newsreader](http://feeds.hbr.org/harvardbusiness/)\n\n![Harvard Business Publishing](/resources/images/2018/new_logo_May11.png)\n\n  * [About Us](/corporate/about)\n  * [Careers](/corporate/careers)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n  * [Copyright Information](/corporate/copyright)\n  * [Trademark Policy](http://trademark.harvard.edu/pages/trademark-notice)\n\n  \n\nHarvard Business Publishing:\n\n  * [Higher Education](http://hbsp.harvard.edu/)\n  * [Corporate Learning](http://www.harvardbusiness.org)\n  * [Harvard Business Review](http://hbr.org/)\n  * [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Harvard Business School Publishing.

To do it well, plan for the rollout to take more time than you think\nis necessary. Equip all levels of management to explain the context, so that\nno one is caught flat-footed. Describe how the new solution alleviates an\norganizational pain point. Make sure you can discuss how the change will\naffect people on an individual level; people's first reaction is often to ask,\n\"How will this change things for me?\" Give the affected people as many options\nand as much participation as you can. And avoid the urge to say that it's hard\nfor you to deliver this news; this often feels manipulative. Instead,\ndemonstrate humility and responsibility.\n\n![aug18-08-964904640-pm-\nimages](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/aug18-08-964904640-pm-\nimages.jpg) pm images/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2018/08/how-to-tell-your-team-that-organizational-change-\nis-coming?language=es)\n\nFrom time to time, every leader has to deliver news that is hard for employees\nto hear. Even when businesses are doing well, [organizational and structural\nchange is to be expected](/2018/05/5-behaviors-of-leaders-who-embrace-change),\nand acquisitions, reorganizations, or policy changes can affect people\u2019s jobs\nin ways that create feelings of fear, anger, or sorrow. Each employee wonders,\n\u201cHow will this change affect me?\u201d or assumes, \u201cOh, this won\u2019t be good! How am\nI going to get my work done?\u201d\n\nAnnouncements like these can be daunting. And they go awry if they\u2019re\ninsufficiently planned or poorly delivered. But by attending to the following\ncrucial components, leaders can be ready to communicate the news in ways that\nwill help recipients adjust well and recover as quickly as possible.\n\n**Plan more time than you ever thought necessary** **to prepare the content,\nthe delivery, and the necessary follow-up.** Typically, you should expect to\nhold not just one initial \u201call hands\u201d meeting or videoconference, but also a\nseries of smaller team and individual conversations as follow-ups. As one of\nmy clients was going through a series of organizational changes, a valued\nmiddle manager reacted negatively in each town hall, asking inappropriately\ndetailed questions as if it was a game of \u201cgotcha,\u201d to show that the\nramifications hadn\u2019t been fully considered. Once his boss made clear that he\nwould have the opportunity for continuing formal and informal discussions, the\nmanager kept himself in check and was able to offer specific suggestions to\nimprove implementation.\n\nAlso, take pains to coordinate announcements so that no one is caught flat-\nfooted if the news is being released at different intervals by individual\nmanagers and organization-wide outlets. It may feel like you\u2019re overinvesting\nin planning, but it will save you time and pain in the long run. Giving people\nmultiple opportunities to take in and process the announcement is essential\nfor thorough understanding; receiving the information from the right sources\nin the right sequence is crucial for credibility.\n\n**Equip all levels of management to explain the context.** Provide training\nand rehearsal or role-play time to everyone who will need to communicate the\nmessage; don\u2019t assume they\u2019ll have the right instincts. Otherwise, to escape\ntheir own discomfort, they may dump the news or blame management, either\ndirectly or indirectly.\n\n#### You and Your Team Series\n\n### Becoming a Manager\n\n  * ![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/08/further-reading-manager-et.jpg)\n\n######  [New Managers Should Focus on Helping Their Teams, Not Pleasing Their\nBosses](/2017/07/new-managers-should-focus-on-helping-their-teams-not-\npleasing-their-bosses)\n\n    * Karen Dillon\n\n######  [How New Managers Can Send the Right Leadership Signals](/2017/08/how-\nnew-managers-can-send-the-right-leadership-signals)\n\n    * Amy Jen Su\n\n######  [High-Performing Teams Need Psychological Safety. Here\u2019s How to Create\nIt](/2017/08/high-performing-teams-need-psychological-safety-heres-how-to-\ncreate-it)\n\n    * Laura Delizonna\n\nOne client\u2019s executive team had to do significant repair when frontline\nmanagers announced to their teams that there would be a cutback in bonuses\nbecause \u201cthey said you didn\u2019t do enough,\u201d rather than explaining the reasons\nfor the results and the plans already under way to improve those results for\nthe future. Employees who had worked as hard as they could were frustrated and\nresentful, and were untrusting of senior management for some time thereafter.\n\n**Describe the organizational pain, and how the new solution alleviates it.**\nInstead of just announcing a disruptive change, give the background of what\u2019s\nnot working today and [why the new plan is the best way](/2018/01/sgc-\nresearch-when-moving-to-an-open-office-plan-pay-attention-to-how-your-\nemployees-feel) to get to the desired outcome. Focus on how customers have\nbeen hurt, how the business is incurring extra expense, the negative brand\nimpact \u2014 and how the change will help mitigate those problems. When one client\nhad to consolidate multiple operations to increase efficiency and reduce time\nto market, it was clear that there wouldn\u2019t be room for all the incumbent\nleaders. It helped to review the shared history and the acknowledged pain\npoints.\n\n**Personalize both the impact and the resolution.**  If you don\u2019t, [employees\nmay not understand](/2017/05/overcome-resistance-to-change-with-two-\nconversations) which specifics apply to them, or even how the company is\nproviding support or services to help them cope. For example, in the small\ngroup or individual meetings, come prepared with all the necessary details to\nbe able to answer personal questions immediately, rather than creating even\nmore anxiety and aggravation while you assign someone to work out the\nspecifics you didn\u2019t research in advance. When one client changed its health\nplans to keep costs down, it helped covered employees research their doctors\u2019\neligibility and find new practitioners when necessary. The employees were\ngrateful for the individual attention and support, and were subsequently less\nresentful even though items such as deductibles and co-pays had gotten more\nexpensive.\n\n**Give the affected people as many options and as much participation as you\ncan.** When they have choices \u2014 and the necessary information or support to\nmake them \u2014 employees feel more respected and maintain more pride and\nautonomy. The closer people are to the work, the more likely it is that\nthey\u2019ll generate practical ideas. At one organization that was having some\nfinancial difficulties, we facilitated a series of meetings about cost-cutting\nmeasures that let everyone look for ways to help out \u2014 even though they were\nadversely affected by some of the very measures they proposed.\n\nAnd don\u2019t assume you know what\u2019s best for each individual or what they might\nchoose. When a client company was absorbed into a larger operating unit, some\ndeeply committed HR executives stayed till the bitter end, providing\noutplacement for their colleagues despite knowing that by the time they looked\nfor jobs themselves, the best opportunities would already have been filled.\n\n**Demonstrate humility and responsibility, not just authority.** Many leaders\nmistakenly believe that they\u2019ll be given a pass for shaking up people\u2019s lives\n[if they say they\u2019re suffering](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-spill-\nbp-apology/bp-ceo-apologizes-for-thoughtless-oil-spill-comment-\nidUSTRE6515NQ20100602) over the decision or the disruption themselves. Even\ntreating the problem as a shared responsibility can backfire and feel\nmanipulative to employees. Instead, say things like, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t\nanticipate\u2026\u201d or, \u201cI was too enthusiastic about x\u2026\u201d to show that you take\nseriously the impact of the situation on others. You can\u2019t prepare for every\ncurveball, so if you don\u2019t have the answer to a question, say something like,\n\u201cWow, that\u2019s a question we didn\u2019t think about, but it\u2019s a good one. We\u2019ll get\nback to everyone with an answer early next week.\u201d Don\u2019t try to fake your way\nthrough.\n\nYou can use this kind of planned approach to get the most mileage out of your\norganization\u2019s good news, recognizing that everyone won\u2019t necessarily perceive\nthe good news as being good for them personally. It can feel unnecessarily\npainstaking to take the time to plan and then work through all the details\nwith your employees. But knowing you\u2019ve done everything you could to help them\nwithstand challenges and move ahead will make it much more satisfying when you\nfinally achieve the desired results.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/05/HeadshotKislik_1221.jpg)\n\n[Liz Kislik](/search?term=liz%20kislik&search_type=search-all) helps\norganizations from the Fortune 500 to national nonprofits and family-run\nbusinesses solve their thorniest problems.

It's the adoption of tech to address the whole system and\nprocess approach that counts.\n\nI is critical as it stands for integration - we cannot transform without\ngetting the whole company transformed. Technology alone won't work. We need\nthe alignment of tech, talent and trust, believing that change is needed to\nbuild a more sustainable company, industry and ecosystem.\n\nG is for growth which cannot happen if individuals and companies do not\ncollaborate to innovate. The worst of times is the best of times to dig in -\nmarry your domain expertise with other tech partners or startups and develop\nyour people with real projects to be implemented. Almost like a live lab -\nexperiment and learn. Time to DIG in together.\n\n* * *\n\n**Victor Mills  \nChief Executive  \nSingapore International Chamber of Commerce **\n\nEvery Singapore government annual budget is designed to sustain Singapore's\nsuccess. Among the critical, long-term issues are Singapore's further plans to\nmitigate the effects of climate change and the incentivisation of businesses\nand consumers to be less wasteful. Behaviour must change, and the best way is\nby financial carrots and sticks. Businesses should be rewarded for using less\nof the earth's resources and recycling more of what they use. Consumers should\nbe rewarded for using less plastic and recycling with care. Another longterm\nissue is how our society will end ageism in the workforce to maximise citizen\npotential.\n\n* * *\n\n**Cheung Pui Yuen  \nChief Executive Officer  \nDeloitte Singapore **\n\nWhile it is crucial that this year's Budget address the immediate concerns of\nSingaporeans during this time of increasing volatility, the long-term planning\nto prepare our economy for the future should not be derailed. Businesses need\nsupport, not only to tide through potentially trying times as they adapt to\nglobal changes, but also in their quest to succeed, expand and innovate in\nline with Singapore's ongoing economic transformation.\n\nPolicy support to develop and deepen workers' capabilities should continue to\nremain high priority to assure the workforce of their jobs, and to make\navailable quality human capital for businesses. Tackling climate change and\nencouraging sustainability efforts are other areas that require attention.\n\nCitizen welfare in terms of health care and social support is also\nfundamental, given Singapore's ageing population. The changes in recent years\nwarrant measures that better reflect our economic, environmental and social\nneeds.\n\n* * *\n\n**Jayajyoti Sengupta  \nHead of Asia-Pacific, Japan, India and Middle East  \nCognizant **\n\nUnlike past technology shifts, today's digital era is about the coming\ntogether of multiple technologies such as automation, artificial intelligence,\nmachine learning and augmented reality. We are therefore less likely to see\nlong periods of stability.\n\nThis has made it imperative for all key stakeholders such as the government,\nindustry and academia to continually collaborate in conceiving and driving new\nskilling approaches to facilitate greater innovation and build deeper, more\ndiverse cross-functional competencies that the digital era mandates.\n\nThe 2020 Budget should focus on creating the necessary frameworks and\nplatforms for Singapore to expand this collaboration, enabling society,\nbusiness and governance to better embrace and benefit from the transformative\npotential of digital technologies.\n\n* * *\n\n**John Lombard  \nAsia Pacific CEO  \nNTT Ltd **\n\nToday's digital economy has created large-scale demand for automation,\nartificial intelligence and analytics skills, as we increasingly deploy these\ndigital technologies to improve the way we work, live and play.\n\nThis year, concerns over the global economic slowdown are driving businesses\nto focus on increasing productivity and efficiency through the use of smart\ntechnologies as a key business priority. Budget 2020 can play a pivotal role\nin enabling their digital transformation journey. It should offer fiscally\nsustainable measures and incentives that can help businesses stay relevant and\ncompetitive to encourage innovation and digitalisation as Singapore pushes\nahead to achieve its vision of becoming a leading AI hub.\n\n* * *\n\n**Max Loh  \nEY Managing Partner, Brunei and Singapore  \nErnst & Young LLP **\n\nBudget 2020 must invariably strike a balance between addressing the urgent -\nand the important. The novel coronavirus outbreak exacerbates business\nuncertainties and pressures caused by existing geopolitical and trade tensions\nand macroeconomic concerns. Short-term reliefs will be important to help\nbusinesses and people cope with the impact.\n\nYet, the Budget should press on with the economic transformation agenda that\nhas been set in motion at the industry and workforce levels as a longer-term\nimperative. Continuing to elevate enterprise and workforce capabilities and\naddressing the gaps between current skills and future opportunities in the\nworkforce is vital. Any periods of business slowdown during these uncertain\ntimes may optimistically be seen as availing companies and people of time,\nwhich can be reinvested into transformation, training and upskilling to ready\nthemselves for growth going forward.\n\n* * *\n\n**Yeoh Oon Jin  \nExecutive Chairman  \nPwC Singapore **\n\nWhile in the short term we must help those impacted by the coronavirus\noutbreak, we must not lose sight of the need to continue transforming our\neconomy to be fit for the long run.\n\nOur tax system must remain competitive. Tax incentives that are now less\nattractive due to global developments should be adjusted, and tax rules and\nadministration should be tweaked to provide greater transparency and certainty\nto investors. This would help Singapore differentiate itself as a hub location\nfor international business, being in the centre of a fast-growing Asian\neconomy.\n\nIt is by building for the future that Singapore will be well placed to\nwithstand external shocks from time to time.\n\n* * *\n\n**Lee Fook Chiew  \nChief Executive Officer  \nInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants **\n\nWe hope that Singapore's 2020 Budget will address the issue of educating and\ntraining students to be ready for the digital economy. The digitalisation of\neconomies is now the new normal.\n\nTo thrive in the digital economy, Singapore's workforce of tomorrow must\nintegrate technologies into their daily lives. This requires Singaporeans'\nmindsets to be changed from young. The education process should start before\nthe tertiary level. Early exposure to digital technologies, coupled with\neducation curriculum that focuses on building digital skills and fostering a\nmindset of resilience, adaptability and lifelong learning, will contribute\ntowards building a digital-ready workforce for Singapore.\n\nThis was also shared by panellists at the recent ISCA Pre-Budget Roundtable\n2020, where business and industry leaders shared insights on how Singapore's\nBudget can be shaped to advance the nation's future.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ho Nyok Yong  \nPresident  \nSingapore Green Building Council **\n\nClimate change is not going anywhere. Increasingly extreme and erratic weather\nphenomena will continue to affect billions of people all around the globe. As\na small low-lying coastal nation with an open economy, Singapore is\nparticularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\n\nClimate action on a national level must be kicked into high gear, encompassing\nproven measures such as green building to effect affirmative climate action.\nWe hope that a holistic, fiscally feasible and long-term climate action plan\ncan be put forward by the government in this year's Budget, alongside its\npriorities in social spending and business restructuring. This will provide\nindustry stakeholders with a clearer direction and greater impetus to take\nconcrete climate action for a more sustainable and liveable Singapore.\n\n* * *\n\n**Dileep Nair  \nIndependent Director  \nThakral Corporation Limited **\n\nOne secret of Singapore's success is to keep preparing for the future. This is\nunderwritten by the Budget - our long-term financial plan. Investment in\ninfrastructure is critical, including renewal of public housing especially as\nthe older estates age; extension of the road and rail network to keep\ntransport efficient; upgrading of the port and airport for maintaining our\ntop-class links with the world; and expanding our healthcare facilities,\nparticularly to cater for our ageing population.\n\nWe must continue to invest in economic restructuring to produce new economic\nengines that will propel growth in the future. Likewise, there must be\ninvestment in education so that our tertiary institutions both equip their\nstudents with the knowledge and skills that the new economy demands, as well\nas provide lifelong learning for adult workers. Only by addressing such\nlonger-term issues will we realise SG100.\n\n* * *\n\n**Tony Lombardo  \nChief Executive Officer, Asia  \nChairman, Lendlease Global Commercial Trust Management Pte Ltd **\n\nThe Budget should not lose sight of the Industry 4.0 revolution to continue to\nfuture-proof the economy. Our position as the regional hub for innovation\npresents the opportunity for us to continue to be a driving force for the\nIndustrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The Budget must support the country's\ntransformation into a data-driven powerhouse. Industry 4.0 increases the\nproductivity and competitiveness of our various sectors and will create the\njobs of the future. Looking ahead to the next year and decade, the right focus\non R&D and training investment would be key.\n\n* * *\n\n**Thomas Holenia  \nPresident  \nHenkel Singapore **\n\nRecent events have reinforced the VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity\nand ambiguity) environment we live in today. With people talent as Singapore's\ncritical asset and competitive advantage, it is imperative that incentives and\nmeasures for upskilling our workforce extend across technical competences,\nleadership abilities and instilling an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nIn this aspect, Henkel Singapore actively supports our employees in continuous\nlearning and leadership skills development while promoting a diverse and\ninclusive work culture. Sustainability is another key topic where we welcome a\ngreater push for industry collaboration.\n\nFor example, we see benefits from our strong engagement in the Together for\nSustainability initiative, where collectively with other leading companies, we\nare making progress on the sustainability agenda along the entire value chain\nof the chemical industry, globally and in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n* * *\n\n**Jayaprakash Jagateesan  \nChief Executive Officer  \nRHT Fintech Holdings **\n\nThe digital economy is set to play a larger role in Singapore's growth over\nthe long term. Financial technology and new solutions powered by blockchain\nwill become more prevalent and open new possibilities, transforming the way we\ndo business. Education and employment are two key areas that demand additional\nattention in the upcoming Budget to build a pipeline of future-ready local\ntalent.\n\nThe digital economy has no geographic limitations; it can thrive anywhere with\naccess to talent and connectivity. With the right steps in education and\nemployment, Singapore can become a leading global hub for fintech.\n\n* * *\n\n**Marjet Andriesse  \nManaging Director, Asia Pacific  \nTelstra **\n\nMuch has been done in recent years to encourage digital transformation,\ncreating a wave of digitally-mature businesses in Singapore. With the digital\neconomy of South-east Asia expected to triple by 2025, there is a clear growth\nopportunity for businesses that can engage in digital trade and take advantage\nof increased cross-border data flows.\n\nThere is value in investing in facilitating digital trade between Singapore\nand other countries. This includes practical improvements like the removal of\nbarriers to cross-border payments and the creation of common standards for\nartificial intelligence. This will ultimately lower costs for businesses, as\nwell as increase their overall efficiency over time. These digital rules and\nstandards will help create trust and confidence for businesses and facilitate\nthe growth of Singapore's digital economy.\n\n* * *\n\n**Peh Kim Choo  \nChief Executive Officer  \nTsao Foundation **\n\nIn just 10 years' time, a quarter of Singapore's population will be aged 65\nyears and above. To prepare for this, the healthcare system is being\ntransformed and continuous learning and volunteering encouraged among older\npersons. Yet ageism remains prevalent, causing many cultural, social-economic\nand structural barriers that prevented older people and society to reap the\ndividends of longevity.\n\nBudget 2020 can work with all levels of societies to bring about a mindset\nchange - to do a re-vision on the capacity and role of older people by current\nevidence, not prejudice, and to make removing ageism a part of the practice\nand mainstream policy.\n\n* * *\n\n**Peter Seow  \nCEO  \niPlus Living **\n\nDespite the government reaffirming plans to spend S$2.4 billion to drive the\ncountry's smart nation efforts and digital transformations, I believe more can\nbe done in this aspect. 2020 will witness an increase in the automation of\ndaily life, through machine learning, smart technologies, 5G\ntelecommunications and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nI would like to see in the upcoming Budget more long-term initiatives in place\nto enable traditional businesses to adapt to the new digital economy. Smart\nproducts and services must be made available for all homes and businesses to\nhelp with future-proofing our society. Paying attention to and prioritising\nthe needs of Singaporeans will also play a significant role in driving our\nnation's overall transformation success.\n\n* * *\n\n**Hari V Krishnan  \nCEO  \nPropertyGuru Group **\n\nIn Singapore's 2020 Budget, I hope to see a greater commitment to\nsustainability and urban development. Singapore has the opportunity to take a\nleadership position on urban living in Asia by evolving our current policies\nto better encourage and reward developers that champion sustainable practices\nacross all elements of their projects. These initiatives and grants should\nalso benefit those purchasing, and investing in green developments.\n\nIncentivising sustainable practices, not only at a large organisational level\nbut also a local community level, needs to be more aggressively addressed. For\nexample, how can we reward the community for being sustainability advocates\nand taking simple actions like eliminating the use of single-use plastics.\n\nI also hope to see ongoing commitment and investment towards technology that\nwill foster widespread sustainable practices (ie urban development processes,\nsustainable water usage, recycling infrastructure, etc), which in turn results\nin significant action against climate change.\n\n* * *\n\n**Turochas 'T' Fuad  \nMD, Southeast Asia and Korea  \nWeWork **\n\nToday's business climate is no longer influenced by just economic factors.\nUnpredictable and diverse factors have led to increased vulnerability for\nSingapore's economy. This has highlighted the importance and urgency for\ncompanies to be empowered with agility and flexibility to address the\nchallenges.\n\nAs South-east Asia continues to be in a positive growth trajectory,\nSingapore's position in advancing this growth will become critical. For this\nyear's Budget, I would like to see a greater emphasis given to supporting\ncompanies and their future-proofing strategies. From talent to infrastructure\nand operations, companies need to have the right support to drive efficiency\nduring challenging times and scale readily when opportunities arise.\n\n* * *\n\n**Sandie Overtveld  \nVP APAC  \nZendesk **\n\nHistorically, Singapore has consistently and successfully adjusted its sails\nto maximise global tailwinds or when faced with economic headwinds. As our\ngeopolitical climate shifts, there are a number of long (and near) term issues\nit should focus on in order to maintain its position as one of the world's\nmost competitive economies, according to the World Economic Forum.\n\nThese include: continuing to build its reputation globally for being pro-\nbusiness; accelerating its evolution towards being a leading digital economy\nwith an emphasis on advancing its artificial intelligence capabilities;\nchampioning cultural diversity and inclusion; boosting investment into talent\ndevelopment across its entire workforce; and continuing to pledge its support\nfor policies that seek to mitigate the effects of climate change. Ultimately,\nI believe Singapore will be able to weather any uncertainties as long as we\ncontinue to work together to build on its success.\n\n* * *\n\n**Martin Lim  \nCEO  \nElectrify Pte Ltd **\n\nThe present levels of greenhouse emissions are no longer tenable, having led\nto extreme weather events that threaten survival and business continuity. I\nhope that the Budget can place an emphasis on greener business practices,\nestablishing the necessary foundation for long-term sustainable growth.\n\nOne viable strategy is to encourage the adoption of renewable energy among our\nenterprises, leveraging technologies such as peer-to-peer energy trading. This\ncreates an avenue for private energy producers to provide additional renewable\nenergy options for consumers while allowing them to monetise on this surplus\nenergy, potentially accelerating solar panel ownership and renewable energy\nuptake in Singapore.\n\n* * *\n\n**David Kirubi  \nCountry GM, Singapore & GM, Transformation, Asia-Pacific  \nJohnson Controls **\n\nThere is clear urgency to address the impact of systemic and material changes\ncaused by climate change and global health-related concerns. The private\nsector cannot afford to ignore critical parameters beyond the financials.\nSingapore's Budget 2020 should look to better shepherding corporates to adopt\nthe triple bottom line, which includes social and environmental\nconsiderations.\n\nWe see real opportunities with the strides we are making in technology. For\nthe built environment, we now have unprecedented visibility into the total\noperational costs over a facility's entire life cycle. We can identify gaps in\nhuman and equipment productivity, physical and cyber security, as well as\nasset utilisation; hence significantly optimising resources and improving\nhuman experience while achieving business goals. The adoption of such\ntechnology can be accelerated with more bespoke policy by the government and\nprogrammes by the public sector.\n\n* * *\n\n**Tomas O'Farrell  \nCo-Founder  \nWorkana **\n\nWith the global economic climate becoming challenging, a Budget that addresses\nre-skilling and providing opportunities for the digital economy workers of\nSingapore's future would be progressive and strategic. As the status quo\nchanges and Singaporeans need the digital skills, programmes, that prepare\nthem for the shared economy would be critical for the on-going development of\nthe country.\n\nKey to this is the collaboration between the government, private sector and\npublic to understand and embrace new ways of working including flexible and\nfreelance working careers. Only by re-thinking how we work, can Singaporeans\nand businesses increase productivity and remain competitive in a rapidly\nchanging environment.\n\n* * *\n\n**Yu Tat Ming  \nChief Executive Officer  \nPacificLight Power **\n\nWhile it is important to provide temporary relief to mitigate economic\nslowdown brought about by the novel coronavirus to the affected sectors,\nsustainability remains of strategic importance in the long term. The Singapore\n2020 Budget should be geared towards preparing the nation for the future, with\ninitiatives such as schemes that support the adoption of best efficiency\npractices and improvements across different industries.\n\nFor example, grants incentivising businesses to adopt sustainable practices\nwill bring about significant reductions in carbon emissions and at the same\ntime create economic spinoffs in the form of new technologies. The overall\ncost savings and improvement in productivity will strengthen Singapore's\neconomy and make it more robust.\n\n* * *\n\n**Veronica Shim  \nFounder and CEO  \nEnvysion Wealth Management **\n\nOver the years, the Budget focused primarily on restructuring the economy by\nencouraging automation, risk-taking, innovation, developing test-beds for\nstartups, business transformation and support for lower income groups. This\nyear, the Singapore government should pay close attention to the underlying\nforces that will affect Singapore in the medium and long term. These include\nfactors such as climate change and rising sea levels, the pathway at the\nArctic that will affect the strategic importance of Singapore's port and\ngateway to the other parts of the world to skills sets that Singaporeans will\nrequire to manage the benefits and issues that 5G will bring. It will also be\nimportant to address demographic changes and the structural changes around the\nworld.\n\n* * *\n\n**Mario Singh  \nChief Executive Officer  \nFullerton Markets **\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Singapore's success is its commitment to plan for the\nfuture. Against this backdrop, there are three areas which Budget 2020 should\naddress with a long-term perspective:\n\n1) Better urban planning - As the population increases, the government needs\nto look into areas such as housing, pollution, traffic congestion and\ninfrastructure. One praiseworthy initiative is that Singapore has set a target\nto have 80 per cent of its buildings with the BCA Green Mark certification by\n2030.\n\n2) Stronger global competitiveness - In October 2019, Singapore was ranked the\nworld's most competitive nation by the World Economic Forum's Global\nCompetitiveness Report. it is important that Singapore maintains this edge by\nintroducing policies that are pro-business and innovation-centric.\n\n3) Deeper Asean Integration - With a combined population of 640 million\npeople, Asean holds tremendous economic opportunities for the world. By\nintegrating deeper with our Asean neighbours in areas such as connectivity,\nfintech and sectoral cooperation, we would unlock even more potential for our\ncountry and Singaporeans as a whole.\n\n* * *\n\n**Isabel Chong  \nCountry Manager (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore) Electrical Sector  \nEaton East Asia **\n\nAmid rising energy appetites, greater support for the adoption of low-carbon,\nenergy-efficient technologies will be paramount to meeting Singapore's long-\nterm sustainability goals. Singapore's demand for power is only set to grow,\nand the Budget must go towards programmes and initiatives that encourage\nbusinesses here to invest in technologies that not only aid more efficient\npower management, but also improve power quality as well. As we move towards\nan era of smart grids guided by intelligent energy planning and consumption to\nhelp us in our transition towards renewables, companies will need to invest\nheavily into modernising and retrofitting their energy infrastructure.\n\n* * *\n\n**Alex Teo  \nMD and VP, South East Asia  \nSiemens Digital Industries Software **\n\nManufacturing accounts for a significant portion of Singapore's gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), and contributes hundreds of thousands of jobs to the local\neconomy. While the sector appears to be in recovery after a challenging year\nmarked by uncertainty, it is an important reminder that the industry needs to\nbecome more resilient against unpredictable factors such as global economic\nheadwinds and digital disruption.\n\nBesides encouraging digitalisation, professional upskilling is also crucial to\nempower talents to direct and control this technology, which will help realise\nSingapore's vision of Industry 4.0. This allows firms to be more adaptable and\nscalable, allowing them access to opportunities across a wider range of\nemerging industries such as biomedical and aerospace engineering, turning\ncrisis into opportunity.\n\n* * *\n\n**Kent Nash  \nGM, Asia Pacific & Japan  \nSolace Corporation **\n\nDespite the short-term market fluctuations, Singapore should not veer off from\nits long-term goal of building a resilient economy through continued\ncommitment towards supporting businesses' digital transformations. Businesses\nthat thrive in today's digital economy are ones that are ''always on'' -\nresponding to the events that matter, and anticipating the events, so they can\navoid problems and take full advantage of opportunities.\n\nHowever, this has been challenging as consumers have raised the bar on what\n''timely'' means and now expect real-time responsiveness. Technology is\nsupposed to help, but a lot of the legacy technology systems are not designed\nfor a real-time world. Having the resources to enhance the necessary\ntechnological infrastructure to achieve real-time responsiveness will be\nimperative for businesses to stay competitive.\n\n* * *\n\n**John Chen  \nVP, Global Forwarding, Asia  \nCH Robinson **\n\nDespite a challenging economic environment, a unified and efficient global\nsupply chain remains a major driver of competitiveness and market leadership\nfor export-reliant economies such as Singapore.\n\nThe 2020 Singapore Budget should look at continuing to reinforce our position\nas a global logistics hub. Initiatives focusing on grooming talent and\ninnovating technologies in wholesale trade and logistic sectors not only\nsupport our push towards becoming a Smart Nation, but will further reinforce\nour commitment towards helping businesses innovate and globalise. Open\ninnovation platforms such as Networked Trade Platform, launched in 2018,\nshould remain an ongoing priority development for Singapore in order to allow\nlong-term economic growth and value creation to take place.\n\n* * *\n\n**Munenori Ando  \nRegional Managing Director  \nEpson Singapore **\n\nIn the future, Singapore will continue to face environmental challenges that\nwe must be prepared for. While the government is already taking proactive\nsteps to address many of these issues, businesses need to do their part to\nhelp Singapore reduce its collective burden on the environment. Sustainable\nbusiness practices create long-term value, not just by strengthening the\nresilience of an organisation against change, but also positively contributing\nto the economy and broader society. As such, companies like Epson aim to\ncreate synergies through open innovation with partners and customers based on\ninnovative technologies, products and services, so that everyone plays a\npositive role in creating a better world.\n\n* * *\n\n**Joanne Wong  \nVice President, APJ  \nLogRhythm **\n\nIn preparing our economy for the future, Singapore has been pushing businesses\nand organisations to adopt digital technologies. Yet, a sound digital strategy\nneeds to go hand-in-hand with a strong cyber security posture, where\nidentifying and detection of network behavioural anomalies is early,\nresponding to and remediating threats is swift.\n\nHowever, achieving this requires more than beefing up on cyber security\nspending, but also investing effort and resources to build a strong technology\ntalent pool. This includes encouraging the current workforce to expand\nskillsets and getting our next generations interested in STEM (science,\ntechnology, engineering and mathematics). After all, Singapore's race to\nbecome a smart, digital nation is not a destination, but a journey.\n\n* * *\n\n**Axel Berkling  \nExecutive Vice President  \nKONE Asia Pacific **\n\nBudget 2020 has to address both short and long-term issues facing Singapore's\nbusinesses today. I hope that measures will be introduced to help incentivise\ncompanies to embrace sustainable business practices and support Singapore's\ngoal of becoming a sustainability hub. At KONE, we believe sustainability\nhelps businesses and communities to remain innovative and competitive.\n\nFrom an environmental standpoint, the Budget should introduce fiscal measures\nsuch as tax incentives and grants that will help promote investment and focus\non more green, energy-efficient buildings. Also, the government should\nencourage sustainable financing by offering tax rebates and exemptions for\ninvestors who invest in green bonds, social bonds and other sustainable\nfinancing facilities.\n\n* * *\n\n**Frankie Chia  \nManaging Partner  \nBDO LLP **\n\nA good balance between meeting immediate needs and building sustainability\nremains key to Singapore's future.\n\nWe must continue to push the boundaries and set the standards for a Smart\nNation. More incentives such as the investment allowance and enhanced\ndeduction should be given to companies which embark on digitalisation.\n\nAs companies in Singapore are climbing onto the green bandwagon, the\ngovernment may incentivise companies which actively go green - with perhaps\ntax rebates for reducing printing, using equipment with low carbon emission,\netc.\n\nIn the face of an ageing population in Singapore, the government can continue\nto raise efforts in shaping the future of health care in Singapore and\nactively promote healthy living and preventive health programmes. This\nincludes partnering with overseas academies to create opportunities for\nmeaningful collaborations where our researchers and scientists can tap on\nglobal networks to accelerate research and innovation.\n\n* * *\n\n**Abhishek Chatterjee  \nFounder and CEO  \nTookitaki Holding Pte Ltd **\n\nThe call for applications for digital banking licences heralds a new age in\nSingapore's journey to liberalise its financial sector, one that will deliver\nspeed, convenience and choice for both wholesale and retail bank consumers.\nThe rapid digitisation of the financial sector will inevitably present its own\nset of challenges.\n\nRecent events globally - such as a rise in fraud, money-laundering scandals,\nas well as cases around corporate corruption and the financing of terrorism -\npose very real threats to the financial sector. The industry sees a marked\nneed for greater efficiency around tracking illegal financial activity. Prior\nto ushering in the banking revolution, perhaps Budget 2020 could address\ninvestment into the revisiting and updating of the regulatory framework\nsurrounding financial institutions.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ivy Lai  \nCountry Manager  \nPhilips Singapore **\n\nThe healthcare industry is facing unprecedented challenges to improve\nhealthcare standards and manage rising costs due to an aging population,\nrising rates of chronic diseases and healthcare resource constraints. We need\nto invest in the use of technology to resolve these issues and challenges in\norder to improve patient outcomes across the health continuum - from healthy\nliving and prevention, to diagnosis, treatment and home care. For example,\nartificial intelligence can help people make sense of large amounts of data,\nwhile also having the potential to adapt to the needs of healthcare\nprofessionals and people, extend their abilities, and help them achieve better\nhealth outcomes.\n\n* * *\n\n**Stu Garrow  \nSVP & General Manager, APAC  \nTalend **\n\nAccording to an IDC study in the Asean region, Singapore is the third place\nwhen it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) adoption rates. Government\nannouncements on the implementation of a National AI Strategy last year and a\nnew AI Governance Framework a few weeks ago position the nation on its way to\nbecoming a leader in the AI market.\n\nThe government can further encourage this development by equipping the\ncountry's workforce and businesses with AI tools, training and grants to\nensure faster adoption of AI in this technology-driven economy. AI has the\npotential to reinvigorate the country's economy and boost its industrial\nprofits. According to a recent report by Accenture, AI could add up to US$215\nbillion in gross value across 11 industries by 2035.\n\n* * *\n\n**Vikas Nahata  \nCo-Founder and Executive Chairman  \nValidus Capital **\n\nIn the anticipation of a tough year ahead for the Singapore economy, business\nmeasures should be in place to address relevant business needs, especially\nthose of SMEs, to help them stay afloat and catapult. We hope that Budget 2020\nwill be able to better support strategies like growth financing for\ninvestments in technology that could help in technology adoption for SMEs to\nstay sustainable and grow, unlocking long-term socio-economic impact. There is\na need for increased liquidity through new schemes and greater access to\nfinancial solutions to help businesses better position themselves for the\nglobal economy's next upswing.\n\n* * *\n\n**Edward Senju  \nRegional CEO  \nSansan Global Pte Ltd **\n\nWith the changing market conditions and rapid fluctuations in the modern\neconomy, it has become incumbent upon businesses to continue to create new\nopportunities for growth - this is where a massive government push is needed.\nThe Budget must power up high-growth local firms to build new capabilities,\ninnovate and internationalise in the long run.\n\nWhile digitisation will be key to the government's business transformation\nagenda, offering help and expertise to overcome the challenges that accompany\nthis change is also a must. Moreover, automation support, if directed towards\nenhancing the productivity of businesses, will help the economy prosper in the\nlong term.\n\nPeople will always be a major driving force behind innovation and national\nprogress, therefore support measures offered must positively impact present to\nfuture generations. Empowering the workforce to upskill and engage in higher-\nvalue work will improve their future prospects.\n\n* * *\n\n**Matthieu Imbert-Bouchard  \nManaging Director  \nRobert Half Singapore: **\n\nIn order for Singapore to remain competitive on the global stage, the city-\nstate would benefit from continued support to accelerate the digitisation of\nservices and operations, which in turn is expected to drive many emerging job\nopportunities. Simultaneously, many companies currently struggle to find the\ntalent to support such initiatives. So with the skills gap hindering\ncompanies' ability to grow, plans and resources to help the Singaporean\nworkforce to upskill so they prepare it for a future of technological\ndisruption, greater competition, and economic changes is key for business\ngrowth.\n\n* * *\n\n**Dolly Goh  \nCEO  \nSingapore National Co-operative Federation (SNCF) **\n\nHealthcare expenditure, already the third highest area of Singapore's spending\nafter defence and education, should continue to be in the spotlight given the\ncountry's ageing demographics. Currently, there are subsidies on selected\nmedical services with additional benefits for Pioneer and Merdeka generations.\n\nBut in planning ahead, we need to factor in expenditures beyond basic\nhealthcare provisions. This is because not only is the number of older\nSingaporeans likely to double by 2030, recent official statistics show that\nthe proportion of elderly persons living alone is growing. With these trends,\nthe approach to healthcare needs to be holistic, covering geriatrics.\n\nSocial entities such as co-operatives can step in to address some areas of\nhealthcare needs such as long-term affordable and holistic healthcare services\nlike senior homes and eldercare centres. Together, co-operating with other\nhealthcare providers and the government, the aggregation of purchase of drugs\nand medical supplies could bring down costs for the end-users.\n\n* * *\n\n**Edmund Lee  \nManaging Director Singapore  \nTMF Group **\n\nWhile the Budget is likely to be dominated by immediate support and relief\nmeasures as a result of the novel coronavirus situation, we do believe it will\nstill contain longer term initiatives reflecting the government's policy for\nthe years to come.\n\nWe hope to see a continued focus on Singapore's Smart Nation initiative; more\nrobust measures to encourage and support firms to deepen enterprise\ncapabilities in areas such as digitisation, artificial intelligence and robot\nprocess automation (RPA), will position them well for the future economy.\n\nIn addition, with climate change's rising ubiquity, we are hoping the Budget\nwill reinforce Singapore's commitment to reduce its emissions intensity. This\ncould be through the provision of green incentives such as grants to increase\nthe adoption of electric vehicles, and public education on recycling.\n\n* * *\n\n**Laletha Nithiyanandan  \nManaging Director  \nBehavioural Consulting Group **\n\nSingapore needs to move away from focussing only on economic growth to\nadopting a more balanced Budget like New Zealand.\n\nGDP cannot be the only measure of success for any government; it needs to\nserve all of its citizens. The Budget should pave the way for purposeful\ncapitalism, innovation and needs to ensure we move beyond campaigns to action.\nGovernment and quasi-government bodies need to stop competing within the\nbusiness sector. They need to focus on core services and not be so caught up\nin making money. This will enable the business sector to create employment and\nboost the economy.\n\n* * *\n\n**Charlie Foo  \nVP and GM, Asia Pacific  \nMellanox Technologies **\n\nInnovation is the building block for sustainable competitive advantage in the\n21st century. National prosperity is created, not inherited. Innovation was\nthe secret sauce that propelled Singapore from Third World to First in the\nlast century. The incessant drive for continuous improvement and upgrade,\nassisted by technologies and strategies, helps produce a business-first\nmindset, world-class infrastructure and financial and political stability that\nSingapore is best known for today.\n\nI am hopeful the 2020 Budget will continue to put in measures to sharpen\nSingapore's competitive edge and the roles it plays on the global stage in the\nlong run, while inspiring new ideas and creating opportunities across\nexpanding industries in a sustainable way.\n\n* * *\n\n**Suganthi Shivkumar  \nMD for ASEAN, India and Korea  \nQlik **\n\nSingapore's 2020 Budget should address the importance of data literacy and\nrecognise its impact on the workforce. The data literacy gap is costing\nbusinesses across the globe billions of dollars in lost productivity annually.\nGiven that the data economy is in full swing, being data literate is no longer\nan option, and business leaders must do everything they can to ensure that\ntheir workforce is fully equipped with this skillset. With a foundation of\ndata literacy set in place, businesses can then enhance decision-making\nthrough the power of Augmented Intelligence, an approach which brings together\nthe best of machine intelligence and human intuition so smarter, bolder\ndiscoveries happen every day.\n\n* * *\n\n**Christina Teo  \nExecutive Director  \nSingapore Association of Pharmaceutical Industries (SAPI) **\n\nSingapore has made great strides in public health, with one of the highest\nlife expectancies in the world at 83 years at a remarkably efficient\nexpenditure of 5 per cent of GDP. However, on average, 10 of these years are\nspent in ill health, undermining Singaporeans' ability to live comfortably and\ncontribute further to the economy.\n\nTo address this, SAPI anticipates that Budget 2020 would invest further in\npreventive health care, such as providing further significant funding for\nvaccination subsidy and public awareness programmes; and increased funding for\ndiagnostics, including genetic testing, to detect conditions earlier resulting\nin better treatment outcomes.\n\nFor patients already living with illnesses such as cancer, rare diseases and\nchronic diseases, Singapore is a hub in South-east Asia for research,\ndevelopment and production of novel treatments that can extend and improve\nquality of life. Our 3M framework that encourages shared responsibility for\nfunding health care is unique and world-class. For instance, Medishield Life\nprovides immediate access to life-changing cancer treatment once approved in\nSingapore - faster than most countries.\n\nWe can further strengthen this framework by expanding coverage to include the\nfirst month of life, providing subsidies for all rare disease types beyond the\nselect identified ones, increasing claims limits for serious illnesses, and\nimproving flexibility of claims for outpatient treatments. While we can\nfurther enhance funding and subsidy, co-payment remains important to safeguard\nagainst the ''buffet syndrome''.\n\n* * *\n\n**Amit Anand  \nCo-Founder & Managing Partner  \nJungle Ventures **\n\nWhile Singapore is well on the path to become the country of choice for\nstartups in Asia, more measures can be taken to cement the attractiveness of\nthe country. For instance, it will be great to make Employee Stock Options\nPlan (ESOP)/Employee Share Ownership (ESOW) non-taxable for a couple of\ndecades to grow the ecosystem and attract higher quality global talent to\nSingapore - a critical element of building a leading startup ecosystem. While\na disruptive move, it will truly demonstrate Singapore's intent to support the\nrapidly growing wave of entrepreneurship globally.\n\n* * *\n\n**Naveen Menon  \nPresident ASEAN  \nCisco **\n\nOne of the key areas Budget 2020 should consider is how to encourage\nbusinesses to adopt flexible working arrangements especially in the burgeoning\ndigital economy. The success of flexible work arrangements, as evidenced by\nCisco's own experience, is a combination of several factors - good\ninfrastructure, suitable technology, and people's mindsets. Singapore already\nhas a head start in deploying world-class ICT infrastructure. As the country\nnow moves into the next wave of connectivity such as 5G and Wi-Fi6, there is a\nneed to ensure that such infrastructure is deployed with both scalability and\nsecurity in mind. On suitable technology, although leading-edge collaboration\ntechnologies are available today, full deployment and use of such technology\nstill only exists in pockets in Singapore. Budget 2020 can provide incentives\nfor companies to put in place and encourage the use of such technologies.\nLastly, one of the biggest challenges to enabling remote work is people's\nmindsets. It takes a shift in culture and an environment of trust for\nemployers and employees to telework effectively together. Budget 2020 can help\nby providing rebates for Singaporeans and businesses to adapt by training and\nretraining - both employers and employees - to equip us with the skills and\nmindset to fully leverage the advantages and capabilities of the ''workspace\nof the future.\n\n* * *\n\n**Maren Schweizer  \nDirector  \nSchweizer World Pte Ltd **\n\nA)Pave the way to a circular economy, by building trust and taking direct\nactions to manage climate change efficiently. Corporates and government should\nsteer outcomes jointly at a system level.\n\nB) Establish a landscape for technologies that don't exist.\n\nBased on emerging technologies, it's essential to evaluate what might come\nnext as the rate of change is speeding up. Innovation can offer solutions to\nthe challenges presented by our aging population, and the next ten years will\nbe critical for our preparations.\n\nC) Prepare for the makeup of the future workforce:\n\nIdentifying future roles, deciding on the skill sets needed to fill them, and\ndeveloping teaching strategies and educational organisations.\n\nNavigating the complexities of the transformative decade ahead requires trust.\nTherefore I see the need to review our governance models to harness the power\nof technology for good.\n\n* * *\n\n**David Baey  \nCo-Founder and CEO  \nMortgage Master **\n\nSingapore has done exceptionally well to nurture a thriving startup ecosystem\n- one that currently attracts 70 per cent of Southeast Asia's venture capital\nfunding, and boasts many emerging companies offering new services to improve\nour lives. As these startups scale, internationalise and export their\nservices, they create jobs and boost Singapore's economic competitiveness in\nthe long run.\n\nThe challenge for startups is competing with unicorns - with significantly\nlarger war chests - for the talent we need to scale. The local pool of\nsoftware developers and digital marketers is limited but demand continues to\nrise. We will therefore benefit greatly from the Budget offering rebates to\nlower the cost of hiring skilled labour and helping more accredited\ninstitutions provide reskilling programmes at a subsidised rate.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ng Yi Ming  \nManaging Partner  \nTribe Accelerator **\n\nNurturing entrepreneurship will help shape Singapore's future, and is thereby\na key area to address in Singapore's 2020 Budget. Removing the barriers to\nprogress like knowledge and collaboration gaps for businesses in the emerging\nfields like blockchain, AI and IoT will fuel their progress. The government\nhas already been showing immense support to drive the development of deep\ntechnologies and elevating these efforts will go a long way in securing\nSingapore's position as a smart, innovative and financially strong nation.\n\n* * *\n\n**Malina Platon  \nManaging Director, ASEAN  \nUiPath **\n\nSingapore needs to look ahead to become a Smart Nation and prepare for a\nfuture where our colleagues will come in both robot and human form. Automation\ntechnologies such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA) promise to drive greater\nproductivity and economic growth for many countries, especially Singapore\nwhich has made considerable investments in automation and Artificial\nIntelligence (AI).\n\nIn order for Singapore to thrive in the Automation First era, we need to\ninvest in ensuring the local workforce has the skills and abilities to be able\nto realise the potential of automation. Students - from primary school onwards\n- should be introduced to and taught automation and low coding programmes. Our\nuniversities should work with the private sector to incorporate automation\ntechnologies into their curriculums and companies should reskill and upskill\nexisting employees. The government should play a role in promoting these\nefforts and helping to fund where needed.\n\n* * *\n\n**Derek Wang  \nGeneral Manager, Singapore  \nAlibaba Cloud **\n\nSingapore's longstanding emphasis on the development of human capital has\ncontributed to its stellar economy and highly skilled workforce. As we chart a\nnew path forward in the new digital decade, Singapore must continue to upskill\nits workforce with the relevant knowledge and experience to excel in emerging\ntechnological trends such as AI and automation. As a member of Singapore's\nsociety, Alibaba Cloud is proud to be a part of the country's journey to\ntransform its digital natives into digital talents. We hope that our work with\nhigher and secondary/post-secondary institutions will help next-generation\ntalents hone their digital skillsets so Singapore's economy continues to punch\nabove its weight internationally in the long run.\n\n* * *\n\n**Nick Lim  \nGM, Asia Pacific and Japan  \nTIBCO **\n\nSingapore has always been supportive of the business sector, especially in\nhelping local businesses to gain a competitive edge. The government has also\nbeen committed to developing the skills and capabilities of local talent. The\nnext critical step will be to ensure continuous support for lifelong learning,\nthat will allow Singaporean companies to operate at a world-class level and be\nprepared for the digital economy.\n\nWe hope to see a continued emphasis on developing educational courses on new\ntechnologies, particularly in the field of data science, which will allow\norganisations to benefit and realise the value of data-driven business\ndecisions. Employers, educational institutions, and businesses must also play\na role in the ecosystem of educating the youth and upscaling the skills of\nSingaporean workers through committed partnerships and initiatives.\n\n* * *\n\n**Andie Rees  \nManaging Partner, South East Asia  \nOdgers Berndtson **\n\nWhile much has been said about reskilling workers so that they stay relevant,\nequally important is the need for business leaders to augment their\ncapabilities to lead their organisations forward. From our studies, successful\ncompanies are helmed by leaders who are agile, willing to embrace changes and\nare collaborative, which leads to greater staff confidence and commitment to\norganisational transformation process. Business leaders can be supported\nthrough continual and re-learning of leadership practices, and building of\ncommunities of practice. As a Chinese saying goes, while a fence is supported\nby three stakes, a capable man needs the support of three people. To this end,\nthere is value in building a robust ecosystem matching businesses, industry\nassociations and leadership institutions for learning, mentoring, greater\nnetworking and collaboration that may help leaders be better equipped to\nmanage through disruptions in whatever form that be.\n\n* * *\n\n**Lim Soon Hock  \nManaging Director  \nPLAN-B ICAG **\n\nSingapore should continue to be concerned with the lack of a critical mass of\nlarge local companies with global footprints. The Budget should address this,\nwhile there is still time, before it is too late, should foreign investments\nhollow out in the future to larger economies such as China, compelled by the\nneed to compete with the likes of Alibaba, Tencent or Huawei. There is the\ncritical need to ensure that the status quo - where Singaporeans have access\nto good and high paying jobs, as well as a high quality of life - can at least\nbe sustained.\n\nEnterprise Singapore's initiative to groom promising SMEs to become large\nlocal companies through Scale-up SG should be expanded to benefit more\ndeserving SMEs that need help to accelerate up the growth curve. The Budget\nshould seek to enhance quality over quantity in our large SMEs pool. It is not\nenough for SMEs to provide much of the employment in Singapore. There is an\nuntapped role for SMEs to offer high quality and rewarding jobs when some of\nthem evolve to be global players.\n\n* * *\n\n**Jessie Xia  \nMD, Southeast Asia  \nThoughtWorks **\n\nDigitally-ready talent will continue to be critical to Singapore's future, as\nthe country's robust Internet economy seeks to scale greater heights amidst an\nuncertain global climate.\n\nWith technological disruption already pervasive in all industries, the 2020\nBudget should aim to help companies raise their employees' digital\ncapabilities and soft skills - setting up internal initiatives and providing\ngrowth opportunities - to alleviate Singapore's ongoing job-skills mismatch\nand put companies in stronger positions to become truly modern digital\nbusinesses.\n\nThe Budget should also promote further collaboration between the tech industry\nand government, to foster deeper expertise in technologies including data,\ncloud, and platforms across the local talent pool.\n\n* * *\n\n**Toby Koh  \nGroup MD  \nAdemco Security Group **\n\nThe Singapore government has a reputation of planning for the long term. Hence\nmore targeted funding and effort have been invested in building longer-term\ncapabilities in our SMEs, the latest being Enterprise Singapore (ESG)'s Scale-\nup SG programme which Ademco Security Group is participating in. We are\nworking closely with McKinsey to sharpen our strategy across our Group,\nfocussing primarily on our overseas markets that have shown great potential\nand real traction, such as Vietnam, Philippines, India and Indonesia.\n\nI urge the government to continue to invest in promising Singapore firms that\ncan go out and grow regionally or even globally. Invest more resources in\nhelping committed companies build market access. This calls for more ESG boots\non the ground and other go-to-market resources. Getting a foothold in these\npromising markets is a priority and is certainly time-sensitive.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ronak Shah  \nChief Executive Officer  \nQBE Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd **\n\nComing into 2020, we see that issues such as technological disruption and\nclimate change that were major subjects of debate last year have continued to\nsee sustained attention on a national level. Considering our current volatile\nglobal economy, implementing training and continued skills upgrading\nprogrammes proactively is important and highly necessary in easing the steep\nlearning curve.\n\nWhile it is uncertain how far-reaching their effects can be on businesses\nhere, anticipating future needs and arming ourselves with the right tools and\nresources to mitigate these issues is how we can achieve long-term stability.\nBusinesses can also help to highlight the dialogue on key issues through\nactive participation and discussion at the grassroots level and as\nintermediaries for the public and government.\n\n* * *\n\n**Sng Khai Lin  \nCo-founder and CFO  \nFundnel Ltd **\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, support packages only provide temporary relief.\nAllowing people to fish the proverbial fish on their own would help a nation\nbetter navigate challenging climates. Today, private equity \u2014 a component of\ngrowing importance in a well-balanced investment portfolio \u2014 remains exclusive\nto the affluent because of an assumption that these accredited investors are\nmore financially-savvy. With proper education and regulatory support, retail\ninvestors can benefit from the private capital markets and, in turn, through\ninvestments, contribute to the economy.\n\n* * *\n\n**Bharath Vellore  \nManaging Director, Asia Pacific  \nAccuity **\n\nRising digitisation and automation is the reality of the world in today's\nworkplace, so the workforce must be prepared for this development. With\ninitiatives like SkillsFuture, the Singapore government has been upskilling\nworkers and we see sustained efforts continuing through Budget 2020 and a\nfocus on digital technologies.\n\nIn Singapore, the financial services and maritime industries are also a part\nof the digital transformation agenda, evident in initiatives like new digital\nbanking licences and the Networked Trade Platform (NTP). It is therefore\nimportant that the Budget reinforces these, as well as ancillary sectors, to\nhelp them keep up with regulatory requirements and the disruption around new\ntechnologies.\n\n* * *\n\n**Helen Ng  \nCEO  \nLock+Store **\n\nThe Singapore Budget 2020 should address the persistent challenges that SMEs\nface, namely, rising labour and other business costs. The implementation of\nthe Progressive Wage Model (PWM) amid a gloomy economic climate (which would\nlikely worsen due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus) has increased the\nfinancial burden on small businesses at a time when they are already\nstruggling to compete in the broader market. The Budget should also address\nthe administrative obstacles that small businesses face when applying for\ngrants and other subsidies. The application process is onerous and unlike\nlarge corporations, we do not necessarily have the resources to put together\nproposals that are ''ready for approval''.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ravindran Shanmugam  \nCountry Head, Singapore  \nLivspace **\n\nLocal firms need to build a culture of innovation, especially through\ntechnology, to remain globally competitive - and I hope this will be addressed\nin this year's Budget.\n\nThe interior design industry is a great example. Technology is transforming\nthe way homes are designed, visualised for customers, and built. A technology\nplatform brings together everyone involved in renovating a home (designers,\ncontractors, suppliers, customers) to deliver a transparent, high-quality,\nhassle-free experience.\n\nI would like to see the Budget increase funding for businesses looking to\ndevelop their technology platforms, so that this kind of experience is\navailable across more and more industries.\n\n* * *\n\n**Edwin Koh  \nDirector, Southeast Asia  \nLimelight Networks **\n\nAs Singapore gears up for 5G rollout in 2020, government and businesses should\nassess their 5G readiness to cope with growing levels of web traffic and\nInternet data. All these data must be processed quickly and reliably, and edge\ncomputing, with its capabilities to process data closer to each user, presents\ntransformative opportunities to improve latencies and reliability of services\nin the long run. However, to get there, the economy must take stock of\ninfrastructure requirements for enhanced mobile broadband, IoT, and mission-\ncritical applications, and put in place the necessary investments to realise\nthe performance potential of a 5G nation.\n\n* * *\n\n**Serkan Cetin  \nTechnical Director, APJ  \nOne Identity **\n\nCybersecurity was on top of the agenda in the 2019 Budget and the matter has\nsince gained significance. With 5G rolling out this year, new aspects of\ninterconnectivity will create unprecedented growth opportunities. However,\ntechnological advancements across industries may increase the risk exposure if\ncomprehensive internal and external cybersecurity measures are not\nimplemented. For instance, in 2019, 100 per cent of IT security professionals\nin Singapore who've experienced Pass the Hash attacks reported a direct impact\non their business, where most breaches involved compromised credentials within\norganisations' own systems.\n\nTherefore, the 2020 Budget should encourage enterprises to invest in building\ncyber resilience and emphasise the importance of digital security as a pillar\nof Singapore's digital defence framework.\n\n* * *\n\n**Leslie Ong  \nCountry Manager, Southeast Asia  \nTableau Software **\n\nBuilding a highly skilled, competent workforce and ensuring the employability\nof Singaporeans should remain a central economic goal and focus in this year's\nBudget. Jobs are evolving very quickly and there's a greater requirement not\nonly for specialised skills but also for the entire workforce to adopt and\nwork with new technologies. Working with data is one of the most imperative\nskills going into the future as the nation and businesses look to truly\ncapitalise on this valuable resource. The challenge is then to ensure that\nboth the current and the next generation of workers are equipped with the data\nskills they need to succeed in the future of work. The government has in place\nmany initiatives in upskilling the current workforce, but this needs to be\naccelerated if we want to propel the economy forward. From a longer-term\nperspective, we need to anticipate and skill-up the workforce of tomorrow. The\nBudget should address how education institutions can better anticipate and\nrespond to the skills needed to make today's students employable.\n\n* * *\n\n**Jean Thomas  \nChief Marketing Officer  \nPomelo Fashion **\n\nWith e-commerce growing at an unprecedented rate, e-commerce sales are\nprojected to top US$3.9 trillion this year. Whilst businesses realise that\nit's critical to shift towards digitisation to succeed and adapt to the new\nmarket reality, costs remain one of the largest roadblocks in their journey to\nscale up. To ensure differentiation from competitors as well as continued\nbusiness growth, there is a need to invest in cutting-edge technology, which\nmany successful brands have leveraged on to design great customer experiences.\nTo support high-growth companies to scale up and transform digitally, the\ngovernment can look at funding programmes as well as providing tax incentives.\n\n* * *\n\n**Praveen Kumar  \nGeneral Manager, Asia Pacific  \nASG Technologies **\n\nAs Singapore progresses towards becoming a Smart Nation, the government should\ncontinue to address enhancements in digital defence. Cyberattacks, data\nbreaches and system failures are some of the growing threats that demand the\ncountry's continuing vigilance. It is a key priority not only for businesses\nbut also for the government to heighten cyber defence capabilities, enhance\nprivacy controls and review existing policies, in order to achieve a greater\nlevel of collective cybersecurity. Digital technology is now an integral part\nof the Singapore infrastructure. Providing the right framework and policies,\nincluding enforcement of the same by the government, will ensure a safe and\nsecure technology environment.\n\n* * *\n\n**Sudhir Agarwal  \nCEO  \nEverise **\n\nSingapore has had consistency with its investments in education, healthcare,\nsecurity and infrastructure, allowing Singaporeans to enjoy one of the highest\nstandards of living in Asia. While Singapore's core challenges are of the\naging population and limited natural resources, Singapore's greatest strength\nhas always been its ability to think differently and think long-term. As 5G\nnetworks are set to connect the next generation of people, services and smart\nhomes, the 2020 Budget should address how it can seize the opportunity to\nbuild a transformational and sustainable ecosystem. To thrive longterm,\nSingapore needs to continue to invest in Artificial Intelligence, Internet of\nThings (IoT) and green-tech talent and IP. In times of uncertainty and rapid\ntechnological advances, we need to be innovative.\n\n* * *\n\n**April Tayson  \nDirector, Southeast Asia  \nAdjust **\n\nWith the rise of the digital economy, businesses in Singapore are embracing\nthe mobile economy with key technologies leading transformation in the nation.\nAdoption of emerging technology, such as artificial intelligence, robotics and\nthe Internet of Things is increasing as companies get ready to capitalise on\nfifth-generation (5G) mobile technology. In view of that, it would be\nexcellent if the government continues to provide grants and incentives in the\nmobile technology space to further encourage adoption such as the Startup SG\nTech initiative that supports local firms, ensuring that Singapore enterprises\nremain competitive in the global marketplace.\n\n* * *\n\n**Clara Lim  \nManaging Director, Asia Pacific  \ncommercetools **\n\nWith Southeast Asia's Internet economy continuing its rapid growth, the Budget\nshould look to help companies better integrate digital innovation, such as\necommerce tools and cloud-native services, which will become even more\npervasive at workplaces and in everyday lives.\n\nThe recent outbreak situation has also encouraged a surge in online\ntransactions and home deliveries as people opt to avoid public or crowded\nplaces. With brick-and-mortar sectors already affected - particularly in\nretail, F&B and hospitality - the Budget can minimise impact to the wider\neconomy, by helping ecommerce and delivery players shift towards more\ndigitally-integrated models. This might be done by encouraging adoption of\nheadless eCommerce solutions that enable real-time, on-the-fly adjustments to\nenable more individualised consumer experiences for business platforms.\n\n* * *\n\n**Andrew Chan  \nFounder and CEO  \nACI HR Solutions **\n\nWhilst I'm sure the 2020 Budget will contain some short-term assistance in\nlight of the coronavirus outbreak, ultimately for businesses to not only\nsurvive but to thrive in the future, it will rest on their effective\nutilisation of manpower and balancing that with how they integrate some form\nof digitalisation into their operation. This is where some companies may\nperhaps struggle as they're stuck in doing things the traditional way and are\nnot as prepared for the changing landscape; any government initiative that can\nassist in this transformation would be beneficial. No doubt our manpower is\nbetter qualified academically and technically today but efforts and\ninitiatives must continue to ensure it remains productive and future-ready.\n\n* * *\n\n**Sujith Sivaram  \nManaging Director  \nESCO Pte Ltd **\n\nTwo important long-term priorities would be\n\na) Enabling population growth by education and motivation. The social\nresponsibility of marrying, having and raising children should be taught and\ndrilled into young Singaporeans. Those who choose not to should have to pay a\nhigher price to remain in this society be it in terms of higher tax rates or\nhigher contributions to their long-terms savings.\n\nb) Enabling long-term learning and skills upgrading, by making it mandatory\nfor Singaporeans to upgrade their skills every 10 years until their\nretirement. Aiding employers to promote skills upgrading by allowing employees\npaid leave, allowing funding of these learning initiatives from long- term\nsavings, etc, are some measures that could boost lifelong learning.\n\n* * *\n\n**Andrew Tan  \nManaging Director, Singapore  \nHKBN JOS **\n\nWith global uncertainties and a tepid economic outlook, we are looking forward\nto seeing how the Singapore government will continue to help businesses,\nespecially SMEs, in Budget 2020.\n\nLabour shortage remains an issue in this manpower-lean economy. Instead of\ntapping foreign labour, it will be ideal for the Budget to address how\nbusinesses can leverage pro-business policies and strengthen digital\ncapabilities to achieve operational efficiency and stay sustainable.\n\nTo promote long-term business continuity planning, even before any\nunanticipated eventualities like the novel coronavirus outbreak, the Budget\ncan also include initiatives such as incentivising companies who adopt\nflexible working mechanism or digital investments subsidy which enables\nbusiness continuity. With soft consumer sentiments expected, businesses will\nalso need greater support to cope with rising business costs.\n\n* * *\n\n**Aaron Tan  \nCEO and Founder  \nCarro **\n\nThe economic impact of the ongoing novel Coronovirus has shown how vulnerable\nour economies are today. Being cognizant of this, the Budget should address\nboth short- and long-term concerns of businesses as they grapple with an\nincreasingly uncertain business environment. There needs to be continued\ninvestment in companies and technology that allows Singapore to grow beyond\njust being a strategic hub or a good spot for talent. As a country we should\nsupport local efforts to address important daily issues such as traffic\nmanagement, energy sustainability and financial empowerment. Introducing\npolicies and grants that support faster-scale and regionalisation of Singapore\ncompanies is crucial to creating stronger and sustainable local company\nsuccesses.\n\n* * *\n\n**Leonard Cheong  \nManaging Director  \nAdNovum Singapore Pte Ltd **\n\nSingapore's Budget needs to prepare the nation, people and businesses to\ninnovate, scale up, internationalise and adapt quickly to future challenges\nand an ever-changing economic landscape. The Budget should address:\n\n(1) Upskilling of elderly workers and women with digital skills coupled with a\nflexible work programme that will fit the needs of the digital economy - to\nencourage re-entry back to the workforce and ease the current resource\nconstraints\n\n(2) Deepening of businesses' enterprise capabilities and facilitating them to\nbecome a key ecosystem enabler in ASEAN, which will enhance Singapore's status\nas a business hub\n\n(3) Increased focus by the government to maintain a resilient environment and\ninfrastructure for the nation, people and businesses.\n\n* * *\n\n**Kelvin Chen  \nCEO & Co-Founder  \nKent Ridge Health **\n\nHealthcare spending will continue to rise as the population ages, and the\ngovernment will strive to ensure continued access to quality and affordable\nhealthcare. At the same time, any increase must be sustainable, with an eye on\ncosts, which are ultimately borne by all Singaporeans.\n\nAbout 70-80% of Singaporeans obtain their medical care within the public\nhealth system, yet the polyclinics and institutions are still overcrowded, and\npatients have to queue or are assigned an appointment date a couple of months\nlater when they might need immediate treatment. There are some private clinics\nthat might be less crowded. It would be great if the current system of\ndecanting patients will be able to automatically assign patients to those\nclinics. This could be a win-win for both public and private practices as the\npatients would not have to wait and the private clinics which have less\ntraffic would be able to help with these subsidised patients.\n\nAt KRH, through AI technology, myEUDA app is able to assign patients to our\npartner clinics with real traffic flow minimising wait time. It would be great\nif the government works more with private healthcare companies to leverage on\ntechnology to deliver better care for our patients\n\n* * *\n\n**Liz Kim  \nGeneral Manager  \nPhilip Morris, Singapore **\n\nThe 2020 Budget should continue to encourage businesses, big and small, to\ninnovate and transform their operating models by embracing new technology.\n\nWith transformation comes risk and uncertainty, but also the power to gain\nefficiencies and better outcomes for Singapore. The key to success will be\ncollaboration, and trust, between businesses, policy makers and society at\nlarge to ensure regulation keeps pace with innovation and societal demand.\n\n* * *\n\n**Dora Hoan  \nCEO  \nBest World International Ltd **\n\nBesides providing support measures for sectors hard-hit by the 2019-nCov\ncoronavirus outbreak, Singapore's 2020 Budget may focus on preparing the\neconomy to thrive in a rapidly changing global environment and to meet longer-\nterm domestic challenges, in particular, economic transformation. Allocations\nfor defence, infrastructure, education, and healthcare take priority.\n\nIn order to enhance the connectivity of our country as a global node, it is\ncritical to improve the capabilities of infrastructure facilities, such as 5G\nnetworks, MRT lines, airports, seaports. Infrastructure development allows\nagility to tackle innovation challenges. Meanwhile, digital defence is a new\naspect that also needs to be strengthened, to ensure a secure environment to\nsafeguard our critical interests. The education, skills upgrading, and\nhealthcare of Singapore residents have always been a continuing focus, to\nbuild a highly-skilled, digital-ready and diverse workforce to embrace the age\nof digital transformation.\n\n* * *\n\n**David Leong  \nManaging Director  \nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd **\n\nThis Budget is significant because it probably defines the collective\ndecisions of the 4G leadership and the future that it envisages for Singapore.\nWhile the Budget will set aside provisions for interim help for businesses, it\nalso has to prime the economy for future growth. Singapore's economy has to\ngrow on the back of intense regional and global competition while at the same\ntime dealing with stymied manpower growth. A Transformational Budget will be\ngood to set the tone and thrust of the government's focus in helping\nbusinesses shift from manpower-dependent production and service delivery to\none enabled by technology, robots and artificial intelligence.\n\nA reconfiguration for service and production deliveries will let Singapore\nplug into the global economy by becoming a central marketplace or hub with\nmanpower-light long-term strategies.\n\n* * *\n\n**Zaheer K Merchant  \nRegional Director (Singapore & Europe)  \nQI Group of Companies **\n\nOur Budget typically attempts to address various needs and priorities, often\nas equitably as possible. In current swirling times however, I am of the view\nthe Budget needs to address accelerated economic growth, provide businesses\nwith specific directions, evaluate disparities and ensure a ''one nation''\ninclusivity. This means that we do need specific tax rebates for businesses to\ngrow, a hold on any GST increase, and if we need to extend tax holidays to\nensure employment and manufacturing attractiveness, then this must be provided\nfor. My critical point is inclusivity however - as much as possible, no one\nshould be left behind. We have typified a neat capitalist economy. Perhaps\nwith difficult times comes the need for more social policies (though they\nneedn't be termed as such). But households need help, as do the needy,\nelderly, unemployed or under-employed. This can be in various forms of\nsubsidies or outright grants even if subject to some form of means test. But\nno one should be left behind.\n\n* * *\n\n**Henry Tan  \nGroup CEO  \nNexia TS Group **\n\nAs Singapore face the immediate challenges, there are also longer-term\nconcerns that will impact Singapore's future. Firstly, keeping Singapore\nrelevant in a world of technology changes by staying on top of the\ndevelopments and making Singapore an ideal place for innovation. Secondly,\nkeeping the cost of doing business in Singapore in pace with economic growth\nand not ahead of it by helping with wage credits. Thirdly, demonstrating\nSingapore's relevance in a highly connected world beyond being a major port or\nair travel hub. This entails demonstrating the value of the talent and\ncultural knowledge needed to navigate between the West and the East through\ncontinuous development of Singapore as a major education hub and think tank.\n\n* * *\n\n**Annie Yap  \nCEO  \nAYP HR Group **\n\nThere should be a greater emphasis and bigger budget to help Singapore\ncompanies globalise. The Enterprise Development grant introduced in Budget\n2018 was a great move to help firms internationalise and build capabilities,\nbut the set-up effort is taxing. Singapore's 2020 Budget could look into\nproviding grants or a one-time voucher for physical expenses like purchasing\nor renting office space and equipment in foreign countries. A list of trusted\nlocal organisations' contact details could also be shared so as to help\nSingapore firms get speedy assistance. Alternatively, the advantages and\nbenefits of expanding business in particular foreign countries should be\npromoted widely among Singapore firms. I believe that, with more help in\npaving the way to enter foreign markets, more SMEs will work towards the goal\nof globalisation.\n\n* * *\n\n**Teong Eng Guan  \nVice President, ASEAN  \nPalo Alto Networks **\n\nSingapore's resilience in weathering the challenges that lie ahead will\nlargely be determined by the government's continued investments in strong\ncyber defences to guard against ever-evolving cyber threats. Afterall, the\ntrue impact of a cyber attack in an era of IoT cannot be overestimated.\n\nHowever this is a shared responsibility, and future Budgets will need to\nensure that everyone is amply supported with the necessary education,\nawareness and resources to protect the digital infrastructure powering our\nopen and connected economy.\n\nRecent reports of hackers exploiting coronavirus virus fears to spread malware\nis a prime example of how cyber criminals will not hesitate to take advantage\nof every opportunity to cause damage, further underscoring the need for\ncybersecurity to be regarded as an important national priority.\n\n* * *\n\n**Matthew Bennett  \nVP and MD, Asia Pacific & Japan  \nVMware Carbon Black **\n\nIncreasing geopolitical tension has amplified the risk of state-sponsored\ncyberattacks that target critical infrastructures and compromise national\nsecurity. Also, cloud technology has created opportunities for governments to\nbuild robust cybersecurity programmes comprising prevention, detection,\nresponse and prediction. However, deploying new Internet-connected services\nwithout proper security will increase attack surfaces.\n\nThe Singapore government may want to invest in bolstering cybersecurity and\ncultivating expertise in this area. The Budget can also be allocated to\nencouraging public-private sector collaboration to address cybersecurity\nchallenges that no doubt will intensify in the long run. We all face a common\nadversary in cyber attackers and need to harness a united front to overcome\nvulnerabilities.\n\n* * *\n\n**Ong Pang Thye  \nManaging Partner  \nKPMG in Singapore **\n\nAs smarter technology becomes more pervasive in our everyday lives, along with\nthe compounding effects of natural crises, there is a fundamental need for\nenterprises to transform, particularly in the areas of digital and\nsustainability.\n\nSuch a need presents a timely opportunity for Singapore to establish herself\nas the Transformation Capital of Asia for the future, and when we further\nmaster and export this expertise of transformation as a business, it would\nultimately help to increase the tax revenue base and, in turn, lift the income\nof people.\n\n* * *\n\n**Chia Ngiang Hong  \nPresident  \nReal Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (REDAS) **\n\nPrioritising efforts to enable enterprises and workers build deep capabilities\nto enable the successful transformation of our economy remains crucial. So\ndoes preparing and grooming our children early in life through continuous\nlearning to be leaders, innovators and entrepreneurs of the future. In view of\nprevailing growing anti-globalisation sentiments and our small domestic\nmarket, it is imperative that our government, institutions, enterprises and\npeople double-up efforts to build strong partnerships, both within and outside\nSingapore, and making the region and the world our stage and our market.\nClimate change is another important longer term issue and this can take the\nform of enhancing infrastructure and other pre-emptive measures to combat\nrising sea levels, urban heat and carbon footprint to ensure a more liveable\nenvironment. Fostering a caring and inclusive society, strengthening our\nsocial fabric and mitigating growing unease over social inequality and divide\nis also important.\n\n* * *\n\n**Patrick Lee  \nCEO  \nStandard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Ltd **\n\nChanging demographics, digital disruption, trade protectionism and climate\nchange are longer-term issues that businesses must continue to keep a close\nwatch on. The Budget needs to address these through continued efforts to\nupskill Singapore's workforce, accelerate digital transformation and\ninnovation, deepen global trade linkages and create a blueprint for\nsustainable growth.\n\nSingapore's continued success will depend on whether it can sustain its role\nas a catalytic node in the global economy. As digital transformation continues\napace, Singapore must seize the opportunity and reinvent itself as a hub for\nglobal trade and financial flows. Efforts to promote trade digitalisation and\ndigital banking must be prioritised. They are certainly at the forefront of\nStandard Chartered's strategy in Singapore.\n\nWe are proud to be part of a global agreement to accelerate the adoption of\ndigital technologies in trade and commerce. We will continue to invest in new\ncapabilities in Singapore, eg we launched an FX e-trading and pricing engine,\nand help our people stay relevant through our SkillsFuture@sc programme.\n\n**READ

They know\ntheir strategies, organizational capabilities, resources, and management\nsystems should all be arranged to support the enterprise\u2019s purpose. The\nchallenge is that executives tend to focus on one of these areas to the\nexclusion of the others, but what really matters for performance is how they\nall fit together.\n\nConsider McDonald\u2019s. What does it take to be able to serve over 1% of the\nworld\u2019s population \u2014 more than 70 million customers \u2014 every day and in\nvirtually every country across the world? Fanatical attention to the design\nand management of scalable processes, routines, and a working culture by which\nsimple, stand-alone, and standardized products are sold globally at a\npredictable, and therefore manageable, volume, quality, and cost. Maximizing\neconomies of scale lies at the heart of McDonald\u2019s product-centric business\nmodel. Efficiency is built into the design of its winning organization in the\nform of formalized hierarchies of performance accountability, a high division\nof labor, routinization of specialist tasks, and teamwork at the point of\nsale. McDonald\u2019s has been the market leader in its sector for decades.\n\nThis is what enterprise alignment looks like. It means winning through a\ntightly managed enterprise value chain that connects an enterprise\u2019s _purpose_\n(what we do and why we do it) to its _business strategy_ (what we are trying\nto win at to fulfill our purpose), _organizational capability_ (what we need\nto be good at to win), _resource architecture_ (what makes us good), and,\nfinally, _management systems_ (what delivers the winning performance we need).\nThe enterprise value chain is only as strong as its weakest link.\n\n![W160125_TREVOR_INTERDEPENDENTCOMPONENTS\n\\(1\\)](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/01/W160125_TREVOR_INTERDEPENDENTCOMPONENTS-1.png)\n\n\n\nConsider the following questions, ideally with your team. You might ask them\nabout the enterprise overall, or about a single strategically important\nbusiness line, activity or function.\n\n**Enterprise purpose: What do we do and why do we do it?  **Purpose is the\nloadstone upon which every enterprise is built. Financial success is the\nconsequence of commercial enterprises fulfilling their purposes well, but it\nis not to be confused with enterprise purpose itself. Profit, for example, is\nrarely a positive focus for people\u2019s effort.\n\nConsider your own case: What is the enduring purpose of your enterprise? Why\nwould it matter if you went out of business tomorrow, and who would care? Is\nyour purpose clear enough that your investors, employees, partners, and\ncustomers could articulate it?\n\n**Business strategy: What are we trying to win at to fulfill our purpose?\n**If purpose is what the enterprise exists to achieve and why it matters, then\nbusiness strategy is planning for what the enterprise must win at to fulfill\nits purpose. Unlike its purpose, an enterprise\u2019s strategy should flex and\nmorph in response to future opportunities and threats. The degree to which\nyour enterprise\u2019s business strategy fulfills its purpose is the measure of its\neffectiveness.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company\u2019s\n[purpose](https://disneyinstitute.com/blog/2012/09/common-purpose-how-to-\ninspire-your-staff/100/) is to \u201ccreate happiness by providing the finest in\nentertainment for people of all ages, everywhere.\u201d  _How_ Disney creates\nhappiness is by offering a range of consumer products (Disney Store,\npublishing, licensing), entertainment (Walt Disney Studios, Pixar, Marvel),\nand experiences (parks and resorts). It wins by pursuing high performance in\neach area and by using each to support the others.\n\nConsider the following strategic questions for your own enterprise: What are\nyour offerings to customers, in the form of products and services, and are\nthey consistent with your purpose? What\u2019s missing? What do you do or offer\nthat you shouldn\u2019t? Who are your customers, and what are they demanding of the\nproducts and services you offer, now and in the future? Who are your\ncompetitors, and what are they capable of offering that you aren\u2019t? How do you\nneed to be different to compete and win?\n\n**Organizational  capability: What do we need to be good at to win? **Business\nstrategy receives the lion\u2019s share of executives\u2019 attention, but even the best\nstrategy is useless unless supported by appropriate organizational\ncapabilities. It is a reckless leadership team that commits to a business\nstrategy without knowing whether they can achieve it. Traditionally,\nbusinesses competed on their ability to execute their planned strategies for\nmatching supply to demand as efficiently as possible. Many enterprises will\ncontinue to operate this way in future, but additional capabilities are\nincreasingly important: the strategic value of organizational capabilities\nsuch as agility (around the customer), connectivity (between complementary\nofferings), and innovativeness (to explore novel opportunities).\n\nConsider your own organizational capabilities: What do you need to be really\ngood at to successfully achieve your winning strategy? What are you capable of\norganizationally that your rivals are not? How do you become uniquely capable\nof fulfilling what markets and customers are demanding of you, now and in the\nfuture?\n\n**Resource architecture: What makes us good? (And how good are we?)\n**Strategically aligned enterprises are made capable by their organizational\nresources, including people, structures, cultures, and work processes, and by\nthe degree to which they are [configured to be strategically\nvaluable](https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Design-Power-Organizational-\nArchitecture/dp/0195099176).  _People_ reflect the value of skills,\nexperience, and knowledge required to perform the enterprise\u2019s work;\n_structure_ reflects the value of formal and informal relationships, networks,\nand functional connections through which work is structured; _processes_\nreflect the value of planned and ad hoc work processes and routines through\nwhich work is performed, and in which valuable knowledge is retained\n[organizationally](https://www.jstor.org/stable/259373?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents);\nand  _culture_ reflects the values, beliefs, and attitudes [that guide\neveryday working\nbehavior](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118047052.html).\n\nConsider your own resources: What type of people are core to you being\nsuperior at the things you need to be good at to win? What type of culture\nmight support collaboration between complementary lines of business, if your\nbusiness strategy depends upon it? What types of work processes are critical\nto your ability for inventiveness? What type of structure will enable you to\nbe agile enough to compete for and win fickle customers repeatedly?\n\n**Management  systems: What delivers the winning performance we need?\n**Management systems include all aspects of management infrastructure,\noperations, and tactics, from information systems to employee performance\nmanagement. What management practices, systems, and technologies best fit your\nwinning strategy for fulfilling your enterprise\u2019s purpose? What are\nappropriate measures of success, both short and long term? Where is the focus\nof effort and attention managerially in your enterprise, and is it aligned to\nhow you plan to win?\n\n### **Four Reasons for Misaligned Enterprises**\n\nSo far, so straightforward. So why do many businesses go off the rails? Of\nmany factors, there are four main reasons for misaligned enterprises:\n\n  * **Enterprise leaders are unaware of the risks of misalignment.**  Many senior executives we talk to do not think of their enterprises as connected and coherent value chains. Their primary focus is all too often on their enterprise\u2019s structure as articulated by the org chart. The main operating units described there are seen as being the primary components of \u201cvalue.\u201d Alignment thinking requires _all_ decision makers to view their enterprise as a value chain, not merely a set of more or less valuable boxes and wires on an easy-to-forget, ever-changing chart. What are the typical alignment debates in your enterprise? How often you have them, and with whom, relates to our second reason for misaligned enterprise.\n  * **Nobody \u201cowns\u201d enterprise alignment.**  Generally, no individual or group is functionally responsible for overseeing the arrangement of the enterprise from end to end. Multiple individuals and groups are responsible for different components of the enterprise value chain, and usually they are not as joined up as they should be. All too often individual leaders seek to protect and optimize their own domains and components, rather than align and improve across the entire enterprise. Who is responsible for ensuring your enterprise is as strategically aligned as it should be? The answer cannot be \u201cnobody\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Neither can the answer be \u201cthe CEO\u201d (or equivalent). Modern enterprises are too complex for their design and management to be left to chance or to rely solely on the wisdom of one individual.\n  * **Complexity makes enterprise alignment that much harder.**  Achieving and sustaining high enterprise alignment is hard, especially in a rapidly changing operating environment. Complexity usually arises as the result of four primary factors: number of employees, variety of business lines, variety and expectations of differing customer groups, and geographical dispersal. Large, diversified, and geographically dispersed enterprises, in whichever sectors they compete, require the greatest amount of strategic effort by their leadership to be aligned. How complex is your enterprise, and how well-equipped is your leadership team to beat the alignment challenge?\n  * **Activity is mistaken for  progress.** The killer questions outlined in the previous section require sound judgment, courage, time, and energy to answer. The frantic activity of business as usual can get in the way of the in-depth discussions and tough choices that need to take place regularly to lead a strategically aligned enterprise (and maintain it). Ensuring that the whole of the enterprise is as aligned as possible  _should_ be business as usual for enterprise leaders. Without an idealized vision and understanding of their best selves, many enterprises lack the direction, scale of ambition, or impetus required to fulfill their potential.\n\nIn summary, strategically aligned enterprises have a much better chance of\nwinning in today\u2019s challenging business environment. To win, enterprise\nleaders must find their own distinctive approach to aligning their business\nstrategies, organizational capabilities, valuable resources, and management\nsystems to fulfill their enterprise\u2019s purpose. However, when confronted by the\nscale of their enterprise alignment challenge, we believe many leaders balk at\nthe opportunity for positive but difficult change because of the unrelenting\npressure for short-term results. The penalty is unsustainable performance and\nan uncertain future.\n\n* * *\n\n[Jonathan Trevor](/search?term=jonathan%20trevor&search_type=search-all) is\nAssociate Professor of Management Practice at Oxford University's Said\nBusiness School.\n\n* * *\n\n[Barry Varcoe](/search?term=barry%20varcoe&search_type=search-all) is an\nAssociate Fellow at Oxford University's Said Business School.\n\n* * *\n\n###### This article is about [STRATEGY](/topic/strategy)\n\n__Follow this topic\n\n__Following\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\n#### Partner Center\n\n[Coronavirus](/insight-center/coronavirus) [Magazine](/magazine)\n[Popular](/most-popular) [Topics](/topics) [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n[Video](/video) [Store](/store) [The Big Idea](/big-ideas) [Visual\nLibrary](/visual-library) [Reading Lists](/reading-lists) [Case\nSelections](/case-selections)\n\n[![Harvard Business Review Home](/resources/css/images/hbr_logo.svg)](/)\n\n[**Subscribe**](/subscribe)\n\n###### Explore HBR\n\n  * [The Latest](/the-latest)\n  * [Most Popular](/most-popular)\n  * [All Topics](/topics)\n  * [Magazine Archive](/magazine)\n  * [The Big Idea](/big-ideas)\n  * [Reading Lists](/reading-lists)\n  * [Case Selections](/case-selections)\n  * [Video](/video)\n  * [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n  * [Webinars](/webinars)\n  * [Visual Library](/visual-library)\n  * [My Library](/my-library)\n  * [Newsletters](/email-newsletters)\n  * [HBR Ascend](https://hbrascend.org/)\n\n###### HBR Store\n\n  * [Article Reprints](/store/articles)\n  * [Books](/store/books)\n  * [Cases](/store/case-studies)\n  * [Collections](/store/collections)\n  * [Magazine Issues](/store/magazine-issues)\n  * [HBR Guide Series](/store/landing/guides)\n  * [HBR 20-Minute Managers](/store/landing/20-minute-managers)\n  * [HBR Emotional Intelligence Series](/store/landing/emotional-intelligence-series)\n  * [HBR Must Reads](/store/landing/mustreads)\n  * [Tools](/store/tools)\n\n###### About HBR\n\n  * [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n  * [Advertise with Us](/hbr-advertising-sales)\n  * [Information for Booksellers/Retailers](/booksellers-retailers)\n  * [Masthead](/about-hbr)\n  * [Global Editions](/global-editions)\n  * [Media Inquiries](/media-inquiries)\n  * [Guidelines for Authors](/guidelines-for-authors-web)\n  * [HBR Analytic Services](/hbr-analytic-services)\n\n###### HBR Subscriber Assistance\n\n  * [Subscribe](/subscribe)\n  * [Subscriber Help](/subscriber-help)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.274.3214](tel:+18002743214)  \n[harvard@cdsfulfillment.com](mailto:harvard@cdsfulfillment.com)  \n[hbr.org/subscriberservices](/subscriberservices)\n\n  * International:  \n[+44.1858.438.412](tel:+441858438412)  \n[(Asia Pacific: +61.2.9158.6127)](tel:+61291586127)  \n[hbr@subscription.co.uk](mailto:hbr@subscription.co.uk)  \n[subscription.co.uk/hbr/help](https://www.subscription.co.uk/hbr/help)\n\n###### HBR.ORG Customer Assistance\n\n  * [Help Center](/help-customer-service-home)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.988.0886](tel:+18009880886)\n\n  *   * International:  \n[617.783.7500](tel:+16177837500)\n\n  * Email:  \n[customerservice@harvardbusiness.org](mailto:customerservice@harvardbusiness.org)\n\n  * [Copyright Permissions](/permissions)\n\n###### Follow HBR\n\n  * __[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/HBR)\n  * __[Twitter](http://twitter.com/HarvardBiz)\n  * __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review?trk=biz-companies-cym)\n  * __[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harvard_business_review/?hl=en)\n  * __[Your Newsreader](http://feeds.hbr.org/harvardbusiness/)\n\n![Harvard Business Publishing](/resources/images/2018/new_logo_May11.png)\n\n  * [About Us](/corporate/about)\n  * [Careers](/corporate/careers)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n  * [Copyright Information](/corporate/copyright)\n  * [Trademark Policy](http://trademark.harvard.edu/pages/trademark-notice)\n\n  \n\nHarvard Business Publishing:\n\n  * [Higher Education](http://hbsp.harvard.edu/)\n  * [Corporate Learning](http://www.harvardbusiness.org)\n  * [Harvard Business Review](http://hbr.org/)\n  * [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Harvard Business School Publishing.

No wonder, then, that managing human capital is a top challenge for\ncompanies.\n\nTo address it, say the authors, CEOs must redefine and elevate the CHRO role.\nThey should spell out their expectations in a new written contract, focusing\non three contributions that the CHRO, as an expert on talent (both in-house\nand at the competition), should be making: _predicting the outcomes_ of\nstrategically deploying human resources, _diagnosing people-related problems_\nthat are hurting the company's performance, and _prescribing actions_ on the\npeople side that will create value. Administrative tasks, such as managing\nbenefits, might be delegated to others. And the CHRO should be assessed by\nactions that deliver revenue, margin, brand recognition, or market share.\n\nWith a new mandate from the CEO, and with appropriate business training, the\nCHRO can contribute to the organization just as powerfully as the CFO can.\nIndeed, the CEO should partner with the CHRO and the CFO in what the authors\ncall a G3--a triumvirate to steer the company. Although reshaping the HR\nfunction could take three years or more, the authors' experience with\ncompanies such as GE and BlackRock suggests that it's well worth the effort.\n\nHBR Reprint R1507D\n\n#### Idea in Brief\n\n##### The Problem\n\nCEOs consistently rank human capital as a top challenge, but they typically\nundervalue their chief human resources officer and view HR as less important\nthan other functions.\n\n##### The Solution\n\nThe chief human resources officer must become a true strategic partner to the\nCEO.\n\n##### The Approach\n\nThe CEO must rewrite the CHRO\u2019s job description and create a core decision-\nmaking body comprising the CEO, CFO, and CHRO.\n\nCEOs know that they depend on their company\u2019s human resources to achieve\nsuccess. Businesses don\u2019t create value; people do. But if you peel back the\nlayers at the vast majority of companies, you find CEOs who are distanced from\nand often dissatisfied with their chief human resources officers (CHROs) and\nthe HR function in general.\n[Research](http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/insights/leadership/decoding%20leadership%20what%20really%20matters/state_of_human_capital_2012.ashx)\nby McKinsey and the Conference Board consistently finds that CEOs worldwide\nsee human capital as a top challenge, and they rank HR as only the eighth or\nninth most important function in a company. That has to change.\n\nIt\u2019s time for HR to make the same leap that the finance function has made in\nrecent decades and become a true partner to the CEO. Just as the CFO helps the\nCEO lead the business by raising and allocating financial resources, the CHRO\nshould help the CEO by building and assigning talent, especially key people,\nand working to unleash the organization\u2019s energy. Managing human capital must\nbe accorded the same priority that managing financial capital came to have in\nthe 1980s, when the era of the \u201csuper CFO\u201d and serious competitive\nrestructuring began.\n\nCEOs might complain that their CHROs are too bogged down in administrative\ntasks or that they don\u2019t understand the business. But let\u2019s be clear: It is up\nto the CEO to elevate HR and to bridge any gaps that prevent the CHRO from\nbecoming a strategic partner. After all, it was CEOs who boosted the finance\nfunction beyond simple accounting. They were also responsible for creating the\nmarketing function from what had been strictly sales.\n\nElevating HR requires totally redefining the work content of the chief human\nresources officer\u2014in essence, forging a new contract with this leader\u2014and\nadopting a new mechanism we call the G3\u2014a core group comprising the CEO, the\nCFO, and the CHRO. The result will be a CHRO who is as much a value adder as\nthe CFO. Rather than being seen as a supporting player brought in to implement\ndecisions that have already been made, the CHRO will have a central part in\ncorporate decision making and will be properly prepared for that role.\n\nThese changes will drive important shifts in career paths for HR\nexecutives\u2014and for other leaders across the company. Moreover, the business\nwill benefit from better management of not just its financial resources but\nalso its human ones. We say this with confidence, based on our experience with\ncompanies such as General Electric, BlackRock, Tata Communications, and Marsh,\nall of which act on their commitment to the people side of their businesses.\n\n## The CEO\u2019s New Contract with the CHRO\n\nA CFO\u2019s job is partly defined by the investment community, the board, outside\nauditors, and regulators. Not so for the CHRO role\u2014that\u2019s defined solely by\nthe CEO. The chief executive must have a clear view of the tremendous\ncontribution the CHRO could be making and spell out those expectations in\nclear, specific language. Putting things in writing ensures that the CEO and\nCHRO have a shared understanding of appropriate actions and desirable outputs.\n\nTo start redefining the job, the CEO should confer with his or her team and\nkey board members, particularly the board\u2019s compensation committee (more aptly\ncalled the talent and compensation committee), and ask what they expect in an\nideal CHRO. Beyond handling the usual HR responsibilities\u2014overseeing employee\nsatisfaction, workforce engagement, benefits and compensation, diversity, and\nthe like\u2014what should an exemplary CHRO do?\n\nHere are three activities we think are critical: predicting outcomes,\ndiagnosing problems, and prescribing actions on the people side that will add\nvalue to the business. Some of these things may seem like the usual charter\nfor a CHRO, but they are largely missing in practice, to the disappointment of\nmost CEOs.\n\n### Predicting outcomes.\n\nCEOs and CFOs normally put together a three-year plan and a one-year budget.\nThe CHRO should be able to assess the chances of meeting the business goals\nusing his knowledge of the people side. How likely is it, for example, that a\nkey group or leader will make timely changes in tune with rapid shifts in the\nexternal environment, or that team members will be able to coordinate their\nefforts? CHROs should raise such questions and offer their views.\n\nBecause a company\u2019s performance depends largely on the fit between people and\njobs, the CHRO can be of enormous help by crystallizing what a particular job\nrequires and realistically assessing whether the assigned person meets those\nrequirements. Jobs that are high leverage require extra attention. Many HR\nprocesses tend to treat all employees the same way, but in our observation, 2%\nof the people in a business drive 98% of the impact. Although coaching can be\nhelpful, particularly when it focuses on one or two things that are preventing\nindividuals from reaching their potential, it has its limits. Nothing\novercomes a poor fit. A wide gap between a leader\u2019s talents and the job\nrequirements creates problems for the leader, her boss, her peers, and her\nreports. So before severe damage is done, the CHRO should take the initiative\nto identify gaps in behavior or skills, especially among those 2% and as job\nrequirements change.\n\nThe CHRO, with the CFO, should also consider whether the key performance\nindicators, talent assignments, and budgets are the right ones to deliver\ndesired outcomes. If necessary, the pair should develop new metrics. Financial\ninformation is the most common basis for incentivizing and assessing\nperformance, because it is easy to measure, but the CHRO can propose\nalternatives. People should be paid according to how much value they\ncontribute to the company\u2014some combination of the importance of the job and\nhow they handle it. Finance and HR should work together to define ahead of\ntime the value that is expected, using qualitative as well as quantitative\nfactors. Imagine the leaders of those functions discussing a business unit\nmanager and triangulating with the CEO and the group executive to better\nunderstand what the manager needs to do to outperform the competition in the\nheat of battle. For example, to move faster into digitization, will he have to\nreconstitute the team or reallocate funds? Predicting success means weighing\nhow well-attuned the manager is to outside pressures and opportunities, how\nresilient he would be if the economy went south, and how quickly he could\nscale up into digitization. The specific metrics would be designed\naccordingly.\n\nAs another example, a top marketing manager might have to build capability for\nusing predictive data in advertising. The CFO and CHRO should recognize that\nif the manager fails to steep herself in the fundamentals of data analytics\nand is slow to hire people with that expertise, new competitors could come in\nand destroy value for the company. Metrics should reflect how quickly the\nmarketing head acts to reorient her department. One set of metrics would focus\non the recruiting plan: What steps must the marketing manager take by when?\nThese become milestones to be met at particular points in time. Another set of\nmetrics might focus on budget allocations: Once the new people are hired and\nassimilated, is the manager reallocating the marketing budget? And is that\nmoney in fact helping to increase revenue, margins, market share in selected\nsegments, or brand recognition? Such improvements are measurable, though with\na time lag.\n\nThe CHRO should also be able to make meaningful predictions about the\ncompetition. Just as every army general learns about his counterpart on the\nenemy side, the CHRO should be armed with information about competitors and\nhow their key decision makers and executors stack up against those at the\nCHRO\u2019s organization. Predictions should include the likely impact of any\nchanges related to human resources at rival companies\u2014such as modifications to\ntheir incentive systems, an increase in turnover, or new expertise they are\nhiring\u2014and what those changes might signify about their market moves. In 2014,\nfor instance, Apple began to hire medical technology people\u2014an early warning\nsign that it might make a heavy push to use its watch and perhaps other Apple\ndevices for medical purposes. Such activity could have implications for a\nhealth care business, a medical device manufacturer, or a clinic. Similarly, a\ncompetitor\u2019s organizational restructuring and reassignment of leaders might\nindicate a sharper focus on product lines that could give your company a\ntougher run.\n\nIntelligence about competitors is often available through headhunters, the\npress, employees hired from other companies, suppliers, or customers\u2019\ncustomers. Even anecdotal information, such as \u201cThe marketing VP is a numbers\nguy, not a people guy,\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019s a cost cutter and can\u2019t grow the business,\u201d\nor \u201cThe head of their new division comes from a high-growth company,\u201d can\nimprove the power of prediction. For example, Motorola might have been able to\nanticipate the iPhone if the company\u2019s CHRO had alerted the CEO when Apple\nbegan trying to recruit Motorola\u2019s technical people.\n\nThe CHRO should make comparisons unit by unit, team by team, and leader by\nleader, looking not only at established competitors but also at nontraditional\nones that could enter the market. Is the person who was promoted to run hair\ncare at X company more experienced and higher-energy than our new division\nhead? Does the development team in charge of wireless sensors at Y company\ncollaborate better than we do? The answers to such questions will help predict\noutcomes that will show up as numbers on a financial statement sometime in the\nfuture.\n\n### Diagnosing problems.\n\nThe CHRO is in a position to pinpoint precisely why an organization might not\nbe performing well or meeting its goals. CEOs must learn to seek such analysis\nfrom their CHROs instead of defaulting to consultants.\n\nThe CHRO should work with the CEO and CFO to examine the causes of misses,\nbecause most problems are people problems. The idea is to look beyond obvious\nexternal factors, such as falling interest rates or shifting currency\nvaluations, and to link the numbers with insights into the company\u2019s social\nsystem\u2014how people work together. A correct diagnosis will suggest the right\nremedy and avoid any knee-jerk replacements of people who made good decisions\nbut were dealt a bad hand.\n\nIf the economy slumped and performance lagged compared to the previous year,\nthe question should be, How did the leader react? Did he get caught like a\ndeer in the headlights or go on the offensive? How fast did he move, relative\nto the competition and the external change? This is where the CHRO can help\nmake the critical distinction between a leader\u2019s misstep and any fundamental\nunsuitability for the job. Here too the CHRO will learn new things about the\nleader, such as how resilient he is\u2014information that will be useful in\nconsidering future assignments.\n\nBut focusing on individual leaders is only half the equation. The CHRO should\nalso be expert at diagnosing how the various parts of the social system are\nworking, systematically looking for activities that are causing bottlenecks or\nunnecessary friction. When one CEO was reviewing the numbers for an important\nproduct line, he saw a decline in market share and profits for the third year\nin a row. The medical diagnostic product that the group was counting on to\nreverse the trend was still not ready to launch. As he and his CHRO dug in,\nthey discovered that the marketing team in Milwaukee and the R&D team in\nFrance had not agreed on the specifications. On the spot, they arranged a\nseries of face-to-face meetings to resolve the disconnect.\n\nThere is great value in having the CHRO diagnose problems and put issues on\nthe table, but such openness is often missing. Behaviors such as withholding\ninformation, failing to express disagreement but refusing to take action, and\nundermining peers often go unnoticed. Some CEOs look the other way rather than\ntackle conflicts among their direct reports, draining energy and making the\nwhole organization indecisive. Take, for example, problems that arise when\ncollaboration across silos doesn\u2019t happen. In such situations, no amount of\ncost cutting, budget shifting, or admonition will stem the deterioration. Thus\nCHROs who bring dysfunctional relationships to the surface are worth their\nweight in gold.\n\nAt the same time, the CHRO should watch for employees who are energy creators\nand develop them. Whether or not they are directly charged with producing\nresults, these are the people who get to the heart of issues, reframe ideas,\ncreate informal bonds that encourage collaboration, and in general make the\norganization healthier and more productive. They may be the hidden power\nbehind the group\u2019s value creation.\n\n### Prescribing actions to add value.\n\nAgile companies know they must move capital to where the opportunities are and\nnot succumb to the all-too-typical imperatives of budgeting inertia (\u201cYou get\nthe same funding as last year, plus or minus 5%\u201d). When McKinsey looked at\ncapital allocation patterns in more than 1,600 U.S. companies over 15 years,\nit\n[found](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/strategy/how_to_put_your_money_where_your_strategy_is)\nthat aggressive reallocators\u2014companies that shifted more than 56% of capital\nacross businesses during that time\u2014had 30% higher total shareholder returns\nthan companies that shifted far less.\n\nCompanies should be similarly flexible with their human capital, and CHROs\nshould be prepared to recommend actions that will unlock or create value.\nThese might include recognizing someone\u2019s hidden talent and adding that\nindividual to the list of high potentials, moving someone from one position to\nanother to ignite growth in a new market, or bringing in someone from the\noutside to develop capability in a new technology. Although capital\nreallocation is important, the reassignment of people along with capital\nreallocation is what really boosts companies.\n\nResponding to the external environment today sometimes requires leaders with\ncapabilities that weren\u2019t previously cultivated, such as knowledge of\nalgorithms, or psychological comfort with digitization and rapid change. The\ncompany might have such talent buried at low levels. To have impact, those\nindividuals might need to be lifted three organizational levels at once rather\nthan moved incrementally up existing career ladders. The CHRO should be\nsearching for people who could be future value creators and then thinking\nimaginatively about how to release their talent. Judging people must be a\nspecial skill of the CHRO, just as the CFO has a knack for making inferences\nfrom numbers.\n\nDow Chemical found that aggressively hiring entrepreneurial millennials was\nthe fastest way to create more \u201cshort-cycle innovation\u201d alongside the\ncompany\u2019s traditional long-cycle R&D processes. The share of employees under\nage 30 went from 9% in 2004 to 15% in 2014. To benefit from this new talent,\nthe company also revamped its career paths to move the 20- and 30-somethings\ninto bigger jobs relatively quickly, and it invited them to global leadership\nmeetings relatively early.\n\nAnother way to unlock value is to recommend mechanisms to help an individual\nbridge a gap or enhance her capacity. These might include moving her to a\ndifferent job, establishing a council to advise her, or assigning someone to\nhelp shore up a particular skill. For example, to build the technology\nexpertise of the small start-ups he funded, the famed venture capitalist John\nDoerr used his huge relationship network to connect the people running those\nbusinesses with top scientists at Bell Labs. In the same vein, CHROs could\nmake better use of their networks with other CHROs to connect people with\nothers who could build their capacity.\n\nCHROs should recommend ways to use human capital to unlock or create value.\n\nThe CHRO might also recommend splitting a division into subgroups to unleash\ngrowth and develop more P&L leaders. He might suggest particular skills to\nlook for when hiring a leader to run a country unit or big division. Other\nprescriptions might focus on improving the social engine\u2014the quality of\nrelationships, the level of trust and collaboration, and decisiveness. The\nCHRO could, for instance, work with business divisions to conduct reviews once\na month rather than annually, because reducing the time lag between actions\nand feedback increases motivation and improves operations.\n\n### What not to do.\n\nIn addition to spelling out clearly what is expected in the way of making\npredictions, diagnosing problems, and prescribing beneficial actions, the\nCHRO\u2019s new contract should define what she is _not_ required to do. This helps\nprovide focus and free time so that she can engage at a higher level. For\nexample, the transactional and administrative work of HR, including managing\nbenefits, could be cordoned off and reassigned, as some companies have begun\nto do. One option is to give those responsibilities to the CFO. At Netflix,\ntraditional HR processes and routines are organized under the finance\nfunction, while HR serves only as a talent scout and coach (see the \u201cFurther\nReading\u201d list). Another model we see emerging is to create a shared service\nfunction that combines the back-office activities of HR, finance, and IT. This\nfunction may or may not report to the CFO.\n\nCompensation has traditionally been the purview of CHROs, but it may be hard\nfor them to appreciate the specific issues business leaders face, just as it\nis hard for the CFO to understand the nuances of the social engine. Because\ncompensation has such an enormous impact on behavior and on the speed and\nagility of the corporation, the best solution is for the CEO and CFO to also\nget involved. While the CHRO can be the lead dog, compensation decisions\nshould be made jointly by the three\u2014and, given the increasingly active role of\ninstitutional investors, with the board\u2019s engagement.\n\n### The CHRO\u2019s fit.\n\nWith a new contract in hand, the chief executive should assess how well the\nCHRO meets the job specifications now and where he needs to be in three years.\nMost CHROs have come up through the HR pipeline. While some have had line\njobs, most have not; Korn Ferry research indicates that only 40 of the CHROs\nat Fortune 100 companies had significant work experience outside HR before\nthey came to lead that function. This might leave a gap in terms of\npredicting, diagnosing, and prescribing actions that will improve business\nperformance. However, inclusion in broader discussions will expand a CHRO\u2019s\nunderstanding of the business. CEOs should give their CHRO a chance to grow\ninto the newly defined role, and they should assess progress quarter by\nquarter.\n\nMeasuring the performance of the CHRO has long been problematic. HR leaders\nare usually judged on accomplishments such as installing a new process under\nbudget, recruiting a targeted number of people from the right places, or\nimproving retention or employee engagement. Yet such efforts are not directly\ntied to value creation. In keeping with recasting HR as a value creator rather\nthan a cost center, performance should be measured by outputs that are more\nclosely linked to revenue, profit margin, brand recognition, or market share.\nAnd the closer the linkage, the better.\n\nA CHRO can add value by, for example, moving a key person from one boss to\nanother and improving his performance; arranging for coaching that strengthens\na crucial skill; bringing a person from the outside into a pivotal position;\nputting two or three people together to create a new business or initiative to\ngrow the top or bottom line; reassigning a division manager because she will\nnot be able to meet the challenge two years out; or discovering and smoothing\nfriction where collaboration is required. Such actions are observable,\nverifiable, and closely related to the company\u2019s performance and numbers.\n\nHere\u2019s a case in point: When a promising young leader was put in charge of\nthree divisions of a large company, replacing an executive vice president with\nlong tenure, the divisions took off. The new EVP, who was growth-oriented and\ndigitally savvy, seized on commonalities among the three businesses in\ntechnology and production and nearly halved the product development cycle\ntime. In three years the divisions overtook the competition to become number\none.\n\n## Creating a G3\n\nTo make the CHRO a true partner, the CEO should create a triumvirate at the\ntop of the corporation that includes both the CFO and the CHRO. Forming such a\nteam is the single best way to link financial numbers with the people who\nproduce them. It also signals to the organization that you are lifting HR into\nthe inner sanctum and that the CHRO\u2019s contribution will be analogous to the\nCFO\u2019s. Although some companies may want the CHRO to be part of an expanded\ngroup that includes, say, a chief technology officer or chief risk officer,\nthe G3, as we call it, is the core group that should steer the company, and it\nshould meet apart from everyone else. The G3 will shape the destiny of the\nbusiness by looking forward and at the big picture while others bury their\nheads in operations, and it will ensure that the company stays on the rails by\nhoming in on any problems in execution. It is the G3 that makes the connection\nbetween the organization and business results.\n\nAt Marsh, a global leader in insurance brokerage and risk management, CEO\nPeter Zaffino often has one-on-one discussions with his CFO, Courtney\nLeimkuhler, and his CHRO, Mary Anne Elliott. In April 2015 he held a meeting\nwith both of them to assess the alignment of the organization with desired\nbusiness outcomes. The G3 began this meeting by selecting a business in the\nportfolio and drawing a vertical line down the middle of a blank page on a\nflip chart. The right side was for the business performance (Leimkuhler\u2019s\nexpertise); the left side for organizational design issues (Elliott\u2019s\nexpertise). A horizontal line created boxes for the answers to two simple\nquestions: What is going well? What is not going well?\n\nThe CEO should form a G3\u2014a core steering team\u2014with the CFO and the CHRO.\n\n\u201cPeter could have filled in the entire two-by-two chart on his own,\u201d Elliott\nsays, \u201cbut doing it together really added value.\u201d Zaffino adds, \u201cThe whole\nmeeting took about 15 minutes. We found the exercise to be very worthwhile. We\nalready run the business with disciplined processes. We conduct deep dives\ninto the organization\u2019s financial performance through quarterly operational\nreviews, and we conduct quarterly talent reviews, where we focus on the human\ncapital side. So you might not think we\u2019d want to introduce another process to\nevaluate how we are managing the business. But this G3 process provided us\nwith a terrific lens into the business without adding bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nWorking together to synthesize disparate data points into one flip chart\nhelped the team identify items on the organizational side that would predict\nbusiness performance in the next four to eight quarters. Significant value\ncame from the dialogue as connections emerged naturally. Zaffino says, \u201cWe\nconstantly drill down deep to understand why a business is performing the way\nit is. In those instances, we are drilling vertically, not horizontally, when\nthere could be some items identified on the organizational side that are\nactually driving the performance.\u201d Zaffino cited the implementation of a new\nsales plan, which HR was working on, as one example. His concern was making\nsure business results were aligned with remuneration \u201cso we didn\u2019t have sales\ncompensation becoming disconnected from the overall financial result of the\nbusiness,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe also didn\u2019t want to drive top-line growth without\nknowing how to invest back in the business and increase profitability.\u201d The\nCHRO was thinking it through from her perspective: Is this sales plan\nmotivating the right behaviors so that it moves business performance to the\n\u201cgoing well\u201d category?\n\nSeeing the interconnections also helped the trio identify what mattered most.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy enough to list everything we want to do better,\u201d Leimkuhler says,\n\u201cbut it\u2019s hard to know where to start. When you understand which things on the\norganizational side are really advancing business performance, it makes it\neasier to prioritize.\u201d For example, managing the transition of regional\nbusiness leaders was a big issue for HR\u2014one that, because of its difficulty,\nwould have been easy to push off. Seeing the extent to which inaction could be\nholding back business performance created a greater sense of urgency.\n\n\u201cIn the HR world, we talk about understanding and integrating with the\nbusiness,\u201d Elliott notes. \u201cG3 meetings are a pragmatic activity. When you\u2019re\nsitting with the CEO and CFO, there\u2019s no place for academic HR. It\u2019s all about\nunderstanding what the organization needs to do to drive business performance\nand how to align those key variables.\u201d\n\n#### This article also appears in:\n\n  * ![](/resources/images/article_assets/2016/11/10064E_500.png)\n\n###### [HBR\u2019s 10 Must Reads 2017](/product/hbr-s-10-must-reads-2017-the-\ndefinitive-management-ideas-of-the-year-from-harvard-business-\nreview/10064E-KND-ENG?referral=02559)\n\nLeadership & Managing People Book\n\n24.95 Add to Cart\n\n    * __Save\n    * __Share\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something to be said for peeling off into a smaller group,\u201d\nLeimkuhler adds. \u201cIt would be unwieldy to have this discussion with the full\nexecutive committee, which at Marsh consists of 10 executives. In any case,\nit\u2019s not one or the other; it\u2019s additive.\u201d Says Zaffino, \u201cThis was a\nstreamlined way to get a holistic view of the business. Each of us left the\nfirst G3 meeting feeling comfortable that the organization and the business\nwere aligned and that we have a very good handle on the business.\u201d\n\nVinod Kumar, CEO of Tata Communications, also uses an informal G3 mechanism.\nKumar\u2019s company supplies communication, computing, and collaboration\ninfrastructure to large global companies, including many telephone and mobile\noperators. In 2012 there were price drops of 15% to 20%, and disruptive\ntechnologies were par for the course. To keep pace, Tata Communications had to\ntransform its business very quickly, which meant building critical new\ncapabilities by hiring from the outside, at least in the short term\u2014an effort\nthat would hardly help the company deal with rising costs. Something had to\ngive, and Kumar enlisted then-CFO Sanjay Baweja and CHRO Aadesh Goyal to help\nchart a path forward while taking into account both financial and talent\nconsiderations.\n\nFrequent discussions among the G3 led to a consensus: Tata Communications\nwould restructure roles that had become redundant or were out of sync with the\ncompany\u2019s new direction, and it would move jobs to the right geographical\nlocations. These actions would reduce staffing costs by 7%. The company would\nuse the savings to build the necessary capabilities, mainly by making new\nhires, especially in sales, marketing, and technology.\n\nThe G3 next went to work on changes that would occur over a longer time. Tata\nCommunications launched a companywide program in late 2013 aimed at\ncontinuously improving productivity. The initial objective was to reduce the\ncost base by $100 million, but the overall intention was to seed a new\nculture. The G3 began by creating a cross-functional team that employees\njoined part-time. Ultimately more than 500 people participated, working on\nideas in 50 categories and achieving even more cost reductions than originally\ntargeted. In short, the project was a big success, and it continues to produce\nresults.\n\nDialogue\u2014both institutionalized and informal\u2014between the CHRO, the CFO, and\nthe CEO is now a way of life at Tata Communications. In time, as CHRO Goyal\u2019s\ngrasp of the business became evident, Kumar made a bold move: He gave Goyal\nthe additional responsibility of managing one of the company\u2019s high-growth\nsubsidiaries and made him part of the Innovation Council, which identifies\nopportunities to invest in and incubate new businesses.\n\n## Regular G3 Meetings\n\nIf a G3 is to be effective, the CEO has to ensure that the triumvirate meets\non a regular basis.\n\n### Weekly temperature taking.\n\nThe CEO, CFO, and CHRO should get together once a week to discuss any early\nwarning signals they are picking up internally or externally about the\ncondition of the social engine. Each of them will see things through a\ndifferent lens, and pooling their thoughts will yield a more accurate picture.\nThe three don\u2019t have to be together physically\u2014they can arrange a conference\ncall or video chat\u2014but meeting frequently is important. After about six weeks,\nand with discipline, such sessions could be finished in 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nThe CEO has to set the tone for these reviews, ensuring that the discussion is\nbalanced and that intellectual honesty and integrity are absolute. It\u2019s a\ngiven that both the CFO and the CHRO must be politically neutral to build\ntrust, and they must never sacrifice their integrity to be the CEO\u2019s henchmen.\nThey must be willing to speak up and tell it like it is. Over time, each G3\nmember will have a better understanding of the others\u2019 cognitive lenses,\ndiscussions will be more fluid, and all three will learn a lot about the\nintricacies of the business. They will also become more comfortable correcting\none another\u2019s biases, more skilled at reading people, and more likely to get\nthe right people in the right jobs.\n\n### Looking forward monthly.\n\nThe G3 should spend a couple of hours every month looking four and eight\nquarters ahead with these questions in mind: What people issues would prevent\nus from meeting our goals? Is there a problem with an individual? With\ncollaboration? Is a senior team member unable to see how the competition is\nmoving? Is somebody likely to leave us?\n\nCompanies do operational reviews, which are backward-looking, at least\nquarterly. The objective here is to be predictive and diagnostic, looking\nforward not just at the numbers but also at the people side, because most\nfailures and missed opportunities are people-related. There may be\norganizational issues, energy drains, or conflicts among silos, particularly\nin the top two layers. Conflicts are inherent in matrix organizations; the G3\nneeds to know where they exist, whether they could affect progress on a new\ninitiative, and how the leaders in charge are handling them. Probing such\nmatters is not micromanagement or a witch hunt. It\u2019s a means of finding the\nreal causes of both good and poor performance and taking corrective action\npromptly or preemptively.\n\n### Planning three years out.\n\nIt is common practice to plan where the company needs to be in three years and\nto decide what new projects to fund and where to invest capital. Often missing\nfrom that process is exploration of the people questions: Will we have\nemployees with the right skills, training, and temperament to achieve the\ntargets? Will our people have the flexibility to adapt to changing\ncircumstances? In most strategic planning, there is zero consideration of the\ncritical players in the organization\u2014or those working for competitors.\n\nDiscussion of people should come before discussion of strategy. (This is a\npractice that General Electric is known for.) What are employees\u2019\ncapabilities, what help might they need, and are they the very best? The CEO\nand the CHRO of one company decided that for every high-leverage position that\nopened, they should have five candidates\u2014three from inside, two from outside.\nTalent should always be viewed in a broad context. Consider who is excelling,\nbeing let go, or being lured away, along with any other information that could\naffect your competitiveness or your rivals\u2019.\n\n## New HR Leadership Channels\n\nSome CEOs might be holding back on elevating their CHROs because they lack\nconfidence in the HR leader\u2019s business judgment and people acumen. There\u2019s a\nfear that HR chiefs aren\u2019t prepared to discuss issues beyond hiring, firing,\npayroll, benefits, and the like. That reservation must be met head-on by\nproviding rich opportunities for CHROs to learn. Give them more exposure to\nthe business side through meetings of the G3, and provide some coaching. If\nknowledge or skills gaps persist, ask the CHRO how she might fill them. Some\nCHROs will rise to the occasion. Others won\u2019t measure up, and the supply of\nsuitable replacements might be scarce at first. (The same issue applied in the\n1980s to finding the right CFO types from the ranks of accounting.)\n\nAn enduring solution is to create new career paths for HR leaders to cultivate\nbusiness smarts and for business leaders to cultivate people smarts. Every\nentry-level leader, whether in HR or some other job, should get rigorous\ntraining in judging, recruiting, and coaching people. And those who begin\ntheir careers in HR leadership should go through rigorous training in business\nanalysis, along the lines of what McKinsey requires for all its new recruits.\nThere should be no straight-line leadership promotions up the functional HR\nsilo. Aspiring CHROs should have line jobs along the way, where they have to\nmanage people and budgets.\n\nAll leaders headed for top jobs should alternate between positions in HR and\nin the rest of the business. Make it a requirement for people in the top three\nlayers of the company to have successfully worked as an HR leader, and the\nfunction will soon become a talent magnet. Be sure that it isn\u2019t just ticket\npunching. Those who have no feel for the people side are unlikely to succeed\nfor long in high-level jobs.\n\n## The Transition to the New HR\n\nAny CEO who is sold on the idea that people are the ultimate source of\nsustainable competitive differentiation must take the rejuvenation and\nelevation of the HR function very seriously. Creating a mechanism that knits\nthe CFO and the CHRO together will improve the business and expand the CEO\u2019s\npersonal capability. It won\u2019t happen overnight\u2014three years seems to us the\nminimum time required to achieve a shift of this magnitude. Stating the new\nexpectations for the CHRO and the human resources function is a good place to\nbegin. Creating ways to blend business and people acumen should follow. And\nredesigning career tracks and talent reviews will take the company further\nstill. But none of this will happen unless the CEO personally embraces the\nchallenge, makes a three-year commitment, and starts executing.\n\nA version of this article appeared in the [July\u2013August 2015](/archive-\ntoc/BR1507) issue (pp.62-71) of _Harvard Business Review_.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/02/110-Ram-Charan.jpg)\n\n[Ram Charan](/search?term=ram%20charan&search_type=search-all) has been an\nadviser to the CEOs of some of the world's biggest corporations and their\nboards.

Until recently, the typical profile involved an\neducation in one of the social sciences or humanities, a career trajectory\nanchored in the HR function and first-hand experience in several major\norganisational transformation projects. These are all still useful, of course.\nHowever, what\u2019s new and invaluable appears to be the ability to understand how\nbig data and algorithms can be used to re-design organisations.\n\nOrganisation design has always been about creating a pattern of interactions\namong a group of members that help accomplish the organisation\u2019s goals. What\nhas changed is the availability of fine-grained data about these interactions,\nand the computational power to analyse them. Consequently, we also need new\nways to think about organisation design that link individual actions and\ninteractions to organisational outcomes.\n\nMy new book for researchers, [**_The Microstructure of\nOrganisations_**](https://www.amazon.com/Microstructure-Organizations-Phanish-\nPuranam/dp/0199672377/), outlines one such perspective that my collaborators,\nstudents and I have been working on for a decade now. But I want to focus here\non the practical implications, and in particular on how we can make\norganisation development professionals more sophisticated about the use of\nalgorithms.\n\n**Perception, prediction and prototyping**\n\nMy collaborator **[Julien Cl\u00e9ment](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-\nresearch/faculty/julien-clement)** and I have developed a simple \u201cladder of\nsophistication\u201d to systematize our thinking about how algorithms can aid in\norganisation design.\n\nThe first and most basic step in deploying data is _perception_ \u2013 using and\nanalysing existing data and algorithms to better understand how an\norganisation works. Simple descriptive statistics and hypothesis tests can\nilluminate the true nature of a problem, or bring to light problems you were\nunaware of.\n\nData can also fuel _prediction._ Applied to descriptive data sets, machine\nlearning can produce best guesses about the future, such as which employees\nare likely to quit, the probable performance of a team and the likelihood of\nsuccess for a given employee.\n\nThe third, most advanced step is also the most potentially valuable. Borrowing\na concept from product development, organisation designers can engage in rapid\n_prototyping_ , i.e. trying out bold, even radical configurations, and scaling\nup the successful ones where appropriate.\n\nFor example, companies often change seating arrangements to encourage (or\ndiscourage) certain types of interactions between employees. But uprooting\npeople carries the risk of severing fruitful network ties. Will the change be\nworth it? Similar questions can arise about **[Agile management\npractices](https://knowledge.insead.edu/blog/insead-blog/why-agile-may-be-\nfragile-10201)** , skip-level reporting or crowdsourcing.\n\nThere are two main types of experiments we can use in prototyping. Ideally, we\nwould use both in a two-pronged attack on the problem.\n\nThe least speculative but most expensive type is a field experiment, or\nrandomised controlled trial. A cheaper version of this experiment could be\nconducted in a behavioural laboratory or under laboratory-like isolation from\nthe normal work environment (e.g. through gamification).\n\nAn alternative way to experiment is to build agent-based computational models\nbased on actual organisational data. This allows designers to simulate\nproposed changes and gauge predicted consequences at relatively low cost.\n\n**What organisation designers need to know**\n\nDoes adopting these new techniques require a deep knowledge of computational\ntechniques and algorithms? Not really. But it does require what we call\n\u201cfunctional understanding\u201d \u2013 an understanding of what algorithms can and\ncannot do, as well as a general sense of how they do it. This, we have\ndiscovered, can be conveyed quite rapidly **[even to those who have neither\nprior background nor knowledge](https://knowledge.insead.edu/blog/insead-\nblog/organisation-design-based-on-science-not-superstition-6531)**. One thing\ndoes seem very clear: To remain effective in the years to come, organisation\ndesign professionals will need to get up to speed with how to use algorithms.\n\n**_[Phanish Puranam](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/phanish-\npuranam)_** _is an INSEAD Professor of Strategy and the Roland Berger Chaired\nProfessor of Strategy and Organisation Design._\n\n_Follow INSEAD Knowledge on_ **\n_[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/inseadknowledge)_** _and_ **\n_[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/Knowledge.insead)_** _._\n\nRelated articles\n\n  * ![](https://knowledge.insead.edu/sites/www.insead.edu/files/styles/80x100/public/styles/panoramic/public/images/2019/02/talking_the_talk_change_culture.jpg?itok=DZPGA4sw)\n\n[When Talking the Talk Is Enough to Change Culture](/leadership-\norganisations/when-talking-the-talk-is-enough-to-change-culture-11091)\n\nMarch 4, 2019\n\n  * ![](https://knowledge.insead.edu/sites/www.insead.edu/files/styles/80x100/public/styles/panoramic/public/images/2019/01/gettyimages-940875572.jpg?itok=zZS-yCmF)\n\n[The World\u2019s Most Talent Competitive Countries, 2019](/career/the-worlds-most-\ntalent-competitive-countries-2019-10811)\n\nJanuary 21, 2019\n\n  * ![](https://knowledge.insead.edu/sites/www.insead.edu/files/styles/80x100/public/styles/panoramic/public/images/2018/09/is_it_time_to_retire_the_org_chart_2.jpg?itok=HJSmya9c)\n\n[Is It Time to Retire the Org Chart?](/leadership-organisations/is-it-time-to-\nretire-the-org-chart-10151)\n\nSeptember 27, 2018\n\nComments\n\nRavindra Purohit , 13.11.2018 at 06.34 pm\n\n[Organization Design ](/leadership-organisations/re-designing-organisations-\nin-the-age-of-algorithms-10426#comment-18466)\n\nGreat content,  \n  \nI just thought of adding here the productivity quotient of the employees or\nworkforce.

__![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-\norganization-chart-1551382934.jpg?size=1000x)\n](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-organization-\nchart-1551382934.jpg?size=1000x1000)\n\n\u201cHave you ever seen \u2018Job Shop Management 101\u2019 taught in any college or\nuniversity? I\u2019m betting not.\u201d\n\nSo said Vincent Bozzone, president and founder of Delta Dynamics, a Michigan-\nbased consultancy long known to many in the job shop world. Bozzone is the\nauthor of Speed to Market: Lean Manufacturing for Job Shops, a book focused on\nrefining job shop operations to shorten lead time, the order-to-cash cycle.\nStill, Bozzone conceded that this and his other previously published works\nhaven\u2019t delved deeply into the job shop management structure.\n\n\u201cThere is no \u2018theory of job shops,\u2019\u201d Bozzone continued, adding that no one in\nacademia or much of the management consulting world really has dissected the\njob shop business model in a serious way.\n\nWhen you think about just how complex custom fabrication job shops truly are,\nit\u2019s no wonder that many of them struggle with on-time delivery. For years the\nannual \u201cFinancial Ratios & Operational Benchmarking Survey\u201d from the\nFabricators & Manufacturers Association has reported on-time delivery rates in\nthe mid-80 percent range. Sure, the annually reported average comes from a\nwide range of responses, and many fabricators do achieve near-perfect on-time\ndelivery rates. But just as many report rates at or below average.\n\nMany job shops grow into organizations that ship hundreds or thousands of\ndifferent parts over a month or year, each with their own demand cycles,\nroutings, and engineering and manufacturing requirements. It all creates a web\nof complexity\u2014but why, exactly? Bozzone attributes at least some of that\ncomplexity to the way most job shops are organized: around function instead of\nthe business process.\n\nSwitching to a process-based organization could be a good first step in real\nchange. Changing the organization chart won\u2019t eliminate all problems, Bozzone\nsaid, but it could help, rather than hinder, the flow of jobs through the\nbusiness.\n\n## A Job Shop Growth Story\n\nAccording to Bozzone, having an organization chart grouped by function is\nwhere those dreaded communication \u201csilos\u201d come from. Say a cutting department\nmanager has a question about material purchasing practices, considering the\nissues he\u2019s experienced on the cutting table. Strictly speaking, the\norganization chart says that he should speak to his supervisor, who then\nshould speak to the manufacturing manager, who then should speak to the\npresident. The president then talks to the purchasing manager (who, again,\nreports to the president, not manufacturing).\n\nCommunications might not be this formal, of course, particularly in the fast-\npaced job shop world. It doesn\u2019t make sense for every tiny purchasing issue to\nbe brought to the president\u2019s attention, though major purchasing issues would\nbe.\n\nOf course, the real issue is that the cutting problem occurred during\nproduction, and it\u2019s creating a speed bump. Flow stops, other jobs are\ndelayed, and the dominoes fall.\n\nTo avoid these problems, many have trumpeted the benefits of \u201cbreaking down\nthe silos.\u201d Managers promote good communications, hold meetings to keep\neveryone in the loop, and more.\n\n[ __![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-\norganization-chart-1551382939.jpg?size=1000x)\n](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-organization-\nchart-1551382939.jpg?size=1000x1000)\n\nThe job shop business process cycle starts with marketing and sales and ends\nwith shipping and receiving payment for a job.\n\nBut Bozzone\u2019s approach goes deeper and tackles the root cause: the\norganization structure itself. What\u2019s wrong with it? As Bozzone explained, it\ndoesn\u2019t consider the actual business processes that define how a job shop\nactually works.\n\nWhat are those business processes? Bozzone illustrates them in a cycle,\nstarting with marketing and sales. \u201cMarketing and sales generate a request for\nquotations, which are estimated and bid upon. The shop either wins them or\nloses them. Typically, you lose a lot more than you win.\u201d\n\nOnce a job is won, some level of engineering can be involved,\u201canything from a\ncouple of sketches to a full-blown engineering design effort.\u201d Next comes\npreproduction, which prepares the job for production (more on this later);\nproduction; and finally shipping.\n\n## The Three Functions of the Order Cycle\n\nThe whole quote-to-cash cycle really can be grouped into three basic\nfunctions: selling and bidding, preparing the won orders for production, and\nproducing and shipping those orders. Bozzone calls these the front end,\npreproduction, and production, respectively. Supporting these three functions\nis an area Bozzone calls \u201cmanagement information, which incorporates finance,\nhuman resources, IT, and office operations.\u201d\n\nIn the early stages of a job shop\u2019s life, one person does the first three and\nat least some of the fourth (though functions like continuous improvement\nwouldn\u2019t be formalized). Then the founder might hire someone\u2014a sheet metal\nguru\u2014to prepare jobs, do a little engineering, and run the machines\n(preproduction and production), but the founder still sells and bids on work\nand manages material purchases (front end), building those customer and\nsupplier relationships that help the business grow.\n\nBut then the order volume grows, and the founder hires more and more people.\nOrders get more complicated, and the number of orders and machines grows. The\nshop hires engineers, estimators, and operators. Before you know it, the shop\nhas a traditional functional structure\u2014which, you might notice, has something\nmissing.\n\n## The Need for Preproduction\n\n\u201cMy bet is that most custom fab shops don\u2019t have a designated preproduction\ndepartment,\u201d Bozzone said, \u201cor even a way to control preproduction activities.\nInstead, the various preproduction tasks are scattered around the\norganization. This is a prime reason for long lead times.\u201d\n\nPreproduction\u2014that process the technical guru took care of on his own when the\nshop was young\u2014eventually becomes diluted. Engineers do a little preproduction\nwork, prepping the CAD drawing so the part can be manufactured on the floor.\nSchedulers might put together a routing through certain machines to take\nadvantage of available capacity.\n\nBut then parts are released to the floor, where the holdups inevitably\nsurface: a press brake setup that just doesn\u2019t work, a weld fixture that\nhasn\u2019t been made, a powder coat that just won\u2019t stick.\n\nSome large fabricators designate a department for prototyping, one-offs, and\nlow-volume nonrepeating work, where engineers and highly skilled machine\noperators and welders work together to make first articles and prepare a job.\nBut the vast majority of shops do not have such a department, and a good many\nsmaller operations don\u2019t have the machines to spare.\n\n[ __![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-\norganization-chart-1551382944.jpg?size=1000x)\n](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-organization-\nchart-1551382944.jpg?size=1000x1000)\n\nAccording to Vincent Bozzone, a traditional functional structure does not\nalign with a job shop\u2019s business processes.\n\nBozzone\u2019s \u201cpreproduction\u201d concept focuses less on part design, which\u2014besides\ndesign tweaks for manufacturability\u2014is usually outside the job shop\u2019s sandbox.\nIt instead takes a broader approach and focuses on developing a production\nplan that includes purchasing and capacity planning, scheduling, programming,\nquality protocols, customer approvals, and developing necessary fixtures and\ntooling setups as well as effective routings. The idea is to make production\nas smooth as it can be.\n\nHe added that, yes, if a job shop needs to develop first articles and test\nparts, it\u2019s ideal for a designated preproduction department to have its own\nmachines, but it\u2019s not entirely needed as long as machine time for\npreproduction is made available in the shop.\n\nAnd preproduction doesn\u2019t necessarily need to make first articles. In fact,\nfor some job shop businesses, a first article would be impractical. Bozzone\ndescribed Max Weiss Co., a job shop in Milwaukee he recently visited. The\ncompany bends and rolls massive beams, pipes, and angle for the construction\nbusiness and OEMs.\n\nRolling cycle time is measured in hours, and one massive piece can cost\nserious money. In this case, he said, preproduction would entail the engineers\nand tooling professionals working together to ensure production goes smoothly,\nthat the first roll goes as quickly and predictably as possible.\n\nBut again, many organization charts place preproduction roles in various\nareas. Purchasing and programming might be in the front office and report to\ntop management. A quality assurance department could devote some of its time\nto preproduction (quality protocols), and some of its time to production,\nchecking production parts to meet customer quality requirements.\n\nA lead operator in the press brake department plays a preproduction role too,\nsetting up jobs to make sure they run correctly. Only he or she is probably\ndoing it after the job has been released to production. If that lead person\nruns into trouble developing a setup and spends hours trying to perfect it,\nthe brake department just lost available capacity for other jobs.\n\n## Align Structure With Process\n\nYes, fabricators could work on developing communication among departments and\nfoster an environment that encourages ownership over the quality of one\u2019s\nwork. Problem is, a job shop\u2019s organizational structure often works against\nthis.\n\nBozzone\u2019s proposed job shop structure aligns with the job shop business\nprocess. A shop could have vice presidents over the front-end processes,\npreproduction, and production, and then organize the related functions\nunderneath.\n\nThe preproduction department could include engineering (which could include\nphysical tryouts of difficult parts), production planning and scheduling,\nmaterials and production scheduling, quality protocols establishment, and\ntraveler release, at which point the baton is handed off to the production\ndepartment.\n\nWhat about support functions like QA, manufacturing support, and maintenance?\nThe exact organization depends on a job shop\u2019s niche and product mix, Bozzone\nsaid; but wherever these support functions are placed, they should support,\nand not work against, the job shop business process.\n\n[ __![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-\norganization-chart-1551382950.jpg?size=1000x)\n](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-organization-\nchart-1551382950.jpg?size=1000x1000)\n\nBozzone proposes a new job shop structure, with front-end, preproduction, and\nproduction departments that align with the shop\u2019s business processes. A\nseparate administration, or \u201cmanagement information,\u201d department\u2014for functions\nlike HR, finance, and IT\u2014would also report to the president. The red text in\nthe bottom chart indicates key metrics.\n\nFor example, some QA techs could be under production, ensuring inspections are\nmade and documented per customer requirements and reporting to the VP of\nproduction. The preproduction department also could employ quality experts who\ndevelop the quality protocols for each job.\n\nA similar arrangement could be made for maintenance functions. Most\nmaintenance personnel would support production and, hence, report to the VP of\nproduction. Meanwhile, if preproduction has separate equipment for job\ntryouts, technicians within the preproduction department could be responsible\nfor their own machine maintenance.\n\nStill, Bozzone emphasized that such divisions should never foster \u201cnot my job\u201d\nmentalities. If a maintenance expert in production knows best how to fix a\npress brake in the preproduction area, he should fix the machine. And he\nshould have the incentive to do so, because the better preproduction does its\njob, the easier production\u2019s job becomes. All this, Bozzone explained, is\nwhere performance metrics come into play.\n\n## The Right Metrics\n\nMetrics and performance reviews would be based on satisfying demand for the\nnext customer in the value chain. That is, they help make life easier for\nthose downstream. This builds the foundation for cross-company communication\nand collaboration. Knowledge is shared. Decision-making occurs quickly.\nProduction gives feedback to preproduction, which gives feedback to the front\nend. If you aren\u2019t giving your customer (internal or external) what he or she\nneeds, your performance suffers.\n\nThose in the production department would be measured based on how well they\nmeet the end customer\u2019s demand. Are deliveries of quality parts made quickly,\nwithin the expected time? Are the dimensions and quantities correct?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an old job shop adage,\u201d Bozzone said. \u201c\u2018The longer a job sits on the\nfloor, the more it costs to get it out the door.\u2019\u201d\n\nProduction performance metrics might include percentage of jobs that need\nrework, along with other productivity metrics like dollars shipped per hours\nworked.\n\n\u201cRework is an important metric because it is the most expensive source of\nwaste in any job shop,\u201d Bozzone said. \u201cLook at it this way: First you pay to\nmake it wrong; then you pay to undo what has been made wrong; then you pay\nagain to redo what has been undone; and all the time you are undoing and\nredoing, you have lost capacity that could have been sold. Then you add the\ncost of scrap.\u201d (It\u2019s little wonder Bozzone calls rework \u201cthe Great Satan of\nWaste.\u201d)\n\nPreproduction metrics might include the percentage of shop orders released on\ntime and complete\u2014that is, orders that reach production without anything\nmissing: material, tooling and fixturing, clear and comprehensive setup\ninstructions, and more. The last thing production wants is for preproduction\nto miss something that causes problems in production.\n\n\u201cFor preproduction, releasing orders on time is equally important,\u201d Bozzone\nadded, \u201cbecause when preproduction is delayed and an order is released to the\nshop late, this overloads the shop, creates chaos, and leads to late\ndeliveries. In fact, [late deliveries from production] are often assumed to be\na scheduling problem, when in fact they are not.\u201d\n\n[ __![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-\norganization-chart-1551382955.jpg?size=1000x)\n](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-organization-\nchart-1551382955.jpg?size=1000x1000)\n\nThe \u201cfront end\u201d would include marketing, sales, estimating, and, in those\nshops with an extended build cycle, project management.\n\nSimilarly, the front end should work to make life easier for preproduction.\nThe faster and more smoothly preproduction can work through job orders, the\nbetter the front end is performing. Sales focuses on the shop\u2019s sweet spot,\nwhere it can be the most competitive, while perhaps, in an effort to diversify\nthe customer base, exploring how that sweet spot could help customers in other\nmarket sectors.\n\n\u201cA danger in job shops is taking orders that do not fit the shop\u2019s\ncapabilities or cannot be delivered by the promised date,\u201d Bozzone said. These\nshould not be quoted, which is difficult to do when the shop is low on work.\n\nWith sales focusing on the shop\u2019s strengths, estimators work with drawings\nthat show parts they know the shop can produce; if they don\u2019t know, or if they\nknow the job might be pushing the envelope for production, they talk with\ntheir internal customers\u2014that is, the experts in preproduction\u2014and work toward\na solution.\n\nKey front-end metrics could include the number of leads generated (including\nrequests for quotation), the percentage of leads that turn into orders and\nbooked business, and the number of new customers.\n\n\u201cNew customers are absolutely critical for job shops,\u201d Bozzone said, \u201cbecause\nthe customer base is continually eroding.\u201d\n\nNote a key metric that hasn\u2019t been mentioned: on-time and on-budget delivery.\nAs Bozzone explained, this is a critical metric for the entire organization,\nbut it cannot be looked at in a vacuum. A job could have flown through\nproduction but still be shipped late, just because it was held up in\npreproduction or front-end processes. So when it comes to performance metrics,\nthe buck for on-time delivery stops not in manufacturing, not in engineering\nor sales, but at the president or chief executive\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the president\u2019s job to build an organization that can in fact deliver\nconsistently on time and on budget,\u201d Bozzone said.\n\n## Big-picture Thinking\n\nThis new structure, Bozzone said, gets people away from compartmentalized\nthinking. \u201cIn a functional arrangement, people tend to think about their\nfunction and not how it fits into the overall business process.\u201d\n\nThis new organizational model could change that. Bozzone conceded that\nchanging the organization structure alone won\u2019t make every problem go away.\nBut at least it would align everyone\u2019s job with the job shop business process\nand set the stage for future growth.\n\n_Delta Dynamics\nInc.,[www.deltadynamicsinc.com](http://www.deltadynamicsinc.com),\n[jobshop360.com](http://jobshop360.com)._\n\n__ ![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/a/a-new-look-at-the-job-shop-\norganization-chart-1551382960.jpg?size=1000x)\n\nKey metrics for individual departments should support key metrics for the\noverall organization, the most important being delivering on time and on\nbudget (within the estimate).\n\n##### About the Author\n\n### Tim Heston\n\nSenior Editor\n\nFMA Communications Inc.\n\n__\n\n2135 Point Blvd\n\nElgin,  IL 60123\n\n__\n\n815-381-1314\n\n__\n\n[Email Tim Heston](mailto:timh@thefabricator.com \"Tim Heston\")\n\n__\n\n[See More by Tim Heston](/author/tim-heston)\n\n##### About the Publication\n\n[ ![The FABRICATOR](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/pub/thumbs/200/JPEG/fab-\nmarch-2019-1551111627.jpg) ](/thefabricator/about \"About The FABRICATOR\")\n\n[ ![The FABRICATOR](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/logos/logo_the-\nfabricator.svg) ](/thefabricator/about \"About The FABRICATOR\")\n\n__\n\n[Read more from this issue](/thefabricator/issues/fab-march-2019 \"Read more\nfrom this issue\")\n\n__\n\n[View the Digital Edition](/thefabricator/digitaledition \"View the digital\nedition of The FABRICATOR\")\n\n__\n\n[Subscribe to The FABRICATOR](/subscription/pub/fab \"Subscribe to The\nFABRICATOR\")\n\n__\n\n[Find The FABRICATOR on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thefabricator/\n\"Find The FABRICATOR on Facebook\")\n\n__\n\n[Find The FABRICATOR on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fabricating \"Find The\nFABRICATOR on Twitter\")\n\n##### You May Also Like\n\n[ ](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/a-new-business-model-a-new-\nstructure-a-new-business)\n\n#### [A new business model, a new structure\u2014a new\nbusiness](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/a-new-business-model-a-new-\nstructure-a-new-business)\n\n[ ](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/job-shop-management-are-scheduling-\nproblems-really-symptoms)\n\n#### [Job shop management: Are scheduling problems really\nsymptoms?](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/job-shop-management-are-\nscheduling-problems-really-symptoms)\n\n[ ](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/how-to-track-success-in-the-job-\nshop)\n\n#### [How to track success in the job\nshop](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/how-to-track-success-in-the-job-\nshop)\n\n[ ](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/structurally-its-a-job-shop)\n\n#### [Structurally, it's a job\nshop](/thefabricator/article/shopmanagement/structurally-its-a-job-shop)\n\n#### Get The FABRICATOR updates in your inbox\n\nSign up and be the first to know about the latest industry news, products, and\nevents!\n\nSubscribe\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n  * __\n  * Stay connected from anywhere\n\n  * The FABRICATOR\n  * The Welder\n  * The Tube and Pipe Journal\n  * STAMPING Journal\n  * The Additive Report\n\n[![](https://cdn.thefabricator.com/pub/thumbs/200/JPEG/fab-\napril-2020-1584633775.jpg)](/thefabricator/digitaledition \"View the Digital\nEdition of The FABRICATOR\")\n\nNow through June 1, we\u2019re providing full access to the digital edition of _The\nFABRICATOR_.

This is followed by biotech startup RWDC,\nwhich raised $17.6m (US$13m) and $29.8m (US$22m) last October 2018 and April\n2019, respectively, as well as artificial intelligence (AI) solutions provider\nAnyMind, which bagged $21.4m in March.\n\nDeeptech startups covering AI, biotech, healthtech, and Internet of Things\n(IoT) also dominated the list. Other startups that joined the ranks are\nRedDoorz ($14.9m or US$11m), Holmusk ($13.2m or US$9.75m), umitron ($11.1m or\nUS$8.2m and $2.7m or US$2m), Oxfordcaps ($10.8m or US$8m), Silot ($10.8m or\nUS$8m), Beam ($8.7m or US$6.4m), and KaHa ($8.4m or US$6.2m). Overall, the 20\nhottest startups collected an average of about $14.9m (US$11m) in funding,\nwhich skyrocketed by 184.9% from the average funding last year at $5.23m.\n\nAccording to e27's Southeast Asia Startup Ecosystem report, startups in\nSingapore hauled US$7.5b via funding in 2018 after seeing 189 deals. Companies\nwere included on the list based on funding size followed by channel checks\nwith leading venture capital firms to ensure they were indeed hot enough.\nWhilst not an exhaustive compendium, the list does provide a good flavour of\nthe types of firms being funded in Singapore.\n\nOther notable startups that people are talking about include the fintechs\nRate, SpherePay, Finaxar, Xen.net and Vouch Insurtech, as well as card\npayments platform CardUp, influencer marketing platform Affable, machine\nlearning engine Anapi, HRtech firm Snaphunt, software firm Horangi, healthtech\nstartup botMD, and business travel platform TravelStop.\n\n**Ramesh Raghavan** , vice chairman of Business Angel Network of Southeast\nAsia (BANSEA), concurred and said that healthcare startups show a huge\nopportunity.\n\nAside from these verticals, there are other sectors which VCs think are\nunderserved. Soh said that there is an upcoming focus in the insurtech area,\nwhich is usually classified together with fintech. \"I would like to see more\nfunding go to startups centred on healthtech, food, agritech, and hardware,\"\nhe said.\n\nGolden Gate Ventures principal **Justin Hall** cited that the logistics\nvertical also has \"enormous potential,\" due to the confluence of increasing\ncommercial activity across the region, amount of investment required to\nimprove and digitise existing logistics solutions, as well as the amount of\ninstitutional capital still pouring into the Southeast Asian ecosystem.\n\n**Russ Neu** , venture partner for impact at Quest Ventures, said that their\nfirm has been tracking and investing in childtech startups, even when the\nvertical is below the radar of investors.\n\nHowever, Raghavan noted that fintech still remains a huge focus for\nSingaporean investors, as expected from a financial hub. e27's report revealed\nthat of the 189 funding rounds conducted in 2018, fintech accounted for 62 of\nit, or 32.8%, making it the core driver in Singapore.\n\n**Fintech still in focus**  \n\"I don't think VCs are biased to fintechs. It's just that financial inclusion\nis one of the biggest opportunities in Asia and a massive addressable market\nand anything that solves friction in this space is an exit opportunity in the\nlong term,\" Raghavan commented.\n\nNeu also said that VCs are not always keen to tap into this sector. \"Different\nVCs have different mandates so whilst there are VCs that specialise in\nfintech, there are certainly VCs who avoid this sector,\" Neu said.\n\nFurthermore, the continued focus on fintech firms is being driven by\ngovernment support. In particular, SGInnovate launched a financing scheme that\nwill invest up to $80m over four years into tech-related verticals, in\npartnership with co-investment partners such as Golden Gate Ventures, Monk's\nHill Ventures, and Wavemaker Partners. The Monetary Authority of Singapore\n(MAS) also granted five virtual bank licenses to non-banks.\n\n**Growing funding gap**  \nDespite the rising numbers of startups and sizes of their financing rounds,\nNeu stated that Singapore has a funding gap beyond series B rounds. \"In 2018,\nthere were people complaining about a seed funding gap as most of the seed\ninvestors have moved a stage later to look at Series A and B investments, but\nnow there are new funds coming into the seed stage space such as Sequoia,\nwhich is investing in many seed stage companies at one go,\" said  **Wayne\nSoh** , investment director for Singapore/APAC at Plug and Play Tech Center.\n\n\n\n**Hottest Startups 2019**\n\n![](/sites/default/files/misc/1 CARRO.JPG)\n\n**1.Carro**\n\n**Founder(s):** Aaron Tan  \n**Funding:** Carro bagged $81.3m through a series A funding round last June\n2018. It was led by SoftBank Ventures, Insignia Ventures Partners and B\nCapital Group.  \n**Start of operations:** 2015\n\nCarro is an online platform for buying and selling cars. It uses a proprietary\npricing algorithm to determine prices. Apart from being an automotive\nmarketplace, it also offers in-house repairs and maintenance, roadside\nassistance services, as well as after-sales services such as a warranty that\ncovers direct owner purchases.

Driven by needs that are\nsometimes not provided by a permanent placement, for example, flexible working\narrangements or gaining experience without a need to commit to a company, more\npeople today seek greater control over the way they work.\n\nAs a result, the contingent workforce or gig economy is accelerating. In\nSingapore, 82% of free agents do so by choice, a much higher proportion\nrelative to other developed countries such as Sweden, Spain and the United\nKingdom. Globally, 64% of free agents choose to join the contingent workforce\nbecause it allows them the ability to organise their job around their lives.\n\nAt the same time, especially in the last few years, we have seen more\ncompanies in Singapore and the Asia Pacific increase hiring of this workforce;\nin fact, the region is home to the largest percentage of contingent workers in\nthe world, at 34%. To give some perspective, there are about 50 million free\nagents in the United States alone, comprising 33% of the country's workforce.\n\nWhat is allowing this phenomenon to take place is in a way, a meeting of\nneeds: Workers now want more control of their work experiences, whilst\ncompanies are constantly refining hiring policies, even automating work to\nstem rising labour costs, or to fill a skills gap that may not typically be\navailable in the permanent workforce.\n\nIn the Asian context, this is a really big shift from the long-held belief\nthat a job is for life. So what has caused workers in Singapore and Asia\nPacific to have this shift, and to embrace contingent working over permanent\njobs?\n\n**Embracing the gig economy lifestyle**  \nToday, many workers have chosen the gig economy career. For them, it is no\nlonger a career path taken out of hardship, but a decision they have made for\nthemselves with confidence, for a deliberate choice. This can be attributed to\nseveral reasons.\n\nFirstly, the tenures of contingent and permanent workers are equalising. There\nis very little difference today in how long individuals stay at a company.\nAccording to our survey with C-suite executives in Asia Pacific, average\ntenures of permanent workers are getting shorter, with half of an\norganisation's workforce in Singapore leaving within three years. With this,\none can gather that contingent workers and companies now view that contingent\nwork is just as stable as permanent work.\n\nSecondly, there is a shift in the thinking that contingent talent is valuable\nonly for administrative and support functions, or limited to certain\nprofessions such as insurance agents, or freelance designers. A sizeable\nproportion of contingent openings are for senior leadership positions. C-suite\nleaders in Asia Pacific report that nearly half of the contingent workers\nhired were for mid-and-senior level positions. Singapore sees the highest\nexpected growth in this area compared with other Asian markets, with 34% of\ncontingent workers in senior level positions.\n\nThirdly, contingent work is skilled work. More than half the organisations in\nAsia Pacific surveyed said that they hire contingent workers to fill skill\nrequirements that are typically not available in the permanent workforce. This\nmeans that contingent workers today not only have the option of getting\nquality jobs, they also have greater control and ownership over how they\nintegrate work with their personal lives and passions.\n\n**Contingent working is the new normal**  \nOur survey also revealed that one in four C-suite leaders reported that\ncontingent workers make up more than 30% of their overall workforce- a 13%\nincrease from the previous year.\n\nMoreover, contingent workers surveyed said that they are happy with their work\narrangements, with 64% said to be satisfied with their current employment\nsituation overall, and 63% satisfied with their work-life balance. 61% also\nreported seeing contingent working as a lifetime commitment.\n\nIt is obvious that individuals working as free agents or independent\ncontractors, feel liberated from conventional thinking around permanent\nplacements, and now enjoy not being limited to one employer and can pick and\nchoose their projects, gaining a more comprehensive experience along the way\nfrom assignments in different companies and sectors.\n\nIndeed, independence, flexibility and growth opportunities offered in\ncontingent working can lead to a successful and fulfilling career.\n\n**_The views expressed in this column are the author 's own and do not\nnecessarily reflect this publication's view, and this article is not edited by\nSingapore Business Review.

Organizational design (OD) focuses on identifying and creating the\nright human structure within the organization and identifying the right\ncompetencies, knowledge, skills, abilities and other characteristics required\nin each part of that design. Although it can be difficult to find and hire\ntalent, it can be an even greater challenge to build an organizational\nstructure that will ensure that people with the right skills and competencies\nare working in the right jobs and teams now and in the future.\n\n**HR\u2019s Role in OD and the Challenges**\n\nMany challenges exist regarding HR\u2019s role in organizational design. Owning a\nsignificant organizational design effort from creation to implementation takes\na lot of time, and most HR departments don\u2019t have the resources to commit to\nthis. Additionally, many HR departments lack the expertise necessary to build\nan organizational design plan. In the _SHRM Online_ article [Research: It\u2019s\nNot a Four-Letter Word](https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/organizational-and-employee-development/Pages/Research-in-HR.aspx),\nSHRM Director of HR Competencies Joe Jones points out, \u201cHR is no longer a\nsimple art form. It is more science than art, rooted in well-planned, well-\nexecuted and actionable HR research that results in an improved organization,\nnot a dusty report on a shelf that no one reads.\u201d\n\n**An Ongoing Effort**\n\nConducting a critical evaluation of how your organization is structured is not\nsomething that should be undertaken every five years. Organizational design\nmust become an ongoing initiative and a core HR function. In the blog post\n[Data Driven Organization Design](http://blog.shrm.org/blog/data-driven-\norganization-design-q-a-with-rupert-morrison)\u2014Q&A, Concentra CEO Rupert\nMorrison says that \u201cThe modern day organization is under increasing pressure\nto adapt quickly to changing markets and disruptive organizational events such\nas mergers and restructures as well as changes in working habits with\ndigitally engaged, mobile workforces. This means people need to shift their\nperspective from seeing OD as a one-off activity to a continuous process\nrequired to hone and improve performance over time.\u201d\n\n**OD Technology**\n\nOrganizational design no longer means a list of names on a spreadsheet or the\ncreation of a simple hierarchical chart. New HR technology can deliver\npowerful modeling tools and data that allow HR leaders to better visualize the\npeople, skills and competencies in their organization.\n\nIt has also become more precise. Instead of doing major restructuring, many\ncompanies are opting to focus on smaller slices within the organization\u2014or\nmicro-design\u2014by looking at more agile clusters of jobs and functions that\nallow for easier monitoring and faster transformation when challenges or\nopportunities arise.\n\nRegardless of the challenges they face or their level of involvement in this\nprocess, HR professionals can strengthen their proficiency in the [HR\ncompetencies](https://www.shrm.org/learningandcareer/competency-\nmodel/pages/default.aspx) necessary to make greater contributions toward\norganizational design efforts.\n\nHow are you handling organizational design at your organization?\n\nPlease join @shrmnextchat at 3pm ET on August 17 for #Nextchat with special\nguests SHRM Specialist, HR Competencies, Lindsay Northon\n([@HRCompetencies](https://twitter.com/HRcompetencies)); SHRM Senior\nSpecialist, HR Competencies, Ashley Miller\n([@Miller843](https://twitter.com/miller843)); and SHRM Director, HR\nCompetencies, Joe Jones\n([@josephajonesphd](https://twitter.com/josephajonesphd)).

(CRB) to head Railway Board as a Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) with 4 Members and some Independent Members\n\nThe Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved a\ntransformational organisational restructuring of the Indian Railways. This\nhistoric reform will go a long way in achieving Government's vision of making\nIndian Railways the growth engine of India's vikas yatra.\n\nThe reforms include:\n\ni. Unification of the existing eight Group A services of the Railways into a\nCentral Service called Indian Railway Management Service (/RMS)\n\nii. Re-organisation of Railway Board on functional lines headed by CRB with\nfour Members and some Independent Members\n\niii. The existing service of Indian Railway Medical Service (IRMS) to be\nconsequently renamed as Indian Railway Health Service (IRHS)\n\nRailways has an ambitious programme to modernise and provide the highest\nstandards of safety, speed and services to the passengers with a proposed\ninvestment of Rs 50 lakh crore over the next 12 years. This requires speed and\nscale, and a unified, agile organisation to work single-mindedly on this task\nand capable of responding to challenges. Today's reforms are in a series of\nreforms that have been undertaken under the present Government including\nmerger of Rail Budget with Union Budget, delegation of powers to empower GMs\nand field officers, allowing competitive operators to run trains etc.\n\nTo meet next level challenges and deal with various existing difficulties\nthere was a need to take this step. Unlike Railway systems the world over,\nwhich have been corporatized, Indian Railways is managed by the Government\ndirectly. It is organised into various departments such as Traffic, Civil,\nMechanical, Electrical, Signal & Telecom, Stores, Personnel, and Accounts etc.\nThese departments are vertically separated from top to bottom and are headed\nby a Secretary level officer (Member] in the Railway Board. This organization\nof the department runs deep down to the grassroot level of the Railways.\nUnification of services will end this 'departmentalism', promote smooth\nworking of Railways, expedite decision making, create a coherent vision for\norganisation and promote rational decision making.\n\nUnification of services has been recommended by various committees for\nreforming Railways including - the Prakash Tandon Committee (1994), Rakesh\nMohan Committee (2001), Sam Pitroda Committee (2012) and Bibek Debroy\nCommittee (2015).\n\nThis reform has been undertaken with the overwhelming support and consensus of\nRailway officers, at a two-day conference \"Parivartan Sangoshthi\" held in\nDelhi on 7th and 8th December, 2019. To act on this sentiment, and create\nconfidence in Railway officers that their suggestions are valued, Railway\nBoard held an Extraordinary meeting of the Board during the conference on 8th\nDecember, 2019 itself, and recommended a number of reforms including the ones\nmentioned.\n\nIt is now proposed to create a unified Group A' service called \"Indian\nRailways Management Service\" (IRMS) from the next recruitment cycle. Creation\nof the new service will be done in consultation with DoPT and UPSC to\nfacilitate recruitment in the next recruitment year. It will enable Railways\nto recruit engineers/non-engineers as per need, and offer equality of\nopportunity to both categories in career progression. The modalities and\nunification of the services will be worked out by the Ministry of Railways in\nconsultation with DoPT with the approval of Alternate Mechanism to be\nappointed by Cabinet in order to ensure fairness and transparency. The process\nshall be completed within a year.\n\nThe newly recruited officers will come from Engineering and non-Engineering\ndisciplines as per need and posted as per their aptitude and specialisation to\nallow them to specialise in one field, develop an overall perspective, and\nprepare them to take up general management responsibilities at senior levels.\nSelection for the general management positions shall be through a merit-based\nsystem.\n\nRailway board will no longer be organised on departmental lines, and replaced\nwith a leaner structure organised on functional lines. It will have a\nChairman, who will act as 'Chief Executive Officer (CEO)' along with 4 Members\nresponsible for Infrastructure, Operations & Business Development, Rolling\nStock and Finance respectively. The Chairman shall be the cadre controlling\nofficer responsible for Human resources (HR) with assistance from a DG (HR). 3\nApex level posts shall be surrendered from Railway Board and all the remaining\nposts of the Railway Board shall be open to all officers regardless of the\nservice to which they belonged. The Board will also have some independent\nMembers (the number to be decided by competent authority from time to time),\nwho will be highly distinguished professionals with deep knowledge and 30\nyears of experience including at the top levels in industry, finance,\neconomics and management fields. The Independent Members will help Railway\nBoard in setting a strategic direction. The restructured Board will start\nfunctioning after approval of the Board taking due care to ensure that\nofficers are posted in the restructured Board or adjusted in the same pay and\nrank till their retirement.\n\n ** _Powered by_ Capital Market - Live News**\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-\ngenerated from a syndicated feed.)\n\nFirst Published: Tue, December 24 2019. 18:47 IST\n\n  * Read More On\n  * ##

Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime. [Learn more about the available courses\n\u00bb](https://www.uniqskills.asia/)\n\nA global survey of more than 600 executive recruiters and leadership advisors\nfrom executive search firms, by the [Association of Executive Search and\nLeadership Consultants (AESC)](https://www.aesc.org/) has revealed that HR\ndepartments are significantly behind other functional departments when it\ncomes to digital transformation.\n\nLegal departments were ranked on par with HR, while marketing and technology\ndepartments were ranked the most digitally-advanced within organisations, in\nthe survey published in [AESC's Leading Transformation: Shaping the C-Suite\nfor Business 4.0 Innovation\nreport](https://www.aesc.org/insights/research/leading-transformation).\n\nThe global trend followed course in Asia as well, where the least digitally-\nadvanced function was legal, followed closely by HR at a score of 2.1 and 2.5\nrespectively (where 1 represents least advanced). Just over 13% of the\nrespondents were from Asia.\n\n![Priya-November-2018-Digital-transformation-HR-Chart1.3-report-\naesc](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/27103100/Priya-November-2018-Digital-transformation-\nHR-Chart1.3-report-aesc-700x371.jpg)\n\n\n\nThis functional gap within organisations, across industries and geographies,\nis creating major barriers to enterprise-wide digital transformation.\n\nThe survey also revealed the top five obstacles which prevent organisations\nfrom achieving enterprise-wide digital transformation:\n\n### **#1 Legacy approaches **\n\nThe conversion from idea to solution, the implementation of ideas, and\nactivation of the right leaders who understand and foster the transformation\nis found to be difficult. Therefore, many companies continue to follow old\nsuccess models, even if they increasingly do not work.\n\n### **#2 A lack of the right talent **\n\nAs one respondent from India put it: \"There is a demand for people who combine\ndifferent skills. I refer to it as a triangle\u2014a triangle of sought-after\nskills. It combines the three aspects of data analytics, technological fluency\nand business acumen. There is a huge mismatch in the demand for this type of\ntalent versus the supply.\"\n\n### **#3 Organisations are not investing enough**\n\nWhile leaders understand the need to digitally transform, many organisations\nfail to invest the time and resources into ensuring that there is a sound\nstrategy in place to make it happen.\n\nA respondent from Canada shared that leaders need to be aware of the new\ntechnologies transforming the workplace, explaining: \"Leaders of those\ninstitutions have to start thinking creatively about how the fundamental\nbusiness of their organisations and their sectors is changing and how do they\nget ahead of that now, because if they don\u2019t start thinking about those\nthings, they will be challenged.\"\n\n**ALSO READ:**[Want digital transformation to succeed? Get leaders to champion\nit through actions](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/want-digital-\ntransformation-to-succeed-get-leaders-to-champion-it-through-actions/)\n\n### **#4 A resistance to change**\n\nToday\u2019s leaders are managing workforces that have different levels of\nunderstanding regarding digital. An embrace of change to a digital culture\nrequires proper support and training to ensure a uniform understanding of the\nprocess.\n\nIt was also highlighted that organisations struggle to achieve digital\ntransformation because they do not have the culture to support it. When\nrespondents were asked to share the top elements required for a healthy\nculture, they rated: leaders who lead by example, clear communication, and an\nempowered workforce as the top three characteristics.\n\nOne respondent added: \"Businesses need to articulate the transformation they\nneed for their company and actively work to change the culture.\n\n\"What will they need to do to change the culture? To digitally transform, to\ninnovate, organisations need to change their cultures. They're not going to\nsucceed by just bringing in capable talent and paying high salaries. They have\nto shift the culture of the organisation. If they don\u2019t have innovation in the\nblood of their company, they\u2019re not going to succeed.\"\n\n> ##### Transformation is not something that can just be talked about. You\n> have to build the transformation. Transformation happens with the culture of\n> the company.\n\n### **#5 Organisations lack a clear definition of what it means for their\nbusiness**\n\nMany organisations lack a clear understanding of what digital transformation\nmeans. They have not defined it for their businesses. There is a lack of\nunderstanding, a lack of training, and often a perception that it is the\nresponsibility of one department.\n\nTo tackle this issue, one respondent suggested: \"Clear thinking about what\nthey want to accomplish or what problem they are trying to solve is necessary.\n\n\"We see many organisations trying to digitally transform and speed up poor\nprocesses rather than step back and contemplate how they could use new tools\nto do things in a better, faster, more cost-effective way.\"\n\n![Priya-November-2018-Digital-transformation-HR-Chart1.1-report-aesc-\nscreenshot](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/27113631/Priya-November-2018-Digital-transformation-\nHR-Chart1.1-report-aesc-screenshot-700x478.jpg)\n\n\n\nTo build a stronger, future-ready workforce for innovation, talent management\nis highlighted as a key factor to address. HR leaders need the right strategy\nin hiring talent:\n\n### **Be open to talent from other industries**\n\n\"Be open to talent from adjacent industries or other relevant talent pools. If\nit\u2019s financial services, the perfect candidate may not be someone from\nfinancial services. They might come from another heavily regulated industry,\nthey might come from retail. And it wouldn\u2019t need to come from retail\nfinancial services, necessarily, it could come from retail telecommunications\nor broader retail,\" one respondent advised.\n\n\"So, someone who understands the customer and customer propositions\u2014having\nthat focus rather than in the industry sector.\"\n\n### **Provide development opportunities to high potentials**\n\nOn this, one respondent commented that new development opportunities provided\nby organisations in an area of interest or mastery will inspire talented\npeople. He added: \"High performers tend to be motivated by opportunities that\nprovide sufficient challenge for personal growth. That tends to  \ndrive interest and creativity in people.\"\n\n### **Talk about the future**\n\nAccording to a respondent, \"Too many companies are talking to candidates about\nthe first year in the role and not about future plans. If you really want to\nmotivate a candidate who is well established where they are, it\u2019s important to\ntalk more about the future. And not talk just about the year to come.\"\n\nLastly, in terms of how significantly C-Suite roles have to change for a\nbetter leadership, CHROs fall in the middle with a score of 3.9 (1 being the\nleast change, 5 being the most) in Asia, between CFOs and CMOs. The following\nchart represents the full change required across regions:\n\n![Priya-November-2018-Digital-transformation-HR-Chart5.2-report-aesc-\nscreenshot.JPG](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/27103106/Priya-November-2018-Digital-transformation-\nHR-Chart5.2-report-aesc-screenshot.JPG-700x426.jpg)\n\n_All images / AESC_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

According to the chart, it appears CEO Elon Musk currently has 29\npeople reporting to him directly.\n\nImagine a gathering of your own direct reports. Not your entire team or your\nentire company, but just the people who have no other boss between you and\nthem. How many of them would there be? Whatever the number, I'm betting it's a\nlot lower than 29. According to The Information, Mary Barra, the CEO of\nGeneral Motors, has 12 direct reports. Ford CEO James Hackett has nine.\n\nAsked for a comment, Musk told The Information that an org chart pulled off\nthe site earlier this month was \"rife with errors.\" Beyond that, he did not\ncomment on the people reporting to him, except to say that it is \"high by most\nstandards.\"\n\nEven for Musk, 29 is an unusually high number of reports, and results in part\nfrom the recent turmoil at Tesla. What with the SEC investigation and lawsuit\ncaused by an ill-considered tweet that is [forcing Musk to step\ndown](http://inc.com/minda-zetlin/elon-musk-settles-sec-lawsuit-steps-down-as-\ntesla-chair-for-3-years.html) for three years as Tesla chair (while remaining\nCEO), an anguished and [sleep-deprived interview](http://www.inc.com/bill-\nmurphy-jr/elon-musk-says-he-isnt-sleeping-hasnt-taken-off-more-than-a-week-\nsince-2001.html) with  _The New York Times_ , and the struggle it took for the\ncompany to finally [meet its Model 3 production\ntarget](http://preview.inc.com/minda-zetlin/tesla-meets-production-goals-elon-\nmusk-51000-model-3-cars-in-third-quarter-of-2018.html), you could be forgiven\nfor failing to notice that in the middle of it all, the company had to lay off\n[9 percent of its employees](http://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/elon-musk-just-\nlaid-off-9-percent-of-tesla-how-does-he-feel-about-it-theres-a-surprising-\nclue-in-his-email.html).\n\nIt would be easier still not to notice the departure of upper executives this\nsummer and fall--particularly since the company is oddly closed-mouthed about\nall its executives other than Musk. Tesla does not provide an external\norganizational chart or even much information about its executive team. The\nonly information about management anywhere on the Tesla website lists only\nthree executives, Musk as chairman, product architect, and CEO, JB Straubel as\nCTO, and Deepak Ahuja as CFO.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, since early June, many[ many key executives have\ndeparted Tesla](http://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/elon-musk-just-laid-\noff-9-percent-of-tesla-how-does-he-feel-about-it-theres-a-surprising-clue-in-\nhis-email.html). These include Doug Field, SVP of engineering, Dave Morton,\nchief accounting officer, Gabrielle Toledano, chief people officer, and Sarah\nO'Brien, vice president of communications. Bloomberg reported that five more\nsenior executives besides these have left as well, and The Information\nreporter Amir Efrati noted that the internal org chart \"helped to confirm\"\nthat Gil Passin, head of manufacturing for years, was also gone from the\ncompany. And, The Information reported, Matt Casebolt, in charge of body and\ndoor development and a direct report of Doug Field's, was recently removed\nfrom the internal org chart, suggesting that he too has moved on. (Tesla would\nnot comment to The Information on whether Casebolt is still an employee and so\nfar has not responded at all to a request for comment from Inc.com.)\n\nThus, The Information estimates, about a dozen executives are reporting to\nMusk because their immediate boss left the company and has not yet been\nreplaced. Presumably--although really, who knows?--the company will fill those\nexecutive positions at some point and Musk will go back to a more \"normal\"\nestimated 18 direct reports.\n\nMusk has said he wants Tesla to be a flatter organization, and indeed [flat\norganizational structures](https://www.inc.com/leigh-buchanan/sky-factory-\nputs-transparency-and-flat-management-to-the-test.html) are a popular concept\nand can confer competitive advantage for many reasons, including that you save\na lot of money on manager salaries. But Tesla's lack of transparency about its\nleadership team other than Musk is pretty weird. One insider told The\nInformation that Tesla's management team has few meetings and its members are\nrarely all in the same place. If true, that's weird as well. Meantime, Musk is\nknown for often communicating directly with employees who would be far below\nhim in the hierarchy if there was one. It all points to something we all\nalready know about Musk: He's [bad at delegating](http://www.inc.com/minda-\nzetlin/elon-musk-arianna-huffington-tesla-overwork-sleep-rest-productivity-\nthrive-global.html).\n\nHe needs to get better. Executives who don't feel their CEO trusts them to\nhandle the people and projects directly assigned to them are likelier to quit.\nSo are executives whose bosses hog the limelight and leave them in the\nshadows. We may be seeing both these dynamics in action at Tesla.\n\nMusk could do himself and his company a huge favor by bringing some of his\nexecutive team more into the public eye, and trusting them to oversee their\nown areas. Better yet, he could finally get a little sleep.\n\nPublished on: Oct 24, 2018\n\nLike this column?

But in the decades that followed, CIOs\nthemselves rewrote the perception of their role, coming out of the back office\nto become true strategic business partners, working alongside their C-suite\npeers. Today, CEOs look to the CIO to drive innovation and revenue-generating\nideas throughout the business.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from a running joke In the early 2000\u2019s: that CIO stood for\n\u201ccareer is over.\u201d Today, the CIO in many organizations leads the execution of\n[digital transformation initiatives](https://enterprisersproject.com/what-is-\ndigital-transformation).\n\nMany businesses see those initiatives - often centered around improved\ncustomer experience - as vital to their very survival. The CIO investigates\nhow the organization can use its technological prowess, speed, and customer\nservice to outperform rivals. This typically involves both building a [digital\nplatform](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2018/12/what-digital-\nplatform) and adjusting the organization\u2019s operating model.\n\nMany CIOs came up through the ranks in a culture that was known for its\n\u201ccommand and control\u201d style. But today, CEOs charge CIOs with working on\ncross-functional efforts that demand collaboration and a broader leadership\nskill set, including strong[ emotional\nintelligence](https://enterprisersproject.com/tags/emotional-intelligence).\n\nAs [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/) CIO Chris Bedi puts it, [the CIO\nrole currently requires the CIO to embody three crucial\npersonas](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2018/2/3-crucial-personas-\nsuccessful-cios): communicator, salesperson, and influencer.\n\n\u201cThe biggest lesson learned from my first job in the CIO position was how\ncritical it is, more than ever, that the strategy at the CIO level is\ncompletely aligned to enable the overall business strategy,\u201d Bedi says. \u201cAs\nwe\u2019ve seen time and time again in today\u2019s workplace, technology helps enable\nnew ways of business, collaboration, productivity \u2013 the potential and\npossibilities are endless. However, \u2018new\u2018 is often synonymous with \u2018change,\u2018\nand change is often met with trepidation. CIOs must sell the vision that\ntechnology will make life better across the entire business.\u201d\n\n**[ Do you make thoughtful decisions?

The old leadership rules don\u2019t apply,\u201d\nthe report says.\n\nAs [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com) SVP and CIO [Cynthia\nStoddard](https://enterprisersproject.com/user/cynthia-stoddard) says, \u201cWhen\nyou work cross-functionally, you can\u2019t control everything. You need to\ncollaborate and work together in different ways. At Adobe, we put aside titles\nwhen we\u2019re working across teams to encourage everyone to participate and\ncontribute at the same level.\u201d\n\n![](https://enterprisersproject.com/sites/default/files/pictures/bio_cynthiastoddard.png)[Giving\nup control and embracing failure are\nkey](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2018/5/adobe-cio-cross-\nfunctional-collaboration-requires-embracing-failure-and-loss-control),\nStoddard says. \u201cOne example of these two mindset changes in practice was our\ndata-driven operating model, where we integrated data across the entire\nenterprise into a unified data architecture \u2013 to run the business, drive\npredictive data insights, and deliver personalization. It\u2019s always challenging\nwhen you have to get everyone on board with definitions, KPIs, governance, and\nbring together the right level of insight.\n\n\u201cThis was truly a cross-functional effort, in which everyone from finance to\nproduct teams came together to lay out the vision. People had to give up\nindividual tools and move toward a new way of working. If an idea didn\u2019t pan\nout in the way we expected it to, we learned from it and applied those lessons\nto new ideas.\u201d\n\nThat type of iteration exemplifies the agile style of work that many digital\nenterprises have found essential to improving time to market and customer\nexperience.\n\n**[ Culture change is the hardest part of digital transformation.

He predicts CIOs will shape more HR\nissues in 2020.\n\n\"The CIO and CHRO are partnering more to make the employee experience as great\nas the customer experience.\"\n\n\u201cLike the CIO, the CHRO is also stepping into a more strategic role, and as a\nresult, the CIO and CHRO are partnering more to make the employee experience\nas great as the customer experience,\u201d Bedi says. \u201cIT and HR teams are aligned\nat a high level and want to create great experiences, but they\u2019re also often\nfocused on different initiatives. To achieve both objectives, IT and HR will\nbegin to work together more closely to create a common framework and language,\nas well as a joint plan.\u201d\n\nExpect CIOs to take more of a lead on hiring and training for new skills and\nidentifying who enterprises need to develop over the near- to medium-term,\npredicts Patrick Heffernan, senior analyst at [Technology Business\nResearch](https://tbri.com/author/patrick-heffernan/page/2/).\u201cCIOs that are\nactive now in setting the training agenda are the ones to watch,\u201d he adds.\n\n## ****What are key leadership skills for CIOs?****\n\nWhile CIOs used to make their careers on their tech credentials, today\u2019s most\nsuccessful CIOs stand out for other skills, including communication, building\nbridges between groups, and empathy \u2013 all-important at times of big cultural\nchange.\n\nYou might call them \u201csoft skills,\u201d but any CIO will tell you these are the\nhardest skills to learn.

As the pace of change accelerates today \u2013 and at a time when\ntechnology is in many respects the asset of a company \u2013 organizations are\ndemanding their IT departments demonstrate more leadership than ever before.\n\n\u201cAs their teams become more inclusive and collaborative, leaders must shift\ntheir strategies and tactics to harness the energy this new style of work\ngenerates,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cThey need to perfect their methods for drawing\nmultiple parties into a dialog and ensuring everyone feels heard. And they\nneed to hone their abilities to connect the work their teams are doing to\ntheir organization\u2019s values, aims, and goals \u2013 to make sure everyone in the\ndepartment understands that they\u2019re part of something bigger than themselves\n(and their individual egos).\n\n******[ Want to build these skills?

Some people hold the CTO title without much difference in\nresponsibility from a CIO. At other firms, the CTO focuses more on external\nproducts, especially in technology companies.\n\n****\n\nWhether a company has a CIO, a chief technology officer (CTO), or both depends\non company culture.\n\n****\n\nFor example, Jenny Peng told us about [her transition from CIO to\nCTO](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2017/6/cio-cto-my-transition) at\n[Aptean](https://www.aptean.com). \u201cAs Aptean\u2019s CIO, my customers were internal\n\u2013 our users and business units. In the CTO role, my customers are external.\nInstead of improving the bottom line (increasing profitability), the focus is\non developing strategies to increase the company\u2019s top-line revenue,\u201d she\nsays.\n\n\u201cHere at Aptean, both CIO and CTO roles are tasked to be technology thought\nbrokers in the enterprise, helping to figure out how to leverage technology to\nenable the business. The difference with the CTO role is that I am looking to\ncommercialize and monetize technology. In the CIO role, I focused more on\noptimizing, streamlining, and allowing employees to be more productive with\ntools to get their job done more quickly and easily.\u201d\n\n[Sven Gerjets](https://enterprisersproject.com/user/sven-gerjets) is EVP and\nchief technology officer at toymaker [Mattel](https://www.mattel.com). Here\u2019s\nhow he [describes his\nrole](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2018/9/mattel-cto-4-principles-\ndigital-transformation): \u201cLike many tech execs, I was hired to wear multiple\nhats. When I joined Mattel [in 2017], I was tasked with moving the company\ninto the future by shifting the technology organization into a more strategic\nfunction, modernizing our business systems, and figuring out how to utilize\ntech with toys in a more cost-effective and scalable way.\u201d\n\n****![](https://enterprisersproject.com/sites/default/files/Bryson%20Koehler%202.png)****[Bryson\nKoehler](https://enterprisersproject.com/user/bryson-koehler) served as chief\ntechnology and information officer at [The Weather Channel\nCompanies](https://weather.com) (TWCC) before it was acquired in 2015 by[\nIBM](https://www.ibm.com). Today he serves as CTO at\n[Equifax](https://www.equifax.com/): \u201cAt Equifax, one of the most exciting\naspects of my job is our work to build a culture that embraces new\nchallenges,\" he [says](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/2/equifax-\ncto-3-keys-leading-culture-change). \"I often view myself as the \u2018chief\ndisruption officer\u2019 because I think we constantly have to help our teams feel\ncomfortable disrupting themselves, pressurize the culture, change the way we\nthink and the way we interact.\u201d\n\n## ********What does a CIO do?********\n\nWhile CIOs used to make their careers on cost-efficient and reliable\ninfrastructure, today they make their careers on revenue-generating ideas. As\npreviously noted, many CIOs play a central role in digital transformation.\n\nListen to how Equifax\u2019s Koehler [describes his main job right\nnow](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/2/equifax-cto-3-keys-\nleading-culture-change): The key word is culture. \u201cWhether you\u2019re in the midst\nof a transformation or operating in daily maintenance mode, [culture\nchange](https://enterprisersproject.com/tags/culture) is the most difficult\npart of any technology leader\u2019s job. At its core, culture is about the way\npeople think, talk, and interact with each other. If that foundation is not in\nplace for the leadership team and your line-level employees, dysfunction,\nfinger-pointing, perceived bureaucracy, and missed opportunities will creep\nin.\n\n****\n\nTechnology leadership is different today than it was just five years ago.\n\n****\n\n\u201cTechnology leadership is different today than it was just five years ago.\nMany technology problems that were priorities in the past have become\ncommoditized, simply consumed services. Because there are less underlying\ntechnologies to invent and fewer basic technology problems to solve, our\nunique value as technology leaders is in how we assemble these services to\noperate more dynamically and provide better uptime, performance, and responses\nto our customers\u2019 needs.\n\n\u201cTechnology leaders of today must balance creating like-mindedness with the\nability to promote, debate, and allow different ideas to flourish while also\nmaking clear, quick decisions and creating an environment in which everyone\nsupports those ideas as if they were their own,\u201d Koehler says.\n\nIn other words, today\u2019s CIOs are not only sharp analysts on the lookout for\nbusiness opportunities, but also skilled people motivators.\n\n****\n\n\u201cEvery CIO I know is emphasizing the essential value of leadership,\ncommunication, agility, and the other non-technical competencies.\u201d\n\n****\n\n[Dan Roberts](https://enterprisersproject.com/user/dan-roberts), CEO of\n[Ouellette & Associates](https://www.ouellette-online.com/) Consulting,\n[argues](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/8/why-soft-skills-core-\nto-IT) that those people skills are so critical, in fact, that IT needs to\nstop calling them soft skills and rebrand them as core skills. \u201cThere\u2019s\nnothing soft about [soft\nskills](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2018/2/top-soft-skills-it-\nleaders-and-how-master-them). Every CIO I know is emphasizing the essential\nvalue of leadership, communication, agility, and the other non-technical\ncompetencies,\u201d notes Roberts. \u201cCIOs tell me we must put more emphasis on them\nbecause these are the skills that drive IT success.\u201d\n\nA CIO\u2019s top concerns today often start with security, in partnership with the\nCSO. (If you want a refresher on the history of the CSO role, check out this\none, at CIO.com: [The unique story and evolution of the CSO\nrole](https://www.cio.com/article/2427347/the-unique-story-and-evolution-of-\nthe-cso-role.html).)\n\nOn the emerging technology front, a top CIO concern is how to apply\n[AI](https://enterprisersproject.com/tags/artificial-intelligence) and\n[machine learning](https://enterprisersproject.com/tags/machine-learning) in\nsensible and ethical ways.\n\nThen there\u2019s the matter of how to make use of \u2013 and protect \u2013 ever-growing\npools of data. But again, these problems also call on the CIO\u2019s people skills.\nAs [Jonathan Feldman](https://enterprisersproject.com/user/jonathan-feldman),\nCIO of the city of Asheville, NC,\n[notes](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/6/data-\nstrategy-5-lessons), when his team opened up data sets to new internal and\nexternal customers, the hardest part was the people management challenges.\n\u201cData by itself won\u2019t be used usefully without data engagement. You need to\nmake relationships \u2013 with people in your community, with other partners, and\nwith other departments \u2013 before you need them.\u201d (Read also: [5 lessons on the\npeople side of data: City of Asheville\nCIO](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/6/data-strategy-5-lessons).)\n\n## ********Who does a CIO report to?********\n\nWhile CIOs and IT leaders traditionally reported up through finance, that has\nbecome less common. Many CIOs say a direct reporting relationship to the CEO\nworks best. This is also often a signal to job-hunting CIOs of a progressive\norganization, recruiters say.\n\n\u201cThe top four reporting structures for a CIO are to the CEO, COO, CFO, and \u2013\nat times \u2013 the CAO,\u201d says Carol Lynn Thistle, managing director at CIO\nrecruiting firm [Heller Search Associates](https://www.hellersearch.com/).\n\u201cThe CIO is required to know every aspect of operations in a company, and in\norder to do that they must be situated correctly on the org chart,\u201d Thistle\nsays. \u201cWith every company essentially becoming a technology company, the CIO\nreporting to the CEO makes the most sense, regardless of industry.\u201d\n\nA recent [study](https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/cio-insider-\nbusiness-insights/trends-in-cio-reporting-structure.html) by Deloitte\u2019s U.S.\nCIO Program found that just over half (51 percent) of CIOs in the U.S. were\nreporting to the chief executive (as were 40 percent of global CIOs overall).\n\n\u201cWhile the number of CIOs reporting to C-suite executives other than the CEO\nhas been declining through the years, [Forrester](https://go.forrester.com/)\nfound that almost half still do. Its [Predictions 2020:\nCIO](https://www.forrester.com/report/Predictions+2020+CIO/-/E-RES157605)\nreport went further, suggesting that companies that failed to change their CIO\nreporting structure to reflect the business-critical nature of the role would\nstruggle to hit their growth targets,\u201d as we recently reported.\n\nHowever, in some cases, a different reporting relationship than CIO/CEO may\nfit.

CIO Salary********\n\n****\n\nThe average CIO makes $170,726, according to Glassdoor data.\n\n****\n\nThe average CIO makes $170,726 in annual base pay, according to [Glassdoor\ndata](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/cio-salary-SRCH_KO0,3.htm). (Their\nestimates are based on salaries submitted anonymously to the site.) Of course,\nmost CIO compensation packages come in much higher than that, including stock,\nbonuses, and other [perks.](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2018/7/it-\nsalary-extras-5-perks-worth-pursuing) The average CIO earns additional cash\ncompensation of $38,863 a year, according to Glassdoor's data.\n\nSome CIOs rake in $1 million to $10 million in extras, as\n[CIO.com](http://cio.com/) points out in its [comparison of 25 Fortune 500 CIO\npay packages](https://www.cio.com/article/3243285/careers-staffing/how-much-\ndo-cios-really-make-pay-packages-of-25-fortune-500-execs-\nrevealed.html#slide1).\n\nHow does this compare to other IT salaries? According to the [Robert Half\nTechnology](https://www.roberthalf.com/work-with-us/our-services/technology)\n2020 [salary guide](https://www.roberthalf.com/salary-guide/technology), which\nrates [top IT jobs by salary for\n2020](https://www.roberthalf.com/blog/salaries-and-skills/the-13-highest-\npaying-it-jobs-in-2019) (ranked by national median salary) big data engineer\nchecks in at number one, at $163,250.\n\n******[ Which certifications will advance your IT career, pointing you toward\na CIO role?

Neilson](http://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/author?author=Gary+L.+Neilson), [Jaime\nEstupi\u00f1\u00e1n](http://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/author?author=Jaime+Estupi%C3%B1%C3%A1n), and [Bhushan\nSethi](http://www.strategy-business.com/author?author=Bhushan+Sethi)\n\nIn the [18th annual PwC survey of chief executive\nofficers](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/ceo-survey/index.html), conducted in 2014,\nmany CEOs anticipated significant disruptions to their businesses during the\nnext five years as a result of external worldwide trends. One such trend,\ncited by 61 percent of the respondents, was an increasing number of\ncompetitors. The same number of respondents foresaw changes in customer\nbehavior creating disruption. Fifty percent said they expected changes in\ndistribution channels. As CEOs look to stay ahead of these trends, they\nrecognize the need to change the organization\u2019s design. But for that redesign\nto be successful, a company must make its changes as effectively and\npainlessly as possible, in a way that aligns with its strategy, invigorates\nemployees, builds distinctive new capabilities, and makes it easier to attract\ncustomers.\n\nToday, the average tenure for the CEO of a global company is about five years.\nTherefore, a major reorganization is likely to happen only once during that\nleader\u2019s term. The chief executive has to get the reorg right the first time;\nhe or she won\u2019t get a second chance. Although every company is different, and\nthere is no set formula for determining your appropriate organization design,\nwe have identified [10 guiding principles](http://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/article/00318?gko=c7329) that apply to every company. These have\narisen from years of collective research and practice at PwC and Strategy&,\nusing changes in organization design to dramatically improve performance in\nmore than 400 companies across industries and geographies. These fundamental\nprinciples point the way for leaders whose evolving strategies require a\ndifferent kind of organization than the one they have today.\n\n**1\\. Declare amnesty for the past.**  Organization design should start with\ncorporate self-reflection: What is your sense of purpose? How will you make a\ndifference for your clients, employees, and investors? What will set you apart\nfrom others, now and in the future? What differentiating capabilities will\nallow you to deliver your value proposition over the next two to five years?\nAnswering those questions means letting go of the past. Avoid getting caught\nup in discussing the pros and cons of the old organization by declaring\n\u201camnesty for the past.\u201d Collectively, explicitly decide that you will neither\nblame nor try to justify the design in place today, or any organization\ndesigns of the past. This type of pronouncement may sound simplistic, but it\u2019s\nsurprisingly effective for keeping the focus on the new strategy.\n\nToday In: [Business](https://www.forbes.com/business)\n\n  * [\n\n### Influential Folk Musician John Prine Dead At 73 From Coronavirus\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2020/04/08/influential-folk-\nmusician-john-prine-dead-at-73-from-coronavirus/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Tesla Plans Pay Cuts And Worker Furloughs As COVID-19 Shutdown Drags On\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/04/08/tesla-plans-pay-cuts-\nand-worker-furloughs-as-covid-19-shutdown-drags-on/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Apartment Industry Calls On Congress To Provide More Support To Renters,\nRental Operators\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brendarichardson/2020/04/07/apartment-industry-\ncalls-on-congress-to-provide-more-support-to-renters-rental-operators/)\n\n **2\\. Design with the \u201cDNA.\u201d**  Organization design can seem unnecessarily\ncomplex; the right framework, however, can help you decode and prioritize the\nnecessary elements. We have identified [eight universal building\nblocks](http://www.pwc.com/us/en/10minutes/organizational-dna.jhtml) that are\nrelevant to any company, regardless of industry, geography, or business model.\nThese building blocks will be the elements you put together for your design.\nYou may be tempted to make changes with all eight building blocks\nsimultaneously. But too many interventions at once could interact in\nunexpected ways, leading to unfortunate side effects. Pick a small number of\nchanges\u2014four or five at most\u2014that you believe will deliver the greatest\ninitial impact. Even a few changes could involve many variations; for example,\nthe design of motivators might need to vary from one function to the next.\nPeople in sales might be more heavily influenced by monetary rewards, whereas\nR&D staffers might favor a career model with opportunities for self-directed\nprojects and external collaboration and education.\n\n**3\\. Fix the structure last, not first.**  The org chart is the most\nseemingly powerful communications vehicle around. It also carries emotional\nweight, because it defines reporting relationships that people might love or\nhate. But a company hierarchy, particularly when changes in the org chart are\nmade in isolation from other changes, tends to revert to its earlier\nequilibrium. You can significantly remove management layers and temporarily\nreduce costs, but all too soon, the layers creep back in and the short-term\ngains disappear. In an org redesign, you\u2019re not setting up a new form for the\norganization all at once. You\u2019re laying out a sequence of interventions that\nwill lead the company from the past to the future. Structure should be the\nlast thing you design: the capstone, not the cornerstone, of that sequence.\nOtherwise, the change won\u2019t sustain itself.\n\n**4\\. Make the most of top talent.**  You might assume that the personalities\nand capabilities of existing executive team members won\u2019t affect the design\nmuch. But in reality, you need to design positions to make the most of the\nstrengths of the people who will occupy them. In other words, consider the\ntechnical skills and managerial acumen of key people, and make sure those\nleaders are equipped to foster the collaboration and empowerment needed from\npeople below them. As you assemble the leadership team for your strategy, look\nfor an optimal span of control\u2014the number of direct reports\u2014for your senior\nexecutive positions. Although many executives have seven direct reports,\nthere\u2019s no single magic number. For CEOs, the optimal span of control depends\non four factors: the CEO\u2019s position in the executive life cycle, the degree of\ncross-collaboration among business units, the level of CEO activity devoted to\nsomething other than working with direct reports, and the presence or absence\nof a second role as chairman of the board. (We\u2019ve created a [C-level span-of-\ncontrol\ndiagnostic](http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/global/home/what_we_do/services/ocl/ocl_thought_leadership/structure_at_the_top/span-\nof-control-diagnostic) to help determine your target span.)\n\n**5\\. Focus on what you can control.**  Make a list of the things that hold\nyour organization back: the scarcities (things you consistently find in short\nsupply) and constraints (things that consistently slow you down). Taking stock\nof real-world limitations helps ensure that you can execute and sustain the\nnew organization design.Constraints on your business\u2014such as regulations,\nsupply shortages, and changes in customer demand\u2014may be out of your control.\nBut it\u2019s important not to get bogged down in trying to change something you\ncan\u2019t change; instead, focus on changing what you can. For example, if your\ncompany is a global consumer packaged goods (CPG) manufacturer, you might\nfirst favor a single global structure with clear decision rights on branding,\npolicies, and usage guidelines because it is more efficient in global\nbranding. But if consumer tastes for your product are different around the\nworld, then you might be better off with a structure that tends to delegate\ndecision rights to the local business leader.\n\n**6\\. Promote accountability.**  Design your organization so that it\u2019s easy\nfor people to be accountable for their part of the work without being\nmicromanaged. Make sure that decision rights are clear and that information\nflows rapidly and clearly from the executive committee to business units,\nfunctions, and departments. When decision rights and motivators are\nestablished, accountability can take hold. Gradually, people get in the habit\nof following through on commitments without experiencing formal enforcement.\nEven after it becomes part of the company\u2019s culture, this new accountability\nmust be continually nurtured and promoted. It won\u2019t endure if, for example,\nnew additions to the firm don\u2019t honor commitments, or incentives change in a\nway that undermines the desired behavior.\n\n**7\\. Benchmark sparingly, if at all.**  In theory, it can be helpful to track\nwhat competitors are doing, if only to help you optimize your own design or\nuncover issues requiring attention. But in practice, this approach ignores\nyour organization\u2019s unique capabilities system\u2014the strengths that only your\norganization has, producing results that others can\u2019t match. You and your\ncompetitor aren\u2019t likely to need the same distinctive capabilities, even if\nyou\u2019re in the same industry. For example, two banks might look similar on the\nsurface. But the first could be a national bank catering to Millennials, who\nare drawn to low costs and innovative online banking. The other could be\nregionally oriented, serving an older customer base and emphasizing community\nties and personalized customer service. Those different value propositions\nwould require different capabilities, and translate into different\norganization designs. If you feel you must benchmark, focus on a few select\nbenchmarks and the appropriate peers for each. Your choice of companies to\nfollow, and of the indicators to track and analyze, should line up exactly\nwith the capabilities you prioritized in setting your future course.\n\n**8\\. Let the \u201clines and boxes\u201d fit your company\u2019s purpose.**  For every\ncompany, there is an optimal pattern of \u201clines and boxes\u201d\u2014a golden mean. It\nisn\u2019t the same for every company; it should reflect the strategy you have\nchosen, and it should support the most critical capabilities that distinguish\nyour company. That means that the right structure for one company will not be\nthe same as the right structure for another, even if they\u2019re in the same\nindustry. In particular, think through your purpose when designing the spans\nof control (how many people report directly to any given manager) and layers\n(how far removed a manager is from the CEO) in your org chart. These should be\nfairly consistent across the organization.\n\n**9\\. Accentuate the informal.**  Formal elements like structure and\ninformation flow are attractive to companies because they\u2019re tangible. They\ncan be easily defined and measured. But they\u2019re only half the story. Many\ncompanies reassign decision rights, rework the org chart, or set up knowledge-\nsharing systems\u2014yet don\u2019t see the results they expect. That\u2019s because they\u2019ve\nignored the more informal, intangible building blocks. Norms, commitments,\nmind-sets, and networks are essential in getting things done. They represent\n(and influence) the ways people think, feel, communicate, and behave. When\nthese intangibles are not in sync with each other or the more tangible\nbuilding blocks, the organization doesn\u2019t work as it should.\n\n**10\\. Build on your strengths.**  Overhauling your organization is one of the\nhardest things for a chief executive or division leader to do, especially if\nhe or she is charged with turning around a poorly performing company. But\nthere are always strengths to build on in existing practices and in the\nculture. Look to these strengths\u2014whether formal or informal\u2014to help you fix\nthose critical areas that you\u2019ve prioritized. Suppose, for example, that your\ncompany has a norm of customer-oriented commitment. Employees are willing to\ngo the extra mile for customers when called upon to do so, delivering work out\nof scope or ahead of schedule, often because they empathize with the problems\ncustomers face. You can draw attention to that behavior by setting up groups\nto talk about it, and reinforce the behavior by rewarding it with more formal\nincentives. That will help spread it throughout the company.\n\nA [2014 Strategy&\nsurvey](http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/global/home/press/displays/concerns-\nexecutives-strategy-execution-gap) found that 42 percent of executives felt\nthat their organizations were not aligned with their strategy, and that parts\nof the organization resisted it or didn\u2019t understand it. The principles in\nthis article can help you develop an organization design that supports your\nmost distinctive capabilities and supports your strategy more effectively.\n\n_**This article has been adapted from**_ ** _ _** **strategy+business   _with\npermission_** _ **.

Among the 7,000+ companies who responded (in over 130 countries),\nthe #1 issue on [leaders](http://www.forbes.com/leaders/) minds is \"how to\nredesign our organizational structure\" to meet the demands of the workforce\nand business climate today.\n\nThe conclusion, after almost a year of study, is that today's digital world of\nwork has  _shaken the foundation_  of organizational structure, shifting from\nthe traditional functional hierarchy to one Deloitte calls a \" _network of\nteams_.\" This new model of work is forcing us to change job roles and job\ndescriptions; rethink [careers](http://www.forbes.com/careers/) and internal\nmobility; emphasize skills and learning as keys to performance; redesign how\nwe set goals and reward people; and change the role of leaders.\n\n![Fig 1: The New Organization: A Network of\nTeams](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAASyAAAAJDg3ZTc5ZjAwLWQzMGMtNDMwZC05N2JiLWVhZWU4NDk5NzIyNg.jpg)\n\nFig 1: The New Organization: A Network of Teams\n\nThe research, which identifies the top ten human capital trends for 2016,\nshows that most of the issues facing companies today (employee engagement,\nculture, time to market, innovation) are tied inextricably to this new way of\nworking. And 92% of the companies Deloitte surveyed cited \"redesigning the way\nwe work\" as one of their key challenges, making this the #1 trend of the year.\n\n![Fig 2: Relative Importance of the Ten Global Human Capital\nTrends](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAbyAAAAJDZjZmZjNjM1LWVhODYtNDkxZi1iMjJiLTA3Y2VmNzcwODE3Mw.jpg)\n\nFig 2: Relative Importance of the Ten Global Human Capital Trends\n\nToday In: [Leadership](https://www.forbes.com/leadership)\n\n  * [\n\n### Judges Slap Down USCIS Again On H-1B Visas\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2020/04/08/judges-slap-down-\nuscis-again-on-h-1b-visas/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Macy\u2019s CFO Resigns As Troubled Retailer Tries To Stay Afloat\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ezequielminaya/2020/04/07/macys-cfo-resigns-as-\ntroubled-retailer-tries-to-stay-afloat/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n **What Is A  \"Network of Teams\" And Why Now?**\n\nIf you look at the research, you find that companies already operate this way.\nOnly 24% of large companies (>5,000 employees) claim to be functionally\norganized and only 38% overall.  We naturally run our businesses in sales\nteams, manufacturing plants, retail stores, product groups, service teams, and\ngeographically independent operations.\n\nUber, who is well known as one of the most disruptive and innovative companies\nin transportation, sets up city managers who run their local operation with\nlocal marketing, government relations, staffing, and operations leaders.\n\nThe problem we face, however, is how we coordinate and align these teams, how\nwe get them to share information and work together, and how we move people and\nreward people in a company that no longer promotes \"upward mobility\" and\n\"power by position\" in [leadership](http://www.forbes.com/leadership/).\n\nAs the trends above show, the new organization of today requires us to rethink\nthe leadership strategy, focus on culture and engagement, deliver on-demand\norganizational learning, and provide information centers, analytics, and\ndigital HR tools to help people operate, share information, and work together\nwell.\n\nI have had the opportunity to talk with dozens of companies about this over\nthe last year, and I believe this is a profound new way of thinking about\nbusiness. We have to think of companies like \"Hollywood Movies\" - people come\ntogether and bring their skills and abilities to projects and programs, they\nbuild and deliver the solution, and then many of them move on to the next\n\"movie\" later.\n\nThe research identified four keys to success in this new organizational model:\n\n**1\\. Shared values and culture.** As people operate in geographically\ndispersed teams which are closer to customers, they need guidelines and value\nsystems to help them decide what to do, how to make decisions, and what is\nacceptable behavior. This is driven by mission, culture, and values - hence\nthe tremendous interest in understanding, measuring, and aligning culture (86%\nof companies rate this as important). The trend entitled \"Shape Culture, Drive\nStrategy\" and the article \"[Why Culture is the Hottest Trend in Business\nToday](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/03/13/culture-why-its-the-\nhottest-topic-in-business-today/#da0065fb6e28)\" describe this topic in detail.\n\n**2\\. Transparent goals and projects.** People operating in teams and small\ngroups have to work with other teams, and they can't do this unless goals are\nclear, overall financial objectives are well communicated, and people know\nwhat other people are working on. The research on [next generation performance\nmanagement](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2013/05/06/time-to-scrap-\nperformance-appraisals/#614152c5121d) and \"[The End of the Bell\nCurve](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2014/02/19/the-myth-of-the-bell-\ncurve-look-for-the-hyper-performers/#5fe0e05213fc)\" describe this in detail\n\n**3\\. Feedback and a free flow of information.** As teams operate and\ncustomers interact with the company, we must share information about what's\nworking, what isn't working, what's selling, and what problems we have to\naddress. While local [management](http://www.forbes.com/management/) and team\nleadership (i.e. a plant manager or sales leader) should take immediate\nresponsibility for errors, others need to know what problems are taking place,\nso they can respond to support the team. This takes place today in digital\ninformation centers, analytics dashboards, and free flowing feedback systems\nthat have replaced annual engagement surveys and performance reviews.Solutions\nrequire a focus on open and transparent feedback, digital information centers,\nand building an open and inclusive culture. The research on \"[Feedback is the\nKiller App](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/08/26/employee-\nfeedback-is-the-killer-app-a-new-market-emerges/#28e148ec6626)\" and the\narticle \"[Why Inclusion is A Critical Business Strategy in\n2016](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-diversity-inclusion-op-\npriority-2016-josh-bersin)\" describe this in more detail.\n\n**4\\. People are rewarded for skills and contribution, not position.\n**Finally, the network of teams rewards people for their contribution, not\ntheir \"position.\" The days of \"positional leadership\" are going away (i.e.\n\"I'm the boss so you do what I say.\") to be replaced by growth and career\nprogression based on your skills, alignment with values, followership, and\ncontribution to the company as a whole. The chapter \"Leadership Awakened:\nGenerations, Teams, Science\" describes the findings here.\n\nThese HR and organizational changes have been taking place for years, but are\nnow accelerating because of the widespread use of digital technology, a\ndemanding younger workforce, and the need for more rapid business innovation.\nArtifacts like organization charts, job descriptions, performance appraisals,\nand career paths are being reinvented, redesigned, or even thrown away before\nour eyes.\n\n**The Research: Top 10 Trends Discovered**\n\nThe title of the report, \"The New Organization: Different by Design\" came from\na detailed study of global trends.\n\nThis is Deloitte's fourth year conducting this research, and this year there\nwere more than 7,000 respondents in more than 130 countries. It analyzed and\nsorted the data by industry, company size, and geography and found that the\ntrends highlighted are both global and important to companies of all sizes.\n\nHere are the ten trends.\n\n![Fig 3: The Ten Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends for\n2016](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAPeAAAAJGI4ZjRlMGMzLWUyNDQtNGVjMS05NThhLWIwYzZiZWNmMjA0MQ.jpg)\n\nFig 3: The Ten Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends for 2016\n\nOn the topic of structure, the research found that only 26% of large companies\n(> 5,000 employees) are functionally organized today (ie. sales, marketing,\nfinance, engineering, service, etc.) and 82% are either currently\nreorganizing, plan to reorganize or have recently reorganized to be more\nresponsive to customer needs. The issue of structure is quite dynamic as we\nall know: among these companies _only 8% believe their structure is optimized\nand only 4% have no plans to change._\n\nAs Deloitte talked with companies and explored this issue, it realized that\nthe drivers of this trend are digital technology, information transparency,\ndemographics, and business disruption. Cisco, GE, Cleveland Clinic, and most\nof the other companies interviewed told of stories about how their functional\nstructures were obsolete, and that this new \"team-based\" structure was one\nthat appealed to Millennials, drove innovation and customer service, and was\nnow possible to manage well because of the widespread use of digital\ntechnology to share information.\n\nMany of us remember the old fashioned \"matrix organizations\" which were\npopular in the 1980s. Well today the \"matrix\" makes a company look more like a\nseries of Hollywood movies, where people take their skills and functional\nexpertise, they work on a \"project\" or \"team\" or \"program\" to get work done,\nand as they learn and the company adapts, they move into another team over\ntime.\n\nWhile there are still senior executives in the company, leadership now becomes\na \"team sport,\" where leaders must inspire and align the team, but also be\ngood at connecting teams together and sharing information.\n\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal, in the book _Team of Teams_ , describes how this\nstructure helped the US Army during in the war in Iraq. He had to dismantle\nthe functional structure in place, build these teams, empower team leaders to\ntake charge, and build a digital information center to help these teams\ncoordinate. This story of \"coordinated but distributed operations\" is what's\nhappening in almost every company surveyed, but the talent and HR practices\nare still behind.\n\n**Leadership: More Important Than Ever,  But Viewed In A New Lense**\n\nAs the data in the trends chart shows, the second issue companies now face is\nleadership - an even bigger problem than in the 2015 study. 90% of companies\ncite leadership a major problem and the percent that rate the problem \"urgent\"\nwent up to almost 2/3 of all respondents.\n\n![Fig 4: Leadership: generations, teams,\nscience](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAVHAAAAJDY0YzJhMjczLTc4MTEtNDRjOS1iZGE3LWZhMjAyMjRhODk4ZA.jpg)\n\nFig 4: Leadership: generations, teams, science\n\nWhy is leadership such an issue? Quite simply because the leaders we need\ntoday must be agile, they must learn fast, and they must be connected\nthroughout the organization. The customer service team, sales teams, or\nmarketing teams in your company are often led by mid-level leaders, many of\nwhich have grown up in the function. They must have hands-on leadership skills\nand they must both lead the team and interoperate across teams, a set of\nskills not always present in the old fashioned hierarchical organization.\n\nI had a meeting with the CEO of one of the fastest growing companies in India\nlast Fall and he put it clearly:\n\n> \"We have no room for 'general managers' any more. If our leaders aren't\n> functional, hands-on leaders, I don't need them around. Information flows\n> easily from team to team and city to city, I don't need managers in the\n> middle to generate reports and tell me when one team is behind or problems\n> are taking place.\"\n\nIn his case, the company is designing its business around digital information\ncenters, shared goals, and mobile platforms that help employees communicate\nand share information instantaneously. In most companies that kind of\ninfrastructure is just being built, so the shift from \"the hierarchy\" to \"the\nnetwork\" is very much a work in process.\n\nThe big change in leadership is the movement away from \"positional leadership\"\n(ie. I am the leader because I am the VP) to team leadership through\nexpertise, passion, energy, and empowerment.  Leaders in the new organization\nmust create \"followership\" - inspiring the team to perform, connecting the\nteam to the broader mission, and connecting teams to each other.\n\n**The Importance Of Culture And Engagement**\n\nOne of the biggest drivers and facilitators of the \"new organization\" is the\nneed to drive culture, employee engagement, learning, and feedback throughout\nthe company. The third and fourth most important trends were culture (86%\nrated important) and engagement (85% rated important).\n\nThis makes perfect sense. Millennials, [which now make up more than 50% of the\nworkforce](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/11/millennials-\nsurpass-gen-xers-as-the-largest-generation-in-u-s-labor-force/) (more in many\ncountries), are looking for mission and values at work, and when they work in\nsmall teams they need a shared culture to ensure that strategies, programs,\nand compliance takes place in a consistent way. Deloitte has done many studies\nof compliance programs, for example, which always show that building a\n\"culture of compliance\" is far more effective than giving people tools or\nprocesses to make sure they do as they are told.\n\n![Fig 5: Culture: key to strategy, execution, and\nalignment](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAOxAAAAJGE3YjBlM2M5LWViODAtNGFiOC04NTZkLTQ1NjU1YmUzYWVhYg.jpg)\n\nFig 5: Culture: key to strategy, execution, and alignment\n\nWhat is culture and how do you measure and manage it? This topic is on the\nminds of CEOs, investors, and business leaders around the world. The research\ntries to unlock the secret of building a high performing culture, and I would\nencourage you to read the section \"Shape Culture, Drive Strategy,\" or the\narticle \"[Why Culture is the Hottest Topic in\nBusiness](http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/03/13/culture-why-its-\nthe-hottest-topic-in-business-today/#da0065fb6e28)\" to understand ways to help\nyou define, monitor, and better align your culture.\n\nCoupled with culture, the topic of employee engagement continues to be urgent\nas well.\n\nAs Deloitte wrote about last year and I describe in the [Simply Irresistible\nOrganization](http://dupress.com/articles/employee-engagement-strategies/)\nresearch, we also know that employees today operate more like \"volunteers\"\nthan like indentured servants or \"employees.\" They are busy and often\n\"overwhelmed\" with work (read the article on [The Overwhelmed\nEmployee](http://www2.deloitte.com/au/en/pages/human-\ncapital/articles/overwhelmed-employee-simplify-environment.html) for more),\nthey are active on social networks (where they can browse for new jobs or\nreceive job offers), and they openly share information about your company and\ntheir boss. If they are not inspired and engaged at their work, they drift\naway and you may find yourself with a large organization operating with low\nperformance or inconsistent customer service.\n\n![Fig 6: Engagement: Always\nOn](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAb3AAAAJDhlZmFhYzNiLTJkOTYtNDM0Ni05MzUzLTFjYTMyNzgxNDQ0ZA.jpg)\n\nFig 6: Engagement: Always On\n\nThe issue with employee engagement today is that we have to build an \"always\non\" listening process, one the opens up streams of feedback and concerns in a\nway that helps leaders immediately spot problems and design solutions that\nmake employees more productive, aligned, and engaged at work.\n\nThis is a major thrend sweeping through HR departments around the world,\nbringing the world of I/O psychology, survey and feedback technology and\nPeople Analytics together. I recently talked with a large insurance company\nwho is looking at employee engagement data, pulse survey data, exit surveys,\nperformance ratings, and job mobility in an integrated new system. They expect\nthis new platform to give them immediate insights into operational problems\nthroughout the organization, help them design better employee benefits and\nreward systems, and identify management problems quicker than ever before.\n\nWhat is the relationship between Culture and Engagement?  While many vendors\nare mixing the words somewhat randomly, the research shows that they are\ndirectly linked, but not the same thing:\n\n![Fig 7: Culture vs.\nEngagement](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAVpAAAAJDA3MDRhZTJhLWJkNjktNDI3My05NTQyLWUxYjBlNTk3ZThjOQ.jpg)\n\nFig 7: Culture vs. Engagement\n\nIf you take the time to define and align your culture, you now have a set of\ntools to help measure and manage engagement. Together these new practices in\nHR give you a dashboard and set of alignment tools to make sure your \"network\nof teams\" is operating well around the world.\n\n**Learning: The New Fuel Of The Organization**\n\nThe topic of learning, which 84% of surveyed companies rated important,\n_increased in urgency by 10% over last year_.\n\nThe research shows two important shifts here:\n\n\u2022 First, today learning is \"owned by the employee,\" so companies have to\nprovide a rich set of learning experiences on the job, enabling employees to\ncontinuously train and educate themselves. The [adoption of MOOCs and advanced\nvideo learning more than doubled from\n2015](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/use-moocs-online-education-exploding-\nheres-why-josh-bersin), as the corporate training department shifts from one\nof \"education\" to one of \"building a learning experience\" at work.\n\n\u2022 Second, there is a major trend toward career development, professional\ndevelopment, and upskilling in the workforce. As I like to describe it, today\n\"The Learning Curve is the Earning Curve,\" and people now flock to companies\nthat can give them the opportunity to grow and\ndevelop.![uncaptioned](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAcBAAAAJGUyNjUzZjY1LTFjYTAtNGRjMS1iYWU5LWUyZmIxNzRhNDE4Mw.jpg)There\nis an urgent rush to skills around the world, forcing high performing\ncompanies to provide professional skills, technical education, and career\ndevelopment  in order to attract great people. Most major retailers, for\nexample, now offer tuition reimbursement for hourly workers and early career\nmanagement programs are becoming popular again.\n\n![Fig 8: Learning: Employees take\nCharge](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAWJAAAAJDg3NjFjMzliLTU3OWYtNGM0NS1hZGMzLTFmZmJkZTgzOGUyNA.jpg)\n\nFig 8: Learning: Employees take Charge\n\nIn today's \"network of teams\" organization, skills and capabilities are the\ncurrency of success.  The corporate learning industry is trying to adapt, as\nwe provide an \"always on,\" high fidelity learning experience through all\nphases of an employee's career.\n\n**Design Thinking Takes Center Stage**\n\nThis new organization, which empowers people through shared goals and a team-\ncentric structure, has to be _designed to help people get things done_. This\nis why the next trend identified is the huge interest and need for design\nthinking, in areas like HR, learning, performance management, and the entire\nwork experience.\n\n![Fig 9: Design thinking in HR: Crafting the Employee\nExperience](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAQ9AAAAJDdiYmJiZTcxLWIyODEtNDA3My1hZjVkLTg3NTdjYmEyZTY5Ng.jpg)\n\nFig 9: Design thinking in HR: Crafting the Employee Experience\n\nAs Deloitte wrote about recently in the article \"[HR for\nHumans](http://dupress.com/articles/behavioral-economics-evidence-based-hr-\nmanagement/),\" people today don't just \"do what's best for them\" at work -\nthey behave as humans, and we need to make work simpler, easier, and more\ndevelopmental in every way. This leads to a whole new way of designing HR,\nlearning, and talent programs - based on simplicity, a focus on only what's\nimportant, the use of mobile apps, and a core of user-centric design. The old\ndays of building an end-to-end process for recruiting, onboarding, performance\nmanagement, or career development are going away. Now we look at each\nemployee's role in the company and we design \"curated experiences\" that help\nthem learn and progress.\n\n**A New Model For Management**\n\nCoupled with the change in organizational structure and talent practices is\n_major shift in management thinking_.  Every decade or so we rethink how\nmanagement works, and right now we are entering a new era.\n\nToday, as the chart below illustrates, we no longer think of executives as\n\"kings,\" but rather as facilitators, strategists, and team leaders who can\ninspire and empower teams to succeed. This new concept, which has become\nfundamental to management books and practices over the last few years, is\ncoming from a realization that the old fashioned, hierarchical leadership\nmodels just don't work today.\n\n![Fig 10: The Evolution of Management\nThinking](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAVWAAAAJDQ0MzBkYTQwLTdiZmEtNDFlOC04NTIzLWVjZmI3MjY3YTY0OA.gif)\n\nFig 10: The Evolution of Management Thinking\n\nThere are many implications of this shift: what high performing leaders do,\nwho we promote to top leadership, and how we design reward and alignment\nsystems to help leaders contribute.  But the biggest symptom of this change is\nthe enormous trend to reinvent performance management.\n\nPeople keep asking me \"how should we reinvent _performance_ management?\" and\nwhat I tell them is \"think about how you want to reinvent _management_!\"\n\nThe old fashioned once-per-year annual review is going away, to be replaced\nwith a more open, transparent, \"always-on\" process. Deloitte [research\nshows](http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/human-\ncapital/articles/performance-management-redesign-human-capital-\ntrends-2015.html) that over 70% of companies are simplifying the process, and\nthere is a dramatic shift away from \"forced ranking\" and \"numeric ratings\"\ntoward programs to facilitate feedback, encourage coaching, and evaluate\npeople on contributions broader than their individual numeric or project\ngoals.\n\nAs leaders of teams and networks, we have to promote practices that bring\npeople together, help people develop, and also focus on topics like onboarding\n(people change teams regularly), work-life balance, career transition\nmanagement, and wellness. These practices of HR are hot growth areas today\nbecause companies are realizing that if we can't help people operate in the\nteam, transition from team to team, and stay healthy - we can't perform as a\nbusiness.\n\n**Do Away With The Organization Chart: Help People Build Careers**\n\nOne may ask, does this \" _New Organization: Different by Design_ ,\" even need\nan org chart?  Of course people need to know how the company is organized, who\nis in charge of what, and where to go for information and decisions.\n\nBut as the research shows more and more, the days of the \"org chart\" are\nstarting to disappear, because the organization itself operates more like a\nsports team or consulting firm, and less like a top-down bureaucracy than ever\nbefore. What we really need today is a \"network analysis\" of the company ([the\ndiscipline is called\nONA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_network_analysis)) that\ntells us who to call for what, regardless of where they work.  (I believe\nOrganizational Network Analysis is an important new trend and a valuable tool\nfor HR and management as we learn to manage in the network model.)\n\nLet me give you an example. A large, well-known technology company recently\nspent a day with Deloitte to help redesign their programs for career\ndevelopment, in their quest to change their culture toward that of innovation,\ncreativity, and technical excellence. They found, after talking for several\nhours, that one of the biggest obstacles in the way was \"job titles\" and \"job\nlevels.\" The company had developed such a culture of \"up or out\" that people\nwere unable to move to important new roles (many of which were very strategic)\nbecause they felt they were not \"promotions\" and it would not \"improve their\nlevel.\"\n\nThis kind of thinking, which we have institutionalized around the world for\ndecades, has to go away. In today's digital workplace the value of an\nindividual can be enormous, as long as they have the skills, passion, and\nnetwork connections to do what is needed. Why would we penalize or hold back\nsomeone's ability to grow by telling them that only by moving \"up\" can you\nprogress in the company?\n\nDeloitte decided after this workshop that the whole idea of a \"[HIPO (high\npotential)](http://www.bersin.com/Lexicon/Details.aspx?id=12845)\" is now\nobsolete, and we have to empower everyone to grow through lateral projects and\nroles, continuous development, and challenging assignments. Yes there will be\nlevels, but maybe we only need 5 or 6 in the company, not the 30-40 detailed\nlevels they have today.\n\n**Growth In People Analytics and Emergence Of Digital HR**\n\nWhich gets me to the final two trends:  the emergence of People Analytics and\nwhat Deloitte calls  _Digital HR_.  People Analytics, a discipline that was\nlabelled \"stuck in neutral\" last year, has started to take off. The maturity\nof this discipline doubled this year, and while there is still much work to\ndo, this has become a major new discipline within HR and business.\n\n![Fig 12: People Analytics: Gaining\nSpeed](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAATbAAAAJDc1MDUxZTllLTRjNWEtNDAzZS1hMmFiLWFiN2YzZjg4NjQyOA.jpg)\n\nFig 12: People Analytics: Gaining Speed\n\nMy experience with analytics, after many years in this market, is that we have\nhit the \"knee in the curve\" and growth will greatly accelerate this year.  If\nyou're interested in this space, please read the chapter People Analytics:\nGaining Speed or look through the article \"[Ten Things I've Learned in People\nAnalytics](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-takes-off-ten-\nthings-weve-learned-josh-bersin).\"\n\nDeloitte couldn't write this report without taking a hard look at HR\ntechnology as a whole. As it looked across all the management, structural,\ntalent, and leadership issues companies face, it found that HR is going\nthrough a digital disruption of its own. While cloud computing has radically\nchanged the way we buy HR software and develop HR platforms, an even bigger\nchange is happening in the way we design and build HR solutions.\n\nDigital HR, as Deloitte decided to call it, is a new focus on building HR\nsolutions that are experiential, designed for mobile apps, and built through\ndesign thinking and behavioral economics to help people get work done. We are\nshifting HR's focus away from \"process and programs\" toward \"strategies and\nsolutions\" that help people get work done. This means HR departments have to\nunderstand and learn how to build feedback, coaching, goal setting, and\ndevelopment programs that look and feel like apps, are easy to use, and fit\ninto the context of work.\n\n![Fig 13: Digital HR: Revolution not\nEvolution](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAQsAAAAJGUwY2RjOWQzLWIzN2QtNGU4Yy1iZTJjLTg4OWUxZGYyNWVjNQ.jpg)\n\nFig 13: Digital HR: Revolution not Evolution\n\nDigital HR is not only a way to leverage new technology, it is really the next\nwave in our efforts to facilitate the new world of work. It's a new way of\nbuilding HR solutions, driven by analytics and behavioral economics,\nreflecting the new model of work, new roles of leaders, and the way people now\nwork together in a peer to peer basis. Deloitte developed a set of case\nstudies in the research, and it will be talking much more about this new world\nin the coming months.\n\n**The New Organization: Designed For Us As People**\n\nAs I reflect on the hard work Deloitte did to complete this research and\nunderstand the findings, I\u2019m left with one final thought. The new organization\nwe identify and describe in this research is not just an artifact of\ntechnology, disruptive change, or the demanding needs of Millennials.\n\nIt's more than that - it\u2019s a shift away from \"corporations as institutions\" to\n\"businesses as collections of people:\" designed to operate the way we as\npeople like to work.\n\nThe new organization and talent models described are not just trendy, they're\nnatural to us as people. I've found many studies which show that we as humans\nlike to communicate, collaborate, and operate in small groups. We are\nessentially tribal animals, and we like to be part of something bigger than\nourselves, connected locally to people we like, respect, and can enjoy.\n([Google just published its research on\nteams](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-\nits-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0) and it shows that we operate\nbest when the organization builds trust, respect, and inclusion.)\n\nThe 1960's organization, which looked like a hierarchy or an industrial\ninstitution, with executives who have private parking spaces, executive\nwashrooms, and thickly carpeted offices at the top of the building with\nexpansive views, is becoming a dinosaur. Yes executives will always like power\nand luxury to compensate them for their hard work - but today if they want to\nsucceed they must learn how to tap into the power of every individual, every\nteam, and figure out how to bring the network of teams together, aligned to\nfulfill on the needs of customers and the organization as a whole.\n\nThink about who really \"runs\" your company: generally, retail companies are\nrun by store managers; sales teams are run by sales leaders; consumer goods\ncompanies are led by product leaders; consulting teams are led by strong\nconsultants; manufacturing companies are run by plant managers; and software\nand technology companies are led by engineers. If you come to grips with the\npotential to empower teams, make the teams work, and bring the teams together\n- you'll find that your company, regardless of how large or small it may be,\ncan flourish and grow like never before. It's human nature for us to love our\nwork if we \"own it\" - so part of this new organization is to let every person\n\"own their work\" and contribute in their own special way.\n\nThis research identifies new models to drive performance, employee engagement,\nand business growth in every industry. The ten trends identified: structure,\nleadership, culture, engagement, learning, design thinking, Digital HR,\nanalytics, and workforce management - come together to serve as a roadmap for\nyour organization's journey into the future.\n\nI recommend you read this report in detail, give Deloitte your feedback, and\nlet's talk about these issues in the coming year. The digital world of work is\nhere, and our ability to build this \"new organization, different by design\" is\nmore important than ever for all of us.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/Josh_Bersin) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bersin).

Often, I\nface an awkward situation when my juniors approach me for guidance on\nassignments which I have not been informed about. I am tolerating this\nunpleasant situation for the last five years. When I took my grievance to my\nboss, he said he is not answerable to me. The management appears helpless.\nThis is frustrating as my chances of getting promoted are being blocked. What\nshall I do?  \n**Rituparna Chakraborty:** This is indeed a difficult spot to be in, and more\nso because you have been in this position for the last five years. I assume\nthat in these five years, neither you nor your superior have been promoted.\nProfessionally, that is a huge red flag. Before getting into issues which seem\nto indicate breeding of insecurity, I would be concerned about working under\nsomeone who is not progressing in his career. Your acceptance of the situation\nfor five years amounts to professional hara-kiri.  \nThe focus should not be around what your superior should or could do, as\ntrying to change his behaviour may not amount to much. What is equally\nworrisome is that the management seems toothless or lacks a transparent\nperformance mechanism. Is your superior so indispensable that the management\nhas no other option but to look away? Given that both of you seem to be stuck\nin the same role, it doesn\u2019t seem so.  \nThe final issue is around your inability to guide your subordinates, again, on\naccount of your superior.  \nYou should attempt the following:  \n**A.** Make an effort to figure out the reason for your superior\u2019s insecurity.\nTake independent feedback from your superior\u2019s peers and the HR department on\nwhat could be possible reasons. Make use of performance management discussions\nfor insights into why your boss is bypassing you.  \n**B.** Be self-aware and honest about your performance. Document your\nachievements or gaps, which might have caused your superior to lose trust in\nyou. Working on these aspects proactively can help approach the situation\ndifferently and could elicit a response from your superiors.  \n**C.** Apply to internal job postings (if such an option or policy exists), or\npitch for a new role under a different leader. Consider this only after\noptions A and B have been exhausted. This will help you explore newer\nopportunities within the same organisation and give you a chance to grow.  \nIf all the options fail, it\u2019s perhaps time to relook at whether you want to\ncontinue working in such an organisation. More so because you have given this\nissue more time than it deserves.  \nHowever, it would be good to address your inability to help subordinates or\nguide them, irrespective of the behaviour of your superior towards you. You\ncould continue to command the respect of your team by successfully\nestablishing yourself as a leader whom they can trust and learn from. It would\nbe good to reflect on this and work towards mending ways for the future.  \n_Rituparna Chakraborty is executive vice-president & co-founder at TeamLease\nServices_  \n**\u2018HOW DO I GET MY JUNIORS TO WORK THE WAY I WANT?\u2019  \n\n![#](/img/73328156/Master.jpg)\n\n**  \n**Q:** We are a proprietorship firm of 10 employees. The expectation from each\nexecutive is high, which is sometimes resented. For instance, when a woman\nemployee was given additional responsibility, she refused to oblige, saying\nshe was not \"qualified and experienced enough\". Even in areas of her\nexpertise, she has declined to chip in. In another case, a male marketing\nexecutive\u2019s performance has been below par. When he was transferred to another\ncity, he refused to go, citing personal reasons. Being a small organisation,\nwe are facing difficulty getting work done. What should we do?  \n**Sujaya Banerjee:** I am sure your experience is shared by many small-sized\norganisations and startups.  \nThe situation you have described is a classic chicken and egg story: Unless\nthe organisation builds the scale of business and an attractive brand, there\nare challenges of getting high quality talent. Also, unless it learns to build\nboth capacity and capability, it is unable to create scale/growth.  \nHere are some perspectives on managing teams for performance that can help you\nride through this phase:  \n**Hiring the right talent** This is perhaps the most important decision you\u2019ll\nmake when you run a small company. Do not presume you cannot attract good\ntalent because you are a 10-member proprietorship. Hire for attitude and train\nfor capabilities on the job. If someone claims to have the expertise or\nexperience, put it to test and use a few psychometrics easily available like\nFIRO-B (Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation-Behaviour) to ensure\nyou are not bringing in toxic or uncooperative people. Verify the CV of\ncandidates and ensure you are hiring people with hunger for learning who can\nbe groomed.  \n**Not high on hierarchy** Ensure your organisation\u2019s structure allows newbies\nto be mentored by seniors. Do not create too many levels in a small team. Your\ncompany must have a supervisor, who is a \u2018\u2018go-to person\u2019\u2019 when the CEO/leader\nis not available. Ground rules for teamwork: Since small organisations have\nfewer people, there can be misunderstanding. Keep communication channels open.\nWhat do you expect from the team? What is not acceptable? Create an\nenvironment of direct talk and recognition.  \n**Be a role model** If you want a certain work ethic, set an example. If the\nleadership is lackadaisical and unclear, which keeps changing its\nexpectations, it becomes difficult to get small teams to move in the same\ndirection.  \nNow let\u2019s come to the specific cases you have mentioned. The first one relates\nto the woman executive who is unable to demonstrate flexibility. This seems to\nbe an attitude issue which must be recognised and weeded out. Having a\nreputation for being uncooperative is a red-flag and requires a tough-love\nconversation immediately. These conversations help define boundaries and help\nin turning around performances. You may find opportunities to counsel and\nchange your perspective, if you listen to their perspective. If they don\u2019t\nimprove, the individual must not be surprised by the consequences of not\nchanging his/her behaviour.  \nLet\u2019s move to the marketing executive who is refusing to be relocated. Is his\njob transferable? If he is citing personal reasons, they may be genuine. If\nhis performance is not up to the mark in one region, changing the location may\nnot be of any use till you have addressed the real issue. Often, there are\ninadequate orientations to new jobs \u2014 weak mechanisms to train. There is a\ntendency to presume people have done similar roles in the past so don\u2019t need\nhand-holding. Do review his reasons for non-performance in this context, and\nmake appropriate decisions to allow him to transition out if he is unable to\nperform.  \nAs a small proprietorship, it is imperative to manage these transitions well\nto maintain the morale of those who are still working in the team. Those who\ncannot cope with your team norms of working together or do not share your work\nethic, should be asked to leave.  \nAnd finally, getting work done is an outcome of clarity and our own\ndemonstrated work ethic. Small organisations need the manager to lead from the\nfront, work the hardest, be most motivated to create an environment of purpose\nand pull everyone in the team in the same direction. Every member needs\ndifferent handling and that cannot be wished away or left unattended. Positive\ncontributions are not an outcome of chance but must be nurtured with fairness,\ntough love and mentoring.  \n_Sujaya Banerjee is CEO, Capstone People Consulting.

After I informed the head of my department about my\npregnancy, the HR personnel called me for a meeting to discuss \u201cfinancial\nproblems\u201d faced by the company. I was told there is an urgent need to\ndownsize. As part of a restructuring, my post was eliminated and I was asked\nto resign with a month\u2019s notice under the contract. To me, this clearly\nappears to be a decision driven by my pregnancy. This has caused a great deal\nof anxiety. Please advise what I should do to safeguard my career.  \n**Saundarya Rajesh:** First, let me congratulate you on your pregnancy \u2014\nlife\u2019s most beautiful moment. You will relish this phase throughout your life.\nNo doubt, it is a demanding period too \u2014 physically, emotionally and\nfinancially. As a career-intentional woman professional, it is important that\nyou navigate this phase strategically \u2014 your physical and mental well-being\ntaking prominence. Your concerns at the workplace are not misplaced.\nUnfortunately, maternity discrimination is prevalent in organisations which\nare not high on diversity. Several women have been victims of maternity bias.\nIn the absence of leadership conviction to make workplaces inclusive,\nunconscious biases sometimes drive business decisions.  \nLet us now break down your problem for greater clarity. Your pregnancy\nannouncement was shortly followed by an HR communication that they are\ndissolving your position. If the world was just black and white, this would be\na case of ruthless discrimination. Section 12 of Maternity Benefit Act 1961\nstates, \u201cIt is unlawful for the employer to dismiss, terminate or change the\nconditions of service to the disadvantage of a woman during the pregnancy\nperiod.\u201d According to the Act, to be eligible for maternity benefit, a woman\nmust have been working as an employee in an establishment for at least 80 days\nin the past 12 months. This is applicable for consultants working on contracts\nas well.  \nIn 2017, when the government amended key guidelines in the Maternity Benefits\nAct to increase the period of paid maternity leave to 26 weeks from 12 weeks,\nthere was a sharp spike in the number of complaints of women being denied\nmaternity benefits. The National Commission for Women (NCW) received several\ncomplaints from working women.  \nThere are various hues even in a well-oiled business set-up. As for\norganisations that are just setting sail, people decisions are a function of\nvarious market complexities. So it is important that you gather further\ncontext to the situation at hand. I strongly urge that you challenge this and\nhave a conversation with the HR team and your department head. However, I\nwould also like you to be objective when you challenge an organisational\ndecision.  \nFirst, find out the extent of current financial challenges of your employer to\nbuild your case. What is the rationale behind dissolving your post? Are there\nsimilar positions that have been eliminated in the company? If the answers to\nthese questions point towards a market-responsive business decision of re-\npurposing certain roles, you need to initiate a discussion with your\ndepartment head, where you demonstrate your interest in moving to a different\nrole. Of course, you will also have to back this up with evidence of your own\nperformance over the last seven months.  \nBe aware of taking a very hard stand when you are managing a heady cocktail of\nhormones. Pregnancy is an emotional roller-coaster ride and so, don\u2019t burn\nbridges. When you are armed with objectivity, I believe the chances for things\ngoing well are higher.  \nIf you find that the intent to push for separation from the company is due to\nyour pregnancy, you have two options.  \n**1)** You can file a complaint with the labour commission. Please maintain\nrecords that establish that you have been a productive and effective employee,\nincluding projects worked on with timelines, appreciation for the work that\nyou have received from clients, colleagues or managers, etc. Also, it will be\na good idea to take legal advice from a lawyer who specialises in labour laws.\nIt is important to take care of your physical and mental health during this\ntime. So, speak to your doctor transparently about this situation and if\nrequired, seek counselling/professional help to manage your anxiety.  \n**2)** If the decision is one based on unreasonable discrimination and the\ndiscussions did not help, it is then time to move on. Pause and reflect, while\nyou actually enjoy your pregnancy. There are several role model organisations\nin the country whose diversity commitment is public and work practices\nexceptionally inclusive. These are organisations where mothers, returning\nafter maternity, thrive and grow. Seek the help of your mentors, leverage the\npower of your networks, hang out with your peer moms, to get to where you\nought to be.  \n_Saundarya Rajesh is founder president of Avtar, a leading firm on workplace\ninclusion & belongingness._  \n**\u2018I\u2019M TREATED AS PUPPET IN STARTUP DESPITE MY 20-YEAR EXPERIENCE\u2019  \n  \n\n![#](/img/73328209/Master.jpg)\n\n**  \n**Q:** With nearly 20 years of experience, I joined a well-funded startup over\ntwo years ago as a business development manager. The startup initially\nprovided me with a good platform with international travel. I was also\nappreciated for productivity, but without an appraisal for two years.\nSuddenly, one day the management assigned me the night shift-based lead\ngeneration role out of India. The reporting executive (eight years younger\nthan me with a higher salary and work-from-home option) treated me as his\npuppet and did not allow me to take control of the sales process. I have been\ngiven just a 5% hike with the management saying that my international travel\nand the costs associated were part of my appraisal. The demotion has been\ndemoralising. I applied to several companies but haven't got a positive\nresponse. Please help.  \n**Abhijit Bhaduri:** Children in the early years of school are often asked\nwhat they wish to be when they grow up. Startups are often like those\nchildren. They may start with an idea and as they build it, they may change\ncourse. Market conditions are dynamic. That may throw the startup\u2019s initial\nplans into disarray. When startups get funding (like your employer has),\ninvestors often exercise influence over many decisions. This leads to changes\nin the product, the sales strategy and impacts deliverable timelines.  \nOn the ground, sometimes, employees in a startup are caught up in chaos. The\nproject they worked on for a while may get shelved abruptly. An abandoned\nproject may need to be put on the fast track. People who enjoy working in this\nkind of ambiguity leverage their adaptability to thrive in such environments.\nIt can be stressful, especially if the frequency of changes is more than what\nyou can handle. Self-awareness is often the first step for being satisfied\nwith your career choices.  \nIn many established organisations, the product may already have a market and a\npaid client base. Such organisations are more structured and predictable. I\nassume your 20 years of experience have been spent in relatively more\nestablished organisations. Life in a startup must seem chaotic in comparison.  \nIn the first two years, you have had exposure to sales and been exposed to\nglobal markets. The monetary compensation (e.g., increments) are as much a\npart of the total rewards as the travel, exposure and investment in education\nby the employer. It is a \u201ccost to company\u201d (CTC). Increments need not be\nannual and certainly cannot be claimed as an entitlement. It is discretionary.  \nReporting to someone younger is hurting your ego. Get over that mindset. It is\narchaic. You may have team members who had more experience or better\nqualifications than you. The work output is what matters. The years of\nexperience and qualifications have limited value in the job market after a few\nyears. The same goes for credentials. When a song becomes a hit, we do not\ncare how old the singer is and whether he/she holds a degree in music.\nEmployers are no different.  \nWorking from home is not a perk anymore. So if you feel that you would like to\nbe a remote worker, you too can ask for it. More importantly, you must set up\na meeting with your boss to understand how he/she wishes to review progress\nand the kind of metrics that matter. You must state how you would like to\noperate. Suggest that you try the arrangement for two weeks and then tweak it\ntill both of you are comfortable. Being resentful of your boss\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d is\nonly going to hurt the relationship.  \nYou may want to think about whether you are more comfortable with a little\nmore predictability. In which case, choose your next employer accordingly.  \n_Abhijit Bhaduri is a digital transformation coach who advises organisations\non the Future of Work  \n  \n _ _AdWise is a column that addresses workplace-related matters and appears\nevery alternate Thursday in TOI.

Most commenters agreed. Quite naturally, a few wondered where to put\nthat responsibility. I did hint at a federated approach, though I provided no\ndetails whatsoever. Here I provide a few. In particular, I find people\nmanagement provides a good model for getting started.\n\nThe feature of people management that strikes me most is how the work is split\nup and gets everyone involved. Human Resources groups have many line\nresponsibilities of their own, such as succession planning, setting pay\nscales, and selecting the benefits package. They also work with other\ndepartments to help hire and train the human capabilities they need. That\nsaid, most people management is actually done in the course of day-in, day-out\nwork, by managers and employees. HR may very well define the semiannual\nperformance review process, provide the needed forms, and make sure it is\ncarried out. But performance assessment is completed by employees and\nmanagers.\n\nThis last point strikes at the heart of the federated model. Corporate HR sets\npolicy; department HR may modify it in accordance with specific needs; and\ndepartments, managers, and employees carry out these policies. Most have a\ncertain degree of latitude in how they do so.\n\nWhat does the division of work suggest for data? As with people management,\nmost of the work to create, store, manipulate, use, and deliver data to\ncustomers is conducted by people within processes and departments, and they\nmust be fully engaged. Practically everyone is both a data creator and\ncustomer. This is where the real work of managing data and putting it to work\nlies. And it is where much responsibility for data must lie.\n\nCorporate and departmental data groups (DGs) should set and administer policy\nthat help individuals, processes, and departments understand and meet these\nresponsibilities to high standards. For example, a data quality policy must\ndictate that data creators create data in accordance with the needs of those\nwho use the data and that data customers clarify those needs.\n\nIn addition to its policy-setting role, the corporate DG has at least two\ncritical functions all its own. Some data are of special importance because\nthey are uniquely the company\u2019s own, providing potential for sustained\ncompetitive advantage. The corporate DG has a special role in identifying,\nprotecting, and enriching these data.\n\nThe corporate DG must also own the end-to-end metadata processes. It is easy\nto dismiss metadata as so much technical arcana, but some metadata, including\ndata definitions, data models, some standards, provenance, and usage\nrestrictions, can be extremely important. Done well, metadata makes it easier\nto for everyone else to understand, trust, and share data.\n\nDepartmental DGs help their assigned department acquire and/or create the\nvariety and depth of data they need. They may work directly with external\nsuppliers, measure quality levels against policy dictates, lead improvement\nprojects, and help qualify data-enabling technologies.\n\nIn some companies, high-powered data scientists, architects, and others report\ninto such departmental DGs. This is most appropriate when analytic work should\nbe \u201cclose to, but not in the line.\u201d In other companies ([and as I\u2019ve\nadvised](/cs/2012/05/building_data_discovery_into_y.html)), those seeking to\nmake industry-changing discoveries should organize their data scientists away\nfrom the line, in their equivalent of a \u201claboratory.\u201d\n\nClearly, there is a lot of work to be done. Based on quality management in\nmanufacturing, the efforts of leading data companies, what worked at the great\n[Bell Laboratories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs), and the utility\nof the HR model, my current best guess is that about 2% of a leading company\u2019s\nemployee base will report into a corporate DG, departmental DGs, and the data\nlab. While [data scientists](/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-\nthe-21st-century/ar/1) attract the most attention, people in a variety of\nspecialties, including quality, modeling, architecture, data management\ntechnologies, and some we\u2019ve yet to label, will be needed.\n\nTaken together, these points represent a sea change in thinking, particularly\nfor those whose most senior data person is a technical architect, buried [deep\nin the bowels of IT](/cs/2012/10/get_responsiblity_for_data_out.html). This\nwill not do. Just as the head of HR is among the top few people in a company,\ndata requires very senior leadership. Fueled in part by the advances of big\ndata, a full-scale data revolution is brewing. People and organizations are\nbeginning to more fully appreciate that all data, not just big data, are\nassets of enormous potential. Accelerating that understanding, building the\nneeded organizational capabilities discussed here, and focusing the effort is\nan important job and motivates the call for a true C-level Chief Data Officer.\n\nI think many will find the 2% figure, indeed, this entire post, shocking. And\nafter they reflect, I hope they realize just how urgently these subjects\ndemand attention. In times of great change, fortune favors the bold.

What if a company were\nto launch dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of agile teams? Could whole\nsegments of the business learn to operate in this manner?\n\nAs enticing as such a prospect is, turning it into a reality can be\nchallenging. Companies often struggle to know which functions should be\nreorganized into multidisciplinary agile teams and which should not. And it's\nnot unusual to launch dozens of new agile teams only to see them bottlenecked\nby slow-moving bureaucracies.\n\nThe authors, who have studied the scaling of agile at hundreds of companies,\nshare what they've learned about how to do it effectively. Leaders should use\nagile methodologies themselves and create a taxonomy of opportunities to set\npriorities and break the journey into small steps. Workstreams should be\nmodularized and then seamlessly integrated. Functions not reorganized into\nagile teams should learn to operate with agile values. And the annual\nbudgeting process should be complemented with a VC-like approach to funding.\n\n#### In Brief\n\n##### The Ambition\n\nTo go from a handful of agile innovation teams in a function like software\ndevelopment to scores, even hundreds, throughout your company\u2014to make agile\nthe dominant way you operate\n\n##### The Challenges\n\nFiguring out where to start and how fast and far to go, deciding which\nfunctions can and should be converted to agile teams and which should not, and\npreventing slow-moving bureaucracies from impeding those that do convert\n\n##### The Solution\n\nLeaders should use agile methods themselves and create a _taxonomy of\nopportunities_ to set priorities and break the journey into small steps.\nWorkstreams should be modularized and then seamlessly integrated. Functions\nnot reorganized into agile teams should learn to operate with agile values.\nThe annual budgeting process should be complemented with a VC-like approach to\nfunding.\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2018/05/agile-at-scale?language=es)\n\nBy now most business leaders are familiar with agile innovation teams. These\nsmall, entrepreneurial groups are designed to stay close to customers and\nadapt quickly to changing conditions. When implemented correctly, they almost\nalways result in higher team productivity and morale, faster time to market,\nbetter quality, and lower risk than traditional approaches can achieve.\n\nNaturally, leaders who have experienced or heard about agile teams are asking\nsome compelling questions. What if a company were to launch dozens, hundreds,\nor even thousands of agile teams throughout the organization? Could whole\nsegments of the business learn to operate in this manner? Would scaling up\nagile improve corporate performance as much as agile methods improve\nindividual team performance?\n\nIn today\u2019s tumultuous markets, where established companies are furiously\nbattling assaults from start-ups and other insurgent competitors, the prospect\nof a fast-moving, adaptive organization is highly appealing. But as enticing\nas such a vision is, turning it into a reality can be challenging. Companies\noften struggle to know which functions should be reorganized into\nmultidisciplinary agile teams and which should not. And it\u2019s not unusual to\nlaunch hundreds of new agile teams only to see them bottlenecked by slow-\nmoving bureaucracies.\n\nWe have studied the scaling up of agile at hundreds of companies, including\nsmall firms that run the entire enterprise with agile methods; larger\ncompanies that, like Spotify and Netflix, were born agile and have become more\nso as they\u2019ve grown; and companies that, like Amazon and USAA (the financial\nservices company for the military community), are making the transition from\ntraditional hierarchies to more-agile enterprises. Along with the many success\nstories are some disappointments. For example, one prominent industrial\ncompany\u2019s attempts over the past five years to innovate like a lean start-up\nhave not yet generated the financial results sought by activist investors and\nthe board of directors, and several senior executives recently resigned.\n\nOur studies show that companies can scale up agile effectively and that doing\nso creates substantial benefits. But leaders must be realistic. Not every\nfunction needs to be organized into agile teams; indeed, agile methods aren\u2019t\nwell suited to some activities. Once you begin launching dozens or hundreds of\nagile teams, however, you can\u2019t just leave the other parts of the business\nalone. If your newly agile units are constantly frustrated by bureaucratic\nprocedures or a lack of collaboration between operations and innovation teams,\nsparks will fly from the organizational friction, leading to meltdowns and\npoor results. Changes are necessary to ensure that the functions that don\u2019t\noperate as agile teams support the ones that do.\n\n## Leading Agile by Being Agile\n\nFor anyone who isn\u2019t familiar with agile, here\u2019s a short review. Agile teams\nare best suited to innovation\u2014that is, the profitable application of\ncreativity to improve products and services, processes, or business models.\nThey are small and multidisciplinary. Confronted with a large, complex\nproblem, they break it into modules, develop solutions to each component\nthrough rapid prototyping and tight feedback loops, and integrate the\nsolutions into a coherent whole. They place more value on adapting to change\nthan on sticking to a plan, and they hold themselves accountable for outcomes\n(such as growth, profitability, and customer loyalty), not outputs (such as\nlines of code or number of new products).\n\nConditions are ripe for agile teams in any situation where problems are\ncomplex, solutions are at first unclear, project requirements are likely to\nchange, close collaboration with end users is feasible, and creative teams\nwill outperform command-and-control groups. Routine operations such as plant\nmaintenance, purchasing, and accounting are less fertile ground. Agile methods\ncaught on first in IT departments and are now widely used in software\ndevelopment. Over time they have spread into functions such as product\ndevelopment, marketing, and even HR. (See [\u201cEmbracing\nAgile,\u201d](/2016/05/embracing-agile) HBR, May 2016, and [\u201cHR Goes\nAgile,\u201d](/2018/03/hr-goes-agile) HBR, March\u2013April 2018.)\n\n#### This article also appears in:\n\n  * ![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/11/10357_500.png)\n\n###### [ Agile: The Insights You Need from\nHBR](https://store.hbr.org/product/agile-the-insights-you-need-from-harvard-\nbusiness-review/10357?referral=02560)\n\nTechnology & Operations Book\n\n22.95 Add to Cart\n\n    * __Save\n    * __Share\n\nAgile teams work differently from chain-of-command bureaucracies. They are\nlargely self-governing: Senior leaders tell team members where to innovate but\nnot how. And the teams work closely with customers, both external and\ninternal. Ideally, this puts responsibility for innovation in the hands of\nthose who are closest to customers. It reduces layers of control and approval,\nthereby speeding up work and increasing the teams\u2019 motivation. It also frees\nup senior leaders to do what only they can do: create and communicate long-\nterm visions, set and sequence strategic priorities, and build the\norganizational capabilities to achieve those goals.\n\nWhen leaders haven\u2019t themselves understood and adopted agile approaches, they\nmay try to scale up agile the way they have attacked other change initiatives:\nthrough top-down plans and directives. The track record is better when they\nbehave like an agile team. That means viewing various parts of the\norganization as their customers\u2014people and groups whose needs differ, are\nprobably misunderstood, and will evolve as agile takes hold. The executive\nteam sets priorities and sequences opportunities to improve those customers\u2019\nexperiences and increase their success. Leaders plunge in to solve problems\nand remove constraints rather than delegate that work to subordinates. The\nagile leadership team, like any other agile team, has an \u201cinitiative owner\u201d\nwho is responsible for overall results and a facilitator who coaches team\nmembers and helps keep everyone actively engaged.\n\nBosch, a leading global supplier of technology and services with more than\n400,000 associates and operations in 60-plus countries, took this approach. As\nleaders began to see that traditional top-down management was no longer\neffective in a fast-moving, globalized world, the company became an early\nadopter of agile methods. But different business areas required different\napproaches, and Bosch\u2019s first attempt to implement what it called a \u201cdual\norganization\u201d\u2014one in which hot new businesses were run with agile teams while\ntraditional functions were left out of the action\u2014compromised the goal of a\nholistic transformation. In 2015 members of the board of management, led by\nCEO Volkmar Denner, decided to build a more unified approach to agile teams.\nThe board acted as a steering committee and named Felix Hieronymi, a software\nengineer turned agile expert, to guide the effort.\n\nAt first Hieronymi expected to manage the assignment the same way Bosch\nmanaged most projects: with a goal, a target completion date, and regular\nstatus reports to the board. But that approach felt inconsistent with agile\nprinciples, and the company\u2019s divisions were just too skeptical of yet another\ncentrally organized program. So the team shifted gears. \u201cThe steering\ncommittee turned into a working committee,\u201d Hieronymi told us. \u201cThe\ndiscussions got far more interactive.\u201d The team compiled and rank-ordered a\nbacklog of corporate priorities that was regularly updated, and it focused on\nsteadily removing companywide barriers to greater agility. Members fanned out\nto engage division leaders in dialogue. \u201cStrategy evolved from an annual\nproject to a continuous process,\u201d Hieronymi says. \u201cThe members of the\nmanagement board divided themselves into small agile teams and tested various\napproaches\u2014some with a \u2018product owner\u2019 and an \u2018agile master\u2019\u2014to tackle tough\nproblems or work on fundamental topics. One group, for instance, drafted the\n10 new leadership principles released in 2016. They personally experienced the\nsatisfaction of increasing speed and effectiveness. You can\u2019t gain this\nexperience by reading a book.\u201d Today Bosch operates with a mix of agile teams\nand traditionally structured units. But it reports that nearly all areas have\nadopted agile values, are collaborating more effectively, and are adapting\nmore quickly to increasingly dynamic marketplaces.\n\n## Getting Agile Rolling\n\nAt Bosch and other advanced agile enterprises, the visions are ambitious. In\nkeeping with agile principles, however, the leadership team doesn\u2019t plan every\ndetail in advance. Leaders recognize that they do not yet know how many agile\nteams they will require, how quickly they should add them, and how they can\naddress bureaucratic constraints without throwing the organization into chaos.\nSo they typically launch an initial wave of agile teams, gather data on the\nvalue those teams create and the constraints they face, and then decide\nwhether, when, and how to take the next step. This lets them weigh the value\nof increasing agility (in terms of financial results, customer outcomes, and\nemployee performance) against its costs (in terms of both financial\ninvestments and organizational challenges). If the benefits outweigh the\ncosts, leaders continue to scale up agile\u2014deploying another wave of teams,\nunblocking constraints in less agile parts of the organization, and repeating\nthe cycle. If not, they can pause, monitor the market environment, and explore\nways to increase the value of the agile teams already in place (for instance,\nby improving the prioritization of work or upgrading prototyping capabilities)\nand decrease the costs of change (by publicizing agile successes or hiring\nexperienced agile enthusiasts).\n\n#### This article also appears in:\n\n  * ![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/11/10296_500.png)\n\n###### [HBR\u2019s 10 Must Reads 2020](https://store.hbr.org/product/hbr-s-10-must-\nreads-2020-the-definitive-management-ideas-of-the-year-from-harvard-business-\nreview-with-bonus-article-how-ceos-manage-time-by-michael-e-porter-and-nitin-\nnohria/10296?referral=02560)\n\nLeadership & Managing People Book\n\n24.95 Add to Cart\n\n    * __Save\n    * __Share\n\nTo get started on this test-and-learn cycle, leadership teams typically employ\ntwo essential tools: a taxonomy of potential teams and a sequencing plan\nreflecting the company\u2019s key priorities. Let\u2019s first look at how each can be\nemployed and then explore what more is needed to tackle large-scale, long-term\nagile initiatives.\n\n### Create a taxonomy of teams.\n\nJust as agile teams compile a backlog of work to be accomplished in the\nfuture, companies that successfully scale up agile usually begin by creating a\nfull taxonomy of opportunities. Following agile\u2019s modular approach, they may\nbreak the taxonomy into three components\u2014customer experience teams, business\nprocess teams, and technology systems teams\u2014and then integrate them. The first\ncomponent identifies all the experiences that could significantly affect\nexternal and internal customer decisions, behaviors, and satisfaction. These\ncan usually be divided into a dozen or so major experiences (for example, one\nof a retail customer\u2019s major experiences is to buy and pay for a product),\nwhich in turn can be divided into dozens of more-specific experiences (the\ncustomer may need to choose a payment method, use a coupon, redeem loyalty\npoints, complete the checkout process, and get a receipt). The second\ncomponent examines the relationships among these experiences and key business\nprocesses (improved checkout to reduce time in lines, for instance), aiming to\nreduce overlapping responsibilities and increase collaboration between process\nteams and customer experience teams. The third focuses on developing\ntechnology systems (such as better mobile-checkout apps) to improve the\nprocesses that will support customer experience teams.\n\nThe taxonomy of a $10 billion business might identify anywhere from 350 to\n1,000 or more potential teams. Those numbers sound daunting, and senior\nexecutives are often loath even to consider so much change (\u201cHow about if we\ntry two or three of these things and see how it goes?\u201d). But the value of a\ntaxonomy is that it encourages exploration of a transformational vision while\nbreaking the journey into small steps that can be paused, turned, or halted at\nany time. It also helps leaders spot constraints. Once you\u2019ve identified the\nteams you could launch and the sorts of people you would need to staff them,\nfor instance, you need to ask: Do we have those people? If so, where are they?\nA taxonomy reveals your talent gaps and the kinds of people you must hire or\nretrain to fill them. Leaders can also see how each potential team fits into\nthe goal of delivering better customer experiences.\n\nUSAA has more than 500 agile teams up and running and plans to add 100 more in\n2018. The taxonomy is fully visible to everyone across the enterprise. \u201cIf you\ndon\u2019t have a really good taxonomy, you get redundancy and duplication,\u201d COO\nCarl Liebert told us. \u201cI want to walk into an auditorium and ask, \u2018Who owns\nthe member\u2019s change-of-address experience?\u2019 And I want a clear and confident\nresponse from a team that owns that experience, whether a member is calling\nus, logging into our website on a laptop, or using our mobile app. No finger-\npointing. No answers that begin with \u2018It\u2019s complicated.\u2019\u201d\n\nUSAA\u2019s taxonomy ties the activities of agile teams to the people responsible\nfor business units and product lines. The goal is to ensure that managers\nresponsible for specific parts of the P&L understand how cross-functional\nteams will influence their results. The company has senior leaders who act as\ngeneral managers in each line of business and are fully accountable for\nbusiness results. But those leaders rely on customer-focused, cross-\norganizational teams to get much of the work done. The company also depends on\ntechnology and digital resources assigned to the experience owners; the goal\nhere is to ensure that business leaders have the end-to-end resources to\ndeliver the outcomes they have committed to. The intent of the taxonomy is to\nclarify how to engage the right people in the right work without creating\nconfusion. This kind of link is especially important when hierarchical\norganizational structures do not align with customer behaviors. For example,\nmany companies have separate structures and P&Ls for online and offline\noperations\u2014but customers want seamlessly integrated omnichannel experiences. A\nclear taxonomy that launches the right cross-organizational teams makes such\nalignment possible.\n\n### Sequence the transition.\n\nTaxonomy in hand, the leadership team sets priorities and sequences\ninitiatives. Leaders must consider multiple criteria, including strategic\nimportance, budget limitations, availability of people, return on investment,\ncost of delays, risk levels, and interdependencies among teams. The most\nimportant\u2014and the most frequently overlooked\u2014are the pain points felt by\ncustomers and employees on the one hand and the organization\u2019s capabilities\nand constraints on the other. These determine the right balance between how\nfast the rollout should proceed and how many teams the organization can handle\nsimultaneously.\n\nA few companies, facing urgent strategic threats and in need of radical\nchange, have pursued big-bang, everything-at-once deployments in some units.\nFor example, in 2015 ING Netherlands anticipated rising customer demand for\ndigital solutions and increasing incursions by new digital competitors\n(\u201cfintechs\u201d). The management team decided to move aggressively. It dissolved\nthe organizational structures of its most innovative functions, including IT\ndevelopment, product management, channel management, and marketing\u2014essentially\nabolishing everyone\u2019s job. Then it created small agile \u201csquads\u201d and required\nnearly 3,500 employees to reapply for 2,500 redesigned positions on those\nsquads. About 40% of the people filling the positions had to learn new jobs,\nand all had to profoundly change their mindset. (See [ \u201cOne Bank\u2019s Agile Team\nExperiment,\u201d](/2018/03/one-banks-agile-team-experiment) HBR, March\u2013April\n2018.)\n\nBut big-bang transitions are hard. They require total leadership commitment, a\nreceptive culture, enough talented and experienced agile practitioners to\nstaff hundreds of teams without depleting other capabilities, and highly\nprescriptive instruction manuals to align everyone\u2019s approach. They also\nrequire a high tolerance of risk, along with contingency plans to deal with\nunexpected breakdowns. ING continues to iron out wrinkles as it expands agile\nthroughout the organization.\n\nCompanies short on those assets are better off rolling out agile in sequenced\nsteps, with each unit matching the implementation of opportunities to its\ncapabilities. At the beginning of its agile initiative, the advanced\ntechnology group at 3M Health Information Systems launched eight to 10 teams\nevery month or two; now, two years in, more than 90 teams are up and running.\n3M\u2019s Corporate Research Systems Lab got started later but launched 20 teams in\nthree months.\n\nBig-bang transitions are hard. It may be better to roll out agile in steps.\n\nWhatever the pace or endpoint, results should begin showing up quickly.\nFinancial results may take a while\u2014Jeff Bezos believes that most initiatives\ntake five to seven years to pay dividends for Amazon\u2014but positive changes in\ncustomer behavior and team problem solving provide early signs that\ninitiatives are on the right track. \u201cAgile adoption has already enabled\naccelerated product deliveries and the release of a beta application six\nmonths earlier than originally planned,\u201d says Tammy Sparrow, a senior program\nmanager at 3M Health Information Systems.\n\nDivision leaders can determine the sequencing just as any agile team would.\nStart with the initiatives that offer potentially the greatest value and the\nmost learning. SAP, the enterprise software company, was an early scaler of\nagile, launching the process a decade ago. Its leaders expanded agile first in\nits software development units\u2014a highly customer-centric segment where they\ncould test and refine the approach. They established a small consulting group\nto train, coach, and embed the new way of working, and they created a results\ntracker so that everyone could see the teams\u2019 gains. \u201cShowing concrete\nexamples of impressive productivity gains from agile created more and more\npull from the organization,\u201d says Sebastian Wagner, who was then a consulting\nmanager in that group. Over the next two years the company rolled out agile to\nmore than 80% of its development organizations, creating more than 2,000\nteams. People in sales and marketing saw the need to adapt in order to keep\nup, so those areas went next. Once the front end of the business was moving at\nspeed, it was time for the back end to make the leap, so SAP shifted its group\nworking on internal IT systems to agile.\n\nToo many companies make the mistake of going for easy wins. They put teams\ninto offsite incubators. They intervene to create easy workarounds to systemic\nobstacles. Such coddling increases the odds of a team\u2019s success, but it\ndoesn\u2019t produce the learning environment or organizational changes necessary\nto scale dozens or hundreds of teams. A company\u2019s early agile teams carry the\nburden of destiny. Testing them, just like testing any prototype, should\nreflect diverse, realistic conditions. Like SAP, the most successful companies\nfocus on vital customer experiences that cause the greatest frustrations among\nfunctional silos.\n\nStill, no agile team should launch unless and until it is ready to begin.\n_Ready_ doesn\u2019t mean planned in detail and guaranteed to succeed. It means\nthat the team is:\n\n  * focused on a major business opportunity with a lot at stake\n  * responsible for specific outcomes\n  * trusted to work autonomously\u2014guided by clear decision rights, properly resourced, and staffed with a small group of multidisciplinary experts who are passionate about the opportunity\n  * committed to applying agile values, principles, and practices\n  * empowered to collaborate closely with customers\n  * able to create rapid prototypes and fast feedback loops\n  * supported by senior executives who will address impediments and drive adoption of the team\u2019s work\n\nFollowing this checklist will help you plot your sequence for the greatest\nimpact on both customers and the organization.\n\n### Master large-scale agile initiatives.\n\nMany executives have trouble imagining that small agile teams can attack\nlarge-scale, long-term projects. But in principle there is no limit to the\nnumber of agile teams you can create or how large the initiative can be. You\ncan establish \u201cteams of teams\u201d that work on related initiatives\u2014an approach\nthat is highly scalable. Saab\u2019s aeronautics business, for instance, has more\nthan 100 agile teams operating across software, hardware, and fuselage for its\nGripen fighter jet\u2014a $43 million item that is certainly one of the most\ncomplex products in the world. It coordinates through daily team-of-teams\nstand-ups. At 7:30 AM each frontline agile team holds a 15-minute meeting to\nflag impediments, some of which cannot be resolved within that team. At 7:45\nthe impediments requiring coordination are escalated to a team of teams, where\nleaders work to either settle or further escalate issues. This approach\ncontinues, and by 8:45 the executive action team has a list of the critical\nissues it must resolve to keep progress on track. Aeronautics also coordinates\nits teams through a common rhythm of three-week sprints, a project master plan\nthat is treated as a living document, and the colocation of traditionally\ndisparate parts of the organization\u2014for instance, putting test pilots and\nsimulators with development teams. The results are dramatic: IHS Jane\u2019s has\ndeemed the Gripen the world\u2019s most cost-effective military aircraft.\n\nLeadership teams need to instill agile values throughout the entire\nenterprise.\n\n## Building Agility Across the Business\n\nExpanding the number of agile teams is an important step toward increasing the\nagility of a business. But equally important is how those teams interact with\nthe rest of the organization. Even the most advanced agile enterprises\u2014Amazon,\nSpotify, Google, Netflix, Bosch, Saab, SAP, Salesforce, Riot Games, Tesla, and\nSpaceX, to name a few\u2014operate with a mix of agile teams and traditional\nstructures. To ensure that bureaucratic functions don\u2019t hamper the work of\nagile teams or fail to adopt and commercialize the innovations developed by\nthose teams, such companies constantly push for greater change in at least\nfour areas.\n\n### Values and principles.\n\nA traditional hierarchical company can usually accommodate a small number of\nagile teams sprinkled around the organization. Conflicts between the teams and\nconventional procedures can be resolved through personal interventions and\nworkarounds. When a company launches several hundred agile teams, however,\nthat kind of ad hoc accommodation is no longer possible. Agile teams will be\npressing ahead on every front. Traditionally structured parts of the\norganization will fiercely defend the status quo. As with any change, skeptics\ncan and will produce all kinds of antibodies that attack agile, ranging from\nrefusals to operate on an agile timetable (\u201cSorry, we can\u2019t get to that\nsoftware module you need for six months\u201d) to the withholding of funds from big\nopportunities that require unfamiliar solutions.\n\nSo a leadership team hoping to scale up agile needs to instill agile values\nand principles throughout the enterprise, including the parts that do not\norganize into agile teams. This is why Bosch\u2019s leaders developed new\nleadership principles and fanned out throughout the company: They wanted to\nensure that everyone understood that things would be different and that agile\nwould be at the center of the company\u2019s culture.\n\n### Operating architectures.\n\nImplementing agile at scale requires modularizing and then seamlessly\nintegrating workstreams. For example, Amazon can deploy software thousands of\ntimes a day because its IT architecture was designed to help developers make\nfast, frequent releases without jeopardizing the firm\u2019s complex systems. But\nmany large companies, no matter how fast they can code programs, can deploy\nsoftware only a few times a day or a week; that\u2019s how their architecture\nworks.\n\nBuilding on the modular approach to product development pioneered by Toyota,\nTesla meticulously designs interfaces among the components of its cars to\nallow each module to innovate independently. Thus the bumper team can change\nanything as long as it maintains stable interfaces with the parts it affects.\nTesla is also abandoning traditional annual release cycles in favor of real-\ntime responses to customer feedback. CEO Elon Musk says that the company makes\nabout 20 engineering changes a week to improve the production and performance\nof the Model S. Examples include new battery packs, updated safety and\nautopilot hardware, and software that automatically adjusts the steering wheel\nand seat for easier entry and exit.\n\nIn the most advanced agile enterprises, innovative product and process\narchitectures are attacking some of the thorniest organizational constraints\nto further scaling. Riot Games, the developer of the wildly successful\nmultiplayer online battle arena League of Legends, is redesigning the\ninterfaces between agile teams and support-and-control functions that operate\nconventionally, such as facilities, finance, and HR. Brandon Hsiung, the\nproduct lead for this ongoing initiative, says it involves at least two key\nsteps. One is shifting the functions\u2019 definition of their customers. \u201cTheir\ncustomers are not their functional bosses, or the CEO, or even the board of\ndirectors,\u201d he explains. \u201cTheir customers are the development teams they\nserve, who ultimately serve our players.\u201d The company instituted Net Promoter\nsurveys to collect feedback on whether those customers would recommend the\nfunctions to others and made it plain that dissatisfied customers could\nsometimes hire outside providers. \u201cIt\u2019s the last thing we want to happen, but\nwe want to make sure our functions develop world-class capabilities that could\ncompete in a free market,\u201d Hsiung says.\n\nRiot Games also revamped how its corporate functions interact with its agile\nteams. Some members of corporate functions may be embedded in agile teams, or\na portion of a function\u2019s capacity may be dedicated to requests from agile\nteams. Alternatively, functions might have little formal engagement with the\nteams after collaborating with them to establish certain boundaries. Says\nHsiung: \u201cSilos such as real estate and learning and development might publish\nphilosophies, guidelines, and rules and then say, \u2018Here are our guidelines. As\nlong as you operate within them, you can go crazy; do whatever you believe is\nbest for our players.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn companies that have scaled up agile, the organization charts of support\nfunctions and routine operations generally look much as they did before,\nthough often with fewer management layers and broader spans of control as\nsupervisors learn to trust and empower people. The bigger changes are in the\nways functional departments work. Functional priorities are necessarily more\nfully aligned with corporate strategies. If one of the company\u2019s key\npriorities is improving customers\u2019 mobile experience, that can\u2019t be number 15\non finance\u2019s funding list or HR\u2019s hiring list. And departments such as legal\nmay need buffer capacity to deal with urgent requests from high-priority agile\nteams.\n\nOver time even routine operations with hierarchical structures are likely to\ndevelop more-agile mindsets. Of course, finance departments will always manage\nbudgets, but they don\u2019t need to keep questioning the decisions of the owners\nof agile initiatives. \u201cOur CFO constantly shifts accountability to empowered\nagile teams,\u201d says Ahmed Sidky, the head of development management at Riot\nGames. \u201cHe\u2019ll say, \u2018I am not here to run the finances of the company. You are,\nas team leaders. I\u2019m here in an advisory capacity.\u2019 In the day-to-day\norganization, finance partners are embedded in every team. They don\u2019t control\nwhat the teams do or don\u2019t do. They are more like finance coaches who ask hard\nquestions and provide deep expertise. But ultimately it\u2019s the team leader who\nmakes decisions, according to what is best for Riot players.\u201d\n\nSome companies, and some individuals, may find these trade-offs hard to accept\nand challenging to implement. Reducing control is always scary\u2014until you do so\nand find that people are happier and success rates triple. In a recent Bain\nsurvey of nearly 1,300 global executives, more respondents agreed with this\nstatement about management than with any other: \u201cToday\u2019s business leaders must\ntrust and empower people, not command and control them.\u201d (Only 5% disagreed.)\n\n### Talent acquisition and motivation.\n\nCompanies that are scaling up agile need systems for acquiring star players\nand motivating them to make teams better. (Treat your stars unfairly, and they\nwill bolt to a sexy start-up.) They also need to unleash the wasted potential\nof more-typical team members and build commitment, trust, and joint\naccountability for outcomes. There\u2019s no practical way to do this without\nchanging HR procedures. A company can no longer hire purely for expertise, for\ninstance; it now needs expertise combined with enthusiasm for work on a\ncollaborative team. It can\u2019t evaluate people according to whether they hit\nindividual objectives; it now needs to look at their performance on agile\nteams and at team members\u2019 evaluations of one another. Performance assessments\ntypically shift from an annual basis to a system that provides relevant\nfeedback and coaching every few weeks or months. Training and coaching\nprograms encourage the development of cross-functional skills customized to\nthe needs of individual employees. Job titles matter less and change less\nfrequently with self-governing teams and fewer hierarchical levels. Career\npaths show how product owners\u2014the individuals who set the vision and own the\nresults of an agile team\u2014can continue their personal development, expand their\ninfluence, and increase their compensation.\n\nCompanies may also need to revamp their compensation systems to reward group\nrather than individual accomplishments. They need recognition programs that\ncelebrate contributions immediately. Public recognition is better than\nconfidential cash bonuses at bolstering agile values\u2014it inspires recipients to\nimprove even further, and it motivates others to emulate the recipients\u2019\nbehaviors. Leaders can also reward \u201cA\u201d players by engaging them in the most\nvital opportunities, providing them with the most advanced tools and the\ngreatest possible freedom, and connecting them with the most talented mentors\nin their field.\n\n### Annual planning and budgeting cycles.\n\nIn bureaucratic companies, annual strategy sessions and budget negotiations\nare powerful tools for aligning the organization and securing commitments to\nstretch goals. Agile practitioners begin with different assumptions. They see\nthat customer needs change frequently and that breakthrough insights can occur\nat any time. In their view, annual cycles constrain innovation and adaptation:\nUnproductive projects burn resources until their budgets run out, while\ncritical innovations wait in line for the next budget cycle to compete for\nfunding.\n\nIn companies with many agile teams, funding procedures are different. Funders\nrecognize that for two-thirds of successful innovations, the original concept\nwill change significantly during the development process. They expect that\nteams will drop some features and launch others without waiting for the next\nannual cycle. As a result, funding procedures evolve to resemble those of a\nventure capitalist. VCs typically view funding decisions as opportunities to\npurchase options for further discovery. The objective is not to instantly\ncreate a large-scale business but, rather, to find a critical component of the\nultimate solution. This leads to a lot of apparent failures but accelerates\nand reduces the cost of learning. Such an approach works well in an agile\nenterprise, vastly improving the speed and efficiency of innovation.\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nCompanies that successfully scale up agile see major changes in their\nbusiness. Scaling up shifts the mix of work so that the business is doing more\ninnovation relative to routine operations. The business is better able to read\nchanging conditions and priorities, develop adaptive solutions, and avoid the\nconstant crises that so frequently hit traditional hierarchies. Disruptive\ninnovations will come to feel less disruptive and more like adaptive business\nas usual. The scaling up also brings agile values and principles to business\noperations and support functions, even if many routine activities remain. It\nleads to greater efficiency and productivity in some of the business\u2019s big\ncost centers. It improves operating architectures and organizational models to\nenhance coordination between agile teams and routine operations. Changes come\non line faster and are more responsive to customer needs. Finally, the\nbusiness delivers measurable improvements in outcomes\u2014not only better\nfinancial results but also greater customer loyalty and employee engagement.\n\nAgile\u2019s test-and-learn approach is often described as incremental and\niterative, but no one should mistake incremental development processes for\nincremental thinking. SpaceX, for example, aims to use agile innovation to\nbegin transporting people to Mars by 2024, with the goal of establishing a\nself-sustaining colony on the planet. How will that happen? Well, people at\nthe company don\u2019t really know\u2026yet. But they have a vision that it\u2019s possible,\nand they have some steps in mind. They intend to dramatically improve\nreliability and reduce expenses, partly by reusing rockets much like\nairplanes. They intend to improve propulsion systems to launch rockets that\ncan carry at least 100 people. They plan to figure out how to refuel in space.\nSome of the steps include pushing current technologies as far as possible and\nthen waiting for new partners and new technologies to emerge.\n\nThat\u2019s agile in practice: big ambitions and step-by-step progress. It shows\nthe way to proceed even when, as is so often the case, the future is murky.\n\nA version of this article appeared in the [May\u2013June 2018](/archive-toc/BR1803)\nissue (pp.88-96) of _Harvard Business Review_.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2008/11/thumbnail_110-darrell-rigby.jpg)\n\n[Darrell K.

mobility can\nsupport agile organisations.\n\n![Striving for agility](/media/images/striving-for-agility_13830_t12.jpg)\n\n![Fiona Murchie](/media/images/fmurchie_2410.jpg)\n\nFiona Murchie\n\n11

](mailto:enquiries@relocatemagazine.co.uk)\n\nAn Economist Intelligence Unit report in 2009 found that 88 per cent of\nexecutives cite agility as key to global success, yet many companies still\nadmit to not being flexible enough. Why?At a [CIPD National\nConference](https://events.cipd.co.uk/events/annual/) in Manchester last year,\nan illuminating talk by Dr Linda Holbeche extolled the benefits of designing\nmore agile organisations to a room of seasoned practitioners and strategists\nwho wanted to take their organisation to the next level.With HR directors\ntackling new data regulations, never-ending compliance issues and trying to\nmake sense of Brexit implications across their organisation, Ms Holbeche\nhelped shed some light on how mobility teams could work more fruitfully.\n\n[![Relocate_Festival_video_in_text](/media/images/Festival-2018-Video-V3_14117_t5.jpg)](/articles/mobility-\nindustry-exploring-leadership-agility-and-diversity-at-relocates-festival-\nmcurphey)\n\nHaving attended global conferences throughout the year where organisations are\nstriving to take on more and more, as well as respond to changes in their\nparticular industry sectors and continue to grow in new overseas markets, the\nimportance of agility made much sense.The ability to understand what makes an\nagile organisation will be a natural stepping stone for many HR and in-house\nglobal mobility specialists. I will enable them to chart the course for their\norganisation\u2019s mobility agenda, their assignees and business travellers, as\nwell as the myriad of service providers and specialists they are responsible\nfor in the complex area of managing international assignments, mobility and\ntalent.\n\n* * *\n\n **Other articles from the _Relocate_ website:**\n\n  *  **[Flexible Working Taskforce gets underway](/news/hr-flexible-working-taskforce-gets-underway-rholmes)**\n  *  **[hr-call-for-parental-leave-reforms-as-policies-failing-fathers-rholmes](/news/hr-call-for-parental-leave-reforms-as-policies-failing-fathers-rholmes)**\n  *  **[Re:locate Perspectives video: The importance of agility in business](/articles/reeditor-12-d3-2015-7952-relocate-perspectives-video-the-importance-of-agility-in-business)**\n\n* * *\n\n## So, what is agility and how does it work?\n\nThere are many reasons to explore why an organisation might go down the agile\nroute. Drawing insights from her book, [The Agile Organisation: How to build\nan innovative, sustainable and resilient\nbusiness](https://www.koganpage.com/product/the-agile-\norganization-9780749471316), Ms Holbeche concisely describes organisational\nagility as the \u201ccapacity for moving quickly, flexibly and decisively\u201d and\nboils it down to three core areas:\n\n  1. To gain competitive advantage by intelligently, rapidly and pro-actively seizing opportunities and reacting to threats\n  2. To adapt rapidly to changes in the business environment in efficient, productive and cost-effective ways\n  3. A dynamic capability that enables timely and effective organisation changes in response to internal and external environmental shifts and disruptions\n\nIn her presentation, Ms Holbeche went on to describe HR\u2019s critical role in\nenabling more agile routines in the workplace. These included continuous\nlearning, rapid decision making, creating adaptable structures and attracting\nand retaining multi-skilled and flexible people.She didn\u2019t disappoint as she\nled her audience through some deep thinking backed up by extensive research\nand powerful case studies.\n\n* * *\n\n _Don\u2019t miss Linda Holbeche\u2019s unique insights on how HR and global mobility\nteams can become more dynamic and innovative by designing more agile\nstructures. See her expand on this highly effective business strategy in\nperson during an exclusive keynote at the **[Festival of Global Mobility\nThinking](/events-festival-of-international-business-and-global-mobility)** on\n11 May 2018._\n\n* * *\n\nThere was much that was optimistic at the CIPD conference and CIPD chief\nexecutive, Peter Cheese, reaffirmed his belief in the opportunities ahead for\nHR. He said that shaping the workforce of the future; being the beacon for\ntrust, ethics and values and stepping up to the business and strategic partner\nroles that will come to shape companies in fast-changing times were all\nopportunities for HR.Ms Holbeche urged HR teams to build a culture of\ndisciplined innovation. This can be done by acting as an \u201cinnovation hub\u201d \u2013\ncollaborating with other disciplines to share knowledge, work on change\nprogrammes, design spaces and facilitate connections.In addition to this, she\nnoted the importance of developing reward and recognition schemes that\nactively encourage innovation, teamwork and knowledge sharing.As overseas\nmarkets develop and international experience becomes critical for many\norganisations at a time when skills shortages are increasing, global mobility\nspecialists have a crucial role to play in supporting and driving the agility\nand innovation agenda. International experience for women and younger\ngenerations are two areas where a substantial difference could be made.\n\n## Building a culture of resilience\n\n![Resiliently Agile ways of\nworking](/media/images/ResilientlyAgilewaysofworking_13870_t5.jpg)\n\nAs the _Resiliently Agile Ways of Working_ diagram shows, enabling effective\nlinkage is also essential. The book states, \u201cThe HR implications of agile\nimplementation are counter intuitive in some respects and there is no one size\nfits all to HR strategies. HR needs to embrace the strategic agility agenda \u2013\nanticipating emerging business needs and their talent and cultural\nimplications.\u201cWorkplace innovation and employer participation go hand in hand,\ntogether with the limitless possibilities for creative and rewarding\nentrepreneurship that these afford. By making better use of workforce talent,\nworkplace innovation has a profound effect on employees\u2019 learning and\ndevelopment, health and wellbeing.\u201dMs Holbeche adds, \u201cTo model the way\nforward, HR should embrace and champion agile methodology, utilising\nexperimentation and incremental change to build people management solutions\ngeared to supporting current and future business needs.\u201dGlobal mobility\ndepartments are very well positioned to deliver or support many of the\ncollaborative capabilities she suggests, which include:\n\n  * Flexible working options\n  * Effective diversity policies\n  * Developing career tracks\n  * Managing third-party relationships with care\n  * Interacting proactively with parent company \u2013 seek to influence\n  * Develop virtual and global managers\n  * Provide development for cross-boundary teams, including global teams\n  * Language and cultural training\n  * Manage conflict\n  * Apply agile work practices and project management disciplines to HR delivery\n  * Help to source and develop agile teams\n  * Recruit, develop and nurture agile managers/team leaders \n\n_\n\n[![the-agile-organisation](/media/images/The-Agile-\nOrganisation_13867_t5.jpg)](https://www.koganpage.com/product/the-agile-\norganization-9780749471316)\n\n__[In The Agile Organisation: How to build an\ninnovative](https://www.koganpage.com/product/the-agile-\norganization-9780749471316), sustainable and resilient business, Ms Holbeche\nexplores valuable insights for companies to work more creatively and\nprofitably.

Tea always\nhad a very important place in my life, especially growing up in Morocco where\ntea is a very important component of the social life.\n\nEverybody is always welcomed with a cup of tea with mint wherever you go,\nwhether you are family, friends or business partners. We could almost say that\ntea has always been in my blood!\n\nAfter being in the tea business for more than 20 years, and leading Singapore-\nbased TWG Tea for the past eight, I am proud to have founded one of the\nfastest growing luxury tea brands in the world.\n\n**What\u2019s your take on leadership?**\n\nI believe in a hands-off approach by allowing my team to take up the challenge\nof being responsible with their day-to-day activities \u2013 to have them shine and\nbe creative with their thought processes.\n\nI personally feel that if someone did something well, it would be an\nachievement and if someone failed doing a task, it would be an opportunity to\nlearn.\n\nA strong leader stands with his team, not on the sidelines giving out orders.\nThis is how you build a strong team.\n\n**What\u2019s been your most memorable moment at TWG Tea in the past eight years?**\n\nStarting out as Asia\u2019s first luxury tea brand. Setting up headquarters in\nSingapore was an important move, as it is not a tea-producing country. This\nmade it the perfect neutral base to do business with plantations across Asia.\n\nStrategically, we are also geographically closer to our sources, allowing us\nto receive the teas faster and in better condition compared to European or\nAmerican teahouses.\n\nFounded in 2008 as a luxury concept, launching TWG Tea has been an amazing\nexperience. We have expanded ourselves internationally and are now available\nin London, New York, Taiwan, China, Indonesia, Thailand and more.\n\nTWG Tea continues to strive to be the leading purveyor of exquisite teas in\nSingapore and around the world, and I am proud of our achievements thus far.\n\n> ##### I personally feel that if someone did something well, it would be an\n> achievement and if someone failed doing a task, it would be an opportunity\n> to learn.\n\n**What challenge did you face in setting things up here?**\n\nSince everyone in Asia is born with a proverbial cup of tea, we knew that it\nwould be challenging to create a new luxury tea brand here and, more\nimportantly, get Asians to embrace it as their own.\n\nThe only way we were going to achieve that was by offering the very finest\nquality teas available \u2013 rare harvests, exquisite varieties and exclusive\nblends. The rapid expansion of TWG Tea in the region is, for us, proof we have\nsucceeded in doing just that.\n\n**What gets you back in the groove after a tough day at work?**\n\nMy favourite way to de-stress is to spend time with my wife and son, watching\na movie, cooking, or going on a holiday.\n\nDelving into antique shops and wandering flea markets around the world allows\nme time for myself to collect my thoughts. However, I also take solace in my\ntea tasting room where I can experiment with different tea blends.\n\n**When it comes to your staff, how do you motivate them?**\n\nIt is necessary to recognise your staff\u2019s achievements, what they have done\nand are doing to add to the success of the company, and to reward them so they\nare motivated to keep up the good work.\n\nI also believe that spending time with family and having a work-life balance\nis key for positive morale and the success of the company. We encourage our\nstaff to take time off especially after they have worked long hours.\n\n> ##### Since everyone in Asia is born with a proverbial cup of tea, we knew\n> that it would be challenging to create a new luxury tea brand here and, more\n> importantly, get Asians to embrace it as their own.\n\n**Where does the HR function stand at TWG Tea?**\n\nI am very strict about the company\u2019s know-how and product quality, but in\nterms of human resources, I am quite flexible, allowing team members to thrive\nin what they do best.\n\nI believe the company will benefit from letting employees find their own place\nin what they do best rather than forcing them into a position that does not\nsuit them. The secret is that people work best at what they love.\n\n**With that in mind, how can the HR function add more value to the business?**\n\nOne of the most important aspects of our human resources strategy is the\ntraining and flexibility offered to our employees. Good training is the key to\na long and successful career and it is important that our staff fully\nunderstand and enjoy our products to be able to pass this excitement on to our\nclientele.\n\nWe also believe that people are best at what they love, and we encourage\ninternal moves for them to discover different aspects of the company.\n\n> ##### I believe the company will benefit from letting employees find their\n> own place in what they do best rather than forcing them into a position that\n> does not suit them.\n\n**Do you believe HR leaders can come up to the C-suite level?**\n\nThe talent crunch has indeed become more acute, and it is always good to train\npeople to operate outside of their comfort zones.\n\nAnyone with the right attitude and gumption can leverage their personal\nexperience and understanding of healthy business practices to drive positive\nchange within an organisation.\n\n**You\u2019ve been in this industry for two decades now. What do you love about\nit?**\n\nI love the tea business because I don\u2019t feel like I am working; it is my hobby\nand my passion. All those years in the tea industry and I don\u2019t see it as\nwork. Tea is a lifestyle.\n\n_Image: Provided_\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

\n\n![Adrian\nTan](//cmg.scdn4.secure.raxcdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/small/AdrianTan_0.png)\n\n# A serious look into the future of HR in Singapore\n\nBY ADRIAN TAN\n\nIn recent times, Airbnb redefined their HR function in terms of what it is and\nwhat it does with the appointment of a new Global Head of Employee Experience.\nThe role is to oversee and connect everything that has to do with their\n\"workplace as an experience\" vision, which is central to their culture and\ncustomer-centric approach.\n\nNumerous publications wrote about this with titles such as \"Bye bye, Human\nResources\" and \"Why did Airbnb get rid of its HR department?\"\n\nWith our workforce becoming more diversified and people staying shorter in any\none job, it is an apt time to address the future of HR in Singapore, and what\nbetter event to do this than the NTUC's U HR Leaders Forum 2016?\n\nI'll skip the talks and panel discussions to jump right into the part where\nthe future of HR in Singapore is shared (although I must point out I\nthoroughly enjoyed the talk given by Alvin Yapp of BusAds).\n\nThe Secretary-General of NTUC, Mr Chan Chun Sing, held a closed-door dialogue\nwith senior HR practitioners to discuss about the future of HR as a\nprofession. Here's the highlight of his comments which could give us an\ninsight into the future of HR in Singapore:\n\n_1\\. How can we make HR a respected profession?_  \nThe dialogue went into the deep end really quickly after a participant\nremarked that HR is sometimes seen as a profession for people who can't go\nanywhere else. With that premise, how do you make HR a respected profession?\n\nSG Chan was quick to point out that nobody could look down on HR professionals\nif they don't look down on themselves first.\n\nHR professionals often inundate themselves with the supply side of things\n(i.e. hiring workers) but completely forget the demand side (i.e. knowing\nwhich department is growing the fastest and what kind of workers they need).\n\nIf HR doesn't bother to learn more about the business, it's not surprising\nworkers just go to HR for their paycheck and admin issues.\n\n_2\\. How can you upskill to be an HR master?_  \nCompetency 101 tells us that the typical expectation of an HR professional is\nto make sure workers get their salary on time. But a real HR manager grows the\npotential of the organisation's human capital instead of just managing the\nhuman resources.\n\nThe role of an HR manager is akin to the union leaders' in which he is\nexpected to:  \n\\- take care of the workers  \n\\- make sure they're treated fairly and respectfully  \n\\- treat workers not just as a digit, but actual human capital\n\nTo competently help the people, SG Chan explained how HR skills can be viewed\nas 3 levels of proficiency:  \no Level 1: help today's unemployed into today's job vacancy  \no Level 2: help today's unemployed into tomorrow's jobs  \no Level 3: help tomorrow's unemployed into tomorrow's jobs\n\nThis is especially so for people who are working in jobs which will be\ndisrupted by technology. Training and redeployment has to be done ahead of\ntime before they lose their jobs. And that also includes helping the workers\nto understand why they need to learn new skills and get them out of their\ncomfort zone before it is too late.\n\n_3\\. I 'm not a CHRO, can I still influence change?_  \nThe killer punch came about when SG Chan asked the audience if they would ask\ntheir kids to join the HR profession. Not all raised their hands because we\nknow the HR profession isn't as perfect as we hope. And to expect things to\nchange by itself is futile.\n\nWe should influence change in our environment in our current roles, instead of\nsaying we have no influence because we aren't CHROs. With the latter mindset,\nwe would have already lost the willpower to make changes because we already\nbecome too complacent with the current system.\n\n_4\\. How do we value HR professionals?_  \nSG Chan highlighted that development plans are being put in place for HR\nprofessionals to have:  \n\\- a central code of conduct  \n\\- a nationally recognised framework to ensure HR professionals have a skills-\nand-career ladder for their own profession\n\nSG Chan emphasised he will do all he can to take care of HR so that they can\ntake care of the workers under their watch.\n\nNTUC will meet with HR professionals more regularly to ensure we are most\ncapable and equipped to walk the new path. Internally, we as HR professionals\nmust be able to better communicate our value across to the employer that we\nare worth their salt.\n\nOne question to ask yourself is if you have 20 years of experience, is it 20\nyears of varied experience in your career, or just doing the same one job for\n20 years?\n\n**_The views expressed in this column are the author 's own and do not\nnecessarily reflect this publication's view, and this article is not edited by\nSingapore Business Review.

So\ncalled, because of the \u201cC\u201d representing the word \u201cchief\u201d in many corporate\ntitles. Also known as \u201cC-level executives\u201d, these are the roles responsible\nfor leading a business and its respective departments and, as such, are the\nmost powerful figures in the company.\n\n  * What is a CEO?\n  * What is a CMO?\n  * What is a CFO?\n  * What is a CIO?\n  * What is a CDO?\n\n####  **What is a CEO?**\n\nThe chief executive officer (CEO) is the most senior C-suite executive in a\ncompany and, ultimately, responsible for managing the organisation as a whole.\nCharged with maximising the company\u2019s value, CEOs report todirectly the board,\nand may even be the chairman themselves. The face of the company, every other\nrole reports to the CEO, requiring them to be strong leaders with a vision for\nthe framework and direction of the organisation.\n\n![C-Suite members climbing ladders](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/11/future-ceo-becoming-ceo-2-1280x720.jpg)\n\nAs with business, the nature of the CEO\u2019s role is changing all the time, and\nthere are indications that a stronger marketing focus may be required from the\nCEOs of the future. Executive search firm [Heidrick &\nStruggles](https://www.heidrick.com/~/media/Publications%20and%20Reports/Route_to_the_Top_2017.pdf)\nfound the proportion of European chief executives with a marketing background\ngrew from 15 per cent to 21 per cent between 2011 and 2015. Dave Lewis,\nTesco\u2019s chief executive, was Unilever\u2019s marketer responsible for Dove\u2019s Real\nBeauty campaign, while Sainsbury\u2019s chief executive Mike Coupe is a former\nTesco marketing director.\n\nIt is also no longer the case that CEOs must grow for years with the brands\nthey come to manage. \u201cCEOs are a broad bunch, but there\u2019s an appreciation they\nno longer need to \u2018serve their time\u2019 like they used to,\u201d says Brenda\nTrenowden, former managing director of Lloyds Banking Group. \u201cNowadays, being\nat one company all your life could work against you. They need broader\nexperience. They have to be [better communicators, more attuned to different\ngroups](https://www.raconteur.net/risk-management/cultural-change-map-ceos),\ngrasp technology better and be more agile.\u201d\n\n _Read more about the CEO:_\n\n  * [ _How to become a CEO_](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/how-to-become-a-ceo)\n  * [ _Cultural change: a map for CEOs_](https://www.raconteur.net/risk-management/cultural-change-map-ceos)\n  * [ _CEOs struggle to balance shareholder returns and growth_](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/ceos-struggle-balance-shareholder-returns-growth)\n  * [ _A new era of brand building for CEOs_](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/new-era-of-brand-building-ceos)\n  *  **[ _The Future CEO 2018 special report_](https://www.raconteur.net/future-ceo-2018)**\n\n####  **What is a CMO?**\n\nThe chief marketing officer (CMO) is the executive responsible for all of an\norganisation\u2019s marketing activity. This can include market research, brand and\nproduct management, communications, pricing and customer service. CMOs must\ncreate and lead a marketing strategy which can generate business and brand\ngrowth.\n\n\u201cThe current landscape is forcing CMOs to become complete businesspeople.\u201d[\nsays Bob Liodice](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/cmos-experts-marketing-growth),\nchief executive of the Association of National Advertisers. \u201cNot just expert\nmarketers, they now need to be solid and expert growth champions. It\u2019s about\nmastering measurement and accountability; it\u2019s about mastering the digital\nmedia supply chain; and it\u2019s about mastering talent and diversity, from gender\nequality to multiculturalism.\u201d\n\n[Today\u2019s CMO must be as comfortable with data\nscience](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/positive-new-challenges-for-the-cmos-of-\ntoday), technology, econometrics and analytics as they are with agencies and\ncreatives. They\u2019re as likely to be accountable for go-to-market campaigns as\nthey are churn management and loyalty, digital transformation, and developing\ninnovation pipelines.\n\nJeff Dodds, TalkTalk\u2019s managing director for mobile and former CMO of Virgin\nMedia comments: \u201cIt\u2019s not that marketing has changed; if you go back to the\noriginal definition of marketing being about the seven Ps [product, price,\nplace, promotion, people, process and physical evidence], that\u2019s fundamentally\nwhat a CMO is grappling with today, it\u2019s just taken a while for organisations\nto catch up and place all of those responsibilities under one leadership\nrole.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the path to this C-suite marketing role is also changing, with\nfuture CMOs likely to have a background beyond the traditional creative and\ncommunications routes.\n\n _Read more about the CMO:_\n\n  * [ _CMOs must be experts in marketing and growth alike_](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/cmos-experts-marketing-growth)\n  * [ _Positive new challenges for the CMOs of today_](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/positive-new-challenges-for-the-cmos-of-today)\n  * [ _CMOs now have to juggle many roles  _](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/cmos-now-have-to-juggle-many-roles)\n  * [ ** _The Future CMO 2018 special report_**](https://www.raconteur.net/future-cmo-2018)\n\n####  **What is a CFO?**\n\nThe chief financial officer (CFO) is the executive responsible for managing a\ncompany\u2019s finances. This includes financial planning, record-keeping,\nfinancial risk management, data analysis and financial reporting. Ultimately,\nthe CFO is the top of the career ladder for any accountant, and is one of the\nroles which most commonly leads to becoming CEO.\n\n![Member of C-Suite looking at wall full of post-\nits](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/CFO_p6_1-1.jpg)\n\n\u201cStephen Robertson, chief executive of the Big Issue Foundation says hard\nfinancial success got him noticed by a headhunter. \u201cIt was all about what I\u2019d\ndemonstrated,\u201d he reflects. \u201cCommerciality mattered. Yes, a CEO is about\nrelationship building, but it\u2019s hard to demonstrate this at interview, so\nfinancial background has sway. Hirers want to remove the speculative element\nthat taking on a CEO can be.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps not surprising that a head for figures is still a trait most\nchief executives share. According to 2016 research by recruitment firm Robert\nHalf, more than 50 per cent of FTSE 100 heads have a finance, accounting or\nfinancial services background and 25 per cent are ex-accountants.\n\nBut not every CFO has CEO aspirations. An[ Ernst and Young survey from 2016\n](https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-do-you-define-your-cfo-\nrole/$FILE/EY-do-you-define-your-cfo-role-or-does-it-define-you.pdf)found that\nmore than 70 per cent of finance leaders did not aspire to be CEO. The aim was\nto be a more objective, independent voice at the boardroom table, one which\nbrought facts and reasoning to bear on the more intuitive skills of the\nC-suite.\n\nIn order to do this, however, the future CFO will need a different set of\nskills to those traditionally honed by the finance function. And top of the\nlist, according to an EY report, is [an understanding of digital, smart\ntechnologies ](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/the-future-cfo-less-finance-and-\nmore-strategy)and sophisticated data analytics. Instead of being an\nessentially historic and backward-looking function, finance has to become much\nmore active. With technology taking over the grunt work, the entire finance\nfunction is upskilling and the CFO has to lead the change.\n\n _Read more about the CFO:_\n\n  * [ _The future CFO: less finance and more strategy?_](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/the-future-cfo-less-finance-and-more-strategy)\n  * [ _Dangers of \u2018beefing up\u2019 the CFO role_](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/dangers-of-beefing-up-the-role-of-the-cfo)\n  * [ _Goodbye CFO?

This includes everything from\ncreating policy and strategy to talent management, procurement and systems\nmaintenance within the department.\n\nThe future CIO, however, will have a lot more on their plate than IT issues.\nAccording to [a 2018 report from\nGartner](https://www.gartner.com/imagesrv/cio-trends/pdf/cio_agenda_2018.pdf),\n84 per cent of CIOs at top-performing organisations have responsibility for\nareas of the business outside traditional IT, the most common being innovation\nand transformation. \u201cThe CIO\u2019s role is transforming from delivery executive to\nbusiness executive,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe role of the CIO has evolved in parallel with the growing development and\ninfluence of technology. As tech has become essential for businesses, CIOs\nhave become a mainstay of the organisation. They have switched from being a\nback-end IT executor to a strategic and influential member of the board tasked\nwith delivering growth.\n\nThere is no point in a CIO sitting with the rest of the C-suite, however, if\ntheir voice isn\u2019t heard, ensuring technology can make a meaningful impact on\nthe business.\n\n\u201cYou need to lead the conversation with the business first and have a broader\nset of skills including the need to understand financials; you can\u2019t just sit\nin the meeting and wait until technology comes up and shut up the rest of the\ntime,\u201d [says Richard Steward](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/role-cio-today),\nformer CIO of advertising business Clear Channel and UK consumer goods firm PZ\nCussons.\n\nTo do that, the Bank of England\u2019s executive director and CIO Rob Elsey\nsuggests CIOs must understand the business drivers, the threats to the\norganisation and the opportunities. Crucially, he says, the CIO needs to be\nable to \u201cdemystify technologies to the board\u201d.\n\n _Read more about the CIO:_\n\n  * [ _What is the role of a CIO today?_](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/role-cio-today)\n  * [ _CIOs need to lead the cultural change_](https://www.raconteur.net/digital-transformation/cios-need-to-lead-the-cultural-change)\n  * [ _The freelance CIO boosts the startup economy_](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/the-freelance-cio-boosts-the-startup-economy)\n  * [ _CIOs at the heart of digital shift_](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/cios-at-the-heart-of-digital-shift)\n  *  **[ _The Future CIO 2018 special report_](https://www.raconteur.net/future-cio-2018)**\n\n####  **What is a CDO?**\n\nThe chief data officer (CDO) is responsible for a company\u2019s data governance,\nsomething which is becoming increasingly important in today\u2019s data age.\nOrganisations are moving to becoming more data-driven, and the CDO must ensure\nthat data is relevant, protected and easy to access.\n\n![C-Suite CDO glasses in front of data on\nscreen](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/glasses-in-front-\nof-laptop-screen-covered-in-text.jpg)\n\n[Nic Orton is CDO ](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/successful-cdo)for global\ndata analytics organisation LexisNexis Risk Solutions; \u201cthe success of my role\nis considered in the ultimate performance of the business, but more directly I\nensure we use the right data in the right way,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a consensus\nthat the data universe is doubling every two years, with a 50-fold growth\nbetween 2010 and 2020. I promote innovation, but also ensure focus and trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have four main metrics: uplift to products through added value; insight\nand intelligence for ourselves on customers, competitors and markets;\npotential for advanced analytics; and quality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe success criteria for a chief data officer need to flow from an\norganisation\u2019s digital strategy\u201d says Brenden Dalton, CDO and chief\ninformation officer for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research\nOrganisation in Canberra. \u201cIf that pushes disruption, for example, then the\nCDO needs to work with a higher tolerance to data risk.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo a successful CDO needs to unite an organisation in its appreciation of\ndata risk and decide on the right level of oversight for business units, and\nhow much freedom to give them.\u201d\n\n _Read more about the CDO:_\n\n  * [ _What makes a successful Chief Data Officer?_](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/successful-cdo)\n  * [

that the remit of the C-suite is constantly\nshifting and evolving, no one member can remain solely within their field and\nall must be able to work together to tackle the issues facing business today.\n\n####  **What do you need to make the C-suite?**\n\n  * Confident communication skills, especially when collaborating with the board and fellow C-levels\n  * A good understanding of data and emerging technologies and how they apply to your organisation\n  * Strong leadership ability\n  * An agile mindset and a willingness to upskill where necessary to adapt to a shifting business

They want to make it world-class. To dispense with all\nthe nonsense and negativity that annoys employees and stops good intentions\nfrom growing into progress. To bring about an entirely different approach,\nstarting immediately.\n\nThese culture critiques are as common as complaints about the weather -- and\nabout as effective. How frequently have you seen high-minded aspirations to\n\"change the culture\" actually manage to modify the way that people behave and\nthe way in which they work? And how often have you seen noticeable long-term\nimprovements?\n\n## What Is Corporate Culture?\n\nAt its worst, culture can be a drag on productivity. At its best, it is an\nemotional energizer. Here's how companies can use it to gain a competitive\nadvantage.\n\nIf the answer to these last two questions is \"rarely,\" it wouldn't surprise\nus. We don't believe that swift, wholesale culture change is possible -- or\neven desirable. After all, a company's culture is its basic personality, the\nessence of how its people interact and work. However, it is an elusively\ncomplex entity that survives and evolves mostly through gradual shifts in\nleadership, strategy, and other circumstances. We find the most useful\ndefinition is also the simplest: Culture is the self-sustaining pattern of\nbehavior that determines how things are done.\n\nMade of instinctive, repetitive habits and emotional responses, culture can't\nbe copied or easily pinned down. Corporate cultures are constantly self-\nrenewing and slowly evolving: What people feel, think, and believe is\nreflected and shaped by the way they go about their business. Formal efforts\nto change a culture (to replace it with something entirely new and different)\nseldom manage to get to the heart of what motivates people, what makes them\ntick. Strongly worded memos from on high are deleted within hours. You can\nplaster the walls with large banners proclaiming new values, but people will\ngo about their days, right beneath those signs, continuing with the habits\nthat are familiar and comfortable.\n\nBut this inherent complexity shouldn't deter leaders from trying to use\nculture as a lever. If you cannot simply replace the entire machine, work on\nrealigning some of the more useful cogs. The name of the game is making use of\nwhat you cannot change by using some of the emotional forces within your\ncurrent culture differently.\n\n[![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/media/image/35275027_ex1b.gif)\n\n**Source:** [The Katzenbach\nCenter](mailto:global.katzenbach.center@us.pwc.com)  \n**For further insights:** See [strategy-\nbusiness.com/10PrinciplesCulture](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/feature/10-Principles-of-Organizational-Culture)  \n**Infographic:** Opto Design/Peter Stemmler\n\nThree dimensions of corporate culture affect its alignment: symbolic reminders\n(artifacts that are entirely visible), keystone behaviors (recurring acts that\ntrigger other behaviors and that are both visible and invisible), and mind-\nsets (attitudes and beliefs that are widely shared but exclusively invisible).\nOf these, behaviors are the most powerful determinant of real change. What\npeople actually do matters more than what they say or believe. And so to\nobtain more positive influences from your cultural situation, you should start\nworking on changing the most critical behaviors -- the mind-sets will follow.\nOver time, altered behavior patterns and habits can produce better results.\n\nYou may be asking: If it is so hard to change culture, why should we even\nbother to try? Because an organization's current culture contains several\nreservoirs of emotional energy and influence. Executives who work with them\ncan greatly accelerate strategic and operating imperatives. When positive\nculture forces and strategic priorities are in sync, companies can draw energy\nfrom the way people feel. This accelerates a company's movement to gain\ncompetitive advantage, or regain advantages that have been lost.\n\nResearch shows that companies that use a few specific cultural catalysts --\nthat is to say, those that use informal emotional approaches to influencing\nbehavior -- are significantly more likely to experience change that lasts. Of\nthe companies that reported consciously using elements of their culture in\nStrategy&'s 2013 [Global Culture & Change Management\nSurvey](http://www.strategyand.pwc.com/culture-and-change), 70 percent said\ntheir firms achieved sustainable improvement in organizational pride and\nemotional commitment. That compares with 35 percent for firms that didn't use\nculture as a lever. Although there is no magic formula, no brilliant\nalgorithm, no numerical equation that will guarantee results, we have gleaned\nsome valuable insights through decades of research and observation at dozens\nof enterprises, including some of the most successful companies in the world.\nBy adopting the following principles, your organization can learn to deploy\nand improve its culture in a manner that will increase the odds of financial\nand operational success.\n\n**1.  Work with and within your current cultural situations.** Deeply embedded\ncultures cannot be replaced with simple upgrades, or even with major overhaul\nefforts. Nor can your culture be swapped out for a new one as though it were\nan operating system or a CPU. To a degree, your current cultural situation\njust is what it is -- and it contains components that provide natural\nadvantages to companies as well as components that may act as brakes. We've\nnever seen a culture that is all bad, or one that is all good. To work with\nyour culture effectively, therefore, you must understand it, recognize which\ntraits are preeminent and consistent, and discern under what types of\nconditions these traits are likely to be a help or a hindrance. Put another\nway, there's both a yin and a yang to cultural traits.\n\nFor example, a European pharmaceutical company with a solid product\ndevelopment pipeline had a tendency to be inward-looking. It had great\nexecution capabilities and an excellent record of compliance with regulators\naround the world. However, when new products were ready to be launched, the\ncompany had a hard time marketing them to physicians and healthcare providers.\nRather than bemoaning the company's ingrained insularity -- for example, its\ncollective tendency to value the opinions of internal colleagues more than\nthose of outside experts -- the leaders decided to use this feature of its\nculture to its advantage. They set up a program through which employees were\nacknowledged and rewarded by colleagues for \"going the extra mile\" to support\ncustomers. By recognizing a new kind of internal authoritativeness, the\ncompany tapped a powerful emotional trigger already in place, and engendered a\nnew (and strategically important) behavior in its sales force.\n\n**2.  Change behaviors, and mind-sets will follow.** It is a commonly held\nview that behavioral change follows mental shifts, as surely as night follows\nday. This is why organizations often try to change mind-sets (and ultimately\nbehavior) by communicating values and putting them in glossy brochures. This\ntechnique didn't work well for Enron, where accounting fraud and scandal were\npart of everyday practice, even as the company's espoused values of\nexcellence, respect, integrity, and communication were carved into the marble\nfloor of the atrium of its global headquarters in Houston. In reality, culture\nis much more a matter of doing than of saying. Trying to change a culture\npurely through top-down messaging, training and development programs, and\nidentifiable cues seldom changes people's beliefs or behaviors. In fact,\nneuroscience research suggests that people act their way into believing rather\nthan thinking their way into acting. Changes to key behaviors -- changes that\nare tangible, actionable, repeatable, observable, and measurable -- are thus a\ngood place to start. Some good examples of behavior change, which we've\nobserved at a number of companies, relate to empowerment (reducing the number\nof approvals needed for decisions), collaboration (setting up easy ways to\nconvene joint projects), and interpersonal relations (devising mutually\nrespectful practices for raising contentious issues or grievances).\n\nNeuroscience research suggests that people act their way into believing rather\nthan thinking their way into acting.\n\nA telecommunications company was seeking to improve its customer service.\nRather than trying to influence mind-sets by, for example, posting signs\nurging employees to be polite to disgruntled customers, or having employees\nundergo empathy training, the company focused on what psychologists call a\n\"precursor behavior\" -- a seemingly innocuous behavior that reliably precedes\nthe occurrence of problem behavior. Leaders had noticed that poor teaming led\nto poor customer service, so the company rolled out a plan to encourage better\nand more effective teaming within call centers. To accomplish this, they set\nup regular design sessions for improving practices. When employees felt they\nwere part of a happy team, and sensed a greater level of support from\ncolleagues, they began treating their customers better.\n\nIn another example, a resources company in the Middle East was seeking to make\nits workplace safer. Rather than erect placards threatening workers with\nconsequences, the company focused on a relatively basic precursor behavior:\nhousekeeping. It organized a litter drive. Picking up trash as a team helped\nemployees take greater pride in the workplace, which engendered a greater\nsense of care for fellow employees and made them more likely to speak up when\nthey noticed an unsafe situation. Changed behavior, changed mind-set.\n\n**3.  Focus on a critical few behaviors.** Conventional wisdom advocates a\ncomprehensive approach -- everybody should change everything that's not\nperfect! But companies must be rigorously selective when it comes to picking\nbehaviors. The key is to focus on what we call \"the critical few,\" a small\nnumber of important behaviors that would have great impact if put into\npractice by a significant number of people. Discern a few things people do\nthroughout the company that positively affect business performance -- for\nexample, ways of starting meetings or talking with customers. Make sure those\nare aligned with the company's overall strategy. Also check that people feel\ngood about doing these things, so that you tap into emotional commitment. Then\ncodify them: Translate those critical behaviors into simple, practical steps\nthat people can take every day. Next, select groups of employees who are\nprimed for these few behaviors, those who will respond strongly to the new\nbehaviors and who are likely to implement and spread them.\n\nAt an Asian banking company, rapid inorganic growth had led to diverse ways of\nworking across different units and geographies. To focus on improving teaming,\ncustomer outcomes, and the ability to realize synergies, the CEO and\nleadership embarked on a culture-led evolution program. They targeted just\nthree critical behaviors: taking extra steps to delight customers, valuing\nperformance over seniority, and backing up and supporting one another. They\nthen converted these three general behaviors into specifics for each part of\nthe company. Delighting customers, for instance, was translated into frontline\nstaff collaborating with other colleagues to solve client problems and\nprioritizing the implementation of process improvements that affected customer\noutcomes. For all three behaviors, leadership recognized and celebrated\nexamples in which people made an extraordinary effort. Senior leaders acted as\nrole models, explicitly modeling these three new behaviors. The company also\nidentified influential frontline, client-facing employees who could\ndemonstrate these new behaviors in action.\n\n**4.  Deploy your authentic informal leaders.** Authority, which is conferred\nby a formal position, should not be confused with leadership. Leadership is a\nnatural attribute, exercised and displayed informally without regard to title\nor position in the organizational chart. Because authentic informal leaders,\nwho are found in every organization, are often not recognized as such, they\nare frequently overlooked and underused when it comes to driving culture. It\nis possible to identify such leaders through interviews, surveys, and tools\nsuch as organizational network analysis, which allow companies to construct\nmaps of complex internal social relations by analyzing email statistics and\nmeeting records. Once identified, these leaders can become powerful allies who\ncan influence behavior through \"showing by doing.\" In fact, when companies map\nout their organizations, they can identify leaders who exhibit different core\nleadership strengths (see \"Four Types of Authentic Informal Leaders\").\n\n## Four Types of Authentic Informal Leaders\n\nEvery organization has people who influence and energize others without\nrelying on their title or formal position in the hierarchy to do so. We call\nthem \"authentic informal leaders.\" They are a powerful resource in spreading a\ncritical few behaviors from the bottom up. Among the many types of informal\nleaders present in organizations, the following are seen most frequently.\n\n**Pride builders** are master motivators of other people, and catalysts for\nimprovement around them. Often found in the role of line manager, they\nunderstand the motivations of those with whom they work. They know how to\nfoster a sense of excellence among others. They can be found at every level of\na hierarchy; some of the most effective pride builders are close to the front\nline, where they can interact directly with customers as well as employees.\nPride builders often have powerful insights about the culture and about what\nbehaviors are likely to lead to improvement.\n\n**Exemplars** are role models. They bring vital behaviors or skills to life,\nand others pay attention to them. They are well respected and are effective\npeer influencers in the middle and senior management cohorts.\n\n**Networkers** are hubs of personal communication within the organization.\nThey know many people, and communicate freely and openly with them. They serve\nas links among people who might not otherwise share information or ideas. If\nyou want to see an idea travel virally through an enterprise, enlist your\nnetworkers.\n\n**Early adopters** enthusiastically latch onto and experiment with new\ntechnologies, processes, and ways of working. Involve them in your performance\npilots, or whenever you are trying to demonstrate impact quickly.\n\nAt one major oil company, an informal leader named Osama became known as the\n\"turbo-collaborator.\" His role gave him very little formal influence. But when\nhe began working at the refinery, he walked the plant with the engineers,\nmaintenance technicians, and operators, and took copious notes. As a result,\nhe knew everyone and developed relationships across disciplines. Whenever\nsomebody wanted to know how the place really worked, they would speak to Osama\n-- who would either have the answer in his notebook or know precisely the\nright person to ask. When the company formed a buddy program between\noperations and maintenance aimed at using greater collaboration to improve\nplant reliability, it knew it needed Osama at the heart of it. He connected\npeople, defined templates to encourage collaboration, and captured success\nstories. Identifying, engaging, and nurturing such informal leaders allows\ncompanies to harness their talents and further the company's transformation\nefforts.\n\n**5.  Don't let your formal leaders off the hook.** Most organizations tend to\nshunt culture into the silo of human resources professionals. But leaders in\nall parts of the company are critical in safeguarding and championing desired\nbehaviors, energizing personal feelings, and reinforcing cultural alignment.\nThe signaling of emotional commitment sets the tone for others to follow. If\nstaff members see a disconnect between the culture an organization promulgates\nand the one its formal leadership follows, they'll disengage quickly from the\nadvertised culture and simply mimic their seniors' behavior. The people at the\ntop have to demonstrate the change they want to see. Here, too, the critical\nfew come into play. A handful of the right kind of leaders have to be on board\nto start the process.\n\nWhen Jim Rogers was CEO of GE Motors in Fort Wayne, Ind., he became frustrated\nbecause his senior leadership group of more than 15 leaders seldom functioned\ntogether as a \"real team.\" As described by Jon Katzenbach and Douglas K. Smith\nin _The Wisdom of Teams: Creating the High-Performance Organization_ (Harvard\nBusiness School Press, 1993), a real team is one with a high level of\nemotional commitment; the leadership role shifts easily among the members\ndepending on their skills and experience and the challenges of the moment,\nrather than on any hierarchical positions. Team members hold one another\naccountable for the quality of their collective work. Interestingly, at GE\nMotors the senior leadership group members often demonstrated real team\ncapabilities in running their individual business units and functions. So\nRogers decided to find ways to break them into subteams of three or four\nmembers to address specific cross-organizational issues facing the larger\ngroup. Over time, he mixed the subgroupings to match emerging issues. By\nworking in different subgroup settings, the executives developed camaraderie,\nwhich in turn improved the effectiveness of the group as a whole.\n\n**6.  Link behaviors to business objectives.** When people talk about\nfeelings, motivations, and values -- all of which are vital elements of strong\ncultures -- the conversation can often veer into abstractions. It may then\nrange far afield of what it takes to succeed in the market. Too many employees\nwalk away from culture-focused town halls or values discussions wondering how\nthe advice on how to be a better person actually translates into the work they\ndo. To avoid this disconnect, offer tangible, well-defined examples of how\ncultural interventions lead to improved performance and financial outcomes.\nSelect behaviors that are aimed specifically at improving business performance\nand can be measured over time.\n\n## Related Stories\n\n  * [![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-business.com/blog/Make-a-Crisis-Last)\n\n### [Make a Crisis Last](https://www.strategy-business.com/blog/Make-a-Crisis-\nLast)\n\nby Jon Katzenbach\n\n  * [![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00179)\n\n### [Culture and the chief executive](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/article/00179)\n\nby Jon Katzenbach and DeAnne Aguirre\n\n  * [![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00324)\n\n### [Mark Bertolini's Preventive Disruption ](https://www.strategy-\nbusiness.com/article/00324)\n\nby Jon R. Katzenbach, Gretchen Anderson, and Art Kleiner\n\nAn oil company's drive to reduce maintenance costs at an industrial\ninstallation highlights the importance of such an approach. The critical few\nbehaviors included empowerment and good decision making. One of the company's\nexemplars (employees who lead by example) decided it would be a smart move to\nmake costs visible to workers. So he placed price tags on various pieces of\nmachinery. These cues inspired behavioral changes related to decisions about\nwhether to repair or replace equipment. Workers and managers began to\nrecommend fixing expensive equipment rather than replacing it. The company\ncelebrated and publicized cost savings identified by employees. The behaviors\nled to a change in focus and mind-set. When an employee noticed that fans were\ncooling the machinery during the winter, he felt empowered to call it out, and\nask whether it was necessary to do so. It turned out that it wasn't -- and the\ncompany saved US$750,000 annually in power costs as a result.\n\n**7.  Demonstrate impact quickly.** We live in an age of notoriously short\nattention spans. That applies as much to organizational culture as it does to\npeople's media consumption habits. When people hear about new high-profile\ninitiatives and efforts, and then don't see any activity related to them for\nseveral months, they'll disengage and grow cynical. That's why it is extremely\nimportant to showcase the impact of cultural efforts on business results as\nquickly as possible. One effective method of doing so is to stage performance\npilots -- that is, high-profile demonstration projects. Pilots are relatively\nlow-risk efforts that introduce specific behaviors that can then be evaluated\nand assessed. They often rely on a dashboard that defines desired impacts, the\ntactics used, and the specific metrics to be employed.\n\nWhen Bell Canada first explored using new behaviors at the front line to\nimprove its customer service and profitability, there were many more skeptics\nthan believers within the leadership ranks. There simply wasn't any numerical\nproof that the tactics would work. So CEO Michael Sabia decided to set up a\npilot test in a sales unit near Toronto. The sponsors of the test blocked out\na tight time frame of eight months, and developed realistic ways of measuring\nbehavior change, customer reactions, and actual sales and margin performance.\nArmed with positive results in these areas -- a 29 percent increase in\ncustomer satisfaction in retail stores, a 31 percent increase in revenue per\ncall at call centers -- the company went on to accelerate the expansion of\nthese efforts across the front line in different geographies, functions, and\nbusinesses.\n\n**8.  Use cross-organizational methods to go viral.** Ideas can spread virally\nacross organizational departments and functions, as well as from the top down\nand from the bottom up. One powerful way to spread ideas is through social\nmedia: blogs, Facebook or LinkedIn posts, and tweets -- not from senior\nmanagement, but from some of the authentic informal leaders mentioned in\nPrinciple 4.\n\nBy now it is well established that social media can be more effective at\nspreading information, news, and music than traditional modes of distribution.\nThe same holds with critical behaviors. People are often more receptive to\nchanges in \"the way we do things around here\" when those changes are\nrecommended or shared by friends, colleagues, and other associates. This kind\nof credible social proof is more compelling than similar testimonials from\nsomeone whose job it is to sell something.\n\nJust as there is an art to making content go viral, there's a craft to making\nbehavior go viral. For example, in a model that we have tested successfully in\nseveral situations, a company starts with a few carefully chosen groups of 12\nto 15 informal leaders in three or four different parts of the business. After\nseveral weeks, an additional 10 to 15 groups of informal leaders are set up in\nevery business unit. After about three months, the existing groups are\nencouraged to expand and bring in new people. After another three to six\nmonths have passed, the groups become more autonomous, allowed to control\ntheir own expansion. Meanwhile, the company facilitates connections among\ngroups to share learning and insights. As behavior spreads, company leaders\nsee increased performance as well as peer and leadership recognition.\n\n**9.  Align programmatic efforts with behaviors.** We've emphasized the role\nthat informal leaders can play in helping ideas go viral. But it's also\nimportant to match the new cultural direction with existing ways of doing\nbusiness. Informal mechanisms and cultural interventions must complement and\nintegrate with the more common formal organization components, not work at\ncross-purposes. By providing the structure in which people work -- through\ndisciplines such as organization design, analytics, human resources, and lean\nprocess improvement -- the formal organization provides a rational motivation\nfor employee actions, while the informal organization enables the emotional\ncommitment that characterizes peak performance.\n\nThe U.S. Marine Corps provides a classic example of integrating formal and\ninformal leadership efforts. The \"rule of three\" dictates how the Marines\ndesign their organizations and projects and how they execute in a hierarchy.\n(Three squads form into one of three divisions, which form one of three\nbattalions.) The formal leaders of those units are expected to know the intent\nof the officer two levels above them -- and to call out any order or situation\nthey perceive to be incoherent or in conflict with that intent. But there are\nalso informal leaders: Each of the four members of a frontline rifle team is\nprepared (and expected) to take the lead whenever the formal leader is\ndisabled or loses the high-ground position. This means that the informal\nleaders also need to know the intent of that officer two levels above.\nIntegrating informal norms with the formal structures helps enable the timely\nbattlefield adjustments that have served the Marine Corps well for more than\n200 years.\n\n**10.  Actively manage your cultural situation over time.** Companies that\nhave had great success working with culture -- we call them \"culture\nsuperstars\" -- actively monitor, manage, care for, and update their cultural\nforces. Why? As we noted at the outset, when aligned with strategic and\noperating priorities, culture can provide hidden sources of energy and\nmotivation that can accelerate changes faster than formal processes and\nprograms. Even if you have a highly effective culture today, it may not be\ngood enough for tomorrow.\n\nSouthwest Airlines stands as an example of a battle-tested company in which\nculture has been managed over time. Famous for its long-term success in an\nindustry where even the largest players routinely fail, Southwest for 40 years\nhas been energized by a deep sense of pride among all employees. Southwest has\nfound that constructing an environment that puts its employees first -- above\ncustomers and owners -- fosters a sense of emotional commitment and pride that\ndelivers excellent customer service. But at Southwest, the work on culture is\nnever completed. Just as the airline's strategy, tactics, and technologies\nhave evolved to cope with a changing external environment, specific HR\npractices, including informal behaviors, have shifted over time.\n\n### Living in Your Culture\n\nAlthough challenging, multidimensional, and often difficult to deal with, a\ncompany's cultural situation constitutes a powerful set of emotional\nresources. As is the case with other resources -- human, technological,\nfinancial -- it is incumbent upon leaders to strive to get the most value out\nof it.\n\nTo a degree, culture can be compared to natural forces such as winds and\ntides. These elements are there in the background, sometimes unnoticed,\nsometimes obvious. Endowed with immense power, they can waylay plans and\ninhibit progress. They can't really be tamed or fundamentally altered. But if\nyou respect them and understand how to make the most of them, if you work with\nthem and tap into their hidden power, they can become a source of energy and\nprovide powerful assistance.\n\nThe best way to start is to ask yourself a series of questions. What are the\nmost important emotional forces that determine what your people do? What few\nbehavior changes would matter most in meeting strategic and operational\nimperatives? Who are the authentic informal leaders you can enlist? And what\ncan you and your fellow senior leaders do differently to signal and reinforce\nthose critical behaviors?\n\nOf course, you shouldn't plan for dramatic results overnight. Expect an\nevolution, not a revolution. One of the challenges of working with culture is\nthat, as we've noted, it changes gradually -- often too slowly for leaders\nfacing fast-moving competitors. That's the bad news. The good news? If you\napproach culture with respect and intelligence, as a milieu in which you and\nyour enterprise live, you can use it to accelerate your competitive momentum.\nThere's no better time than the present to start.\n\nReprint No. 16105\n\n## Author Profiles:\n\n  * **[Jon Katzenbach](mailto:jon.katzenbach@pwc.com)**  is an acclaimed advisor to executives for Strategy&, PwC's strategy consulting group.

Corporate clients increasingly demand it in\nyour supply chain. Regulators, who use a \u201cstable\u201d or \u201cinclusive\u201d culture as a\nproxy for low risk, are breathing down your neck. Governments like Britain\u2019s,\nwhich now mandates pay-gap reporting, insist on making more of your sensitive\ndata public. And employees, including former ones, can air their complaints on\nsocial media.\n\nSmall wonder that 87% of your fellow bosses told consultants at PwC that\ndiversity is a business priority. I\u2019m sure you did, too. After all, you\nrecently posted a job opening for a diversity manager. You were not alone; the\nnumber of such offers in Britain has doubled in the past year, say analysts at\nGlassdoor, a recruitment website. Since June 2017 more than 800 American CEOs\nhave signed a pledge to \u201cadvance diversity and inclusion in the workplace\u201d.\n\nThat is where we are: lots of talk, plenty of initiatives, little change on\nthe ground. Between 2015 and 2018 the share of female executives at large\n(mostly) American and British firms went from 12% to 14%; for ethnic\nminorities it moved from 12% to 13%. The FTSE 100 has fewer female CEOs (six)\nthan it does bosses who share your name (seven). In American companies with\nover 100 employees, the share of black men in management was 3.4% in 2017,\nhalf their share in the population as a whole\u2014and virtually unchanged from 3%\nin 1985. White women make up 25% of executives and senior managers, compared\nwith 60% for white men. Something is clearly amiss.\n\nIn the past this letter would have gone straight to your legal department.\nSince the term \u201cdiversity\u201d entered the corporate lexicon in the 1960s it has\nbeen code for avoiding lawsuits\u2014especially in America, where companies have\ncoughed up billions in fines for discrimination over the years. The financial\nsector still treats it mostly as a compliance issue.\n\nNow you are no doubt tempted to forward it to someone in HR, almost certainly\na woman with an arts degree, a sound moral compass and too little power.\nDon\u2019t. This is your problem. Without your leadership it is unlikely to be\nsolved soon.\n\n## Keep reading\n\nDeep inside, you may be wondering if anything really needs solving. The short\nanswer is: it does. With that in mind, you should ask yourself three things.\n\nFirst, why does diversity matter to your firm? Is your reputation in trouble,\nas it was for Uber, Nike, Lloyd\u2019s of London and others scarred by #MeToo? Do\nyou, like consumer giants such as P&G, hope that more diversity makes for\nbetter products? Are you concerned about attracting and retaining bright\nsparks? You would be in good company: 97% of executives fret about increased\ncompetition for talent (according to Mercer\u2019s HR consultants).\n\nOr are you hoping that diversity will boost the bottom line? To be perfectly\nhonest, I have no idea if it does. It is hard to tell if diversity helps firms\ndo well, or if successful firms are also more enlightened on other matters.\nBut variety has been linked to innovation, productivity and, for example in\ndiverse teams of surgeons, fewer mistakes. Lack of it breeds groupthink\u2014which\nin turn can lead to disasters. The Bay of Pigs invasion and the Lehman\nBrothers collapse stemmed from narrow-mindedness. And employees who believe\ntheir firm cares about gender diversity are 40% more likely to be satisfied at\nwork\u2014and possibly more productive as a result.\n\nOnce you have sorted out the why, consider where you want to get to. Some\nfirms, like Facebook, Nike or P&G, say they wish to mirror their customer\nbase. Others are keen not to recruit from an artificially thin talent pool.\nGoldman Sachs claims its new entry-level recruitment targets\u201450% female and,\nin America, 14% Hispanic and 11% black\u2014are based on things like graduation\nrates. Clear goals make it easier to assess if you are on track. But make them\nattainable. Qantas\u2019s goal of 40% of its pilot intake to be female by 2028 is\nas admirable as it looks unrealistic: today just one in 20 pilots worldwide is\na woman.\n\nThe third question concerns barriers that stop diverse talent from flourishing\nat your firm. Mapping how it flows through your organisation and where the\nblockages and leaks happen is a start. A McKinsey study of more than 300\ncompanies identified the second step of the career ladder, from entry level to\nmanager, as the \u201cbroken rung\u201d: for every 100 men only 72 women (and just 68\nHispanic and 58 black ones) earned that critical early promotion. When Google\nwas losing women in disproportionate numbers it homed in on maternity as the\nprincipal cause; the technology giant increased maternity leave and support\nfor mothers returning to work.\n\nStaff surveys can help, provided they are large and comprehensive enough.\nAfter its #MeToo moment, Lloyd\u2019s, an insurance market, found that 45% of staff\nfelt unable to raise concerns about improper conduct. Employees are now\nencouraged to speak up, including through a bullying-and-harassment helpline.\nA \u201cculture dashboard\u201d tracking progress on survey metrics will be published\nwith the Lloyd\u2019s annual report.\n\nNow you\u2019ve got your diversity-and-inclusion priorities straight and diagnosed\nwhat needs fixing. Good. Before you order a rainbow float for a Pride parade\nand send staff on a micro-aggression avoidance course, here is what not to do.\n\nAmerican firms spend billions a year on training. Half of large ones have\nunconscious-bias seminars. Most of these \u201cD&I\u201d programmes are a waste. Or\nworse: recent research from America shows that diversity statements can put\noff minorities, possibly because they perceive them as tokenism. Often, firms\ndo D but forget I, which is about ensuring that the workforce is not just\ndiverse, but thriving. Too many try to fix people instead of procedures.\nTraining women to be more assertive in asking for a promotion or pay rise is\npointless; they are just as likely to ask for these but also likelier to be\nseen as pushy when they do. Ushering your managers onto the \u201cCheck Your Blind\nSpots bus\u201d, currently touring America as part of the CEOs\u2019 drive, is unlikely\nto do much. \u201cDays of understanding\u201d, popular in American offices, risk causing\n\u201cdiversity fatigue\u201d. It is hard to beat bias out of individuals\u2014easier to root\nit out of systems.\n\n## The don\u2019ts\n\nTake Silicon Valley. Big Tech has splurged on D&I to little effect.\nRepresentation of blacks and Hispanics has been flat (see chart). Girls Who\nCode, an industry-sponsored NGO, found that a quarter of young women who\napplied for internships at tech firms said they were asked inappropriate or\nbiased questions. Others reported being flirted with or demeaned. It\u2019s no use\nhiring diverse coders if the message then is: wear a hoodie and pretend to be\na guy, or this is no place for you. They will underperform\u2014or flee, leaving\nyou as undiverse as before. Firms that do not change their ways beyond\nrecruitment see high attrition rates of diverse talent. A lack of diversity is\na symptom of deeper problems that a few diversity hires won\u2019t mend.\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-\nedition/20191109_WBC111.png)\n\nAt this point the how should be relatively clear. In a nutshell, it is all\nabout creating a level playing field. When recruiting, software can mute\nbiases by concealing giveaways to a candidate\u2019s gender or ethnic identity.\nThese include names but also less obvious hints like the sports they play. If\nonly the usual suspects apply, look harder. Specialised recruitment drives,\nsuch as visiting \u201cblack\u201d colleges or advertising in women\u2019s forums, appear to\nwork. The Bank of England no longer visits the Russell group of top\nuniversities, whose graduates apply in spades anyway, and focuses instead on\nless elite schools. BHP, an Anglo-Australian mining giant, broadened its\nsearch for female miners by recruiting from professions, such as nursing, with\nsome similar skills.\n\nIn an effort to find trainees from different backgrounds, British law firms\nare trying \u201ccontextual recruitment\u201d. An applicant with Bs from a school where\neveryone got Cs may be more impressive than one with As from a place full of\nA* pupils. Rare, a recruitment firm, has developed software which screens\ncandidates for disadvantage and gauges their outperformance against the\naverage for their school.\n\nOnce in the workplace, the clearer your criteria for professional advancement,\nthe better. Informality is the enemy of women and minorities. It perpetuates\nbias. Surveys of American engineers and lawyers found that female workers were\nnearly twice as likely as their male peers to be saddled with \u201coffice\nhousework\u201d, like setting up meetings and conference calls. White men were\nlikelier to be given careerenhancing tasks such as client meetings.\n\nSponsorship schemes are an effective way to ensure traditionally sidelined\ngroups get a fair shot. PayScale, a pay-comparison site, found that employees\nwith a sponsor made 11.6% more than those without. The Bank of England has\noffered most of its sponsorship places to ethnic-minority women. Staff\nsurveys, if bite-sized but regular, can bring clarity to fuzzy inclusion\nmetrics. \u201cPsychological safety\u201d, lingo for an environment where people feel\nfree to speak their mind, can be tracked with questions like \u201care your ideas\nregularly attributed to someone else?\u201d or \u201care you regularly interrupted in\nmeetings?\u201d Rotating who chairs a meeting, or a firm word with loudmouths who\ndominate it, can help.\n\nMany employers\u2014yourself included\u2014would be horrified to learn that they\nimplicitly require employees who want to be considered leadership material to\nadjust their behaviour. Women shouldn\u2019t need to \u201cact like a man\u201d, gay\nemployees to \u201cact straight\u201d or people with frizzy hair to treat it to \u201clook\nprofessional\u201d (ie, white). Let grievances fester and your workers will lose\nmotivation or simply leave.\n\nThat is a lot to take in. But unless you do, your most valuable\nresource\u2014workers\u2014will not be as good as it could be. Best to get ahead of the\nproblem. It isn\u2019t that hard. And it can pay off mightily.\n\nYours,  \nShareholder\u25a0\n\nThis article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the\nheadline \"Diversity memo\"\n\n[Reuse this\ncontent](https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&publication=economist&title=How%20to%20make%20your%20firm%20more%20diverse%20and%20inclusive&publicationDate=2019-11-07&contentID=%2Fcontent%2F7o55ugt3nenp3ld38cilkck137677us6&type=A&orderBeanReset=TRUE)[The\nTrust Project](https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist)\n\n## More from Business\n\n### [Bartleby  \nJobs for jailbirds](/business/2020/04/04/jobs-for-jailbirds)\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-\nedition/20200404_WBD001_0.jpg)\n\n[Business](/business/)\n\n### [Great white night  \nGovernments are once again splurging to keep big companies\nafloat](/business/2020/04/03/governments-are-once-again-splurging-to-keep-big-\ncompanies-afloat)\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-\nedition/20200404_WBP003_0.jpg)\n\n[Business](/business/)\n\n### [Up in the air  \nBoeing ponders its bail-out options](/business/2020/04/03/boeing-ponders-its-\nbail-out-options)\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20200404_WBP504.jpg)\n\n[Business](/business/)\n\n## The best of our journalism, handpicked each day\n\nSign up to our free daily newsletter, The Economist today\n\n[Sign up now](https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter)\n\n![A hand holding a newspaper](/static/illustration/newsletter-signup.svg)\n\n  * [Subscribe](https://subscription.economist.com/DE/EngCore/EcomNewArticle/Footer)\n  * [Group subscriptions](https://groupsubscriptions.economist.com)\n  * [Help](https://www.economist.com/help/home)\n\n## Keep updated\n\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist)\n  * [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist)\n  * [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/theeconomist)\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-economist)\n  * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/economistmagazine)\n  * [RSS](https://www.economist.com/rss)\n\nPublished since September 1843 to take part in _\u201ca severe contest between\nintelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance\nobstructing our progress.\u201d_\n\n## Apps & media\n\n  * [The Economist apps](https://www.economist.com/apps)\n  * [Economist Films](https://films.economist.com)\n  * [Podcasts](https://www.economist.com/blogs/podcasts)\n\n## Other publications\n\n  * [1843 Magazine](https://www.1843magazine.com)\n  * [The World in](https://theworldin.economist.com/)\n  * [The World If](https://www.economist.com/worldif18)\n\n## The Economist\n\n  * [About](https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist)\n  * [Advertise](http://marketingsolutions.economist.com)\n  * [Press centre](https://press.economist.com)\n\n## The Economist Group\n\n  * [Economist Group](https://www.economistgroup.com/)\n  * [The Economist Store](https://shop.economist.com)\n  * [Careers](https://economistgroupcareers.com)\n  * [Which MBA?](https://www.economist.com/whichmba)\n  * [GMAT Tutor](https://gmat.economist.com/)\n  * [GRE Tutor](https://gre.economist.com/)\n  * [Executive Jobs](http://jobs.economist.com/)\n  * [Executive Education Navigator](https://execed.economist.com)\n\n  * [Terms of Use](https://www.economist.com/legal/terms-of-use)\n  * [Privacy](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/privacy)\n  * [Cookie Policy](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/Cookies_information.html)\n  * [Manage Cookies](https://l3.evidon.com/site/2254/668/6?lang=en-gb)\n  * [Accessibility](https://www.economist.com/help/accessibilitypolicy)\n  * [Modern Slavery Statement](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/guiding_principles.html)\n  * [Do Not Sell My Personal Information](http://privacyportal.economist.com/)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Economist Newspaper Limited 2020.

Unauthorised\ndisclosures - data revealed to the wrong people - have also doubled.\n\nThe Chief Security Officer (CSO) will be tasked with ensuring that security\nand privacy is \u201cby design and implementation\u201d and that \u201cappropriate controls\nare in existence throughout the CDIO organisation and wider HMRC business\u201d.\n\nAccording to an organisation chart from earlier this year, HMRC doesn\u2019t\ncurrently have a CSO in place.\n\nThe advertised salary is currently at \u00a3149,500 per annum, but the job notice\nstates that more may be available for an \u201cexceptional candidate\u201d, subject to\nMinisterial approval.\n\nJacky Wright, HMRC\u2019s CDIO, said:\n\n> This is an exciting time for digital and technology in HMRC. We are in the\n> middle of a major transformation process that will fundamentally improve the\n> department\u2019s networks, technology, and digital services for our customers\n> and colleagues. I have only been part of our journey for a short period of\n> time, but am constantly amazed by the scope of HMRC\u2019s operation and the\n> opportunities we have to become a world leader in government technology.\n>\n> To achieve our goals we\u2019re innovative in our approach using the latest\n> technology available. It\u2019s not just our customers we focus on - we want our\n> colleagues\u2019 experience of working with us to be an outstanding one, and have\n> career pathways that are rewarding and fulfilling for everyone in the\n> department. We\u2019re creating a genuinely diverse and inclusive workplace where\n> everyone feels able to bring their best.\n\nWe noted recently how HMRC has advertised for a number of technology roles in\nrecent months, including senior positions for AI, Enterprise Cloud Services,\nand Mobility and Workplace.\n\nHMRC has one of the largest tech transformation portfolios across government.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe successful candidate will need to demonstrate experience of anticipating\nmajor change and preparing organisations to meet that change, whilst \u201cmanaging\nconfidently through uncertainty and bringing stakeholders along the journey\u201d.\n\nHMRC is also seeking someone with strategic influencing skills, as well as\nstrong decision making, negotiating and conflict resolution skills.\n\nIn terms of key responsibilities, some of these are set to include:\n\n  * Deliver a set of technical security services to internal customers and programmes across HMRC in a way that is agile and risk-informed. \n  * Establish and maintain HMRC\u2019s security program to ensure that information assets and associated technology, applications, systems, infrastructure and processes are adequately protected in the ecosystem in which HMRC operates.\n  * Strengthen HMRC\u2019s personnel security position by designing and implementing an appropriate personnel security framework.\n  * Liaise with other functions outside CDIO, including finance, HR, legal and ethics teams and 3rd parties, to ensure security and data protection risks are understood, considered and satisfactorily mitigated as an intrinsic part of HMRC\u2019s organisational activities. \n  * Drive the implementation and monitoring of compliance to relevant regulatory and government requirements. Oversee the identification, evaluation and reporting of legal and regulatory, IT, and cyber security risk to information assets, while supporting and advancing business objectives. \n  * Provide leadership oversight to ensure threats that HMRC and our customers face are addressed effectively and expeditiously; Ensure appropriate response to security incidents and drive continuous improvements by learning from them. \n  * Ensure the design, development, operation, evolution and promotion of a business continuity model that is fit for purpose.\n  * Represent HMRC on relevant cross-government Boards, and engage with the Government Security Group to influence the cyber, physical and personnel security agenda across government.\n\nInterested candidates have until 8th September to apply and it is expected\nthat final interviews will take place the week commencing 7th October.\n\n_Image credit -

Business leaders\n[believe](http://www.fuqua.duke.edu/news_events/news-releases/corporate-\nculture/#.VkoNq4S3IVU) a strong organizational culture is critical to success,\nyet culture tends to feel like some magic force that few know how to control.\nSo most executives manage it according to their intuition.\n\nWe\u2019ve found that answering three questions can help transform culture from a\nmystery to a science: 1) How does culture drive performance? 2) What is\nculture worth? 3) What processes in an organization affect culture? In this\narticle, we address each of these to show how leaders can engineer high-\nperforming organizational cultures \u2014 and measure their impact on the bottom\nline.\n\n### How does culture drive performance?\n\nAfter surveying over 20,000 workers around the world, analyzing 50 major\ncompanies, conducting scores of experiments, and scouring the landscape of\nacademic research in a range of disciplines, we came to one conclusion: _Why\nwe work determines how well we work._\n\n#### Insight Center\n\n  * ###### [How to Be a Company That Employees Love](/insight-center/how-to-be-a-company-that-employees-love)\n\nSponsored by Citrix GoToMeeting\n\nIt takes a careful mix of mission, management, and culture.\n\nOne [2013\nstudy](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016726811300036X)\nillustrates this well. Researchers asked almost 2,500 workers to analyze\nmedical images for \u201cobjects of interest.\u201d They told one group that the work\nwould be discarded; they told the other group that the objects were \u201ccancerous\ntumor cells.\u201d The workers were paid per image analyzed. The latter group, or\n\u201cmeaning\u201d group, spent more time on each image, earning 10% less, on average,\nthan the \u201cdiscard\u201d group \u2014 but the quality of their work was higher. Reshaping\nthe workers\u2019 motive resulted in better performance.\n\nAcademics have studied why people work for nearly a century, but a major\nbreakthrough happened in the 1980s when professors Edward Deci and Richard\nRyan from the University of Rochester distinguished the [six main\nreasons](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780306420221) why people work. We\nbuilt on their framework and adapted it for the modern workplace. The six main\nreasons people work are: play, purpose, potential, emotional pressure,\neconomic pressure, and inertia.\n\nRelated Video\n\n######  [What Really Influences Employee Motivation](/video/4701966304001)\n\nIt's not compensation.\n\n  * [__Save](/video/4701966304001)\n  * [__Share](/video/4701966304001)\n\n[ See More Videos >](/video)\n\n[ See More Videos >](/video)\n\nThe work of many researchers has found that the first three motives tend to\nincrease performance, while the latter three hurt it. We found that the\ncompanies most famous for their cultures \u2014 from Southwest Airlines to Trader\nJoe\u2019s \u2014 maximize the [good motives](http://www.fastcompany.com/3050251/what-\namazon-can-teach-us-about-high-performing-work-cultures), while minimizing the\nbad ones.\n\n  * **Play** is when you are motivated by the work itself. You work because you enjoy it. A teacher at play enjoys the core activities of teaching \u2014 creating lesson plans, grading tests, or problem solving how to break through to each student. Play is our learning instinct, and it\u2019s tied to curiosity, experimentation, and exploring challenging problems.\n\n  * **Purpose** is when the direct outcome of the work fits your identity. You work because you value the work\u2019s impact. For example, a teacher driven by purpose values or identifies with the goal of educating and empowering children.\n\n  * **Potential** is when the outcome of the work benefits your identity. In other words, the work enhances your potential. For example, a teacher with potential may be doing his job because he eventually wants to become a principal.\n\nSince these three motives are directly connected to the work itself in some\nway, you can think of them as direct motives. They will improve performance to\ndifferent degrees. Indirect motives, however, tend to reduce it.\n\n  * **Emotional pressure** is when you work because some external force threatens your identity. If you\u2019ve ever used guilt to compel a loved one to do something, you\u2019ve inflicted emotional pressure. Fear, peer pressure, and shame are all forms of emotional pressure. When you do something to avoid disappointing yourself or others, you\u2019re acting on emotional pressure. This motive is completely separate from the work itself.\n\n  * **Economic** pressure is when an external force makes you work. You work to gain a reward or avoid a punishment. Now the motive is not only separate from the work itself, it is also separate from your identity.\n\n  * Finally, **inertia** is when the motive is so far removed from the work and your identity that you can\u2019t identify why you\u2019re working. When you ask someone why they are doing their work, and they say, \u201cI don\u2019t know; I\u2019m doing it because I did it yesterday and the day before,\u201d that signals **inertia**. It is still a motive because you\u2019re still actually doing the activity, you just can\u2019t explain why.\n\nThese indirect motives tend to reduce performance because you\u2019re no longer\nthinking about the work\u2014you\u2019re thinking about the disappointment, or the\nreward, or why you\u2019re bothering to do it at all. You\u2019re distracted, and you\nmight not even care about the work itself or the quality of the outcome.\n\nWe found that a high-performing culture maximizes the play, purpose, and\npotential felt by its people, and minimizes the emotional pressure, economic\npressure, and inertia. This is known as creating total motivation (ToMo).\n\nTake, for example, an\n[experiment](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/48/2/393/) conducted by\nTeresa Amabile at Harvard. She assembled a group of poets to write a simple\nshort poem on the topic of laughter. Before they wrote anything, she had one\ngroup read a list of \u201cplay\u201d reasons for being a poet (\u201cyou enjoy the\nopportunity for self-expression\u201d or \u201cyou like to play with words\u201d), and she\nhad the other group read a list of emotional and economic pressure reasons\n(\u201cyou want your writing teachers to be favorably impressed with your writing\ntalent\u201d or \u201cyou have heard of cases where one bestselling novel or collection\nof poems has made the author financially secure\u201d). She found that the play\ngroup created poems that were later deemed about 26% more creative than the\npoems of the pressure group. The play group\u2019s higher total motivation made a\ndifference when it came to performance.\n\n#### How to Measure Total Motivation\n\nWe survey employees of an organization, asking six questions\u2013one for each\nmotive. Each question determines how much of each motive a person feels in\ntheir work, on a scale between 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree).\nThen we use the following formula to calculate the individual\u2019s total\nmotivation, which is then used in calculating that of the organization:  \n  \n(10 x the score for play) + (5 x purpose) + (1 2/3 x potential) \u2013 (1 2/3 x\nemotional pressure) \u2013 (5 x economic pressure) \u2013 (10 x inertia)  \n  \nWe determined the weighting of each motive by conducting regressions between\neach motive and performance across industries, and then simplified to build a\nsimple metric that ranges from -100 to 100. The weights demonstrate that the\ncloser the motive is to the work itself, the more it drives performance.  \n  \nYou can measure your ToMo or your team\u2019s ToMo using a\n[survey](http://www.vegafactor.com/book) on our site.\n\n### What is culture worth?\n\nCreating a business case for culture isn\u2019t impossible. While it is difficult\nto measure whether someone is being creative, proactive, or resilient in the\nmoment, it\u2019s actually not difficult to calculate total motivation. Using six\nquestions, one for each motive, we can compute an organization\u2019s ToMo using\nvery simple math (see the sidebar for the calculation) and then determine its\nimpact on performance.\n\nTake for example the airline industry. Players share the same terminals and\nuse the same planes, but customer satisfaction differs widely across carriers.\nWhen we measured the total motivation of employees of four major airlines, and\ncompared their cultures with an outcome like [customer\nsatisfaction](http://www.theacsi.org/) (as measured by the ACSI / University\nof Michigan), we saw that an organization\u2019s culture (as measured by ToMo)\ntightly predicted customer satisfaction.\n\n![W151106_MCGREGOR_HIGHERCUSTOMER](/resources/images/article_assets/2015/11/W151106_MCGREGOR_HIGHERCUSTOMER.png)\n\nIn other words, cultures that inspired more play, purpose, and potential, and\nless emotional pressure, economic pressure, and inertia, produced better\ncustomer outcomes. We saw this play out in retail, banking,\ntelecommunications, and the fast food industry as well. And the impact isn\u2019t\nlimited to customer satisfaction. In one hedge fund, the highest performing\nportfolio managers had higher total motivation. And in one retail organization\nwe worked with, we found that the difference between a low-ToMo and high-ToMo\nsales associate was 30% in revenues.\n\n### What processes in an organization affect culture?\n\nWe have asked thousands of managers how they would define a high-performing\nculture. Most don\u2019t have a great definition. So here is one: Culture is the\nset of processes in an organization that affects the total motivation of its\npeople. In a high-performing culture, those processes maximize total\nmotivation. When we measured how different processes affect employees\u2019 total\nmotivation, we learned a couple things:\n\n**There  is no silver bullet. **Many processes affect people\u2019s ToMo at work.\nBy surveying thousands of US workers, we measured how much the elements of a\nworkplace \u2014 from how a job is designed to how performance is reviewed \u2014 affect\nToMo.\n\n![W151106_MCGREGOR_EMPLOYEEMOTIVATION](/resources/images/article_assets/2015/11/W151106_MCGREGOR_EMPLOYEEMOTIVATION.png)\n\nWhat the chart shows is that while we tend to think that leadership matters\nmost to motivation, other processes can have an even bigger impact. The x-axis\nshows the ToMo scale (which goes from -100 to 100). The grey bars represent\nthe range to which each process affects an employee\u2019s total motivation, as\ngathered from survey responses. For example, **how a role is designed** can\nswing total motivation by 87 points. A badly designed role results in ToMo\nscores as low as almost -40, whereas a well designed role can result in a ToMo\nas high as almost 50. That\u2019s huge, given that in many industries, the most-\nadmired cultures tend to have 15 points higher ToMo than their peers.\n\nSome companies make special efforts to design a highly motivating role. Toyota\nencourages play by giving factory workers the opportunity to come up with and\ntest [new tools and ideas](http://www.amazon.com/The-Toyota-Fieldbook-Jeffrey-\nLiker/dp/0071448934) on the assembly line. W. L. Gore & Associates gives\npeople [free time and resources](http://www.fastcompany.com/51733/fabric-\ncreativity) to develop new ideas. And Southwest Airlines encourages their\npeople to treat each customer interaction as play \u2014 perhaps you\u2019ve seen how\nsome flight attendants have turned boring safety announcements into [comedy\nsketches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07LFBydGjaM).\n\nThe next most sensitive element is the **identity** of an organization, which\nincludes its mission and behavioral code. For example, Medtronic enables its\nengineers and technicians to [see the medical devices](/2011/06/how-customers-\ncan-rally-your-troops) they\u2019ve made in action, so that they can see the\npurpose of their work. The Chief Talent Officer at UCB Pharmaceuticals told us\nhow he recently started inviting patients to executive meetings, so the people\nmaking decisions can see how their work makes a difference. And a Walmart\nexecutive told us that he kicked off management meetings by reviewing how much\nmoney his division had saved customers\u2014rather than how much money Walmart had\nmade.\n\nThe third most sensitive element is the **career ladder** in an organization.\nRecently, many companies have concluded that their system of evaluating their\npeople, which drives the promotion process, tends to destroy performance.\nSystems where employees are stack-ranked or rated against each other will\nincrease emotional and economic pressure, reducing total motivation and thus\nperformance. As a result, companies from [Microsoft](/2013/11/dont-rate-your-\nemployees-on-a-curve/) to [Lear](/2014/01/stop-basing-pay-on-performance-\nreviews) are moving away from performance review systems that foster unhealthy\ncompetition.\n\n**Culture is an ecosystem.** The elements of culture interact with and\nreinforce each other. One example is sales commissions. In general, we found\nthat having a sales commission decreases the ToMo of an individual. However,\nif that individual also believes that their work materially helps their\ncustomers, the commission _increases_ their ToMo. This makes sense through the\nlens of total motivation: if you don\u2019t believe in what you\u2019re doing, the\ncommission becomes your motive. That\u2019s low-ToMo. If you do believe in what\nyou\u2019re doing, the commission is gravy. It may even help you track your\nprogress, increasing play. That\u2019s high-ToMo.\n\n### What leaders can do\n\nLooking at all these processes together, it\u2019s clear that culture is the\noperating system of an organization. Senior leaders can build and maintain a\nhigh-performing culture by teaching managers to lead in highly motivating\nways. For example, one study of bank branch managers showed that offering\nhigh-ToMo leadership training led to a 20% increase in credit card sales and a\n47% increase in personal loan sales. CEOs should make a business case for\nculture (with a budget) and enlist HR and business leaders to improve the\nelements that affect culture, from role design to performance reviews.\n\nEven without redesigning processes, however, team leaders can start improving\nthe total motivation of their employees by:\n\n  1. Holding a reflection huddle with your team once a week. Teams we\u2019ve worked with hold an hour-long huddle once a week in which each person answers three questions directed at encouraging: 1) Play: What did I learn this week? 2) Purpose: What impact did I have this week? And 3) Potential: What do I want to learn next week?\n  2. Explaining the _why_ behind the work of your team. One executive at a retail store told us she often introduced a new project by saying, \u201cWe have to do this because Linda [the boss] asked for it.\u201d This was motivating through emotional pressure, which was hurting her team\u2019s performance. So she started explaining why a project would help the customer instead.\n  3. Considering how you\u2019ve designed your team\u2019s roles. Does everyone have a space to play? Think about where people should be free to experiment and make that clear. For example, a Starbucks manager told us that he lets each employee experiment with how they connect to each customer, and a bank manager we worked with said he encourages people to suggest process improvements. Then ask if everyone has the opportunity to witness the impact of their work, and think about what might help them build a stronger purpose. Finally, find out where each team member would like to be in two years \u2014 and come up with a plan to help their reach their potential.\n\nA great culture is not easy to build \u2014 it\u2019s why high performing cultures are\nsuch a powerful competitive advantage. Yet organizations that build great\ncultures are able to meet the demands of the fast-paced, customer-centric,\ndigital world we live in. More and more organizations are beginning to realize\nthat culture can\u2019t be left to chance. Leaders have to treat culture building\nas an engineering discipline, not a magical one.\n\n* * *\n\n[Lindsay McGregor](/search?term=lindsay%20mcgregor&search_type=search-all) is\nthe co-author of the _New York Times_ Bestseller, [_Primed to\nPerform_](http://amzn.com/0062373986) _,_ and the co-founder and CEO of\n[Vega](http://www.vegafactor.com/) Factor, a technology and consulting firm\ndedicated to ending low-performing cultures.

Region\nand industry are among the most germane external factors to keep in mind;\ncritical internal considerations include alignment with strategy, leadership,\nand organizational design.\n\n### Region.\n\nThe values of the national and regional cultures in which a company is\nembedded can influence patterns of behavior within the organization. (This\nlinkage has been explored in depth by Geert Hofstede and the authors of the\nGLOBE study.) We find, for example, that companies operating in countries\ncharacterized by a high degree of institutional collectivism (defined as\nvaluing equity within groups and encouraging the collective distribution of\nresources), such as France and Brazil, have cultures that emphasize _order_\nand _safety._ Companies operating in countries with low levels of uncertainty\navoidance (that is, they are open to ambiguity and future uncertainty), such\nas the United States and Australia, place a greater emphasis on _learning,\npurpose,_ and _enjoyment._ Such external influences are important\nconsiderations when working across borders or designing an appropriate\norganizational culture.\n\n![R1801B_SPOT_RANKINGBYINDUSTRYSTRATEGY](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/12/R1801B_SPOT_RANKINGBYINDUSTRYSTRATEGY.png)\n\n### Industry.\n\nVarying cultural attributes may be needed to address industry-specific\nregulations and customer needs. A comparison of organizations across\nindustries reveals evidence that cultures might adapt to meet the demands of\nindustry environments.\n\nOrganizational cultures in financial services are more likely to emphasize\n_safety._ Given the increasingly complex regulations enacted in response to\nthe financial crisis, careful work and risk management are more critical than\never in this industry. In contrast, nonprofits are far more purpose-driven,\nwhich can reinforce their commitment to a mission by aligning employee\nbehavior around a common goal.\n\n### Strategy.\n\nFor its full benefit to be realized, a culture must support the strategic\ngoals and plans of the business. For example, we find differences between\ncompanies that adopt a differentiation strategy and companies that pursue a\ncost leadership strategy. Although _results_ and _caring_ are key cultural\ncharacteristics at both types of companies, _enjoyment, learning,_ and\n_purpose_ are more suited to differentiation, whereas _order_ and _authority_\nare more suited to cost leadership. Flexible cultures--which emphasize\n_enjoyment_ and _learning_ --can spur product innovation in companies aiming\nto differentiate themselves, whereas stable and predictable cultures, which\nemphasize _order_ and _authority,_ can help maintain operational efficiency to\nkeep costs low.\n\nStrategic considerations related to a company's life cycle are also linked to\norganizational culture. Companies with a strategy that seeks to stabilize or\nmaintain their market position prioritize _learning,_ whereas organizations\noperating with a turnaround strategy tend to prioritize _order_ and _safety_\nin their efforts to redirect or reorganize unprofitable units.\n\n### Leadership.\n\nIt is hard to overestimate the importance of aligning culture and leadership.\nThe character and behaviors of a CEO and top executives can have a profound\neffect on culture. Conversely, culture serves to either constrain or enhance\nthe performance of leaders. Our own data from executive recruiting activities\nshows that a lack of cultural fit is responsible for up to 68% of new-hire\nfailures at the senior leadership level. For individual leaders, cultural fit\nis as important as capabilities and experience.\n\n### Organizational design.\n\nWe see a two-way relationship between a company's culture and its particular\nstructure. In many cases, structure and systems follow culture. For example,\ncompanies that prioritize teamwork and collaboration might design incentive\nsystems that include shared team and company goals along with rewards that\nrecognize collective effort. However, a long-standing organizational design\nchoice can lead to the formation of a culture. Because the latter is far more\ndifficult to alter, we suggest that structural changes should be aligned with\nthe desired culture.\n\n## The Leader\u2019s Guide to Corporate Culture\n\n  * [Boris Groysberg](/search?term=boris%20groysberg)\n  * [Jeremiah Lee](/search?term=jeremiah%20lee)\n  * [Jesse Price](/search?term=jesse%20price)\n  * [J. Yo-Jud Cheng](/search?term=j.%20yo-jud%20cheng)\n\n  * __Save\n  * __Share\n\nStrategy and culture are among the primary levers at top leaders' disposal in\ntheir never-ending quest to maintain organizational viability and\neffectiveness. Strategy offers a formal logic for the company's goals and\norients people around them. Culture expresses goals through values and beliefs\nand guides activity through shared assumptions and group norms.\n\nStrategy provides clarity and focus for collective action and decision making.\nIt relies on plans and sets of choices to mobilize people and can often be\nenforced by both concrete rewards for achieving goals and consequences for\nfailing to do so. Ideally, it also incorporates adaptive elements that can\nscan and analyze the external environment and sense when changes are required\nto maintain continuity and growth. Leadership goes hand-in-hand with strategy\nformation, and most leaders understand the fundamentals. Culture, however, is\na more elusive lever, because much of it is anchored in unspoken behaviors,\nmindsets, and social patterns.\n\nFor better _and_ worse, culture and leadership are inextricably linked.\nFounders and influential leaders often set new cultures in motion and imprint\nvalues and assumptions that persist for decades. Over time an organization's\nleaders can also shape culture, through both conscious and unconscious actions\n(sometimes with unintended consequences). The best leaders we have observed\nare fully aware of the multiple cultures within which they are embedded, can\nsense when change is required, and can deftly influence the process.\n\nUnfortunately, in our experience it is far more common for leaders seeking to\nbuild high-performing organizations to be confounded by culture. Indeed, many\neither let it go unmanaged or relegate it to the HR function, where it becomes\na secondary concern for the business. They may lay out detailed, thoughtful\nplans for strategy and execution, but because they don't understand culture's\npower and dynamics, their plans go off the rails. As someone once said,\nculture eats strategy for breakfast.\n\nIt doesn't have to be that way. Our work suggests that culture can, in fact,\nbe managed. The first and most important step leaders can take to maximize its\nvalue and minimize its risks is to become fully aware of how it works. By\nintegrating findings from more than 100 of the most commonly used social and\nbehavioral models, we have identified eight styles that distinguish a culture\nand can be measured. (We gratefully acknowledge the rich history of cultural\nstudies--going all the way back to the earliest explorations of human nature--\non which our work builds.) Using this framework, leaders can model the impact\nof culture on their business and assess its alignment with strategy. We also\nsuggest how culture can help them achieve change and build organizations that\nthrive in even the most trying times.\n\n## Defining Culture\n\nCulture is the tacit social order of an organization: It shapes attitudes and\nbehaviors in wide-ranging and durable ways. Cultural norms define what is\nencouraged, discouraged, accepted, or rejected within a group. When properly\naligned with personal values, drives, and needs, culture can unleash\ntremendous amounts of energy toward a shared purpose and foster an\norganization's capacity to thrive.\n\nCulture can also evolve flexibly and autonomously in response to changing\nopportunities and demands. Whereas strategy is typically determined by the\nC-suite, culture can fluidly blend the intentions of top leaders with the\nknowledge and experiences of frontline employees.\n\nAs someone once said, culture eats strategy for breakfast.\n\nThe academic literature on the subject is vast. Our review of it revealed many\nformal definitions of organizational culture and a variety of models and\nmethods for assessing it. Numerous processes exist for creating and changing\nit. Agreement on specifics is sparse across these definitions, models, and\nmethods, but through a synthesis of seminal work by Edgar Schein, Shalom\nSchwartz, Geert Hofstede, and other leading scholars, we have identified four\ngenerally accepted attributes:\n\n### Shared.\n\n####\n\nCulture is a group phenomenon. It cannot exist solely within a single person,\nnor is it simply the average of individual characteristics. It resides in\nshared behaviors, values, and assumptions and is most commonly experienced\nthrough the norms and expectations of a group--that is, the unwritten rules.\n\n### Pervasive.\n\nCulture permeates multiple levels and applies very broadly in an organization;\nsometimes it is even conflated with the organization itself. It is manifest in\ncollective behaviors, physical environments, group rituals, visible symbols,\nstories, and legends. Other aspects of culture are unseen, such as mindsets,\nmotivations, unspoken assumptions, and what [David Rooke and William Torbert\n](/2005/04/seven-transformations-of-leadership) refer to as \"action logics\"\n(mental models of how to interpret and respond to the world around you).\n\n### Enduring.\n\nCulture can direct the thoughts and actions of group members over the long\nterm. It develops through critical events in the collective life and learning\nof a group. Its endurance is explained in part by the attraction-selection-\nattrition model first introduced by Benjamin Schneider: People are drawn to\norganizations with characteristics similar to their own; organizations are\nmore likely to select individuals who seem to \"fit in\"; and over time those\nwho don't fit in tend to leave. Thus culture becomes a self-reinforcing social\npattern that grows increasingly resistant to change and outside influences.\n\n### Implicit.\n\nAn important and often overlooked aspect of culture is that despite its\nsubliminal nature, people are effectively hardwired to recognize and respond\nto it instinctively. It acts as a kind of silent language. Shalom Schwartz and\nE.O. Wilson have shown through their research how evolutionary processes\nshaped human capacity; because the ability to sense and respond to culture is\nuniversal, certain themes should be expected to recur across the many models,\ndefinitions, and studies in the field. That is exactly what we have discovered\nin our research over the past few decades.\n\n## Eight Distinct Culture Styles\n\nOur review of the literature for commonalities and central concepts revealed\ntwo primary dimensions that apply regardless of organization type, size,\nindustry, or geography: people interactions and response to change.\nUnderstanding a company's culture requires determining where it falls along\nthese two dimensions.\n\n### People interactions.\n\nAn organization's orientation toward people interactions and coordination will\nfall on a spectrum from highly independent to highly interdependent. Cultures\nthat lean toward the former place greater value on autonomy, individual\naction, and competition. Those that lean toward the latter emphasize\nintegration, managing relationships, and coordinating group effort. People in\nsuch cultures tend to collaborate and to see success through the lens of the\ngroup.\n\n### Response to change.\n\nWhereas some cultures emphasize stability--prioritizing consistency,\npredictability, and maintenance of the status quo--others emphasize\nflexibility, adaptability, and receptiveness to change. Those that favor\nstability tend to follow rules, use control structures such as seniority-based\nstaffing, reinforce hierarchy, and strive for efficiency. Those that favor\nflexibility tend to prioritize innovation, openness, diversity, and a longer-\nterm orientation. (Kim Cameron, Robert Quinn, and Robert Ernest are among the\nresearchers who employ similar dimensions in their culture frameworks.)\n\n#### The Eight Types of Company Culture\n\nBy applying this fundamental insight about the dimensions of people\ninteractions and response to change, we have identified eight styles that\napply to both organizational cultures and individual leaders. Researchers at\nSpencer Stuart (including two of this article's authors) have interdependently\nstudied and refined this list of styles across both levels over the past two\ndecades.\n\n_Caring_ focuses on relationships and mutual trust. Work environments are\nwarm, collaborative, and welcoming places where people help and support one\nanother. Employees are united by loyalty; leaders emphasize sincerity,\nteamwork, and positive relationships.\n\n_Purpose_ is exemplified by idealism and altruism. Work environments are\ntolerant, compassionate places where people try to do good for the long-term\nfuture of the world. Employees are united by a focus on sustainability and\nglobal communities; leaders emphasize shared ideals and contributing to a\ngreater cause.\n\n_Learning_ is characterized by exploration, expansiveness, and creativity.\nWork environments are inventive and open-minded places where people spark new\nideas and explore alternatives. Employees are united by curiosity; leaders\nemphasize innovation, knowledge, and adventure.\n\n_Enjoyment_ is expressed through fun and excitement. Work environments are\nlighthearted places where people tend to do what makes them happy. Employees\nare united by playfulness and stimulation; leaders emphasize spontaneity and a\nsense of humor.\n\n_Results_ is characterized by achievement and winning. Work environments are\noutcome-oriented and merit-based places where people aspire to achieve top\nperformance. Employees are united by a drive for capability and success;\nleaders emphasize goal accomplishment.\n\n_Authority_ is defined by strength, decisiveness, and boldness. Work\nenvironments are competitive places where people strive to gain personal\nadvantage. Employees are united by strong control; leaders emphasize\nconfidence and dominance.\n\n_Safety_ is defined by planning, caution, and preparedness. Work environments\nare predictable places where people are risk-conscious and think things\nthrough carefully. Employees are united by a desire to feel protected and\nanticipate change; leaders emphasize being realistic and planning ahead.\n\n_Order_ is focused on respect, structure, and shared norms. Work environments\nare methodical places where people tend to play by the rules and want to fit\nin. Employees are united by cooperation; leaders emphasize shared procedures\nand time-honored customs.\n\nThese eight styles fit into our integrated culture framework according to the\ndegree to which they reflect independence or interdependence (people\ninteractions) and flexibility or stability (response to change). Styles that\nare adjacent in the framework, such as _safety_ and _order,_ frequently\ncoexist within organizations and their people. In contrast, styles that are\nlocated across from each other, such as _safety_ and _learning,_ are less\nlikely to be found together and require more organizational energy to maintain\nsimultaneously. Each style has advantages and disadvantages, and no style is\ninherently better than another. An organizational culture can be defined by\nthe absolute and relative strengths of each of the eight and by the degree of\nemployee agreement about which styles characterize the organization. A\npowerful feature of this framework, which differentiates it from other models,\nis that it can also be used to define individuals' styles and the values of\nleaders and employees.\n\n#### Integrated Culture: The Framework\n\nOn the basis of decades of experience analyzing organizations, executives, and\nemployees, we developed a rigorous, comprehensive model to identify the key\nattributes of both group culture and individual leadership styles. Eight\ncharacteristics emerge when we map cultures along two dimensions: how people\ninteract (independence to interdependence) and their response to change\n(flexibility to stability). The relative salience of these eight styles\ndiffers across organizations, though nearly all are strongly characterized by\n_results_ and _caring._\n\nThe spatial relationships are important. Proximate styles, such as _safety_\nand _order,_ or _learning_ and _enjoyment,_ will coexist more easily than\nstyles that are far apart on the chart, such as _authority_ and _purpose,_ or\n_safety_ and _learning._ Achieving a culture of _authority_ often means\ngaining the advantages (and living with the disadvantages) of that culture but\nmissing out on the advantages (and avoiding the disadvantages) of a culture of\n_purpose._\n\n![R1801B_SPOT_FRAMEWORK](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/12/R1801B_SPOT_FRAMEWORK.png)\n\nFind this and other HBR graphics in our [Visual Library __](/visual-\nlibrary/2018/07/integrated-culture-the-framework)\n\nInherent in the framework are fundamental trade-offs. Although each style can\nbe beneficial, natural constraints and competing demands force difficult\nchoices about which values to emphasize and how people are expected to behave.\nIt is common to find organizations with cultures that emphasize both _results_\nand _caring,_ but this combination can be confusing to employees. Are they\nexpected to optimize individual goals and strive for outcomes at all costs, or\nshould they work as a team and emphasize collaboration and shared success? The\nnature of the work itself, the business strategy, or the design of the\norganization may make it difficult for employees to be equally _results_\nfocused and _caring._\n\nIn contrast, a culture that emphasizes _caring_ and _order_ encourages a work\nenvironment in which teamwork, trust, and respect are paramount. The two\nstyles are mutually reinforcing, which can be beneficial but can also present\nchallenges. The benefits are strong loyalty, retention of talent, lack of\nconflict, and high levels of engagement. The challenges are a tendency toward\ngroupthink, reliance on consensus-based decisions, avoidance of difficult\nissues, and a calcified sense of \"us versus them.\" Leaders who are more\nfocused on _results_ and _learning_ may find the combination of _caring_ and\n_order_ stifling when they seek to drive entrepreneurship and change. Savvy\nleaders make use of existing cultural strengths and have a nuanced\nunderstanding of how to initiate change. They might rely on the participative\nnature of a culture focused on _caring_ and _order_ to engage team members and\nsimultaneously identify a _learning_ -oriented \"insider\" who has the trust of\nhis or her peers to advocate for change through relationship networks.\n\n#### Integrated Culture: Leader Statements\n\nTop leaders and founders often express cultural sentiments within the public\ndomain, either intentionally or unintentionally. Such statements can provide\nimportant clues to how these leaders are thinking about and leading their\norganizations' cultures.\n\n![R1801B_SPOT_STATEMENTS](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/12/R1801B_SPOT_STATEMENTS.png)\n\n##### Learning: Tesla\n\n\"I'm interested in things that change the world or that affect the future and\nwondrous new technology where you see it and you're like 'Wow, how did that\neven happen?'\"  \n--Elon Musk, cofounder and CEO\n\n##### Purpose: Whole Foods\n\n\"Most of the greatest companies in the world also have great purposes\u2026.Having\na deeper, more transcendent purpose is highly energizing for all of the\nvarious interdependent stakeholders.\"  \n--John Mackey, founder and CEO\n\n##### Caring: Disney\n\n\"It is incredibly important to be open and accessible and treat people fairly\nand look them in the eye and tell them what is on your mind.\"  \n--Bob Iger, CEO\n\n##### Order: SEC\n\n\"Rule making is a key function of the commission. And when we are setting the\nrules for the securities markets, there are many rules we, the SEC, must\nfollow.\"  \n--Jay Clayton, chairman\n\n##### Safety: Lloyd's of London\n\n\"To protect themselves, businesses should spend time understanding what\nspecific threats they may be exposed to and speak to experts who can help.\"  \n--Inga Beale, CEO\n\n##### Authority: Huawei\n\n\"We have a 'wolf' spirit in our company. In the battle with lions, wolves have\nterrifying abilities. With a strong desire to win and no fear of losing, they\nstick to the goal firmly, making the lions exhausted in every possible way.\"  \n--Ren Zhengfei, CEO\n\n##### Results: GSK\n\n\"I've tried to keep us focused on a very clear strategy of modernizing\nourselves.\"  \n--Sir Andrew Witty, former CEO\n\n##### Enjoyment: Zappos\n\n\"Have fun. The game is a lot more enjoyable when you're trying to do more than\nmake money.\"  \n--Tony Hsieh, CEO\n\nThe eight styles can be used to diagnose and describe highly complex and\ndiverse behavioral patterns in a culture and to model how likely an individual\nleader is to align with and shape that culture. Using this framework and\nmultilevel approach, managers can:\n\n    * Understand their organization's culture and assess its intended and unintended effects\n    * Evaluate the level of consistency in employees' views of the culture\n    * Identify subcultures that may account for higher or lower group performance\n    * Pinpoint differences between legacy cultures during mergers and acquisitions\n    * Rapidly orient new executives to the culture they are joining and help them determine the most effective way to lead employees\n    * Measure the degree of alignment between individual leadership styles and organizational culture to determine what impact a leader might have\n    * Design an aspirational culture and communicate the changes necessary to achieve it\n\n## The Link Between Culture and Outcomes\n\nOur research and practical experience have shown that when you are evaluating\nhow culture affects outcomes, the context in which the organization operates--\ngeographic region, industry, strategy, leadership, and company structure--\nmatters, as does the strength of the culture. (See [\"Context, Conditions, and\nCulture.\"](/2018/01/context-conditions-and-culture)) What worked in the past\nmay no longer work in the future, and what worked for one company may not work\nfor another.\n\nWe have arrived at the following insights:\n\n### When aligned with strategy and leadership, a strong culture drives\npositive organizational outcomes.\n\nConsider the case of a best-in-class retailer headquartered in the United\nStates. The company had viewed its first priority as providing top-notch\ncustomer service. It accomplished this with a simple rule--Do right by the\ncustomer--that encouraged employees to use their judgment when providing\nservice. A core HR training practice was to help every salesperson see\ncustomer interactions as an opportunity to create \"service stories that become\nlegendary.\" Employees were reminded to define service from the customer's\nperspective, to constantly engage customers with questions geared toward\nunderstanding their specific needs and preferences, and to go beyond their\nexpectations.\n\nIn measuring the culture of this company, we found that like many other large\nretailers, it was characterized primarily by a combination of _results_ and\n_caring._ Unlike many other retailers, however, it had a culture that was also\nvery flexible, _learning_ oriented, and focused on _purpose._ As one top\nexecutive explained, \"We have freedom as long as we take good care of the\ncustomer.\"\n\nFurthermore, the company's values and norms were very clear to everyone and\nconsistently shared throughout the organization. As the retailer expanded into\nnew segments and geographies over the years, the leadership strove to maintain\nan intense customer focus without diluting its cherished culture. Although the\ncompany had historically focused on developing leaders from within--who were\nnatural culture carriers--recruiting outsiders became necessary as it grew.\nThe company preserved its culture through this change by carefully assessing\nnew leaders and designing an onboarding process that reinforced core values\nand norms.\n\nCulture is a powerful differentiator for this company because it is strongly\naligned with strategy and leadership. Delivering outstanding customer service\nrequires a culture and a mindset that emphasize achievement, impeccable\nservice, and problem solving through autonomy and inventiveness. Not\nsurprisingly, those qualities have led to a variety of positive outcomes for\nthe company, including robust growth and international expansion, numerous\ncustomer service awards, and frequent appearances on lists of the best\ncompanies to work for.\n\n### Selecting or developing leaders for the future requires a forward-looking\nstrategy and culture.\n\nThe chief executive of an agriculture business was planning to retire,\nspurring rumors about a hostile takeover. The CEO was actively grooming a\nsuccessor, an insider who had been with the company for more than 20 years.\nOur analysis revealed an organizational culture that strongly emphasized\n_caring_ and _purpose._ As one leader reflected, \"You feel like part of a\nlarge family when you become an employee at this company.\"\n\nThe potential successor understood the culture but was far more risk-averse (\n_safety_ ) and respectful of traditions ( _order_ ) than the rest of the\ncompany. Given the takeover rumors, top leaders and managers told the CEO that\nthey believed the company needed to take a more aggressive and action-oriented\nstance in the future. The board decided to consider the internal candidate\nalongside people from outside the company.\n\nCultural dynamics are a frequently overlooked factor in postmerger\nperformance.\n\nThree external candidates emerged: one who was aligned with the current\nculture ( _purpose_ ), one who would be a risk taker and innovative (\n_learning_ ), and one who was hard-driving and competitive ( _authority_ ).\nAfter considerable deliberation, the board chose the highly competitive leader\nwith the _authority_ style. Soon afterward an activist investor attempted a\nhostile takeover, and the new CEO was able to navigate through the precarious\nsituation, keep the company independent, and simultaneously begin to\nrestructure in preparation for growth.\n\n### In a merger, designing a new culture on the basis of complementary\nstrengths can speed up integration and create more value over time.\n\nMergers and acquisitions can either create or destroy value. Numerous studies\nhave shown that cultural dynamics represent one of the greatest yet most\nfrequently overlooked determinants of integration success and postmerger\nperformance.\n\nFor example, senior leaders from two merging international food retailers had\ninvested heavily in their organizations' cultures and wanted to preserve their\nunique strengths and distinct heritages. An assessment of the cultures\nrevealed shared values and areas of compatibility that could provide a\nfoundation for the combined culture, along with important differences for\nwhich leaders would have to plan: Both companies emphasized _results, caring,_\nand _order_ and valued high-quality food, good service, treating employees\nfairly, and maintaining a local mindset. But one operated in a more top-down\nmanner and scored much higher on _authority,_ especially in the behavior of\nleaders.\n\nBecause both companies valued teamwork and investments in the local community,\nthe leaders prioritized _caring_ and _purpose._ At the same time, their\nstrategy required that they shift from top-down _authority_ to a _learning_\nstyle that would encourage innovation in new-store formats and online\nretailing. As one senior leader said of the strategic aspiration, \"We need to\ndare to do things differently, not play by the old rule books.\"\n\nOnce they had agreed on a culture, a rigorous assessment process identified\nleaders at both organizations whose personal style and values would allow them\nto serve as bridges to and champions for it. Then a program was launched to\npromote cultural alignment within 30 top teams, with an emphasis on clarifying\npriorities, making authentic connections, and developing team norms that would\nbring the new culture to life.\n\nFinally, structural elements of the new organization were redesigned with\nculture in mind. A model for leadership was developed that encompassed\nrecruitment, talent assessment, training and development, performance\nmanagement, reward systems, and promotions. Such design considerations are\noften overlooked during organizational change, but if systems and structures\ndon't align with cultural and leadership imperatives, progress can be\nderailed.\n\n### In a dynamic, uncertain environment, in which organizations must be more\nagile, learning gains importance.\n\nIt's not surprising that _results_ is the most common culture style among all\nthe companies we have studied. Yet during a decade of helping leaders design\naspirational cultures, we have seen a clear trend toward prioritizing\n_learning_ to promote innovation and agility as businesses respond to\nincreasingly less predictable and more complex environments. And although\n_learning_ ranks fourth within our broader database, small companies (200\nemployees or fewer) and those in newer industries (such as software,\ntechnology, and wireless equipment) accord it higher values.\n\nConsider one Silicon Valley-based technology company we worked with. Though it\nhad built a strong business and invested in unique technology and top\nengineering talent, its revenue growth was starting to decline as newer,\nnimbler competitors made strides in a field exploding with innovation and\nbusiness model disruption. Company leaders viewed the culture as a\ndifferentiator for the business and decided to diagnose, strengthen, and\nevolve it. We found a culture that was intensely _results_ focused, team based\n( _caring_ ), and exploratory (a combination of _enjoyment_ and _learning_ ).\n\nAfter examining the overall business strategy and gaining input from\nemployees, leaders aimed for a culture that was even more focused on\n_learning_ and adopted our framework as a new language for the organization in\nits daily work. They initiated conversations between managers and employees\nabout how to emphasize innovation and exploration. Although it takes time to\nchange a culture, we found that the company had made notable progress just one\nyear later. And even as it prepared for an impending sale amid ever greater\ncompetition and consolidation, employee engagement scores were on the rise.\n\n### A strong culture can be a significant liability when it is misaligned with\nstrategy.\n\nWe studied a Europe-based industrial services organization whose industry\nbegan to experience rapid and unprecedented changes in customer expectations,\nregulatory demands, and competitive dynamics. The company's strategy, which\nhad historically emphasized cost leadership, needed to shift toward greater\nservice differentiation in response. But its strong culture presented a\nroadblock to success.\n\nWe diagnosed the culture as highly _results_ oriented, _caring,_ and _order_\nseeking, with a top-down emphasis on _authority._ The company's leaders\ndecided to shape it to be much more _purpose_ -driven, enabling, open, and\nteam based, which would entail an increase in _caring_ along with _learning_\nand _purpose_ and a decrease in _authority_ and _results._\n\nThis shift was particularly challenging because the current culture had served\nthe organization well for many years, while the industry emphasized efficiency\nand _results._ Most managers still viewed it as a strength and fought to\npreserve it, threatening success for the new strategic direction.\n\n#### The Pros and Cons of Culture Styles\n\nEvery culture style has strengths and weaknesses. The table below summarizes\nthe advantages and disadvantages of each style and how frequently it appears\nas a defining culture characteristic among the companies in our study.\n\n**CULTURE STYLE** | **ADVANTAGES** | **DISADVANTAGES** | **RANKED 1ST OR 2ND**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**CARING**  \nWarm, sincere, relational | Improved teamwork, engagement, communication,\ntrust, and sense of belonging | Overemphasis on consensus building may reduce\nexploration of options, stifle competitiveness, and slow decision making |\n\n## 63%  \n  \n**PURPOSE**  \nPurpose driven, idealistic, tolerant | Improved appreciation for diversity,\nsustainability, and social responsibility | Overemphasis on a long-term\npurpose and ideals may get in the way of practical and immediate concerns |\n\n## 9%  \n  \n**LEARNING**  \nOpen, inventive, exploring | Improved innovation, agility, and organizational\nlearning | Overemphasis on exploration may lead to a lack of focus and an\ninability to exploit existing advantages |\n\n## 7%  \n  \nENJOYMENT**  \nPlayful, instinctive, fun loving | Improved employee morale, engagement, and\ncreativity | Overemphasis on autonomy and engagement may lead to a lack of\ndiscipline and create possible compliance or governance issues |\n\n## 2%  \n  \nRESULTS**  \nAchievement driven, goal focused | Improved execution, external focus,\ncapability building, and goal achievement | Overemphasis on achieving results\nmay lead to communication and collaboration breakdowns and higher levels of\nstress and anxiety |\n\n## 89%  \n  \nAUTHORITY**  \nBold, decisive, dominant | Improved speed of decision making and\nresponsiveness to threats or crises | Overemphasis on strong authority and\nbold decision making may lead to politics, conflict, and a psychologically\nunsafe work environment |\n\n## 4%  \n  \nSAFETY**  \nRealistic, careful, prepared | Improved risk management, stability, and\nbusiness continuity | Overemphasis on standardization and formalization may\nlead to bureaucracy, inflexibility, and dehumanization of the work environment\n|\n\n## 8%  \n  \nORDER**  \nRule abiding, respectful, cooperative | Improved operational efficiency,\nreduced conflict, and greater civic-mindedness | Overemphasis on rules and\ntraditions may reduce individualism, stifle creativity, and limit\norganizational agility |\n\n## 15%  \n  \n**NOTE** SUM OF PERCENTAGES IS GREATER THAN 100 BECAUSE STYLES WERE COUNTED AS\nDOMINANT IF THEY WERE RANKED 1 OR 2 OVERALL. | (C)HBR.org  \n  \nCultural change is daunting for any organization, but as this company\nrealized, it's not impossible. The CEO introduced new leadership development\nand team coaching programs and training opportunities that would help leaders\nfeel more comfortable with cultural evolution. When people departed, the\ncompany carefully selected new leaders who would provide supporting values,\nsuch as _caring,_ and increased the emphasis on a shared _purpose._ The\nbenefits of this strategic and cultural shift took the form of an increasingly\ndiverse array of integrated service offerings and strong growth, particularly\nin emerging markets.\n\n## Four Levers for Evolving a Culture\n\nUnlike developing and executing a business plan, changing a company's culture\nis inextricable from the emotional and social dynamics of people in the\norganization. We have found that four practices in particular lead to\nsuccessful culture change:\n\n### Articulate the aspiration.\n\nMuch like defining a new strategy, creating a new culture should begin with an\nanalysis of the current one, using a framework that can be openly discussed\nthroughout the organization. Leaders must understand what outcomes the culture\nproduces and how it does or doesn't align with current and anticipated market\nand business conditions. For example, if the company's primary culture styles\nare _results_ and _authority_ but it exists in a rapidly changing industry,\nshifting toward _learning_ or _enjoyment_ (while maintaining a focus on\n_results_ ) may be appropriate.\n\nAn aspirational culture suggests the high-level principles that guide\norganizational initiatives, as at the technology company that sought to boost\nagility and flexibility amid increasing competition. Change might be framed in\nterms of real and present business challenges and opportunities as well as\naspirations and trends. Because of culture's somewhat ambiguous and hidden\nnature, referring to tangible problems, such as market pressures or the\nchallenges of growth, helps people better understand and connect to the need\nfor change.\n\n### Select and develop leaders who align with the target culture.\n\nLeaders serve as important catalysts for change by encouraging it at all\nlevels and creating a safe climate and what Edgar Schein calls \"practice\nfields.\" Candidates for recruitment should be evaluated on their alignment\nwith the target. A single model that can assess both organizational culture\nand individual leadership styles is critical for this activity.\n\nIncumbent leaders who are unsupportive of desired change can be engaged and\nre-energized through training and education about the important relationship\nbetween culture and strategic direction. Often they will support the change\nafter they understand its relevance, its anticipated benefits, and the impact\nthat they personally can have on moving the organization toward the\naspiration. However, culture change can and does lead to turnover: Some people\nmove on because they feel they are no longer a good fit for the organization,\nand others are asked to leave if they jeopardize needed evolution.\n\n### Use organizational conversations about culture to underscore the\nimportance of change.\n\nTo shift the shared norms, beliefs, and implicit understandings within an\norganization, colleagues can talk one another through the change. Our\nintegrated culture framework can be used to discuss current and desired\nculture styles and also differences in how senior leaders operate. As\nemployees start to recognize that their leaders are talking about new business\noutcomes--innovation instead of quarterly earnings, for example--they will\nbegin to behave differently themselves, creating a positive feedback loop.\n\nVarious kinds of organizational [conversations,](/2012/06/leadership-is-a-\nconversation) such as road shows, listening tours, and structured group\ndiscussion, can support change. Social media platforms encourage conversations\nbetween senior managers and frontline employees. Influential change champions\ncan advocate for a culture shift through their language and actions. The\ntechnology company made a meaningful change in its culture and employee\nengagement by creating a structured framework for dialogue and cultivating\nwidespread discussion.\n\n### Reinforce the desired change through organizational design.\n\nWhen a company's structures, systems, and processes are aligned and support\nthe aspirational culture and strategy, instigating new culture styles and\nbehaviors will become far easier. For example, performance management can be\nused to encourage employees to embody aspirational cultural attributes.\nTraining practices can reinforce the target culture as the organization grows\nand adds new people. The degree of centralization and the number of\nhierarchical levels in the organizational structure can be adjusted to\nreinforce behaviors inherent to the aspirational culture. Leading scholars\nsuch as Henry Mintzberg have shown how organizational structure and other\ndesign features can have a profound impact over time on how people think and\nbehave within an organization.\n\n## Putting It All Together\n\nAll four levers came together at a traditional manufacturer that was trying to\nbecome a full solutions provider. The change started with reformulating the\nstrategy and was reinforced by a major brand campaign. But the president\nunderstood that the company's culture represented the biggest barrier to\nchange and that the top leaders were the greatest lever for evolving the\nculture.\n\nThe culture was characterized by a drive for _results_ followed by _caring_\nand _purpose,_ the last of which was unusually strong for the industry. One\nemployee described the company as \"a talented and committed group of people\nfocused on doing good for the planet, with genuine desire, support, and\nencouragement to make a difference in the community.\" Whereas the broader\nculture was highly collaborative, with flat decision making, leaders were seen\nas top-down, hierarchical, and sometimes political, which discouraged risk\ntaking.\n\nThe top leaders reviewed their culture's strengths and the gaps in their own\nstyles and discussed what was needed to achieve their strategic aspirations.\nThey agreed that they needed more risk taking and autonomy and less hierarchy\nand centralized decision making. The president restructured the leadership\nteam around strong business line leaders, freeing up time to become a better\nadvocate for the culture and to focus more on customers.\n\n#### About the Research\n\nWe undertook a comprehensive study of organizational culture and outcomes to\nexplore the link between them. We analyzed the cultures of more than 230\ncompanies along with the leadership styles and values of more than 1,300\nexecutives across a range of industries (including consumer discretionary,\nconsumer staples, energy and utilities, financial and professional services,\nhealth care, industrials, and IT and telecommunications), regions (Africa,\nAsia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, Oceania, and South America), and\norganizational types (public, private, and nonprofit). We diagnosed those\ncultures using online survey responses from approximately 25,000 employees\ntogether with interviews of company managers.\n\nOur analysis highlighted how strongly each of the eight styles defined the\norganizations in our study. _Results_ ranked first, and _caring_ second. This\npattern is consistent across company types, company sizes, regions, and\nindustries. _Order_ and _learning_ ranked among the third and fourth most\ncommon styles in many cultures.\n\nCulture appears to most directly affect employee engagement and motivation,\nfollowed by customer orientation. To model its relationship to organizational\noutcomes, we assessed employee engagement levels for all the companies using\nwidely accepted survey questions and arrived at customer-orientation scores\nwith an online questionnaire. In many cases we also documented top leaders'\nindividual styles and values.\n\nWe found that employee engagement is most strongly related to greater\nflexibility, in the form of _enjoyment, learning, purpose,_ and _caring._\nSimilarly, we observed a positive relationship between customer orientation\nand those four styles plus _results._ These relationships, too, are\nsurprisingly consistent across companies. We also found that engagement and\ncustomer orientation are stronger when employees are in close agreement about\nthe culture's characteristics.\n\nOur research was influenced by the work of countless scholars in this field,\nmany of whom are mentioned in this article. In addition, we stand on the\nshoulders of giants such as David Caldwell, Jennifer Chatman, James Heskett,\nJohn Kotter, Charles O'Reilly, and many, many others who have inspired our\nthinking.\n\nThe top team then invited a group of 100 middle managers into the conversation\nthrough a series of biannual leadership conferences. The first one established\na platform for input, feedback, and the cocreation of an organizational change\nplan with clear cultural priorities. The president organized these managers\ninto teams focused on critical business challenges. Each team was required to\ngo outside the company to source ideas, to develop solutions, and to present\nits findings to the group for feedback. This initiative placed middle managers\nin change roles that would traditionally have been filled by vice presidents,\ngiving them greater autonomy in fostering a _learning_ -based culture. The\nintent was to create real benefits for the business while evolving the\nculture.\n\nThe president also initiated a program to identify employees who had positive\ndisruptive ideas and working styles. These people were put on project teams\nthat addressed key innovation priorities. The teams immediately began\nimproving business results, both in core commercial metrics and in culture and\nengagement. After only one year employee engagement scores jumped a full 10\npoints, and customer Net Promoter Scores reached an all-time high--providing\nstrong client references for the company's new and innovative solutions.\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nIt is possible--in fact, vital--to improve organizational performance through\nculture change, using the simple but powerful models and methods in this\narticle. First leaders must become aware of the culture that operates in their\norganization. Next they can define an aspirational target culture. Finally\nthey can master the core change practices of articulation of the aspiration,\nleadership alignment, organizational conversation, and organizational design.\nLeading with culture may be among the few sources of sustainable competitive\nadvantage left to companies today. Successful leaders will stop regarding\nculture with frustration and instead use it as a fundamental management tool.\n\n* * *\n\n[Boris Groysberg](/search?term=boris+groysberg) is the Richard P.

The best ones have some attributes in\ncommon: They align with the company's strategic direction; they're important\nto execute; and they reflect the demands of the external business environment.\nA good target should be both specific and achievable. For example, \"We value\nour customers\" can create ambiguity and lead to inconsistent choices regarding\nhiring, developing leaders, and running the company. A better version might be\n\"We build genuine and positive relationships with customers; we serve our\ncustomers with humility; and we act as ambassadors for our rich brand\nheritage.\"\n\n## To Set a Culture Target\n\n### Understand the Current Culture\n\nExamine your culture--the company's founding and heritage, its espoused\nvalues, subcultures, leadership style, and team dynamics. (Use the assessment\nin \"[What's Your Organization's Cultural Profile?](/2018/01/whats-your-\norganizations-cultural-profile)\" to start the conversation.)\n\nIdentify your culture's strengths and examine its impact on your organization\ntoday. Interview key stakeholders and influential members of the organization\nas needed.\n\n### Consider Strategy and the Environment\n\nAssess current and future external conditions and strategic choices and\ndetermine which cultural styles will need to be strengthened or diminished in\nresponse.\n\nFormulate a culture target according to which styles will support future\nchanges.\n\n### Frame the Aspiration in Business Realities\n\nTranslate the target into organizational change priorities. It should be\nframed not as a culture change initiative but in terms of real-world problems\nto be solved and solutions that create value.\n\nFocus on _leadership alignment, organizational conversations,_ and\n_organizational design_ as the levers to guide the culture's evolution.\n\n#### One Company's Experience\n\nOne large company used its search for a new director as an opportunity to\nbridge a problematic gap between the company's culture and the board's\nculture. To accomplish this, the leadership first diagnosed the two cultures\nalong with its aspirations for the new director.\n\n![R1801B_SPOT_ONECOMPANY_700px](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/12/R1801B_SPOT_ONECOMPANY_700px.png)\n\n![R1801B_SPOT_ONECOMPANY](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/12/R1801B_SPOT_ONECOMPANY.png)\n\nWhereas the company was highly _results_ oriented and focused on _order,_\ndiscipline, and execution, the board was far more _learning_ oriented,\nexploratory, inquisitive, and focused on _enjoyment._ A director who was\n_results_ driven and curious would help bridge the two cultures. Two years\nafter an individual with the desired style was brought in, the board and the\nmanagement team reported more-effective strategic planning activities and\nimproved company performance.\n\n* * *\n\n[Boris Groysberg](/search?term=boris+groysberg) is the Richard P.

In the two examples below,\neach dot represents one employee.\n\n![R1801B_SPOT_CONVERGENCE_700px](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/12/R1801B_SPOT_CONVERGENCE_700px.png)\n\n![R1801B_SPOT_CONVERGENCE](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/12/R1801B_SPOT_CONVERGENCE.png)\n\nNote that in the low-convergence organization, seven of the eight cultural\nattributes were cited as most important, and every quadrant is represented.\nThat means employees viewed their company in varying and often opposite ways.\nSome saw a _caring_ organization, for example, while others saw one that\nemphasized _authority._\n\nWhy is high convergence important? Because it correlates with levels of\nemployee engagement and customer orientation. However, if the culture you have\nis not the one you want, high convergence will make it harder to change.\n\n* * *\n\n[Boris Groysberg](/search?term=boris+groysberg) is the Richard P.

Region\nand industry are among the most germane external factors to keep in mind;\ncritical internal considerations include alignment with strategy, leadership,\nand organizational design.\n\n### Region.\n\nThe values of the national and regional cultures in which a company is\nembedded can influence patterns of behavior within the organization. (This\nlinkage has been explored in depth by Geert Hofstede and the authors of the\nGLOBE study.) We find, for example, that companies operating in countries\ncharacterized by a high degree of institutional collectivism (defined as\nvaluing equity within groups and encouraging the collective distribution of\nresources), such as France and Brazil, have cultures that emphasize _order_\nand _safety._ Companies operating in countries with low levels of uncertainty\navoidance (that is, they are open to ambiguity and future uncertainty), such\nas the United States and Australia, place a greater emphasis on _learning,\npurpose,_ and _enjoyment._ Such external influences are important\nconsiderations when working across borders or designing an appropriate\norganizational culture.\n\n![R1801B_SPOT_RANKINGBYINDUSTRYSTRATEGY](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/12/R1801B_SPOT_RANKINGBYINDUSTRYSTRATEGY.png)\n\n### Industry.\n\nVarying cultural attributes may be needed to address industry-specific\nregulations and customer needs. A comparison of organizations across\nindustries reveals evidence that cultures might adapt to meet the demands of\nindustry environments.\n\nOrganizational cultures in financial services are more likely to emphasize\n_safety._ Given the increasingly complex regulations enacted in response to\nthe financial crisis, careful work and risk management are more critical than\never in this industry. In contrast, nonprofits are far more purpose-driven,\nwhich can reinforce their commitment to a mission by aligning employee\nbehavior around a common goal.\n\n### Strategy.\n\nFor its full benefit to be realized, a culture must support the strategic\ngoals and plans of the business. For example, we find differences between\ncompanies that adopt a differentiation strategy and companies that pursue a\ncost leadership strategy. Although _results_ and _caring_ are key cultural\ncharacteristics at both types of companies, _enjoyment, learning,_ and\n_purpose_ are more suited to differentiation, whereas _order_ and _authority_\nare more suited to cost leadership. Flexible cultures--which emphasize\n_enjoyment_ and _learning_ --can spur product innovation in companies aiming\nto differentiate themselves, whereas stable and predictable cultures, which\nemphasize _order_ and _authority,_ can help maintain operational efficiency to\nkeep costs low.\n\nStrategic considerations related to a company's life cycle are also linked to\norganizational culture. Companies with a strategy that seeks to stabilize or\nmaintain their market position prioritize _learning,_ whereas organizations\noperating with a turnaround strategy tend to prioritize _order_ and _safety_\nin their efforts to redirect or reorganize unprofitable units.\n\n### Leadership.\n\nIt is hard to overestimate the importance of aligning culture and leadership.\nThe character and behaviors of a CEO and top executives can have a profound\neffect on culture. Conversely, culture serves to either constrain or enhance\nthe performance of leaders. Our own data from executive recruiting activities\nshows that a lack of cultural fit is responsible for up to 68% of new-hire\nfailures at the senior leadership level. For individual leaders, cultural fit\nis as important as capabilities and experience.\n\n### Organizational design.\n\nWe see a two-way relationship between a company's culture and its particular\nstructure. In many cases, structure and systems follow culture. For example,\ncompanies that prioritize teamwork and collaboration might design incentive\nsystems that include shared team and company goals along with rewards that\nrecognize collective effort. However, a long-standing organizational design\nchoice can lead to the formation of a culture. Because the latter is far more\ndifficult to alter, we suggest that structural changes should be aligned with\nthe desired culture.\n\n* * *\n\n[Boris Groysberg](/search?term=boris+groysberg) is the Richard P.

Currently, 50% of GE's 300,000\nemployees have been with the company for five years or less, meaning that they\nmay lack the personal networks needed to succeed and get ahead. The skills of\nGE's workforce have been rapidly changing as well, largely because of the\ncompany's ongoing transformation into a state-of-the-art digital industrial\norganization that excels at analytics. The good news is that GE has managed to\nattract thousands of digerati. The bad news is that they have little tolerance\nfor the bureaucracy of a conventional multinational. As is the case with\nyounger workers in general, they want to be in charge of their own careers and\ndon't want to depend solely on their bosses or HR to identify opportunities\nand figure out the training and experiences needed to pursue their\nprofessional goals.\n\nWhat's the solution to these challenges? GE hopes it's HR analytics. \"We need\na set of complementary technologies that can take a company that's in 180\ncountries around the world and make it small,\" says James Gallman, who until\nrecently was the GE executive responsible for people analytics and planning.\nThe technologies he's referring to are a set of self-service applications\navailable to employees, leaders, and HR. All the apps are based on a generic\nmatching algorithm built by data scientists at GE's Global Research Center in\nconjunction with HR. \"It's GE's version of Match.com,\" quips Gallman. \"It can\ntake a person and match him or her to something else: online or conventional\neducational programs, another person, or a job.\"\n\nAlong with Accenture, American Express, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Procter &\nGamble, GE is in the vanguard of the emerging field of workforce, or people,\nanalytics, says John Hausknecht, an associate professor of human resource\nstudies at Cornell University's ILR School. Here's how GE is using analytics\nto augment its core HR processes:\n\n## Career and Succession Planning\n\nThe tool for career and succession planning is the application that's furthest\nalong. GE launched it in early 2016 and significantly enhanced it in June\n2017. The app is embedded in the company's proprietary succession-planning\nplatform, used for those in executive roles. (A complementary career-explorer\nprogram in the employee portal helps salaried employees envision next career\nsteps.) Using data on the historical movement of GE employees and the\nrelatedness of jobs (which is based on their descriptions), the app helps\npeople uncover potential opportunities throughout the company, not just in\ntheir own business unit or geography. Lots of companies post open positions on\ntheir websites. What's different about this tool, says Gallman, is that it\nshows someone jobs that _aren 't _open so that he or she can see what might be\npossible in his or her GE career.\n\nLeaders can also use this tool to do better succession planning and career\ncoaching--by identifying nonobvious candidates, for instance. \"The algorithm\nhelps uncover great talent for every role in the company, irrespective of\nwhether people are male or female, diverse or not, introverts or extroverts,\nand so on,\" says Paul Davies, another HR executive at GE. \"So when we're\nthinking about who could possibly fill a particular role, we have a technology\nthat helps us come up with additional possibilities.\"\n\nThat said, the analytics system will complement, not replace, conversations\nabout professional development between employees and their bosses and HR\nmanagers. \"It is never going to be a tool that simply says, 'You do this job.\nYou take this class,'\" Gallman stresses. \"We just want to give people more\noptions and empower them to choose their own paths.\"\n\nCade Massey, a practice professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton\nSchool, believes that although using analytics for career and succession\nplanning is new, organizations will embrace it as they \"figure out that one of\nthe best ways to keep their people is to help them better understand other\nopportunities.\"\n\n## Training\n\nThis tool recommends the training or education someone needs to better perform\nhis or her existing job and to progress. Although still an early prototype, it\nhas been tested with hundreds of employees; perfecting it and rolling it out\ncompanywide in the next year is a high priority. The plan is to connect it to\na performance development app, now used by all salaried GE employees, that\ngives them a steady stream of constructive on-the-job feedback from their\nmanagers and team members. (See \"[GE's Real-Time Performance\nDevelopment.](/2015/08/ges-real-time-performance-development )\") The new tool\nwill read an individual's priorities and colleagues' suggestions for\nimprovement; match those with learning tools that others in the same country,\nlevel, and function have found useful; and offer options--for example,\nphysical or online classes or reading material.\n\n## High Potentials\n\nIn the mid-2000s, GE jettisoned the forced ranking of salaried employees, a\npractice instituted by Jack Welch, its CEO from 1981 to 2001. (He was famous\nfor insisting that people in the bottom 10% be fired.) Until mid-2016, the\ncompany (under Immelt) placed salaried employees into one of five categories:\nrole model, excellent, strong contributor, development needed, or\nunsatisfactory performer. That practice was then replaced with the system of\nproviding employees with a flow of constructive feedback. This, however,\ncreated a problem: how to identify superior performers and high potentials.\n\nUsing a technique called the Pareto frontier, the company's HR analytics team\nis trying to figure out how to draw on \"outcomes\" data--salary increases,\nbonuses, promotion rates, selections to attend roundtables with leaders or go\nthrough management development programs--to see who stands out from the crowd.\n\"We think this multidimensional approach will lead to better talent decisions\nthan any single attribute rating could deliver,\" Gallman says.\n\n## Networks\n\nThe purpose of this application, which is in the advanced prototype stage, is\nto help employees build a network. \"Knowledge work often depends on finding\nother people with particular skills to help you solve problems,\" Gallman says.\n\"This tool will allow people to understand where to go for that help. The best\npartner may not be your supervisor or your colleagues. That person may be on\nthe opposite side of the world and in a different business.\"\n\nGE used the app to help integrate the 11,000 employees of Alstom's power and\ngrid businesses and the 22,000 GE Power employees after the firm acquired the\nFrench company's divisions, in 2015. The system matched people with similar\nskills, education, and experiences; provided them with virtual collaboration\nspaces (WebEx meetings and GE's version of Google Hangouts); and suggested\ntopics for discussion. (What's hot in the industry right now? How did you\nenter the field? What excites you the most about the work ahead?)\n\n## Talent Retention\n\nThis application, which is in the \"test and validate\" stage, will predict,\nwithin a six-month window, when managers and professionals in a given function\n(say, software engineering, sales, or HR) are likely to jump ship so that GE\ncan intervene. It will identify circumstances under which people often quit--\nfor example, when someone on their team has recently left. It will then alert\nHR managers when such incidents occur so that they can encourage employees to\nstay. In this example, that might mean talking to remaining team members about\nthe next roles they might play.\n\n\"If we can reduce GE's average voluntary attrition rate--which, including\nretirees, is about 6%--by even a small amount, say one percentage point, it\nwould have enormous productivity implications,\" Davies says. For similar\nreasons, combating attrition is typically a top priority for many firms that\nlaunch people analytics programs, says Cornell's Hausknecht.\n\n## Cultural Change\n\nA final application, now in the early stages of development, would help GE\npinpoint aspects of its organizational structure that influence its drive to\nbecome a faster, nimbler organization with a greater focus on customer\noutcomes. For example, do people on big teams feel differently about the\ncompany than people on small teams do, and do they perform their jobs faster,\nthe same, or more slowly? How much does a team's distance from its business's\nheadquarters or its leader affect members and the amount of non-value-added\nwork they do? The HR team is using data from employee surveys, exit\ninterviews, and organizational design to try to understand such factors.\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nSome applications of people analytics will be especially difficult to perfect.\nThey include detecting high potentials and driving cultural change, because so\nmany factors are at play. But with the promise of the overall field so high,\nthe discipline is attracting companies of all sizes, eager to take on the\nchallenges. \"For many firms, talent is their most important asset--and\nhistorically, judgment around managing talent has been mostly intuitive and\nbiased,\" Massey says. \"There's no panacea, but as analytics progresses, it\noffers a chance to make more rigorous those intuitive methods and to de-bias\nsome of that judgment.\"\n\n## How I Remade GE\n\n  * [Jeffrey R. Immelt](/search?term=jeffrey%20r.%20immelt)\n\n  * __Save\n  * __Share\n\nA CEO has different tasks in different cycles. Some CEOs are founders and\nbuilders. Others have the luxury of managing momentum through a stable economy\nor a period when business models aren't being disrupted. My task was\ndifferent: remaking a historic and iconic company during an extremely volatile\ntime.\n\nI led a team of 300,000 people for 6,000 days. I led through recessions,\nbubbles, and geopolitical risk. I saw at least three \"black swan\" events. New\ncompetitors emerged, business models changed, and we ushered in an entirely\nnew way to invest. But we didn't just persevere; we transformed the company.\nGE is well positioned to win in the future.\n\nThe changes that took in the world from 2001, when I assumed the company's\nleadership, to 2017 are too numerous to mention. The task of the CEO has never\nbeen as difficult as it is today. In that vein, my story is one of progress\nversus perfection. The outcomes of my decisions will play out over decades,\nbut we never feared taking big steps to create long-term value.\n\nFor the past 16 years GE has been undergoing the most consequential makeover\nin its history. We were a classic conglomerate. Now people are calling us a\n125-year-old start-up--we're a digital industrial company that's defining the\nfuture of the internet of things. Change is in our DNA: We compete in today's\nworld to solve tomorrow's challenges. We have endured because we have the\ndetermination to shape our own future. Although we're still on the journey,\nwe've made great strides in revamping our strategy, portfolio, global\nfootprint, workforce, and culture. GE is famous for creating and religiously\nimplementing processes for managing virtually everything we do. The task of\ntransformation is no different. But my aim in this article--written on the eve\nof my announcement to transition the leadership of the company--is to share\nwhat I've learned more broadly about how to lead a giant organization through\nmassive changes. There are several lessons.\n\nFirst, you must be disciplined and focused. You need a point of view. Your\ninitiatives should be interconnected--and it's the leader's job to connect the\ndots for everyone in the organization. All the major initiatives we\nimplemented during my tenure as CEO were aimed at making GE one of the 21st\ncentury's most valuable technology-driven industrial companies--one that can\ngrow; one that can generate greater productivity for ourselves and our\ncustomers.\n\nThe second lesson concerns the journey a leader must embark on before\nundertaking a transformation. You have to go through a period of rewiring your\nbrain--getting yourself to the point of profoundly believing that the world is\nchanging and that the survival of your company depends on either anticipating\nthe change or being in the vanguard of those reacting to it.\n\nThird, you have to get people in your organization to see the need for change\nas existential. Fourth, you have to be all in--you must make a bold, sustained\ncommitment to the transformation.\n\nFifth, you must be resilient. I subscribe to the words of the great\nphilosopher Mike Tyson, who said, \"Everyone has a plan until they get punched\nin the mouth.\" It is so difficult to predict events. It is difficult to\nsustain transformation during tough times, but it's the only way to create a\nbetter future.\n\nSixth, during the transformation you have to listen and act at the same time.\nYou need to allow new thoughts to constantly come in, and you need to be open\nto the reality that your organization will have to pivot when it learns\nsomething new, while still having the courage to push people forward.\n\nFinally, you must embrace new kinds of talent, a new culture, and new ways of\ndoing things. We have hired tens of thousands of people--managers at all\nlevels; software developers and engineers; data scientists; and folks in\nsales, marketing, HR, and other functions--many of them outside the United\nStates. In 2001, 43% of our workforce was outside the United States; today 65%\nis.\n\nBefore delving into each lesson, I'll describe the transformations we've\nundertaken.\n\n## The Transformations\n\nDuring my time at the helm, we did five things that were transformative. We\nradically changed our portfolio by focusing on our core industrial businesses\nand divesting slower-growth, low-tech, and nonindustrial businesses (except\nfor the portion of GE Capital that supports our industrial businesses). We\nreestablished GE as a technology company: I more than doubled our investment\nin R&D. We became a truly global company, with a strong local presence in the\n180 countries we serve. We became a major force in the technologies that will\ndrive productivity in this era: the industrial internet and additive\nmanufacturing. And we made GE a vastly simpler company in terms of how it runs\n--it now has much less administration and shorter cycle times, is more\ndecentralized, and is more willing to let people deep in the organization who\nare close to their markets take risks without having to undergo multiple\nreviews.\n\n#### Five Transformations\n\nJeff Immelt introduced major, interconnected changes to GE's portfolio,\ninnovation strategy, global presence, strategic focus, and organizational\nmanagement.\n\n##### Portfolio\n\n###### From classic conglomerate to focused industrial conglomerate\n\nImmelt divested most nonindustrial and slower-growth industrial businesses and\ndoubled down on high-tech, manufacturing-based products and services. His\ndivestitures included financial services, media and entertainment, and major\nappliances. His acquisitions bolstered the remaining businesses and supported\nmoves into additive manufacturing and digital industrial.\n\n##### Innovation\n\n###### From M&A-driven diversification to tech-driven growth\n\nAs part of a drive to rekindle organic growth, GE made big bets on clean,\nenergy-efficient products; the industrial internet; and additive\nmanufacturing. They required major investments in new tech capabilities,\nparticularly software development. Research operations tripled during Immelt's\ntenure, to 10 centers worldwide. The R&D budget more than doubled, to $4.8\nbillion, and was maintained even in down years.\n\n##### Globalization\n\n###### From a U.S. focus to a global one\n\nIn response to slow growth in the developed world and faster growth in\nemerging markets, GE expanded its global presence. Leading the push was the\nGlobal Growth Organization, a group that gives local and regional managers far\nmore power to drive the growth of GE businesses in targeted countries. GE now\nconducts business in some 180 countries, up from about 100 in 2010, the year\nbefore the group was formed. In 2016, the revenues generated outside the U.S.\nby the company's existing industrial businesses amounted to $67 billion, or\n59% of their total--up from $46 billion, or 54% of their total, in 2010.\nDuring that time the number of GE employees outside the U.S. grew from\n154,000, or 54% of the total, to 191,000, or 65% of the total. And as of March\n31, 2017, $232 billion of GE's order backlog, or 72% of the total, was from\noutside the U.S.\n\n##### Strategic Focus\n\n###### From industrial to digital industrial\n\nImmelt saw that the source of competitive advantage in manufacturing was\nshifting from hardware to software and sensors embedded in the machines,\ncoupled with analytics. So he committed GE to making and servicing \"smart,\nconnected products.\" The company established a major software center in San\nRamon, California; created GE Digital as a new business; and launched the\nPredix platform, a contender to become the operating system for the industrial\ninternet. GE also acquired two additive-manufacturing companies and four\nsoftware firms, for a total of more than $3 billion.\n\n##### Organization\n\n###### From top-down to agile and decentralized\n\nGlobal growth, a new focus on software and outcomes for customers, the hiring\nof young digerati, and the need to reduce costs and free up resources for\nmajor investments required GE to become less hierarchical and more agile. It\ninitiated FastWorks, its version of the lean start-up approach. It switched\nfrom annual performance reviews to continuous development. And it replaced the\nGE Growth Values with the more dynamic and entrepreneurial GE Beliefs.\n\n-Steven Prokesch\n\nAll these transformations dovetailed to a certain extent. They were intended\nto focus us on creating value for customers by making our core businesses\nleaner, faster, more technical, and more global, and putting them on the\ncutting edge of the digital age. They have positioned the company to be more\nvaluable over time.\n\nEven before becoming CEO, I believed that the company couldn't simultaneously\nbe good at media, pet insurance, and making jet engines. We had come out of an\nera when many at GE believed that a good manager could manage anything. I\ndidn't buy that. I thought that companies--and business leaders--were good at\ncertain things.\n\nWhen I became CEO, the world was changing. The 9/11 tragedy had a dramatic\nimpact on several of our businesses. The power and pension bubbles--big\ndrivers of our earnings growth in the late 1990s--came to an abrupt end. And\nin the background, the Enron saga made transparency a priority for every\ncompany.\n\nOur portfolio was simply too broad and too opaque. One business had no idea\nwhat another business did. No one in leadership really understood the GE\nCapital balance sheet. And many of our industrial businesses had commoditized.\n\nAnother theme of our transformations was the desire to use our scale to drive\ngrowth and efficiency. I have long felt that nothing is worse than a big\ncompany that can't grow organically. I never wanted GE to be a $100-billion-\nplus company that had flatlined on organic growth. We conceptualized the GE\nStore, a global knowledge exchange. The idea is to build capabilities that can\nbe shared across our businesses: horizontal strengths that can be harnessed to\ncreate scale-based innovation and dominant global distribution.\n\nConnected to that were my beliefs that the days of 4% annual growth in the\ndeveloped economies were over and that the forces of economic nationalism\nwould only gain strength. When GDP is growing by 4% a year, no business is\nhard. When GDP is growing by 1% a year, no business is easy, so you've got to\nbe percolating new and different ideas. That meant figuring out how to\ninnovatively leverage technologies that would allow us and our customers to\nachieve leaps in productivity. And it meant getting into faster-growth parts\nof the world at scale.\n\nWe were a classic conglomerate. Now people are calling us a 125-year-old\nstart-up.\n\nFinally, simplification was all about reallocating resources to fund more\ngrowth and identify and solve customers' problems better. When companies are\nslow, it is typically a sign that their costs are in the wrong place. One of\nthe reasons big companies fail is that they don't think they can afford\nsomething and aren't willing to free up the resources to make bold moves. We\nare investing heavily in making GE a digital industrial company. Last year we\nput about $4 billion into developing our analytics software and machine-\nlearning capabilities and another $2 billion into building a leadership\nposition in additive-manufacturing equipment and services--an emerging field\nthat is going to revolutionize manufacturing. We had to run leaner in other\nplaces to make those investments.\n\nNow I'll turn to what I've learned about leading transformations.\n\n## Be Disciplined\n\nThe leader has to be disciplined about nesting initiatives within one another\n--showing how each one fits with the rest--and staying away from new ideas\nthat don't fit. For example, we couldn't do digital industrial until we'd\nfocused the portfolio, made the right investments in technology--which led to\na huge backlog of service agreements--and simplified the culture. When we talk\nabout becoming a digital industrial company and deepening our global presence,\nwe mean making the portfolio deeper, not broader.\n\nWe're now in the seventh year of our big digital-industrial initiative. To run\nthis play, we've had to have a constancy of purpose for a long period of time.\nIt's not a flavor of the month. We have hired thousands of people and invested\nbillions in technology.\n\nIf you look at my calendar, you'll see that I was tightly aligned with the\nfive transformations. How did I figure out which aspects of them to devote my\ntime to? Whichever needed the most change. I had to provide ballast against\nstagnation.\n\nGood CEOs absorb information all the time, but they don't instantly react.\n\nIn 2011 we launched our Global Growth Organization--a group charged with\ndramatically expanding our local presence in emerging markets, which has\nshared P&L responsibility for all GE businesses in many of those economies. I\nasked John Rice, one of our best leaders, to move to Hong Kong to head it, and\nI personally spent almost 50% of the next year in growth regions. There was a\nlot of disagreement among our leaders about who had control over what and what\nit would mean to run a business in, say, Brazil if we were going to have a\nhorizontal global organization. My role was to make sure it was a healthy\ntension and that we stayed focused on the outcome.\n\n## Soak\n\nGood leaders, good CEOs, are curious. They are absorbing information about\npotentially important trends and developments all the time, but they don't\ninstantly react to them. They contemplate them. They read about them. They\nlisten to internal and external experts with a variety of perspectives. They\nengage in what I call a \"soak period\" before they reach a conclusion about\nwhat the input means for their company and how to act on it. A leader needs a\nlong soak period mainly because of the tremendous amount of personal fortitude\nrequired to drive lasting change in a big organization. You must be profoundly\nconvinced that the company must transform itself--that it's a matter of life\nor death--because when you start the play, you will immediately get pushback.\n\nMy soak period that led to our globalization initiative is a good example. GE\nhas always been a pretty global company (defined as an American company that\nsells around the world). But with the divergent growth coming out of the\nfinancial crisis, we needed a more aspirational approach. We wanted a company\nthat was capable of having a higher market share globally than we had in the\nUnited States.\n\nAt the time, free-trade deals were still the coin of the realm: The prevailing\nview was that the United States was going to have trade deals with Europe and\nthe Pacific Rim countries. I disagreed. I felt that people wanted jobs in\ntheir own country. Jobs are currency. Although I didn't think protectionism\nwas the answer and believed we needed better-defined, fairer trade deals, I\ndidn't see that happening anytime soon.\n\nSometimes while you are soaking, a single event can compel you to act. In 2010\nI was sitting in a hotel restaurant in Ghana with two great young leaders on\nour Africa team. They were describing a big opportunity in the power industry,\nbut it was complicated. I was in love with their passion, but I realized that\neven if I spent the next month helping them, we would not get the deal\napproved inside GE. And I ran the place!\n\nAfter that meeting I went to the board and got its support for creating the\nGlobal Growth Organization. Fundamentally, that put the horizontal operations\nin regions on par with the vertical businesses. It made them responsible for\nsales and marketing, R&D, and manufacturing in their territories. It allowed\nthe regional organizations to act faster and be more responsive to local\ncustomers' needs while still taking advantage of our global scale.\n\nAnother example is our ongoing drive to become the leader in the digital\nindustrial space--a transformation we launched in 2011. It originated in my\nmeetings with customers in 2008 and 2009. I started my career in sales, and I\nhave always spent a lot of time on the road. So I've always had a healthy\ndisrespect for headquarters, which I still have today. When you spend time on\nthe road, you get more opportunities for soaking, for learning.\n\nI continued that practice even after becoming CEO. Every month I spent six or\neight days out of the country and two days in the field in the United States,\nsitting down with our sales teams and the people in customer organizations who\nwere making the decisions to purchase our products and services. The purpose\nwas not only to get somebody to buy a new power turbine, jet engine, or MRI\nmachine but also to learn what people were contending with, how their\nbusinesses were changing, and how they were using our products and trying to\nget more out of them--how they were trying to drive productivity.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/08/R1705B_IMMELT.jpg)\n\nTony Luong\n\nI remember spending time with some of our locomotive customers, such as BNSF\nand Norfolk Southern. In the rail industry, one mile per hour of velocity is\nworth hundreds of millions of dollars in profit. We were experimenting with\nsimple analytical tools, and our customers encouraged us to do more and get\nbigger. They reminded me that help making progress on operational technology\nwould be worth more to them than our products. I started to worry that if GE\nwasn't providing it to them, someone else would, and we'd lose a big edge in\nthe market. That sparked the realization that what had upended traditional\nincumbents in one industry after another could occur in the industrial sector,\nand that once the digital revolution was under way, playing catch-up wouldn't\nwork.\n\nStarting in 2009, over the course of several years I visited our controls and\nanalytics labs and spent time in Silicon Valley. As the CEO of GE, I could get\nthe best people in a field to talk to me about what was going on. I always\ncapitalized on that. I met with tech leaders including Jeff Bezos, of Amazon;\nPaul Otellini, of Intel; Marc Benioff, of Salesforce; and Steve Ballmer (and\nlater, Satya Nadella), of Microsoft, and had dinners with venture capitalists.\nI listened to them describe where they were going and how they went from\nstrength to strength. I also read a lot. The two things that influenced me the\nmost were Marc Andreessen's 2011 Wall Street Journal article, \"[Why Software\nIs Eating the\nWorld,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460)\"\nand [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/book)--Eric Ries's book,\nwhich I literally read in a day.\n\nIn 2011 we decided to hire Bill Ruh from Cisco to lead our industrial internet\neffort; to establish a major software center in San Ramon, California, that\nwould support the transformation; and to insist from day one that we would\ninfuse the effort with outside talent--our original goal was to hire a\nthousand software engineers. Those decisions have led us to where we are\ntoday. They had their roots in the days when I ran our health care business,\nfrom 1996 to 2000. I had wanted it to be more digital but made the mistake of\nletting the health IT business be run by GE people who didn't have enough\nexternal focus. As a result, we didn't get as much traction as I'd wanted. I\nhad reflected on that for more than a decade.\n\nI've mainly been talking about what I did personally, but I think this kind of\nleadership bleeds into the organization. The people running GE businesses\ntoday are more curious and much more externally focused than in the past.\nFrequently I'd say in a meeting, \"Hey, I've got half an idea. Can anybody grab\nit?\" More often than not, one of the people who did was Beth Comstock, one of\nour vice chairs. (For example, she and our CIO, Jim Fowler, are taking the\nlead in exploring blockchain's potential impact on GE.) Keith Sherin, who\nserved as CFO and then as the head of GE Capital before retiring last year;\nJeff Bornstein, our current CFO; and John Rice, our vice chairman who heads\nour Global Growth Organization, are also adept at that. Our information\nmechanisms, such as the marketing organization and the growth playbook\nprocess, which is our strategic-planning method for ensuring that we're\ndisciplined in pursuing organic growth, support these explorations.\n\nWhen you get to the point where you believe to your core that things have\nfundamentally changed--when you feel that if we don't do it, it's going to get\ndone to us--it's time to act and to engage the organization.\n\n## Make It Existential\n\nEvery time we drove a big change, I treated it as if it were life or death. If\nyou can instill that psychology in your management group, you can get\ntransformation.\n\nI taught twice a month in the executive development programs at our\nCrotonville campus, in Ossining, New York, where I could reach people three or\nfour levels down in the organization. When there, I might say, \"Guys, if we\ndon't become the best technology company in the world, we're doomed, we're\ndead.\" And when I talked about digital industrial, I'd say, \"There's no Plan\nB. There's no other way to get there. Who's coming with me? What's in your\nway? What do we need to be doing differently?\"\n\nI communicated the message repeatedly--at the yearly meeting, in August, of\nour corporate officers (200 senior executives who lead the company's large\nrevenue-generating businesses or are in top technology or functional roles);\nthe gathering, in January, of our 600 to 700 officers and senior executives;\nthe quarterly corporate executive council attended by our top 40 leaders; and\ntown hall sessions in Beijing and Shanghai. I did webcasts and wrote about the\ntransformations in internal blogs and our annual report.\n\nI always laugh when people in business or politics think they're going to give\none speech and everybody's going to say, \"OK, I've got it. I'll go with you.\"\nI still want to be the best salesperson in the company. I'll knock on doors\nand say, \"Let me just give you one more pitch.\"\n\nI allowed people to express reservations and concerns, but I didn't make\nparticipation optional. I didn't give people an out. We've got lots of\nmechanisms, including our organizational structure and our pay and performance\nreview system, to make sure everyone gets with the program. There are now\ndedicated digital organizations inside each business. The leaders of the\nbusiness and its digital organization have shared metrics that determine part\nof their compensation. We have reviews every 60 days. And individual\nbusinesses' obligations to carry out the transformations are in everybody's\ngrowth playbook. For globalization, we measure each business on how many\nexecutives it has in emerging markets. If the leader of a business had 17 and\nwas supposed to have 20, I'd demand to know the reason. We take all the\narteries of process in the company and align them to drive change.\n\nAnother crucial way I enlisted people in the cause was by forging personal\nrelationships. One weekend a month, a GE officer and his or her spouse would\nhave dinner with my wife, Andrea, and me at our home. The next morning, I'd\nspend four hours talking with him or her. I'd say, \"Tell me what's important\nin your business. What do you think we should do at GE? What are you working\non? What else do you want to do?\" Those weekends were a way to hear\nperspectives I might not get otherwise. In addition, they gave me a chance,\nperson by person, to build deep connections, which are important in driving\nchange.\n\n## Be All In\n\nHalf measures are death for big companies, because people can smell lack of\ncommitment. When you undertake a transformation, you should be prepared to go\nall the way to the end. You've got to be all in. You've got to be willing to\nplop down money and people. You won't get there if you're a wuss. Look at the\nbillions of dollars we've invested in our digital capabilities and additive\nmanufacturing.\n\nYou can't regard a transformation as an experiment. We've approached digital\nvery differently from the way other industrial and consumer products companies\nhave. Most say, \"We'll take an equity stake in a digital start-up, and that is\nour strategy.\" To my mind, that's dabbling. I wanted to get enough scale fast\nenough to make it meaningful. My view was that GE had as good a chance as\nanybody at winning in the industrial internet, because we were not starting\nfrom scratch: We had a $240 billion installed base of service contracts, a\nhuge order backlog, and the ability to offer financing. We could build on our\nexisting strengths to get even better.\n\nSo we launched digital across all our businesses. By that I mean we launched a\nmajor effort to embed sensors in our products and build an analytics\ncapability to help our customers learn from the data that the sensors\ngenerated. Initially we focused on increasing the productivity of their\nservice contracts--for example, improving the uptime, or the time on wing, of\nour jet engines and reducing the turnaround time for overhauls. After that we\nbuilt new capabilities in our businesses and started selling them to our\nexisting customers--helping them use analytics the way we did. Then we built\nthe Predix platform, which we aimed to make the operating system for the\nindustrial internet.\n\nWe also went all in with our move into additive manufacturing, or 3-D printing\n--which I see as part of the digital industrial transformation. We had been\nworking on additive manufacturing for applications inside the company for five\nor six years--maybe 10 years in terms of developing materials for it. We're a\nbig user of it in our aviation, transportation, energy, and health care\nbusinesses, maybe the biggest on the metallics side. In the spring of 2016 we\nstarted to talk about making additive manufacturing a stand-alone business:\nproviding machines, materials, and expertise to a range of industries, even\nbeyond the ones we compete in.\n\nWe could see a way to automate it. We could see it being very disruptive--\nmaking what we want, where we want, with workers who are more productive and\nmore valuable. We gave a presentation to our board last summer. Because I was\nso close to the initiative, it was helpful to see members' high level of\nengagement and to hear their reflections on how disruptive it could be. Within\n30 days of that meeting we acquired two companies for a billion and a half\ndollars: Arcam, which specializes in electron-beam melting systems, and\nConcept Laser, which specializes in powder-bed-based laser metal printing.\nBoth print metal parts for aircraft and other industrial components. They gave\nGE a market share of about 20% in the additive-equipment market.\n\nEven for a company our size, once you make a move like that, you're committed.\nYou're investing serious money. You're driving it across the company. You have\na sales force. You have products. You're willing to change your business model\nby doing business with competitors and opening up the system to your\ncustomers. That is change.\n\nFinally, total commitment means insisting that people get with the program.\nThe good thing about the GE culture is that nine times out of 10, people are\ngoing to say, \"Hey, let's try it. Let's see where it goes.\" But inevitably a\nhandful will resist. That's why it's important to be jogging--to have momentum\n--when you meet opposition and inertia.\n\nWhen we created the Global Growth Organization, I told the executives in\ncharge of our businesses, \"Look, to get global, we've got to be more local. So\nwe're going to run the company as a full-fledged matrix where the regions have\npower.\" A few of our best leaders couldn't deal with that process. They were\nused to running a very vertical slice of a P&L, and the world was becoming\nmore horizontal. I said, \"When you fight with the guy in Riyadh from now on,\nhe's going to win sometimes.\" And they said, \"Well, that's not really the way\nI want to do it.\" I appreciated their honesty but decided they had to go.\n\n## Be Resilient\n\nTransformation requires staying power. At GE, we had a pretty good track\nrecord of investing through a crisis, particularly in technology and\nglobalization. For example, we doubled our investment in commercial engine\ntechnology from 2009 to 2012. Our competitors did not. That explains why at\nthis year's Paris Air Show we booked $30 billion in orders and our competitors\nbooked about a couple billion.\n\nSimilarly, last year the annual revenue generated by our China health care\nbusiness surpassed $2 billion. That's up from virtually nothing when I ran the\nbusiness in the late 1990s! Now we have a strong local business with deep\nlocal talent. We are respected by Chinese customers and the government. But we\ndidn't achieve our current position easily. We had to persevere: Whenever one\ndoor closed, we opened another.\n\nI believe that energy storage and solar technologies are critical to GE's\nfuture. But pursuing them hasn't been easy. In the past five years we have\nwritten off more than $300 million of our investments in battery and thin-film\nsolar technology. This is not failure; it has made us smarter.\n\nI hate to say it, but transformation takes time. If change is easy, it is not\nsustainable. You need a thick skin to see it through. In the capital markets,\ntwo ideas--unlocking value and creating value--get thrown around almost as if\nthey were interchangeable, but they are not. Unlocking value frequently means\nstrategic capitulation for short-term gain. Creating value is the result of\nlong-term investing--for example, when M&A activity to acquire technology or\nmarket access or position is ultimately connected to a longer-term value\nproposition. It's harder to appreciate such moves if you're using only a\nshort-term lens.\n\nI led GE during the financial crisis. Those were very lonely days. Despite our\nportfolio work, our financial services businesses were still too big in 2008,\nwhen Lehman Brothers went down. It was my fault. But we didn't stop or point\nfingers. Most of the aviation engine technology that is allowing us to gain\nshare today is a result of investments we made during the financial crisis. We\nfixed the problems. And a better company emerged.\n\nTransformation takes grit. It requires risk taking. Many large companies\nchange their CEOs every three to five years; GE's CEOs have tenures that are a\nmultiple of that. This is because driving change at scale is an imperfect\nscience. It takes time and resiliency.\n\n## Be Willing to Pivot\n\nOne of the hardest challenges in driving change is allowing new information to\ncome in constantly and giving yourself the chance to adapt while still having\nthe courage to act and push people forward. There's a tension: Even as you're\nmaking a major commitment of resources, you've got to be open to pivoting on\nthe basis of what you learn, because you're unlikely to get the strategy\nperfect out of the gate. Nothing we've done has ever turned out exactly as it\nbegan.\n\nWhen you undertake a transformation, you've got to be all in--you can't be a\nwuss.\n\nWhen we started the digital industrial move, I had no thought of creating the\nPredix platform business. None. We had started this analytical apps\norganization. Three years later some of the people we had hired from Microsoft\nsaid, \"Look, if you're going to build this app world, that's OK. But if you\nwant to really get the value, you've got to do what Microsoft did with Windows\nand be the platform for the industrial internet.\" That meant we would have to\ncreate our own ecosystem; open up what we were doing to partners, developers,\ncustomers, and noncustomers; and let the industry embrace it. For the first\nfour or five months when those guys were pushing the platform idea, I said to\nthem, \"Hey, just do your jobs. We've got enough going on right now.\" But I was\nreading and learning. Finally I was persuaded and said, \"Hey, you know what,\nguys? You were right. Let's go.\" So we pivoted. Again we went all the way. We\nnot only increased our investment in digital by an order of magnitude--a\nbillion dollars--but also told all our businesses, \"We're going to sunset all\nour other analytics-based software initiatives and put everybody on Predix,\nand we're going to have an open system so that your competitors can use it\njust like you can.\"\n\nAnother thing we learned was the need to sell outcomes as a service, rather\nthan sell a product and a service contract. That's not something we were\nbrought up to do. We learned it from software vendors and from listening to\ncustomers talk about what it would take for them to become Predix customers.\nOur partnership with Hubco illustrates this approach. That company has the\nlargest independent steam power plant in Pakistan, about 1.3 gigawatts. We're\ntargeting around $120 million in value creation from fuel savings alone--with\nminimal changes to the plant's existing hardware.\n\nWhen we started simplification, we thought it would be only about delayering--\ngetting rid of bureaucracy and streamlining processes. Two or three years in,\nwe learned that what was probably most important was transparency--giving\npeople data online so that they could see how they were doing.\n\nAnd about five years into the effort to invest heavily in technology, we\ndecided it was too centralized. To drive globalization, that had to change. So\nwe opened research centers in Shanghai, Munich, and Rio.\n\nOne of the things I've said during every transformation is, \"We're on a\n40-step journey. Today we're on step 22. I don't know exactly what step 32\nlooks like yet. But we're going to explore that together. And we will do\nwhatever it takes to be successful. We're going to win.\"\n\nThere's a broader leadership point. Even on my floor of GE headquarters, the\npeople I worked with wanted to go home every night with all the answers in\ntheir briefcases. I went home every night knowing I had none of the answers\nyet and that it was OK to let things come to you. My wife and I watch The\nBridge, a Scandinavian murder-mystery series on Netflix. Each season has 10\nepisodes. During the second episode of one season, my wife said, \"Who did it?\nWho do you think did it?\" And I said, \"Honey, just let it come to you.\" You\nneed people who are willing to stick around to the eighth or ninth episode and\njust let more of it come their way.\n\n## Embrace New Kinds of Talent\n\nA company our age simply couldn't do the things we're trying to do with our\ncore population. We needed a cadre of people who hadn't grown up in the\ncompany. That required me to protect those people until they were truly\nintegrated and to be open to building a new culture, new ways of doing things,\nand new thoughts.\n\nIf you look at GE today, there are more senior people from outside the company\nthan at any time in our history. As noted, Bill Ruh, the leader of GE Digital,\ncame from Cisco. Ganesh Bell, the chief digital officer of GE Power, worked at\nSAP. Both Jerome Pecresse, who leads our renewable energy business, and\nPhilippe Cochet, our chief productivity officer, joined GE through our\nacquisition of Alstom.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2016, the number of people hired from outside GE each year\n(excluding acquisitions) increased by more than 60%. And the number of\nexternal hires added annually to our executive ranks more than doubled, to\n160.\n\nI have made GE a highly adaptable organization, and I expect our leaders to\nserve as models. David Joyce, who has spent his entire career in GE Aviation\nand has led that business since 2008, is now also in charge of GE Additive.\nJamie Miller, who joined 10 years ago as our controller and then became our\nCIO, now heads GE Transportation. Terri Bresenham, who joined GE as an Edison\nEngineer, now leads Sustainable Healthcare Solutions out of India. The\nbusiness she's building is focused on improving health care access and quality\nin emerging markets; it's designed to be disruptive and operates with minimal\ninput from headquarters.\n\nWith each transformation we made new heroes. When we began the technology\ntransformation, early on in my tenure as CEO, more corporate officers were\nlawyers than were engineers; that's changed. In 2001 only 20% of our officers\nwere women, were from outside the United States, or were U.S. minorities. The\nfigure now is 59%. We are thinking about talent and culture in new ways\nthrough our accelerated leadership program, XLP, and our initiative to build a\nworkforce of 20,000 women in engineering and technology jobs by 2020. If you\nsee our TV ad aimed at attracting women to STEM roles, you'll notice that\nwe're celebrating scientists as well.\n\nThe digital industrial transformation has been the hardest one, because we had\nto import a couple thousand people who had grown up in different companies and\ncultures. We still have a lot of work to do to fully integrate them. We still\nhave an industrial camp and a digital camp in the company.\n\nThe leader has to defend a new group for as long as it takes for the core\nculture to pivot so that unification takes place. For example, a guy in GE\nAviation once complained to me, \"Predix doesn't have all the features I want\nright now.\" Understanding that creating good software is an iterative process,\nI reminded him that when GE Aviation designed the GEnx engine, which powers\nBoeing's 747-8 jetliner and 787 Dreamliner, it designed the low-pressure\nturbine wrong the first time. \"You've got to be more supportive of your\ncolleagues,\" I admonished him.\n\nYou can't have a transformation without revamping the culture and the\nestablished ways of doing things. In our case, that has meant choosing speed\nover bureaucracy and killing the bureaucracy, employing new ways to recruit\ntalent, and retaining the best people by giving them an opportunity to lead.\n\nWe have changed--and are continuing to change--our culture and operating\nrhythm enormously. We've radically changed our values, which are integrated\ninto everything we do, including our language, to signal that we are in the\nmiddle of a reinvention. For example, one of our old Growth Values was\n\"external focus.\" It underscored the importance of collaborating with\ncustomers and other stakeholders, but it wasn't dynamic. Contrast that with\ntwo new GE Beliefs, \"Customers determine our success\" and \"Deliver results in\nan uncertain world.\" They are much more aspirational, forward-focused, and\naction-oriented. The speed and entrepreneurial spirit you see in the company\ntoday reflect the GE Beliefs.\n\nWhen the cadence of the business is so much faster, having anything that's\nannual makes no sense. So now that we iterate on a lot of our products\ncontinuously, we also iterate on the way we talk to one another about careers,\nstrategy, and business outcomes. For example, we got rid of our legendary\nSession C process for succession planning--an annual ritual that had barely\nchanged since its introduction, in the 1970s--and made those conversations\nmuch more frequent; we now call them \"people days.\" We turned our performance\nmanagement process, whose focus had been on rating people, into a continuous\nperformance-development approach, whose focus is on giving people the feedback\nthey want and need to produce better outcomes for customers.\n\nWe also dramatically simplified the growth playbook strategic-planning process\nthat we did twice a year, making it a more frequent dialogue about how we are\npursuing organic growth. And with the help of Eric Ries and others, we\ninvented FastWorks, an adaptation of his Lean Startup method for developing\nproducts that can be applied to our kinds of big-ticket offerings.\n\nThis is still very much a process-driven company. But what's changed since the\n1990s is that in a protectionist, slow-growth world, you can't succeed just by\nexcelling in a process like Six Sigma. It's banking big ideas that will get\nyou there. Process is the means to methodically achieving great ideas at\nscale; it's important, but it's not an end itself. Companies get into trouble\nwhen process--not outcomes for customers--becomes the endgame.\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nMy legacy at GE will be a complicated one. In our core businesses, earnings\nhave tripled during my tenure. Our $324 billion backlog is up more than $150\nbillion in the past decade. We have record-high market share. Our financial\nperformance has outpaced that of our peers over the past five years. We have\npaid more in dividends during my tenure than during the previous 110 years of\nGE history combined. Nonetheless, our P/E ratio has gone from 40:1 to 17:1 in\nthe past decade, and the stock price has underperformed. Thus it is with\ntransformation. At GE we are never in episode 10.\n\nIt will take years for GE to fully reap the benefits of the transformations.\nBut as I contemplate my departure, I love where the company is positioned. I\nlove what we're targeting. The company in 2001 was certain that the future\nwould look like the past. The company in 2017 is ready for any future. I'm\nconfident that I'm handing over a company that will flourish in the 21st\ncentury. Some people at GE feel that the stock market doesn't fully appreciate\nwhat we've accomplished. But I look at it this way: Our task now is just to\nperform, to execute, and let the market make its own judgment.\n\n* * *\n\n[Jeffrey R.

Such companies commonly adopt a\nmatrix structure--and then find it frustratingly difficult to manage. Bringing\nthe local voice into a global business is a daunting challenge.\n\nThe difficulty arises in part from the way CEOs think about the problem. Many\nsee the global-local dichotomy as a continuum on which firms must choose the\noptimal point. They resign themselves to a journey of endless reorganizations\nas they struggle to find that point. The result is often widespread infighting\nand inertia.\n\nBut Immelt understood that it doesn't have to be a zero-sum game; a company\ncan be both global and local. That is especially true now, thanks to\ntechnological advances. Software has made customizing global products easier\nand much less expensive than before. And new manufacturing technologies--\nincluding 3-D printing, robots, analytics, and sensor-laden internet-connected\nequipment--are reducing the minimum scale necessary to produce cost-\neffectively, making it possible to build factories that serve markets locally.\nInstead of constantly searching for the optimal point on the continuum, the\ngoal should be turning underserved high-potential regions into important\nmarkets for the global businesses, eliminating the need to create a formal P&L\nstructure in a country. It's not an easy shift--nothing about managing global\ncompanies is easy--but it's possible.\n\nSince the launch of GE's Global Growth Organization (GGO), in January 2011,\nthe revenues generated outside the United States by GE's existing industrial\nbusinesses have grown to $67 billion, or 59% of their worldwide total, from\n$46 billion, or 54% of their total. Even more telling is their order backlog\noutside the United States. During that same time frame, it has grown to $232\nbillion, or 72% of their total, from $112 billion, or 64% of their total--a\nsign that the contribution of businesses outside the United States will grow\nenormously in coming years. Despite these huge strides, GE's leaders would be\nthe first to admit that the globalization effort is still a work in progress.\nNonetheless, other multinationals can glean several important lessons from\nGE's experience.\n\n### Give the local organizations clout.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges is finding ways to give local operations a\nvoice. This is especially true at companies such as GE, whose global\nbusinesses have historically called the shots and used regional operations\nprimarily as sales organizations. In such firms, smaller sales regions that\nlack influence are often unable to persuade their global operations to fund\ngrowth initiatives.\n\nAn extreme way to give local operations a voice is to award local managers P&L\nresponsibility for all the company's businesses in their country or region and\nto have all the businesses' personnel answer to both the country and the\nbusiness leaders. GE took this approach to jump-start growth in select\nregions, such as India. But recognizing that one size doesn't fit all, it\ndidn't do so in other markets, including China.\n\nAnd Immelt did something even more radical: He appointed one of GE's most\nrespected senior leaders--John Rice, a vice chairman who had run several GE\nbusinesses--to lead the GGO. Immelt made the GGO jointly responsible with the\nglobal businesses for increasing their sales outside the United States, but\nits priority was high-potential markets. What's more, he gave Rice carte\nblanche to recruit strong leaders from anywhere in the company. Rice tapped\nseasoned senior managers from the global businesses and functions--people with\nsolid experience and strong networks. Many had track records in aggressively\npursuing growth, and all were people who could command the respect of GE's\nglobal business and function heads. These qualities helped them understand and\ndefuse the businesses' concerns when dealing with contentious issues. They\ncould get things done by influence rather than confrontation.\n\nUnderstanding that roles at the local organizations are dead-end jobs in many\nmultinationals, Immelt and Rice advertised that the opposite would be true at\nGE. Many managers in emerging markets went on to important positions in the\ncompany. The most noteworthy is John Flannery: After leading GE's business in\nIndia, he oversaw corporate acquisitions and divestitures, headed GE's health\ncare business, and ultimately succeeded Immelt as CEO.\n\nImmelt personally reviewed the plans for areas deemed growth markets. Although\nhe encouraged constructive conflict, he intervened in battles that threatened\nto impede progress and removed resisters in the global businesses. \"He made\nsure everybody understood that this mission was a one-way street,\" Rice says.\n\n### Embrace creative abrasion.\n\nIt is no secret that matrix organizations generate conflicts that can\nimmobilize operations and suck up managers' time. Immelt and his team\nrecognized that the creation of the GGO would generate heat and were ready to\naccept it in the hope of channeling it to positive ends.\n\nMoving an organization in this direction--toward what Harvard Business\nSchool's Dorothy Leonard calls \"creative abrasion\"--is no easy undertaking. It\nhelps to find leaders who have walked in the other side's shoes and can see\nthe other's argument in an empathetic light.\n\nGE did this in a number of ways. In addition to transferring senior managers\nto the GGO from the businesses and the functions, after a time it transferred\nregional leaders to the businesses. Separately, Rice and his leadership team\nsought to clarify roles in the regional and global organizations, establishing\nframeworks and thresholds for decision making in areas such as pricing,\nfinancing, hiring, and performance reviews. They also took pains to ensure\nthat the regional staff supported, rather than hindered, people from the\nglobal businesses in interfacing with customers.\n\n### Build strong functions.\n\nA chronic problem plaguing the operations of multinationals in underserved\nregions is a lack of strong local talent--individual global businesses often\nfeel they can't afford to invest in it. GE was no exception, and Rice and his\nteam recognized early on the importance of tackling that deficiency. For\nexample, they saw that without a robust HR function in the regions, they\nwouldn't be able to recruit, develop, and retain local talent. Consequently,\nan early priority was putting together a strong functional leadership team in\ngrowth regions outside the United States to build capabilities in HR, finance,\nIT, sales and marketing, communications, and legal.\n\nIn some cases the GGO's leaders persuaded the global businesses to foot the\nbill to augment local teams; in others the GGO hired people on its own. The\nGGO also created \"centers of excellence\" that could provide functional\nexpertise to local businesses that might not be big enough to afford it or to\nattract the best people.\n\n### Eliminate strategic blind spots.\n\nThe metrics typically used to assess the success of mature businesses (annual\nsales increases, profit margins, cost reductions) often blind companies to a\nnew market's long-term potential. In addition, individual global businesses'\nfocus on their own results can blind them to the collective opportunity in a\nmarket: A small opportunity for any single business might become a big\nopportunity for the company as a whole.\n\nTo avoid these pitfalls, Immelt gave the GGO a budget not only to hire people\nbut to take on projects on its own, and he encouraged it to act as a catalyst\nfor cross-business collaboration. For example, the GGO funded a highly\nflexible \"multimodal\" factory in Pune, India, which could make a variety of\nproducts for different businesses, and the development of such products as a\nwind turbine for the German market and an affordable magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI) machine for China. Over time it persuaded businesses to cofund\nefforts, and as successes mounted, the businesses became more willing to join\nin.\n\nIn addition, Rice had each regional leader size up the potential of his or her\nmarket, create a three-year growth plan, and install metrics (for example,\ngrowth in orders) to track the region's progress in exploiting its\nopportunities. Regional managers' incentives were tied to their success in\nhitting the growth targets. Initially, the global businesses' and the regions'\nconflicting metrics generated friction. This led to healthy debate between\nbusiness and GGO teams about growth and profit trade-offs and sparked\ncollaboration to find the optimal balance. The GGO never pursued deals that\nthe global business leaders did not support or ones that did not meet minimum\nmargin targets. Immelt and Rice saw the friction as a positive: It forced both\nsides to understand the other's point of view and, over time, brought everyone\ntogether on a \"OneGE\" team with a shared purpose: growing the company's\noverall position in the market and achieving profitability.\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nIt's increasingly common for individual managers in the regions to wear two\nhats: one for the business and one for the region. For instance, Rachel Duan\nruns GE China and the health care business in China. New structures--such as\nregional councils in which leaders of the businesses and the functions meet\nperiodically to share goals for local markets and figure out how they can\ncollaborate to achieve them--have taken root. More measurements are shared,\nand the global organizations and the GGO now all work seamlessly together on\nbig deals. \"Our global organizations have become more horizontal and over time\nwill become even more so,\" Immelt says.\n\nIndia, which was the pilot for the GGO, is now a major market for GE, and\ncollaboration among GE businesses there is the norm. Heartened by this\nsuccess, Immelt and Rice decided that as of January 2017, the Indian\noperations had matured and no longer needed to function as an independent P&L.\n\"The added complexity of a P&L structure now outweighs its benefits,\" says\nBanmali Agrawala, the country's current GGO leader. \"We feel we have the right\ntalent and systems in place to function effectively without the P&L\nstructure.\"\n\nFor his part, Rice sees the GGO remaining a lean organization but not\ndisappearing anytime soon. \"We continually ask ourselves if we have the right\nresources in the right places, at the right time and focused on the right\nthings. We need to figure out the best business model for each region and\nensure that we balance empowerment with sufficient guardrails. We need to\nfigure out what we are missing, where we should go faster. We need to look for\nthe next tipping point.\"\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2009/05/110-Ranjay-Gulati.jpg)\n\n[Ranjay Gulati](/search?term=ranjay+gulati) is the Jaime and Josefina Chua\nTiampo Professor of Business Administration, the head of the organizational\nbehavior unit, and the chair of the Advanced Management Program at Harvard\nBusiness School.\n\n* * *\n\n## Reinventing Talent Management\n\n  * [Steven Prokesch](/search?term=steven%20prokesch)\n\n  * __Save\n  * __Share\n\n![Tony Luong](/resources/images/article_assets/2017/08/R1705B_SPOT_TOC3-.jpg)\n\nTony Luong\n\nDuring Jeff Immelt's 16 years as CEO, GE radically changed its mix of\nbusinesses and its strategy.\n\nIts focus--becoming a truly global, technology-driven industrial company\nthat's blazing the path for the internet of things--has had dramatic\nimplications for the profile of its workforce. Currently, 50% of GE's 300,000\nemployees have been with the company for five years or less, meaning that they\nmay lack the personal networks needed to succeed and get ahead. The skills of\nGE's workforce have been rapidly changing as well, largely because of the\ncompany's ongoing transformation into a state-of-the-art digital industrial\norganization that excels at analytics. The good news is that GE has managed to\nattract thousands of digerati. The bad news is that they have little tolerance\nfor the bureaucracy of a conventional multinational. As is the case with\nyounger workers in general, they want to be in charge of their own careers and\ndon't want to depend solely on their bosses or HR to identify opportunities\nand figure out the training and experiences needed to pursue their\nprofessional goals.\n\nWhat's the solution to these challenges? GE hopes it's HR analytics. \"We need\na set of complementary technologies that can take a company that's in 180\ncountries around the world and make it small,\" says James Gallman, who until\nrecently was the GE executive responsible for people analytics and planning.\nThe technologies he's referring to are a set of self-service applications\navailable to employees, leaders, and HR. All the apps are based on a generic\nmatching algorithm built by data scientists at GE's Global Research Center in\nconjunction with HR. \"It's GE's version of Match.com,\" quips Gallman. \"It can\ntake a person and match him or her to something else: online or conventional\neducational programs, another person, or a job.\"\n\nAlong with Accenture, American Express, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Procter &\nGamble, GE is in the vanguard of the emerging field of workforce, or people,\nanalytics, says John Hausknecht, an associate professor of human resource\nstudies at Cornell University's ILR School. Here's how GE is using analytics\nto augment its core HR processes:\n\n## Career and Succession Planning\n\nThe tool for career and succession planning is the application that's furthest\nalong. GE launched it in early 2016 and significantly enhanced it in June\n2017. The app is embedded in the company's proprietary succession-planning\nplatform, used for those in executive roles. (A complementary career-explorer\nprogram in the employee portal helps salaried employees envision next career\nsteps.) Using data on the historical movement of GE employees and the\nrelatedness of jobs (which is based on their descriptions), the app helps\npeople uncover potential opportunities throughout the company, not just in\ntheir own business unit or geography. Lots of companies post open positions on\ntheir websites. What's different about this tool, says Gallman, is that it\nshows someone jobs that _aren 't _open so that he or she can see what might be\npossible in his or her GE career.\n\nLeaders can also use this tool to do better succession planning and career\ncoaching--by identifying nonobvious candidates, for instance. \"The algorithm\nhelps uncover great talent for every role in the company, irrespective of\nwhether people are male or female, diverse or not, introverts or extroverts,\nand so on,\" says Paul Davies, another HR executive at GE. \"So when we're\nthinking about who could possibly fill a particular role, we have a technology\nthat helps us come up with additional possibilities.\"\n\nThat said, the analytics system will complement, not replace, conversations\nabout professional development between employees and their bosses and HR\nmanagers. \"It is never going to be a tool that simply says, 'You do this job.\nYou take this class,'\" Gallman stresses. \"We just want to give people more\noptions and empower them to choose their own paths.\"\n\nCade Massey, a practice professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton\nSchool, believes that although using analytics for career and succession\nplanning is new, organizations will embrace it as they \"figure out that one of\nthe best ways to keep their people is to help them better understand other\nopportunities.\"\n\n## Training\n\nThis tool recommends the training or education someone needs to better perform\nhis or her existing job and to progress. Although still an early prototype, it\nhas been tested with hundreds of employees; perfecting it and rolling it out\ncompanywide in the next year is a high priority. The plan is to connect it to\na performance development app, now used by all salaried GE employees, that\ngives them a steady stream of constructive on-the-job feedback from their\nmanagers and team members. (See \"[GE's Real-Time Performance\nDevelopment.](/2015/08/ges-real-time-performance-development )\") The new tool\nwill read an individual's priorities and colleagues' suggestions for\nimprovement; match those with learning tools that others in the same country,\nlevel, and function have found useful; and offer options--for example,\nphysical or online classes or reading material.\n\n## High Potentials\n\nIn the mid-2000s, GE jettisoned the forced ranking of salaried employees, a\npractice instituted by Jack Welch, its CEO from 1981 to 2001. (He was famous\nfor insisting that people in the bottom 10% be fired.) Until mid-2016, the\ncompany (under Immelt) placed salaried employees into one of five categories:\nrole model, excellent, strong contributor, development needed, or\nunsatisfactory performer. That practice was then replaced with the system of\nproviding employees with a flow of constructive feedback. This, however,\ncreated a problem: how to identify superior performers and high potentials.\n\nUsing a technique called the Pareto frontier, the company's HR analytics team\nis trying to figure out how to draw on \"outcomes\" data--salary increases,\nbonuses, promotion rates, selections to attend roundtables with leaders or go\nthrough management development programs--to see who stands out from the crowd.\n\"We think this multidimensional approach will lead to better talent decisions\nthan any single attribute rating could deliver,\" Gallman says.\n\n## Networks\n\nThe purpose of this application, which is in the advanced prototype stage, is\nto help employees build a network. \"Knowledge work often depends on finding\nother people with particular skills to help you solve problems,\" Gallman says.\n\"This tool will allow people to understand where to go for that help. The best\npartner may not be your supervisor or your colleagues. That person may be on\nthe opposite side of the world and in a different business.\"\n\nGE used the app to help integrate the 11,000 employees of Alstom's power and\ngrid businesses and the 22,000 GE Power employees after the firm acquired the\nFrench company's divisions, in 2015. The system matched people with similar\nskills, education, and experiences; provided them with virtual collaboration\nspaces (WebEx meetings and GE's version of Google Hangouts); and suggested\ntopics for discussion. (What's hot in the industry right now? How did you\nenter the field? What excites you the most about the work ahead?)\n\n## Talent Retention\n\nThis application, which is in the \"test and validate\" stage, will predict,\nwithin a six-month window, when managers and professionals in a given function\n(say, software engineering, sales, or HR) are likely to jump ship so that GE\ncan intervene. It will identify circumstances under which people often quit--\nfor example, when someone on their team has recently left. It will then alert\nHR managers when such incidents occur so that they can encourage employees to\nstay. In this example, that might mean talking to remaining team members about\nthe next roles they might play.\n\n\"If we can reduce GE's average voluntary attrition rate--which, including\nretirees, is about 6%--by even a small amount, say one percentage point, it\nwould have enormous productivity implications,\" Davies says. For similar\nreasons, combating attrition is typically a top priority for many firms that\nlaunch people analytics programs, says Cornell's Hausknecht.\n\n## Cultural Change\n\nA final application, now in the early stages of development, would help GE\npinpoint aspects of its organizational structure that influence its drive to\nbecome a faster, nimbler organization with a greater focus on customer\noutcomes. For example, do people on big teams feel differently about the\ncompany than people on small teams do, and do they perform their jobs faster,\nthe same, or more slowly? How much does a team's distance from its business's\nheadquarters or its leader affect members and the amount of non-value-added\nwork they do? The HR team is using data from employee surveys, exit\ninterviews, and organizational design to try to understand such factors.\n\n### CONCLUSION\n\nSome applications of people analytics will be especially difficult to perfect.\nThey include detecting high potentials and driving cultural change, because so\nmany factors are at play. But with the promise of the overall field so high,\nthe discipline is attracting companies of all sizes, eager to take on the\nchallenges. \"For many firms, talent is their most important asset--and\nhistorically, judgment around managing talent has been mostly intuitive and\nbiased,\" Massey says. \"There's no panacea, but as analytics progresses, it\noffers a chance to make more rigorous those intuitive methods and to de-bias\nsome of that judgment.\"\n\n* * *\n\n[Steven Prokesch](/search?term=steven+prokesch) is a senior editor at _Harvard\nBusiness Review_.\n\n* * *\n\nREAD 3 PIECES IN THIS PACKAGE __\n\nHow I Remade GE\n\nGE\u2019s Global Growth Experiment\n\nReinventing Talent Management\n\n#### Partner Center\n\n[Coronavirus](/insight-center/coronavirus) [Magazine](/magazine)\n[Popular](/most-popular) [Topics](/topics) [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n[Video](/video) [Store](/store) [The Big Idea](/big-ideas) [Visual\nLibrary](/visual-library) [Reading Lists](/reading-lists) [Case\nSelections](/case-selections)\n\n[![Harvard Business Review Home](/resources/css/images/hbr_logo.svg)](/)\n\n[**Subscribe**](/subscribe)\n\n###### Explore HBR\n\n  * [The Latest](/the-latest)\n  * [Most Popular](/most-popular)\n  * [All Topics](/topics)\n  * [Magazine Archive](/magazine)\n  * [The Big Idea](/big-ideas)\n  * [Reading Lists](/reading-lists)\n  * [Case Selections](/case-selections)\n  * [Video](/video)\n  * [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n  * [Webinars](/webinars)\n  * [Visual Library](/visual-library)\n  * [My Library](/my-library)\n  * [Newsletters](/email-newsletters)\n  * [HBR Ascend](https://hbrascend.org/)\n\n###### HBR Store\n\n  * [Article Reprints](/store/articles)\n  * [Books](/store/books)\n  * [Cases](/store/case-studies)\n  * [Collections](/store/collections)\n  * [Magazine Issues](/store/magazine-issues)\n  * [HBR Guide Series](/store/landing/guides)\n  * [HBR 20-Minute Managers](/store/landing/20-minute-managers)\n  * [HBR Emotional Intelligence Series](/store/landing/emotional-intelligence-series)\n  * [HBR Must Reads](/store/landing/mustreads)\n  * [Tools](/store/tools)\n\n###### About HBR\n\n  * [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n  * [Advertise with Us](/hbr-advertising-sales)\n  * [Information for Booksellers/Retailers](/booksellers-retailers)\n  * [Masthead](/about-hbr)\n  * [Global Editions](/global-editions)\n  * [Media Inquiries](/media-inquiries)\n  * [Guidelines for Authors](/guidelines-for-authors-web)\n  * [HBR Analytic Services](/hbr-analytic-services)\n\n###### HBR Subscriber Assistance\n\n  * [Subscribe](/subscribe)\n  * [Subscriber Help](/subscriber-help)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.274.3214](tel:+18002743214)  \n[harvard@cdsfulfillment.com](mailto:harvard@cdsfulfillment.com)  \n[hbr.org/subscriberservices](/subscriberservices)\n\n  * International:  \n[+44.1858.438.412](tel:+441858438412)  \n[(Asia Pacific: +61.2.9158.6127)](tel:+61291586127)  \n[hbr@subscription.co.uk](mailto:hbr@subscription.co.uk)  \n[subscription.co.uk/hbr/help](https://www.subscription.co.uk/hbr/help)\n\n###### HBR.ORG Customer Assistance\n\n  * [Help Center](/help-customer-service-home)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.988.0886](tel:+18009880886)\n\n  *   * International:  \n[617.783.7500](tel:+16177837500)\n\n  * Email:  \n[customerservice@harvardbusiness.org](mailto:customerservice@harvardbusiness.org)\n\n  * [Copyright Permissions](/permissions)\n\n###### Follow HBR\n\n  * __[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/HBR)\n  * __[Twitter](http://twitter.com/HarvardBiz)\n  * __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review?trk=biz-companies-cym)\n  * __[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harvard_business_review/?hl=en)\n  * __[Your Newsreader](http://feeds.hbr.org/harvardbusiness/)\n\n![Harvard Business Publishing](/resources/images/2018/new_logo_May11.png)\n\n  * [About Us](/corporate/about)\n  * [Careers](/corporate/careers)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n  * [Copyright Information](/corporate/copyright)\n  * [Trademark Policy](http://trademark.harvard.edu/pages/trademark-notice)\n\n  \n\nHarvard Business Publishing:\n\n  * [Higher Education](http://hbsp.harvard.edu/)\n  * [Corporate Learning](http://www.harvardbusiness.org)\n  * [Harvard Business Review](http://hbr.org/)\n  * [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Harvard Business School Publishing.

Dave didn\u2019t advocate any particular design model,\njust one the leader knows how to employ and one flexible enough to be applied\nto the range of organizational situations a leader faces in the course of a\ncareer.\n\nOnce upon a time, \u201corganization design\u201d meant bringing in a slew of\nconsultants to oversee a large-scale organizational restructuring, most often\nintended to take out big chunks of cost during an economic downturn. Although\nthat kind of redesign is still required periodically, leaders today are more\ntypically confronted with the challenge of how to find cost efficiencies in\ncertain parts of their organization to invest in other parts of the\norganization that drive growth. As a result, organization design is no longer\njust a big bang event. Rather it\u2019s an on-going nipping and tucking of\norganizational resources to achieve both growth and efficiency at multiple\nlevels: the company overall, the operating group level, and even within\nfunctional groups like human resources and information technology. So leaders\nat many different levels need to get in on the act.\n\nIf, as Dave suggests, there isn\u2019t any ideal design model, then how does one\nchoose an approach to designing an organization that is robust enough to\naddress the dual goals of achieving efficiency and investing in growth at\nmultiple levels of the organization?\n\nThe fundamental task of organization design is, as it always has been, helping\na leader move from defining strategy to putting in place an organization that\nenables the strategy to be executed predictably. An effective organization\ndesign model guides a manager in answering five fundamental questions in a\nthoughtful and well-integrated way.\n\n**What is the business\u2019s value proposition and it sources of competitive\nadvantage?  **Business strategies are lofty, typically long-term oriented, and\noften aspirational. By contrast a compelling value proposition describes\nsuccinctly how the company will compete successfully against its\ncompetition\u2014and implies the critical activities around which the organization\nshould be designed. Are you competing on the basis of on-going product or\ntechnological innovation? Through low-cost sourcing and manufacturing?  By\ncreating highly customized solutions for target customers? A clear,\nstraightforward answer to this question provides a foundation on which you can\ndesign an organization.\n\n**Which organizational activities directly deliver on that value\nproposition\u2014and,  by contrast, which activities can the company afford to\nperform in a way equivalent to competition? **When faced with an organization\ndesign challenge, many managers rush to grab a cocktail napkin\u2014long the\ninstrument of choice for reorganizing\u2014and sketch out a high-level diagram of\nboxes and reporting relationships. In doing so, they implicitly accept the way\norganizational resources and costs are currently deployed and miss\nopportunities for more creative, effective design. A better course is devoting\ntime to considering what organizational functions truly bring the value\nproposition to life. As Kreig Smith, founder of design consultancy AlignOrg\nSolutions, [has pointed out](http://alignorg.com/competitive-by-design-how-hr-\ncan-build-a-21st-century-enterprise/), not all work is created equal. Certain\nactivities are crucial to delivering on the value proposition. As a result,\nthey should be owned by the company and given the greatest possible resources.\n\nConversely, there are functions and activities where an extra dollar of\ninvestment doesn\u2019t help the company win in the marketplace. What\u2019s important\nis to realize that both sets of activities vary with a company\u2019s business\nstrategy. For example, new product development may be the lifeblood of a\nconsumer products company\u2014and thus need to be cultivated and resourced\ncarefully\u2014while in a low-cost producer, or fast follower company, product\ndevelopment may be only a nice-to-have activity. \u201cGet the wash out the door\u201d\nactivities, that is, those where being at par with competition is sufficient,\nare candidates for cost reduction whether by centralization, automation,\noutsourcing, or a shared service approach.\n\n**Which organization structure should we choose, and how do we overcome its\ninherent downsides?  **Many leaders fall in love with the organization\nstructure they\u2019re most familiar with, whether it\u2019s organized according to\nfunction, geographic location, customer segment, or through a matrix. In the\nprocess they neglect to appreciate the pros and inherent cons of the structure\nand thus fail to take steps to mitigate the downsides. While a structure\norganized around customer groups is great for getting close to them and\ncatering to their needs, for instance, it can be costly, and over time\ninterest in product innovation may wane. What\u2019s more, organization structures\nby definition create boundaries between one part of the organization and\nothers. A successful organization design therefore, as Jay Galbraith of the\nCenter for Effective Organizations pointed out years ago, includes linking or\nintegrating mechanisms, such as an account management function to coordinate\nactivities\u2014creative, design, brand management, and so forth\u2014on behalf of the\nclient within an advertising agency.\n\n**What type of leadership and culture are required to achieve the value\nproposition?** For all the table pounding that managers do about culture\nchange, few fully consider the type of leadership and culture required to put\na new organization design into gear. Clearly, a low-cost producer strategy\ndemands a ruthless focus on controlling costs while a customer-focused\norganization needs to encourage deep customer knowledge and internal\ncoordination aimed at creating customer-specific products and services. When a\ncompany adopts a significantly different organization design, a critical part\nof the implementation process needs to include putting in place leaders who\nlead in a way consistent with the new value proposition and who will take\nsteps to strengthen corresponding cultural norms. For example, when a company\nmoves from an efficiency-based strategy to a customer-focused one, members of\nthe leadership team need to introduce a new reward system to promote a do-\nwhatever-it-takes mentality in responding to customer needs throughout the\norganization.\n\n**Which organizational practices are required to reinforce the organizational\nintent?** Many managers introduce a new strategy and organization structure\nand declare victory\u2014often at their peril. The reason that cultures are so\ndifficult to change is that cultural values are deeply woven into the policies\nand practices that govern how people work. As a result, when leaders launch a\nsignificantly new organization design, it\u2019s imperative that they revise such\npractices \u2014 how performance objectives are set, the metrics and scorecards\nthat signal success or failure, the type of people to be recruited, and how\nthey are trained. Otherwise, they\u2019ll put in place a shiny new organization\nstructure \u2014 but find that people are behaving exactly as they did under the\nold regime.\n\nAs organization structures have become more fluid and organic, organization\ndesign is no longer the purview of a handful of senior executives supported by\nhigh-priced consultants. Leaders at many levels of the organization are\nincreasingly called on to reallocate organizational resources and redesign\ntheir organizations to support more frequent shifts in company strategy. As a\nresult, they need to have a trusty organization design model in their\nwallets\u2014and know how to use it.\n\n* * *\n\n[John Beeson](/search?term=john%20beeson&search_type=search-all) is Principal\nof [Beeson Consulting](http://beesonconsultinginc.com/), a management\nconsulting firm specializing in succession planning, executive assessment and\ncoaching, and organization design.

And there was no mention of [staff playing with\nLego](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anz-breaks-out-lego-to-bust-staff-\nsilos-512397).\n\n**Cultural challenges**\n\nANZ recently revealed it's faced some substantial challenges getting the NWOW\ncultural fit right, including making many people in the 9000 strong push [re-\napply for their jobs using video\ninterviews](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anz-reveals-the-good-and-bad-of-\nits-agile-transformation-523277).\n\nWhile the bank has cited some [conspicuous productivity\nimprovements](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anz-removes-gatekeepers-that-\nslowed-its-code-516728) of being able to do the same amount of work with up to\n30 percent less staff, Elliott made it plain there are operational limits into\nhow far and fast enterprise agile programs like NWOW can travel.\n\n\"I don't have a target, I don't really care what the number is, if it works we\nwant more of it,\" Elliott expounded... before listing where new ways of\nworking, well, doesn't really work.\n\n\"It doesn't work in some areas. It won't work in contact centres, it won't\nwork in branches, it won't work in a dealing room,\" Elliott said before\npouring some very cold water on the overuse of the great agile managerialist\nmeme.\n\n\"It's not about agile, that's why we called it New Ways of Working,\" he\ncontested.\n\n\"It's about the best way of working for you that delivers speed, productivity\nand the best outcomes for customers.\n\n\"Not [making] you work in a way that we impose on you because it looks good on\nan org chart. We don't have a target, but are going to continue to transform,\"\nthe ANZ chief stressed.\n\nBut there are still some agility targets, albeit without big numbers.\nIronically, this includes what used to be known as the [human resources\ndivision](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anz-puts-boot-into-hr-for-digital-\nhiring-failures-515923).\n\n\"Our talent and culture team is moving that way, they are about 600 people,\"\nElliott said.\n\n**Headcount shrink in war on costs**\n\nAgile or not, ANZ's rock solid number was conspicuously helped along by what's\nnow a 5 percent headcount reduction over the past 12 months, de-staffing that\nhappened concurrently  the NWOW program alongside with a spate of divestments\naimed at streamlining operations.\n\nTechnology-led cost cutting - [automation, robotics, process optimisation and\nservice digitisation](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anz-gets-its-automation-\nfactory-humming-518371) - helped jettison plenty of people over the past year\nas the institution prepares for lean post-Royal Commission times.\n\nThe numbers on ANZ's total FTE (full time equivalent) headcount fell from\n39,655 people to 37,364 according to its divisional staff movement numbers, a\nfall of 2291. The same chart shows ANZ has dispensed with the services of a\nwhopping 9,470 staff since March 2016 when headcount stood at 46,834.\n\n![](https://i.nextmedia.com.au/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https%3a%2f%2fi.nextmedia.com.au%2fNews%2fANZ_H1_2019_headcount.JPG&w=550&c=0)\n\nThe good news for technologists is that Elliott and ANZ forsee tech staff\nmaking-up a bigger proportion of the shrunken headcount.\n\nExplaining ANZ's technology cost base, Elliott stressed to analysts that when\nhe said technology \"it's not just boxes and wires its people.\"\n\n\"The proportion of people in tech will go up,\" Elliott said.\n\n\"In terms of boxes and wires we have to get value from that.\"\n\n**Tech spend also firmly down**\n\nBetter '[box and wire' value is being doggedly\npursued](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anz-slashes-mainframe-bill-with-cpu-\nmonitoring-513390). Notably, technology expenses including amortisation also\ndropped $69 million for the reporting period as did [ANZ's software\ncapitalisation](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anz-reveals-15bn-software-\npurge-514845) which shed 4 percent to $1.4 billion.\n\nThis came despite the bank saying it has shifted \"2 million customers to\ncontemporary platforms.\"\n\nCapitalised software was also called out as a sectoral best which the investor\nslides said \"continues to be lowest of domestic peers.\"\n\n\"The tough retail banking environment will be a reality for the foreseeable\nfuture. We knew three years ago there would be strong headwinds and have taken\naction to respond head-on, including restructuring our Australian business,\"\nElliott said.\n\nElliott added that it was not just ANZ's high profile digital banking chief\n[Maile Carnegie](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anz-digital-chief-maile-\ncarnegie-frets-over-human-obsolescence-512571) or CIO [Gerard\nFlorian](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anzs-cio-says-his-cloud-focus-is-on-\nflex-not-price-amid-sectoral-uncertainty-518861) pushing the mass\nmodernisation agenda, it was a group-wide effort.\n\n\"With Maile's input and Gerard's it's not a tech transformation it's a\nbusiness transformation,\" Elliott said.\n\n\"We are rethinking the whole business\".\n\nThere are external fans of that rethink, especially on the institutional side.\nANZ recently revealed its recent deal with the NSW government to be [a second\ntransactional bank](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anz-bank-reveals-its-big-\nconsumer-data-push-to-nsw-govt-523606) alongside incumbent Westpac will see it\n[tap into customer data](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anz-wants-to-use-real-\ncustomer-data-to-test-new-software-515250).  \n\n**$8 billion bank ops target**\n\nWhere ANZ and its [perpetual state of transformation, now led by Maile\nCarnegie, ](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/maile-carnegie-handed-keys-to-anzs-\ntotal-transformation-in-promotion-519944)is headed in the near to medium term\ncould be described as an operational paleo diet.\n\nAnnual operating costs - what it costs to run the bank per year - are slated\nto fall $8 billion a year, an ambitious number Elliott said would require cost\nreductions and efficiencies of around $1 billion over the next next years.\n\nSome of this would come from the simplification and [digitisation of\nproducts](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anz-cleans-up-its-data-for-\nreuse-519522), especially now that ANZ could better control how it spent\nannual investment of around $1 billion a year so it doesn't get sunk into\nmaintaining underperforming service lines or products and costly legacy.\n\n\"We have to retool for a data and digital world,\" Elliott said, adding that\nwith simplification \"we get to choose not spray\" across non-performing\nbusinesses.\n\nTo that end ANZ claims it has \"maintained digital wallet leadership with more\nthan 88 million transactions in the last 12 months, with total customer spend\nup 114 percent\" in that same period.\n\nThose transactions are being watched closely, especially by ANZ's residential\nlending department where they're super keen on spending data, even if they\noccasionally bite off more of it than they can physically swallow.\n\n**Messy mortgages**\n\nNot all of the operational retooling, especially when prudential and [risk\nsettings](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/anz-says-the-motor-oil-you-pick-\ncould-swing-your-mortgage-512025) come into play has gone smoothly, Elliott\nconceded, especially in home lending were ANZ ceded market share.\n\nTightening lending criteria - partially in response to responsible lending\npressure and central bank fears of a bubble - substantially upped the volume\nof documentation applicants needed to provide to the bank. Neither digital nor\ntraditional channels made a good fist of it.\n\nElliott said ANZ now asked applicants \"a helluva lot more questions\" while\ndrilling into their expenses and asking for better income documentation, like\nmore payslips.\n\n \"It's quite clunky, we didn't do it in a smooth way,\" Elliott said. \"It got\nout to 20 days, we were struggling.\"\n\nComparing mortgage applications to a finely tuned production line that\npreviously rejected single digit percentages of applications Elliott said\n\"suddenly 20 percent was going down the reject line\" - before swiftly\nstressing that the 20 percent number was actually an illustrative number he'd\njust made up on the spot to illustrate, not a real one.\n\n\"We're putting more loan assessors on,\" Elliott said, adding it had been too\nhard to get a loan with ANZ, it took too long, and the bank had just asked\n\"for too much stuff\".\n\nThe head of ANZ's retail bank, Mark Hand, concurred.\n\n\"The new arms race is the speed to assessment: automation, getting the\ndocumentation together,\" Hand said of current lending market conditions,\" Hand\nsaid.\n\n\"This is not the time for waiting and hoping,\" Elliott said.\n\nAgile or post-agile, new ways of working or old fashioned human grunt, ANZ is\non the transformation journey for real now.\n\nGot a news tip for our journalists?

This is fantasy.\u2019 Photograph: Stephen\nBrashear/Getty Images\n\nImagine working for a company with no bosses. On your first day, you are given\na handbook for new employees. This will be \u201cthe greatest professional\nexperience of your life\u201d, you read. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any management, and nobody\nreports to anybody else.\u201d You can decide which projects you work on. If you\nhate who you\u2019re sitting next to you can simply move \u2013 there are wheels on the\nbottom of your desk to help. The company has some exciting quirks like a\nmassage room, an in-house radical economist, and trips where everyone in the\nwhole company goes on holiday together.\n\n> The industries with the least in the way of formal rules and regulations are\n> often rife with sexual harassment\n\nThis is no fantasy. It\u2019s a computer game development company called\n[Valve](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/technology/valve-a-video-game-\nmaker-with-few-rules.html). Based in a suburb of Seattle, Valve has produced\nwell-known games such as [Half-\nLife](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/aug/14/half-\nlife-3-game-exist-valve), and a hugely successful digital distribution\nplatform called\n[Steam](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/17/steam-controller-\nvalve-gaming). It has recently started developing hardware for games\ndevelopers.\n\nIn 2012 Valve\u2019s new employee handbook was leaked. Fawning articles about this\nunique and amazing company appear everywhere from the\n[BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24205497) to [Harvard Business\nReview](https://hbr.org/2013/11/hierarchy-is-overrated). Valve\u2019s economist in\nresidence \u2013[ Yanis\nVaroufakis](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/feb/18/yanis-varoufakis-how-\ni-became-an-erratic-marxist), the former Greek finance minister \u2013 appeared on\na [podcast](http://www.econtalk.org/varoufakis-on-valve-spontaneous-order-and-\nthe-european-crisis/) describing the company\u2019s unique system of rewarding\nemployees.\n\nSince then, the glittering aura of Valve\u2019s \u201cno boss\u201d culture has started to\nfade. In 2013, an ex-employee described how the company had \u201ca pseudo-flat\nstructure\u201d. \u201cThere is actually a hidden layer of powerful management structure\nin the company,\u201d [she said](https://www.wired.com/2013/07/wireduk-valve-jeri-\nellsworth/), which made it feel \u201ca lot like high school\u201d.\n\nNow, five years later, another ex-employee has taken to Twitter to share his\nthoughts about a nameless company that [closely resembles\nValve](https://www.pcgamer.com/ex-valve-employee-describes-ruthless-industry-\npolitics/). Rich Geldreich described how the firm would hire employees, make\nthem grand promises, then fire them once they were no longer useful. He\ndescribed the firm as being run by \u201cbarons\u201d \u2013 and advises new employees to\ncosy up to a baron in order to \u201crapidly up your purge immunity level before\nthe next firing cycle\u201d.\n\nGeldreich\u2019s description squares with some reviews of Valve on Glassdoor, a\nsite where staff leave anonymous verdicts on their employers (although it has\nto be said that many employees like Valve\u2019s culture). One describes the no-\nboss culture as \u201conly a facade\u201d: \u201cTo succeed at Valve you need to belong to\nthe group that has more decisional power and, even when you succeed\ntemporarily, be certain that you have an expiration date. No matter how hard\nyou work, no matter how original and productive you are, if your bosses and\nthe people who count don\u2019t like you, you will be fired soon or you will be\nmanaged out.\u201d\n\nGeldreich describes a neo-feudal workplace culture of powerful barons who\nruthlessly exercise their whims over temporary favourites, then turn on them\nduring the next \u201chead count reduction\u201d exercise.\n\nSuch endemic uncertainty is not unique to the computer games industry. Jeffrey\nPfeffer, of Stanford University, points out that many young employees in the\ntech industry think there is no hierarchy, their boss is their buddy, and\n[work is fun](https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/amp.2013.0040). This is\nfantasy, Pfeffer says. The lack of formal rules and hierarchy masks a vicious\ninformal power structure. But unlike good old-fashioned hierarchies, there are\nfew checks and balances in place in flat firms. Powerful \u201cbarons\u201d can pursue\ntheir caprices with few limitations.\n\nThe industries with the least in the way of formal rules and regulations are\noften rife with sexual harassment. In a forthcoming book, Peter Fleming, a\nbusiness school professor, points out that the wave of scandals triggered by\nrevelations about [Harvey\nWeinstein](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/13/harvey-weinstein-\nlawyer-denies-report-that-producer-offered-acting-jobs-for-sex)\u2019s alleged\npredation is in no small part connected to the highly flexible organisational\nstructures that [Hollywood runs\non](http://politybooks.com/bookdetail/?isbn=9781509528196).\n\n## We went too far in toppling authority. Some is good for us | Eliane Glaser\n\nRead more\n\n[](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/09/toppling-authority-\npopulism)\n\nLike firms, the famously bureaucratic public sector has also fallen for\nflatness. In place of rules, regulation and evidence, many public agencies\nhave started to look for \u201cpassion\u201d, \u201centhusiasm\u201d and \u201cflexibility\u201d. It might\nsound great, but the academic and author [Paul du\nGay](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4194898?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) warns\nthat it can lead to dangerous and even disastrous results. For instance, the\nmilitary misadventures of the early 21st century were often due to the passion\nand enthusiasm of elected officials trumping the formal rules and expertise\noffered by civil servants and military personnel.\n\nGetting rid of formal hierarchies has also proved dangerous in social\nmovements. After spending years in the women\u2019s liberation movement of the\n1960s, the American political scientist Jo Freeman warned of the [\u201ctyranny of\nstructurelessness\u201d](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41035187?casa_token=R2RHZIRkBuIAAAAA:-Z08MjhnXEhEH0oKVDsatZdU9-20Dhttxh-\nVvSKSZd6ceKr8shtHfiALyrs_iDVlBqhUEOmdT28wscOhda4cMh8nKBKxJevf3atgrOda2IQxexBb&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).\nAlthough egalitarian and democratic structures have many benefits, [she\npointed out](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/09/toppling-\nauthority-populism), structurelessness easily \u201cbecomes a smokescreen for the\nstrong or the lucky to establish unquestioned hegemony over others\u201d. By\nputting rules and structures in place, you make it clear and transparent how\nthe group or organisation works. The lesson Freeman learned in the early 1970s\nhas been forgotten over and over again.\n\nFantasies of no rules, no bosses and no hierarchies are seductive. Hierarchies\ncan be repressive, rules can be absurd, and bosses can be toxic. But not\nhaving these things can be worse.\n\n\u2022 Andr\u00e9 Spicer, a professor at the Cass Business School in London, is the\nauthor of Business Bullshit\n\nTopics\n\n  * [ Management

The\ncompany said that companies must navigate an increasingly diverse range of\nplatforms and channels given the unprecedented exponential growth of the\ndigital ecosystem.\n\n\"Marketing campaigns are increasingly sophisticated, weaving online and\noffline narratives and experiences borne from strategic CRM design-led\napproaches. It is paramount that resulting data threads are captured cleanly\nand analysed intelligently to ensure ad investment bears fruit,\" said Siti\nRaflise, Chief Data Officer at Consider iProspect.\n\nRecognising that every client presents a unique data capture blueprint, the\ncompany designed Pronto to flex organically to fit every user's need.\n\nWe saw that other competitor business intelligence tools in the market offered\nlimited customisation with pre-set data capture parameters. Pronto allows each\nchart to have its own set of filters and may have its own set of data sources.\nWe utilise our core expertise in understanding digital data formats and how to\nmerge offline marketing data in order to provide a full picture of end to end\nmarketing activities to the CMO,\" said Siti Raflise.\n\nAmongst the list of Consider iProspect's satisfied clients was a global\npharmaceutical company who had a marketing plan and an omnichannel digital\npresence but didn't have any method to link those efforts to sales, leaving\nstrategic and budgeting decisions in silos.\n\nThe company said Pronto displays offline and online marketing data for this\nclient, with 24 traditional and digital KPIs at a highly granular level,\nacross nine data sources together with real-time lead generation outcomes.\n\nThe data sources and platforms used include Facebook, Digimind, Google Ads,\nGoogle Cloud, DoubleClick Bid Manager, SEO Monitor and programmatic platforms,\ngiving the client complete visibility on the share of voice of their brands\nacross various market segments.\n\nThis allowed the client to view and analyse the performance of each channel\nand adapt the appropriate strategy to optimise campaigns. Pronto also enabled\nthe client to view the telesales conversion data at a granular level,\nproviding an insight into cross-sales, conversion rates by channel and lead\nquality. By measuring the KPIs against the targets, Pronto facilitates the\norganisation's future marketing and lead conversion strategies.\n\nIn addition to specific business metrics, the digital marketing intelligence\ntool impacts business functions such as staff productivity, marketing budget\nallocation, marketing planning, sales planning and 360\u00b0 strategic traditional\nand digital marketing execution.\n\nPronto was developed using open-source technology which means that it can\nadapt and evolve in response to advancements and business changes in areas\nlike big data, AI, machine learning, digital transformation, social commerce\nand omnichannel.\n\nSiti also said that the main reason for developing Pronto is because there was\nno other tool out there in the market that can display every single marketing\nKPI from every channel.\n\n\"Pronto is the one and only tool in the market in Asia that has this\ncapability. Where it is also customisable to the client's needs. Every company\nhas multiple strategies for each product and multiple strategies for their\nsales and marketing channels. There is no one place where all these KPIs come\ntogether and that's why Pronto is unique,\" she added.\n\n_The Malaysia Technology Excellence Awards, presented by Singapore Business\nReview, was held on 3 December 2019 at Shangri-La Hotel, Kuala Lumpur._\n\n_This year 's nominations were judged by a panel consisting of Alvin SH Gan,\nExecutive Director, Partner, and Head of IT Enabled Transformation (ITeT) at\nKPMG Malaysia; Yoon Hoong Hoh, Partner, ASEAN Digital Assurance Leader, and\nHead of Diversified, Technology and Communications Group at Ernst & Young;\nJustin Ong, Partner and FSI Financial and Regulatory Risk Leader at Deloitte\nAsia Pacific; Hari Iyerm, Executive Director of Advisory at BDO Kuala Lumpur._\n\n_If you would like to join the 2020 awards and be acclaimed for your company\n's exceptional technology innovations, please email\njulie@charltonmediamail.com_  \n\n\nDo you know more about this story?
