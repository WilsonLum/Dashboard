Job\ngrowth is feeling the pain too, with a growing number of American companies\nclamping down on their hiring, budgets, and growth plans overall. [Moody's\nAnalytics estimates](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/16/economy/job-losses-\ncoronavirus/index.html) nearly 80 million jobs in the U.S. economy are at high\nor moderate risk right now.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nNot every company can afford to completely halt their hiring plans, as certain\nroles may be essential to sustaining and growing the business amidst these\nuncertain times. And for some industries, hiring is absolutely essential right\nnow. Amazon, for example, [plans to hire an additional\n100,000](https://www.fastcompany.com/90478317/how-do-you-practice-social-\ndistancing-in-an-amazon-warehouse) warehouse and delivery workers to keep up\nwith the surge in online orders amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nFor Amazon and others, [virtual\nrecruiting](https://www.doodle.com/en/solutions/recruiting/) will be a new way\nforward.\n\nOnboarding is different because it's the first official impression of a\ncompany and typically conducted over a series of face-to-face meetings. This\ncan include one-to-one meetings with HR, direct managers, and members of the\nleadership team, as well as group meetings with various teams in the\norganization. This begs the question: Is HR prepared to pivot and adopt\nvirtual onboarding for globally distributed and remote teams?\n\nIf you're continuing with hiring plans right now and will be heavily reliant\non technology for the onboarding process, here are some key steps to take to\ndevelop and implement a successful virtual onboarding process.\n\n## Streamline the number of activities\n\n[According to Sapling](https://www.saplinghr.com/10-employee-onboarding-\nstatistics-you-must-know-in-2020), the average new hire has 54 activities to\ncomplete during their onboarding experience. The sheer number of activities\ncould slow down an employee's ramp-up period, which could make it tough for\nthem to learn necessary skills and tasks related to their jobs. Remember, if\nan onboarding program hampers the employee's ability to perform their job, it\nwill likely cause stress, anxiety, and self-doubt. That's a surefire recipe\nfor early turnover.\n\nWhile information sharing and engagement are certainly important, it's\nimportant to balance it against the employee's personal motivations, learning\nbehaviors, and professional development goals. Be realistic and streamline the\nnumber of activities so that the onboarding process puts them on the path to\nlong-term satisfaction and engagement. Use online tools, including scheduling\nsoftware, internal communications platforms, and videoconferencing tools to\nmake sure the important onboarding meetings happen virtually. But more\nimportantly, keep the meetings as focused, engaged, and productive as\npossible.\n\nadvertisement\n\n## Educate managers on the importance of one-to-one time with direct reports\n\nStudies have found that up to 20% of all [new hires actually\nresign](https://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2013/07/19/how-not-to-lose-your-\nnew-employees-in-their-first-45-days/#1fd76a163be3) within the first 45 days\nof their role. And when the onboarding process is conducted virtually, it's\neven more critical to get the experience right.\n\nOne way to do this is to educate managers on the importance of carving out\ntime for [one-to-one\nmeetings](https://doodle.com/content/doodle-1on1-meetings) with their direct\nreports. It could make a huge difference in the success of onboarding\nprograms. In fact, 72% of employees [surveyed by\nEnboarder](https://enboarder.com/2018/11/01/employee-onboarding-new-hire-\nretention-turnover-rates/) said one-on-one time with their direct manager is\nthe most important aspect of any pre-boarding or onboarding process.\n\nUnfortunately, this often gets overlooked because HR assumes that\nmanagers/leaders already know this. But leadership is an iterative process. HR\nneeds to involve and educate team managers and the broader leadership team\ninto the essential components of successful onboarding. Education and\nknowledge sharing needs to flow openly and effectively between both sides.\n\nIt doesn't even matter that these one-to-one meetings now have to occur\nvirtually. [Eighty percent of business\nprofessionals](https://blog.tmcnet.com/blog/rich-tehrani/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/2019-Impact-of-Video-Conferencing-Report-\nLifesize_FINAL.pdf) already rely on video for one-to-one meetings. Plus, 78%\nrely on video for team meetings/standups. The key is to use the right\ntechnology solutions to automate and optimize the process so one-to-one\nmeetings can be set up quickly, the right people can participate, the right\nknowledge is shared, and necessary action items come out as a result.\n\n## Lean into digital tools to forge shared communities (and engagement)\n\nWhen employees are physically distanced from their team members, direct\nmanagers, colleagues, and leadership, it can be easy to isolate and disengage\nwith others. This is especially true for newly hired employees who haven't had\nthe chance to experience the company's culture.\n\nBut this is where digital tools and social networks carry tremendous power in\ntheir abilities to bring communities of globally dispersed and remote\nemployees together.\n\nadvertisement\n\nI'm seeing it firsthand in our own company right now. We've created multiple\nnew channels in our dedicated internal communications platform (Slack) to\nengage our globally dispersed workforce. The purpose of these channels has\nvery little to do with providing corporate-approved messages. But yes, we're\nalso being responsible for our corporate communications.\n\nWhat's equally important is that our employees can break through the confines\nof isolation to forge a shared community that's all about embracing their true\nselves and helping each other out (regardless of teams, roles, and seniority\nlevels). Currently, team members are engaged in a fun competition to guess who\nmatches the baby photos being posted by an employee (the designated collector\nof baby photos). I've also personally invited every single employee in our\ncompany for a 15-minute virtual coffee meeting with me (twice daily to cover\nall time zones) over the next few weeks.\n\nThese examples are further proof that companies should lean into the socially\ncollaborative nature of digital tools at a time when employee engagement and\nretention could dip significantly. Digital can be vital to the success of\nonboarding programs for fully remote workers.\n\n* * *\n\n _Renato Profico is the CEO

post-scandal, coronavirus world.\n\nBy: [Carol Patton](https://hrexecutive.com/author/carol-patton/ \"Posts by\nCarol Patton\") | April 6, 2020 \u2022 2 min read\n\nTopics:

company\u2019s new CHRO. It\u2019s great pay, a great job and great growth\nopportunity. There\u2019s just one catch: Your predecessor abruptly quit due to a\nhighly publicized scandal. Consider stepping into David Fairhurst\u2019s job, the\nformer chief people officer at McDonald\u2019s, [who stepped down last\nfall](https://hrexecutive.com/heres-why-mcdonalds-turmoil-may-also-be-an-\nopportunity/) after his boss, the CEO, was fired for having a consensual\naffair with a colleague.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow should you hold the reins? What are your top priorities, especially during\na pandemic? How do you establish trust and build confidence among the\nworkforce as an HR leader? Start the process by demonstrating to workers a\nreal understanding of what they may be thinking, feeling or experiencing, says\nDavid Rock, co-founder and CEO of the NeuroLeadership Institute, a global\ninitiative that is building a new science for leadership development. Then,\nRock says, share your personal values and leadership style to help them rally\ntogether and offset the inherent sense of danger they may be feeling.\n\n**[Read all of _HRE_ \u2018s coronavirus coverage\nhere.](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/\n\"https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/\")**\n\n\u201cThe biggest factor is empathy, labeling what people are probably experiencing\nand normalizing it,\u201d Rock says. \u201cIf people feel their leader in a crisis only\ncares about money and doesn\u2019t show care for [them], they will head for the\ndoor as soon as they can.\u201d\n\nWithin your first 100 days, identify and share tangible goals that employees\nare likely to support and can jointly accomplish. For example, employees could\nbe involved in a project that provides food to coworkers in need. Rock says\nthe most powerful goals benefit local communities or society as a whole,\ngenerate warmth and motivate employees to unite behind them.\n\nLikewise, start building competence \u201cone expectation at a time,\u201d says Rock,\nadding that HR tasks must be prioritized. \u201cWhat really matters? Be really\nexplicit about things you\u2019re going to do so you can clearly show you\u2019re making\nprogress. In the environment we\u2019re in, it\u2019s critical to focus on what\u2019s\nessential and not try to be exhaustive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOftentimes, Rock says, new CHROs don\u2019t communicate enough, work quietly in the\nbackground and hope employees recognize and appreciate their skills, which\nrarely happens, he says. Instead, deliver clear communications\u2014at least once a\nweek\u2014about your values and vision and, given our current situation, offer\nupdates on major issues like coronavirus. Forget about reaching quarterly\ngoals during the pandemic. Reset your expectations and focus on daily or\nweekly targets, which will be more realistic to achieve.\n\n\u201cRight now, HR leaders must also take care of themselves, look after their\npeople and deliver essentials,\u201d he says. \u201cThe coronavirus isn\u2019t a sprint, it\u2019s\na marathon. We need different work habits right now.\u201d\n\nCarol Patton is a contributing editor for _HRE_ who also writes HR articles\nand columns for business and education magazines.

PrimeAxess health plans include a health savings account\n(HSA) program that will assist in the funding of the employee HSA. The Company\nis estimating that its programs will add nearly 1,400 of Infiniti\u2019s co-\nemployees by May 2020 and an additional 3,000-4,000 co-employees by July 2020.\nThe Company started sales in November 2019 and has added more employee lives\neach month. The Company presently has approximately 250 members. Each member\n(families count as one member) generates approximately an average of\n$1,000/month of revenue and $200/month of operating profit. Given the\nprojected onboarding numbers, the Company estimates it will generate $5\nmillion/month or $60 million/year of revenue starting in July 2020. This will\ngenerate approximately $1 million/month and $12 million/year of operating\nearnings starting in July. Mr. Pat Dileo, the Company CEO, stated, \u201cOur JV\nwith Infiniti HR that started in late 2019 and preceded the current national\nhealth and economic crisis and today we believe our member on-boarding will\nexceed previous projections as we have telehealth, telemedicine, and tele\nmental health built into our plan designs and ready to go. In the second half\nof 2020 our cash flow should be sufficient to remove all existing convertible\ndebt in the Company if we choose an internally fund our growth. The JV with\nInfiniti HR means the coming estimated 40% premium cost increases by the fully\ninsured health plan carriers will be negated for those Infiniti HR employee\nclients switching to PrimeAxess plans. The JV\u2019s excess cash flow when all the\nemployees are onboarded is estimated at $60+ million/month or $720\nmillion/year of revenue and correspondingly $12 million/month or nearly $144\nmillion/year of operating earnings. This projection estimate is with only our\none PEO contract with Infiniti HR. The JV plans to bring our solutions to many\nother PEO companies. The Infiniti HR contract is in process, and our best\nestimates could accelerate or decelerate by a month or so due to the Covid 19\nunknowns.\u201d\n\nInformation on Forward Looking Statements  \nThe statements contained herein that are not historical facts are forward-\nlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws (Section\n27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934).

There is a vast set of\ndigital tools, from video conferencing platforms to collaboration software to\nhelp make the transition possible.\n\n### More for CXOs\n\n  * [What is the CIO's role in cybersecurity leadership?](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/what-is-the-cios-role-in-cybersecurity-leadership/)\n  * [6 questions the C-suite must answer to achieve digital transformation](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/6-questions-the-c-suite-must-answer-to-achieve-digital-transformation/)\n  * [Vendor contract renewal planner (TechRepublic Premium)](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/toolkit-vendor-contract-renewal-planner/)\n  * [How to manage IT during mergers and acquisitions (free PDF)](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/how-to-manage-it-during-mergers-and-acquisitions/)\n\nBut while it may be one thing to transition current employees from the\nphysical to digital office, companies must turn attention to another hurdle:\nHow to train new employees for the remote office during\n[COVID-19](https://www.cbsnews.com/coronavirus/).\n\n**SEE** :  [Coronavirus: Critical IT policies and tools every business\nneeds](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/coronavirus-critical-it-policies-\nand-tools-every-business-needs/) ( **TechRepublic Premium** )\n\nThe enterprise is in need of fresh and innovative ways to train and onboard\nnew employees as they begin work online. Here are four ways it can be done,\naccording to the experts:\n\n##  **1\\. Get your processes in order**\n\nBefore you get any new employees on board, it's important to make sure your\nprocesses are organized. Making sure the documentation of everything is up-to-\ndate is critical, and even more so when you're onboarding with remote workers.\n\n\"Even with chat tools like Slack, there is less ability to ask the person next\nto you where something is or how something is done at your organization,\" said\nWally Nowinski, head of marketing at Collage, a work-from-home company.\n\n\"The way you solve this is by ensuring all of your internal processes and\nprojects are well documented, and make keeping that documentation up to date a\nregular part of your work process,\" he added.\n\nAdditionally, having employee equipment, software, and email accounts\ndelivered and set up ahead of time is key.\n\n##  **2\\. Make face-to-virtual-face introductions**\n\nBecause work-from-home means employees will be shuffling over to their home\ncoffee maker\u2014perhaps in pajamas\u2014instead of gathering at the office break room,\nit's important to ensure that they meet other colleagues, as this won't be\nhappening organically.\n\n\"You can solve this by scheduling getting-to-know-you calls for every new hire\nwith key people in the organization they are not working with directly,\" said\nNowinski. \"This helps put a human connection behind the names people see in\nSlack and emails.\"\n\n##  3\\. **Encourage digital engagement**\n\nWorking remotely can be an isolating experience\u2014especially when you don't\nalready know your colleagues. According to Renato Profico, CEO of Doodle, it's\ncritical to ensure that digital onboarding is engaging.\n\n\"When employees are physically distanced from their team members and managers,\nit can be easy for them to isolate themselves and disengage with others,\" he\nsaid. \"This is especially true for new hires who haven't had the chance to\nexperience the company's culture quite yet.\"\n\nProfico recommends that employees are offered digital tools to help make the\ntransition smoother, such as creating separate Slack channels. He also\nsuggests keeping activities and meetings \"as focused and engaging as possible\"\nin order to reduce the stress of the process.\n\n##  4\\. **Integrate new tech like AR**\n\nIt's time to think outside the box, and leveraging new tools like augmented\nreality (AR) for training and onboarding can help employers scale the process\nacross various locations. AR can be used to update manuals and tutorials and\nupload new content, which can also save time and money, said Emil Alon, CEO\nand founder of Resonai **.**  \n  \nAdditionally, the experiences using AR may prove more engaging for new\nemployees, he stresses, which can improve the way they pick up new and\ncomplicated material.  \n  \n\"I would advise HR departments to start looking into how they can implement\nnew technology\u2014AR included\u2014to help recreate their company culture from\ndifferent locations,\" Alon said. \"There's no time table to when this is going\nto end, so it's better to get ahead of the curve now and stabilize your\ninfrastructure.\"\n\n![](https://tr4.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/techrepubliccss/images/article-\nNLSthumb.jpg)\n\n### Best of the Week

The company could make recruitment decisions, writes Paul\nOsborne is Chief Technology Officer of Cerdonis Technologies LLC.**_\n\nModern enterprises are increasingly opting for new technologies for enhanced\nefficiency. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) have now grown\npopular for employee training, recruitment, and several other HR processes.\nYes, those old days of finding resumes as the only concrete document for\nemployee evaluation has gone with the wind of change. Now, a host of new\ntechnologies, including VR and AR, are making this possible most innovatively.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nRecently, Lloyds Banking Group incorporated virtual reality for the assessment\nprocess of the Graduate Leadership Programme candidates. This VR program is\nasking the recruits to solve a puzzle in a simulated environment, and based on\nthe results showcasing the strengths and abilities of the recruits, and the\ncompany could make recruitment decisions.\n\nLet us explain here some of the time-tested ways VR and AR-based simulation\ncan help in the modern recruitment process.\n\n## **Helping Future Recruits to Experience the Workplace Remotely**\n\nThere are other ways VR and AR can make the recruitment process easier. For\nexample, during recruitment, employees spend considerable time in the\ncompany's workplace for evaluating the work environment and its respective\npros and cons. Now, a VR based simulated environment of a workplace can help\nemployees give a better idea about the working environment they are going to\nbe part of.\n\nMost importantly, this can give employees relief from the compulsion of\nvisiting the company's workplace personally. While sitting miles away, they\ncan get an air of the working environment right through their mobile device\nscreen.\n\nThe recruitment process of Jet.com is a nice example of this practice. By\noffering VR based immersive presentations, the company is helping the recruits\nto get a clear idea of the workplace they are going to be a part of. The\nWalmart online shopping platform is also utilizing VR experience to showcase\nthe working environment and experience of their workplace.\n\n## **Making Use of Gamification for Job Applications**\n\nRecruitment is a competitive field since it allows a company to pull the best\ntalents from the market and get a competitive edge. Since every company is\nworking hard to get the best of the limited pool of talents in the job market,\nusing new and innovative ways to get in touch with the right employees is\nessential.\n\nIn this respect, the use of gamification can be a good way to replace the old\napplication processes with something efficient, new, and innovative. This will\nalso help boost the interactivity of the recruitment process to a great\nextent. Instead of allowing the recruits to fill up a long-form with all the\ndetails such as educational qualification, experience, completed projects,\netc., a gamified process can reveal this information through an interactive\nprocess.\n\nThis gamified process can particularly be useful for recruitment screening.\nActiView is an Israeli startup that made use of VR technology to detect\nvarious behavioral habits and attributes that are required for evaluating the\nemployees and their personalities.\n\n**Learn More:[How Augmented Reality Helps to Upskill\nEmployees](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/how-\naugmented-reality-helps-to-upskill-employees/)**\n\n## **Providing Technical Training to Employees**\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) can help in orienting the employees with various\ntechnical details related to their job roles. VR can also help in providing an\nimmersive environment for new employee induction and training, which is very\nmuch a part of the recruitment process. Thanks to the use of VR, recruits can\nbe better oriented with their job tasks and get engaged with their job roles\nfaster.\n\nMoreover, thanks to the immersive environment created with VR, an employee can\nget hands-on training on complex machines and technical parts right within a\ntraining room. VR will be able to flee the boundaries between reality and the\nvirtual environment and help faster learning and engagement.\n\n## **Providing Safety Training**\n\nIn many industries and enterprise environments, employee safety is a constant\nmatter of concern. In industries where safety concerns are too many, virtual\nreality can play an important role in safety training procedures. In many\nindustries where employees need to take commendable risks for operating\nmachines, handling equipment, and raw materials, VR based safety training\nprocedures can train them better with procedures to ensure personal safety and\nwell-being.\n\nThis is particularly true for dealing with the safety concerns of the\nproduction plants and facilities involving heavy machinery, chemicals, and\nlife-threatening procedures and processes. For example, in the firefighting\nindustry, the VR based training on new challenges corresponding to fire\nbreakout incidents can be hugely beneficial to curb accidental cases.\n\n**Learn More:[AR Meets HR: How Augmented Reality Can Strengthen Learning &\nDevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/ar-\nmeets-hr-how-augmented-reality-can-strengthen-learning-development/)**\n\nSafety training simulations based on VR may also need using different\nprotective equipment, including safety helmets, hooks, goggles, etc. VR based\nsimulated safety training can give employees a better idea about using this\nequipment and tools. Such VR based simulation can also guide the employees\nabout making movement in different areas, using safety tools in a variety of\ncontexts and operating machines. VR based simulated environments can help\nemployees stay informed about the latest safety norms and how to utilize the\nsafety procedures to their advantage.\n\nA virtually created life-threatening or dangerous situation like an accident\nor a hazardous machine fault can be best shown, and the remedies can be best\nexemplified with a VR and AR-based simulated training environment. The\nsimulated environment created by using VR technology also helps to leave a\ngreat positive impression on the employee psyche. It can always help him to\nprepare well for any such situation.\n\nThis is just the beginning of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)\nto be utilized in the recruitment, training, and HR processes of the\nenterprises. In the years to come, we can expect more companies to join the\nbandwagon of AR and VR based recruitment and HR management processes.\n\n_**Are you using AR, VR to transform the recruitment process?

Othamar Gama Filho, CEO at Talentify,\nsays, Instead of relying on outdated strategies to achieve that, why should\nyou switch to a mobile-first automated approach?**_\n\nIf your company is having trouble finding and retaining workers, you're not\nalone: Employee recruitment and retainment remain a significant challenge for\ncompanies across industries. According to CareerBuilder, [50% of human\nresources managers](http://press.careerbuilder.com/2019-03-05-Forty-Percent-\nof-Employers-Plan-to-Hire-Full-Time-Workers-This-Year-Forty-Seven-Percent-\nRecruiting-Part-Time-Workers) say they currently have open positions for which\nthey can't find qualified candidates.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nBut this is hardly the only difficulty: With a globalized workforce and\nfeatures such as \"easy apply,\" companies need to identify which candidates are\nworth pursuing. One of the main goals is to have more quality applications in\nthe Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and a healthy pipeline of candidates for\neach position or company location.\n\nCumberland Farms, a major US convenience store chain with over 550 locations,\nwas looking to achieve this goal. They were aiming to create a robust and\nbrand-leveraged foundation from organic channels and then see whether they\nneeded to top up through traditional job boards and paid resources. By turning\nto an AI recruitment marketing platform, Cumberland leveraged a mobile-first\nengagement strategy that brought a record conversion rate on mobile, over ten\ntimes the industry average.\n\nWhat were the main aspects of the strategy, and what valuable lesson does this\ncase offer to anyone looking to streamline their recruitment?\n\n## **Organic job optimization to the forefront**\n\nLike many other companies, Cumberland's past approach was to advertise on\nthird-party recruiting sites \u2013 something that didn't prove cost-effective. The\nnew strategy instead prioritized an attraction model built on a strong online\nbrand presence and in-store marketing to secure interest from walk-in\napplications and local footfall traffic.\n\nAll of this had to be centered around mobile users. More people, and\nespecially younger generations, are on-the-go and want to have comfortable and\nflexible access from their devices. Even people who apply via desktop tend to\nconduct a preliminary search on mobile. So, in short, a mobile-first strategy\nis fundamental when attracting people to apply to your jobs.\n\nThen, you should take your mobile-first experience and focus it on both online\nand offline organic job optimization and enhance it further with different,\ninnovative features. In the case of Cumberland's, this included three main\naspects:\n\n### **1\\. Increased reach**\n\n  \nCumberland's open positions were distributed on online channels such as Jobs\non Facebook, Google for Jobs, and natural search engine optimization (SEO).\nThis is the key to success in a world increasingly driven by social media and\nonline interaction. Jobs on Facebook, with over two billion unique users per\nmonth, and Google for Jobs, search engine icon, and the king of data, are both\nin a unique position to access new talent.\n\nTo streamline the offline experience, it was ensured that all store marketing\nand walk-in applications were supported by a text to apply knowledge, allowing\nanyone to use with unprecedented ease.\n\n### **2\\. Higher quality of candidates**\n\n  \nBy changing the way that candidates read job descriptions, it was assured that\npotential candidates were interested in the specific position and that they\nmet the necessary requirements before being allowed to apply.\n\nThose who most closely matched the criteria provided their name, email, and\nphone before being redirected to the ATS to complete the full Cumberland Farms\njob application. Those who didn't match the requirements were redirected to\ndifferent positions: This innovative feature guarantees that applicants\nweren't wasting their time and that companies could reutilize those resources,\nmaintaining a healthy conversion rate.\n\n### **3\\. Geofencing to drive ROI**\n\n  \nWithout accurate geotargeting, the number of applicants could be higher \u2013 but\nless relevant. Added to that, workers with shorter commutes tend to stay in\ntheir jobs longer. So by using GPS and radiofrequency to set up a virtual\nperimeter, extremely precise targeting was ensured.\n\nFor difficult markets, Cumberland Farms learned to leverage optimized\nprogrammatic job advertising to augment the organic strategy and drive down\nthe typical costs associated with paid-for channels. An AI-driven technology\nautomatically adjusted bids and diverted budget to focus spend on the job\nboards that found the highest quality candidates, issuing stop click on spam\napplications and low-quality sites. At the same time, it capped the spend\nwhenever the minimum number of high-quality candidates had been found, and the\ndesired results had been achieved.\n\n**Learn More:[5 Reasons Workplace Technology Impacts Recruiting & Retaining\nTalent](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/5-reasons-workplace-technology-impacts-recruiting-retaining-\ntalent/)**\n\n## **Jobs on Facebook as (un)surprising frontrunner**\n\nThrough organic job optimization, Cumberland Farms reached more quality\ncandidates at a lower cost. Filters and geolocations served as the applicant\nquality safeguards, and the collected data further suggested which candidates\nto prioritize. And through constant optimization, bid adjustments, and budget\ndiverting, the same resources were utilized to their best potential. But what\nspecific improvements did the strategy bring?\n\n  * 60% increase in the volume of quality candidates per month from organic sources;\n  * 52% increase in mobile conversions (as compared to a market average of 2-10%);\n  * The diversification of natural channels (automated remarketing, Facebook, SEO), creating a more substantial online presence for the brand. \n\n  \nInterestingly, perhaps the most distinctive achievement of the strategy was\nthe overwhelming results of Jobs on Facebook. Within just four months,\nFacebook became the company's number one source of candidates. Thanks to the\nlightweight application form that required only a few inputs, applicants on\nFacebook were twice as likely to complete the entire application than\ncandidates on Cumberland Farms' best-performing paid job board.\n\n## The lesson on recruitment in the 2020s\n\nSo what can other companies do to follow in the steps of Cumberland Farms and\nturn their recruitment strategies around? They must prioritize a mobile-first\napproach. According to 2019 statistics, [85% of\napplicants](https://blog.talentifyhr.com/innovate-your-way-out-of-workforce-\nproblems) used the mobile experience to apply for jobs. Mobile conversion\nrates were also double that of the desktop. The lesson is simple: If your\ncareer site isn't optimized for mobile, then you're missing out on some\nsubstantial human talent.\n\nRecruitment advertising shows little difference from any other digital\nmarketing. This means that the more roadblocks you put in the way of your\ntarget audience, the fewer of them will convert into the leads you're looking\nfor. It's believed that slow pages can result in up to 40% fewer conversions\nfrom applicants. That's why companies should use software that engages the\nvisitors quickly, offers a seamless experience (with fast pages and without\nthe need to repeat information), and enables recruiters to receive real-time\nnotifications.\n\n**Learn More:[3 Creative Ways to Recruit Tech\nTalent](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/creative-ways-to-recruit-tech-talent/)**\n\nCompanies also need to target appropriately and ensure that click and apply\nbots are filtered to drive more efficient mobile-first strategies. Companies\ncan then use pre-screening to focus on those candidates who meet the job\ncriteria and make sure to establish strong and engaging interactions to keep\nthem interested.\n\nTo enter the future of recruitment, companies need to leverage innovative\ntechnologies such as geofencing, SEO, candidate quality screening, and Jobs on\nFacebook, to name just a few.

Dr. Greg Barnett, SVP of\nScience at The Predictive Index, shares tips to align your business and talent\nstrategies to achieve success.**_\n\nWhen thinking about your company's business goals for 2020, do the words\n_talent strategy_ come to mind? If not, you're not alone. Most companies don't\nhave [talent strategies](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/facing-recruitment-challenges-in-2020-internal-and-external-\nstrategies-for-success/), and those that do aren't mapping those strategies to\nbusiness objectives. In today's war on talent, businesses that align talent\nand business goals are more likely to attract and retain exemplary employees\nwhile also cutting costs. This year, when devising a talent strategy to\nachieve optimal business results, it is essential to keep the following things\nin mind.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n## **Bad hires are prevalent**\n\nA recent\n[report](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200122005231/en/Companies-\nAlign-Talent-Business-Strategy-Outperform-16) found that employees are a\ncompany's most significant expense and most valuable asset. While you might\nthink this is a given, in 2019, executives shared that 51% of employees hired\ndid not end up being an excellent behavioral or cognitive fit for the company.\nAsk yourself, what percentage of your company costs can be attributed to\nemployee-related? You will most likely find that over 60% of your company's\nvalues are related to employees and [labor\ncosts](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/artificial-intelligence-and-the-future-of-human-labor/). Now\nimagine almost half of that amount being thrown away. On the face of it, this\nseems inherently inefficient and yet business leaders end up repeating this\nprocess year after year.\n\nOnce a talent strategy is in place, how can business leaders bolster\n[retention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/the-\nimportance-of-employee-retention-the-key-to-a-successful-business/)? The same\nreport also found that when companies implement talent strategies, turnover\nrates dropped to an average of only 17%. Losing high performers slows down\nstrategic initiatives, hurts morale, and increases costs. Research from\n[Cascio (2006)](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Human-Resources-Productivity-\nQuality/dp/0078112958) and[ Mitchell, Holtom, and Lee\n(2001)](https://www.csus.edu/indiv/s/sablynskic/documents/keepingyourbest_000.pdf)\nestimated that the direct and indirect damages of turnover could be anywhere\nfrom 90-200% of the exiting employee's salary.\n\n## **Keep your entire organization aligned**\n\nNow that you have a talent strategy, what's next? Too often, there's a\ndisconnect between strategy creation and execution, which ultimately leads to\nbusiness inefficiencies. Think of the talent strategy as part of the blueprint\nof your company. It needs to work in tandem with your financial plan and\norganizational structure to build a robust framework that will help your\ncompany succeed.\n\nEveryone within your organization must understand your strategies inside and\nout. From the C-Suite to junior staff, everyone needs to know how their work\ncontributes to the success of the business. This alignment starts at the top\nand flows down to the hiring process. You can go through hundreds of\napplicants that have the right talent for the open position, but will they fit\ninto the culture? It is critical that before a single interview is held, that\nall levels of the hiring team know what qualities are required to find the\nright fit for the company. Executives can make the process easier by clearly\ndisplaying the business's goals and strategies to the entire organization to\nensure everyone is on the same page.\n\n**Learn More:[9 Best Strategies to Retain Your\nEmployees](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/strategies-to-retain-your-employees/)**\n\n## **Engagement is everything**\n\n[Employee engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/how-the-digital-age-has-transformed-employee-engagement/) is\nessential for unveiling how companies can get the most out of their people and\n[retain top talent](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/how-to-nurture-and-retain-best-talent-at-your-workplace/). With 58%\nof U.S. employers unable to find skilled talent to fill job openings,\nunderstanding how to keep existing ability engaged is vital. According to a\nrecent report, only 71% of the U.S. workforce feel engaged at work. When an\nemployee is involved in their work, they go the extra mile to move the\ncompany's mission forward. Most executives think that they have to choose\nbetween employee fulfillment and employee productivity, but this is not true,\nboth can be achieved with the right tools.\n\nCreating a motivating company culture, providing opportunities for growth,\ncommunicating [employee\nfeedback](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/rethinking-the-employee-experience-in-humancentric-workplaces/),\nand providing your employees with a healthy work-life balance are just a few\nways you can improve employee engagement within your organization. Employee\nexperience surveys can also be an excellent way for senior business leaders to\nlearn what areas of the business strategy are working best, and which ones\nneed to be improved. These surveys might bring to light what employee's within\nyour organization value most. For example, while free snacks might seem\nimportant, employees may prefer leaving early on Fridays to beat traffic. The\nsooner you embrace the idea that engagement is beneficial for employees and\nemployers alike, the sooner you can address engagement gaps and see results.\n\n**Learn More:[Added Value of a PEO: Ensuring Better Recruitment and\nRetention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/added-value-of-a-peo-ensuring-better-recruitment-and-retention/)**\n\n## **The key to unlocking results**\n\nTalent strategy isn't some buzzword that'll come and go. It's becoming a\npermanent fixture of executive planning. As a car needs fuel, businesses need\nboth a business strategy and a talent strategy. When these strategies are\naligned and put into action, overall business performance will improve.\n\n_**Do share**_ _**tips for aligning your business and talent strategies with\nus\non[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=5815&zd_term=chiradeepbasumallick&zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=5844&zd_term=jennaeastman&zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=5856&zd_term=stuarthearn),\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-\ntechnologist/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=5815&zd_term=chiradeepbasumallick&zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=5844&zd_term=jennaeastman&zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=5856&zd_term=stuarthearn),\nor\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist?lang=en?&zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=5815&zd_term=chiradeepbasumallick&zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=5844&zd_term=jennaeastman&zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=5856&zd_term=stuarthearn)**_\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fmaking-talent-a-top-priority-from-hr-department-to-the-\ncsuite-2%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Making+Talent+a+Top+Priority+-+From+HR+Department+to+the+C-Suite\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Making+Talent+a+Top+Priority+-+From+HR+Department+to+the+C-Suite&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fmaking-talent-a-top-priority-from-hr-department-to-the-\ncsuite-2%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fmaking-talent-a-top-priority-from-hr-department-to-the-\ncsuite-2%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fmaking-talent-a-top-priority-from-hr-department-to-the-\ncsuite-2%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Making Talent a Top Priority - From HR\nDepartment to the\nC-Suite&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fmaking-talent-a-top-priority-from-hr-department-to-the-\ncsuite-2%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

Law.com\u2019s reporters around the world are covering the\nvirus\u2019 impact on law firm operations, client business, law schools, and lawyer\nand staffer safety. Here\u2019s a collection of our coverage, which we\u2019re\ncontinuously updating.\n\n[News](/legaltechnews/news/)\n\n# COVID-19 Shifts Law Firms' Hiring, Onboarding Process Online\u2014To a Limit\n\n#### Law firms say they've had to heavily rely on technology as they add new\nlawyers and staffers to their firms. But there can be challenges in moving the\nhiring and onboarding process completely online.\n\nBy [**Victoria\nHudgins**](https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/author/profile/Victoria-Hudgins/)\n| March 31, 2020 at 10:00 AM\n\n________[__](http://www.almreprints.com \"ALM Reprints\")\n\nX\n\n## Share with Email\n\nSend\n\nsending now...\n\n## Thank you for sharing!\n\nYour article was successfully shared with the contacts you provided.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, more law firms are heavily relying on technology\nand videoconferencing to hire and onboard attorneys and staff during the\nCOVID-19 crisis. However, many wont be able to achieve 100% remote onboarding.\n\nRecently, law firms said they\u2019ve shifted any in-person interviews to video and\nphone chats. Likewise, once a lawyer or staffer is hired, their laptops and\nother equipment are shipped to them, and orientation and other new hire\nprotocols are made on the phone or through video conference platforms.\n\nSome in-person requirements have also been relaxed. On [March\n20](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/dhs-announces-flexibility-requirements-\nrelated-form-i-9-compliance), the Department of Homeland Security gave law\nfirms and other employers some flexibility when it eased its in-person review\nrequirement for I-9 documentation to verify an employee\u2019s identity and\nemployment authorization.\n\nBut there are still some barriers to going fully remote. Take, for example,\ngetting a new partner\u2019s book of business.\n\n\u201cTypically that lateral would get releases from their client [for] both\nphysical and electronic files to the firm they\u2019re leaving and joining,\u201d said\nFox Rothschild chief talent officer Jean Durling.\n\nShe noted that if the lawyer\u2019s former firm doesn\u2019t have remote access\ncapabilities, accessing physical files could be a challenge. \u201cIt would be out\nof our hands; we can\u2019t control what goes on in another firm.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, moving to remote onboarding isn\u2019t a huge change for some.\n\nBoutique patent firm Harrity & Harrity, for instance, said it will replace its\nin-person final meeting before making a hiring decision with a video\nconference, said partner Paul Harrity. Still, that exception isn\u2019t unique to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Harrity noted that the firm previously onboarded a new\nstaffer who was working remotely after the birth of a child.\n\nRemote onboarding also doesn\u2019t just extend to interviews and formal HR and IT\ncommunication needs. New hires need to build camaraderie with lawyers they\u2019ve\nnever personally met. To this end, law firms are looking to encourage more\nphone calls and video conferencing.\n\n\u201cLaterals that are in the [hiring] process with us we\u2019ve already scheduled\nfollow-up calls that would typically take place in an office to keep them\nengaged,\u201d said Fox Rothschild\u2019s Durling. She said the firm plans to schedule\nmore frequent video and phone conference meetings held by department chairs\nfor their practice members.\n\nEve Howard, regional managing partner of Hogan Lovells\u2019 Washington, D.C.,\noffice, has seen a similar change. \u201cMeeting people in person that\u2019s always\npreferred, [but] now those meetings are happening through video technology. We\ncall that internal profile raising, we are now doing that with Skype and other\nvideo conferencing.\u201d\n\nWhile fostering introductions and building networking opportunities between\nnew lawyers must take place via phone conferences and video chats, they can be\ndone in a \u201cfun\u201d way to maintain engagement, noted Crowell & Moring chief human\nresources officer Marguerite Eastwood.\n\nShe described a conference call two weeks ago where lawyers discussed their\npuppies and kids to foster lighthearted discussions and connections with\ncolleagues who would usually work in an office together.\n\n__share on facebook __share on twitter\n\n## Victoria Hudgins\n\n[ ]( https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/author/profile/Victoria-Hudgins/)\n\nI am a reporter for Legaltech News, where I cover national and international\ncyber regulations and legal tech innovations and developments.\n\n[More from this author\n__](https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/author/profile/Victoria-Hudgins/)\n\n## Dig Deeper\n\n  * [Software](/topics/software/)\n  * [Law Firm Hiring](/topics/law-firm-hiring/)\n\nInstant Insights[As Coronavirus Spreads, Legal Industry Shifts into Crisis\nManagement Mode](/instant-insights/as-coronavirus-spreads-legal-industry-\nshifts-into-crisis-management-mode-7/)\n\n  * News\n\n![](https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/398/2020/03/Carl-\nNichols-James-Boasberg-Colleen-Kollar-Kotelly-Article-202003311430.jpg)\n\n[Coronavirus Complaints Against Feds Start Piling Up in DC Trial\nCourt](//www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/03/31/coronavirus-complaints-\nagainst-feds-start-piling-up-in-dc-trial-court/)\n\n[Read More \u203a](//www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2020/03/31/coronavirus-\ncomplaints-against-feds-start-piling-up-in-dc-trial-court/)\n\n  * News\n\n![](https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/292/2020/04/Fieldfisher-\nArticle-201811271438.jpg)\n\n[UK-Based Fieldfisher Tells Lawyers and Staff to Use 25% of Leave Before End\nof June](//www.law.com/2020/04/01/fieldfisher-tells-staff-to-use-25-of-annual-\nleave-before-end-of-june-292-64507/)\n\n[Read More \u203a](//www.law.com/2020/04/01/fieldfisher-tells-staff-to-use-25-of-\nannual-leave-before-end-of-june-292-64507/)\n\n  * News\n\n![](https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/389/2020/03/Court-of-\nAppeals-Article-202003311924.jpg)\n\n[New York Court of Appeals Calls for Bar Exam in 'Early\nSeptember'](//www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/03/31/new-york-court-of-\nappeals-calls-for-bar-exam-in-early-september/)\n\n[Read More \u203a](//www.law.com/newyorklawjournal/2020/03/31/new-york-court-of-\nappeals-calls-for-bar-exam-in-early-september/)\n\n  * News\n\n![](https://images.law.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/292/2020/03/Dean-\nDouglas-Sylvester-of-ASU-College-of-Law.-2011.-Credit_-David-\nSanders.-Article-202003311408-1.jpg)\n\n[With Pass/Fail Now the Norm, Outlier Law Schools Face Student\nBacklash](//www.law.com/2020/03/31/with-passfail-now-the-norm-outlier-law-\nschools-face-student-backlash/)\n\n[Read More \u203a](//www.law.com/2020/03/31/with-passfail-now-the-norm-outlier-law-\nschools-face-student-backlash/)\n\n[![](https://legalcompass.intelligence.alm.com/Images/logos/270x227_red\\[1\\]_New.jpg)](https://legalcompass.intelligence.alm.com/#/employmentdetails/lawyers)\n\n#### [The Competitive Landscape is\nChanging](https://legalcompass.intelligence.alm.com/#/employmentdetails/lawyers)\n\nWhere are competitors expanding?

The Answer Lies in a \u201c5M Model\u201d**\n\nIf employees get a negative impression of or face major bottlenecks in the\nworkplace in the first few months, it could drive them to leave the\norganization. So early in the employee journey, they are still not rooted in\nthe organizational culture, and this makes the separation easier. To prevent\nthis, companies need a five-step employee training plan that addresses the\nneeds of new employees head-on.\n\n![The five Ms of an effective employee training plan](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig. 1. The five Ms of an effective employee training plan**\n\n###\n\n### **1. _Mitigate_ the steep learning curve**\n\n  \nMost employees joining your company will have a steep learning curve in the\ninitial stages.\n\nThis is especially true for fresh graduates who have joined the workforce for\nthe first time. Even mid-career professionals who are transitioning from a\ndifferent field could face difficulties in acclimatizing themselves to the\nexpectations of their new roles.\n\nThese employees need to feel comfortable and confident so that they can easily\nacquire new skills/knowledge.\n\nThis involves three steps:\n\n**a. Conduct group onboarding:** To alleviate any newcomer anxiety, it\u2019s a\ngood idea to conduct group\n[**onboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) where recruits can connect with\nother employees who are going through a similar experience.\n\nEssential employee training elements, such as compliance, workforce management\nprotocol, and HR policies, can be explained during group onboarding sessions.\n\nYou can then hold short tests, polls, and quizzes to check for knowledge\nretention \u2013 and follow up with interactive emails after one week to overcome\nthe forgetting curve.\n\n**b. Assign an \u201cearly-days\u201d mentor:** Unlike a typical mentorship program, an\nearly-days mentor wouldn\u2019t aim for outcome-focused employee training. Instead,\nthe mentor is a friend to the new employee, ready to solve queries, answer\nquestions, and assist them in their daily job.\n\nKeep in mind the 70:20:10 equation, which suggests that 70% of learning\nhappens through experience, 20% by interacting with one\u2019s immediate community,\nand 10% through formal learning. Assigning a mentor strengthens the impact of\nthat 20% in your employee training plan.\n\n**c. Allocate one week for shadowing:** By introducing employees to complex\nconcepts and theoretical knowledge, companies risk overwhelming the learner\nwhen they have just joined the organization.\n\nA designated week for shadowing allows new employees to observe their\npeers/seniors, ask questions, and gain a real-world understanding of the job.\n\n### **2. _Mobilize_ new employees\u2019 existing strengths **\n\n  \nOnce an employee has crossed the initial learning phase, it\u2019s time to nurture\nthe potential for which they were hired.\n\nAn employee may not immediately fit in with their assigned team or be able to\ncollaborate with their manager. In such situations, focus on employees\u2019\nexisting strengths so that they aren\u2019t demotivated. This is relevant\nspecifically for employees venturing into a new career path or when they have\ntaken on a new role in the organization. Several skills are inherently\ntransferable (soft skills like communication or hard skills like design) and\nshould be showcased at this stage of your employee training plan.\n\nThis involves three steps:\n\n**a. Adopt strength-based coaching:** Coaching is no longer limited to senior\nexecutives. Mobile platforms like Pluma make coaching sessions accessible to\nmiddle managers and frontline employees.\n\nStrength-based coaching highlights what an employee can do best and nurtures\nthis potential. This coaching tactic can also inspire employees more\neffectively than critical feedback, minimizing the risk of demotivation.\n\n**b. Find cross-department synergies:** After employees shadow their own team\nmembers in the first week on the job, allow them to shadow managers in\ndifferent departments and business units in the following weeks. This will\nhelp them understand your company's vision more clearly and help them\nfamiliarize themselves with the various departments, their roles, the bearing\nof these departments on employees' work.\n\nIn some cases, cross-departmental synergies can be leveraged at a later stage\nto address skill gaps through\n[i](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/why-\ninternal-mobility-is-key-to-building-the-workforce-of-the-future/)nternal\nmobility. That's why this step is so essential for your employee training\nplan.\n\n**c. Take a reverse-mentoring approach:** Reverse mentoring occurs when a\nsenior executive is paired with a new/junior employee to encourage a free-\nflowing, non-linear skills exchange.\n\nBy participating in a reverse mentorship, employees can forge new connections\nwith their colleagues (cutting across generational divides), and discover\nunique strengths that could add value to your company.\n\n**3. _Maintain_ a regular learning track**\n\n  \nThe first two steps focus on empowering new employees and helping them obtain\nthe soft skills needed to interact meaningfully with their teams.\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to implement a formal L&D; plan that incorporates self-learning\nand classroom learning sessions in equal measure. Classroom sessions are\nvital, as they add structure to the employee learning journey and help track\ntheir progress in real-time.\n\nFor this, you would benefit from using e-learning platforms with analytics\ncapabilities.\n\nThis step comprises three further steps:\n\n**a. Offer mobile learning opportunities:** In the first few months, an\nemployee will be engaged in interactions with multiple stakeholders to find a\nfirm foothold in the organizational structure.\n\nAs a result, they may not be able to dedicate uninterrupted hours to learning\nand development. You can address this by incorporating mobile learning into\nyour employee training plan. This may prove particularly beneficial for\nmillennials and Gen Z, who are mobile-natives.\n\n**b. Ensure in-the-moment learning is available** : Coming back to the\n70:20:10 formula, 70% of all learning occurs through work experience. This\nmakes in-the-moment learning an integral component of your employee training\nplan, and even more so for employees who are new to your workflows.\n\nCoaching tips embedded in productivity applications, informative alerts, and\ntimely redirection to learning resources can help employees learn as they\nwork.\n\n**c. Leverage real-time learning data:** Employees mustn't veer from their\nlearning tracks, at least in the first few months of joining a company. You\ncan ensure this by monitoring learners' progress in real-time and sharing\nreports with the employee.\n\nThis will aid in self-motivation.\n\n### **4. _Monitor_ progress with controlled tests**\n\n  \nLearning data may not always accurately portray the progress that an employee\nhas achieved. Here\u2019s where controlled tests can make a difference. These tests\nplace the employee in real-world scenarios, urging them to try out their newly\nacquired skills for meaningful output.\n\nDo note that employees must feel like they are in a _safe_ environment when\nactioning these skills without any worries around being reprimanded.\n\nThis involves three steps:\n\n**a. Simulate real-world work scenarios:** Now is the time for organizations\nto incorporate cutting-edge technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and\nvirtual reality (VR) to test employee skills in simulated, safe environments.\nThis way, tests are decoupled from critical outcomes, but the employee still\nhas a chance to experience the impact of hands-on training memorably.\n\nYou can even embed visual cues and coaching tips into the AR/VR experience,\nacknowledging the right use of skills and alerting employees wherever they go\nwrong.\n\n**b. Hold \u201c100% ownership days\u201d:** This extends the ambit of testing a little\nfurther. On 100% ownership days, the recruit is given end-to-end\nresponsibility for a specific task, including customer interactions, decision-\nmaking, and micro-level leadership.\n\nThis component of your employee training plan allows employees to study the\nimpact of work in day-to-day situations. Of course, a manager/supervisor must\nbe present at hand to intervene if necessary.\n\n**c. Recognize learning achievements:** A significant part of monitoring\nprogress is to recognize and appreciate the milestones that an employee has\nsuccessfully crossed. This may range from a simple \u201cthank you\u201d for easing a\nteam member\u2019s workload, to a formal email announcement when the employee\nattains a mandatory certification.\n\nRecognition also allows learners to track their progress over time, motivating\nthem to accelerate their journey on the learning curve.\n\n**5. _Measure_ at increasing intervals**\n\n  \nContinuous review, along with regular fine-tuning, is essential for any\nemployee training plan, and this applies to new employees well. It is\nadvisable to increase the measurement interval on an incremental basis. The\nfirst checkpoint is every week for the first month. Then, measure learning\nprogress every month for the next quarter. Finally, move to a quarterly\nmeasurement cycle.\n\nThis will ease the learning curve we spoke about in step 1 and allow employees\nto gradually blend into your existing workforce and its culture of learning.\n\nThis step involves three elements:\n\n**a. Check for individual as well as team-wise outcomes:** Individual\nperformance can only go so far. Employees must display key traits like\nteamwork, collaboration, the ability to empathize with colleagues, and\nnecessary foresight.\n\nLearning measurement must factor in team-wise outcomes. We recommend using\npre-onboarding findings as a benchmark and assessing the value the employee\nadds to the team after joining.\n\n**b. Pay equal attention to hard and soft skills:** Too often, an employee\u2019s\nhard skills are highlighted, while their \u201csoft\u201d capabilities (which are\nequally important) pass under the radar. It can be challenging to measure\nprogress in terms of soft skills development. This is where you need peer\nreviews and 360-degree performance feedback.\n\nThe employee\u2019s team members, as well as colleagues from other teams who\ninteracted with them in the _mobilize_ stage, can rate the impact of training\nin terms of soft skills.\n\n**c. Prioritize culture fitment and add for the first year:** One cannot\noverestimate the role of culture fit, and eventually culture add in the\nemployee experience and employees\u2019 overall success in the organization.\n\nYour employee training plan must necessarily include training on the company\u2019s\nculture, from diversity and inclusion to company policies, values, and ethics.\nOnce again, use peer reviews to understand how the culture fit and culture add\nhave improved from week 1 to month 1 to quarter 1, and finally, to year 1.\n\n## **#ProTip: _Maneuver_ the New Employee Learning Experience Using the Right\nTools **\n\nTraining new employees is a multifaceted and dynamic process. No employee\ntraining plan is a set-and-forget initiative, which is why learning analytics\nis so important. Regular tests and data monitoring reveal how employees are\nprogressing across the learning track designed for them to reach their full\nproductivity potential.\n\nBy following the 5M model, companies can address both expressed and latent\nemployee expectations and streamline their learning and development path in\nthe organization.\n\nStrengthen this path further by using targeted learning tools. Here are three\nexamples of such tools:\n\n**1.**[ **SAP Litmos**](https://www.litmos.com/platform/new-employee-training)\n**:** Litmos is the learning management solution (LMS) from the global\nsoftware giant SAP. Litmos has a robust training module, which includes a\ndedicated capability for new employee training management.\n\nYou can leverage Litmos for compliance training \u2013 one of the key elements of\nany onboarding experience \u2013 as well as for knowledge dissemination in\nspecialized business, social, and technical topics. Further, Litmos is easily\nscalable based on your hiring speed and capacity.\n\n**2.**[ **Eloomi**](https://eloomi.com/) **:** Eloomi is an onboarding\nplatform that pays special attention to how you train new employees. The\nplatform has several built-in content programs that can be customized based on\nyour employee training plan.\n\nYou can reuse frequently implemented learning materials in areas such as\nsecurity and compliance. And view progress across all these paths in real-\ntime, with follow-ups via face-to-face meetings. As an additional feature,\nEloomi offers preboarding capabilities for greater candidate/employee\nengagement.\n\n**3.** [**Talmundo**](https://www.talmundo.com/onboarding-software-solution)\n**:** Talmundo\u2019s onboarding software offers an effective solution to train new\nemployees. The employee starts receiving notifications as early as 10 days\nbefore joining the company. These notifications share information on the\ncompany\u2019s overall positioning as well as job-related information.\n\nTalmundo covers the entire new-hire lifecycle \u2013 for example, at the 60-day\nmilestone, it asks onboarding employees about their specific areas of interest\nthat they would like to develop across their tenure.\n\n## **Wrapping Up**\n\nPlatforms like SAP Litmos, Eloomi, and Talmundo can make your employee\ntraining plan productive and successful. Coupled with the 5M model, you can\nhone a new employee\u2019s true potential and enable them to maximize their\nperformance.\n\nThe key is to anticipate initial bottlenecks, institute measures that\nstreamline the learning experience, and blend employee training with the\nworkplace experience.

Linda Van of ADP TotalSource breaks down how a\nPEO can help organizations remain attractive, grow their business and position\nthemselves as an employer of choice.**_\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nBuilding retention strategies and executing recruitment initiatives can get\nsidelined by the day-to-day HR responsibilities of processing payroll,\nmanaging benefits, and training employees. It's a big reason why small and\nmid-sized businesses are increasingly partnering with Professional Employer\nOrganizations (PEOs). PEOs provide companies a comprehensive range of services\nto support administrative payroll, HR, and benefits responsibilities. PEOs can\nalso help businesses with highly-critical projects such as preparing for\ngrowth and identifying retention risk areas within an organization. The\nfollowing are some of the ways a PEO can bring value to a company.\n\n## **Added Benefits for** **Recruitment and Retention**\n\nWinning talent is critical to a business\u2019 success, and the current tight labor\nmarket has businesses clamoring for skilled employees. A PEO provides the\nability to tap into a vast network of job seekers to help source the best\ncandidates for a particular business. For small businesses, this can be an\ninvaluable offering.\n\nAdditionally, the right employee benefits package can help to attract and\nretain talent, as well as lead to greater productivity and higher quality work\namong employees. In a market such as Hawaii, dominated by small to mid-sized\ncompanies, a PEO service can give employers an edge in attracting and keeping\ntalented employees because PEOs can access benefits not otherwise available or\naffordable for small businesses. PEOs don\u2019t only provide scale, they also\nprovide employers the ability to offer multiple benefits options to provide\nfor the varied needs of their employee population.\n\nFor example, ADP TotalSource\u2019s recent expansion to Hawaii includes strategic\npartnerships with local, on-island benefit carriers, as well as national\ncarriers for out-of-state employees. Beyond the expected options (medical,\ndental, vision, life, disability, and voluntary), ADP TotalSource\u2019s benefits\ninclude offerings employees wouldn\u2019t expect, such as retail discounts, a\ndedicated team to coordinate health care (Health Advocate), an [Employee\nAssistance Program](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-\nwellness/are-your-employees-fine-or-are-they-flourishing/) (counseling, senior\ncaregiving services, legal and financial consultations, etc.), and a 401k\nprogram to save for retirement.\n\n**Learn More:[9 Best Strategies to Retain Your\nEmployees](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/strategies-to-retain-your-employees/)**\n\n## **Ongoing Professional Development**\n\nAnother way PEOs help employers attract and retain employees is by investing\nin professional development. Some PEOs, like ADP TotalSource, have built-in\ntraining and development courses employees can take online. ADP TotalSource\neven hosts learning and development courses in person, which can go a long way\nto help employees feel valued.\n\nPEOs can also guide employers as they create a program to track employee\nperformance and promotion readiness. By allowing employers to have visibility\nto an employee\u2019s challenge, employers can work to help improve performance and\nguide their employees to success. With a PEO\u2019s technology, business owners can\ndiscover easy alternatives to track employee growth and development, as well\nas productivity through scheduling, timekeeping, and attendance.\n\n## **Support Compliance**\n\nCompliance can be a daunting business challenge, as it is ever-changing and if\nnot executed correctly, could have major implications for a business. From\nrequiring expertise in tax reporting adherence, unemployment and workers\u2019\ncompensation insurance, Affordable Care Act, COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus\nBudget Reconciliation Act), and employment laws, such as Americans with\nDisabilities Act, Fair Labor Standard Act, and Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC) regulations, keeping up with all compliance obligations can\nbe a struggle for small- and mid-sized businesses. However, it doesn\u2019t have to\nbe. This day-to-day work can be facilitated through a PEO to free up the\nbusiness\u2019 HR to focus on other necessary tasks, such as recruitment and\nretention. Through handbooks, training, and proactive strategies, a\n[PEO](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/compensation-benefits/managing-\nhr-administration-hris-or-peo/) can help companies protect themselves from\nfines, claims, and penalties whenever an employment issue arises. Most\nimportantly, partnering with a PEO for compliance gives employers peace of\nmind and lets them focus on their recruitment and retention strategies \u2014 which\nultimately contributes to better and more sustainable growth.\n\n**Learn More:[How Healthy Turnover Can Lead to Long-term Talent\nRetention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-\nhealthy-turnover-can-lead-to-longterm-talent-retention/)**\n\n## **Drive Workforce Success**\n\nAs the needs of the workforce evolve, so must the approach to address the\nshifting world of work. Amid changing business regulations, increased\ncompliance challenges, and a tight labor market, a PEO can deliver the\nservices needed to help businesses remain attractive.

By analyzing the scaled data, HR can better\nsupport business decisions. With these facts, they can move from the bottom\nline and change their relationship with the senior management team. This way,\nHR could have a stronger position on the board of a company. They could\nmeasure their own and the employees\u2019 performance, and with time they can\ncompare it to different timelines.\n\nWe can approach the importance of HR analytics from two sides. On the one\nhand, without measurable results, HR is not able to prevail at the business\nlevel. To represent its interests, HR should be able to conjugate statistics\nwith its achievements. On the other hand, HR analytics is also known as people\nanalytics. It revolves around analyzing people's problems using data to answer\ncritical questions about an organization.\n\nThe [Games for Business](https://gamesforbusiness.com/) team has gathered some\nareas that HR should keep an eye on in their daily lives.\n\n####  **1\\. Employee satisfaction**\n\nPeople are the key elements of running a successful business, and HR is the\nconnection between the company and its employees.\n\nWith the recruitment process, an employee\u2019s corporate journey has just begun.\n\nAfter this critical phase, the next crucial point is onboarding, which will\nfundamentally define the employee's integration into the workplace.\n\nIt is essential to get regular feedback about our employee\u2019s wellbeing. With a\nquestionnaire, we can qualitatively measure employee satisfaction. Still, at\nthe end of the day, we shouldn't forget that human relationships need quality\ntime and good conversations in the company during a coffee break, for example.\nDissatisfaction is a major cause of employee turnover. It is vital to act on\ntime and reduce fluctuation.\n\n####  **2\\. Employee engagement**\n\nA strong level of employee engagement predicts higher productivity, better\ncustomer service, lower turnover, and many other relevant and positive\noutcomes.\n\nOur projects at Games for Business have proven that learning participation\nrates are directly related to employee engagement. At CIB Bank, employees\nvoluntarily spent 3 and 1/3 hours on average with learning about\ndigitalization processes and tools in the system. During Coca-Cola\u2019s corporate\nstrategy training campaign, employee engagement was not only strong during\nbusiness hours, but 51% of all user activity was recorded outside of working\nhours. Looking at learning participation rates, we will see the percentage of\nemployees who take part in professional courses and training sessions. Beyond\nthat, we can measure engagement with index numbers like average learning time\n(usage time of the learning system / the number of users), or average\ncompletion rate (the number of users who successfully complete the task / the\ntotal number who attempted it). If we look beyond internal learning, PwC, for\nexample, has implemented our system for an employer branding campaign, after\nwhich 77% of users changed their opinion about the company in positive ways.\n\n####  **3\\. Time to Productivity**\n\nEmployee productivity is closely related to employee satisfaction and employee\nengagement. Happy employees are more productive. In most cases, the working\nhours of a company are predefined. Companies are increasingly letting this\ntraditional mentality go. Nowadays, it doesn't matter how many hours you work\nfor a day. What matters is what you have achieved.\n\nBesides the productivity rate, it is even more important to track \u2018time to\nproductivity.\u2019 This is the average period needed for newly hired employees to\nreach the targeted level of work efficiency.\n\nThis metric tells a lot about your company's onboarding process. If you use\nour learning platform as an onboarding system, it is easy to measure time to\nproductivity. Users receive clear goals and activities they are expected to\naccomplish during a determined period. We can compare individual results with\nthe average time needed to complete the onboarding process.\n\n####  **4\\. Training effectiveness**\n\nTo measure the effectiveness of training, you need to measure what people have\nlearned. This can be tricky if you are only running traditional classroom\ntraining. In contrast, using a digital learning platform makes it much easier\nto retrieve data and communicate it to the management team.\n\nBefore the training, it is also crucial to have a placement test to assess the\naverage knowledge level in the given topic. After the training, it is also\nessential to deepen and measure the acquired knowledge based on prior\nobjectives.\n\nOne can also measure the participation rate (number of colleagues who\nparticipated in the training / number of colleagues invited to the training),\nhow costs are distributed per employee (training costs / number of training\nparticipants) or compare user results (comparing individual performance with\nthe average performance of employees).\n\n####  **5\\. 90-day quit rate**\n\nThis KPI is a turnover metric that shows the number of hires who leave the\ncompany within their first three months. It is often a critical period for\nmany companies.\n\nTypically, it is HR's job to recruit the right people and support their work\nwith a proper onboarding process. Failing to do so will have a measurable\nnegative impact on organizational effectiveness.\n\nThat is one of the reasons why Generali decided to implement our gamified\ndigital learning platform for their induction process. Since the application\nof the tool, Generali has seen an outstanding improvement in its people\u2019s\ndevelopment as well as in the sales revenue. This KPI is particularly relevant\nwhen it is combined with other features. You can see turnover rates for\nspecific worker groups such as underperformers, salespeople, millennials or\nmid-level managers, etc. Take your time to view the data from different\nangles.

New\ntechnologies and advanced hiring practices undoubtedly played a hand, and this\ndisruption shows no signs of slowing as we enter the new decade. Let's see how\ninnovation and social expertise will shape 2020 and beyond.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n### **1\\. Natural Language Processing**\n\n  \nThe single biggest trend shaping recruitment in 2020 will be the use of\nartificial intelligence (AI) to the source, assess, and screen employees. The\npower of natural language processing (NLP) tools is set to make a key change\nat every step of the way.\n\nManually screening resumes is still one of the most time-consuming tasks\nrecruiters face, but with NLP, the best applicants can be identified swiftly.\nNLP can also be used to interact with potential candidates and offer\npersonalized communication with the latest chatbot technology. Finally, NLP\nand voice recognition are being combined to help analyze and review candidate\ninterviews.\n\nHowever, human bias is easily carried into the behavior of any AI model.\nOrganizations must ensure those producing the algorithms do so in compliance\nwith the company-approved anti-bias guidelines [to avoid\nthis](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/business/algorithm-bias-fix.html)\nscenario.\n\n### **2\\. Predictive analytics**\n\n  \nRecommender systems and predictive analytics will begin to play a larger role\nin the recruiting processes of many companies.\n\nVarious technology players on the market already allow recruiters to identify\nthe best matches for a job based on numerous parameters, such as location,\npast experience, education, and relationship networks. This is taken a step\nfurther with predictive analytics and recommender systems that provide\nrecruiters with additional insights. These systems are able to generate\nselective lists of candidates who are best fitted for the job on offer and\neven uncover candidates that are not actively seeking new opportunities.\n\nIn addition to making the employee selection process faster or activating a\ndormant talent pool, intelligent systems can also signal when a current\nemployee is getting ready to quit a current job. Smart recruiters will be\nusing these insights to make the most appropriate interventions and talent\ndecisions.\n\nLearn More:\n\n### **3\\. Remote work**\n\n  \nFlexible schedules and work-from-home policies are turning into one of the\nmost sought after benefits that job candidates look for, and organizations\nneed to adapt to the work aspirations of their employees.\n\nThat's why we increasingly see more and more fully-remote companies. By\nallowing people to work remotely, companies are also increasing their talent\npool because now they can access global talent without the limitations of\ngeographical boundaries.\n\nAs such, we will see an increase in the use of tools and technologies that\nhelp manage remote teams, including virtual offices, augmented and virtual\nreality work environments, as well as advanced multi-media communication\ntools.\n\n### **4\\. Work culture**\n\n  \nCulture is the glue that binds a company together. However, the increase in\nremote work makes building and maintaining a solid company culture more\nchallenging. Therefore, it will become increasingly critical for organizations\nto put effort into rallying the employees around their core values, company\nmission, and overall vision.\n\nWe will see a rise in organizations creating a dedicated role to focus solely\non building company culture and team cohesion. Part of the challenge will be\nto blend a company culture that can be embraced by baby boomers, Gen Z, and\nMillennials - and their varying expectations and career aspirations - alike.\n\n### **5\\. Acqui-hires**\n\n  \nPeople are one of the most valuable assets in any company. While they may not\nshow up in the balance sheet, employees often represent the bulk of a\ncompany's value. That's why we are likely to see a growing number of\nacquihires happening on the market.\n\nAs recruiters increasingly spend more time and money to find the perfect\ncandidates, talent acquisition competition grows. Recruiters are therefore\nlooking to different avenues to proactively and quickly build up talent pools.\nBuying up companies for their human capital is one of these techniques.\n\nHowever, recruiters should be mindful of culture clash during this process,\nwhich can limit the smooth integration of the companies involved. Dedicating a\nmultidisciplinary team to facilitate cultural integration is paramount to the\nsuccess of all acquihires.\n\n### **6\\. Social media recruiting**\n\n  \nAs recruiters reach for the extra mile, the logical step is to go where their\npotential candidates really are, and most of them are already on social media.\nWith increased mobile usage and on-the-go interactions, recruiters will\nincreasingly capture users' attention on platforms like Facebook or Twitter.\n\nThat's why in 2020, we will witness more use of recruiting hashtags and eye-\ncatching content, including videos, as part of recruitment marketing. We will\nalso see more organizations encourage employees to share their winning content\nto lure in new employees and build up their recruiting clout.\n\n### **7\\. Diversity**\n\n  \nIt's been proven numerous times that diverse teams perform better, so ever\nmore HR departments, staffing agencies, and recruiting firms will have\ndesignated staff dedicated exclusively to increasing diversity at the\ncompanies they serve.\n\nOrganizations will put more effort into tailoring job postings to attract more\ndiverse candidates, reshape the language in job descriptions to be more\ngender-neutral, and advertise jobs in diverse community groups. We will also\nsee an increase in the number of staffing agencies that are specialized in\ndiversity, challenging the status quo around underrepresented gender, race,\nand other similar demographics.\n\nLearn More:\n\n### **8\\. Employer branding**\n\n  \nPeople want to work at companies that they can be proud of. Therefore, the\nmost important thing for an employer is to build their employer brand and make\nthe vision and mission of the company crystal clear.\n\nAccording to a [study](http://web.careerarc.com/op-employer-branding-\nstudy.html) by CareerArc, 75% of job seekers consider an employer's brand\nbefore applying, so building content around employee experience is crucial.\nThat's why we will see more organizations focused on building website sections\ndedicated to the company mission, employee life and stories, and other\nrelevant employer branding content.\n\n### **9\\. Soft skills**\n\n  \nAccording to a LinkedIn [study](https://www.fastcompany.com/90298828/linkedin-\nresearch-reveals-the-value-of-soft-skills), 89% of bad hires typically lack\nsoft skills such as creativity, persuasion, teamwork, collaboration,\nadaptability, and time management. But identifying such skills has\ntraditionally been a challenge, which is why recruiters are looking to revamp\ntheir assessment processes as the demand grows.\n\nRecruiters will be increasingly interested in learning from a candidate's body\nlanguage and choice of words, as well as previous behavioral patterns,\nteamwork dynamics, ethical dilemmas, conflict resolution, and other similar\nfactors.\n\nAnother soft skill that is gaining increased prominence is the candidates'\nability to build large networks across various industries and sectors. Digital\nplatforms allow employees to amplify the reach of any company message through\ntheir own networks, providing a significant competitive advantage in sales,\nrecruiting, fundraising, and overall reach.\n\n### **10\\. Hiring quality**\n\n  \nTechnology can be leveraged to assess new candidates, but it can also be\nprogressively used to measure the performance of the recruiting team itself.\nWhile the cost and time-to-hire are easier to quantify, the quality is a\nlittle harder to assess.\n\nRecruiters will experiment with AI models that provide deeper insights into\nthe quality of their hires by analyzing various defined metrics and overall\nperformance within the team over a set period of time. These models will take\ninto account not only hard skills and expertise but also new hires' soft\nskills and overall performance KPIs.\n\n_Do you have any recruitment trends in mind?

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nExpert Panel, Forbes Human Resources Council\n\nSuccessful HR executives from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) offer leadership and management\ninsights.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nEmployees are easy for a business to land, but the most skilled of these\nwithin the talent pool know that they are valuable and don't just jump at the\nfirst employment opportunity. Instead, they approach things differently,\nlooking for an employer with a brand that they recognize and can trust.\n\nIf a company wants to attract the upper echelons of talent within their\nindustry, their HR leaders need to understand how to build an employer brand\nsuccessfully. Not only does it make the company attractive for new potential\nemployees, but it also raises the reputation of the company within the\nemployee pool. These 15 members of[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) provide valuable insight into how a\nbusiness can go about building its employer brand.\n\nMembers explain how to build a strong, engaging employer brand for your\nrecruiting efforts.\n\nPhotos courtesy of the individual members\n\n**1\\. Think Beyond Your Logo Or Slogan**\n\nYour brand isn't a logo or slogan. It's the governing principles for how you\nconduct business and take care of your employees and customers. HR is at the\nforefront of attracting new talent and developing current talent. Your brand\nis reinforced (or ruined) by every interaction with HR and the focus should be\non creating exceptional experiences for the applicants/employees. - [Regina W.\nRomeo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/regina-w-romeo-0748207),[ CPS HR\nConsulting](http://www.cpshr.us/)\n\n**2\\. Lead With Your Values**\n\nLead with your values and company culture in a transparent way. You can do\nthis by making a prominent page on your website that outlines your corporate\nculture and structure, or even by providing a downloadable brochure about your\nbusiness to potential applicants. The employer brand starts with visibility\nand clarity, so be open from the start if you want to impress job seekers. -\n[Laura Spawn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauraspawn),[ Virtual Vocations,\nInc.](https://www.virtualvocations.com/)\n\n**3\\. Team Up With Marketing**\n\nHR should partner with marketing to promote the company brand, particularly in\nhiring and onboarding. From the website to the job ads, recruitment efforts\nshould sell the position and the company to attract qualified applicants who\nresonate with your company's values, mission and culture. During interviews\nand onboarding, HR can further promote that triad to boost engagement and\nretention. -[ Courtney Pace, Ph.D.](https://twitter.com/RevDrMom_Pace),[ FedEx\nEmployees Credit Assoc.](http://www.fecca.com/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only organization for HR\nexecutives across all industries. _**Do I qualify?**_\n\n**4\\. Share Your Story**\n\nA big part employer branding is sharing your story with applicants and\nemployees. We have a unique history, and it's important for our applicants and\nemployees to understand our history and legacy. For an employee to truly\nbecome passionate about our mission and values, they have to have a solid\nunderstanding of who we are and how we got to be the successful organization\nthat we are today. - [Dana Garaventa, GPHR,\nPHR](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danagaraventa),[ Opus One Winery\nLLC](http://www.opusonewinery.com/)\n\n**5\\. Personalize Your Storytelling**\n\nThe employer brand needs to be authentic. Potential candidates want to hear\nfrom other employees, not corporate or HR. They want to know why people stay\nat your company. What makes it special and different? Showcase real employee\nstories on your job sites and social media accounts. -[ Lotus\nBuckner](https://twitter.com/lotusbuckner),[ NCH](http://www.nch.org/)\n\n**6\\. Stand Out From The Crowd**\n\nHR leaders should identify what makes their company different from all the\nrest, then turn up the volume, speak to it, post it on social media, add it to\nthe company web pages and LinkedIn profiles. Demonstrate why it's so great to\nwork at your employer and highlight the \"specialness\" that makes you unique\nfrom all the rest. Everybody has one. -[ Charles\nAshworth](https://twitter.com/CIAshworth),[\nZendrive](https://www.zendrive.com/)\n\n**7\\. Understand The Expectations Of Each Generation**\n\nThere are five generations working alongside each other: traditionalists, baby\nboomers, Gen X, millennials and Gen Z. Employers must understand the\nexpectations of each generation with a brand that speaks to the individuality\nof each group. And the days of siloing talent -- treating permanent and\ncontingent separately -- are long gone. Put simply, it\u2019s all talent so the\nbrand needs to cater to all. -[ Kim Pope](https://twitter.com/kimpope?lang=en-\ngb),[ WilsonHCG](https://www.wilsonhcg.com/)\n\n**8\\. Ask Employees To Be Brand Ambassadors**\n\nWe let all of our employees speak out about our brand. In essence, our\nemployees serve as highly credible brand ambassadors. We built a social media\ncampaign around individual employees talking about their favorite perks (we\ncalled it \"the icing on the cupcake\"). All of our employees meet new\ncandidates during the interviewing process, sharing their perspectives about\nour business and culture. - [Gina Deciani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gina-\ndeciani-32a0b5a),[ Association for Supply Chain\nManagement](http://www.ascm.org/)\n\n**9\\. Ensure Continuous Employee Development**\n\nThe promise of continuous employee development is one of the strongest\norganizations can make to potential employees. Nearly every employee is\nmotivated by the prospect of investment in professional growth, so if an\nemployer brand can stand for commitment to learning and development it will\nstand out. Stories highlighting employees who have benefited are key in\n\"marketing\" this brand advantage. - [Heide\nAbelli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heideabelli),[\nSkillsoft](http://www.skillsoft.com/)\n\n**10\\. Control The Message**\n\nCompanies should provide a template, prompts or consistent messaging to their\nemployees to share via social media in order to increase the impact of social\nnetworks of their employees. Companies benefit from a consistent employer\nbrand because the messaging is controlled, but the social network sharing is\norganic and can be exponential beyond the employees' postings. - [Jessica\nDelorenzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicadelorenzo),[ Kimball Electronics\nInc](http://www.kimballelectronics.com/)\n\n**11\\. Utilize Social Media To Advertise Your Brand**\n\nLinkedIn, Twitter and Glassdoor are great ways to keep favorable talent in the\nloop and give insight into your employer brand. Highlight information that\nshows balance, diversity and inclusion and overall appreciation for the people\nwho work for you. Your brand is about how you serve others and that is the\nconnection that most people are looking for in strong employer brands. -\n[RaQuel Hopkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raquel-hopkins-mba-758ba2173),[\nDHI Telecom Group](https://www.dhitelecom.com/)\n\n**12\\. Sell Only What You've Got**\n\nKnow your company's values and standards. Don't market ideas and what you are\nplanning to implement soon. Be confident in what you are and represent as a\ncompany and you will find the talent that suits your needs. Top talent\nincludes cultural fit, as well. - [Reinhard\nGuggenberger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rguggenberger),[ Soaring Fox\nConsulting](http://www.soaringfox.com/en/)\n\n**13\\. Build A Culture Of Free Will**\n\nI recently took a role at a tech company and they defined their culture as\n\"one of free will.\" The brand, culture and values supported this philosophy\nonce on the inside. If you want to build a strong employer brand, the outside\nneeds to match the inside. HR leaders who cultivate a positive and magnetic\nculture find they have created ambassadors on the outside. - [Yvette\nKennedy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yvette-kennedy-2741001),[\nExplorance](https://explorance.com/)\n\n**14\\. Share Employee Videos**\n\nStart by sharing short videos on your social channels. Videos should include\ntestimonials of current employees and what they love about their job. Even\ncompanies with little to no budget for employer branding can see fast results\nwith this method. Employees who are featured will also share on their social\nchannels and will influence their own networks to seek out your employment\nopportunities. - [Shelli Nelson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shellinelson),[\nMadison Industries](http://www.madison.net/)\n\n**15\\. Know Your Company's Reputation**\n\nHR leaders need to understand the pulse in the organization and how both\ncurrent and former employees view the organization. From there, HR leaders can\npartner with other company leaders to help improve or promote the view on the\nemployer brand by its unique cultural characteristics and demonstrate how your\norganization is a good employer. - [Sherry\nMartin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherrymartin26),[ Colorado Department of\nHuman Services (CDHS)](https://www.colorado.gov/cdhs)\n\n[![Forbes Human Resources Council](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/assets/images/avatars/blog-4332_400_ca7d92be72a8ef01cadb837abca3e5f4.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/\n\"Photo of Forbes Human Resources Council\")\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only, fee-based organization\nfor senior-level human resources executives across all industries.

potentially out for summer, the practical challenges of\nmanaging a remote workforce and supporting managers to deal with their own\nteams have just got even more difficult. From** **dropped video calls to\nmanaging expectations around working with children at home, how can HR\nprofessionals cope?**\n\nFor HR departments across the UK, Monday (23 March) will have been one of the\nbusiest and most testing days they have experienced in a long time. On top of\nthe existing impact the coronavirus has had on policies, staff sickness and\nworkforce redeployment, school closures mean that hundreds of working parents\nare now juggling remote work with virtual classrooms and breaking up arguments\nover the TV remote.\n\n## Coronavirus: policies and procedures\n\n**[Coronavirus: Temporary changes to workplace policies and\nprocedures](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/policies-and-documents/coronavirus-\ncovid-19-temporary-changes-to-workplace-policies-and-\nprocedures/164997/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\n**[Homeworking policy](https://www.xperthr.co.uk/policies-and-\ndocuments/homeworking-\npolicy/50513/?cmpid=ILC|PROF|HRPIO-2013-110-XHR_free_content_links|ptod_article&sfid=701w0000000uNMa)**\n\nMost employers will have advised widespread [working from home from Monday\nlast week](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/start-working-from-home-says-\npm/), when prime minister Boris Johnson stepped up the UK\u2019s response to the\nspread of the virus by advising against all unnecessary travel. Commuter train\nand tube services have been cut as office workers set themselves up at home.\n\nAs work shifted online, tools such as Slack and Microsoft Teams took the\nstrain; both have reported spikes in the number of new users \u2013 Slack\u2019s group\nmessaging tool has gained 40% more users since February than it typically has\nin a whole quarter, according to its CEO. Microsoft said the number of people\nusing Teams on a single day last week was 44 million, compared with a usual\npeak of around 20 million.\n\nBut as workers replaced face-to-face meetings with video calls and email and\nfile-sharing applications became busier than usual, users complained of home\nbroadband systems unable to cope and unreliable connections leading to\nfrustration. Vodafone and TalkTalk reported a 30% and 20% rise, respectively,\nin internet traffic last week as homeworkers moved online and others binged on\nTV streaming services while stuck at home.\n\n## Emergency provisions\n\nFor many HR professionals, simply getting to grips with some of the practical\nadjustments of managing teams remotely \u2013 whether their own or supporting\nmanagers, has been a challenge. \u201cWe\u2019ve always considered that we have really\nstrong business continuity plans in place \u2013 all of our employees have the\nhardware and software they need to work away from the office, and many work\nremotely on a regular basis,\u201d says Claire Williams, director of people and\nservices at software company CIPHR.\n\n\u201cSo it's been surprising how many things we've had to make emergency\nprovisions for. There\u2019s just a really big difference between working from home\nfrom time-to-time, and working at home full-time.\u201d One recurring issue has\nbeen employees\u2019 office set-up at home, she adds. \u201cDesk equipment is one\nexample \u2013 more of our people are realising that their home setup is far from\nideal, and they need additional monitors, keyboards, mice etc. Some have even\ncome into the office and taken their desk chairs home with them.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, [Acas issued guidance](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/acas-\nworking-from-home-guidance/) for employers about managing remote workers. It\nurged organisations to be \u201cpractical, flexible and sensitive\u201d to employees\u2019\nsituations, and to put any agreed working arrangements into writing so\neveryone is clear about what is expected. Managers should also consider which\ntasks can be done from home but not fall into the assumption that certain\nroles cannot be performed remotely.\n\nThe CIPD echoed this advice. Peter Cheese, chief executive, called for\nemployers to \u201cmake allowances [for the school closure] and take a flexible\napproach, especially for people with younger children who will inevitably need\nmore care.\n\n\u201cThere may be limited space and limited equipment to manage both parents and\nchildren working from home each day. There will be disruption,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cEmployees should speak to their line managers and HR teams to understand how\nthey can best balance family and work commitments, especially as this stands\nto be for a prolonged period of time.\u201d\n\n## Work and childcare\n\nWilliams says she has already had a lot of queries from staff about how they\nshould juggle working from home with childcare. \u201cWe have policies in place for\nbusiness as usual, but this is potentially a long-term situation that we\u2019ll\nneed to adjust to,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo we've had to kind of think about it in a far\nmore flexible way. Our approach has been: we\u2019ll be asking for a lot of\ngoodwill from our staff over the next few months, so wherever we have the\nopportunity to show that flexibility and goodwill back to them in return, we\nhave to do that. We\u2019re taking a pragmatic approach, offering employees the\noption to shift their working hours, or break up their hours, for example.\u201d\n\nBut where do employers stand legally when it comes to balancing someone\u2019s work\ncommitments with looking after children? It is not unusual for employers, for\nexample, to demand that working from home days should not be used as a proxy\nfor childcare for preschool children. Does this still hold true? When Johnson\nannounced stricter lockdown measures yesterday, staff were told they could\nonly travel to their usual place of work \"only where work absolutely cannot be\ndone from home\".\n\nBeverley Sunderland, managing director of Crossland Employment Solicitors,\nexplains that in more usual business times, an employee\u2019s only real\nentitlement here would be to take emergency time off unpaid. But these are, of\ncourse, not typical circumstances. \u201cEmployers in the short-term are being much\nmore relaxed about it,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re happy if joint parents timeshare\n[one works in the morning, the other in the afternoon, for example], and make\nthings up in the evening. They\u2019re fine as long as you\u2019re available if a client\nhas an urgent question and keep them posted.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re taking a pragmatic approach, offering employees the option to shift\ntheir working hours, or break up their hours, for example\u201d \u2013 Claire Williams,\nCIPHR\n\nThey also need to be mindful of expectations, she adds. Asking someone to take\nemergency time off for dependants \u201cwhile they sort out other childcare\noptions\u201d \u2013 something they might have done under different circumstances \u2013 is\nnot really an option at the moment because doing so would go against\ngovernment social distancing guidelines.\n\n## Getting the balance right\n\nManagers are also having to get to grips with new ways of communicating with\nemployees they typically see every day. Hannah Prince, a business psychologist\nat Insights Learning and Development, says it\u2019s important not to overwhelm\nemployees by barraging them with constant communications via different\nchannels.\n\n\u201cOne of the best ways to manage this is to generate a few options and vote on\nit as a team. Giving your team members a voice and empowering them to shape\ndecisions is an important part of creating a healthy team, particularly during\ndifficult times,\u201d she advises. \u201cHave open conversations with each colleague,\nco-create strategies and flex these strategies as much as needed. You know\nyour industry, work and team best so consider what will be best for your own\nbusiness, team and location. What tools do you currently use, what could you\npotentially use and what would be the best fit?\u201d\n\nPrince urges managers to consider alternatives to email, as inboxes will\noverflow and meanings can be lost in translation. \u201cOnly communicating via\nemail is not always the most effective way to work, as sentiments can easily\nbe misconstrued and it\u2019s not the quickest way to share ideas in real time,\u201d\nshe says. \u201cAlso remember that individuals are entitled to say, \u2018not right\nnow.\u2019 Employees should be able to set their status to \u2018do not disturb\u2019 or\n\u2018busy\u2019 so they can be contacted when they\u2019re available, rather than be\nexpected to stay switched on all the time.\u201d\n\nDan Tesjnak, head of EMEA at learning platform company Degreed, says employees\nhave been given the option to order additional tech facilities such as screens\nso they can build an environment that suits them at home. But it's not just\nabout the technical support, he explains: \"As Degreed\u2019s executive team we have\nbeen mindful to continually communicate and ensure that employee\u2019s mental and\nphysical health is the number one priority. Plus our team shares regular\nupdates on the pandemic, our company\u2019s evolving situation, how employees\nshould be dealing with it and the ways Degreed is exploring to support local\ncommunities and charities through the crisis.\"\n\n## Making the transition\n\nGamiel Yafai, founder of D&I consultancy and coaching company Diversity\nMarketplace, says the transition to doing absolutely everything online has\nbeen an exhausting one. \u201cI\u2019m used to using Skype and Teams perhaps once a\nmonth and now it\u2019s constant; one day last week I did video calls back to back\nfor five-and-a-half hours,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I work face-to-face with people I\nspace things out or there is time in between to get from A to B. I\u2019m now\nbooking in time between appointments \u2013 as a coach it\u2019s important that clients\u2019\nconversations don\u2019t start to merge into one another.\u201d\n\nAn advantage of getting used to widespread remote working has been learning\nnew things about the platforms he uses, adds Yafai. \u201cYou can do break-outs,\npair people up, take notes \u2013 I\u2019m lucky I have a network of people I can ask\nquestions or share my learnings with. This has never been so important.\u201d And\nwhile virtual coaching may feel like certain things would get lost in\ntranslation, this has not been the case, he says: \u201cSometimes it\u2019s more\nempowering to [coach virtually] as people don\u2019t feel as though they have to\nhide themselves. You can still get to know each other and ask questions.\u201d\n\nDay-to-day HR activities such as onboarding have also had to change radically.\n\u201cWhere we can, we are onboarding people remotely, and thinking a bit\ncreatively about how we make them feel part of the team,\u201d says Williams at\nCIPHR. \u201cBut for others \u2013 where the roles require a lot of face-to-face\ntraining or job shadowing, which we can\u2019t do while social distancing applies \u2013\nwe\u2019re having to postpone start dates.\u201d Anyone who is already in the interview\nprocess for a role will continue to go through that process, but remotely.\n\nFor some roles, interviews have been deferred altogether. \u201cThe message to\ncandidates in those situations is, \u2018we really would like to continue this\nconversation but because we\u2019re not able to onboard right now, can we just stay\nin touch?\u2019,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo we\u2019re working on building up a really strong talent\npool that means we can kick-start hiring again at the appropriate point.\u201d\n\n## Setting out a structure\n\nEstablishing a loose daily routine among teams can help, both in practical\nterms of getting things done and giving employees some structure at a time\nwhen anxiety levels will be peaking. A daily stand-up meeting, for example, is\nuseful for teams to see where they are up to, so tasks aren\u2019t missed or\nreplicated.\n\n\u201cRemote working can lead to employees feeling the need to justify themselves\nor prove their worth by slipping into an unhealthy pattern of long hours\u201d -\nHannah Prince, Insights Learning and Development\n\n\u201cShort core team meetings can help identify progress on projects, plus any\nblockers and solutions. Blockers may now be things related to our current\nworld of uncertainty with coronavirus, so it\u2019s important to raise issues as\nsoon as they come up and not dwell on them,\u201d Prince adds. Don\u2019t forget to book\nin some \u2018water-cooler\u2019 time where colleagues can chat to each other openly\nwithout an agenda, she adds, perhaps adding a message board or non-work stream\non a tool such as Slack.\n\nA sense of feeling together even though the team is not together could be one\nway to beat a sense of isolation many workers may feel from being stuck at\nhome. STATS. Prince says the \u201csimplest and most effective thing to do is be\ndirect and ask\u201d employees about how they are feeling, as different people will\nhandle the new situation in different ways. \u201cRemote working can lead to\nemployees feeling the need to justify themselves or prove their worth by\nslipping into an unhealthy pattern of long hours,\u201d she says.\n\nWilliams says that CIPHR\u2019s employees have welcomed social interaction. \u201cWe\u2019ve\nbeen doing regular formal communications through email, Yammer, and weekly\nteam briefings, but it\u2019s the informal communications that people are saying\nthey need to help them feel less isolated and build morale,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve\nseen people taking the initiative \u2013 one of our employees started a group chat\nin Microsoft Teams (which a third of the company has joined), we\u2019re making\nmore use of a mobile engagement app called Totem, and from next week we\u2019ll be\ndoing a Friday company quiz. There\u2019s still more to do, and it\u2019s something that\nwe\u2019ll be continuing to work on.\u201d\n\nFriday quizzes and coffee chats aside, there may well also be a contingent of\nemployees who are resistant to their new working circumstances. Alex\nEfthymiades, founder of mediation consultancy Consensio, argues that it\u2019s\nimportant to practise empathy \u2013 the knock-on effect of the coronavirus will\nhave touched every single employee in some way. \u201cChange is really hard for\nmost of us so we need to allow people time to adjust. And this is multiple\nchanges all happening at once \u2013 people are suddenly working from home, with a\npartner and/or kids \u2013 there are so many adjustments all at once,\u201d she says.\n\u201cCoupled with that is the fear of not knowing when this will end, or whether\ntheir work is even secure.\u201d\n\nWhere managers feel as though there are delicate conversations to be had,\nthese should not be done over email or text message, she adds. \u201cIf you are\ngoing to speak to someone about a difficult issue do it over telephone or\nsomething like Zoom. Consider whether it\u2019s the right time now, too \u2013 for many\npeople this is the first real week of working from home, many with children.\nWait until they have settled into that reality.\u201d\n\nWith new developments to come to terms with every day, HR teams face\nunprecedented challenges in the weeks and months ahead. But Efthymiades is\nhopeful that the way organisations manage the coronavirus crisis will lead to\npositive changes, too. \u201cThings that might have led to a conflict or concern a\nfew weeks ago now don\u2019t seem like priorities, and people\u2019s perspectives are\nchanging,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see more empathy as we come out of this.\u201d\n\n[Previous

Stevenson ](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/contributor/mason-\nstevenson)  \n__01/08/2020\n\n* * *\n\n![The Onboarding Process and Its Link to Retention_man working on laptop while\nwoman takes\nnotes](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/the_onboarding_process_and_its_link_to_retention_man_working_on_laptop_while_woman_takes_notes.jpg)\n\nNever underestimate the power a fantastic onboarding process.  It could cost\nthe company later. In fact, if the onboarding strategy is strong, it can keep\nthe company's front door from transforming into a revolving door.\n\nIn other words, a powerful onboarding process translates to the retention of\ntalent down the road.  According to [research by\nGlassdoor](https://b2b-assets.glassdoor.com/the-true-cost-of-a-bad-hire.pdf),\norganizations with a strong onboarding process can improve the retention of\nnew hires by 82 percent.  Additionally, productivity sees a boost in\nimprovement of more than 70 percent!\n\n# Onboarding and Retention\n\n## Strategy Linkages\n\nTo some extent - [onboarding](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/news/onboarding-success-in-4-steps-1) and\n[retention](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/articles/retention-talent-management-pillars-part-iv) have been\nconsidered separate strategies.  And that's still predominantly the case,\nhowever, HR has begun to see the linkages between the two.  To be more\nspecific, onboarding can be, at least in some way, considered a retention\nstrategy.\n\nThink about it for a moment.\n\nThe onboarding process is one of the first impressions an employee will have\nof the company as a new hire.  Sure, he or she has gone through the interview\nprocess, spoken to HR professionals and even managers, but the person's\ninteraction with the company up to this point has been mainly external.  As a\nnew hire, she or he will gain access to the company's \"world\" - being able to\nsign into the company intranet for the first time and even meet new co-workers\n-- among other things.  The company will benefit from these positive\nexperiences and could, conversely, suffer from negative ones.  Digitate says\nemployees having a negative [onboarding\nexperience](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/articles/employee-experience-the-business-case) are twice as likely\nto look for another job.\n\n**FACTOID**\n\n88% of organizations don't onboard well.\n\nGallup  \n  \n---  \n  \n\n\nA bad first impression can flavor not only the rest of the onboarding process,\nbut also the hew hire's later interactions with the company.  Some examples\nmight include:\n\n  * A negative impact on the building of the [psychological contract](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/articles/psychological-contract-the-pros-and-cons) between the employee and the employer\n  * A lack of engagement from the new employee\n  * An impact on productivity\n  * An impediment when it comes to connecting with other co-workers and the company culture\n\n### Length of the Process\n\nWhen I first entered the workforce after graduating college and landed my\nfirst job, the onboarding process was a blur.  Within a few days, I was\nexpected to be up and running without a real opportunity to acclimate to my\nnew environment.  It was not a good experience and seven months later, I moved\non to another organization.  That's not the case for everyone, but it does\narticulate a very important point:  onboarding should not be a one week\nprocess.  According to HCI, a week is not a lot of time for a new hire to get\nsituated and ready to be productive.  In general, a strong onboarding program\nwill last, at minimum, 90 days.  In some instance, the program will run for a\nfull year.  It's important to for a new hire to receive as much support as\nnecessary.  Otherwise, he or she will feel overwhelmed and under prepared for\nthe tasks they have to complete each day.\n\n#### The State of HR\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/state_of_hr_cover_small.jpg)\n\nThe State of HR is in transition.  The days of being merely transactional are\nextinct and the evolution of the strategic HR department is underway.  So,\nwhat shape will the future take?  Where will the focus lie in order to achieve\nsuccess?  Find out in our latest report:  The State of HR.\n\n[Learn More](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/reports/the-state-of-\nhr/?utm_source=Inline_Ad&utm_medium=Portal&utm_campaign=HRIQ-20-State%20of%20HR%20Report&utm_term=&utm_content=&disc=&extTreatId=7503447)\n\n### Onboarding Best Practices\n\nWith that in mind, there are four essential steps in the onboarding process\nthat help employees be successful.\n\n  1. _Perform all Logical tasks before the employee 's actual start date_. Think paperwork here.  If it's done before the new hire's first day, it leaves more time for the employee to meet with managers and co-workers.\n  2. _First day welcomes_. Anything HR can do to make the employee feel part of the team is critical.  It could be a card welcoming the new employee or even a small mixer-like event.\n  3. _Make connections_. This focuses solely on creating more opportunities for the new hire to connect with co-workers.\n  4. Conduct regular check-ins and expectations. Do not abandon the employee.  Follow up and make sure he or she has everything they need.  Otherwise, you have an employee that feels lost and without the appropriate tools and/or knowledge to perform well.\n\nFor more information and ideas, [click\nhere](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/articles/onboarding-essentials).\n\n### Cross-boarding\n\nSo far, we've looked the linkage between onboarding and retention from the new\nhire angle, but what about from the angle of the internal employee?  This is\noften referred to as cross-boarding.  In fact, HCI reports 81 percent of\norganizations believe cross-boarding is just as important as new hire\nonboarding.  Despite that, only 27 percent of companies say they actually\npractice this process.  Now, internal hires won't need the same type of time\nand attention as a new hire - at least from the standpoint of needing\ninformation about the company.  However, internal hires or promoted employees\ndo need time to get to know their new team.  Additionally, they will require\nsome training to get used to their new job responsibilities.\n\n## In summation\n\nOnboarding can offer a plethora of rewards for companies with HR professionals\nor human resources team that knows what it is doing from an onboarding\nstandpoint.  Retention is definitely one of those rewards.  Given the current\nwork climate, specifically the difficulty of finding new talent for the\norganization or finding talent with the right skills for the job openings\navailable, it is no wonder companies want to keep those high potential and\nsuper productive employees on the payroll.  When it comes to retention, the\nonboarding strategy can be the most powerful and complimentary tool in the HR\nprofessional's arsenal.\n\n\n\n**_Want more content faster?

Lingard Cezanne HR\n\n**_Writes Sue Lingard, Director at_[ _Cezanne HR_](https://cezannehr.com/)**\n\nVolunteers are the lifeblood of many UK charities and not-for-profits.\nAccording to the Community Life Survey, volunteers donate over 2 billion hours\nof their time each year \u2013 equivalent to 1.25 full-time employees.\n\nHowever, research suggests that volunteer engagement is harder to build, and\nloyalty harder to retain. That presents both a challenge and an opportunity.\nThe challenge is to find new and better ways to onboard and engage your\nvolunteers \u2013 the opportunity is to break down the barriers that are getting in\nthe way so your whole organisation can be more effective.\n\n******1\\. Paperwork**\n\nFor most not-for-profits, taking on volunteers has more than its fair share of\nassociated \u2013 and often essential \u2013 paperwork. It\u2019s critical that this doesn\u2019t\nbog down either yourselves or your volunteers. Everyone hates being asked to\nprovide the same information in triplicate, or wasting hours chasing down\nmissing forms \u2013 or turning up on the first day to be told you can\u2019t actually\ndo anything because an essential check has not been completed.\n\nMapping out your new joiner process can help minimise the risk. What\ninformation do you need to collect for each volunteer, how do you get it and\nwho needs to be involved? Once you\u2019ve got to grips with the process, finding\nonboarding tools that can help you streamline the collection of the relevant\ndocuments and data are worth their weight in gold.\n\n**2\\. Training**\n\nProviding effective, timely and appropriate training will make the difference\nbetween a frustrated volunteer and one that\u2019s more productive and more\nsatisfied. For over-stretched charities, there is a temptation to devolve\ntraining responsibility to local staff. That can work, but it can also\nbackfire. Not everyone is a natural mentor, and local staff may not have the\ntime, or experience, to provide an appropriate level of support.\n\nA number of organisations provide online training that doesn\u2019t cost an arm and\na leg and can help volunteers get up to speed in their own time.\n\n**3\\. Commitment**\n\nLife often gets in the way of good intentions, so building volunteer\ncommitment from the get-go is critical. A good onboarding process that builds\nemotional connections \u2013 and makes every individual volunteer feel part of a\nteam \u2013 can make all the difference.\n\nQualitive research by The Involve Foundation found that participation was\nfostered by the availability of places to meet, collaborate and share\nthinking.\n\nLook for volunteers that are great at making connections, and buddy them up\nwith the new starters. Mix in permanent staff and create opportunities for\nthem to meet up \u2013 either face to face or online. Having a forum where they can\nshare ideas, or just keep in touch means that even if they don\u2019t see each\nother face to face, they can still feel part of your community.\n\n**4\\. Feedback**\n\nEveryone wants to know they are making a difference and volunteers \u2013 who are\ngiving up their time for free \u2013 deserve it more than most. Finding the time to\nmake this happen can be challenging \u2013 it\u2019s too easy for important events, or\nopportunities, to get overlooked. HR systems can act as a virtual assistant,\ngiving a nudge, for example, when an anniversary is coming up, or providing a\nforum where staff can give each other kudos.\n\nPerformance check-ins, where volunteers have the chance to share experiences\nand ask for guidance, can be invaluable, too. They provide the opportunity for\nvolunteers to have their voices heard and, supported by the right technology,\ncan be easy to set up and manage.\n\n******5\\. Time**\n\nTime is the most important resource you and your volunteers have. So, finding\nways to save it \u2013 to cut down on manual administration and work smarter\ntogether \u2013 will have an immediate impact on the work you do.\n\nDigital HR solutions that centralise data, automate manual processes and\nprovide easy but secure self-service access, remove unnecessary admin\noverheads and help processes flow more smoothly.\n\nAnd, while the charity sector has had a reputation for lagging behind in the\nadoption of digital tools, our experience suggests that when it comes to HR,\nthey are catching up fast.\n\nThe availability of sophisticated but cost-effective Cloud-first HR systems is\nproviding HR teams with the opportunity to revolutionise their back-office\nprocesses \u2013 and engage with employees and volunteers in a way that is much\nmore rewarding and satisfying for everyone involved.\n\n__\n\nShare\n\n[ __

The simple reason is\ntoday businesses want to be associated with excellence and efficiency, whether\nit is its processes or products. Notwithstanding the meaning given to each of\nthese practices by a business, all these initiatives involve employees in the\norganisation and this is why communication remains a key factor in any\norganisation.\n\nThis article will highlight the importance of communicating and mentoring\nemployees at the point of joining an organisation.Despite the benefits\nassociated with a well-planned orientation programme, there appears to be a\nstartling level of confusion between an employee onboarding programme and\nemployee orientation. Most organisations do not seem to have a clear\ndistinction between these two and often the words tend to be used\ninterchangeably.\n\nThe problem extends beyond just semantics in that it could mean the difference\nbetween fully integrating a new employee into an organisation to becoming a\nproductive team player. Yet the two processes are equally important because\nlack of a proper induction programme leaves employers lacking the full buy-in\nfrom the new appointees. It is therefore critical that all organisations get\nthe distinction between employee orientation and onboarding right so that they\ncreate appropriate programmes for each role.\n\nEmployee orientation serves as the first phase of an employee onboarding\nprogramme as it seeks to induct the new employees to organisational policies,\nprocedures and the new workplace. This process must be concluded within the\nfirst few days after someone has been hired. It should be done over a short\nperiod but not so comprehensively to talk about performance expectations and\nevaluation parameters but rather talk about working breaks, benefits and other\nhousekeeping matters.\n\nEmployee orientation therefore becomes a critical talent management process\naimed at introducing a new employee to their jobs, co-workers and cultures of\nan organisation.\n\nSuccessful employee orientation programmes help new employees to become\nfamiliar with the organisational environment as well as helping them to\nunderstand their responsibilities. If properly done employee orientation\ncontributes to job satisfaction, moral building and job enrichment. Through\nthis process an employee is spurred to become the best employee possible while\nconvincing them that they made the correct decision to joining an\norganisation.\n\nIn addition, employee orientation has a strategic role of converting a great\nstarter into a stellar employee. Using orientation programmes an employee\nshould have all the requirements spelt out as well as painting a picture of\ntheir work contribution to the entire organisation.\n\nEmployee onboarding programme has a broader and more comprehensive reach than\nemployee orientation. The strategic role of this process is to reduce the\nperiod between hiring a new employee and the time they reach to maximum\nexpected level of performance. This is a critical process on helping the\nemployee to settle and focus on their performance. A well-thought-out\nonboarding programme will take time and needs a lot of commitment but it does\nindeed yield a lot of returns.\n\nUnlike orientation onboarding, a newcomer must be for at least half a year.\nHow an employee handles experiences during the formative months at the new\nworkplace is very crucial to attaining high retention in the long run. It is\nthrough onboarding programmes that an employer can develop successful and\ncommitted relationships that are beneficial to both the employee and the\norganisation.\n\nThe programme has a lot of individual mentoring and HR support. Such a process\nhas proven to be more successful as compared to the sink or swim approach that\nother organisations adopt. Here is a 4Cs guide when developing and\nimplementing an onboarding programme.\n\nCompliance where the employee learns the basic legal and policy issues and\nregulations for their professional practice  \nClarification \u2014 making sure the new employee understands the requirements of\ntheir job, the expectations and key deliverables of their jobs  \nCulture is the broadest category which involves equipping the employee with\nthe established organisational norms which include both the formal and\ninformal routines\n\nConnections are a vital ingredient of the onboard processes that connects all\nelements. The interpersonal relationships as well as information networks\nneeded by the new employee if they are to thrive in their new role.\n\nThese four pedals should be used by organisations to stand a better chance of\nreaping the benefits of an onboarding process. An important element offered by\nan onboarding process unlike orientation is social integration. This is when a\nnew employee gets the acceptance of their co-workers which if done well leads\nto successful adjustment marked by high quality relationships. Finally, the\nknowledge culture exhibited after this process will show the level of fit\nbetween the employee and organisational culture.\n\nJinda is the managing consultant of PROSERVE Consulting

for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n## **Is Your Onboarding Strategy on Point?**\n\nHaving a stellar [onboarding\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/) is critical to\n[employee retention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/).\nAccording to research by Jobvite, a significant portion of your new hires is\nlikely to quit in just 90 days after joining their role. This makes the\nonboarding experience a key differentiator in how they perceive a company,\nengage with the job, and stay involved (or not) with your business objectives.\n\nAnd here are a few more metrics that drive home the need for a smart\nonboarding experience strategy. These findings are from a SilkRoad Technology\nreport titled U.S. Trends and Applications in **[Employee\nOnboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/)** , published earlier in 2019:\n\n  * 65% of employees say that an onboarding program helps to prepare for the next step in their career trajectory\n  * Organizations with a clearly outlined [onboarding process](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) enjoy 82% higher new employee retention, as well as a 70% uptick in productivity\n  * The average recruit must go through 54 different activities as part of their onboarding experience, suggesting a marked degree of complexity\n\n  \nAs we approach 2020, it is time to rethink the onboarding experience with a\nfocus on candidate engagement and long-term retention. Remember, the lessons\nlearned and the impressions made during these early days will be critical in\ndetermining whether top talent decides to stay on with your company.\n\nAn intelligent onboarding experience strategy, informed by a set of key best\npractices, will help you maximize each new resource that becomes part of your\nworkforce. Let\u2019s look at how to improve the onboarding experience in 2020,\nwith trends and examples to illustrate the way forward.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n## **How to Improve the Onboarding Experience: 10 Strategies to Remember**\n\nThe world\u2019s leading companies are now squarely focused on delivering the best\nonboarding experiences possible. Interestingly, this goes beyond the offer\nacceptance and joining stage \u2013 from the moment a candidate seriously considers\nyour organization as a potential employer, you should focus on having a\n**[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/)** strategy that\ntranslates into a stellar onboarding experience. Here are ten tips to help\nimprove your onboarding experience in 2020, minimizing early [attrition\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nattrition-complete-guide/)and disengagement risks.\n\n![10 ways to improve the onboarding experience for your new\nhires](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. 10 ways to improve the onboarding experience for your new hires**\n\n### **1\\. Make learning & development (L&D;) central to the onboarding\nexperience **\n\n  \nOnboarding is all about equipping a recruit to bring their very best to a\nworkplace from day one. If they spend weeks or even months familiarizing\nthemselves with your company, exploring self-service capabilities, and\nfiguring out how to complete routine tasks, they are being far less productive\nthan they can be.\n\nThis is why L&D; is vital for an enriched onboarding experience \u2013 learning\nmodules on essential software, short one-on-one sessions with a line manager,\nand pre-recorded videos on company values/ethics can go a long way in helping\nrecruits overcome their teething troubles.\n\nFor example, U.S.-based Hormel Foods Corporation adopted this strategy to\nredesign onboarding experiences in 2019. It deployed a gamified platform\ncalled Discovery Map\u00ae to allow new hires to learn information about the\ncompany quickly. This earned them the Silver Stevie Award in the Achievement\nin New Employee Onboarding category in 2019 as one of the best onboarding\nexperiences.\n\n### **2\\. Find innovative ways to inspire collaboration**\n\n  \nThere\u2019s no way around it. Collaboration is the cornerstone of engagement, and\nby inspiring recruits to collaborate with the workforce from day one, you can\nsubstantially improve the onboarding experience. There are many ways to do\nthis. For example, by scheduling an \"Onboarding Day\" every month/two months\ndepending on the size of your company, you can urge recruits to talk, share\ninsights, and resolve any concerns they may have about their future workplace.\n\nFor single-recruit onboarding experiences, you can invite participation from\nvarious stakeholders across the company, including team leads, vertical heads,\nand even C-level executives. Problem-solving exercises, quizzes, and\nquestionnaires are a great way to embed collaboration into your onboarding\nexperience.\n\nOne of the best onboarding experiences that leverages this collaborative model\nis practiced by Pinterest. The company\u2019s Knit SF onboarding strategy follows\nthe principles of knitting \u2013 using the term to refer to the collaboration of\npeople across the organization during the onboarding process. Activities like\npeer-to-peer icebreakers, candid chats with cross-disciplinary team leaders,\nand joining the company\u2019s Slack thread fall under this Knit SF framework. New\nhires are taken through all the departments of the organization to understand\nhow each function.\n\nIt also helps that despite having offices across the world, all new hires at\nPinterest begin their onboarding experience at the San Francisco headquarters.\n\n**Also Read:** **[10 Employee Onboarding Checklist Items You Can't Afford to\nMiss](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/employee-\nonboarding-checklist/)**\n\n### **3\\. Drive hiring managers to take greater ownership of the onboarding\nprocess**\n\n  \nBecause the onboarding experience involves multiple stakeholders across the\ncompany, there\u2019s always the risk that hiring managers may overlook a few key\ndetails. This challenge is compounded by the fact that onboarding is only one\ncomponent of a hiring manager's daily itinerary.\n\nAn excellent way to address this is by creating **[onboarding\nchecklists](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/employee-onboarding-checklist/)** that clearly lay out all the\nsteps required to improve the onboarding experience. Organizational leaders\ncan work together with the internal marketing team to schedule email updates\nthat inform and inspire hiring managers to take ownership.\n\nFor example, Google sends a manager \u201cjust in time\u201d onboarding checklists to\nassist with the onboarding experience. The company shares this list only 24\nhours before the recruit\u2019s arrival, ensuring a sense of immediacy and urgency.\nSome of these tasks on this list include having discussions with the new hire,\nassigning them a peer buddy, building a social network, setting up regular\ncheck-ins, and having transparent dialogues to identify how they feel about\nworking there.\n\nWith only one day to prepare, the manager is more likely to remember and focus\non each component. This small change to Google's onboarding experience\nstrategy improved results from onboarding by 25%.\n\n### **4\\. Integrate all the touchpoints on the employee onboarding journey**\n\n  \nAs mentioned, the typical employee must go through numerous activities and\nprotocols before they can complete the onboarding process. This can sometimes\nbe a fragmented experience, lowering the recruit's capability to remember and\nact on the information gained during onboarding. Integration of onboarding\ntouchpoints such as L&D;, admin, compliance, and workforce management could\nhelp to improve the onboarding experience significantly.\n\nFor example, instead of providing multiple hard copies for photographs for\ndocumentation, and then receiving an employee ID, the recruit can take a\nselfie or share a digital photo that\u2019s reused across various departments. Not\nonly does this dramatically cut down the onboarding timeline, but it also\nenhances the overall quality of experience.\n\nDell Boomi recognized the impact of this onboarding experience strategy after\nsurveying its employees last year. It found that 74% of the workforce didn\u2019t\nreceive a laptop on day one, and it took an average of 92 days before gaining\naccess to key applications and information.\n\nSo, the company developed an Onboarding Solution Accelerator that could\nresolve fragmentation in onboarding experiences by leveraging remote access,\nmobile competencies, and automation. Thanks to what is one of the best\nonboarding experiences we have seen so far, Dell saved 3.4 hours in admin\neffort per recruit and $5,600 in annual costs.\n\n### **5\\. Initiate the onboarding experience before the recruit steps into the\noffice**\n\n  \nEvery recruiter has undoubtedly come across this scenario: after a rigorous\nscreening process and negotiations, the offer is rolled out and accepted. But\nthe recruit changes their mind a few days before the joining date. This leads\nto massive sunk costs and overall inefficiency in your talent acquisition\npipeline.\n\nTo address this, it is crucial to extend the onboarding experience beyond the\noffice premises. By engaging with the recruit immediately after the offer\nacceptance, you can alleviate everyday worries (commute, career progressions,\ndiversity, etc.) and ensure that they do not look for greener pastures\nelsewhere.\n\nThat\u2019s why preboarding is now among the top onboarding experience strategies\nfor employers across the globe.\n\nWhen a high-tech electronics firm saw that an increasing number of recruits\nwere dropping off after receiving an offer, they started thinking about how to\nimprove the onboarding experience for their new hires.\n\nOne of the measures it took was designing a preboarding package that was\nmailed to the employee\u2019s home address. It included a company video,\ntestimonials by future colleagues, and detailed descriptions of the benefits\nthey could expect at the company.\n\nOnboarding experience best practices like this ensure that a recruit stays\nengaged with your organization until every formality has been completed.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Do You Measure These 5 Onboarding\nMetrics?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-five-onboarding-metrics/)\n\n### **6\\. Analyze the unique needs of varying recruit demographics**\n\n  \nThis is one of the key steps to improving your onboarding experience \u2013 not\nevery recruit will come with similar expectations, and the onboarding\nexperience cannot follow a one-size-fits-all model. There may be instances\nwhere engagement and community building should be at the forefront of the\nonboarding process.\n\nIn other cases, the experience should ideally pivot around the exchange and\ndissemination of information. Employers should conduct preboarding surveys to\ndetect these requirements early on, ensuring that the onboarding experience is\nin line with the recruit\u2019s individualized expectations.\n\nKPMG Belgium demonstrated a great example of this onboarding experience\nstrategy in action. The organization hires 170 graduates every year, in\naddition to 150 experienced hires. KPMG leveraged a combination of preboarding\npractices, content delivery systems, and process automation to improve the\nonboarding experience for these two unique categories.\n\nGiven that the cost of replacing a new graduate recruit could run up to 80% of\ntheir annual salary, you must try to deliver the best possible onboarding\nexperience to these young, ambitious professionals.\n\n### **7\\. Explore onboarding models for temporary and seasonal workers**\n\n  \nThe quality of the onboarding experience is as important for your temporary\nand seasonal workers as it is for employees joining the permanent company\npayroll. For sectors such as media and entertainment, retail, and healthcare,\nthe contingent workforce takes up a large part of their onboarding\ninvestments.\n\nA more efficient and optimized experience in this segment can help to deliver\nbetter results and save costs. It isn\u2019t enough to have temporary and seasonal\nworkers sign an offer and join the job \u2013 these are individuals who will be\nadvocates for your employer brand, who can effectively promote it to hire more\nworkers \u2013 even urgently if needed.\n\nA paper-based non-experience-focused onboarding journey brings down the\npossibility of a temporary worker choosing to work for you a second time\naround.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America (Denver) offers one of the best onboarding\nexperiences to its massive group of seasonal workers who join every year to\nstaff their summer camp. The company initially had a paper-driven, manual\nprocess where HR would go through every file to identify returning staff and\ncreate new folders for fresh recruits. This process took weeks to complete.\n\nBoy Scouts of America recently switched to an automated onboarding process\nthat doesn't require recruits to be physically present to furnish the\npaperwork. Owing to this new onboarding experience, the organization saved 48+\nhours in admin efforts and ensured a happier contingent workforce.\n\n### **8\\. Harmonize onboarding experiences across multiple locations**\n\n  \nProviding a consistent onboarding experience has always been a challenge for\nglobal/large-scale companies. Once the\n**[recruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-recruitment/)** process and offer rollout are over,\nregional offices follow their own practices until the recruit joins the\norganization. This could lead to a fragmented experience, dependent on the\ninterest and expertise level of local HR managers.\n\nTo achieve the same level of success across locations, it is essential to\nformulate a clear onboarding experience roadmap with strategic checks and\nbalances in place. This will also make it easier to introduce changes/upgrades\nto your onboarding model without requiring any major overhaul at each\nlocation.\n\nGlobal beverages company Bacardi provides a great example of this onboarding\nstrategy at work. Previously, Bacardi struggled with a different experience at\neach site, risking inefficient onboarding journeys at locations that were\nunderstaffed.\n\nTo improve the onboarding experience, the company now uses pulse surveys to\nshare and collect data over a 90-day welcome period. A buddy system and\nmandatory training are the other components of Bacardi\u2019s global onboarding\nprocess, which creates a seamless onboarding experience no matter where\nemployees join the company.\n\n### **9\\. Blend employee onboarding with continuous learning**\n\n  \nThe transition from the onboarding process (which can last from anywhere\nbetween two days and three months) to on-the-job practice, must be seamless.\nIt can be beneficial to measure employee skills at the time of joining and map\nhow it improves over time via onboarding as well as continuous learning.\n\nThe concept of **[strategic\nonboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/strategic-onboarding-plan-2019/)** involves the \u201ccontinuous\nonboarding\u201d of employees \u2013 a long-term strategy to keep employees engaged and\nrelevant for new positions within the company. It can even prepare them for\nleadership positions in the future. This can help you boost productivity and\nhelp employees reach their professional targets faster.\n\nO\u2019Shea Builders uses this onboarding tactic to raise the quality of talent in\nthe organization over time. At O\u2019Shea, onboarding and career development are\npart of the same process, guiding each employee through organizational and\ncareer goals. This is broken down into a two-part onboarding process, where\nthe first deals with new hire training and the second ask employees to define\nspecific development goals for themselves.\n\nThanks to customizable workflows and trackable progress, 83% of employees at\nO\u2019Shea Builders reported they were very satisfied with the onboarding and\ncareer development experience at the company.\n\n### **10\\. Factor in offboarding requirements right at the time of\nonboarding**\n\n  \nWith the average employment tenure gradually shrinking, your offboarding\nnumbers are likely to go up over the years. And the impressions made during\nthis crucial part of the employee journey will determine if they return to\nyour company, refer their acquaintances, and present your employer brand on\nsocial media.\n\nIt is advisable to take the data gathered during onboarding to frame an\nindividualized offboarding strategy. Apart from standard procedures in\ncompliance and admin areas, pulse surveys, one-on-one conversations, and a\ndiscussion on future opportunities are critical to offboarding.\n\nFor example, email automation startup Mailigen places offboarding at the heart\nof its employee-centric culture. The company realized that ineffective\noffboarding could result in sizeable costs, as rehiring an ex-employee is\noften better for business than looking for a new one. That\u2019s why Mailigen\ntreats the employee journey like any other relationship, where the\norganization must take care of first impressions, regular interactions, as\nwell as the closure to ensure the employer brand is maintained.\n\nThis is in addition to following the other onboarding experience strategies\nlisted above, including integration, collaboration, and an unwavering eye on\nengagement.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Top 10 Employee Onboarding Software for\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nemployee-onboarding-software/)\n\n## **Avoid These Pitfalls When Onboarding in 2020**\n\nThere are still a lot of wrinkles to be ironed out when it comes to improving\nonboarding experiences. Research by ServiceNow found that nearly a quarter of\nemployees receive no clear onboarding, and the company didn't note that it was\nan employee's first day in one out of ten cases.\n\nIf you\u2019re eager to learn how to improve onboarding experiences and deliver the\nbest onboarding experience to your 2020 recruits, make sure to avoid these\ncommon pitfalls:\n\n  * No alignment between onboarding and the reality of the job\n  * Giving the recruit full ownership for the first day, with zero handholding\n  * Setting performance benchmarks that become active without a transition period\n  * Information overload and exposure to a high number of technology platforms\n\n  \nSo these are among the top onboarding experience strategies that belong on\nyour radar as you look forward to a new year, marked by hiring success and\ncontinued engagement.

It was day four of stay-at-home orders from the\nCanadian government, in their response to the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe crisis unleashed by the novel coronavirus has been unprecedented. As\nbusinesses were ordered to shutdown indefinitely, HR folks' crisis-control\nmode switched to autopilot. The responsibility of keeping businesses open by\nimplementing sustainable work-from-home strategies fell squarely upon HR's\nshoulders. They had to create safe working practices for everyone across the\norganizational spectrum - from the most senior to frontline workers who\nweren't in a position to work from home. The playing field had suddenly been\nlevelled.\n\nUnder the crisis, HR had to get creative in assigning and redeploying talent\nto the most important teams. Inevitably, many HR leaders had to navigate\nsignificant employee layoffs.\n\nFortunately, social and physical distancing have become buzzwords in an era\nwhen technology has armed us with the tools needed to stay socially connected\nbut from a distance.\n\nCompassion was the call of the day. I have seen many of my colleagues and\nclients selflessly rising to the greater need with integrity. They have been\nquick, creative, resourceful and agile in their planning and execution. If one\ncompany had to downsize, they were proactively collaborating with\norganizations that needed more people. They were also supporting each other\nthrough virtual happy hours to connect, let off steam, and check on each\nother's wellbeing.\n\nWe have all done many desktop business continuity exercises, but this is real\nlife and beyond anyone's imagination. This situation has stretched all our\ncapabilities and resilience. Through these times, character will be developed\nand revealed.\n\n**Empathy required**  \nThe first call of duty was for all leaders to become CEOs - chief empathy\nofficers. The Centre for Creative Leadership defines empathy as \"the ability\nto experience and relate to the thoughts, emotions or experience of others.\nEmpathy is more than simple sympathy, which is being able to understand and\nsupport others with compassion or sensitivity.\" It's important not to assume\nwe understand what is going on with other people and remember that this crisis\nwill affect everyone differently.\n\nSome people will be concerned about being productive while working at home and\nkeeping their children entertained and educated. Others will be concerned\nabout vulnerable relatives who they may not be able to see because of\nquarantine restrictions. With the volume of layoffs, many will be concerned\nabout their financial position and future livelihood. Gig workers will be\nconcerned about their next project.\n\nThe heroes on the front line of retail and the health sector are in vulnerable\npositions. People are anxious about the news and troubled by self-isolation\nand loneliness. The leaders I coach have had to adapt how they lead in adverse\nand ambiguous times. They need to find moments to build awareness and connect\nwith people daily. As chief empathy officers, we will listen. We will be open.\nWe will connect. We will relate. We will help. We will get through this\ntogether.\n\n**Decluttering HR**  \nAs day-10 of COVID-19's self-isolation rolled around, I was reminded of a Josh\nBersin article and the need to reset HR. I'd set myself some ambitious (and\nsomewhat unrealistic) goals to declutter my life and that got me thinking: Is\nit time to \"Kondo\" HR?\n\nThrough a period of sustained economic growth, as businesses and as HR, we\nhave become hoarders. Driven by the demand to personalize HR and the employee\nexperience, we want our organizations to have the best of everything and we\nwant to please everyone. As a result, we have layered more and more complexity\non to processes and people that were already creaking at the seams. In a bid\nto be everything to everyone, HR has suffered an identity crisis in trying to\nfind new things that work.\n\nI have found myself balancing the demands of senior leaders and the\nconflicting needs of employees. There was never a shortage of good ideas - but\nthey would not always have the buy-in to make them sustainable, so we'd\nquickly move on to the next.\n\nCOVID-19 is forcing all of us pare down our lives and, in many ways, we are\ndiscovering pleasure in the simple things that we'd taken for granted. As a\nhabitual coffee-drinker, I have now developed more of an affinity for hot\nwater! Similarly, from a job perspective, this is HR's time to discard the\nfluffy nice-to-haves and rediscover the essentials of the employee experience.\n\nWhile hoarding's nemesis, Marie Kondo, is busy decluttering her own life, HR\nhas its moment to Kondo HR. Follow the same steps. Review every process, tool,\nintervention and policy and ask your people - does it bring you joy?\n\nWork is moving online, but the HR processes need to be revisited. Back in\nearly 2019, A relatively small [survey](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-\nworkplace/digital-employee-experience-still-not-viewed-as-business-critical/)\nshowed that only 20 per cent of companies could define what they meant by\n\"digital employee experience,\" suggesting even fewer of them actually had one.\nI don't imagine things have changed much in the intervening period.\nConsequently, many companies will be seeing cracks in their digital\nenvironments, post-COVID-19.\n\nI have three simple suggestions for HR leaders to create a digital employee\nexperience to ensure they keep their people engaged and productive while\nworking remotely.\n\n  * Step back and using real insights to review your employee experience through a digital lens. Identify where you have gaps and prioritise accordingly. It will be important to focus on the items that will have the biggest impact. Onboarding people virtually will be tricky, for example, but if you don't plan to do any significant hiring, why worry now?\n  * Leverage the digital solutions that you have already, before investing in any new toys. If you have an LMS, get it out to people. Create a competition around it to generate more users and more value. Everyone is jumping on Zoom (even uninvited people apparently!) but what other platforms do you have to keep your people engaged?\n  * Monitor the sentiment of your people regularly through check-ins and leader feedback. If you continue to identify issues, I suspect most of them can be fixed by leaders taking even more time to connect with their people. If (and only if!) it still isn't working, then a very specific technology solution might be required - and there are a lot of great ones out there.\n\nIn businesses, this is the time for us to hold the magnifying glass to\npractices that no longer work and replace them with simpler, more meaningful\nones. If HR has been looking for a time to heal workforce practices, to set\nthe recalibrate button, and to reconnect with their employees, this is your\ntime.\n\n### Latest stories\n\n  * [Building culture through the employee voice](/focus-areas/culture-and-engagement/building-culture-through-the-employee-voice/327997)\n  * [Two-fifths of millennials claim they work less compared to previous generations](/focus-areas/culture-and-engagement/two-fifths-of-millennials-claim-they-work-less-compared-to-previous-generations/328183)\n  * [After pandemic, Canadians keen to continue work-at-home options: poll](/focus-areas/compensation-and-benefits/after-pandemic-canadians-keen-to-continue-work-at-home-options-poll/328095)\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nThe Canadian HR Newswire is a FREE weekly newsletter that keeps you up to date\non news, opinion and analysis about the field of human resources.

And I\ndon\u2019t mean the use of technology in the recruitment process; I\u2019m talking about\nhow workplace technology as a whole affects the HR team\u2019s ability to meet day-\nto-day hiring and retention goals.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nIn some of the strongest findings from Workfront\u2019s most recent [State of Work\nsurvey](https://www.workfront.com/campaigns/state-of-work), 91% of knowledge\nworkers said they crave modern tech solutions, 88% said technology is an\nimportant part of the employee experience, and 84% said businesses today are\nmissing opportunities by not moving to more modern solutions.\n\nAs I thought about these results and how they map to my own experience, I\u2019ve\nidentified five core reasons an organization\u2019s approach to workplace tech can\nhave such a significant impact on the employee experience in the digital age.\n\n## **1\\. Work Today is Primarily a Digital Experience**\n\nIn the knowledge economy, our primary work relationship is no longer with our\nimmediate supervisor, our cubicle mates, or even our \u201coffice spouse.\u201d It\u2019s\nwith our computers. We interact with technology more than anything\u2014or\nanyone\u2014else by a wide margin.\n\nEven when we are collaborating with our fellow humans, this often happens via\na Zoom meeting, a Slack channel, or an integrated work management solution.\nIt's no longer enough for HR professionals to care only about how people\nexperience our in-office culture. We have to remember that our employees\u2019\noverall work experience also includes the technological tools people are using\nto do their work.\n\nIn just one example, expecting people to keep track of dozens of logins as\nthey jump from one digital interface to the next throughout the day is no\ndifferent from expecting them to navigate a physical obstacle course each\nmorning on their way to their desks.\n\nSo always consider: is your organization harnessing technology in a way that\nempowers people to do their best work? Or is your tech stack putting\nadditional barriers in their way? HR leaders don\u2019t always have a role in\nselecting or deploying workplace technology organization-wide, but the more\naware we are of technology\u2019s importance, the more influence we can exert, both\ndirectly and indirectly.\n\n## **2\\. Candidates Today Are Asking About Tech Stacks**\n\nThe technology your company uses to manage and produce work can greatly impact\nthe level of talent you\u2019re able to bring in the door. People want to work on\nmodern and emerging tech, especially in the IT sector, where there\u2019s a lot of\nhiring going on right now. Knowledge workers today want to advance their\nskills and have the opportunity to grow and build. Questions about the\ntechnology they\u2019ll be using if they join are key way candidates will screen\nyour organization for a good fit.\n\nNobody wants to be stuck working on dead-end technology or outdated tools that\nrequire them to do a lot of busywork.\n\nIn marketing as well, folks want to be able to get their work done well and\nefficiently, and they have a particular impatience with bureaucracy. They\u2019ll\noften ask about the company\u2019s tech stack during the recruiting process,\nknowing how important it is to have the right tools in order to achieve speed\nto market. The same holds true for finance, and HR, and every other\ndepartment. I also regularly see candidates accept positions because the\norganization uses tech they\u2019re eager to become proficient with, in order to\nfurther their personal and career goals.\n\nTo say technology factors into people\u2019s job-hunting decisions would be an\nunderstatement. Nobody takes a new job in hopes of doing lots of manual work;\nthey accept positions because they have ideas and expertise to offer. And\ntoday\u2019s candidates are savvier than ever about making sure prospective\nemployers are equipped with the technology that will empower them to bring\nthose ideas to fruition.\n\n## **3\\. Ease & Simplicity Are the New Expectations of Work**\n\nToday\u2019s workforce, especially digital natives, have been spoiled by Facebook,\nApple, Amazon, and Google. These tech behemoths have set the bar for\ninformation access, personalization, and connection\u2014and the modern worker\nexpects that ease of use everywhere they go.\n\nAgain, according to the State of Work report, 94% of respondents believe\nsearching for information at work should match the ease of Googling. And with\nthe average American spending more than [3.5 hours a\nday](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/6/21048116/tech-companies-time-well-\nspent-mobile-phone-usage-data) on our smartphones\u2014and the top 20% of users\nspending more than 4.5 hours a day glued to a screen\u2014it can be jarring when\nwork technology is \u201cdumb\u201d by comparison.\n\n## **4\\. Customization Matters More Than Ever**\n\nQuestions like, \u201cCan I work on an Apple or a Microsoft machine? How much\nflexibility will I get in the tools I use?\u201d are not uncommon in recruiting\ninterviews these days. Millennials, in particular, want to know how workplace\ntechnology can be customized to them individually vs. them being expected to\nuse a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nEverything from Netflix to social media profiles to gluten-free and vegan\ndiets can be customized and personalized infinitely, and there\u2019s a growing\nexpectation that the same will be true in the workplace. And today\u2019s top\nenterprise work-management solutions offer just that\u2014centralization of\ninformation and ease of use across the organization, along with the ability\nfor each user to have a customized experience.\n\nFor example, I have one individual on my team who uses the classic view in our\ninstance of Workfront, because that\u2019s what works for her. Her customized\nexperience has no impact on anyone else\u2019s individual experience because\nthere\u2019s no one right way to use it. Every member of the team can work when,\nwhere, and how they want while remaining seamlessly connected to everyone\nelse\u2014and the organization\u2019s most important initiatives.\n\n**Learn More:[2020 HR Predictions: Preparing HR Leaders for the Year\nAhead](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/2020-hr-predictions-\npreparing-hr-leaders-for-the-year-ahead/)**\n\n## **5\\. User Experience Matters Too**\n\nEmployees expect consistent user experiences across the entire software\nlandscape in the workplace. We expect different systems to have common traits.\nWe expect one login to work across the board, without having to upload our\nname, title, and photo in a dozen different apps. We expect to be able to\napply our knowledge of navigating one system to apply to another system. And\nas tech providers continue to offer integrations that bridge the seams between\ntheir interfaces, it\u2019s becoming easier than ever to deliver a stellar user\nexperience.\n\n## **Beyond Recruitment and Retention: HR\u2019s Starring Role in the Digital\nRevolution**\n\nIn the world of modern work, keeping up with new tech can feel like playing a\ngame of Whack-a-Mole: new options are popping up so fast it can make your head\nspin. HR leaders can (and should) tirelessly advocate for the importance of\nfolding in new solutions seamlessly, ensuring employees are trained to use\nworkplace tech (and use it well), encouraging opportunities for\nindividualization and personalization, and taking advantage of integrations\nfor consistent user experience. In these and other ways, HR professionals can\nplay a key role in helping their organizations realize the true promise of\ndigital transformation.\n\n**Learn More:[The Future of Work is About Helping People Get Work\nDone](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/the-\nfuture-of-work-is-about-helping-people-get-work-done/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2F5-reasons-workplace-technology-impacts-recruiting-retaining-\ntalent%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=5+Reasons+Workplace+Technology+Impacts+Recruiting+%26+Retaining+Talent\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=5+Reasons+Workplace+Technology+Impacts+Recruiting+%26+Retaining+Talent&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2F5-reasons-workplace-technology-impacts-recruiting-retaining-\ntalent%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2F5-reasons-workplace-technology-impacts-recruiting-retaining-\ntalent%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2F5-reasons-workplace-technology-impacts-recruiting-retaining-\ntalent%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=5 Reasons Workplace Technology Impacts\nRecruiting & Retaining\nTalent&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2F5-reasons-workplace-technology-impacts-recruiting-retaining-\ntalent%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

Hiring of fresh graduates is also part of the\ninitiative of most firms to rightsize their employee pyramid, which has become\nmid-level employee-heavy in recent years. Among IT firms, market leader Tata\nConsultancy Services (TCS) has added around 30,000 fresh graduates in this\nfinancial year. The company's management has said it will increase this number\nto 39,000 in the next financial year (FY21).\n\nWhile Infosys has made 18,000 offers this financial year, [Wipro\n](/topic/wipro)has said it will onboard around 20,000 fresh graduates.\n\n\"Joining of fresh graduates is likely to be staggered now as [companies\n](/companies)are expected to turn cautious due to likely demand slowdown. So,\nit can happen over batches,\" said Pareekh Jain, an IT outsourcing advisor and\nfounder of Pareekh Consulting.\n\n\"The real impact will be on hiring for next year (2021), which will depend on\nthe demand outlook amid spread of [coronavirus.](/about/what-is-coronavirus)\"\n\nThe IT industry is staring at a demand slowdown as many developed countries,\nincluding the US, have started to shut down establishments for imposing social\ndistancing to fight the spread of virus. As a result, the companies are\nalready witnessing delay in wining large deals, with reports suggesting that\ndeal signings worth around $3-4 billion have been deferred in this month\nalone.\n\nWhile fresher hiring hinges on the demand outlook, even job interviews for\nlateral hiring is getting delayed as companies are not able to conduct face-\nto-face interviews.\n\n\"The biggest issue is that none of the companies in India have complete\ne-onboarding process, so even after selection, candidates are not getting\nonboarded. As of now, most clients have deferred joining to the first week of\nApril,\" said Sunil Chemmankotil, Head (specialised staffing) at [TeamLease\n](/topic/teamlease)Digital.  \n  \n**Demand slowdown

Ineffective onboarding results in only 29% of engaged employees.\n\nWithin the first week, nearly half (49%) of employees with effective\nonboarding reported contributing to their team.\n\nThe effects of a successful onboarding can be felt in the long run as well.\n\n  * Nine in 10 would feel more strongly integrated into the company culture\n  * Employees reported 50% higher benefits utilisation\n  * They're 38% more confident in their ability to do their jobs\n  * Staff were 30 times more likely to have high job satisfaction\n  * 80% more likely to rate the organisation's performance as \"strong\"\n  * And 113 times more likely to rate HR's capability highly\n\n[READ MORE: Indeed reveals the secrets to a golden onboarding\nplan](https://www.hcamag.com/au/specialisation/employee-engagement/indeed-\nreveals-the-secrets-to-a-golden-onboarding-plan/153709)\n\nHRD spoke to an industry leader, who shared best practice tips for onboarding\nnew hires.\n\n**1\\. Understand that effective onboarding extends beyond the first 90 days**  \nOnboarding needs to be an ongoing process and will be much more effective at\nsix months to a year. The HR practitioner told us that too many companies stop\nthe process after \"a very short period\" and when they're no longer the \"new\nguy\".\n\nRecruits need continued support in order to feel valued, so employers should\nmake an effort to plan out an induction process that goes beyond their first\nweek.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n**2\\. Be clear about how their role is critical to the company 's success**  \nExpectations of their role may have been defined during the interview process,\nbut it's important to reinforce how they fit into the organisation's \"big\npicture\".\n\nSuccessfully doing so will instil a sense of purpose and loyalty in new hires.\nFailing which could result in employees quickly feeling like they're \"just\nanother cog in the machine\".\n\n**3\\. Ensure managers are actively involved in the onboarding experience**  \nThis can help better engage new hires and make them feel like critical\nadditions to the team, said the practitioner. Also, if managers seem out of\nreach from the get-go, it can create an \"us versus them\" barrier and stifle\nperformance.\n\nInvolving managers in the induction process can show that leaders are prepared\nto invest in their team members and push them to perform better.\n\n**4\\. Implement a mentoring or buddy system**  \nThe idea of assigning a mentor or buddy to a new hire is nothing new, but it\ncan go a long way in sustaining a positive employee experience.\n\nEmployees will feel highly supported by the organisation, and can also explore\ntangible career pathways, making them feel secure about their future with the\ncompany.\n\n**5\\. Get the workstation ready to go on their first day**  \nThis may seem like a minor detail, but it's a simple way to show that the new\nemployee is welcomed into the team and overall organisation.\n\nIt could also instil a sense of diligence and purpose, and lay the foundation\nfor many years of engagement.\n\n### Related stories\n\n  * [Inside Societe Generale's employee engagement](/asia/news/opinion-and-best-practice/inside-societe-generales-employee-engagement/178109)\n  * [How to hire millennials - and keep them too](/asia/news/general/how-to-hire-millennials-and-keep-them-too/150179)\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily newsletters\nfrom HRD Asia.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n### Recent articles & video\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637218764030398689.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-\nbreaker-mom-advises-against-prolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: MOM advises against 'prolonged' no-pay\nleave](/asia/specialisation/payroll/circuit-breaker-mom-advises-against-\nprolonged-no-pay-leave/219171)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218756963772601.jpg)](/asia/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219166)\n\n#### [How has COVID-19 impacted managers and\nemployees?](/asia/news/general/how-has-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-\nemployees/219166)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218753186012580.jpg)](/asia/news/general/ceo-\nof-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-from-a-challenge/219160)\n\n#### [CEO of HP Canada: 'I was never one to shy away from a\nchallenge'](/asia/news/general/ceo-of-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-\nfrom-a-challenge/219160)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217706478717086.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/change-\nmanagement/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-support-employees/219005)\n\n#### [Circuit Breaker: How can HR support\nemployees?](/asia/specialisation/change-management/circuit-breaker-how-can-hr-\nsupport-employees/219005)\n\n### Most Read Articles\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n06 Apr 2020\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n__\n\n  * [HRT](https://www.hrtechnologynews.com/)\n  * [Companies](/asia/companies)\n  * [People](/asia/people)\n  * [Newsletter](/asia/newsletter)\n\n  * [About us](/asia/about-us)\n  * [Authors](/asia/authors)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/asia/privacy-policy)\n  * [Conditions of use](/asia/conditions-of-use)\n  * [Contact us](/asia/contact-us)\n  * [RSS __](/asia/rss)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/HumanResourcesDirectorAsia/)[__](https://twitter.com/HRD_Asia)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/human-\nresources-director-asia)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Key Media ![](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n"}, {"item": "3 Creative Ways to Recruit Tech Talent - HR Technologist", "link": "https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/creative-ways-to-recruit-tech-talent/", "guid": "CAIiEAdpWuE5tWx45Rma05cx9EIqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowuaD7CjD8y_MCMMr1oQY", "pubdate": "Wed, 11 Mar 2020 13:48:32 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/creative-ways-to-recruit-tech-talent/\" target=\"_blank\">3 Creative Ways to Recruit Tech Talent</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">HR Technologist</font>", "source": "HR Technologist", "body": "![](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/images/loaderimage.gif)\n\n  * Skip to Main Navigation\n  * Skip to Main Content\n  * Skip to Footer\n\n[![](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/images/logo.png?20170407)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com \"HR Technologist\")\n\n  * [ Articles](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/ \"Articles\")\n  * [ Interviews](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/ \"Interviews\")\n  * [ News](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/ \"News\")\n  * [ Resources](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/whitepapers/ \"Resources\")\n  * [ Webinars](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/webinar/ \"Webinars\")\n\n  * Follow Us \n\nFollow Us\n\n[ __](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist \"Follow Us on Facebook\") [\n__](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist \"Follow Us on Twitter\") [\n__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-technologist \"Follow Us on LinkedIn\")\n[ __](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/feed/ \"Subscribe to RSS Feed\")\n\n  * [ __](javascript:void\\(0\\);

As a [recent study by\nAccenture](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/31/apprenticeships-are-best-way-to-\nsolve-skills-gap-says-accenture.html) found, there are 7 million job openings\nand only 5.8 million available workers. But in reality, the 1.2 million\ndifference only scratches the surface and doesn't address the underlying\nproblem of lack of training and skills. As a result, the workforce required to\nbridge the gap needs to be highly specialized. However, the most common\nalternatives \u2013 like coding boot camps and traditional IT programs at\nuniversities\u2013 aren't usually able to provide potential job candidates with\naccess to the critical, specialized training required by modern\nenterprises.Jobs are growing more complicated every year, with corporate\nexpectations rising all while not taking on the full responsibility for\ncreating a talent acquisition strategy and pipeline necessary for incoming\nprogrammers to succeed. This widening tech skills gap and subsequent pressure\nto bring on the best talent is felt across all organizations and departments,\nbut perhaps none bear the brunt more than HR.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nWhile many believe the responsibility for addressing the skills gap falls on\nacademic institutions, here are three immediate and impactful paths that\ncompanies can take to bridge the skills divide.\n\n## **Dive into a non-traditional talent pool**\n\nBeyond the 1.2 million gaps between job openings to available workers, there\nare roughly 70,000 computer science graduates per year, making up less than 4%\nof the total conferred bachelor's degrees. Even worse, only about two-thirds\nof those graduates land a programming job. When you factor in the amount of\ncompetition for those graduates, the vast majority of companies are left in\nthe lurch trying to find qualified candidates for their open positions.\n\nHowever, computer science graduates \u2013 even related STEM majors \u2013 aren't the\nonly ones who possess the skills necessary to be an impactful programmer. The\nlogical reasoning, complex problem-solving skills, and curiosity that the best\ndevelopers need can be found in graduates from institutions and majors outside\nthe borders of what is considered to be the traditional job requirements. By\nfocusing on those skills and the aptitude and attitude your company looks for,\nHR leaders can catalyze growth by delivering qualified talent by merely\nlooking at a wider pool of applicants. Although widening the talent aperture\nmay seem daunting, doing so will open your organization to increased levels of\ndiversity of thought, experience, and background, which are necessary to be\ncompetitive. To ensure early and continued success for these non-traditional\nprogrammers, corporations will need to start offering continuous learning\nbenefits. As more HR leaders and organizations broaden their talent pools,\nthey will effectively begin closing the overall skills gap.\n\n## **Public/Private Partnerships**\n\nWhile networking and active recruiting will always be an excellent avenue to\nidentify and place candidates, the reality is that not everyone is fortunate\nenough to have those connections, particularly in tech. Just as they do for\n[government agencies and enterprises, public-private\npartnerships](https://hbr.org/2019/01/what-successful-public-private-\npartnerships-do) present a massive opportunity for companies to develop and\nimplement programs at colleges and universities that offer practical, targeted\ncurriculum. These partnerships also provide invaluable networking\nopportunities for students to connect as well as the business community at\nlarge. With nearly every company having its technological footprints, public-\nprivate partnerships offer curated programs that are mutually beneficial to\nuniversities and corporations.\n\nToday, companies already recognize the merits and opportunities of these\npublic-private partnerships. They are working alongside academic institutions\nto train students on the technical skills they need to succeed in today's\ntech-first world.\n\nFor companies that are looking to make inroads in a specific region, broaching\na public-private partnership \u2013 often beginning with something as simple as a\ncareer fair, guest lectures, or partnerships with IT programs\u2013 can be a\nmutually beneficial alternative for students, institutions, and companies.\n\n**Learn More:[5 Tips for Recruiting and Retaining Women in\nTech](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/diversity/five-tips-for-\nrecruiting-and-retaining-women-in-tech/)**\n\n## **Apprenticeships Aren't Just for the Trades**\n\nFor centuries, apprenticeships were synonymous with the trades, yet when\nbroken down to their core, principles apprenticeships are on-the-job training\nprograms. Whereas internships often offer an exploratory experience to\ndetermine a student's future career path, apprenticeships offer applied\nlearning - impactful training and experience - for a chosen career path under\nthe tutelage of experts that are invested in the developmental process.\nCompanies like Accenture and others are already investing in apprenticeship\nprograms that tap into the non-traditional, deep well of potential candidates\nthat are often overlooked, yet eager for an opportunity to show they're up to\nthe challenge. Whether they're community college students or other alternative\ncandidates, instilling the necessary technical skills while hiring and\ndeveloping motivated, diverse, and devoted talent will be a crucial driver of\nsuccess for companies moving forward. Apprenticeships are also a natural\nextension to public-private partnerships for companies looking to make long-\nterm, deep commitments to a given institution or region.\n\nAs the rate of digital transformation and innovation continues to increase,\ncompanies will continue to face pressure to hire qualified, impactful tech\ntalent, and HR leaders are going to bear the brunt of that effort. As leaders\nof culture and growth, HR can serve as a change agent within the broader\norganization by helping adopt alternative solutions, like apprenticeships or\npublic-private partnerships. As these alternative solutions continue to bear\nfruit, the overall technical skills gap will inherently begin shrinking, which\nis the best-case scenario for all parties. Technology is about innovation at\nits foundation, so it's time to apply those principles to the skills gap by\ntaking a solutions-oriented approach.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Efficiently Hire Gen Z Tech\nTalent](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-to-\nefficiently-hire-gen-z-tech-talent/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fcreative-ways-to-recruit-tech-\ntalent%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=3+Creative+Ways+to+Recruit+Tech+Talent\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=3+Creative+Ways+to+Recruit+Tech+Talent&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fcreative-ways-to-recruit-tech-\ntalent%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fcreative-ways-to-recruit-tech-\ntalent%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fcreative-ways-to-recruit-tech-\ntalent%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=3 Creative Ways to Recruit Tech\nTalent&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fcreative-ways-to-recruit-tech-\ntalent%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

[Who\nthey are and what they are looking for](https://www.powermag.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/us-cons-positioning-utilities-to-win-the-battle-for-\ntalent.pdf) is still not fully understood by many talent acquisition leaders.\n\n## What Are Millennial Candidates Looking For?\n\n[Cardigan](https://cardigancg.com/) has done several focus groups at\ncompanies, universities, and co-working spaces to better understand what\ncandidates are looking for in an employer. We always start by asking them to\nfinish this sentence, \u201cI want to work for a company that is\u2026\u201d Their top five\nanswers are fast-paced, collaborative, innovative/disruptive, people-centered,\nand stable.\n\n  * **Fast-paced\u2014** They are used to learning new technology and absorbing lots of information, so a fast-paced environment is important to keep them from getting bored.\n  * **Collaboration\u2014** They love working in teams and learning from others\u2019 ideas and experiences\u2014this means more project and teamwork vs. working in silos.\n  * **Innovation/Disruption\u2014** They want to be on the forefront and work for companies that are changing the industry, doing things that haven\u2019t been done before. That level of challenge is appealing and keeps them engaged.\n  * **People-centered\u2014** Long gone are the days when people give their all to a company with very little in return. Millennials expect it to be a mutually beneficial relationship and if the odds are ever not in their favor, they will look to leave. If you take care of them, they will be there for you. They grew up and saw how their parents were loyal to a company that wasn\u2019t loyal to them when the numbers didn\u2019t work out and they refuse to follow into the same trap.\n  * **Stability\u2014** Last but not least is stability. After seeing what happened to their parents, working for a company that\u2019s been around for many years and with long-tenured co-workers is actually appealing to millennials.\n\nWhat can you do to make your company stand out? Take what candidates are\nlooking for, see where there is a match between their wants and what your\ncompany has to offer\u2014then communicate the heck out of it. It\u2019s not just about\nchanging your culture\u2014it\u2019s more of a yes, and\u2026\u2014but start with making the best\nwith what you have.\n\n![](https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/picture1-887x1024.png)\n\n## Establish a Strong Employer Brand\n\nEvery organization should make a purposeful investment in the development and\nmanagement of their employer brand\u2014whether that is dollars invested each year,\nor time and energy of employees. But the one thing to remember is that\n[employer branding](https://cardigancg.com/employer-branding-trends/) is\neveryone\u2019s job\u2014not just HR\u2014and when done well, it will set you up for success.\n\nUnlike your company brand, which is your promise to your customers and written\nin marketing language with broad appeal, your employer brand is your promise\nto your employees and is written from a cultural perspective and is often\nsegmented to reach appeal to different groups. Your employer brand speaks to\nyour candidates in their voice (this is a key distinction).\n\nWhen done right, you employer brand helps you shine a light on what your\ncompany has to offer, what makes it unique beyond salary and benefits\u2014because\nanyone can copy or match those things. It can also help overcome the negative\nimage the energy industry has with younger candidates. This is your chance to\nshow candidates that you aren\u2019t the energy organization of the past, and\nseparate yourself from the rest of the pack.\n\n## Get Online and Social\n\nThe first thing anyone does to learn more about your company is a simple\nonline search. Are you proud of your company\u2019s online presence? Your company\u2019s\ncareers website is the perfect place to tell your story and show off what\nmakes you unique\u2014e.g., your employer brand.\n\nOur research has found that millennial candidates are typically looking to see\nfour things on your website; [we call them the \u201c4 P\u2019s\u201d: Personality, People,\nPlaces, and Projects](https://cardigancg.com/4-ways-to-make-your-company-\nculture-shine-online/).\n\nThe next place they will look is social media\u2014LinkedIn, Facebook, and\nInstagram. These platforms allow candidates to see what\u2019s happening around the\noffice and read what people are saying. Social media platforms are kind of\nlike the Glassdoor of employer brand because much of the content can be\ngenerated by employees.\n\nSocial platforms are also a great place to share the projects you are working\non and to showcase the people behind them\u2014while you are educating candidates\non the great things your company does, an online feature is always a fun way\nto recognize high performing employees for their efforts. A \u201cday in the life\u201d\nemployee profile (a.k.a. realistic job preview) can help potential applicants\nsee themselves in the role, especially in those areas that you may have\ntrouble filling.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening right now is a great example. While many workers are\npracticing social distancing due to COVID-19, the energy Industry is hard at\nwork\u2014show your people out there on the front lines, literally keeping the\nlights on for communities and hospitals, and tell their stories. Talk about\nthe new tech you\u2019re using. Talk about partnerships with government entities\nand how its aiding in the fight. That is what is going to connect with your\ncandidates.\n\nIf millennials want to be a part of something bigger than themselves, there is\nprobably nothing more meaningful right now, and nothing more American than to\nfight in this crisis.\n\n## Make Sure Your Interns Have an Amazing Experience\n\nThis one hits a little more on Gen Z than millennials unless they are graduate\nstudents, but if we want to build our bench we must think ahead. Think of your\ninterns as your best referral resource. When everyone gets back to school,\nthey will compare stories\u2014how they were treated, the projects they worked on,\nthe new and exciting technology they learned to use, and yes, the pay. So,\nmake sure your intern program is competitive and you are assigning challenging\nand meaningful projects that will allow them to see the results before they\nleave your campus. The amount of goodwill and promotion you will get on social\nmedia will do so much for your brand as an employer and make it easier to\nrecruit moving forward.\n\n## What Can You Do to Retain Them?\n\nSelect employees whose values align with your own. When we have an employee\nthat turns in a resignation letter and we don\u2019t want to lose them, we often\ntry to match the offer dollar for dollar and promotion for promotion. Though\nmore pay is often a reason for leaving an organization, increases in pay have\ndiminishing returns on keeping employees.\n\nThe majority of the millennials we\u2019ve interviewed or focused-grouped are\nseeking companies that have similar values, and companies that are tackling\nthe problems they want to tackle. It\u2019s more about the mission and the work.\nSo, if you\u2019re honest about your values and the problems you are trying to\nsolve, you will attract people who believe what you believe\u2014which is exactly\nwhat you want.\n\n![](https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/no2-802x1024.png)\n\n## Have a Killer Onboarding Process\n\nAlmost [30% of new employees quit within the first 90\ndays](https://www.inc.com/adam-robinson/3-common-mistakes-that-make-new-\nemployees-want-to-quit-in-first-3-months.html) of a new job. The reason many\npeople leave organizations in this window is that most organizations do a poor\njob of onboarding new employees. Many organizations do a great job courting\ncandidates but are making promises that their company culture and orientation\ncan\u2019t keep.\n\nAn exceptional onboarding experience is critical to making your new employee\nfeel welcome, and showing them the alignment between your company values and\ntheir own. Below [are four components to a best-in-class\nonboarding](https://cardigancg.com/best-in-class-onboarding/) experience:\n\n  * **Experience Over Presentation\u2014** No one wants to watch a boring presentation. Get people up and moving, focus on activities that teach.\n  * **Build a Cohort\u2014** If you have a best friend at work, you are less likely to leave than someone who doesn\u2019t. Building connection through their cohort gives them a \u201cphone a friend,\u201d and also strengthens your team.\n  * **Live the Values\u2014** It\u2019s great to talk about your value of service (everyone has one) but how is that operationalized at your company? Allow employees to see and experience the values in real life.\n  * **Celebrate\u2014** Once it\u2019s time to \u201cgraduate\u201d new employee orientation, make it a big deal. People will always remember how you made them feel, and you want them to know that you are happy to have them in your organization.\n\nThe key to attracting and retaining talent of any generation is clarity about\nthe candidate you\u2019re going after, understanding their needs, speaking honestly\nabout how you can meet those needs, welcoming them into your organization, and\ncreating a space that lets them do their best work every day.\n\n_\u2014 **Dr. Harold Hardaway** is a speaker and thought leader on corporate\ncommunications and culture.

2020\noutlook based on the COVID-19 pandemic, but more importantly highlighted\nwhat's happening on the ground as enterprises navigate shutdowns, employee\nsafety and digital continuity.\n\nFor Wall Street, Accenture's [second quarter earnings\nreport](https://investor.accenture.com/~/media/Files/A/Accenture-\nIR-V3/quarterly-earnings/2020/q2fy20/q2fy20-earnings-release.pdf) wasn't about\nthe quarter just ended, but the outlook and a dose of business reality. For\ninstance, Accenture is a company full of consultants that travel. Not only did\nAccenture have to navigate its own COVID-19 response but help clients through\ntheir own turmoil.\n\n  * [Working from home: Your common challenges](https://www.zdnet.com/article/working-from-home-your-common-challenges-and-how-to-tackle-them/)\n  * [Working in a coronavirus world: Strategies and tools for staying productive](https://www.zdnet.com/article/effective-strategies-and-tools-for-remote-work-during-coronavirus/)\n  * [How coronavirus is accelerating the future of work](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-coronavirus-may-accelerate-the-future-of-work/)\n  * [Work from home: 64 expert tips for staying healthy, happy, and productive](https://www.zdnet.com/article/work-from-home-64-expert-tips-for-staying-healthy-happy-and-productive/)\n  * [Managing telecommuters? Here are 8 management tips](https://www.zdnet.com/article/managing-telecommuters-due-to-novel-coronavirus-here-are-8-management-tips/)\n\nWhat's apparent is that Accenture's software tools and cloud and security\nservices are faring well. Accenture said 65% of new bookings were related to\nits new digital businesses. Accenture CEO Julie Sweet also noted that the\ncompany had digital continuity plans, remote work and client services that\ncould be handled from afar. Accenture reported fiscal second quarter revenue\nof $11.14 billion, up 7% from a year ago as consulting and outsourcing\nservices fared well. Earnings for the quarter were $1.25 billion, or $1.91 a\nshare.\n\nAs for the outlook, Accenture said its third quarter will rocky with revenue\ngrowth of negative 2% to positive 2%. For the fiscal year, Accenture is\nprojecting revenue growth of 3% to 6%, down from its initial guidance of 6% to\n8%. Earnings for the year will be between $7.48 a share to $7.70 a share, down\nfrom $7.66 a share to $7.84 a share.\n\n![acn-q2-2020.png](https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2020/03/19/8f100a01-91a3-4a3b-ad7b-71c4cb7412d5/acn-q2-2020.png)\n\nIn other words, Accenture's outlook, which is fluid given the novel\ncoronavirus outbreak globally, is better than feared. Why? Here are some key\ntakeaways.\n\n**What Accenture customers are doing to deal with COVID-19. Sweet served up a\nfew examples about how enterprise clients are handling the pandemic.**\n\n  * One client implemented Microsoft Teams across their entire workforce of 61,000 employees in 5 days. See: [Microsoft Teams usage up by 12 million in the past week, hitting 44 million daily active users, due largely to COVID-19](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-teams-usage-up-by-12-million-in-the-past-week-hitting-44-million-daily-active-users-due-largely-to-covid-19/)\n  * Public sector clients are deploying more virtual agents preconfigured with COVID-19 advice to free up call center capacity. \n  * Mission critical services to settle services, trades and payroll as well as healthcare workflows are coming to the forefront and being executed remote and securely. \n  * An automotive industry client is retooling its transformation strategy due to COVID-19. \"You have a client in the industry and automotive industry that has been hard hit. We're executing our strategy beautifully there because we're helping them with enterprise transformation and they're making choices in this environment given what they're facing,\" said Sweet. \"So in that case, for example, they said, look, our HR transformation is mission-critical. We may need to and are likely to postpone the finance transformation. And they're working with us and their other partners as they make the essential choices you would expect in this environment.\"\n\n **Accenture's own digital transformation.** Accenture has pivoted to be more\nof a cloud services and software provider. Sweet said Accenture landed more\nthan $100 million deals with 18 clients with momentum for its [SynOps\noperating engine](https://www.zdnet.com/article/accenture-launches-synops-to-\nmeld-data-ai-and-humans-as-the-automation-bandwagon-swells/), which combines\ndata, analytics, and emerging tools to revamp business processes. Accenture\nhas also launched a platform called Living Systems, which brings an agile\napproach to applications, talent and technology.\n\n  * [Accenture's 2020 Vision warns of a 'tech-clash' in a post-digital society](https://www.zdnet.com/article/accentures-2020-vision-warns-of-a-tech-clash-in-a-post-digital-society/)\n  * [Accenture: Can your enterprise survive the tech-clash?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/accenture-can-your-enterprise-survive-the-tech-clash/)\n\n**Continuity planning.** Sweet noted that Accenture doesn't have a\nheadquarters and global leaders are spread out already. \"While we have not\nplanned for a global pandemic, the ability to trigger these (crisis\nmanagement) protocols and then adapt for this unprecedented situation is\nallowing us to move rapidly,\" she said. \"We are deeply experienced in working\nvirtually and already have deployed at scale in the normal course in our\nbusiness, collaboration technologies and infrastructure for remote working.\nFor example, we're the largest user of Teams by Microsoft in the world. And in\nthe last few weeks, as we rapidly ramped more people working remotely from\nhome, Team's audio usage has almost doubled from our typical 16 million\nminutes per day to almost 30 million minutes per day.\"\n\n  * [Accenture launches software to simulate cloud architecture, services at scale](https://www.zdnet.com/article/accenture-launches-software-to-simulate-cloud-architecture-services-at-scale/)\n\n **Accenture will save on travel**. CFO Kathleen McClure noted that Accenture\nwill lose travel reimbursement revenue from clients, but also save money by\nnot traveling. Accenture has 500,000 people with significant travel costs even\nthough the company has utilized collaboration tools and remote work. The\ncoronavirus pandemic will boost margins as those travel costs decrease.\n\nAccenture is betting it can recruit talent in the downturn. Sweet said:\n\n> We're obviously slowing recruiting but we're still recruiting. Like, for\n> example, in Italy, and we all know the situation in there, we're still\n> recruiting for security right now because as our clients have been moving to\n> home, they need greater help in security services. And just a shout out to\n> our HR team, we've rapidly turned our onboarding into entirely virtual so\n> that we can continue to recruit the critical services our clients need\n> during this time, when obviously we cannot have people coming to the office.\n\nSweet added that the company is always scouting for new skills. \"It is\nimportant to remember that we will continue to invest in our business and our\npeople for the long-term,\" she said.\n\n### Related Topics:\n\n[ Cloud ](/topic/cloud/) [ CXO ](/topic/cxo/) [ Innovation\n](/topic/innovation/) [ Digital Transformation: A CXOs Guide ](/topic/digital-\ntransformation-a-cxos-guide/) [ Big Data Analytics ](/topic/big-data/)\n\n  *   *   *   *   *   *   * \n\n[ ![Larry\nDignan](https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/04/26/eb462fe7-e39e-43ba-\nabbd-c4ca2442306e/thumbnail/40x40/598bc42bb7d091da963c67ba9b0513f9/larry-\ndignan-eic.jpg) ](/meet-the-team/us/larry-dignan/)\n\nBy [ Larry Dignan ](/meet-the-team/us/larry-dignan/) for [Between the\nLines](/blog/btl/) | March 19, 2020 -- 13:58 GMT (21:58 GMT+08:00) | Topic:\n[Coronavirus: Business and technology in a pandemic](/topic/coronavirus-\nbusiness-and-technology-in-a-pandemic/)\n\nShow Comments\n\nLOG IN TO COMMENT\n\n  * [My Profile](/members/preferences/)\n  * [Log Out](/user/logout/)\n\n| [Community Guidelines](http://cbsi.force.com/CBSi/zdnetcommunityfaq)\n\n###  Join Discussion\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\nAdd Your Comment\n\nPlease review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription.\n\nBy registering, you agree to the [Terms of\nUse](http://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/terms-of-use) and acknowledge\nthe data practices outlined in the [Privacy\nPolicy](https://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy/highlights).\n\nYou will also receive a complimentary subscription to the ZDNet's Tech Update\nToday and ZDNet Announcement newsletters.

\"Sophie Ireland\") __[Corporate\nCommentary](https://ceoworld.biz/corporate/ \"Corporate Commentary\") __March\n25, 2020\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20960%20641'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://ceoworld.biz/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/video-conference.jpg)\n\n  * __\n\n  * __\n\n  * __\n\n  * __\n\n  * __\n\n  * __\n\n  * __\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak in 2020 has forced many businesses to move online and\neven focus solely online. On the other hand, enterprises that seek an easy and\nseamless to hire new employees this pandemic season, have to adopt\ntechnological apps. These are innovative applications that will streamline the\nhiring process and ensure that neither the health of the HR manager or\nprospective candidates is put at risk.\n\nWhat's more, the accuracy, precision, and cognitive intelligence offered by\ntechnology provide companies and HR teams a quicker and more efficient way to\nscreen job applicants. Therefore, the hiring process is faster and takes\nlesser resources. This makes technology a must use in recruiting and assessing\npotential employees.\n\n **VidCruiter Innovative Technology**\n\nOne modern technology that has stolen the light of the day is\n[VidCruiter](https://vidcruiter.com/video-interviewing/). This is a video\nrecruitment application that offers companies and human resource managers\nunique tools to enable them to hire new workers. VidCruiter also brings about\ncost benefits while at the same time providing a more enhanced candidate\nexperience. Over and above that, VidCruiter features include:\n\n  1.  **Video Interviewing:  \n**VidCruiter video interview software allows you to get pre-recorded videos of\nyour candidate's responses, or conduct live interviews. It works with you from\nthe early stages of screening to the final interview. As such, this level of\nsupport helps to speed up the interviewing process and also save travel\nexpenses. In the case of the latter, the coronavirus epidemic won't be a\nlimitation since you can still hire employees as they adhere to movement\nrestrictions.\n\n  2.  **Audio Interviewing:**  \nIt's possible to wrongly analyze a candidate that will handle the customer\nrepresentative aspect of your company just by reading their resume or\nlistening to them on phone. As such, VidCruiter's audio interviewing feature,\nVidAudioInterviewing offers you another way to assess the communication skills\nof potential employees. You can use the audio interviewing to assess each\ncandidate's voice quality, pronunciation, and level of comprehension even\nbefore an interview is conducted.\n\n  3.  **Structured Digital Interviews:**  \nVidCruiter encourages the use of structured digital interviews to get\ndifferent responses to the same question from potential candidates. The goal\nis to find the most ideal candidate instead of being biased. It also saves the\ncompany from a legal lawsuit since there is no favoritism and every candidate\nis examined using the same question(s). Much more, candidates are selected\nusing objective rankings instead of subjective instincts.\n\n  4.  **Automated Referencing:**  \nMore references often mean spending more time and resources to go through\neach. Nonetheless, VidCruiter's automated referencing, VidReferencing\nautomatically requests and verifies references submitted by hundreds of\ncandidates. For this reason, you can ask for as many references as you'd like,\nyet save yourself the extra costs that would've been attracted for reviewing\nthem. There's also the short amount of time an automated reference checking\nsystem uses compared to manually sorting out references to make verifications.\n\n  5.  **Skills Testing:**  \nVidCruiter\u2019s digital skills testing software offers a unique and intuitive\nuser interface to examine the technical skills of potential employees. These\ntests can become a part of the hiring process to ensure the candidate you\nchoose has knowledge of basic technological tools. Accordingly, the tests\ncenter on Microsoft Excel & PowerPoint, RFP simulations, typing speeds, script\nreading, amongst others.\n\n **Benefits of Using Technology to Hire Prospective Candidates**\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20960%20640'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://ceoworld.biz/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/video-conference-1.jpg)\n\n

potential candidates and employees\noffers numerous benefits. Some of these benefits include:\n\n  1.  **Wider Talent Pool:**  \nJob roles advertised online, receive more applicants compared to the use of\nprinted ads. The same can be said when the hiring process is conducted online\nsince you can interview more candidates. These benefits are why 92% of\nrecruiters in 2015 resorted to social platforms to get candidates. That being\nthe case, you're offered a larger pool of talents around the world when you\nadvertise your job roles online. What's more, job seekers on your platform can\napply for numerous roles with just a click.\n\n  2.  **Simplifies Process:**  \nTechnology makes the hiring process easier for recruiters and applicants. For\nstarters, the applicant can pre-record a video at their convenience and submit\nit to your company to be reviewed. In the same vein, you can review these\nvideos in your own time and anywhere. It's also worth noting that there are\nautomated tools that help to schedule interviews, administer assessments,\nanalyze references, amongst others, thereby reducing human interaction. Due to\nthese benefits, 60% of companies in 2013 began using video interviews for\nhiring.\n\n  3.  **Faster and Cheaper:**  \nIt is entirely possible to manage the applications of candidates in the least\namount of time thanks to a recruitment system. The time that would've been\nspent making arrangements to meet the candidate in an office or even cover\ntheir travel expenses is eliminated. Furthermore, an applicant tracking system\nhelps to sort candidates based on the qualification. It also makes it easy to\nobtain references and verify them without manually going through each.\n\n  4.  **Bias-Free:**  \nHumans can easily be swayed by the appearance of a person or their\nrelationship with other people. When that happens, it could make them biased\nwhen choosing prospective employees, which could cost them talent and money.\nFor example, 75% of employees revealed that they hired the wrong person for a\nposition. Contrastingly, the use of technological apps focuses on an\nindividual's qualifications, skills, and experience during screening. That\nbeing so, it eliminates the potential for bias since the best interviewees are\nselected using these criteria.\n\nThe use of technology for remote interviewing enables enterprises to hire more\nworkers without inviting them to their offices. VidCruiter, for instance, has\nprovided all the tools that will make the hiring process more efficient,\ncheaper, and faster even in the face of a global pandemic. Accordingly, if\nyou're out to get these benefits while increasing your workforce, it's an\napplication you need to employ.\n\n* * *\n\nHave you read?\n\n# [Largest crude steel-producing countries in the world,\n2020.](https://ceoworld.biz/2020/02/06/revealed-the-worlds-largest-crude-\nsteel-producing-countries-2020/ \"Largest crude steel-producing countries in\nthe world, 2020.\")  \n# [Most expensive hotels in the world for high net worth individuals,\n2020](https://ceoworld.biz/2020/01/31/worlds-most-expensive-hotels-for-high-\nnet-worth-individuals-2020/ \"Most expensive hotels in the world for high net\nworth individuals, 2020\")  \n# [Most traffic-congested cities in the world,\n2020](https://ceoworld.biz/2020/01/30/these-are-the-most-traffic-congested-\ncities-in-the-world-2020/ \"Most traffic-congested cities in the world, 2020\")  \n# [Cities around the world with the most and least stressed-out employees,\n2020](https://ceoworld.biz/2020/01/30/workplace-burnout-cities-around-the-\nworld-with-the-most-and-least-stressed-out-employees-2020/ \"Cities around the\nworld with the most and least stressed-out employees, 2020\")  \n# [Countries most and least prepared to deal with an epidemic or pandemic like\nthe Coronavirus](https://ceoworld.biz/2020/01/30/which-countries-are-most-and-\nleast-prepared-to-deal-with-an-epidemic-or-pandemic-like-the-coronavirus/\n\"Countries most and least prepared to deal with an epidemic or pandemic like\nthe Coronavirus\")\n\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __\n  * __ MORE\n\nSophie IrelandMarch 25, 2020\n\n![Sophie\nIreland](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20140%20140'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![Sophie\nIreland](https://ceoworld.biz/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/profile-150x150.jpg)\n\n[\n\n### Sophie Ireland\n\n](https://ceoworld.biz/author/sophie/ \"<h3>Sophie Ireland</h3>\")\n\nSophie Ireland is a Senior Editor in NYC with a strong interest in fashion,\nhigher education, travel, lifestyle, and more.

Innovid execs are hosting\nmeetings with kids on their laps or showing off their pets.\n\nGoodway Group hosted a half-hour \u201cFamily Fun Friday\u201d for employees with kids.\nIt included \u201cmusic, magic and laughs,\u201d said Jillian Pap, Goodway Group\u2019s\npeople experience director \u2013 and a much-needed lighthearted break for taxed\nworking parents.\n\nAt agencies F&B NY and The Media Kitchen, employees bring their kids or a\nglass of wine to end-of-day check-ins. During virtual lunches at PubMatic,\nemployees showcase pets and kids as they eat lunch together, said HR VP Lorrie\nDougherty.\n\n![](https://www.adexchanger.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/advertisement2.png)\n\nVox Media is hosting a daily story time for parents with kids, courtesy of its\nparent employee resource group. CEO Jim Bankoff recently\n[joined](https://twitter.com/Charlie_L_Hall/status/1240721725236666373) via\nZoom to read stories to families.\n\nJellyfish offered the services of its IT team to parents who needed to install\nsoftware for their kids\u2019 online classrooms, said Chief People Officer Marie\nRaimbert-Galtier.\n\nLiveIntent created Slack groups #the-bark-side, #thedailybaby,\n#parentsofliveintent and #WFHTipsandTricks, where people can stay positive and\nproductive, said Global Marketing SVP Kerel Cooper.\n\nThe New York Times\u2019 advertising team held a \u201cpet parade\u201d for everyone to show\noff their pets, said Sebastian Tomich, SVP and global head of advertising\nsolutions.\n\nAdExchanger\u2019s editorial team also set up a #wfh-pets-and-kids channel\npopulated by the office\u2019s cats, dogs and kids \u2013 all thriving under the new\nsetup.\n\nEfforts to embrace employees\u2019 new work-life balance include practical tips\ntoo. Merkle, for example, created an internal microsite with learning\nresources for parents whose kids are at home \u2013 along with a host of other\ncontent. Vox Media compiled recommendations for at-home activities, such as\nvirtual museum tours and free online classes, for parents to peruse.\n\n**Helping employees stay healthy**\n\nWhat better way to bond virtually with co-workers than take high-intensity\ninterval training classes together? At Cubeiq, employees meet virtually for\ntwice-weekly workout classes.\n\nSome PubMatic teams also set aside time for virtual workout classes. Or a\nmanager will set an \u201cexercise-from-home hour\u201d where everyone is encouraged to\ntake a walk or get active, CEO Rajeev Goel said.\n\nEngine Group started a meditation series Zen@Home. The optional 15-minute\nsessions offer tips to get through their day with better mental and physical\nhealth.\n\nMomentum Worldwide shared access to remote mindfulness, nutrition and fitness\nexperts to support employees, said Chief Talent Officer Jennifer Frieman.\n\nLiveIntent created a teledoc service that offers in-home COVID-19 testing for\nqualifying employees who swab themselves at home; the tests are sent overnight\nto a lab for results.\n\nTo give teams a break, SpotX\u2019s employee experience specialist will ask\nquestions or do quizzes to help employees get to know each other better. For\nexample, staff submitted baby pictures and had to match the pictures with each\nemployee.\n\nInnovid employees listen to a shared Spotify channel.\n\nHappy hours count as staying healthy, right? Recognizing the importance of\nsocializing, Merkle and other companies host virtual coffee and happy hours.\n\nFor after-hours bonding, PubMatic\u2019s HR team hosts a virtual trivia night.\nSmartyAds encourages teammates to watch TV series together in the evening.\n\nLaughter is often the best medicine. SmartyAds HR told employees to consider\nusing ridiculous virtual backgrounds in Zoom while in meetings to razz co-\nworkers.\n\n**\u2018Expense that\u2019**\n\nWhen SpotX\u2019s head of PR felt under the weather during the early days of the\ncoronavirus pandemic, the company covered her food delivery until she felt\nbetter. The gesture warmed her heart as much as the matzo ball soup, said\nCommunications Director Tammy Goodman.\n\nMerkle distributed printable artwork so people could spruce up their video\nconferencing backgrounds.\n\nInfutor gave its US employees a $100 Amazon gift card to use it however they\nsaw fit.\n\nWhile many companies would naturally foot the bill for remote working\nequipment, such as keyboards or monitors, Facebook, befitting of a deep-\npocketed advertising company, gave every employee a $1,000 bonus to equip\nthemselves for their new normal. It also said it would give everyone a top\nranking in their performance review, making them eligible for their regular\nbonuses.\n\n**Communication is key**\n\nFor all the perks and fun that HR is putting together for employees, one of\nthe most critical ways employers can go above and beyond is simple:\novercommunicate.\n\nAt LiveIntent, that means all-company meetings with executive Q&As every other\nweek, as well as biweekly updates about COVID-19 and the state of its\nbusiness, Cooper said. Leaders hop onto other teams\u2019 stand-up meetings to lend\nsupport to adjacent groups.\n\nMost companies said they are increasing the cadence of their communications to\nemployees. Executive teams are chatting more frequently, and more departmental\nheads are meeting to collaborate.\n\nWith the business situation changing so rapidly, employees value companies\nthat keep them in the loop most of all \u2013 with bonus points for companies that\ncheer them up with work-from-home photo contests, CEO story time and virtual\nhappy hours.\n\n  * Talk about it:\n    *     *     *     *   * [No comments](https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/how-employers-are-taking-care-of-their-workers-during-covid-19/#respond)\n  * [Add a comment](https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/how-employers-are-taking-care-of-their-workers-during-covid-19/#respond)\n\n\n\n### Add a comment\n\n[Click here to cancel reply.](/online-advertising/how-employers-are-taking-\ncare-of-their-workers-during-covid-19/#respond)\n\nName (required)\n\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\n\nWebsite\n\nComment\n\n**XHTML:** You can use these tags: `<a href=\"\" title=\"\"> <abbr title=\"\">\n<acronym title=\"\"> <b> <blockquote cite=\"\"> <cite> <code> <del datetime=\"\">\n<em> <i> <q cite=\"\"> <s> <strike> <strong> `\n\n## Get AdExchanger Newsletters\n\n[Sign Up](/newsletter)  \n  \n---  \n  \n  \n### Popular today on AdExchanger\n\n  * Popular\n\n  * Today Week Month All\n\n  * [Amazon Removes Third-Party Vendors From Its Affiliate Program](https://www.adexchanger.com/ecommerce-2/amazon-removes-third-party-vendors-from-its-affiliate-program/ \"Amazon Removes Third-Party Vendors From Its Affiliate Program\")\n\n  * [Chrome Is Rolling Back SameSite Security Changes Because Of Coronavirus](https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/chrome-is-rolling-back-samesite-security-changes-because-of-coronavirus/ \"Chrome Is Rolling Back SameSite Security Changes Because Of Coronavirus\")\n\n  * [How Employers Are Taking Care Of Their Workers During COVID-19](https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/how-employers-are-taking-care-of-their-workers-during-covid-19/ \"How Employers Are Taking Care Of Their Workers During COVID-19\")\n\n  * [MediaMath Cuts 8% Of Staff, Citing Coronavirus](https://www.adexchanger.com/platforms/mediamath-cuts-8-of-staff-citing-coronavirus/ \"MediaMath Cuts 8% Of Staff, Citing Coronavirus\")\n\n  * [As COVID-19 Boosts Streaming, Advertisers Can\u2019t Afford To Sit Out OTT Anymore](https://www.adexchanger.com/tv-and-video/as-covid-19-boosts-streaming-behavior-advertisers-cant-afford-to-sit-out-ott-anymore/ \"As COVID-19 Boosts Streaming, Advertisers Can\u2019t Afford To Sit Out OTT Anymore\")\n\n![Ajax spinner](https://www.adexchanger.com/wp-includes/images/wpspin-2x.gif)\n\n[![](https://www.adexchanger.com/wp-\ncontent/themes/adexchanger_2014/assets/img/images/AdExLogo-1.svg)](https://www.adexchanger.com)\n\n  * [Privacy Policy //](http://www.accessintel.com/privacypolicy/)\n  * [Advertise //](https://www.adexchanger.com/sponsorship/)\n  * [Contact Us](https://www.adexchanger.com/contact-adexchanger/)\n\n(C) 2020 [Access Intelligence, LLC](https://www.accessintel.com/) \\- All\nRights Reserved\n\n  * [](https://www.facebook.com/AdExchanger)\n  * [](https://twitter.com/adexchanger)\n  * [](https://www.linkedin.com/company/adexchanger-com?trk=top_nav_home)\n\n"}, {"item": "Human Resources Director -

It is an interesting juncture in the recruitment\ncycle \u2013 it marks the transformation of a candidate into an employee. Being\nsuch an early stage in the employee-organization relationship, employee\nonboarding is at the heart of the perception that a new employee forms of the\norganization.

At the other end of\nthe spectrum are organizations that have an onboarding plan comprising only\nthe basic (and often long-drawn) joining formalities. These organizations\nexpect their new recruits to hit the road running and just adapt.\n\nStudies prove that the onboarding period is the most crucial time in the\nemployee-organization relationship since it helps in forming reciprocal\nperceptions and even determines how the employee will behave and perform in\nthe future. The onboarding process is thus crucial, being the first hands-on\ninteraction the new employee has with the organization.\n\n**Learn More:[10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020\nHires](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/)**\n\n## **10 Employee Onboarding Checklist Items You Can't Afford to Miss**\n\nIn a rating-driven, socially hyperconnected world, an employee onboarding\nprocess gone wrong can make your employer brand suffer a ruthless dip. So, how\ndo you deliver a flawless, engaging [onboarding\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/) every time?\nStandardization is an effective tool that helps you structure the process by\nlimiting the impact of extraneous variables like the time of day, the basic\nstructure of the onboarding plan or the environment in which joining\nformalities are conducted.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the process of onboarding as a four-part system \u2013 pre-first day,\nthe first day, the first week, and the first 3\u20136 months. Here\u2019s a checklist of\nten items spanning the entire onboarding duration that you absolutely cannot\nafford to miss while planning and executing your employee onboarding\nmechanism:\n\n![Employee Onboarding Checklist](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **Pre-first day**\n\n  \nYou want your new employee to look forward to the first day. Most individuals\nare quite excited and anxious about it, and it should be easy to play into\nthis excitement to prepare for creating a unique experience for the new\nemployee.\n\n**1\\. Pre-engage the employee:** Have an open line of communication with the\nnew employee, since this is the first opportunity for employee engagement. How\ninvolved recruits feel during onboarding depends on how frequently and\neffectively they are engaged.\n\nNew employees must be informed in advance what the onboarding process will\nentail. Better still, all necessary paperwork can be completed before the date\nof joining. This will not only expedite the onboarding but also ensure that\nthe new employee does not feel lost or like they are drowning under a pile of\ndockets. DocuSign, for example, is easy to use the platform to get all\nsignatures in place before the employee arrives on the first day.\n\nThe time from the acceptance of the offer to the day of joining is when the\nemployee can become really eager to start off or completely disengaged.\nStarbucks and Amazon, with their coffee-CD packages and book bombs\nrespectively, have come up with meaningful ways for pre-first day prep.\n\n**Learn More:[What is Candidate Experience? Definition, Key Components, and\nStrategies](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\n\n**2\\. Inform the employee\u2019s team:** It is not the best experience to come in\non the first day into an organization where your team is utterly clueless\nabout who you are and why you are there. If you would not like sitting around\nwhile your team has to figure out what to do with you, why put new recruits\nthrough that either? It is important to ensure that the new employee\u2019s\nimmediate team and managers know well in advance about them and their new role\nin the organization. This only ensures a warmer welcome and a plan for the\nemployee to get started.\n\n**3\\. Have work systems ready to go:** How many stories have you heard of the\nnew employee waiting in the lounge or in one corner of a cubicle that someone\nwas kind enough to share all because their desk and system (work computer) was\nnot arranged for? Assuming that you would not want to make the employee feel\nrudderless and with no place to sit at, tick the third item off the checklist\nat least a day in advance \u2013 make sure they would have a designated place to\nwork out of, a system in place with all relevant login details, equipment, and\nsupplies.\n\n**Learn More:[Top 3 Innovative Corporate Recruitment Strategies for\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-3-innovative-corporate-recruitment-strategies-for-2019/)**\n\n### **First day**\n\n  \nThis is the real first glimpse that the new employee gets into the\norganization, and there is a lot riding on the first day. One thing to\nremember is that no matter what seniority level an employee joins into, their\nyears of experience, or their educational background, everyone is at least a\nlittle (if not a lot) nervous and uncomfortable on their first day. After all,\nit is a completely new reality with mostly strangers. The first day should\nthus be all about making the person feel comfortable and welcome in an\nenvironment that is empathetic, encouraging, and human.\n\n**4\\. Offer a welcome package with a walkabout:** An office tour, as opposed\nto mountains of paperwork, is a great way to begin the first day at work. This\nnot only acquaints employees with the building and where everything is but\nalso helps them to see and at last briefly connect with the people around.\nMost organizations do provide a welcome package, but it is a worthwhile\ninvestment to think beyond the notebook-pen-folder trio. The welcome package\ncould also be paperless and include a video (or maybe even virtual reality-\nbased) introduction to the organization and its structures and processes.\n\n**5\\. Plan a welcome from the leaders:** Meeting and interacting with\norganizational leaders and relevant managers goes a long way in boosting\nmorale. It makes sense that CEOs and MDs may not have their schedule free\nenough to welcome every employee individually, but usually, a group of\nemployees join on the same day, and a short session with the leaders would be\na great idea to get the new employees charged on day one. Lunch with the\nleaders is also a great way to add a touch of casual comfort to a process that\ncould otherwise be rigid and lecture-like.\n\n**Learn More** : **[Top 10 Employee Onboarding Software for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nemployee-onboarding-software/)**\n\n### **First week**\n\n  \nThe first week is for the new employees to find a basic routine and rhythm\nthat works for them. This is the time they can form social cliques, get to\nknow more about the organization without being too burdened with work, and\nprepare better for their role. The more informative the first week, the\nquicker the employee can hit the ground running.\n\n**6\\. Ensure manager support:** The one person (there could be more than one\nin a matrix organization) that the new employee needs to adapt and adjust to\nquickly is their immediate manager(s). The first week should allow enough\nscope and opportunity for the manager to spend time with their new teammate.\nThis would help both of them to not only come up with a sustainable and\nrealistic roadmap for the path ahead but also help the manager answer any\nquestions that the new employee may have.\n\n**7\\. Provide a mentor to count on:** Having a mentor at work can make a huge\ndifference not only from the point of view of job performance but also in\nmaking the employee feel that they have a trusted guide for their journey in\nthe organization. The mentor and mentee should connect over the first week to\nchart out performance and developmental goals that they wish to focus on in\nthe coming months.\n\n**8\\. Appoint a dedicated work peer:** Who does not want a friend at work?\nWhile it is great to allow natural cliques to form, having a dedicated peer\n(either a volunteer or a randomly assigned employee) for the first week at\nleast makes life a lot easier and work a lot more enjoyable for the new\nemployee. It always helps to have a familiar face in the team who can help you\nout with basic confusion you might have. It is best to have the peer assigned\nand well prepared in their role so that they can offer maximum help during the\nfirst week.\n\n**Learn More:[How to become a smart recruitment specialist in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-to-\nbecome-a-smart-recruitment-specialist/)**\n\n### **First three to six months**\n\n  \nMost onboarding processes occur between the first and the sixth month. There\nare two crucial points in this broader plan that you cannot ignore in your\nemployee onboarding checklist:\n\n**9\\. Plan a sustainable check-in calendar:** Whether you are looking at an\ninformal onboarding plan or a relatively stringent 30\u201360\u201390-day structure, it\nis important to pre-schedule regular check-ins that new employees would\nbenefit from with their manager, immediate team, the broader functional team,\nand with business leaders. Not all these check-ins need to be in the work\nsetting. Some could be planned as networking events, team outings, or even\ncatch-ups over coffee.\n\n**10\\. Get continuous feedback throughout the onboarding period:** At various\npoints throughout the onboarding process, it is important to ensure that the\nnew recruit is heard and their feedback on the onboarding mechanism is noted.\nThis not only makes the employee feel like they have valid contributions to\nmake and suggestions to add but also helps in tweaking the process for the\nnext batch of recruits.\n\n**Learn More:[4 Signs Your Employee Onboarding Process Needs\nRethinking](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/4-signs-your-employee-onboarding-process-needs-rethinking/)**\n\n## **Getting Onboard the Onboarding Bandwagon**\n\nThe best way to ensure that you have followed the employee onboarding\nchecklist is to have an engaged, motivated, and empathetic onboarding team in\nplace. The onus of this process does not lie solely upon the HR manager, the\nfunctional head, or the new recruit. Rather, the success of an employee\nonboarding program rests on their individual contributions. It is thus\nnecessary to make sure that they are all on board when it comes to the\nonboarding process.\n\n_What do you think are the most important points in the employee onboarding\nchecklist?

your onboarding process might not be at the top of every HR\nprofessional\u2019s priority list, but it probably should be -- especially if it\u2019s\nbeen over a year since your last update.\n\nWhy? Because an outdated onboarding experience might be sending the wrong\nsignals about a company -- and causing needless confusion -- at the very time\nwhen new hires are looking to [understand their new\nemployer](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/onboarding-first-day/) and find\ntheir place in the organization.\n\nIf that\u2019s not enough incentive, updating your onboarding also produces some\nmajor long-term benefits.\n\n[According to the Society of Human Resource Management\n](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/talent-\nacquisition/pages/dont-underestimate-the-importance-of-effective-\nonboarding.aspx)(SHRM), 69% of employees are more likely to stay at a company\nfor three or more years if they had a positive onboarding experience.\n\nNew employees who went through a [structured onboarding\nprogram](https://www.clickboarding.com/the-3-best-ways-to-retain-job-hoppers/)\nwere 58% more likely to be with the organization after three years.\n\nOrganizations with a standard onboarding process experience 50% greater new-\nhire productivity.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that we don\u2019t believe quality onboarding is important, it\u2019s\nthat we fail to recognize that it isn\u2019t a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d type of thing\n\u2014 it should be ever-evolving.\n\n## Why the Onboarding Process Needs to Evolve\n\nWhen was the last time you updated your onboarding process? Was it six months\nago? One year ago? Five years ago?\n\nWe get it \u2014 time flies. And while it might feel like it was just yesterday\nwhen you created your awesome new onboarding process, before you know it, a\nyear has passed and it\u2019s time to review, refine and update again.\n\nHere are some key reasons to update your onboarding experience.\n\n## Your service or product evolved\n\nThe key to [great\nonboarding](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/onboarding-2019/) is clarity.\nWhen you have a new employee join your ranks, you need to make it easy for\nthem to understand all they can about what you do, how you do it, and how they\nfit into the big picture. And if the heart of what you do as a business\nshifts, you might need to double-check your onboarding communication to ensure\neverything is aligned and that you\u2019re communicating it accurately.\n\nOnboarding should make things clearer, not more confusing \u2014 so make sure what\nyou say is what you actually do.\n\n## Your culture has shifted\n\nSocial integration and [knowledge of\nculture](https://www.bamboohr.com/blog/onboard-company-culture/) are two more\nvital elements to great onboarding. And while your [defined core\nvalues](https://elementthree.com/blog/5-steps-to-define-your-company-core-\nvalues/?utm_source=human%20capital%20institute&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=PR)\nreally shouldn\u2019t change much, if you have gone through a cultural shift,\nyou\u2019ll likely have to update your onboarding materials.\n\n Be warned: Not all cultural changes are apparent without reading the fine\nprint.\n\nFor example, if you decide to include some office inside jokes with the\nintention of making the new hire feel welcome, you might have to actually put\nyourself through the process to confirm understanding. Do the jokes still make\nsense? If your onboarding materials tell your new hire that most people eat\ntheir lunch in the cafeteria, make sure it\u2019s still true. While your core\nvalues may not have changed, behaviors and cultural norms of the office may\nhave.\n\n## Your brand just got updated\n\nLastly, you should update your onboarding experience if your employer branding\nhas changed. It\u2019s safe to assume that like [your\nbrand](https://elementthree.com/blog/why-changing-marketplaces-require-\nongoing-brand-\nevolution/?utm_source=human%20capital%20institute&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=PR),\nyour employer brand has evolved over time. And while you might not formally\nupdate your employer brand through brand guidelines, you can still look at the\nway you\u2019re communicating to new hires and determine whether or not it feels\nlike your organization.\n\n## Keep your onboarding on track\n\nGreat onboarding leads to great things \u2014 increased retention, a reduction in\nramp-up time and increased employee engagement. But it\u2019s not easy to get it\nright the first time around. Most onboarding processes go through multiple\niterations, revisions and \u201crebrands.\u201d But if you invest the time and energy to\nrefine your process, you\u2019ll be one step closer to creating an experience that\nwill benefit your organization for years to come.\n\n![Karen Seketa, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Karen\nSeketa, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Karen\nSeketa, HR Expert Contributor](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/01/karenseketabio-150x150.png)\n\n[Karen Seketa, HR Expert\nContributor](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/karenseketahrmorning-com/)\n\nKaren Seketa is the Vice President of Talent at [Element\nThree](https://elementthree.com/), a full-service marketing consultancy in\nIndianapolis that has been on the Inc. 5000 list for six consecutive years.

There\u2019s a lot that we don\u2019t know about the\nvirus, but we have some idea of how to curtail its spread. That\u2019s why the most\nessential step for HR leaders today is to empower employees in times of crisis\nand create robust business continuity plans. **_\n\nWhile medical experts and WHO are sharing timely updates on public health best\npractices, we spoke to 11 industry leaders who share tips on [how HR can\ncommunicate with employees](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-\ncompliance/coronavirus-hr-communication/) during a pandemic.\n\nHere\u2019s what companies, managers, and CHROs can do to make sense of and lead\nemployees through an uncertain situation:\n\n## **1\\. Build Day-to-Day Habits Around Good Hygiene and Limit Travel**\n\n[**Jennifer Dennard**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-dennard-822b0616/)\n**, COO, and co-founder,**[ **Range**](http://www.range.co)\n\n\u201cAs HR leaders, we play a critical role in business continuity helping teams\nunderstand risks, implementing practices to reduce them, and ensuring\noperations can continue as seamlessly as possible. For the coronavirus, we\u2019ve\nworked to define policies, resources, and sound practices, and we\u2019ve\ncommunicated them, with transparent, regular updates from leadership. These\npractices take practice, so we\u2019ve been building day-to-day habits around good\nhygiene, limiting travel, now. Because our product helps remote teams stay in\nsync and strengthen connections, we all know how to work from home because we\ndo it at least one day a week. Consider providing specific guidance for how\nteams and leaders can operate effectively when working remotely. Create a\ndocument detailing how teams should adjust their operations and try having\neveryone work remotely one day a week to develop the operating model. Build\nthe practice now to avoid painful fire drills later.\u201d\n\n[**Harrison Monarth**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonmonarth/) **,\nCEO,**[ **Gurumaker**](http://www.gurumaker.com)\n\n\"Frequent communication and simple guidance to help employees protect\nthemselves: Reminders on how to conduct oneself when sneezing or coughing:\nbest in a tissue and then discarding or into an elbow. NOT coughing or\nsneezing in hand as employees tend to forget to wash hands and then touch\ndoorknobs, copiers, etc., potentially infecting others. Washrooms stocked with\nhand sanitizers, paper towels, and soap.\u201d\n\n## **2\\. Leverage Remote Work to Continue Business as Usual**\n\n[**Alex Konanykhin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konanykhin/) **, CEO,**[\n**TransparentBusiness**](http://TransparentBusiness.com)\n\n\"HR has to be prepared to assure the smooth transition of the workforce to the\nwork-from-home scenario, should the pandemic make a daily commute to usual\nworkplaces impossible or unadvisable.\n\n\u201cMillions of people in China are banned from commuting to work. Remote work\nthere is no longer a matter of convenience or economic efficiency; it\u2019s\nliterally a matter of life and death. Unnecessary commute and congregating in\noffice buildings increase the rate of spread of the decease. However, managing\nremote workers blindly is notoriously inefficient, so HR must train their\nworkforce to use transparency solutions, which have become an essential\nelement of emergency preparedness and continuity of business.\u201d\n\n[**Jacqueline Anderson**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-\nanderson-b0116b3b/) **, HR director for APAC region,**[\n**Nintex**](http://www.nintex.com)\n\n**\u201cLeverage working from home:** Unlike many businesses, tech companies can\noperate using remote employees, so this is an excellent time to draw on this\ncapability. Ensure all employees are equipped to work from home and have met\nthe correct safety criteria to do so. This will show employees you support\nthem in their concerns about public transport travel and the closure of school\nand daycares and allows those who have been exposed to the virus, but aren\u2019t\nunwell, to work while in self-quarantine.\u201d\n\n**Learn more:**[ **6 Essential Remote Work Tools HR Needs to Deploy for\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/6-essential-\nremote-work-tools-hr-needs-to-deploy-for-2020/)\n\n**[Courtney Bigony](https://www.linkedin.com/in/courtneybigony/), director of\npeople science, [15Five](http://15five.com)**\n\n\u201cIt's HR's responsibility to leverage flexible work plans and not only allow\nbut encourage employees who may feel sick to work from home and take time off\nwithout retaliation or punishment. If you don't already have a flexible work\nfrom home policy, now is the time to create one. It's HR's responsibility to\nmake it as easy as possible for employees to stay home at the early signs of\nsickness without fear. In short, put in place structures that make it easy for\npeople to do the right thing. If you have these structures in place, then when\nsomething like Coronavirus hits, then moving remote shouldn\u2019t affect business\nas usual.\u201d\n\n[**Ben Christensen**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmchrist/) **, head of\npeople and talent,**[ **Handshake**](http://www.joinhandshake.com)\n\n\u201c1) If at all feasible, ask your employees to work from home. Social\ndistancing being put in place as early as possible can be key for helping slow\ndown the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201c2) Make sure your managers are set up for success in managing teams remotely,\nand you have a support system to make sure you\u2019re checking in on employees to\nmake sure they\u2019re safe and healthy. This is a quick guide we made for our\nmanagers when we made the choice to move to WFH and a guide we made for\nindividuals on expectations and best practices when working from home.\n\n\u201c3) There\u2019s a lot of information, uncertainty, and confusion. HR can play a\nkey role in helping employees make sense of all the information, and what this\nmeans for them and their family, leading to a happier, more comfortable, and\nsafe team. We are sending daily updates to our team letting them know about\nany changes to our policies or any other noteworthy news they may want to be\naware of.\n\n\u201c4) Take a look at what other companies are doing and build off the great work\nthat others have done. You don\u2019t need to figure it all out on your own.\u201d\n\n## **3\\. Reassess If Work Done by Each Team Can Be Paused, Re-located, or\nContinued**\n\n[**Ian Cook**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianjcook/) **, VP of people\nsolutions,**[ **Visier**](https://www.visier.com)\n\n\"HR's focus is on people. Pandemics and disasters massively affect people \u2013 HR\nis central to the planning and handling of these types of events. HR must\nbalance the needs of people with the need to keep business operations running.\n\n**\u201cTask 1** is to identify where people are and how likely they are to be\nexposed to and/ or impacted by the event.\n\n**\u201cTask 2** is to identify the work that is being done by this group and\ndetermine if it can be paused, re-located or continued with different\nenvironmental controls in place.\n\n\u201cFor example, one of our foodservice clients has already re-organized their\nshift structure and allocation of employees to reduce the risks to their\npeople.\n\n**\u201cTask 3** is to set, communicate and manage policy and work expectations for\nthe broader employee base. For example, when employees should stay at home or\ntravel.\u201d\n\n**Learn More:**[ **66% of Organizations Feel Prepared to Respond to the\nCoronavirus, Reports Paychex**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/workplace-\nwellness/66-of-organizations-feel-prepared-to-respond-to-the-coronavirus-\nreports-paychex/)\n\n## **4\\. Model an Approach to Problem Solving**\n\n[**Maggie Craddock**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maggiecraddock/) **,\nfounder, and president,**[ **Workplace\nRelationships**](http://workplacerelationships.com/)\n\n\u201cThis is the time to proactively address, at a human level, the challenges\nemployees may be battling internally as they strive to take effective actions\nexternally. Validating the needs of others protects resources that may be\ntough to quantify but priceless to your firm: loyalty, motivation, and\ncourage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also vital for employees at all levels to make sure that the messages\nthey are conveying and the actions they are taking are aligned as this crisis\nunfolds. Whenever we proffer a strategic plan, it\u2019s imperative to be able to\nexecute this in a manner that models an approach to problem-solving that\nsupports the firm\u2019s culture.\"\n\n## **5.** **Communication Must be Swift, Clear, and Supportive**\n\n[**Henry Albrecht**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henryalbrecht/) **, CEO, and\nfounder,**[ **Limeade**](https://www.limeade.com)\n\n\"Now is the time your people need you the most. Your communication and the\nactions you take must be swift, clear and supportive. Here are three things\nemployers can do right now to protect their workforce:\n\n**\u201cDynamic Communication:** Email is not useful in situations like this as not\nevery employee has access, and email does not open opportunities for two-way\ncommunication for all. Ensure your company has a bidirectional engagement\nsolution to communicate proactively and to help you react to feedback.\nAdminister small surveys frequently to gauge how your employees are feeling\nand identify shifts in attitude, so you can adjust accordingly.\n\n**\u201cShow Care:** Your employees should hear from you often, feel supported and\ncared for, and the overarching message must be crystal clear: stay home if you\nare sick; know the travel policies; employees have a right to protect\nthemselves and their teams from spreading illnesses.\n\n**\u201cAddress Policies:** Develop corporate policies to proactively address the\nspread of viruses. Your workforce must know what the company is doing, how\nyou\u2019re doing it, and when, in order to feel confident that any scenario has\nbeen accounted for, which will increase feelings of safety.\"\n\n[**Kandi Gongora**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kandigongora/) **, VP people,\nand organizational excellence,**[ **Goodway\nGroup**](https://www.goodwaygroup.com)  \n  \n\"You must communicate that you are monitoring the situation while also\neducating employees on how to protect themselves at home and at work. If you\ndon\u2019t allow remote work, this is the best time to test and work out any issues\nbefore the virus spreads. It isn\u2019t easy and there will be challenges. You will\nneed to monitor its effectiveness and the overall wellbeing of employees. This\nrequires planning and thoughtfulness, but if everyone keeps an open mind you\ncan keep employees safe and productive and come away with learnings on how to\ncontinue to provide flexible working environments.\"\n\n[**Jacqueline Anderson**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueline-\nanderson-b0116b3b/) **, HR director for APAC region,**[\n**Nintex**](http://www.nintex.com)\n\n\"HR\u2019s role is like that of any other business leader: understand the business\nimpact in all the regions you operate in; and communicate, educate and put the\ncorrect protective measures in place. HR leaders should understand the supply\nchain: Where are all your employees located and how are they affected? Tech is\nknown to outsource certain parts of their software development, so it\u2019s\nimportant to understand how those countries are handling the virus.\n\n**\u201cCreate safe and open dialogue:** If employees feel they may be vilified for\nbringing the virus into the office, they are unlikely to disclose they are\nunwell or have been exposed. Communicate common myths about the virus and\nexplain when and how they should notify their workplace. Reinforce that there\nwill be no repercussions for coming forward and their privacy will be treated\nwith the upmost respect. It is also critical to train front line managers on\nthe company\u2019s approach and what questions to ask their team.\n\n**\u201cHave a plan in the event of an office outbreak:** Consider how you will\ncommunicate the outbreak, including details like when employees will need to\nuse PTO and when to work from home. Be clear on strategic actions like whether\nyou\u2019ll separate the executive team and whether you can outsource area of work\nif a team that is key to the business becomes unwell.\"\n\n**Learn More:**[ **3 Low-Cost, High-Impact Internal Communication Tools for\nSmall Businesses**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/3-lowcost-highimpact-internal-communication-tools-for-small-\nbusinesses/)\n\n## **6.** **Make it Easy for Employees to Ask Questions via an Open-Door\nPolicy**\n\n[**Harrison Monarth**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrisonmonarth/) **,\nCEO,**[ **Gurumaker**](http://www.gurumaker.com)\n\n\u201cCreate a website or webpage on corporate website with FAQs that is updated\nabout the coronavirus or any other crisis employees are facing or worried\nabout. Frequent updates are key.\n\n\u201cAllowing employees to stay at home and/or work from home when they are not\ncomfortable at work or feeling ill. Make it easy to ask.\n\n\u201cRemember that uncertainty and fear are productivity killers, so have an open-\ndoor policy and make it easy for employees to ask questions that cannot be\nanswered on the FAQ webpage. The more forthcoming HR departments are with\ninformation, support in helping employees practice hygiene and safety, and the\nmore they can create an environment of transparency, the more employees will\nbe able to focus on the job during the chaos.\"\n\n**Learn More:**[ **HR\u2019s Critical Role in Emergency\nCommunications**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/hrs-critical-role-in-emergency-communications/)\n\n## **7.** **CHROs Must Provide Meaningful Input for Business Continuity\nPlanning**\n\n[**Umesh\nRamakrishnan**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umeshceokingsleygatepartners/) **,\nCEO,**[ **Kingsley Gate Partners**](http://www.kingsleygate.com)\n\n\u201cIn a health-based crisis, like the coronavirus pandemic, HR plays a\nsignificant role both in risk mitigation and operational control. As the world\nknows now, the most vulnerable populations are ones that have underlying\nconditions \u2013 conditions that are protected from disclosure due to privacy\nlaws. The only ones with access to that information are HR executives. They\nshould use this to direct leadership teams with resource allocation, location\ndecisions, and sick leave policy adjustments. In addition, they should lean\ninto modifying compensation structures temporarily to protect their employees\nin the long term. CEOs should depend on their CHROs to provide meaningful\ninput into business continuity planning and risk mitigation. They should also\nset up a communication channel with remote employees that have not had\nexperience working in such a manner to ensure that morale is kept up during\nthis trying time.

But is onboarding being\noverlooked as one of the key steps to retention, engagement, upskilling, and\nmost importantly, improved business outcomes and as a result, increased\nbusiness revenues? Yes, found a recent survey by SilkRoad Technology.\n\n[SilkRoad Technology](https://www.silkroad.com/), a provider of strategic\nonboarding and workforce provider solutions, announced the findings of a poll\ntitled [U.S. Trends and Applications in Employee\nOnboarding](https://hr1.silkroad.com/trends-employee-onboarding). The survey\nwas conducted over April and May 2019 among 203 HR decision-makers in the U.S.\nto assess where HR can direct their efforts to prepare the workforce for the\ncoming decade.\n\nThe findings? Onboarding was identified as one of the least leveraged events\nin the employee lifecycle, and an under-recognized contributor to the business\nbottom line.\n\nEnter \u2013 strategic onboarding, which does more than just introduce an employee\nto their new organization. It helps in the evolution of the employee into a\nstrategic resource for the organization.\n\n## **What Is Strategic Onboarding?**\n\nA step ahead from the conventional [employee\nonboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) process is strategic onboarding.\nIn contrast to its administrative counterpart, strategic onboarding continues\nthroughout an employee\u2019s lifecycle with an organization.\n\nIt involves more than just HR admin and takes place with a manager and the\nteam the employee will now be a part of. And most importantly, strategic\nonboarding involves helping employees upskill to keep evolving in their\npresent role as well as preparing them for future roles. All these events are\nstrategic touchpoints that define the continuous onboarding of an employee in\nan organization.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Do You Measure These 5 Onboarding\nMetrics?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-five-onboarding-metrics/)\n\n## **What Is the ROI of Strategic Onboarding?**\n\nIn an era where the very notion of work is being disrupted, strategic\nonboarding keeps employees engaged, and helps prepare them for an uncertain\n[future of work](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/5-essential-\nexpert-perspectives-about-the-future-of-work-in-2019/). But let\u2019s look\nspecifically at what the ROI of this process can be.\n\n### **1\\. Strategic onboarding is key to remaining relevant in the future**\n\n  \nIn an exclusive conversation with HR Technologist, Robert Dvorak, CEO of\nSilkRoad Technology said that onboarding is not just for new hires. It extends\nto the entire workforce.\n\nStressing the importance of continuous learning, he said, \u201cHR leaders must\nprepare their entire workforce \u2013 not just new hires \u2013 with the skills they\nneed, and continually \u2018onboard\u2019 them to new roles of business value and\nrelevance. These new skills include critical thinking, active learning and an\nagile mindset to build sustained relevancy to their organization and their\ncareer.\u201d\n\nIt appears that there is a lesser-known connection between onboarding and\n[upskilling the workforce](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/upskilling-the-workforce-amazon-upskilling-2025/). And Lilith\nChristiansen, VP of Onboarding Solutions at SilkRoad Technology, was of the\nsame opinion. \u201cMore than two-thirds of those surveyed say onboarding is\ntreated as a static event in their company. They are missing opportunities to\nsupport employees with continuous, intentional and personalized training that\nwill help them remain competitive and relevant throughout their careers.\u201d\n\n78% of HR decision-makers as identified in the U.S. Trends and Applications in\nEmployee Onboarding report agreed that onboarding is not just for new\nemployees. It should also include older employees. 70% said that their new\nemployee onboarding program lasted only three months or less.\n\n### **2\\. Strategic onboarding is key to preparing employees for an AI-driven\nfuture**\n\n  \nThe future of the workforce is AI-driven and there is no escaping it. In fact,\nas you may have seen, [AI is making several strides in\nHR](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/the-\nbeginners-guide-to-ai-in-hr/) as well. Yet fears about its application in the\nworkplace and how it might replace jobs abound. And though employees and HR\nmay say they are ready for this future, are they really?\n\nChristiansen says, \u201cDuring the next three to five years, businesses in every\nindustry are expected to experience massive disruption and opportunity through\nautomated, digital, AI and machine learning advances. The potential is huge\n(e.g. offloading work to algorithms, bots, and other tools), but it\u2019s also\nunnerving (\u2018what does that mean for me and my job?\u2019).\u201d\n\n[Research by Lighthouse Research and Advisory](http://lhra.io/blog/new-\nresearch-81-learning-pros-say-disruption-drives-upskilling-reskilling-demand/)\nconfirms this. 81% of employers are concerned about technological disruption\nchanging the skills that employees need to get the job done.\n\nTo handle these fears, Christiansen adds, \u201cCompanies need to navigate this new\nnormal and determine what to do first. They are struggling with how to prepare\nnew hires and legacy employees for jobs that don\u2019t exist. To do this, they\nmust first anticipate what skills employees will need to remain relevant and\ncompetitive, then determine how can onboarding fill these skills gap.\u201d\n\n### **3\\. Strategic onboarding keeps employees ahead in the upskilling game**\n\n  \nAnd being armed with skills of the future keeps the organization ahead and\nbetter prepared for the future. The survey found that 65% of HR decision-\nmakers said their company\u2019s onboarding program helps existing employees\nprepare for the next step in their career, but only 11% said their onboarding\nplan continues beyond the initial training period for new hires.\n\nThis indicates that a clear gap exists between onboarding and upskilling \u2013 a\nrelationship that is still not that evident to employers.\n\nChristiansen said that the way to remedy this is to \u201crecognize those moments\nin time that require new skills of an individual and utilizing strategy and\nonboarding to acknowledge those transitions.\u201d This, she says, will help\nemployees upskill in a way that increases their confidence in a new role.\n\n**Learn More:** **[10 Employee Onboarding Checklist Items You Can't Afford to\nMiss](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/employee-\nonboarding-checklist/)**\n\n## **Where Are the Bottlenecks in Implementing a Strategic Onboarding\nProgram?**\n\nThe SilkRoad research found that insufficient leadership support and poor\nengagement of front-line supervisors are the two areas where onboarding\nprograms fail to take off. \u201cResearch tells us that 70% of a person's\nsatisfaction on the job comes from their relationship with their direct\nsupervisor. Additionally, change management always fails when it lacks support\nfrom leadership,\u201d says Ben Eubanks, Principal Analyst at Lighthouse Research &\nAdvisory.\n\nHe continues, \u201cIn our advisory work with employers, we have seen a wide\nvariety of initiatives designed to revamp and change onboarding programs, and\nthose that fail tend to ignore the people component in favor of a pure\nprocess- or technology-focused approach.\u201d\n\nTechnology is always marketed as the solution to any problem HR may face. But\ntechnology is only an aid. Focusing more on technology solutions than the\npeople who will use it is one of the key reasons most [digital transformation\nstrategies fail](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/why-do-digital-transformation-strategies-fail-and-how-can-hr-\nhelp/) \u2013 and this includes onboarding. The users of the technology require an\nequal amount of \u2013 if not more \u2013 attention in any digital transformation\ninitiative.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **To Stop the Ghosting Epidemic, Upgrade Your\nOnboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/to-stop-the-ghosting-epidemic-upgrade-your-onboarding/)\n\n## **Want C-Suite Buy-in? Show Them the Revenue from and Cost of Continuous\nOnboarding**\n\nThe success of onboarding is often measured first in terms of employee\nengagement and then in terms of the value that an engaged employee can\neventually bring to an organization. And while that is the desired outcome of\nstrategic onboarding, a greater focus on more concrete outcomes will help you\nbuild your case.\n\nThe success of a sales pitch lies in its delivery, and successful delivery\nrelies on speaking to the things that matter the most to your audience.\n\nDvorak agrees and adds, \u201cHR leaders who want to capture C-suite attention and\nchampion the importance of a dynamic onboarding program should present the\nsignificance of continuous onboarding in the context of how it impacts\nrevenue, costs, and risk. For instance, they should bring data illustrating\nrevenue increases that occur when employees receive continuous training and\nare able to meet the evolving needs of their customers.\u201d\n\nLeadership needs to see the impact of onboarding automation and continuous\nonboarding in terms of revenue, the cost involved in implementation, and the\nrisks involved in revamping the onboarding program at the organization. These\nrisks may involve losing employees in spite of investing in their continuous\nonboarding and lack of adoption of onboarding measures you implement.\n\nOnly then are they likely to give you the nod for a more advanced onboarding\ninitiative.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Are Traditional HR Practices Holding Your Organization\nBack?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/are-\ntraditional-hr-practices-holding-your-organization-back/)\n\n## **The Next Steps for HR Decision-Makers**\n\n\u201cThe results of this survey paint a picture of a corporate environment that is\nnot using the full potential of its greatest assets \u2013 its people,\u201d said Dvorak\nwhen asked about the initiatives HR decision-makers and workforce managers\nshould take towards developing more strategic onboarding programs.\n\nHe recommends that HR begin by first looking at the current state of their\nonboarding programs and slowly incorporating the elements of upskilling into\nit. \u201cCompanies can prepare for the future now by beginning to take advantage\nof their people through onboarding, learning and performance programs for\nemployee development and training,\u201d Dvorak adds.\n\nBut continuous learning is a mutual effort, and employees must be sensitized\nto the intrinsic value of such learning and prepped to be prepared to learn\nthroughout their lifecycle with a company. This openness and awareness of the\nneed for learning is what will define the success of the learning program.\n\nAs a last piece of advice, Dvorak recommends, \u201cHR decision-makers and\nworkforce managers should also work together with the C-suite to create a plan\nto guide their workforce through these changes and redefine the roles and\ncosts of labor. CHRO, CFO, and CIO leaders can and should work together to\ncreate an elegantly designed and integrated \u2018AI and Human\u2019 operating model, if\nfor nothing but the competitive advantage it provides.\u201d\n\nQuite a few aspects of [employee onboarding can be\nautomated](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/4-reasons-to-automate-employee-onboarding/), so that\u2019s where you\ncan be freed up and use that time to build a more strategic approach to\nonboarding, which will benefit the organization and its employees over the\nshort, medium and long term.\n\n_Does your organization take a strategic approach to onboarding?

These functions that have been increasingly\nimplemented over the last couple of years are just scratching the surface of\nthe ways AI can transform and augment the HR industry.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that traditional ways of HR and internal relations are changing\nwith the emergence of new technologies. As the digital-native generation is\nrapidly moving into the workforce, the industry needs to make technical\nadjustments to better serve this generation of employees and employers. New\ntechnologies, such as AI, can further develop employee/manager relationships\nin ways that weren\u2019t possible many years ago.\n\nHere are a few ways that you can leverage AI to improve overall employee\nsatisfaction, employee retention and the relationship between employees and\ntheir managers.\n\n## **Address the Challenges of the Digital Age**\n\nThe digital age has pushed us to utilize new forms of communication in the\nworkplace. Whether it\u2019s emails, texts, or platforms like Slack, this presents\nnew challenges. There\u2019s a loss of context when communication more frequently\noccurs digitally than in person \u2013 it\u2019s a major hurdle associated with\ncommunication in this day and age.\n\nFace-to-face communication is becoming less common in the workplace due to the\nrise of remote work, coworking apps, and new technologies. It\u2019s important that\ncritical information or context of communications doesn\u2019t get lost in\ntranslation.\n\nDigital communications may cause management to fail to capture what employees\nare thinking, how they are feeling, and whether or not they have understood\nthe task at hand. According to Debra Hamilton\u2019s report, Top Ten Email Blunders\nThat Cost Companies Money, a company with 100 employees can expect to lose\napproximately $450,000 a year or more because of email blunders,\ninefficiencies, and misunderstandings.\n\nThis only covers mistakes with email communications. It\u2019s hard to imagine the\nnumber of daily misunderstandings and miscommunications that arise from other\ntypes of digital conversations. It\u2019s very easy to misconstrue someone\u2019s true\nfeelings and thoughts when consuming the message digitally.\n\nLuckily, AI can help us face these challenges and make communication a more\nstreamlined, effective, and mutual understanding between employees and\nmanagement.\n\n## **Analyze Employee Engagement**\n\nUtilizing the voice of the employee (VoE) analytics, which are driven by AI,\ncan improve how you monitor employee engagement and feedback, ultimately\nensuring better relationships between employees and their managers. Taking a\nstep back and analyzing how employees are feeling can lead to positive\nchanges. For example, you send out an employee survey to gauge attitudes\ntowards a new computer software your company is using. The feedback you\nreceive is that everyone is confused and frustrated with the platform. Easy\nfix! You host a training session to better educate employees on the platform\nand discuss any concerns or questions. In the end, everyone is feeling better\nabout the new platform and you\u2019ve proactively mitigated risks by taking the\ntime to analyze employee sentiment.\n\n**Learn More:[How AI in the Workplace Could Shorten Your\nWorkweek](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/ai-in-hr/how-ai-in-the-\nworkplace-could-shorten-your-workweek/)**\n\nBy implementing this type of AI, organizations have access to more data, which\nprovides managers with immediate and actionable feedback from their teams.\nWithout advancing technology and increased amounts of data available, this\ntype of engagement and leadership development wouldn\u2019t be as accessible.\n\nAI technologies that use a variety of natural language processing and textual\nanalysis can incite positive changes within key relationships at\norganizations. This can be especially useful in times of significant change,\nsuch as a major restructuring, new leadership or a new strategy.\n\n## **Increase Employee Retention**\n\nAccording to a Salesforce report, [The Impact of Equality and Values-Driven\nBusiness](https://www.salesforce.com/contents/sfdc/impact-of-equality.jsp),\nemployees who feel that their voices are heard at work are 4.5 times more\nlikely to be motivated to perform their best. Being able to provide employees\nwith this type of security and reassurance means they are more likely to be\nloyal to your organization.\n\nAI is an important function of employee retention. With more data to be\nanalyzed, employers can better understand how employees are feeling and gauge\nwhether or not they intend to stay with the organization. AI enables an\nemployer to identify employee\u2019s areas of dissatisfaction and the underlying\ncauses behind them.\n\n**Learn More:[2 Ways AI is Transforming Wellness in the\nWorkplace](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/2-ways-\nai-is-transforming-wellness-in-the-workplace/)**\n\nWhen management can act upon identified problems, they have a better chance of\nretaining employees and increasing satisfaction. These analytics are possible\nbecause of AI and give companies the power to better listen to their\nemployees. Even further, managers that can better understand their employees\u2019\nproblems, consider them, and execute based on employee feedback will improve\noverall key metrics within the company and increase employee retention rates.\n\nAI is inevitably going to continue to transform the HR industry. Certain\nconsiderations need to be taken into account for the rise of digital\ncommunication methods and the influx of digital natives making their way into\nthe workforce. The best way to adapt is to embrace AI and new technologies and\nuse them to your advantage. AI implementation in HR is positive \u2013 it leads to\nbetter communication, more secure employee/manager relationships, and aids in\nleadership development for managers.\n\n_Are you using AI at your workplace?

An essential but commonly overlooked component for securing\nthis favorable impression is onboarding - the process of integrating new\nemployees into an organization.\n\n**Why is onboarding so important?**  \nCompanies should never underestimate the significance of onboarding when\nhiring new employees. This is so because the process doesn't just benefit new\nhires; it benefits even old hires and company leaders alike. The process\noffers the following benefits, according to Strayboots:\n\n**Decreased new employee anxiety**  \nBeing a new hire can be stressful. However, employers can reduce that stress\nby providing new hires with all the information they need to fulfill their\nroles. A strong onboarding process results in much happier employees and helps\npeople discover how their roles fit in with the rest of the company's\nworkforce. It facilitates the building of relationships, resulting in\nfriendships that are an essential element of happy working life.\n\nReducing new employee stress starts right at the beginning of the onboarding\nprocess, during orientation. Orientation days give new hires a first\nimpression of the company and an idea of what they can expect working there.\nThus, these days should be celebratory, welcoming, and informative.\n\n**Increased productivity**  \nAs new employees go through the onboarding process, they quickly get along\nwith the employees who have been with the company for longer periods. It lets\nthem reach higher productivity levels much faster than if they had to figure\nthings out on their own. Through onboarding, companies enjoy 54% greater\nproductivity from their new hires.\n\nHowever, without onboarding, it takes around eight to 12 months for new\nemployees to reach their full productivity levels, which can result in losses\nof 1% to 2.5% of a business's total revenue.\n\n**Reduced employee turnover**  \nOnboarding is a great start for developing employee engagement. It helps\nintroduce new employees to the company and engage them with the company's\nvalues. If they are engaged, they are much less likely to leave an\norganization to look for one that better fits their work culture. Studies show\nthat 87% of employees are less likely to leave a company when they are engaged\nworkers.\n\n**How long should onboarding take?**  \nMost companies spend only two months or less on the onboarding process, and a\nfraction of these don't include any training for the new hires. However, the\nlongest onboarding programs are the most successful ones.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637215071772967347.jpg)](/ca/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218861)\n\n#### [Awkward 'mistake' on video call goes viral](/ca/news/general/awkward-\nmistake-on-video-call-goes-viral/218861)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637213360039891507.jpg)](/ca/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218598)\n\n#### [COVID-19: HR's main challenges revealed](/ca/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218598)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637214460857116193.jpg)](/ca/specialization/employee-\nengagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-worklife-balance/218773)\n\n#### [Fun Friday: 5 TED Talks on work/life\nbalance](/ca/specialization/employee-engagement/fun-friday-5-ted-talks-on-\nworklife-balance/218773)\n\nThe best onboarding processes last from six months to a whole year. It's\nbecause 90% of employees decide if they will stay with a company within their\nfirst six months of work. Continuous training and engagement during this time\nwill help employees feel at home in the company. After the critical six-month\nperiod, new employees need to see that they made the right decision. It's\nwhere onboarding shifts from a training approach to one encouraging continuous\ndevelopment, according to Strayboots.\n\n**What is the best employee onboarding process?**  \nFollowing steps based on best practices will help you design an [effective\nonboarding process](https://www.hcamag.com/us/specialization/employee-\nengagement/5-steps-for-an-effective-onboarding-process/178251) within your\norganization. CPS HR Consulting shared the steps that you should take:\n\n**Assemble a team**  \nThis team should be comprised of employees with varied perspectives on the\nonboarding process. It should include members from HR, leadership, and\nmanagement, especially those who have a genuine interest in improving your\ncurrent process. Include also recently hired employees, who will provide you\nwith insights into their onboarding experience.\n\n**Determine the \"what, how, who, and when\"**  \nWhat: Start with a brainstorming session in which you solicit everyone's ideas\nas to what information and activities are essential for your new hires to\nsucceed. Consider surveying employees hired within the past year or so to find\nout what was helpful, what was unnecessary (or shared with them too soon), and\nwhat additional information or activities would have helped them come up to\nspeed more quickly.\n\nThe content of your onboarding program will be unique to your organization.\nHowever, there are some standard items that you should consider, including:\n\n  * Your organization's mission, vision, and values\n  * Purpose of the unit\n  * Colleagues' names and their specific assignments/responsibilities\n  * What to expect on the first day\n  * Computer and phone set-up\n  * Systems and security access\n  * Employee preferences list\n  * Employee benefits training\n  * Sexual harassment prevention training\n\n**How:** Determine the optimal delivery method for each segment of your\nonboarding program. Use a variety of methods so that your new employees aren't\noverwhelmed by memos, informational sheets, forms to be completed, and\npolicies to read.\n\n**Who:** Decide about who is the most appropriate person to provide the\ninformation or perform the task. Not everything should be assigned to HR or\nthe supervisor. Consider who the experts are on the various topics and how\neffectively they can share the information.\n\n**When:** Consider breaking the onboarding time into five phases: before day\none, day one, first week, first month, and first six months. This part\nrequires discipline, as the tendency is to want to share too much, too soon.\nIt's important not to overwhelm the new employee with large project loads too\nquickly.\n\n**Implement**  \nMaking a checklist that lays out all the steps from start to finish, who needs\nto complete which step, and when the steps need to be completed is necessary\nfor effective implementation. This checklist should be an easy-to-use tool to\nassist managers, supervisors, and HR with onboarding new hires in a high-pace\nwork environment. Supplement the checklist with an automated system to set\nreminders and create an accountability system.\n\n**Assess**  \nOrganizations - and the individuals within them - are constantly evolving. For\nthis reason, onboarding practices should be evaluated to ensure that they\nremain effective for the new hire and those involved in executing the program.\nThe most effective way to do this is to seek feedback from those involved at\nthe various checkpoints in the process.\n\n**How do you evaluate your onboarding process?**  \nConsider conducting an onboarding evaluation survey that new hires will answer\nafter their first six months. The survey should ask questions that evaluate\neach phase of the onboarding process - even beginning with the application\nprocess. You can ask questions starting from how they heard about your company\nbefore they got hired to how they found your onboarding process. Exercise\ncaution to ensure that the questions are worded clearly and concisely.\n\nIf possible, make the survey and its results anonymous, as this will help\ngather honest and objective feedback from the new hires. However, not all\norganizations hire enough employees year-round to maintain a completely\nanonymous survey. One way to address this obstacle would be for a senior HR\nemployee, manager, or director to hold a one-on-one meeting with the new hire\nto ask the questions that would have been in the survey.

Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement. [Find out more about the webinars\n\u00bb](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\n\n[\u95b1\u8b80\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u672c](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/?p=120581&preview=true)\n\nThis year, the unemployment rate in Hong Kong reached a 20-year low of 2.8%.\nThis figure shows that the ability for organisations to retain top talent will\nonly intensify.\n\n[One report](https://www.conference-board.org/c-suite-challenge2018) suggests\nthat employee retention is the number one issue for HR professionals and CEOs.\nAnd yet, companies often spend very little time onboarding new hires. With\naround 20% of staff turnover occurring within the first 45 days of employment,\nan effective onboarding process is crucial.\n\n**Here are some realistic onboarding strategies to help improve your employee\nretention.**\n\n**_Organisational onboarding_**\n\n**Teach your new hires how things work.** The first part of onboarding is\nalerting new employees to the information they need to perform on a daily\nbasis: where to get an ID card, how to navigate the building, how to enrol in\nthe company\u2019s MPF programme. It\u2019s also essential to teach them your workplace\nlanguage and acronyms \u2013 deciphering them can be a distressing mystery for new\nhires.\n\n**Help new hires assimilate.** Companies must be intentional in helping new\nhires adapt to the company\u2019s values and norms, especially during the first 12\nmonths.\n\nAt regular intervals, say three, six, and nine months, HR should formally\ninvolve new hires in conversations about the company\u2019s history and brand, and\nhow performance is measured and rewarded.\n\n**_Technical onboarding_**\n\n**Define what good looks like.** Provide your new hire with a job description\nthat includes well-defined accountabilities and any boundaries around the\nleadership or available resources they should be aware of.\n\n**Set up early wins.** Giving new hires clear goals is a powerful strategy\nbecause it allows you to share realistic expectations.\n\nSurprisingly, [60% of companies](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/getting-\nnew-hires-up-to-speed-quickly/) revealed they did not set short-term goals for\nnew hires. A good way to begin is to assign tasks with an expectation they be\ncompleted within a clearly defined and realistic time frame. Start with\ntargets you are confident your new hires can meet. Then, if all goes well,\ngradually increase the level of responsibility associated with each task.\n\n**_Social onboarding_**\n\n**Build a sense of community.** Building relationships during the new hire\u2019s\nfirst year can help them feel less isolated and more confident.

chosen Dr. Chad Teague to serve as its new Chief Human\nResources Officer. The MISD Board of Trustees approved the hire during a\nspecial session held on Monday.\n\nTeague brings 25 years of expertise gleaned over the course of a career that\nhas led him from the classroom to campus leadership to the top levels of\ndistrict administration. He comes to MISD from Little Elm ISD, where he has\nmost recently served as the executive director of human resources.\n\nAmong his accomplishments in Little Elm, Teague updated the district\u2019s salary\nand compensation plan and streamlined their recruiting, application and\nonboarding processes during a time of district growth and expansion.\n\nHe\u2019ll be a familiar face in MISD, having served in MISD\u2019s human resources\ndepartment from 2015\u20132019.\n\n\u201cMISD has a tradition of hiring some of the best and the brightest minds in\nthe field of educational administration,\u201d said MISD Superintendent Dr. Rick\nMcDaniel. \u201cWithout question, Dr. Chad Teague will add to that long list of\nquality professionals, and I am pleased that he has returned to lead the MISD\nhuman resources department. He will undoubtedly be well received, as he had an\nexcellent reputation across the district during his previous tenure here. I\nlook forward to seeing the human resources department continue to perform at a\nhigh level under his leadership.\u201d\n\nTeague began his career in 1995 as a seventh grade English teacher in Keller\nISD. In 1998, he moved into campus leadership as a middle school assistant\nprincipal in Coppell ISD and four years later, accepted a job as principal of\nCedar Creek Middle School in Bastrop ISD. Beginning in 2005, he served at the\nhigh school level as an assistant principal in Katy ISD before he made the\nmove to human resources with Lewisville ISD in 2012.\n\nHe came to MISD in 2015 to serve as director of human resources where his\nresponsibilities included family medical leave, benefits, recruitment and\nretention and employee background checks, among other vital responsibilities.\n\nTeague has been a regular presenter at professional conferences, most recently\npresenting for the Texas Association of School Personnel Administrators in\n2017 and the American Association of School Personnel Administrators in 2018.\n\n\u201cI am excited to return to McKinney ISD and provide support and leadership for\nour teachers, administrators and employees,\u201d said Teague. \u201cMcKinney is a great\nplace to work and live, and I am looking forward to continuing the traditions\nand expectations for excellence the district and community have created.\u201d\n\nTeague earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in English and his master\u2019s degree in\neducation administration from the University of Texas at Arlington and his\ndoctorate in administration and supervision from the University of Houston.\n\n _Shane Mauldin is the MISD communications coordinator._\n\nYou must be logged in to react.  \nClick any reaction to login.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\n  * [ __ Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstarlocalmedia.com%2Fmckinneycouriergazette%2Fnews%2Fmckinney-isd-hires-new-chief-hr-officer%2Farticle_8bdbc42e-78e1-11ea-abc3-a3ee8feb1869.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Share on Facebook\")\n  * [ __ Twitter ](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&text=McKinney%20ISD%20hires%20new%20chief%20HR%20officer&via=CourierGazette&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstarlocalmedia.com%2Fmckinneycouriergazette%2Fnews%2Fmckinney-isd-hires-new-chief-hr-officer%2Farticle_8bdbc42e-78e1-11ea-abc3-a3ee8feb1869.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Tweet\")\n  * [ __ WhatsApp ](https://wa.me/?text=https://starlocalmedia.com/mckinneycouriergazette/news/mckinney-isd-hires-new-chief-hr-officer/article_8bdbc42e-78e1-11ea-abc3-a3ee8feb1869.html \"WhatsApp\")\n  * [ __ SMS ](sms:?body=Check%20out%20this%20link:%20starlocalmedia.com/tncms/asset/editorial/8bdbc42e-78e1-11ea-abc3-a3ee8feb1869 \"SMS\")\n  * [ __ Email ](mailto:?subject=%5BStar%20Local%20Media%5D%20McKinney%20ISD%20hires%20new%20chief%20HR%20officer&body=https%3A%2F%2Fstarlocalmedia.com%2Fmckinneycouriergazette%2Fnews%2Fmckinney-isd-hires-new-chief-hr-officer%2Farticle_8bdbc42e-78e1-11ea-abc3-a3ee8feb1869.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share \"Email\")\n  * [ __ Print ](javascript:window.print\\(\\) \"Print\")\n  * __ Save\n\n#### Tags\n\n  * [Chad Teague](/search/?k=%22chad%20teague%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Misd Board Of Trustees](/search/?k=%22misd%20board%20of%20trustees%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Work](/search/?k=%22work%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Human Resources](/search/?k=%22human%20resources%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Bastrop Isd](/search/?k=%22bastrop%20isd%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Administration](/search/?k=%22administration%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Master's Degree](/search/?k=%22master%27s%20degree%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n  * [Officer](/search/?k=%22officer%22#tncms-source=keyword)\n\n###  Recommended for you\n\n__Load comments\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Post a comment as\n\nEmoticons\n\n  * [smile]\n  * [beam]\n  * [wink]\n  * [sad]\n  * [cool]\n  * [innocent]\n  * [rolleyes]\n  * [whistling]\n  * [lol]\n  * [huh]\n  * [tongue]\n  * [love]\n  * [sleeping]\n  * [yawn]\n  * [unsure]\n  * [angry]\n  * [blink]\n  * [crying]\n  * [ohmy]\n  * [scared]\n  * [sleep]\n  * [sneaky]\n  * [tongue_smile]\n  * [thumbdown]\n  * [thumbup]\n  * [censored]\n  * [happybirthday]\n  * [ban]\n  * [spam]\n  * [offtopic]\n  * [batman]\n  * [ninja]\n  * [pirate]\n  * [alien]\n\nComment Text\n\nCancel\n\nPost comment\n\n\u00d7\n\nYour comment has been submitted.\n\n__\n\n![]()\n\n****\n\n\u00d7\n\n#### Report\n\nCancel\n\nReport Abuse\n\n\u00d7\n\nReported\n\n\u00d7\n\nThere was a problem reporting this.\n\n\u00d7\n\n####  Watch this discussion.

has caused cannabis businesses to face layoffs,\nincreasing exposure to EPL claims. Reduce your business\u2019 risk with these 4\nbest practices.\n\n### Share this:\n\n  * [Facebook](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/feature_article/heightened-epl-exposure-hits-cannabis-businesses-when-laying-off-employees/?share=facebook \"Click to share on Facebook\")\n  * [LinkedIn](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/feature_article/heightened-epl-exposure-hits-cannabis-businesses-when-laying-off-employees/?share=linkedin \"Click to share on LinkedIn\")\n  * [Twitter](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/feature_article/heightened-epl-exposure-hits-cannabis-businesses-when-laying-off-employees/?share=twitter \"Click to share on Twitter\")\n  * [Google](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/feature_article/heightened-epl-exposure-hits-cannabis-businesses-when-laying-off-employees/?share=google-plus-1 \"Click to share on Google+\")\n  * [Email](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/feature_article/heightened-epl-exposure-hits-cannabis-businesses-when-laying-off-employees/?share=email \"Click to email this to a friend\")\n  * \n\nEven though it\u2019s valued at more than $15 billion, the burgeoning global\ncannabis industry has experienced recent layoffs. By the end of 2019, more\nthan 600 cannabis employees got pink slips. Industry experts expect more of\nthe same in 2020 as investigations, lawsuits and slumping valuations plague\nthe industry.\n\nUnfortunately for employers, layoffs are where the issues begin - not end.\nEspecially for those without established policies and procedures. Without\nrules and regulations governing employment practices, business owners and\noperators are at considerable risk.\n\nThe 11 states where cannabis is legal for recreational use and the 33 where\nit\u2019s medically legal tend to have more onerous employment practices liability\n(EPL) laws, where liability is often assumed by the employer for mistakes like\npoorly handled layoffs. This is further compounded by the fact that HR\ndepartments at fledgling cannabis companies tend to be small or non-existent\nand often ill prepared to deal with the legalities that come with termination.\n\nEnsuring the right practices are in place prior to any layoffs is critical. Is\nyour company facing employee terminations? Are you knowledgeable of how to\nhandle it? Consider the following best practices:\n\n  1. **Document problematic employees.** Create a folder for each employee and document the details when problematic situations escalate to the point they need to be addressed. Should employees of a protected class engage in an EEOC, class action or personal lawsuit after they\u2019re terminated, you\u2019ll need this documentation to support your actions.\n  2. **Create a formal termination procedure.** Make sure the procedure includes well-thought-out details of your review process, including how employee performance is evaluated and what happens when those standards aren\u2019t met. Spell out which behaviors are grounds for dismissal. When talking to the employee about a termination, have another employee or manager in the room to avoid claims of mishandling later on, typically their direct manager, someone from HR or your in-house attorney. Determine how the distribution of final compensation such as medical insurance or PTO will be handled so you\u2019re prepared to answer those questions. These procedures should be spelled out in an employee handbook given to all at onboarding so there are no surprises.\n  3. **Retain a qualified EPL attorney.** Create a relationship with a qualified EPL attorney (not your cousin who does divorce law) to help you set policies and procedures initially and to consult with when a unique or particularly difficult situation arises.\n  4. **Get the right EPL coverage.** An EPL policy will defend a business from claims of breach of employment contraction, negligent evaluation, failure to employ or promote, wrongful termination, deprivation of career opportunity and mismanagement of employee benefits plans. Your EPL coverage will be determined by your location, clientele, employee profile and what you see as your biggest risks. When discussing the policy with your broker, weigh the following considerations to EPL coverage: \n    * Reimbursement coverage versus pay on behalf. Should the policy pay your defense costs directly, or will you lay out the money and they\u2019ll reimburse?\n    * The definition of a claim and wrongful act will be different for each EPL policy.\n    * EPL policy\u2019s limit structure. Do you want defense limits to be outside or inside the coverage?\n\nHaving to lay off employees is never an easy choice for an employer. Make sure\nyou and your business do everything right before and during the process so\nthat the aftermath isn\u2019t even more difficult, filled with lawsuits and\nliability claims.\n\n### Share

Your new hires see the entire operation as a single set of\nevents, and so should your organization. Tying recruiting and onboarding\ncloser together saves resources and increases retention.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nThis is true whether you are a company hiring directly or a staffing agency\nplacing temporary and contract workers. While the recruiting and onboarding\nfunctions are often held by different people in an organization, there are\nways to meld them more closely, through technology and processes, to help\nstaffing firms and hiring professionals improve their effectiveness.\n\n## **Traditional Recruiting and the Handoff**\n\nOnboarding is often practiced as a separate function from the recruiting and\nhiring process, due to the different tasks involved. This may be less true in\nthe temporary staffing world but is still an important reminder when handling\nthe hiring lifecycle from start to finish.\n\nThe best way to think of this is to consider the [candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/);\nwhether with a direct employer or staffing agency, a jobseeker\u2019s adventure is,\nfrom their point of view, singular, not a segmented group of barely-linked\nepisodes. Recruiting professionals of all types should keep that in mind when\ndesigning the experience. Questions an organization should ask include:\n\n  * Is our new hire experience consistently high-quality? If not, is the transition from hiring to onboarding a weak point in the process?\n  * How can we get the people involved in the recruiting and onboarding processes to work more closely together than they already do?\n  * What technology can we use to make sure that the candidate experience is seamless, from communications to onboarding documents such as employment contracts and payroll forms?\n\n##  \n**Why integrate onboarding?**\n\nAt Bullhorn, we have found that a high-quality [onboarding\nprocess](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-\nis-new-employee-onboarding/) can reduce new hire onboarding time by 60\npercent. This time savings translates to financial savings as well; when firms\nbetter integrate the hiring and onboarding processes, they can increase their\ngross margins through increased efficiency. Paperwork savings realized through\nan integrated process also translates monetarily.\n\nMore importantly, maintaining relationships through every part of the hiring\nand onboarding process is everything to a recruiting organization. Break these\nrelationships and you not only have a bad experience for the candidate, but\nthey are likely to tell everyone they know about their negative encounter,\nfurther compounding potential recruiting difficulties. Stated as a benefit:\nthe better the candidate experience, the happier the employee, and the longer\nthey stay, reducing talent acquisition costs through retention. This is true\nfor temporary staffing agencies, as contract employees return for additional\nengagements, as well as for corporations hiring directly.\n\n**Learn more:[How Great Onboarding Can Provide Certainty For Uncertain\nEmployees](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-\ngreat-onboarding-can-provide-certainty-for-uncertain-employees/)**\n\n## **People and technology make the relationship between recruiting and\nonboarding closer**\n\n**_Coordinate and integrate staff:_** While you may have different people\nperforming separate tasks for the phases of the hiring and onboarding\nprocesses, that does not mean they need to operate as siloed teams. How does\nyour organization collaborate? Are the functions merged departmentally, or is\nthere regular coordination as part of the process? The better your\norganizational coordination, the better the candidate experience.\n\n**_Integrate your ATS and onboarding technology:_** Traditionally, there has\nbeen a meaningful gap between solutions for applicant tracking and those for\nonboarding paperwork and communications. Again, thinking of the candidate as a\nsingle person can help staffing agencies and companies manage the process,\nstart to finish, as one. In this case, tying the supporting technology\ntogether - preferably in a single platform - makes for easy handoff of\ncandidate information, allows for faster communications such as email, and\nprevents time-hogging problems such as duplicated form-filling.\n\nUsing a platform that merges ATS and onboarding functions also helps\nrecruiters spend more time on the human side of their work\n\nStaffing organizations and hiring organizations have an opportunity to improve\ntheir operations by thinking of the candidate's experience as one event, from\nrecruiting to onboarding. Through a combination of organizational and\ntechnological coordination, recruiting professionals can make their jobs\neasier while making the candidates\u2019 experience seamless and positive,\nincreasing savings in time, financial, and replacement costs.\n\n**Learn more:[You've Recruited the Best Candidates: Here's How to Keep\nThem](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/youve-\nrecruited-the-best-candidates-heres-how-to-keep-them/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fhow-to-strengthen-the-relationship-between-recruiting-and-\nonboarding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=How+to+Strengthen+the+Relationship+Between+Recruiting+and+Onboarding\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=How+to+Strengthen+the+Relationship+Between+Recruiting+and+Onboarding&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fhow-to-strengthen-the-relationship-between-recruiting-and-\nonboarding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fhow-to-strengthen-the-relationship-between-recruiting-and-\nonboarding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fhow-to-strengthen-the-relationship-between-recruiting-and-\nonboarding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=How to Strengthen the Relationship Between\nRecruiting and\nOnboarding&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fhow-to-strengthen-the-relationship-between-recruiting-and-\nonboarding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

And they need to identify specific\nfunctional areas where digital solutions can help augment and improve outdated\nprocesses.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834bf8d52f2.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n[Employee onboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) is one of the areas where\ntransformation strategies can play an immediate and impactful role on\nengagement and productivity. According to Gallup, [only 12% of employees\nstrongly agree](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-\nworkplace-report-2017.aspx) that their organization does a great job\nonboarding new employees. Yet onboarding is the first step toward delivering\nan effective employee experience \u2014 and in the absence of it, many employees\ndon\u2019t stick around. Poorly designed onboarding processes are one of the\nreasons more than one-quarter of new employees [quit within 90\ndays](https://www.inc.com/adam-robinson/3-common-mistakes-that-make-new-\nemployees-want-to-quit-in-first-3-months.html).\n\n## The shortcomings of traditional onboarding\n\nOnboarding is perhaps the most overlooked element of a successful employee\njourney. For companies, clear, direct, and streamlined onboarding processes\nenable them to set employees up for success and optimal productivity. And on\nthe employee end, a seamless onboarding process gives them the confidence\nthey\u2019ve made the right career choice and helps establish their engagement and\nloyalty for the long term. It also helps them become a valuable contributor,\nearlier.\n\nPaper-based processes are one of the key areas in which onboarding remains\nplanted firmly in the past. Despite the rate at which enterprises have\nreplaced paper with digital tools in almost every other area, stacks of forms\nand paper-based corporate manuals and approval processes remain an onboarding\nmainstay.\n\nWhy? The challenges with this paper reliance are twofold: First, it removes\ncolleagues and managers from the picture and makes the process feel\nimpersonal. Second, employees likely won\u2019t engage with the materials, since\nthey\u2019ll be too overwhelmed by the volume of paper dumped on their desk on day\none. This lack of engagement at the outset sets a bad precedent for longer-\nterm loyalty.\n\nAnother issue we\u2019ve noticed with onboarding processes is a lack of interactive\nand role-applicable tasks. Almost all employees begin a job eager to prove\ntheir value and excited to help their team. Why, then, do so many enterprises\ndeny them that opportunity and instead put them through weeks of largely\nisolated learning, when people prefer to learn by doing and interacting with\ntheir teammates?\n\nAlso Read: **[10 Employee Onboarding Checklist Items You Can't Afford to\nMiss](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/employee-\nonboarding-checklist/)**\n\n## Designing a digitally driven onboarding process\n\nHere are some of our recommendations for how enterprises can implement a\ndigital employee onboarding process in the workplace that addresses some of\nthe aforementioned issues:  \n\n  * **Prioritize human-centered design:** Too often, onboarding is a top-down directive planned and rolled out by corporate leaders without the input of employees. Instead, companies should begin their digital onboarding planning by talking to the people most qualified to speak to the state of onboarding at the business: Those who\u2019ve recently experienced it and those who support it. By internally auditing your existing onboarding functions \u2014 through direct and candid engagement with employees \u2014 HR decision makers can quickly identify overly time-consuming and manual processes, areas that lack engagement, and key elements to improve.  \n  \nThis outside-in approach that listens and learns from the voice of the\nemployees, develops employee personas and explores employee onboarding\njourneys, is a key part of [human-centered\ndesign](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-workplace/how-human-centered-design-\nhelps-build-a-digital-workplace-that-works/) \u2014 the proven concept that bottom-\nup, experience-driven solutions yield the best results. When a large non-\nprofit medical association launched a digital transformation effort, for\nexample, it began by creating an organization-wide survey to understand\nperceptions about and usefulness of the current workplace. The team then did\ndetailed interviews and workshops with a diverse cross-section of employees to\ncreate four user personas which highlighted the motivations, behaviors,\ninteractions, needs, and goals of typical employees engaging with the company\nintranet. Using human-centered design, rapid prototyping frameworks and lean-\nagile product development principles, the association and West Monroe designed\nthe intranet-based digital workplace, meeting an array of user demands and\npositioning the association for success.  \n\n  * **Find the right digital tools:** Once HR and other enterprise leaders have engaged with their employees to identify areas for improvement, it\u2019s time to overhaul the onboarding process with digital tools that engage and empower new employees. When it comes to finding the best solutions for your onboarding needs, it can be helpful to work with outside experts to envision, conceive and build a process that integrates the most tailored tools. When you hire new employees, you need to quickly bring them up to speed on the latest projects, provide access to current project documents and introduce them to key stakeholders and their team members.  \n  \nThrough Microsoft Teams, new employees can immediately have access to past\nconversations and documents, or use chat, audio or video calling features to\nask questions about the projects. The employee self-service bot within\nMicrosoft Teams reduces the time employees spend searching for information to\nget their job done. Through this bot, new employees can access HR policies and\nprocesses like leave, benefits, and payroll via chat.  \n\n  * **Accept onboarding as a continuous process:** For business purposes, it\u2019s tidiest to think of onboarding as a process that occurs over a set period of time and then ends. But that\u2019s not a recipe for employee happiness or retention. Here at West Monroe, we see onboarding as a continuous process \u2014 and as a result, asking employees about their new hire experiences after their first week and then again after 90 days helps us learn things that matter to new hires. Organizations can leverage Office 365 Workplace analytics and MyAnalytics to help individuals and teams build better collaboration habits and strategies to improve engagement. Your training and new learnings never stop, whether you\u2019re an entry-level employee or a member of the C-suite.

a recent case study detailing what worked and what didn\u2019t, Dee Vitale,\ndirector of talent acquisition at Sage Therapeutics in Cambridge, MA, shares\nhow her company repaired an ineffective onboarding program:_\n\nIt's no secret that [onboarding](https://www.hrmorning.com/onboarding/) often\ngets overlooked and lumped together with a new hire's orientation.\n\nOnboarding programs often fail because there's no real accountability and no\none in charge of them. Too often, it's viewed as a \"check the box\" item and\nnothing more.\n\nWith this in mind, we took a closer look at our onboarding process and saw\nsome issues.\n\nThe first was that many existing employees didn't have a ton of knowledge\nabout the company in general or the role they played in the grand scheme of\nthings.\n\nAnother problem was that new hires' managers were often in charge of their\nonboarding \u2026 but weren't sure what to do.\n\n## 3 key elements\n\nTo address this, HR got together and designed a completely new framework for\nonboarding.\n\nWe really focused on ensuring the process extended far past first day\norientation, and involved everyone in the company -- not just new employees.\n\nWe came up with three key elements of our new program:\n\n    1. **New-hire orientation** : This is typical [first day](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/onboarding-2019/) information for new hires, including an official welcome and a rundown of basic company operations.\n    2.  **Department-level onboarding** : This is where new hires meet their colleagues, learn how their department contributes to the company's overall success and understand how the team operates.\n    3.  **All Aboard** : This event is for every employee to attend. New hires and veteran employees get to mix and mingle in a natural setting. It's a great way for people to meet higher-ups they don't run into every day.\n\n## Trained our leaders\n\nOnce we had a solid plan that everyone could follow, we got managers and\nleaders involved -- because it truly does take a village to successfully\nonboard new hires.\n\nWe let managers know that while we designed the process, they were the ones\nwho'd run it and be held accountable.\n\nNot every manager initially felt up to the challenge, so we developed a\nspecial leadership training program for them.\n\nThe training reinforced basic management fundamentals, directed participants\nto resources and tools, and sharpened leadership skills.\n\n## The big picture\n\nThanks to our revamp, both new and veteran employees are more engaged and\nhappier.\n\nNew hires learn about their role in the company from the start, and current\nemployees are reminded of how important they are to us.\n\nThose who attend our All Aboard events constantly tell us how much they\nenjoyed meeting colleagues they don't normally run into, and learning more\nabout the company's history and core values.\n\nEveryone knows how they fit into the big picture now, and they're all [better\nemployees](https://www.hrmorning.com/product/onboarding-that-optimizes-\nretention/) because of it.\n\n![Rachel\nMucha](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Rachel\nMucha](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Rachel\nMucha](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/RachelMucha.png)\n\n[Rachel Mucha](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/rmucha/)\n\nRachel writes about Human Resource management and has been a member of the\nHRMorning staff since 2017.

By now, you've likely witnessed someone's pet, kid, significant other\nor loud neighbor interrupt a work call. Maybe you've even been that person\nyourself.\n\nThe good news? You're not alone. We're all juggling distractions \u2013 and some\nare harder to keep at bay than others. Here are a few funny stories of virtual\ncalls that have taken a turn for the worst that will, hopefully, make you feel\nbetter about your own cringe-inducing moments.\n\n## 1\\. Kissing caught on camera\n\n\"Last week, I was on a web call with my COO talking about whether or not we're\nall completely equipped to work from home,\" says Director of Pricing Joe\nSchmitt.\n\n\"During the call, my dog jumped up on my lap and destroyed my face with\nkisses. I have a 64-pound pit bull.\"\n\n## 2\\. A tiny terrorizer\n\nWorking from home with an infant comes with benefits and challenges.\n\nOn one hand, HR professional Stephanie Perez has been able to cheer up her\ncoworkers with her daughter\u2019s special appearances on conference calls. \"I\nusually put her on my lap because it brightens up my coworker's days when we\nall bring a kid or pet \u2013 and I\u2019m the only one with a baby on my team,\" she\nsays.\n\nHowever, there have been a few embarrassing instances. \"She peed on me during\na Zoom happy hour,\" says Perez.\n\n\"She also took my earring off and tried to chew on it during a work Skype\nconference \u2013 and tried to bite my boob through my shirt in the middle of a\ncall!\"\n\n## 3\\. Schooled on feline bowel movements\n\n\"A teacher I supervise answered her house phone while we were on a Google Meet\nand refused to mute it,\" says Michael Rogers, a teacher based on Long Island.\n\n\"We all heard her pick up the phone call from her veterinarian\u2026and heard all\nthe details about how she was dealing with her cat\u2019s diarrhea.\"\n\n## 4\\. Technical difficulty for dad\n\n\"Recently, I was asked with some onboarding training sessions,\" says Spencer\nWaldron, Head of Remote Communications at [Prezi](https://prezi.com/). \"I was\nnervous about it because I've never done onboarding calls before, and I was\nabout to do one with someone from one of our key partners. Before the video\ncall starts I say, even plead, to both of my children, \u2018Daddy is about to go\non an important call -- please don't come into the room or make too much noise\nfor the next 30 minutes.\u2019\"\n\n\"I start the call, and then I suddenly see my youngest son appear on the\nscreen behind me, iPad in hand, asking for the passcode to open it,\" Waldron\ncontinues. \"I decide it\u2019s quickest to let him have the code. As I do this, the\niPad wakes up and loud rap music starts playing and I can't stop it, so I need\nto try and usher my son out of the door and away from the room. My face is\nblushing as I'm turning back to my screen, when a loud noise erupts from my\nheadphones. It takes me a second to understand that the person I'm onboarding\nhas two daughters who stormed into the room mid-argument. We both had a good\nlaugh about it and it really made the call better in some weird way \u2013 like\nwe're all in it together and just dealing with stuff. \"\n\n## 5\\. The queen of miscommunication\n\n\"I joined a Zoom meeting with about 35 people in it,\" says Allison Parc,\nfounder and president of [Brenne Whiskey](https://www.brennewhisky.com/). \"But\nI confused the meeting memo and thought everyone was showing up in crazy hats.\nI was a couple minutes late to joining and when I did, I showed up on camera\nwearing a rather sparkly crown\u2026and NO ONE ELSE was in a fun hat!\"\n\n\"In all honesty, it was a meeting with an amazing group of women, and they\nlovingly demanded I wear it the whole time anyhow. Now, when I log into\nvirtual happy hours I make sure I have a little pile of colored wigs and hats\nto choose from to help lighten the mood\u2026just not when showing up to a more\nformal meeting!\"\n\n## 6\\. Flush with embarrassment\n\n\"On one of my conference calls, someone was unmuted while using the toilet,\"\nsays Heather Kleinschmidt, founder of [All\nBecome](https://www.allbecome.com/). Luckily, this person didn't have their\ncamera on.\n\nIn fact, they may still not know that everyone on the call heard them do their\nbusiness. \"No one said a word,\" says Kleinschmidt. \"The presenter just\ncontinued as though nothing was happening, and no one else interjected. There\nwere a lot of people on the call, and we don't all know each other very well!\"\n\nMore:[Humor](/career-advice/tag/humor)[Office Culture](/career-\nadvice/tag/office-culture)\n\nMore From Ladders\n\n[Legal](https://www.theladders.com/corporate/terms)|[Privacy](https://www.theladders.com/corporate/privacy)|[Press\n& Media](https://www.theladders.com/press)|[Work at\nLadders](https://www.facebook.com/workatladders/)\n\n[Highest-Paying Jobs](/jobs/highest-paying-jobs)|[Highest-Paying\nCareers](/jobs/highest-paying-careers)|[Highest-Paying\nCompanies](/company)|[Highest-Paying Industries](/jobs/industry)|[Cities &\nStates](/jobs/highest-paying-locations)|[Expert Network](/experts)|[News &\nCareer Advice Directory](/career-advice/all)\n\n\u00a9 2020 Ladders, Inc.\n\n"}, {"item": "Your New, Ideal Candidate is Probably a Liar - HR Technologist", "link": "https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/your-new-ideal-candidate-is-probably-a-liar-2/", "guid": "CAIiENVG4mG5fhmSLb9KVwEXDAsqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowuaD7CjD8y_MCMMr1oQY", "pubdate": "Wed, 25 Mar 2020 14:39:49 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/your-new-ideal-candidate-is-probably-a-liar-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Your New, Ideal Candidate is Probably a Liar</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">HR Technologist</font>", "source": "HR Technologist", "body": "![](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/images/loaderimage.gif)\n\n  * Skip to Main Navigation\n  * Skip to Main Content\n  * Skip to Footer\n\n[![](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/images/logo.png?20170407)\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com \"HR Technologist\")\n\n  * [ Articles](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/ \"Articles\")\n  * [ Interviews](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/ \"Interviews\")\n  * [ News](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/ \"News\")\n  * [ Resources](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/whitepapers/ \"Resources\")\n  * [ Webinars](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/webinar/ \"Webinars\")\n\n  * Follow Us \n\nFollow Us\n\n[ __](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist \"Follow Us on Facebook\") [\n__](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist \"Follow Us on Twitter\") [\n__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-technologist \"Follow Us on LinkedIn\")\n[ __](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/feed/ \"Subscribe to RSS Feed\")\n\n  * [ __](javascript:void\\(0\\);

If so, what makes\nthem take the risk? ResumeLab asked more than 1,000 professionals if they ever\nsugar-coated or stretched the truth on their resumes. Here's what we found\nout, writes Pete Sosnowski is VP & Co-Founder at ResumeLab.**_\n\nLet\u2019s be honest:\n\nSome of us have either lied or at least considered lying on a resume at some\npoint in our careers.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nStretching employment dates, adding skills we don\u2019t excel at, etc.,\n\nThe question is\u2014\n\nHow _often_ do job seekers cross the line and bend the truth on a resume?\n\nAt ResumeLab, we recently ran a survey of 1,000+ people, looking to answer the\nabove question and more. We wanted to know why people lied and what led them\nto such decisions. While some of the findings were intuitive, others were\nquite eye-popping.\n\nKeep scrolling to see what we\u2019ve discovered.\n\n## **Everybody Lies or Do They?**\n\nIn our study, we didn\u2019t want to beat around the bush.\n\nWe wanted to know why people lie on a resume as well as pinpoint systemic\nreasons why they do it.\n\nIt turns out\u2014\n\nLying on a resume is nothing short of common.\n\nBased on our data, a substantial majority of industry professionals ( _93\npercent_ ) know a person who lied on a resume when looking for a job.\n\n**The most common lies revolved around:**\n\n  * Job experience ( _25 percent_ )\n  * Job duties ( _21 percent_ )\n  * Employment dates ( _16 percent_ )\n  * Skills ( _15 percent_ )\n  * Salary ( _10 percent_ )\n\n![Lying on resume numbers](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\nPerhaps, lying on a resume is so common among professionals because it's\nrelatively easy to get away with a few _inconsequential_ lies. Some companies\njust don't bother to backchannel prospective hires or don't put to the test\nthe skills listed on a resume.\n\nPercentage-wise, only 31 percent of surveyed respondents were caught. Of\nthose, 65 percent were either fired or not hired.\n\nThat means only 21 percent of people who lied on their resume paid the price\nof losing a job or being passed up on one.\n\n## **Oh, the Lies We Tell**\n\nHere comes the fun part:\n\nWe wanted to turn the tables and ask the responders if _they_ ever lied on a\nresume.\n\nThe result?\n\nThe numbers change drastically.\n\nIn fact, only 36 percent of respondents confessed to lying on a resume. That\u2019s\na whopping 57 percent drop-off.\n\n![confessed to lying](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\nWhy the discrepancy?\n\nThere's a slim chance we sampled a group of truth-tellers, or it just so\nhappens that everyone knows dozens of people of whom just single individuals\nlie.\n\nTruth is:\n\nThey\u2019re lying about _not_ lying.\n\nTo prove it, we asked additional questions and found the root of the issue:\nthe majority of people lie on their resume without even realizing it.\n\nIn fact, we discovered that working professionals don't think they are lying\non a resume when they stretch employment dates, add skills they don't have,\nand boost critical achievements from former jobs.\n\nThe result?\n\nA full 56 percent of people actually lie on their resume\u2014whether they realize\nit or not. So the real percentage of people who lie is 56 percent in total,\ncompared to the initial number of just 36.\n\n## **Why Do People Lie?**\n\nLet\u2019s be blunt:\n\nPeople are willing to sugarcoat things on a resume because they want to get an\ninterview and the job. The question is, what triggers them to lie?\n\n**The four most common reasons include:**\n\n  * I was unemployed for an extended period of time ( _37 percent_ )\n  * I didn't think I'd get caught ( _18 percent_ )\n  * I wanted a higher salary for that position ( _18 percent_ )\n  * I wasn't qualified for the job ( _17 percent_ )\n\n  \nDesperate times call for desperate measures, huh?\n\nThat said, a lie is a lie.\n\nNo matter if you call it sugarcoating, rounding up, or fudging the numbers. If\nthere's a discrepancy between reality and how it's reported on, that's _still_\nlying.\n\n## **Stacking It All Up**\n\nSurprisingly or not, one thing is clear:\n\nLying on a resume is quite common among working professionals, and most of\nthem are confident they won't ever get caught.\n\nTo tackle it, I encourage recruiters and hiring managers alike to spend every\nounce of their energy to run robust background checks on potential hires:\n\n  * Make sure the candidate\u2019s resume and cover letter match, story-wise.\n  * Examine the person's online presence on LinkedIn, Facebook, among others.\n  * Make a simple phone call to the previous employer to verify employment dates, job titles, and key responsibilities.\n  * Put to the test the candidate\u2019s skills via a test assignment.\n\n  \nWith these simple precautions in place, you'll greatly reduce the chances of\nhiring dishonest candidates.\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fyour-new-ideal-candidate-is-probably-a-\nliar-2%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Your+New%2C+Ideal+Candidate+Is+Probably+a+Liar\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Your+New%2C+Ideal+Candidate+Is+Probably+a+Liar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fyour-new-ideal-candidate-is-probably-a-\nliar-2%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fyour-new-ideal-candidate-is-probably-a-\nliar-2%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fyour-new-ideal-candidate-is-probably-a-\nliar-2%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Your New, Ideal Candidate Is Probably a\nLiar&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fyour-new-ideal-candidate-is-probably-a-\nliar-2%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

are an indispensable resource \u2013 and in this competitive hiring\nmarket, companies can\u2019t afford turnover. So now more than ever, businesses\nmust work on retaining their best employees to ensure they\u2019re running as\neffectively and efficiently as possible.\n\nThere are many ways companies can do this, but getting started out of the gate\nto improve onboarding with a thorough and [welcoming onboarding\nprocess](https://www.hrmorning.com/news/5-simple-ways-to-make-your-new-hire-\nfeel-welcome/) is one of the best ways to show your employees what they mean\nto your business. They\u2019ll know that you value them and they\u2019ll be eager to\nstick around longer.\n\nOf course, onboarding can be time-consuming, but luckily, the latest HR\ntechnology can help you establish a systematized approach to onboarding while\ncarefully monitoring all of its important aspects.\n\nHere are five great ways investing in automation can improve onboarding and\nhelp you retain your top talent.\n\n### Establish a single source of communication\n\nThe fast pace of modern tech development has made it difficult for companies\nto keep track of all the channels where they can find new employees.\nOftentimes, candidates will contact businesses through multiple channels when\nsearching for jobs making it challenging to track communication and new\napplicants throughout all the platforms. Additionally, it\u2019s difficult to\nassess potential employees and manage them for proper onboarding.\n\nTo help with this process, you can use software solutions like[ assessment\nsoftware](https://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/solutions/assessment-software/)\nto store and manage applications in a single database. That way, you won\u2019t\nhave to work across multiple platforms.\n\n### Automate sourcing and screening tasks\n\nArtificial intelligence is making its way into various software solutions like\napplicant tracking systems, time clock software, and others. And when it comes\nto onboarding and hiring new employees, it can help HR pros immensely. Here's\nhow:\n\n#### Giving responses to applicants\n\nWhen there\u2019s a large volume of applicants, like with bulk hiring, onboarding\nmanagers may find it a challenge to respond to all of them. In these\nsituations, an AI-powered onboarding software can help generate proper\nresponses and send them automatically.\n\n#### Performing sourcing and screening\n\nAI software can also help with screening and sourcing. Through its\nunderstanding of job requirements, it can look for candidates that meet the\ncriteria, shortlist them and rank them properly. This allows managers to\nquickly determine which candidates to focus on first.\n\n#### Getting all relevant information\n\nAI has the power to gather information about candidates and store it in a\nstructured manner. This structure makes it easier for HR reps to assess\ncandidates based on the stored data.\n\n### Evaluate candidate qualifications\n\nOne of the more tedious tasks for hiring managers is to go through many\napplications and narrow down the list to people who are qualified to do the\njob. Modern technology gives HR managers the information they need to evaluate\ncandidates based on knowledge, skills, experience, employment, history, and\nother relevant information \u2013 all displayed on one dashboard. From there, they\ncan take it one candidate at a time.\n\n#### Sorting applicants\n\nSome HR solutions come with features, functionalities and options that make\ntesting candidates easier, giving objective results that can tell managers\nwhether someone would be a good fit for the company. Instead of just relying\non their subjective opinions, managers can use these solutions to give\nunbiased scores and make better hiring decisions.\n\nFurthermore, these tools allow managers to sort candidates using different\ncriteria such as:\n\n    * Career achievements \n    * Portfolios \n    * Education level \n    * Various demographic factors \n    * Work experience \n\n#### Selecting top candidates\n\nEven though applicants are already sorted neatly, it\u2019s important to narrow\ndown the list and choose only the candidates who best match your requirements.\nTo do this, you will have to evaluate them in a meaningful way. A software\nsolution can save time at this step by providing personalized aptitude test\nfeatures and quiz makers you can use for your evaluations.\n\n### Improve employee onboarding\n\nTechnology can help speed up the onboarding process by automating manual tasks\nthat are time-consuming. Automation allows managers to send out all\napplications and onboarding forms to new hires as soon as they get the job so\nthat employees get all the paperwork done before coming in to work. At the\nsame time, the software can send onboarding managers notifications about which\nemployees have finished their documentation and which haven\u2019t.\n\nWith these more monotonous tasks out of the way, onboarding managers can focus\non more important aspects of onboarding: They can engage new hires, tell them\nabout their new workplace and get to know them better.\n\n### Follow-up\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to make the onboarding process smooth, the story of\nretaining employees doesn\u2019t end there. After someone has joined your team,\nfollow up with proper practices to keep them engaged.\n\n#### Providing employee development\n\nTo most employees, the prospect of growing as professionals and acquiring new\nskills is just as important as the work they\u2019re doing. With the help of HR\ntraining software,  or[ learning management\nsolutions,](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/lms-learning-management-\nsystem/) managers can instantly offer lessons, courses, and training. With\ntraining software, it\u2019s easier to create personalized training and adjust it\nto the employees\u2019 level of knowledge.\n\n#### Getting feedback from your employees\n\nListening to your employees is essential as it shows that you value their\nopinions and promote transparency within your company culture. [HR training\nsoftware ](https://www.proprofs.com/training/solutions/hr-training-\nsoftware/)can be used to gather feedback about courses and other essential\nissues. This information is then shared privately with the manager.\n\nEstablishing good onboarding practices will not only help your business handle\nthe hiring process more efficiently, but it will also help you choose the\nright people and [retain them](https://hbr.org/2012/11/five-ways-to-retain-\nemployees). Engaged employees will stay a lot longer because they find their\nwork meaningful in some way \u2013 so grabbing their attention right at the\nonboarding process will go a long way in keeping them satisfied.  \n\nIn this digital age, using modern software solutions that offer advanced\nfunctionalities can advance your business in a lot of ways. While it can be a\nbit of an investment, training software and onboarding platforms will pay for\nthemselves in the end by freeing up busy HR professionals to focus on the more\n\u2018human\u2019 elements of the job.  \n\n__________________\n\n![Kamy Anderson, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Kamy\nAnderson, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Kamy\nAnderson, HR Expert Contributor](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/andersonbio-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Kamy Anderson, HR Expert\nContributor](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/kamyandersonhrmorning-com/)\n\nKamy Anderson is an ed-tech enthusiast with a passion for writing on emerging\ntechnologies in corporate training and education.

onboarding more meaningful and effective,\nsays Lilith Christiansen of software developer SilkRoad.\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") |

job bringing\nnew talent into the organisation.\n\nToday\u2019s onboarding approaches should provide new hires with clear expectations\nin terms of their behavior and interaction with management, customers and\nother employees.\n\nAll too often, however, onboarding consists of little more than paperwork and\nmaybe a brief summary of the organisation\u2019s mission.\n\nStrategic onboarding seeks to solve that issue by moving beyond automating\npaperwork. Instead, it delivers a personalized journey that transforms new\nhires into fully functioning, integrated members of the team.\n\nStrategic onboarding is made up of four pillars: cultural mastery,\ninterpersonal network development, early career support, and strategy\nimmersion and direction.\n\nCultural mastery is a critical component, but one that often gets overlooked.\nBy providing employees with a sense of formal and informal norms and how to\nthrive within them, HR will enable new hires to fit in quickly.\n\nThey need to understand the ins and outs of company culture in honest and\nauthentic ways, or else the organisation risks losing them\u2014and in a time of\nnear-zero unemployment, that\u2019s a big risk to take these days.\n\nThe challenge for many organisations is defining their culture. There are a\nfew questions that can help start the process: What\u2019s the \u201creal and true\u201d\nstory? What\u2019s changing as the organisation grows and evolves? Are there any\nhidden perceptions that need to be unearthed? Are there any old traditions\nthat need to be carried forward? Is the organisation aspiring to build a\ndifferent culture than what exists today?\n\nTo find out the answers to these questions, HR can conduct a cultural audit.\nAt its core, a cultural audit is a simple, three-step process that includes\nasking, documenting and analysing.\n\nEach of these three steps plays a critical role in understanding and\nestablishing an organisation\u2019s culture.\n\n**1\\. Ask.** Conduct business leader interviews and use employee surveys and\nfocus groups to get a sense of what all individuals across the entire\norganisation feel are the core tenets of the company culture. Each level in\nthe organisation likely has a different take, based on their day-to-day\nexperiences.\n\n**2\\. Document.** Take the results of the surveys, focus groups, and\ninterviews and document the corporate values, unconscious expectations, daily\nbehaviors and practices, perceptions (even myths!), and anything of potential\nvalue that helps paint a picture of the culture.\n\n**3\\. Analyse.** Once the data has been collected and documented, examine it\ncarefully to identify factors that are consistent as well as differences\nbetween sources. See if the data aligns with current strategies. Look closely\nto see if perceived, actual, stated or desired cultures emerge. In particular,\ntake note of areas where there\u2019s a disconnect between the aspirational culture\nand the way the organisation currently functions.\n\nBy completing a cultural audit, organisations will get a firm sense of their\nculture\u2014both where it excels and where it needs improvement.\n\n\n\n### **Bringing the culture to life**\n\nBy defining their organisation\u2019s culture, HR will be taking the first step\ntoward integrating cultural mastery into a strategic onboarding program. To\nbring that culture to life, HR must demonstrate to new hires how it supports\nbusiness strategy to positively impact outcomes. Here are some suggested\napproaches:\n\n  * Short videos from current employees are a great way for new hires to get a real sense of the culture in an authentic way.\n\n  * Assigning a new-hire buddy at the peer level gives the new employee an opportunity to learn the culture from a peer in an easy, low pressure way.\n\n  * Hosting a recent new hire panel discussion by bringing in two or three recent hires who\u2019ve been with the organisation for between six and nine months is a good way to communicate actual experience.\n\n  * Provide managers with discussion prompts to talk about culture and even compare and contrast the company culture with the new hire\u2019s former employer.\n\n  * Social events are also a good way to encourage opportunities for new hires and existing employees to get to know each other and share personal experiences that illustrate culture and the \u201cunwritten rules\u201d of the organisation.\n\nBy knowing and communicating an authentic cultural story, HR can help new\nhires plug into the organisation\u2019s true culture. This will help them succeed\nand increase the likelihood they\u2019ll stay with the organisation.\n\n* * *\n\n_**This story was originally published on**\n**[HRExecutive.com](http://hrexecutive.com/)** , **HRM Magazine Asia 's sister\npublication in the US**. **The author is Lilith Christiansen, vice president\nof onboarding solutions for SilkRoad.**_\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fboost-\nretention-strategic-onboarding%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Boost+retention+by+making+your+onboarding+program+strategic&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fboost-\nretention-strategic-onboarding%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fboost-\nretention-strategic-onboarding%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nExpert Panel, Forbes Human Resources Council\n\nSuccessful HR executives from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) offer leadership and management\ninsights.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nSome businesses have a system implemented where they set up exit interviews\nwhen employees leave. While these can be useful, they don't focus on retaining\nthe business's talent. In this competitive atmosphere, letting a talented\nemployee go to a competitor could spell disaster for the business.\n\nStay interviews try to focus on what the enterprise could do to help the\nemployee remain with the company. To help companies interested in recovering\ntheir talent before they leave, 12 professionals from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) explore the strategies they use in\nsimilar situations and why they work so well at keeping employees with their\nbusinesses.\n\nMembers offer tips for uncovering what might make an employee stay with your\norganization.\n\nPhotos courtesy of the individual members\n\n**1\\. Get Personal**\n\nStay interviews need to target the personal side of an employee, not just\ntheir current work. Ask about their aspirations, what inspires them, what they\nlook for in a leader, what opportunities they want outside of work\n(volunteering, writing a blog, etc.)? This gives the organization and\nleadership an idea of how they can support the whole person. -[ Lotus\nBuckner](https://twitter.com/lotusbuckner),[ NCH](http://www.nch.org/)\n\n**2\\. Be Consistent And Transparent**\n\nStay interviews are a key part of any listening strategy! Employees need to\nknow there are mechanisms in place for them to share their thoughts about why\nyour company is a great place to work, and also where you could improve. The\nbest strategy is consistency and transparency, so employees know they could be\ncalled upon to participate and that actions are taken as part of the listening\nprocess. - [Diane Strohfus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dianestrohfus/),[\nBetterworks.com](http://www.betterworks.com/)\n\n**3\\. Try To Understand The \u2018Why\u2019**\n\nWe conduct stay interviews as soon as HR gets an inkling that a good employee\nmay want to leave. This allows us to address issues upfront and have an open\ndiscussion with the employee as to why they want to leave, and allows HR and\nthe manager to determine if it is something that can be fixed. It has worked\nfor us fairly well. When an employee is set on moving on we try to understand\nthe \"why.\" - [Dana Garaventa, GPHR,\nPHR](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danagaraventa/),[ Opus One Winery\nLLC](http://www.opusonewinery.com/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only organization for HR\nexecutives across all industries. _**Do I qualify?**_\n\n**4\\. Know Your Key Players**\n\nMake sure your organization knows exactly who their key players are. These are\nthe people you want to retain, but make sure they aren't the only ones you\nconduct stay interviews with, as this will lead to cultural disruption in\nother places. Usually, there is a reason why these people are your key\nplayers, so just make sure these reasons stay valid. - [Reinhard\nGuggenberger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rguggenberger/),[ Soaring Fox\nConsulting](http://www.soaringfox.com/en/)\n\n**5\\. Conduct Pulse Interviews**\n\nTry \"pulsing\" the stay interview and making it a regular part of the employee\nexperience. Ask one or two strategic questions at regular intervals throughout\nthe year. This strips away the formality and allows for regular data\ncollection so the organization can respond accordingly, rather than waiting\nuntil a good employee wants to leave to find out what would make them stay. -\n[Gwyn Purdue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gwyn-purdue-shrm-cp-shrbp-\ncep-17320679/),[ Wafra Inc.](http://www.wafra.com/)\n\n**6\\. Include Stay Interviews In Onboarding**\n\nSchedule 30-, 60- and 90-day stay interviews as part of an employee's\nonboarding program. This structured approach provides insights and pivot\npoints during the critical time of an employee's time at a new organization.\nThese are particularly effective when the recruiter facilitates the stay\ninterviews because this results in trust and candid conversation. - [Jessica\nDelorenzo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicadelorenzo/),[ Kimball\nElectronics Inc](http://www.kimballelectronics.com/)\n\n**7\\. Identify The MVPs**\n\nIdentify the MVPs. Have them articulate their career goals two years out, one\nyear out, six months out, etc. Ask someone who that MVP looks up to if they're\nwilling to be the mentor. Make part of the agenda for the mentor to ask how\nthe mentee feels about the job. Respect the confidentiality. Ask the mentor\nfor help retaining the mentee, and create an anonymous feedback mechanism for\nall staff. -[ Zain Hasan](https://twitter.com/zainshasan),[ Risk Strategies\nCompany](http://www.risk-strategies.com/)\n\n**8\\. Try Listening**\n\nA \"stay interview\" is fancy HR speak for \"listen to your people.\" Seems like a\nno-brainer, but most of us are so busy, we forget to have real conversations\nwith our employees. Create opportunities for team members to talk to managers,\nleaders and HR, and then react to the feedback appropriately. Unwanted\nturnover is the price employers pay for not listening, and that's a problem\nfor any company. -[ Tracy Cote](https://twitter.com/tracyrene),[\nZenefits](http://www.zenefits.com/)\n\n**9\\. Provide A Suggestion Box**\n\nSome employees may want to provide valuable insight on how a company can\nimprove, but are hesitant to do so for fear of retribution by management or\nco-workers. Therefore, when conducting stay interviews, employers should\nconsider providing an anonymous method of submitting feedback, either online\nor via a physical suggestion box, allowing employees to speak honestly and\nunreservedly. -[ John Feldmann](https://twitter.com/john_feldmann),[\nInsperity](http://www.insperity.com/)\n\n**10\\. Get Outside**\n\nFind ways to facilitate regular check-ins with employees outside of the office\nsetting. A walk around the building, meeting for coffee or scheduling a hike\nare great ways to change the mood of the discussion and allow both parties to\nfeel more comfortable discussing their engagement at work. -[ Elisa\nGarn](https://twitter.com/elisagarn),[ Me Degreed - The Career Brand\nArchitects](http://www.medegreed.com/)\n\n**11\\. Use One-On-One Time To Retain Talent**\n\nLeaders that conduct regular one-on-one sessions with their direct and skip-\nlevel reports are more aware of their team members' interests, frustrations\nand career aspirations. Leaders should leverage a few minutes of every one-on-\none to ensure they understand and retain their top talent to avoid being\ncaught unaware at a resignation. -[ Jennifer\nMarszalek](https://twitter.com/jenmarsz),[ Working Credit\nNFP](http://www.workingcredit.org/)\n\n**12\\. Be Aware Of Culture, Timing And Environment**\n\nBe mindful of the timing and location of such conversations. Choosing to speak\nwith an employee who is working under a pending deadline or selecting a\nmeeting room near their workspace may not be wise. A mutually comfortable\nlocation, and a conversation that is not constrained by subsequent\ncommitments, will help enable a higher level of trust and yield more accurate\nand genuine responses. - [Erald\nMinga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eraldminga/), [Kellogg School of\nManagement](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/)\n\n[![Forbes Human Resources Council](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/assets/images/avatars/blog-4332_400_ca7d92be72a8ef01cadb837abca3e5f4.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/\n\"Photo of Forbes Human Resources Council\")\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only, fee-based organization\nfor senior-level human resources executives across all industries.

[Find out more about the webinars\n\u00bb](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\n\n### _Onboarding is usually a lengthy, manual process at most organisations.\nHere 's how US-based Alen Brcic, Director of HR Technology, Novant Health and\nhis team took it to the next level with efficiency in mind and a superb\ndigital experience._\n\nHiring the right talent to join our team and deliver remarkable patient care\ncalls for an enhanced HR digital foundation. We found _the_ remarkable\ncandidate and they have accepted our offer of employment. What now?\n\nOnboarding is usually a lengthy, manual process at most organisations due to\nstringent local and federal requirements. But, with efficiency in mind and a\nsuperb digital experience, we have taken it to the next level.\n\nWe started by asking ourselves the following questions.\n\n  * How do we scale this across four states and become agile?\n  * Why are there so many paper forms?\n  * How easy is it for team members to complete onboarding?\n  * What do we do with the huge amount of paperwork that is generated?\n  * Why do we print, scan and shred?\n  * Why so many manual steps and touches? The questions continue.\n\nLet us tackle this one question at a time.\n\n### **Why are there so many manual steps and multiple touches during this\nprocess?**\n\nUsing digitisation within our applicant tracking system, we have deployed a\nmodern onboarding approach that enables team members to complete their\nonboarding tasks in less than five minutes at times.\n\nOur research shows that this has significantly personalised and enhanced the\ncandidate experience. In this age of digital transformation and fast-paced\nworkplace, who has time to waste on filling out all this paperwork, right?\n\n### **Next, how do we scale this across four states and become agile? **\n\nComplexity of federal laws requires the [I-9\nprocess](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9) to be completed and verified by candidates\npresenting work eligibility documents in person. There is no need for a long\nwaiting line at new-hire orientation or candidates making a special trip to HR\noffices.\n\nWe have contracted with a vendor that offers a nationwide network of providers\nso that new team members can conveniently schedule where and when they want to\nget their I-9 process completed before their start date.\n\n> ##### Let me tell you that it can be done and you should do it - the first\n> step is to tell yourself just that!\n\n### **Sounds good but how about all of the paper or PDF forms?**\n\nWith this initiative, we have eliminated the filling out of all actual\npaperwork wherever it is legally permissible, leveraging digitisation.\n\nNow hold on! What do we do with these digital records that are dispersed\nacross multiple systems? It is understandable that people are completing forms\nonline but how are you retaining them? Do we continue the vicious cycle of\nprinting, scanning and shredding? Do we start saving PDF files on a shared\ndrive and then start indexing them?\n\nSounds easy. Not when you multiply that by 6,000-7,000 annual hires each\nhaving over 15-20 dispersed documents across multiple digital platforms.\n\nRemember the concept of agility? A real cross-functional team operating in\nsync can definitely solve this.\n\nHaving the ability to leverage modern integration technologies such as REST\nAPI and SOAP API with our vendors and automating daily loads of forms to our\nHyland OnBase document repository has enabled us to streamline the on-boarding\nprocess completely.\n\nDocuments flow from our ATS and background check/I-9 vendor directly to our\nteam member document repository. Those documents are accessible when needed\nwithin our core HCM system. Efficient and time-saving.\n\n### **How to start a similar initiative at your organisation?**\n\nLet me tell you that it can be done and you should do it - the first step is\nto tell yourself just that! After you have overcome your own doubts, start to\nmap your processes and identify key areas that are very manual and paper\nintensive.\n\nThe next question is to determine why? Do we have a capability issue in terms\nof the technology that we have or we simply never asked the question? Have we\nreally explored our ecosystem of tools available to us throughout our\norganisation?\n\nWhat you will find is that most companies have the digital capabilities to\nachieve many transformative initiatives, the only thing that is holding them\nback is seeking them out. They may not come as a standard pre-packaged tool\nset, but rather may be dispersed across your organisation.\n\nDo not be afraid to explore and form your own cross-functional team, which\nmost likely will be comprised from a number of different areas throughout your\norganisation.\n\nThis new process, thanks to a cross-functional team with innovative solutions,\nfreed up HR resources to shift the focus on what is truly important: finding\nthe next best talent to deliver remarkable patient care.\n\nThis is one example of how HR at Novant Health is moving away from\ntransactional work towards being a strategic partner to the organisation. It\ncan do the same for your organisation!\n\n* * *\n\n_[Novant Health](https://www.novanthealth.org/home/about-us.aspx) is a four-\nstate integrated network of 15 hospitals and more than 350 physician\npractices, based in North Carolina, United States.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nExpert Panel, Forbes Human Resources Council\n\nSuccessful HR executives from[ Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/) offer leadership and management\ninsights.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nBusinesses tend to develop traditionalist mindsets when it comes to their\nsystems. It's not surprising to hear people say that the reason they do things\nis because it's the way things have always been done. But sometimes, sticking\nto traditionalist thinking can negatively impact a company.\n\nA perfect example of this is when a company's new employee onboarding process\nis outdated. The result is an employee who is unsure of what their role is and\nwhat they should be doing within the company.\n\nTo help businesses that need to revamp their onboarding processes, 11\ncontributors to[ Forbes Human Resources Council](https://forbeshrcouncil.com/)\noffer suggestions on what companies should do when implementing the new\nsystem.\n\nMembers share their best tips for implementing a new employee onboarding\nsystem.\n\nPhotos courtesy of the individual members.\n\n**1\\. Target A Diverse Workforce**\n\nMost executives are unaware of the four-fifths rule of selection rates,\nevidence of disparate impact and discriminatory effects on a protected group.\nBusinesses need to consider this rule to ensure their applicant sourcing\npipelines are capturing a diverse population. This requires maturity on behalf\nof the executive team to understand and support a diverse and inclusive\nworkforce. Branch out! -[ Christine\nWzorek](https://twitter.com/christinewzorek),[ White Label\nAdvisors](https://www.whitelabeladvisors.com/)\n\n**2\\. Reflect Your Organization's Culture**\n\nOnboarding is the official \"welcome to the team.\" It should build on your\nemployment brand and selection process and reflect your organization's day-to-\nday culture. Make sure it hits the basics like an office tour, tech and\nbenefits but don't forget to add in snacks, activities or tokens that make\nyour team(s) uniquely you. That could be a red carpet, custom coffees or a\nheadshot photo shoot. -[ Jennifer Marszalek](https://twitter.com/jenmarsz)\n\n**3\\. Onboard Employees For Months, Not Days**\n\nYour new hires will have an idea whether a job is a good fit for them as early\nas the first day. If they feel ignored or ill-prepared to start work after the\nfirst week, the likelihood that they will leave increases. An inclusive, well-\nplanned and ongoing onboarding process led by an employee\u2019s manager that lasts\nat least six months will dramatically improve those statistics. -[ Cameron\nBishop](https://twitter.com/CbishopMuscle),[\nSkillPath](http://www.skillpath.com/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only organization for HR\nexecutives across all industries. _**Do I qualify?**_\n\n**4\\. Consider Your Employee's Needs**\n\nThe onboarding process is often designed with only employer business\nobjectives in mind. To be successful, companies should incorporate new\nemployee needs. How do they envision their first days, weeks, months? What are\ntheir concerns? What do they need to succeed on their new team? A continuous\nassessment and inclusion into the process will make the experience more\nrewarding for both parties. -[ Rachel\nLyubovitzky](https://twitter.com/rlyubovitzky),[\nEverythingBenefits](http://www.everythingbenefits.com/)\n\n**5\\. Prioritize The New Hire Experience**\n\nOnboarding in the past was focused on the employee being lucky to be with the\ncompany. Today employers need to come across as being lucky to have the\nemployee. HR must prioritize the new-hire experience and ask, \u201cWhat would help\nsomeone with no awareness of how we work get up to speed ASAP?\u201d Nothing\nimpresses new hires more than an employer that has anticipated most or all of\ntheir needs. -[ Genine Wilson](https://twitter.com/G9losangeles),[ Kelly\nServices](http://www.kellyservices.com/)\n\n**6\\. Design For The Disappointed**\n\nDesign your program around the disappointed -- focusing on the happy will help\nyou progress, but a lot slower. If you focus on the disappointed then you are\nattempting to close loose ends. Don't worry about the happy; they're already\nhappy, and they'll continue being happy while they see you helping those who\nneed it! -[ Adam Mellor](https://twitter.com/AdamCMellor),[ ONE Gas,\nInc.](http://www.onegas.jobs/)\n\n**7\\. Remember That One Size Does Not Fit All**\n\nBoth onboarding and orientation should evolve regularly as the company grows\nand changes. Survey your new hires to discover whether they learned everything\nthey needed to during their orientation or onboarding experience, and seek\ntheir input and advice to make it better for future hires. Then adjust or\nrevamp your process based on their feedback. Rinse and repeat. -[ Tracy\nCote](https://twitter.com/tracyrene),[ Genesys](http://www.genesys.com/)\n\n**8\\. Start Onboarding As Soon As They Say 'Yes'**\n\nIn our competitive talent market with candidates reneging on offers or\n\"ghosting\" on their first day, it is important to start onboarding as soon as\nthe candidate has accepted. Create a portal where new information or\ninteresting articles are posted, have members of their new team (and manager)\ncall and email regularly, and send some swag to get them excited about the\ncompany and their new team. - [Danielle\nMonaghan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniellemonaghan),[\nUber](http://www.uber.com/)\n\n**9\\. Ensure Commitment From The Entire Organization**\n\nThe first place to look is at the scope of the current process. Is the process\nHR-centric, or is everyone involved, from top management to the new hire's\npeers? Does the process start and stop in the new employee's first 30 days, or\ndoes it start once the job offer is accepted and continue through the first\nsix months? If not the latter in both cases, then a new process is required. -\n[Dan Fries](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danfriessibson),[ Sibson\nConsulting](http://www.sibson.com/)\n\n**10\\. Look For New Ideas**\n\nWhen making a change, look to all types of resources to gain information.\nAttend classes, read industry articles and attend webinars to gain insight\nabout new trends. Be open to new ideas and think outside the box to gain a new\nperspective. Also, reach out to other industry professionals to see what may\nwork for their company. This will allow you to evaluate the current program\neffectively. - [Debi Bliazis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/debi-bliazis-phr-\nshrm-cp-4a182811),[ Champions School of Real\nEstate](http://www.championsschool.com/)\n\n**11\\. Communicate Your Vision Early**\n\nBusinesses should communicate their vision and values immediately. Research\nhas shown high-performing workers want to work for companies with clear values\nwho articulate how their role will positively impact the company. Prioritizing\nthem during onboarding helps new hires absorb the workplace culture, makes\nthem more confident in their decision to join the organization, and boosts\nengagement. -[ Lisa Sterling](https://twitter.com/lisamsterling),[\nCeridian](http://www.ceridian.com/)\n\n[![Forbes Human Resources Council](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/assets/images/avatars/blog-4332_400_ca7d92be72a8ef01cadb837abca3e5f4.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/\n\"Photo of Forbes Human Resources Council\")\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/)\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only, fee-based organization\nfor senior-level human resources executives across all industries.

make-or-break time for them.\n\nA positive welcoming experience puts them at ease: It reinforces the feeling\nthat joining your company was a great decision.\n\nThat good feeling can carry over for years to come as good people develop an\nappreciation for their work and the organization they work for. That breeds\nloyalty - a key component of a stronger workforce, and an essential\ncharacteristic of what keeps organizations going strong.\n\nThere's lots to cover. Click to jump ahead.\n\n    * What is Onboarding?\n    * Why Onboarding is Important\n    * The Onboarding Process\n    * Job Orientation\n    * Onboarding Checklist\n    * Other Onboarding Best Practices\n    * The Final Step\n\n## **What is Onboarding?**\n\nOnboarding is the process of integrating employees into the work environment\nand providing them with good reasons to feel comfortable about the job. It\nshould be a key part of every organization's talent management plan.\n\n### **A Successful Onboarding Process:**\n\n    * Establishes a strong employer welcome.\n    * Affirms the employee made the right job choice.\n    * Allows the employee to see how she or he fits in with the organization.\n    * Sets the stage for long-term relationship building, which improves retention.\n\nOnboarding is often called the last stage of the recruitment process - and the\nfirst step toward retention.\n\nDone well, companies benefit from employee onboarding and sound new hire\norientation by creating a stronger workforce and valuable long-term\nrelationships, which makes for a more productive and profitable company.\n\n**_Worth the Read:_**\n\n    * [Onboarding in 2019: What a Knock-Out First Day Should Look Like](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/onboarding-2019/)\n    * [Onboarding: First-Week Tactics That Pave the Way to Success](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/onboarding-first-week-tactics/)\n    * [The Critical Onboarding Mistake 67% of Employers Make](https://www.hrmorning.com/news/the-critical-onboarding-mistake-67-of-employers-make/)\n\n## **Why Onboarding is Important**\n\n![Cropped shot of  a businessman and businesswoman shaking hands in the\noffice](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Cropped\nshot of  a businessman and businesswoman shaking hands in the\noffice](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1049353490-1600x1067.jpg)\n\nOnboarding best practices really do matter. It\u2019s been shown that if an\nemployee stays with an organization for 18 months, the chances that person\nwill remain with that same company well into the future skyrocket.\n\nThe most crucial part of these 18 months is the first few days for the new\nhire. This is the time when they decide whether the organizations feels like a\ngood fit or if they should keep sending out resumes to other potential\nemployers.\n\nThe cost of bringing on a new employee keeps climbing, too.\n\nDepending on the position and how long it takes to find a qualified candidate,\ncompanies can easily expect the cost of turnover to be 150% of an employee's\nannual salary.\n\nThat means a worker who makes $50,000 a year could cost you $75,000 to\nreplace.\n\nAnd that figure doesn't even include the impact on morale of other employees\nwho are observing the turnover.\n\nWith so much money on the line, getting the right candidate to stay with your\ncompany takes on more importance than many employers give it credit for. The\nfinancial incentives for keeping them on alone make onboarding an important\nprocess.\n\n## **The Onboarding Process**\n\nA lot of the nitty-gritty of the onboarding process will be the work of HR\nprofessionals. They'll handle setting up an employee with the right paperwork\nand policies.\n\nBut the most important work to be done - that which has a direct impact on a\nperson getting acclimated to a new environment - is the responsibility of\nfrontline managers and supervisors.\n\nThese are the people who prepare the workplace for the employee - and prepare\nthe employee for the workplace.\n\nThis report provides guidelines for what you should do - and when - in order\nto make new employees feel welcome and valued, and to make sure they can start\nbeing productive parts of your workplace sooner than you thought possible.\n\nTo get the relationship off on the right foot, it all starts with putting in\nwork ahead of time.\n\n### **Make an Onboarding Checklist**\n\nIt's easy to forget a minor detail here and there - there's a lot that goes\ninto welcoming new employees.\n\nThat's why it might be a good idea to make a checklist. Include all the things\nyou'll be discussing with them, need them to sign and want them to do.\n\nIt helps to have a recently hired employee look over the list to see if\nthere's anything missing, since it'll be most fresh in the mind of someone\nrecently hired.\n\n### **New Hire Orientation**\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-653383170-1600x1068.jpg)\n\nThe first day for new hire orientation should be highly energized and\npositive.\n\nYou've already picked them! There was something about this person that made\nyour organization say they were the one you wanted.\n\nAnd they've picked you, as well. Something made them accept your invitation to\nan interview. And it got them to accept the position when it was offered.\n\nThe interview process is a good place to start when welcoming new candidates\naboard. Think back: What were some of the things that stood out?\n\nDraw on these to make their first day more comfortable.\n\nFor instance, did you talk about a favorite sports team? If so, take the\nliberty of putting their name tag on the team's emblem. Did they mention their\nfamily? Put a picture frame on their desk that they can use for a family\nphoto.\n\nBy the time new hires start, they may have forgotten some of the good vibes\nthey had from the interview. Bringing their memories back to the hiring\nprocess shows you still remember them.\n\nAnd it reassures candidates they've made a great impression in your mind.\n\n## **Job Orientation**\n\nImagine stepping off a plane in a new city. From the minute you walk out of\nthe airport things feel \u2026 different.\n\nYou're surrounded by unfamiliar sights. You don't know anyone. Things seem to\nbe moving at a slightly different speed.\n\nThis is what the first few minutes of a new hire's first day on the job are\nlike.\n\nSure, they've been places like this before, but they haven't been here.\n\nAnd they're going to need some time to get used to it.\n\nThis isn't the time to launch right into department introductions and a\nbuilding tour. Give them the time to get acclimated to their surroundings.\n\nAnd most importantly, give them something to do. Provide a sheet of paper that\nwalks them through logging onto your email and recording a personal voicemail.\n\nNo matter how simple it is, keeping their mind on a task gives new hires a\nchance to acclimate themselves and start the process of feeling comfortable\nwith their new surroundings.\n\n**_Worth the Read:_**\n\n    * [A New Look at New-Hire Orientation](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/a-new-look-at-new-hire-orientation/)\n    * [5 Simple Ways to Make Your New Hire Feel Welcome](https://www.hrmorning.com/news/5-simple-ways-to-make-your-new-hire-feel-welcome/)\n    * [7 Reasons New Hires Hate Their First Day](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/7-reasons-new-hires-hate-their-first-day/)\n\n### **Providing a Contact**\n\nSo the employee has been brought into the building, shown their desk and set\nup with something to do.\n\nBut what happens if they have a question? Or 17 questions?\n\nWhether it's you or a fellow co-worker, you'll want to have someone on call\nfor your employee to talk with.\n\nIn some cases, this could be a mentor - a seasoned employee who knows all the\nins and outs of the company.\n\nOther times, you may want to assign an orientation fellow - a recently hired\nemployee or one with a similar professional background.\n\nAn orientation fellow should be someone who remembers what it's like to be\nstarting a new position and has had a positive experience with the job.\n\nWhen recruiting the contact for the company, make sure you have a good fit.\nSelect someone who genuinely wants to help a new employee and has the time to\ndo so. Don't make it just another task on an already overburdened employee's\nto-do list.\n\n### **Touring the Building**\n\nThe typical next step for welcoming an employee on board is the building tour.\n\"Here's the printer, here's the bathroom,\" etc.\n\nOK, that's good information to have. But is it really going to stick out in an\nemployee's mind?\n\nA better bet is to give them the \"insider's tour.\" Which areas of the building\nhave spotty Wi-Fi coverage? Where can they grab a coffee mug if they forgot\ntheirs at home? What's a quiet place to get some work done if office\nconversations get a little too loud? Which fridge should they put their\nlunches in? What do they do if they lose their security card or key?\n\nLittle tidbits like this go a long way toward making an employee feel like\nthey are part of the place. You're not just showing them the way, you're\nshowing them how things get done.\n\nAnd you're giving them the kinds of info they'd want to know, but that would\ntake a long time to get on their own.\n\nShowing you're an ally and a resource of information is the real key. Doing so\nsets you up not just as a supervisor or manager, but as a trusted and helpful\none.\n\n### **Introduction to the Workplace**\n\n![Friendly manager and company staff welcoming happy new african american\nworker on first work\nday](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Friendly\nmanager and company staff welcoming happy new african american worker on first\nwork day](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1139791157-1600x1067.jpg)\n\nIntroductions should be inclusive, but not overbearing. Obviously, it would be\nnice if employees got to know everyone in the company right off the bat.\n\nBut expecting someone to get to know and remember the names of so many people\nin the span of one morning isn't realistic.\n\nTry this: Don't introduce people based on their title. Introduce them based on\ntheir working relationship with the employee.\n\nFor instance, instead of, \"Meet Bill. He's our payroll clerk,\" say, \"Meet\nBill. He'll collect your time sheet every week and he's the person to see if\nyou have any questions about your paycheck.\"\n\nYou may even want to include this blurb on a list of names for everyone the\nemployee will meet. Check off the name as the employee meets the person, and\ninclude the person's phone extension and email address to save the new hire\nthe time it would take to look it up otherwise.\n\nAfter you're done with the scheduled introductions, send an email to the\noffice. Let them know the new hire has officially come on board and give a\nlittle information about them and where they'll be sitting.\n\nThen invite everyone who hasn't met the employee yet to drop by and say hello\nwhen they get the chance.\n\nSend this invite a few hours after scheduled introductions finish. A second\nwave of people coming and introducing themselves immediately after they've\njust finished scheduled introductions may wind up with the employee feeling a\nbit overwhelmed by new names and faces.\n\n## **Onboarding Checklist**\n\nThere are plenty of documents and papers employees will need to do their jobs.\n\nHere are some examples of what to include:\n\n    * **The mission/purpose statement.** If your company has a mission or purpose statement already, this comes first. Put it on the first page of the binder so employees know what's expected. If you don't have an official statement, just have a brief message.\n    *  **Here is a can 't-miss statement if you don't already have a mission statement:** \"We're a company that respects all our employees - from new hires to established vets - and are really looking forward to having you contribute in a meaningful way! Welcome!\"\n    *  **A building map.** Try to include the names and phone extensions of other employees on the map where they work. That way, new hires can see where to go to pick up that document someone has ready for them.\n    *  **Phone extension/email list.** If you can prioritize this list by listing the employee's department first, so much the better. That way, they don't have to hunt for the name they need (or worry about forgetting which \"Jim\" mans the help desk and which one is the CFO!).\n    *  **A company \"facebook.\"** Well before the popular social network of the same name, these books were made for incoming freshman in college to put a name to the face for their classmates. Why not do the same with pictures of company VIPs (and other key contacts)?\n    *  **Daily schedules.** You should have the employee's first day (or first few days) planned for him or her. Include the schedule so they know what's coming next.\n    *  **Long-term schedules.** When can they start taking vacation or enrolling in the company's 401(k)? When will their first formal/informal review be? When can new workers start accumulating sick days? Having these key milestones on a timeline helps employees see what's next for them, and gets them thinking about their long-term future with the company.\n    *  **HR documents.** Employees will need to receive policies and procedures, benefits enrollment forms, etc. Include these in the folder, but be sure to have someone from HR go over them with the new hire in-person as well - in case there are questions.\n\n## **Other Onboarding Best Practices**\n\nIn addition to these standard items, try including some of the following\nsections as well:\n\n    * **\" What I learned \u2026 \"** Collect anecdotes from employees on the most important thing they picked up in their jobs. What was the moment that made them say \"A-ha!\"? It doesn't have to be anything ground- breaking, just a musing on what people have learned about the workplace along the way. Include a list of one-sentence-or-so anecdotes to make new employees feel welcome (and maybe chuckle a little.)\n    *  **Success stories.** Chances are someone in your company has recently come up with a new way of doing things that's really saved time or reduced frustration. Or maybe they've achieved a milestone (1,000th sale, 35 years with the company, etc.). Maybe they've even had a personal accomplishment such as running a race or organizing a charity fundraiser.\n    *  **When you hear stories like these, share them.** Write a short paragraph about it, then include it in a \"News & Notes\" or \"Success Stories\" section of the onboarding material. This way, new employees will feel as if they're getting to know their co-workers right off the bat.\n    *  **The \"Lingo Board.\"** Managers and supervisors will often find themselves casually dropping an acronym or industry-specific term with a new hire and being greeted with a slack jaw or confused stare.\n\nEach workplace has its own set of terms and lingo that is specific to the\ncompany. It's not a bad thing, these shortcuts are real time-savers when\npeople know their meanings. But until workers are up to speed on the office\nlanguage, provide a list of terms and definitions. Put it in plain English so\nthey can see what they should be looking for when you ask for \"a DBC report.\"\n\nOf course, all the documents in this packet should be available on the company\nintranet as well, but having a one-stop resource for employees on- hand will\nbe a good way to keep them in the loop from the very start.\n\n**_Worth the Read:_**\n\n    * [6 Add-Ons Any Onboarding Program Would Benefit From](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/6-add-ons-any-onboarding-program-would-benefit-from/)\n    * [7 Reasons New Hires Hate Their First Day](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/7-reasons-new-hires-hate-their-first-day/)\n    * [5 Onboarding Tactics That Get Long-Term Results](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/5-onboarding-tactics-that-get-long-term-results/)\n\n### **Being a Good Closer**\n\nAt the end of the worker's first day, you'll want to close out strong. Have a\nbrief one-on-one with the employee to review what they did and whom they spoke\nwith.\n\nThis shouldn't be an in-depth meeting: Just take five minutes or so to see if\nthey have any more questions and touch on what they've learned. Keep it light.\n(Throwing in light-hearted comments like, \"Don't worry, John's not as\nintimidating as he seems!\" goes a long way toward acknowledging their stress\nand comfort levels might be put to the test.)\n\nThen, let the new hire go home.\n\nYou may have noticed not much work has gotten done on the first day: and\nthat's by design. Throw them into the fire too soon, and new employees' minds\nwill be racing.\n\nFirst days are for first impressions. There will be time for getting to the\nreal work.\n\nFor now, leave them feeling good about their experiences and ready to start in\nearnest the next day.\n\nEasing workers into the job is the name of the game. The first week is the\ntime to start giving them real responsibilities, however.\n\nWhile you'll want to turn workers loose sooner rather than later, doing so too\nsoon can create problems. That's why many workplaces have found mentoring or\nother programs to be beneficial.\n\n### **Bringing In a Mentor**\n\n![Two women working together at a\ndesk](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Two\nwomen working together at a desk](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1070271494-1600x1067.jpg)\n\nNo one should have to go it alone.\n\nHaving some sort of mentor relationship can be beneficial to new hires.\n\nBut there are many routes you can take for the designated contact within the\ndepartment. Choosing the one that's right will require getting to know the\nemployee's personality type and matching him or her with someone who has\nsimilar attitudes.\n\n    * **Peer mentors.** Some people will be naturally comfortable working with and talking to an employee who's around the same age and experience level. For instance, a recent college grad might be more at ease if their contact is a younger employee who had started working for your company recently as well. Likewise, someone who has been working in the field for a while but is new to your organization might appreciate being paired with someone who is also more experienced.\n    *  **Veteran mentors.** If you feel like a new employee could use an expert to consult with and get guidance from, a veteran mentor could be a better fit. Find someone who is knowledgeable about the industry and your company, has a solid track record and is willing to spend some time giving guidance.\n    *  **Shadows.** If you don't think an employee needs a formal mentor, a shadow may be the next best bet. Have new employees follow and observe someone while they do their job. Then have the shadow turn around and help observe the new employee, as well, once he or she's ready to start doing work solo. Shadow employees should be ones who are patient, sticklers for following procedures and who have proven track records.\n    *  **Independent mentors.** Sometimes, it can be uncomfortable for new employees to be paired with someone they'll be working closely with.\n\nConsider having a veteran employee who isn't necessarily on the same line or\nin the same department check in with the employee once a day about 15 minutes\nbefore quitting time.\n\nThis mentor can be a trusted, confidential person to talk to about any\nconcerns a new hire might have. It'll also boost the new employee's confidence\nby giving him or her someone to ask questions to without fear of looking\n\"dumb\" or confused. It's also a good way to get questions answered that aren't\nso crucial they need to be asked immediately.\n\n### **Getting Started Again**\n\nYou'll want to greet the new employee on their second day just like you did on\nthe first. Then get them started on a simple assignment right off the bat.\n\nFor instance, if they'll be working with customers, have them call up a few\ncurrent customers and give them a quality survey to complete over the phone.\nIf they're going to be working on the floor, have them observe the goings on\nand answer questions about what they observed after the shift ends.\n\nThese smaller assignments will help new employees get a feel for your company\nand a taste of the kinds of things they'll be doing when they're starting in\nfull.\n\nNote: Your company may have specific safety, privacy or other training that\nneeds to be completed before work is to begin. Obviously, these should be\ncompleted before work begins.\n\n### **Start With the Hardest Parts**\n\nSome employers are reluctant to give difficult projects to newer hires. But\nthe truth is, experience is a great teacher. Within the first few days, new\nemployees should be trying to tackle more difficult tasks.\n\nAfter the initial assignment, get them to work right away on something bigger\nand more complicated.\n\nWhy? For one thing, it's why they were brought on. If you spend too long\ngetting them up to speed with busy work or smaller assignments, you're not\ngetting the most out of an employee. This isn't a summer intern: It's someone\nyou'll be trusting to propel your organization to greatness.\n\nBesides, it's what good employees want. Believe it or not, a big reason many\npeople leave their jobs is that they don't find them challenging enough. If\nthey feel the job is going to be nothing but simple introductory tasks,\nworkers will be unlikely to think it's on their level of expertise.\n\nOn the other hand, compare that to telling a new worker: \"We're about to give\nyou a big project. We know you can do it, and we'll give you the tools and\nhelp you need to be a success.\"\n\nThis puts trust in the worker, inspiring him or her to rise to a challenge.\nIt's much more rewarding to hear you're trusted than to feel as if you need to\nearn the right to be trusted.\n\n### **Group Projects or Individual Assignments?**\n\n![Asain woman smiling at male coworker at\ndesk](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Asain\nwoman smiling at male coworker at desk](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-926404164-1600x1067.jpg)\n\nThere are two schools of thought on the best kinds of assignments for new\nemployees.\n\nThe first is that it's best to start them with a group project. This will help\nthem get to know their co-workers, contribute to the team and start working on\na big assignment right out of the gate.\n\nThe other is that individual assignments are best. These are an opportunity to\nsee what workers can do when they're given individual responsibilities. It's a\ngood way to find out what they're capable of.\n\nWhich method is best? It depends on the worker. But both methods should be\ngiven a shot, if possible.\n\nIt's a good way to evaluate a new hire's strengths and weaknesses - and to\nfind the best fit for him or her within the company.\n\n### **Getting Them Involved**\n\nIn addition to the first work assignments they're given, this is an ideal time\nto get employees involved in the company's culture.\n\nMake sure fresh employees are educated and recruited to some of the\nopportunities not directly related to their jobs.\n\nDo you have a company softball or bowling team? Does your organization support\nvolunteering or charity opportunities? Is there a safety or party- planning\ncommittee?\n\nThese are the kinds of things that get employees to stick around. If they\nstarted shopping around for a new job or decided to leave, they wouldn't just\nbe leaving a company - they'd also be leaving responsibilities and fun events\nbehind.\n\nEven better, these little bonuses get employees to want to stay with a\ncompany. When you're on a committee or a team, you build bonds with co-workers\nthat can be difficult to form just by chatting on coffee breaks or between\ntasks.\n\nSome companies will make joining extracurriculars mandatory. But coercing\nsomeone into volunteering their time won't win you much goodwill.\n\nA better approach is to sell them on the benefits. Many new workers are\nnaturally a little shy at first, but getting employees to sign up for a\nprogram doesn't have to be a tough sell.\n\nLet them know it's not only a good way to get to know their co-workers and the\ncompany, it's also a good opportunity to show they're team players and take a\nreal interest in the organization.\n\nIt never hurts to point out that if nothing else, it's a good way to get in\nsome face time with higher-ups.\n\n### **Onboarding Review Process**\n\nChances are your employees will think they're done with onboarding before they\nactually are. Studies show that employees think they're fully on- board after\nthree and a half weeks.\n\nBut most managers say new employees aren't fully onboard until three months\nafter their first day.\n\nThat makes this the perfect time for a brief performance review. In addition\nto your semi-regular chats and check-ins with employees, you should have this\nsit-down review session to discuss their progress and give valuable feedback.\n\nThese sessions should cover three main areas of interest:\n\n    * Discussing how far the employee has come\n    * Outlining what areas can be improved upon and should be targeted in the coming months, and\n    * Evaluating how the employee's role may need to change.\n\nUnlike informal check-ins, this meeting should be well-documented and planned.\nBe sure to have the employee mention any concerns he or she might have about\nthe job and work with him or her to set goals for the remainder of the year.\n\nAlso, speak with the employee's co-workers and other supervisors to find out\nhow he or she is progressing. Look for both strong suits and areas for\nimprovement so you can provide concrete examples of what needs work.\n\nUnofficially, this should mark the transition where the new employee has\nearned his or her wings and fills a role that's almost indistinguishable from\nmost others.\n\n### **Bringing New Employees Together**\n\n![Shot of happy colleagues shaking hands in a modern\noffice](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Shot\nof happy colleagues shaking hands in a modern\noffice](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-654186932-1600x1271.jpg)\n\nA good way to complete onboarding for new employees is to have them meet\ntogether in a group.\n\nTry having a \"Traditions\" course. This course would be held as needed and\nrequired for all new hires.\n\nEmployees would meet each other (if they haven't already) and learn a little\nmore about the company. Some sessions to consider:\n\n    * **Breakfast and Q &A with the CEO.** Have new hires meet and talk with the leader of the organization. This is a good way to get them acquainted with the highest level in the company (and to let leaders get to know the newest additions to their workplace).\n    *  **Your history.** Devote a session to explaining the history of your organization, how it's grown and changed over the years and what's next for it. This lets employees find out a little more about their employer and gives them some historical perspective of the company.\n    *  **Who 's who.** Have departmental leaders and supervisors give brief rundowns of what they do and how it fits into the big picture of the organization. Let employees fire off questions to these workers so they can make the connections personal.\n    *  **Book club.** Have new employees prepare for the session by reading the same article or section of a business book you find particularly helpful. Then have them discuss what they learned from it and how they can carry its message into their professional lives.\n    *  **Team-building exercises.** There are any number to choose from, but the best ones will be those that tie into your organization. For instance, you could have employees work in teams to come up with a possible improvement your company could make. Then have them take their idea to the department leaders they've met and find out whether or not it could benefit their department.\n\n## The Final Step\n\nSo how did your onboarding plan go? Was it everything your employee needed?\nToo much? Too little?\n\nThese are questions that can best be answered by the employees who have most\nrecently been hired and gone through the process.\n\nSolicit feedback from your employees after they've completed an onboarding\nprocess (sometime around their one-year anniversary with the company would be\nbest).\n\nFind out whether it met their needs and if it helped them to understand:\n\n    * The organization's history\n    * The most critical information about the office\n    * Key stakeholders and their respective roles\n    * Whom to go to with questions or problems\n    * Information on benefits, policies, etc., and\n    * The company's culture and values.\n\nUse the feedback and answers newly hired employees give you to evaluate,\nredesign or tweak your onboarding tactics. A good onboarding program isn't\nstatic: It should grow and change, just as a company and its employees do.\n\nYou may also want to ask employees who are leaving your organization - whether\nit's years after their start date or a few short weeks - their opinions of the\nonboarding process matter.\n\nIf it stuck with them over a long period of time, then those opinions are\nlikely meaningful.\n\n#### Keep Up To Date with the Latest HR News\n\nWith HRMorning arriving in your inbox, you will never miss critical stories on\nlabor laws, benefits, retention and onboarding strategies.\n\nSign up for a free HRMorning membership and get our newsletter!\n\n    * Email*\n\n    * username*\n\n    * formOffer\n\n    * businessUnit\n\n    * businessUnitId\n\n    * brand\n\n    * brandId\n\n    * event*\n\n    * controlCode\n\n    * Email\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\nThis iframe contains the logic required to handle Ajax powered Gravity Forms.\n\n[ ![HR Morning\nLogo](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![HR\nMorning Logo](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/themes/genesis/assets/images/logo-white@2x.png) ]()\n\n    * [Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/HRMorning)\n    * [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/HRMorning)\n    * [Linked In ](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4898679/)\n\n    * [ABOUT HRMORNING](https://www.hrmorning.com/about/)\n    * [ADVERTISE WITH US](https://www.hrmorning.com/advertise-with-us/)\n    * [WRITE FOR US](https://www.hrmorning.com/write-for-hr-morning/)\n    * [CONTACT](https://www.hrmorning.com/contact/)\n\n    * [Employment Law](/pbp-categories/employment-law/)\n    * [Benefits](/pbp-categories/benefits/)\n    * [Recruiting](/pbp-categories/recruiting/)\n    * [Talent Management](/pbp-categories/talent-management/)\n    * [HR Technology](/pbp-categories/hr-technology/)\n    * [Performance Management](/pbp-categories/performance-management/)\n    * [Leadership & Strategy](/pbp-categories/leadership-strategy/)\n    * [Compensation & Payroll](/pbp-categories/compensation-payroll)\n    * [Policy & Culture](/pbp-categories/policy-culture/)\n    * [Staff Administration](/pbp-categories/staff-administration/)\n    * [Wellness & Safety](/pbp-categories/wellness-safety/)\n    * [Staff Departure](/pbp-categories/staff-departure/)\n    * [Employee Services](/pbp-categories/employee-services/)\n    * [Work Location](/pbp-categories/work-location/)\n    * [HR Career & Self-Care](/pbp-categories/hr-career/)\n\nHRMorning, part of the Catalyst Media Network, provides the latest HR and\nemployment law news for HR professionals in the trenches of small-to-medium-\nsized businesses.

are an indispensable resource \u2013 and in this competitive hiring\nmarket, companies can\u2019t afford turnover. So now more than ever, businesses\nmust work on retaining their best employees to ensure they\u2019re running as\neffectively and efficiently as possible.\n\nThere are many ways companies can do this, but getting started out of the gate\nwith a thorough and [welcoming onboarding\nprocess](https://www.hrmorning.com/news/5-simple-ways-to-make-your-new-hire-\nfeel-welcome/) is one of the best ways to show your employees what they mean\nto your business. They\u2019ll know that you value them and they\u2019ll be eager to\nstick around longer.\n\nOf course, onboarding can be time-consuming, but luckily, the latest [HR\ntechnology](https://www.hrmorning.com/hr-technology/) can help you establish a\nsystematized approach to onboarding while carefully monitoring all of its\nimportant aspects.\n\nHere are five ways investing on automation in your onboarding process can help\nyou retain your top talent:\n\n# Establish a single source of communication\n\nThe fast pace of modern tech development has made it difficult for companies\nto keep track of all the channels where they can find new employees.\nOftentimes, candidates will contact businesses through multiple channels when\nsearching for jobs making it challenging to track communication and new\napplicants throughout all the platforms. Additionally, it\u2019s difficult to\nassess potential employees and manage them for proper onboarding.\n\nTo help with this process, you can use software solutions like [assessment\nsoftware](https://www.proprofs.com/quiz-school/solutions/assessment-software/)\nto store and manage applications in a single database. That way, you won\u2019t\nhave to work across multiple platforms.\n\n# Automate sourcing and screening tasks\n\nArtificial intelligence is making its way into various software solutions like\napplicant tracking systems, time clock software, and others. And when it comes\nto onboarding and hiring new employees, it can help HR pros immensely. Here is\nhow:\n\n## Giving responses to applicants\n\nWhen there\u2019s a large volume of applicants, like with bulk hiring, onboarding\nmanagers may find it a challenge to respond to all of them. In these\nsituations, an AI-powered onboarding software can help generate proper\nresponses and send them automatically.\n\n## Performing sourcing and screening\n\nAI software can also help with screening and sourcing. Through its\nunderstanding of job requirements, it can look for candidates that meet the\ncriteria, shortlist them and rank them properly. This allows managers to\nquickly determine which candidates to focus on first.\n\n## Getting all relevant information\n\nAI has the power to gather information about candidates and store it in a\nstructured manner. This structure makes it easier for HR reps to assess\ncandidates based on the stored data.\n\n# Evaluate candidate qualifications\n\nOne of the more tedious tasks for hiring managers is to go through many\napplications and narrow down the list to people who are qualified to do the\njob. Modern technology gives HR managers the information they need to evaluate\ncandidates based on knowledge, skills, experience, employment, history and\nother relevant information \u2013 all displayed on one dashboard. From there, they\ncan take it one candidate at a time.\n\n## Sorting applicants\n\nSome HR solutions come with features, functionalities and options that make\ntesting candidates easier, giving objective results that can tell managers\nwhether someone would be a good fit for the company. Instead of just relying\non their subjective opinions, managers can use these solutions to give\nunbiased scores and make better hiring decisions.\n\nFurthermore, these tools allow managers to sort candidates using different\ncriteria such as:\n\n    * Career achievements \n    * Portfolios \n    * Education level \n    * Various demographic factors \n    * Work experience \n\n## Selecting top candidates\n\nEven though applicants are already sorted neatly, it\u2019s important to narrow\ndown the list and choose only the candidates who best match your requirements.\nTo do this, you will have to evaluate them in a meaningful way. A software\nsolution can save time at this step by providing personalized aptitude test\nfeatures and quiz makers you can use for your evaluations.\n\n# Improve employee onboarding\n\nTechnology can help speed up the onboarding process by automating manual tasks\nthat are time-consuming. Automation allows managers to send out all\napplications and onboarding forms to new hires as soon as they get the job so\nthat employees get all the paperwork done before coming in to work. At the\nsame time, the software can send onboarding managers notifications about which\nemployees have finished their documentation and which haven\u2019t.\n\nWith these more monotonous tasks out of the way, onboarding managers can focus\non more important aspects of onboarding: They can engage new hires, tell them\nabout their new workplace and get to know them better.\n\n# Follow-up\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to make the onboarding process smooth, the story of\nretaining employees doesn\u2019t end there. After someone has joined your team,\nfollow up with proper practices to keep them engaged.\n\n## Providing employee development\n\nTo most employees, the prospect of growing as professionals and acquiring new\nskills is just as important as the work they\u2019re doing. With the help of HR\ntraining software,  or [learning management\nsolutions](https://www.hrmorning.com/articles/lms-learning-management-\nsystem/), managers can instantly offer lessons, courses, and training. With\ntraining software, it\u2019s easier to create personalized training and adjust it\nto the employees\u2019 level of knowledge.\n\n## Getting feedback from your employees\n\nListening to your employees is essential as it shows that you value their\nopinions and promote transparency within your company culture. [HR training\nsoftware](https://www.proprofs.com/training/solutions/hr-training-software/)\ncan be used to gather feedback about courses and other essential issues. This\ninformation is then shared privately with the manager.\n\nEstablishing good onboarding practices will not only help your business handle\nthe hiring process more efficiently, but it will also help you choose the\nright people and [retain them](https://hbr.org/2012/11/five-ways-to-retain-\nemployees). Engaged employees will stay a lot longer because they find their\nwork meaningful in some way \u2013 so grabbing their attention right at the\nonboarding process will go a long way in keeping them satisfied.  \n\nIn this digital age, using modern software solutions that offer advanced\nfunctionalities can advance your business in a lot of ways. While it can be a\nbit of an investment, training software and onboarding platforms will pay for\nthemselves in the end by freeing up busy HR professionals to focus on the more\n\u2018human\u2019 elements of the job.  \n\n![Kamy Anderson, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Kamy\nAnderson, HR Expert\nContributor](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)![Kamy\nAnderson, HR Expert Contributor](https://s29937.pcdn.co/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/andersonbio-150x150.jpg)\n\n[Kamy Anderson, HR Expert\nContributor](https://www.hrmorning.com/author/kamyandersonhrmorning-com/)\n\nKamy Anderson is an ed-tech enthusiast with a passion for writing on emerging\ntechnologies in corporate training and education.

And just\nlike any other aspect of work or life, onboarding is experiential,\" said\nJackson.\n\n\"Onboarding doesn't begin when a new hire signs the contract and ends when\nthey walk our of the induction room on day one.\n\n\"It's an experience that starts the moment they hear about an opportunity and\ncontinues throughout their first year.\"\n\nJackson added that fortnight -- even a month -- isn't nearly enough time to\ngrasp the complexities of a new company; understanding individual roles and\nhow they fit into the bigger picture.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637213360039891507.jpg)](/us/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218599)\n\n#### [COVID-19: HR's main challenges revealed](/us/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218599)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637215281510472121.jpg)](/us/news/general/boeing-\noffers-workers-voluntary-layoff-option/218890)\n\n#### [Boeing offers workers 'voluntary' layoff\noption](/us/news/general/boeing-offers-workers-voluntary-layoff-option/218890)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0223_637214253526069773.jpg)](/us/news/general/global-\nfirm-to-help-develop-medical-equipment-for-covid-19/218734)\n\n#### [Global firm to help develop medical equipment for\nCOVID-19](/us/news/general/global-firm-to-help-develop-medical-equipment-for-\ncovid-19/218734)\n\n\"And by neglecting to actively facilitate this process, people are left\nfeeling confused and lost, discouraged and disconnected. None of which builds\na better culture.\"\n\nAccording to Jackson, better onboarding experiences require a shift in focus\nin the following four areas:\n\n**Logical to emotional**  \nAbove all, onboarding should consider people's emotions at every stage of the\nprocess. This allows organisations to manage emotions and expectations, and\nmeet people's needs by delivering the right content through the right channels\nat the right time.\n\nFor example, the weeks leading up to starting a new job are an opportunity to\namplify excitement, mitigate anxiety and uncertainty, and manage expectations.\nWhat do people need to know before their first day at work to ensure it goes\nsmoothly? It can seem obvious until it's mapped out in detail, revealing small\nfriction points that can have a significant emotional impact.\n\nAn experiential approach to onboarding goes beyond delivering the bare minimum\nto do the job, to considering how people experience their first week, month\nand year.  \n\n**Process to people**  \nBeyond the essential information needed to do the job, onboarding is an\nopportunity to build connection with peers, leaders, work and the\norganisation.\n\nWeaving in cultural elements -- the vision, mission, values, norms, behaviours\nand rituals -- in the early stages, takes onboarding beyond improving how\nindividuals work, to strengthening the way in which people work together\ntowards a common purpose.\n\n**Highly administrative to highly automated**  \nThere's a misconception that an intensive onboarding experience requires a\nhigh administrative burden. However, we're well beyond the days of manually\nsending forms and contracts, organising police and medical checks, entering\ndata and ordering equipment.\n\nMany platforms allow tasks to be automated, ensuring a consistent experience\nwithout placing pressure on particular people or functions. This doesn't mean\nremoving the human element from onboarding. Quite the opposite, by taking care\nof the mundane but necessary touchpoints, there's more time to focus on the\nmeaningful interactions.\n\nAutomation could involve triggering reminders for busy managers to have\nimportant face to face conversations at regular intervals. It could be a\nwelcome video from a manager sent the week before starting work.\n\nThese are small moments that make a big difference, but can easily be\nforgotten amidst the day-to-day.\n\n**Incongruent to congruent**  \nAs the first experience people have with the organisation, onboarding plays a\ncrucial role in delivering on the promises of the employer brand, and should\nfeel coherent with the overall employee experience.\n\nTo provide a consistent experience, end-to-end across various touchpoints,\nrequires collaboration between various functions, including People and\nCulture, Safety, Finance, and Legal, as well as external vendors. Every\ntouchpoint should feel like part of the same experience, rather than haphazard\ncommunication from different sources.  \n\nThe real challenge for global businesses is delivering an onboarding\nexperience that's coherent with the organisation, but also considers region-\nand site-specific factors.\n\nThese include cultural context and regional demographics, down to operational\nnuances between different sites and facilities. This level of detail maintains\nconsistency, while also ensuring relevance.\n\nBy approaching onboarding from an experience-led perspective, considering\nemotions, people, automation and congruence, leaders can build better\nonboarding experiences, and better cultures as a result.\n\n### Related stories\n\n  * [Onboarding at its core: What HR professionals need to know](/us/specialization/employee-engagement/onboarding-at-its-core-what-hr-professionals-need-to-know/193392)\n  * [Onboarding: What HR professionals need to know](/ca/specialization/employee-engagement/onboarding-what-hr-professionals-need-to-know/193371)\n\n### Free newsletter\n\nOur daily newsletter is FREE and keeps you up-to-date with the world of HR.\nPlease complete the form below and click on subscribe for daily newsletters\nfrom HRD America.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the [comments powered by\nDisqus.](https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript)\n\n### Recent articles & video\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218756963772601.jpg)](/us/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219163)\n\n#### [How has COVID-19 impacted managers and employees?](/us/news/general/how-\nhas-covid-19-impacted-managers-and-employees/219163)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637218753186012580.jpg)](/us/news/general/ceo-\nof-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-from-a-challenge/219157)\n\n#### [CEO of HP Canada: 'I was never one to shy away from a\nchallenge'](/us/news/general/ceo-of-hp-canada-i-was-never-one-to-shy-away-\nfrom-a-challenge/219157)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/036/0248_637217682606769111.jpg)](/us/specialization/learning-\ndevelopment/how-to-manage-stress-in-your-business/219011)\n\n#### [How to manage stress in your business](/us/specialization/learning-\ndevelopment/how-to-manage-stress-in-your-business/219011)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/037/0223_637215285741068442.jpg)](/us/news/general/the-\nperks-and-pitfalls-of-working-from-home/218899)\n\n#### [The perks and pitfalls of working from home](/us/news/general/the-perks-\nand-pitfalls-of-working-from-home/218899)\n\n### Most Read Articles\n\n#### [COVID-19: HR's main challenges revealed](/us/news/general/covid-19-hrs-\nmain-challenges-revealed/218599)\n\n01 Apr 2020\n\n#### [Boeing offers workers 'voluntary' layoff\noption](/us/news/general/boeing-offers-workers-voluntary-layoff-option/218890)\n\n03 Apr 2020\n\n#### [Global firm to help develop medical equipment for\nCOVID-19](/us/news/general/global-firm-to-help-develop-medical-equipment-for-\ncovid-19/218734)\n\n02 Apr 2020\n\n__\n\n  * [HRT](https://www.hrtechnologynews.com/)\n  * [Companies](/us/companies)\n  * [People](/us/people)\n  * [Newsletter](/us/newsletter)\n\n  * [About us](/us/about-us)\n  * [Authors](/us/authors)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/us/privacy-policy)\n  * [Conditions of use](/us/conditions-of-use)\n  * [Contact us](/us/contact-us)\n  * [RSS __](/us/rss)\n\n[__](https://www.facebook.com/HRM-\nAmerica-1426260234270128/)[__](https://twitter.com/HRDAmerica)[__](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hrm-\namerica)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Key Media ![](/images/footer_logo.png)\n\n"}, {"item": "Is Onboarding The New HR Secret For Company Success? - Forbes", "link": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2019/01/25/is-onboarding-the-new-hr-secret-for-company-success/", "guid": "CAIiEP2liDlIbIg4Hg77-lyG4xwqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowrqkBMKBFMKGBAg", "pubdate": "Fri, 25 Jan 2019 13:28:59 GMT", "description": "<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2019/01/25/is-onboarding-the-new-hr-secret-for-company-success/\" target=\"_blank\">Is Onboarding The New HR Secret For Company Success?</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">Forbes</font>", "source": "Forbes", "body": "Sign in to your Forbes account or\n\nregister\n\n## Please help us continue to provide you with free, quality journalism by\nturning off your ad blocker on our site.\n\nFor instructions on how to disable your ad blocker, [click\nhere.](https://www.forbes.com/adblock/instructions/)\n\n[I\u2019ve Turned Off My Ad\nBlocker](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/2019/01/25/is-onboarding-\nthe-new-hr-secret-for-company-success/)\n\nOr Sign In To Continue Using An Ad Blocker\n\n### Thank you for signing in.\n\nIf this is your first time registering, please check your inbox for more\ninformation about the benefits of your Forbes account and what you can do\nnext!\n\n  * I agree to receive occasional updates and announcements about Forbes products and services.

But onboarding is\nmuch more than a checklist, more than an information package and more than an\nintroduction program. Unstructured Onboarding is bad for business and bad for\npeople and companies who take a proactive approach to Onboarding are seeing\ngreat results.\n\nToday In: [Leadership Strategy](https://www.forbes.com/leadership-strategy)\n\n  * [\n\n### Judges Slap Down USCIS Again On H-1B Visas\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2020/04/08/judges-slap-down-\nuscis-again-on-h-1b-visas/)\n\n  * [\n\n### We Are In The Grips Of A Global Pandemic.

The following facts says it all:\n\n  * 25% of new hires leave their company within the first 12 month.\n  * 48% of new hires in their first job have moved on within the first 18 month.\n  * The average onboarding time to performance is 6,2 months for new hires.\n  * The cost of losing a new employee within the first 12 month equals 2 years of salary.\n  * The average tenure for the new generation is below 2 years so you need to get your new hires up to speed faster than before.\n  * Companies with structured and standardized onboarding processes experience 54% higher productivity from their newly employed and twice as high level of engagement.\n\nThese results underline the business case for Onboarding. Companies who work\nwith a professional approach will get faster time-to-performance, increase\nretention rates, get higher employee engagement, reduce stress and sick days,\nand build a better Employer Brand and Reputation.\n\n**Rogers:** What comprises a good Onboarding process?\n\n**Harpelund:** Good onboarding involves three tracks and six dimensions. First\nof all, you need a framework for your Onboarding activities which covers the\ntracks of forming, connection and unfolding the new employees into your\norganization. This include focus on activities within 6 dimensions of\nOnboarding: culture, rules, network, collaboration, competencies, and\nperformance. The Onboarding Model is rooted in motivational theory and\nintegrates perfectly with employee and leadership development.\n\nTo successfully onboard new employees they should be integrated across these\nsix dimensions, combining training, team meetings, one-to-one dialogue and\nwork assignments in a fast, effective, and structured onboarding process \u2013 all\nthis is based on a data-driven approach.\n\n**Rogers:** What can companies do now to develop a better Onboarding process?\n\n**Harpelund:** To move the company towards a structured and more\nprofessionalized Onboarding process, companies need to take control of the\nprocess and answer these business questions:\n\n  * How does your current Onboarding design fit your strategy and the needs of the organization across the six onboarding dimensions?\n  * What is the current level of onboarding activities and procedures, both corporate and local \u2013 and what are the ambitions going forward?\n  * How many new hires do you have right now in your organization and how many are already looking to leave our company because of a bad onboarding experience?\n\nOur global research tells us, that structured Onboarding is by far the most\nunnoticed discipline in HR Management today and the one with the most\npotential to solve one of the biggest global challenges for public and private\ncompanies: To retain and attract new employees.\n\n**Rogers:** Tell us about the book you and your colleagues recently published\non the topic?\n\n**Harpelund:** In 2015 we gathered some of the most talented and experienced\npeople within Recruitment, HR and Business Intelligence and established\nOnboarding Group with a clear mission to improve onboarding and work life\ntransitions for as many people as possible. Together we have completed the\nmost extensive and we believe comprehensive study around onboarding and put it\ninto the book: _Onboarding: Getting New Hires off to a Flying Start_. We have\nwritten the book for companies and HR professionals who want to improve the\nintegration of new hires into their companies.\n\nOnboarding: Getting New Hires Off To A Flying Start, Published by Emerald\nPublishing\n\nOnboarding Group\n\nWe believe that every employee deserves the opportunity to become successful\nin their job - to feel a fuller sense of meaning with their working life.\nWithout a flying start in a new job, chances are that person will not deliver\non expectations and will not feel their work is meaningful. This is a vital\ntask for any HR department and manager. It helps create a meaningful working\nlife for people and helps them to succeed. And with the individual success of\neach employee, you help companies grow and reach their goals. In this way,\nonboarding of new hires is critical for success.\n\n**Rogers:** Thank you.\n\n\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/@brogers825).\n\n[![Bruce Rogers](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/brucerogers/files/2016/01/Bruce-\nRogers_avatar_1453726662-400x400.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/\n\"Photo of Bruce Rogers\")\n\n[Bruce Rogers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucerogers/)\n\nI am the SVP of Marketing at G/O Media.

CVS Pharmacy, for instance, said Monday it is hiring 50,000 full-\ntime workers -- and in a pandemic-friendly way. It will hire using \"virtual\njob fairs, virtual interviews and virtual job tryouts,\" it said.\n\nUnemployment claims are soaring, and there is no doubt that the coronavirus\noutbreak is having an [ugly\neffect](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252478113/Gartner-\nPrepare-pandemic-planning-around-25-absenteeism) on the job market. But\nthere's another side to the economic fallout: Firms are [trying to avoid\nlayoffs](https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/news/252480950/DataRobot-\nlayoffs-come-after-years-of-growth) and some hiring continues -- nearly all of\nit with the help of virtual hiring tools.\n\nIn research conducted late last week, 49% of the 800 firms Gartner surveyed\nhave imposed a hiring freeze. But only about 8% of those firms have started a\ndownsizing process, said Brian Kropp, chief of HR research at Gartner.\n\nThe mindset of firms right now \"is the belief that this is going to be a\nquarter to maybe two-quarter problem, and not a year to two-year problem,\"\nKropp said.\n\n\"They are avoiding -- at all costs -- laying off employees,\" Kropp said. Firms\nare trying to do all they can to manage costs around different parts of the\nbusiness, he said.\n\nFor those firms that are hiring, virtual hiring tools are gaining ground. For\npeople seeking jobs at CVS, the firm provides a link to a [video\ninterviewing](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/video-\ninterview) platform from [HireVue\nInc](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/HireVue).\n\n### __Virtual hiring process\n\nThe CVS vetting process includes a \"[Virtual Job\nTryout](https://jobs.cvshealth.com/vjt?prefilters=none&CloudSearchLocation=none&CloudSearchValue=none).\"\nApplicants may get a \"situational judgment test\" that \"presents problem\nsituations.\" There are four possible responses; applicants pick their most\nlikely response and least likely response, according to the site.\n\nChallenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., an outplacement firm in Chicago, has\nsurveyed 200 companies beginning Friday and said 35% have instituted a hiring\nfreeze. It found that 48% of firms are conducting job interviews, and 78% of\nfirms that are hiring are conducting the process virtually.\n\n> They are avoiding -- at all costs -- laying off employees.  **Brian Kropp**\n> Chief of HR research, Gartner  __\n\n\"There's still this optimism among medium to large employers,\" said Andrew\nChallenger, senior vice president at Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\n\nThere is a belief that \"there's going to be a snap back in the economy at the\nend of this crisis,\" Challenger said. \"Companies went into the crisis on\npretty sound financial footing,\" he said.\n\nSome firms are furloughing employees and maintaining benefits for them. Doing\nso will enable employers to return them to work quickly, Challenger said.\n\nOnly 14% of firms are still doing in-person interviews, according to\nChallenger. Virtual interviewing is the preferred method now, he said.\n\nIn its survey, 57% of firms are still onboarding, or hiring workers.\n\n\"Businesses that rely on foot traffic are being deeply affected,\" Challenger\nsaid. \"But there is a segment of the economy that has [adapted to working from\nhome](https://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/Guide-to-telecommuting-\nduring-the-coronavirus-pandemic) and to conducting business virtually in a way\nthat allows them to stay moving forward.\"\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on Employee onboarding software\n\n  * [\n\n##### How companies can use tech to ramp up remote work productivity\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/meltzer_rachel.jpg) By: Rachel\nMeltzer ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/How-companies-can-use-\ntech-to-ramp-up-remote-work-productivity)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Farmers Insurance piloting human-like VR training\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252480754/Farmers-Insurance-\npiloting-human-like-VR-training)\n\n  * [\n\n##### How IT can back up ESG efforts to do environmental and social good\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/computerweekly/Cath-Everett-CW.jpg) By: Cath\nEverett ](https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/How-IT-can-back-up-ESG-\nefforts-to-do-environmental-and-social-good)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Gartner: Prepare pandemic planning around 25% absenteeism\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252478113/Gartner-Prepare-\npandemic-planning-around-25-absenteeism)\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [How Leaders in Education Can Modernize IT to Reduce Complexity](https://searchcio.techtarget.com/LiveOptics/How-Leaders-in-Education-Can-Modernize-IT-to-Reduce-Complexity) -DellEMC\n  * [The Next-Generation Workspace: Removing Barriers and Frustration](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/The-Next-Generation-Workspace-Removing-Barriers-and-Frustration) -Citrix\n  * [The Well-Trod Path From Application Virtualization to People-Centric Digital ...](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/The-Well-Trod-Path-From-Application-Virtualization-to-People-Centric-Digital-Workspaces) -Citrix\n  * [See More](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/sponsored_communities)\n\n__Related Content\n\n  * [Gartner analyst sees limit to tech's ability to fix ...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Gartner-analyst-sees-limit-to-techs-ability-to-fix-hiring-bias) - SearchHRSoftware\n  * [CEO commitment to upskilling employees may boost HR ...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/CEO-commitment-to-upskilling-employees-may-boost-HR-tech) - SearchHRSoftware\n  * [Employee development and performance hot topics at ...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/2240214367/Employee-development-and-performance-hot-topics-at-Oracle-HCM-World) - SearchHRSoftware\n\n####  __Join the conversation\n\n###  __ 1 comment\n\nSend me notifications when other members comment.

However, our experience in the legal field shows us that\nmost law firms are not hiring and not placing employees on furlough. Most of\nthe major law firms are on a 60+ day hiring freeze. We have seen a number of\nlayoffs as well. Law firms are conserving cash, anticipating downturn in\nrevenue and holding tight.\n\n  \n\nAdd My Comment Cancel\n\n  * [__  ](mailto:socialmedia@techtarget.com?subject=PLEASE REVIEW COMMENT 169252: Virtual hiring, avoiding layoffs part of HR's pandemic response&body=Please review a recent comment for inappropriate content.%0A%0AURL: https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252480594/Virtual-hiring-avoiding-layoffs-part-of-HRs-pandemic-response%0A%0AAuthor: chereestrin%0A%0AComment ID: 169252)\n\n## [-ADS BY\nGOOGLE](https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/request.py?contact=abg_afc)\n\n## Latest TechTarget resources\n\n  * SAP ____\n  * Oracle ____\n  * Business Analytics ____\n  * Content Management ____\n  * Data Management ____\n\n##  [ SearchSAP](https://searchsap.techtarget.com)\n\n  * __\n\n### [SAP Business One overview: Features, benefits and\nmore](https://searchsap.techtarget.com/feature/SAP-Business-One-overview-\nFeatures-benefits-and-more)\n\nSAP Business One promises holistic business management software.

Christine Trodella 7 minute Read\n\nThe remote worker is almost as old as the internet itself, so we've had more\nthan a couple of decades to learn how to manage employees who aren't\nphysically present. But as we see this trend increase, it's clear that\neffectively managing an employee whose \"office\" is in their home with an\ninternet connection and a computer doesn't mean that there's a truly symbiotic\nrelationship between a manager and their remote, work-from-home reports. It's\na lot more complicated than that. In fact, the learning curve has turned out\nto be steeper than any of us anticipated, and this specific employee group\ncontinues to be severely underrepresented despite their very unique needs.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nA [recent survey](https://www.facebook.com/workplace/blog/deskless-not-\nvoiceless) of 2,000 frontline workers and 2,000 managers in the U.S. and the\nU.K. shows that there is a major disconnect between workers on the front lines\nand business leaders. In fact, almost 90% of these employees feel connected to\ndirect coworkers, but less than 15% feel connected to HQ. Worse, just 3% feel\nconnected to their C-suite. That disconnect is affecting the bottom line. Less\nthan half of workers say they share ideas with senior team members, and more\nthan half say they feel voiceless. That can contribute to an environment where\nsuggestions go unsaid and innovative ideas are stifled.\n\nThese numbers provide some important food for thought. Are you at risk of\nlosing exceptional remote-based talent because you're unclear on how to best\nmanage and retain those workers, especially if your \"work from home\" policy\nextends longer than previously anticipated? (Which we know many companies are\nfacing now, with COVID-19 impacting businesses worldwide.) During a crisis--or\nif someone is at home with family, or sick, etc.--people may need to take a\nmore flexible approach. To better accommodate families and work in general\nduring these times, have frequent team check-ins to understand your team's\nneeds and be sensitive to their well-being.\n\nIt's time to meet these challenges head-on because the future is only getting\nmore distributed. Here's how leadership can navigate this evolving modern work\nenvironment and create an organization that values each employee.\n\n## Onboarding, training, and managing remote workers\n\nFor an in-office worker, the first day on the job is usually filled with\nintroductions, new equipment, and the crucial first lunch. But the first day\nfor remote workers looks very different.\n\nJust because a remote or deskless worker isn't at the office doesn't mean they\ndon't deserve the same onboarding experience and training as the rest of your\nteam. Send a welcome package in the mail along with necessary equipment (where\napplicable) and include a training schedule as well as some introductory\ninstructions (login information for work accounts, for example). Also include\nhandbooks and style guides. Assign a work mentor to whom the new employee can\nturn for help and advice. Better yet, take advantage of the tools at your\ndisposal, like creating a bot that will automate monthly check-ins, or create\na direct chat where you can take advantage of immediate, one-on-one feedback.\nEntire businesses can also benefit from newer technologies such as artificial\nintelligence, virtual reality, and more. We must be open to these ideas and be\nunafraid of pushing the boundaries of innovation that enable greater and more\ninteresting connections.\n\nFrom the beginning, managers of remote and distributed employees should be\nasking questions about preferences for minor things that make a big\ndifference, such as feedback style and meeting preferences (for example, do\nthey prefer videoconferencing for one-on-ones or group catch-ups?). Create a\n\"How I Work\" document and ask your direct reports to fill it out. You can\ncapture very important information, and it shows you're being mindful,\nthoughtful, and preferential to what works for them. It's also important to\nregularly communicate and check for context. When teams are dispersed, it is\ndifficult to know who has been exposed to project knowledge and updates, so\nreinforcing context in writing, during one-on-ones, and team meetings is\nimportant.\n\nadvertisement\n\nManagers should also make a list of where remote employees can find helpful\nresources, from important company updates to how to reach IT for technical\nissues. Ensure your organization has enterprise tools that are available on\nmobile devices and have little barrier to entry for frontline employees who\nmay not be in a home office.\n\n## Encourage engagement while your workforce is distributed\n\nThe old saying \"Out of sight, out of mind\" can certainly apply to those not in\nthe office. It's easy for remote workers to feel they aren't heard, and it can\nbe difficult to collaborate with people who aren't physically present.\n\nIt would seem obvious that the correct way to address this disconnect would be\nto invest heavily in collaboration tools. But the same survey shows that while\n95% of business leaders recognize the value of collaboration tools, only 56%\nhave rolled them out.\n\nIf your organization is serious about tapping into the potential of remote\nworkers, it needs to invest in the best technologies to make sure\ncollaboration tools are not just suggested but are incorporated into all\nprocesses to ensure that all workers, remote or at HQ, can have their\ncontributions equally seen and heard.\n\nSo why not make this a fun process for your workforce while they work\ndistributed? Perhaps make a company-wide \"work where you want\" day and have\nyour workers send a photo to your HR team for them to post on a company forum\nsomewhere to showcase all the different places and ways that your colleagues\nwork, best practices, or work-from-home hacks that colleagues can share with\neach other.\n\nRemote workers also need to be included in things such as all-hands meetings\nhosted by the CEO via videoconferencing and Q&As that can be watched live or\nbookmarked to view later in local time zones.\n\nadvertisement\n\n## Adapting to changing environments and work culture\n\nAs organizations become more global and increasingly mobile, leaders need new\nways to build, scale, and sustain culture across their organizations.\nTechnology is the key to creating an open, transparent culture. After all,\nwhen you connect people and give them access to information, you can change\nculture and transform your business. It's no surprise that working alone can\nbe isolating, so it's important to leverage the right technology that not only\nconnects everyone, but makes them feel physically present.\n\nHowever, technology is only one influential part here. The people make the\nlargest impact. If you have your mission and vision written on your website,\nprovide some swag for your remote workers to keep on their desks at home--for\ninstance, printed on a calendar, a water bottle, a notepad, etc. Remote\nworkers aren't just looking for a connection to each other but to the very\nvision they believed in when accepting their current role.\n\n## Helping change managers' mindsets about distributed/remote organizations\n\nManagers, executives, and C-suite leaders should focus on where the best\ntalent resides and realize that those employees may not always be located in\nthe corporate headquarters or local office. Alternatively, as the world\nchanges, it may be a safety precaution or requirement that must be taken and\nmay be prolonged due to unexpected conditions.\n\nThis means understanding that what's best for your organization may mean\nenabling workers across the globe who are best suited to meet your bottom\nline, assist your customers, and serve your business, from a desk or the front\nline. Leadership must embrace this as well and ensure that employees know that\nthe quality of their work will remain more important than the location they're\ngetting their work done. As leadership encourages a forward-thinking\norganization, you will retain and attract like-minded employees who end up\nbeing great colleagues.\n\nWhen there are annual meetings, remote and distributed employees need to be\nthere. And if they can't attend holiday functions, make sure to make them feel\nseen and valued by sending a treat (cookies can do wonders). Remember that all\nthe perks of being an in-office employee extend to distributed and remote\nemployees.\n\nWhen it comes to being a distributed organization, the benefits far outweigh\nthe challenges. The trick is to get strategic about the tools at your disposal\nand ensure your leadership team is equipped with a set of tools to best manage\ntheir direct reports, whether in-office or online. You'll also need to shift\nthe organization's mindset to recognize that teams extend beyond just the\npeople in the office.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLeadership teams and managers also need to ensure they're collecting feedback\nand sentiment about the distributed employees they manage. That will ensure\nthat corporate offices are aware of pain points and how to best incorporate\nand provide feedback with the goal of creating a unified, collaborative\nenvironment that prioritizes open communication and support.\n\nWhile we can't predict what will happen with the world in a few months, weeks,\nor days, we can follow the trends that point to the fact that remote workers\naren't going anywhere, and companies need to adapt to remain competitive.\nHopefully, leadership teams will equip managers with tools to feel heard,\ngather feedback, celebrate wins, understand work preferences, and ensure\nconnection to global headquarters.\n\n* * *\n\n _Christine Trodella is head of Americas at[Workplace

It also involves creating an\nenvironment in which the employee is made comfortable enough to interact\nfreely with their colleagues and establish social relationships in the\nworkplace.\n\nSpecifically, it involves getting the employee to complete the necessary\npaperwork for labor law compliance and equipping them with all the tools they\nneed to do their job well. During onboarding, employees learn what the\norganization expects from them in terms of skills, communication style, and\nattitude.\n\nWe read through a number of research papers and studies on onboarding and its\neffectiveness. The findings from all of them can be summarized in two key\npoints:\n\n  * Hiring is not only time-consuming, but it is also an expensive affair. \n  * Retaining employees depends on how these difficult-to-find employees are onboarded. If they are not onboarded optimally, you may lose them, and that will result in another expensive hiring cycle.\n\n  \nThe success of employee onboarding depends on the efficiency of the onboarding\nprogram. The quicker employees are empowered to do their jobs, the faster they\nare likely to become valuable, contributing members of the organization.\n\nOnboarding is not just HR\u2019s job. It also the responsibility of the immediate\nmanager, who will familiarize the employee with their role in the company,\ntheir performance expectations, and the culture of the team they are going to\nbe a part of.\n\nIn addition, onboarding is not only associated with new employees. Employees\nmove laterally into new roles, known as crossboarding (covered later in this\narticle), and they also need to be onboarded following a similar process.\nWhile they may be familiar with organizational culture, team culture may be\ndifferent. While they may be familiar with company policies, they may still\nneed a mentor to guide them through their new role.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to what the employee onboarding process entails.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **10 Employee Onboarding Checklist Items You Can't Afford to\nMiss**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/employee-onboarding-checklist/)\n\n## **The Employee Onboarding Process: How to Onboard Employees**\n\nWhen a prospective employee accepts an offer letter, they officially become a\npart of the organization. The following steps are what make up the onboarding\nprocess.\n\n![Follow these steps to onboard employees](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. Follow these steps to onboard employees**\n\n### **1\\. Provide information on company policies and benefits**\n\n  \nProvide comprehensive information about policies and employee benefits on the\nemployee\u2019s first day in the organization. The training session or materials\nshould include everything from compliance to insurance to tax liabilities to\ncompany policies on leaves and diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn this step, also have the employee sign all the compliance forms that\nformally validate them as members of the organization.\n\nDepending on the country you are in, if **[digital\nsignatures](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/how-digital-signatures-improve-the-employee-onboarding-\nexperience/)** are accepted on state/federal compliance forms, you can use\nemployee onboarding software to share the necessary documentation with new\nemployees before their first day in the company. This means they can complete\nall compliance formalities beforehand and become contributing members of the\nteam right from day one.\n\nUsing digital signatures is also helpful when you have to onboard remote\nemployees into the company.\n\n### **2\\. Provide role clarity**\n\n  \nWhat exactly is an employee expected to do as part of their job? A breakdown\nof all their daily tasks is important to help them gain clarity about their\nrole.\n\n_Who communicates this information?_ This is the best time for the manager to\nstep into the onboarding process, as they are best positioned to offer a clear\npicture of what an employee\u2019s role will involve.\n\nThis information should be provided over the first 30 days on the job, as the\nnew employee learns and slowly takes ownership of their role. In this process,\nit is also important to inform the employee of whom they must collaborate with\nto get their job done \u2013 members of their own teams as well as members of other\nteams \u2013 along with the reporting matrix for such collaborations.\n\nWith an automated solution such as Bamboo HR, new employees can be introduced\nto members of their team and supporting teams much before they join the\norganization. These employee onboarding software solutions allow each team\nmember to create an online profile, which a new employee can go through to\nlearn more about their team members. Similarly, employees can create their own\nprofile and introduce themselves to their team members much before they join\nthe organization.\n\nEven in the case of cross boarding, you can share the employee\u2019s profile\nbeforehand.\n\n_The benefit?_ There is already a certain amount of familiarity and\nfriendliness between the employee and their colleagues right from day one.\n\n### **3\\. Facilitate training**\n\n  \nTraining is part of the long-term onboarding process and is best facilitated\nby the immediate manager. Even the most experienced employee needs to be\nprovided with a training period to understand how processes function in their\nnew organization or new team.\n\nCompanies can start delivering this training even before employees\u2019 first day\nat the organization. Basic training materials can be sent across, and\nemployees can be given a breakdown of the tasks they are expected to\naccomplish through **[employee onboarding\nsoftware](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nemployee-onboarding-software/)**.\n\nHibob\u2019s employee onboarding software allows HR to set up customized workflows\nfor new employees, giving them a sense of what\u2019s in store for them when they\nenter the company.\n\nBoardon is also a pre-onboarding software that allows you to use the time\nbefore the onboarding efficiently.\n\nFreshteam is an all-in-one hiring, onboarding, and employee data management\nsolution that can help you streamline the entire onboarding process.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How to Strengthen the Relationship Between Recruiting and\nOnboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/how-to-strengthen-the-relationship-between-recruiting-and-\nonboarding/)\n\n### **4\\. Induct into organizational culture**\n\n  \nAssimilation into organizational culture is an ongoing process. However, HR\nmanagers and team managers must give an employee a broad overview of the\nculture when they join the company.\n\n_How can they do this?_ One way is to make sure that culture is reflected in\nthe company vision and mission statement.\n\nIs your organization output-oriented or outcome-oriented?\n\nHow easy is it for your employees to come up to you and discuss a problem\nthey\u2019re experiencing at work?\n\nHow open are managers to entertaining non-work conversations?\n\nDefine what the company culture stands for, and then ensure this culture is\ncommunicated to the new employee.\n\nYou can also do this through your onboarding software, which gives new hires\ndirect insights into the team members, the profile of the company, and as a\nresult, an insight into the culture of your organization.\n\n### **5\\. Help form social connections with colleagues**\n\n  \nWhile this is not entirely the responsibility of the manager/HR, it is their\njob to facilitate communication between employees, even if some employees are\nnot very open to integrating. This involves creating an environment where\nfriendships between colleagues are encouraged.\n\nA lot of organizations employ the system of new-hire buddies, where they\ndedicate one employee to help the new employee navigate the workplace \u2013 from\njob-related tasks to administrative queries and everything in between.\n\nHowever, a Hibob survey found that 49% of the employees surveyed would rather\nmake friends with their coworkers instead of limiting their interactions to\ntheir new-hire buddy.\n\nThis information, however, should not discount the value of a new-hire buddy.\nNot everyone is comfortable going up to their new coworkers and forging\nrelationships with them.\n\nIf new employees or team members have simple queries like how to work the\nprinter or whom to speak to for an ergonomic laptop stand, a new-hire buddy\ncan help easily. And in the age of AI, chatbots (discussed below) can serve as\ngreat new-hire buddies.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **3 Ways VR Can Transform Employee\nOnboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/3-ways-vr-can-transform-employee-onboarding/)\n\n## **What Is the Duration of Employee Onboarding?**\n\n\u201cIn our recent Hibob survey, we found that a majority of new hires spend\nbetween two and five hours being onboarded for their new roles,\u201d says **Ronni\nZehavi, co-founder and CEO of Hibob** , in an exclusive chat with HR\nTechnologist.\n\nThis is the amount of time it takes to get the employee to sign their\ncompliance documents and for a general introduction to the rest of the team.\nHowever, the real onboarding begins once this process is over.\n\nA formal onboarding program can range between 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, or a\ngood 365 days. This phase is used to complete all the tasks mentioned in the\nprevious section through an environment of ongoing support.\n\nIdeally, onboarding begins \u2013 or should begin \u2013 as soon as the employee accepts\nthe offer letter.\n\n\u201cInvite new hires to join internal platforms ahead of their first week so that\nthey can not only get a head-start on reading the employee handbook and\npolicies, but also so they are able to put faces to names, learn about company\nnews, and get involved in social or cultural events at the company such as\nclubs that bring people together of shared interests \u2013 helping employees find\ntheir niche,\u201d recommends Zehavi.\n\n![The ideal duration of onboarding an employee](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 2. The ideal duration of onboarding an employee**\n\nThough it varies from organization to organization, the amount of time spent\non the various facets of onboarding can be broken down into these four phases:\n\n**1\\. One day to one week:** Ensure compliance, familiarize the employee with\ntheir role\n\n**2\\. One week to three months:** Train the employee to perform their job.\nFamiliarize them with their colleagues who are key to their function. Help\nthem get a sense of the culture of the organization.\n\n**3\\. Three months to six months:** Evaluate their performance and ensure that\nthey have everything they need to perform their jobs optimally. Take their\nfeedback to gauge their engagement.\n\n**4\\. Six months to a year:** The employee should have developed complete\nknowledge about their role, the market, the company, and the industry. They\nshould have assimilated into the company and company culture.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Using G-Suite for Employee\nOnboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/using-gsuite-for-employee-onboarding/)\n\n## **Employee Onboarding Process Template**\n\nTo deliver a meaningful [employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience/) starting right from\n**[recruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-recruitment/)** and onboarding, you must ensure that you\ndeliver a superior [onboarding\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/).

For managers, onboarding\nemployees is a longer process than it is for HR.**\n\n## **Chatbots: The Latest Employee Onboarding Heroes**\n\nThe priority for day one is to take an employee through all the necessary\npaperwork and inform them about the company\u2019s rules, policies, and background\nin general.\n\nBut a new employee is usually overwhelmed about being in a new place, and it\nis highly unlikely that they will be able to retain all the information you\u2019ve\nshared with them.\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen above, this is where a friendly chatbot can be most effective.\nIt is the chatbot whom your employees can turn to and ask questions without\nfeeling embarrassed about having forgotten or being unable to pay attention\nduring their orientation.\n\nSome of these questions are:\n\n  * \u201cHow many medical leaves am I entitled to?\u201d\n  * \u201cCan these leaves be carried over to the next year?\u201d\n  * \u201cHow often can I bring my daughter to work?\u201d\n\n  \nAn **[HR chatbot](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/expert-opinions-hr-chatbots/)** can be programmed to answer all\nthe questions your employees may have as and when they have them. And for\nquestions it cannot answer, it can be programmed to direct the employee to\nyou, the HR personnel, to answer those questions.\n\n_What does this do for the employee experience?_ **[Chatbots can redefine the\nemployee experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/3-ways-ai-chatbots-can-redefine-the-employee-experience/)** by\ncreating a comfortable environment for the employee to settle into.\n\n_What does this do for you?_ It saves you the time you spend answering\nrepetitive questions. You can share all the documents you want and all the\nlinks you want on company policies, but people belonging to the culture of\nGoogling the information they don't need to remember. They expect the same\nexperience in the workplace as well.\n\nIf you can cater to this expectation, both you and the employee will have a\nmore positive experience at work.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. **[Chatbots with friendly\npersonalities](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/how-to-define-your-recruitment-chatbots-personality/)** can be\ndesigned to query the new employee every so often.\n\n  * \u201cIt\u2019s been three days since you got here. How are you feeling?\u201d\n  * \u201cI notice you still haven\u2019t set up your self-service account. Would you like me to guide you through the process?\u201d\n\n  \nSuch conversations help employees feel cared for and included in the\norganization. It can also help them get acquainted with the workplace faster,\nmaking them efficient in a shorter amount of time.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **7 Benefits of Creating AI Help Desks for\nEmployees**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/7-benefits-of-creating-ai-help-desks-for-employees/)\n\n## **Best Practices for Employee Onboarding**\n\nA lot of employees are likely to drop out of a job even after accepting an\noffer. This is something you may not be able to control. But what you can\ncontrol is how the employee experience is defined once an employee enters your\norganization.\n\nWe notice that employee onboarding trends are changing now so that automation\nand upskilling are becoming the mainstay of the onboarding process, and there\nis a greater focus on the onboarding experience. While these were rare and\nfound in some companies, now even smaller companies will be compelled to pay\nattention to the onboarding experience and ensure that they can retain their\nemployees.\n\nThese trends are now becoming onboarding best practices. While some best\npractices are evergreen, others are trends evolving into best practices as we\nhead into the future of work. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n![The best practices that maximize the employee onboarding\nexperience](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 5. The best practices that maximize the employee onboarding experience**\n\n### **1\\. Ensure that the job matches the job description \u2013 and vice versa**\n\n  \nOften, employees are promised a certain role, but the breakdown of tasks in\nthe job reveals something entirely different from their expectations. In the\nHibob survey discussed above, more than 25% of employees shared that they were\nnot given enough information about their job before they accepted the offer.\nOn the other hand, 40% shared that their job was exactly what was described in\nthe interview.\n\nAddressing this problem requires a transparent recruitment process and a\ntransparent interview process as well. Bringing in talent based on job\ndescriptions candidates want to hear rather than what the job actually entails\ncan be the deal-breaker for employees.\n\nUsing an AI-powered writing tool such as Textio to write **[intelligent job\ndescriptions](file:///C:/Users/Puja/Documents/Articles/October%202019/Ramp%20up%20Your%20Recruitment%20With%20Intelligent%20Job%20Descriptions)**\ncan help you overcome this challenge.\n\n### **2\\. Automate and personalize the onboarding process**\n\n  \nWith technology changing the way we work, live, and interact, no one has the\npatience to fill in reams of manual documentation on paper. Instead, consider\ninstalling an onboarding software that will have basic information to be\nfilled in and the rest flowing in from other data sources. Configure the\nnecessary approval processes into the onboarding workflow so that the new\nemployee is intimated about the completion of formalities.\n\nMeasure and analyze how well you are implementing the process through custom\nalerts, dashboards, and reports. HR must build in the right compliances at the\noutset to be on track. From document verification to background checks to\nproject allocation and communications, you can streamline the entire process.\n\nMost software comes with automatic reminders, eliminating the cumbersome\ntracking of to-dos, and allowing you to focus on the strategic part of\nonboarding. Smart onboarding is a must for a great user experience.\n\n**[Automating employee\nonboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/4-reasons-to-automate-employee-onboarding)** can eliminate hours of\nadministrative work during employees\u2019 first week. Not only would this enable\nnew team members to hit the ground running right away, but it can also provide\na sense of belonging and an opportunity for them to learn more about the\ncompany, department and team members before day one.\n\nOnboarding software can also be used to help existing employees learn more\nabout their new team members. Imagine a new employee finding a coffee of their\nchoice from their favorite caf\u00e9 at their desk when they first arrive. This\nkind of personalization, made up of small but meaningful gestures, can change\nhow employees feel about the company in the long run.\n\nYou could even consider a **[video\nonboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/5-essentials-of-a-video-onboarding-strategy/)** strategy to get new\nemployees started off in their job as quickly and comfortably as possible.\n\n### **3\\. Action an end-to-end onboarding schedule and stick to it**\n\n  \nIf you want to make the **[onboarding process smarter and stress-\nfree](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/4-ways-\nto-make-onboarding-a-smarter-and-stressfree-process/)** , put the best\npractices into action by using the onboarding template provided above for all\nthat is scheduled to happen during the first week/first day of the employee\u2019s\narrival at the office premises. Share this chart with the new hire as well so\nthey know what to expect.\n\n### **4\\. Discuss everything that\u2019s necessary and skip what is not**\n\n  \nDepending on what the employee opts for (compensation components, benefits,\nwork arrangements, etc.), it is important to demarcate what is a must-do and\nwhat is optional under the onboarding program. This will depend on the role\nand function, and on what the manager wants to be covered.\n\nFor example, knowing about the company culture should be a mandate for every\nemployee, but induction on an insurance scheme may not be necessary for\nsomeone who has not opted for it.\n\n### **5\\. Provide complete company policy information**\n\n  \nOne reason why employees may be hard to retain is that they did not receive\nenough information about company policies when they were onboarded. Surprises\nin the form of pay cuts for leaving half an hour earlier than the end of the\nworkday, or not being informed about the leave policy clearly in advance can\nput them off. And so, employees leave the organization just about as soon as\nthey join it.\n\nA well-documented **[employee\nhandbook](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-self-\nservice/employee-handbook-dos-and-donts/)** that is shared with employees at\nthe outset is a great way to ensure that they have all the information they\nneed when they start their new jobs.\n\nThis can be delivered through your onboarding platform or even simply through\nthe company intranet. It is a great idea to power your chatbot to answer such\nqueries as well, because not every employee may be able to mentally retain all\nthe policies outlined in the handbook.\n\n### **6\\. Provide all the tools they need to do their job**\n\n  \nThis entails clearing up the space assigned to the employee, organizing access\ncards, employee IDs, and helping set up the IT equipment. Also, ensure all\ntheir communication and employee self-service accounts are created before they\narrive on the job.  \n\n### **7\\. Conduct a meet and greet**\n\n  \nIt is important to make the new employee feel welcomed as a part of the\nimmediate and extended team. Make sure to have a ready list of staff they\nshould meet in the first few days and block their time to make the meetings\nhappen.\n\nFor specific roles, it is important to facilitate a chat with leadership. The\nfact that senior leaders are taking out time to learn about them makes people\nfeel valued.\n\nA great way to do this, if you have geographical challenges, is by having a\nvideo CEO interaction. Other small aspects to keep in mind are inviting new\nemployees or team members to lunch and informing them about the dos and don\u2019ts\nof the company. The objective is to extend a warm welcome to the employee so\nthey feel comfortable enough to integrate right from day one.\n\n### **8\\. Avoid an isolating onboarding experience**\n\n  \nAnother key point Zehavi mentions is that \u201cnew hires commonly report negative\nonboarding experiences when they are singled out as a new hire rather than\nbeing onboarded in a group, as this can create added stress.\u201d\n\nIt is overwhelming to be the new face in the organization. But a positive\ncompany culture and a new-hire buddy can help change this. The support offered\nby a designated mentor/colleague can ease the stress of being in a new\nenvironment. And, as already established, chatbot support can be a game-\nchanger in the employee onboarding experience.\n\n### **9\\. Measure onboarding metrics**\n\n  \nA smart onboarding system will typically throw up a slew of relevant\n**[onboarding metrics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-five-onboarding-metrics/)** to help track the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the onboarding process. Some of the key metrics to track are\ncosts, engagement levels, training costs, and outcomes for new employees,\nsuccession management success rates, and retention.\n\nSome HR departments go one step ahead to calculate the overall onboarding ROI\nby tying it into performance, development costs, [attrition\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nattrition-complete-guide/)statistics, and talent management initiatives.\n\nAll this put together will help you keep the onboarding process efficient as\nyou hire more talent in a tight talent market.\n\n## **Beyond Onboarding: Crossboarding and Offboarding**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, crossboarding entails using existing employees for a new\nrole in the company instead of hiring external talent. By training, upskilling\nor reskilling the employee, the organization empowers them to take on the new\nrole. These employees must be onboarded too, being given information about\ntheir new reporting structure, the new skill set they will need on the job,\nand the new key performance indicators, and handling this transfer into new\nroles also fall under HR\u2019s job description.\n\n### **Crossboarding**\n\n  \nApart from following the best practices mentioned above, here are three ways\nto go about crossboarding an employee efficiently:\n\n**1\\. Identify cost gaps and plug them with the right talent**\n\nSmart HR managers will always have their eyes on recruitment costs and look an\nalternative vacancy filling mechanism, where an existing employee with the\nright talent and fit is made to shift into a newer and expanded role. This\nempowers the employee while minimizing investments and creating a sense of\nbelonging and ownership.\n\n**2\\. Communicate your expectations clearly**\n\nOften, an employee may feel underwhelmed by the change of role. It is\nimportant to make them feel that it isn\u2019t a step down \u2013 instead, it is a way\nto pick up new skills. This is vital to actually invest themselves in the\nextended role and really deliver.\n\n**3\\. Use your social network**\n\nGreat HR managers always have their ears to the ground. They pick up current\ntrends, gather data on work frustration, and quickly shift good workers to new\nroles before they begin to look outward. Relationship-building is at the\ncornerstone of every HR team\u2019s toolbox.\n\n### **Offboarding**\n\n  \nSometimes, organizations can be a little cold when letting go of an employee.\nThis can create a sense of disappointment and resentment in employees and\nclose off future possibilities of rehiring them. Here are three ways to avoid\nthis:\n\n**1\\. Make memories**\n\nNo matter the reasons driving the departure, it is important to say goodbye\nwith warmth and a degree of affability that doesn\u2019t take away from the first\nimpressions of an onboarding program. Celebrate what the employee achieved,\norganize a farewell, and talk positively about the employee. Someday, this\ncould engineer a turnaround.\n\n**2\\. Gather feedback**\n\nTry to understand what led to the employee\u2019s exit. Did they experience a job-\nrelated issue that could not be resolved? Did they have trouble assimilating\ninto the company culture? A detailed offboarding documentation process is as\nimportant onboarding and can help contain future attrition challenges.\n\n**3\\. Enable compliance**\n\nIt is critical to ensure all security protocols and regulatory considerations\nare well-maintained even as employees leave the company months (or years)\nafter their onboarding program. A detailed exit management template, timeline,\nand checklist will make this process foolproof and error-free.\n\n## **The Onboarding Experience and Employee Engagement and Retention Are\nClosely Related**\n\nZehavi mentions, \u201cOur data shows that new hires dread adapting to office\npolitics and personalities more than learning new protocol or filling out\npaperwork. If you find that your office is cliquey in nature, your new hires\nwill notice. An office environment that lacks a sense of inclusivity and\ncommunity can be extremely off-putting and intimidating for employees who are\njust joining the organization.\u201d\n\n_So, can HR change this_? Not alone, says Zehavi. \u201cIn traditional office\nsettings, HR teams do not work as closely with employees as team managers, so\nit can be difficult for HR to effect change. It is imperative to include\nculture training for managers, so they are able to create the most inclusive\nenvironment possible for new team members.\u201d\n\nFormal employee onboarding programs are more likely to drive success because\nof their structured nature. They help employees familiarize themselves with\nthe organization, its people, and its culture through a series of planned\nsequential tasks.\n\nWhile it may be challenging for employees to remember everything at once, it\nis far better than the \u201csink or swim\u201d approach, where they have to figure out\nwhat the best way to go about a certain task in the workplace is.\n\nYou cannot foresee or avoid some cases of **[employee\nturnover](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/key-ways-to-reduce-\nyour-employee-turnover-rate/)** , but turnover that arises from poor\n**[employee engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-engagement/)** can be controlled. Needless to say,\nthis is by arranging for a positive employee onboarding experience from day\none. Just like first impressions matter when you meet people, they matter when\nemployees first interact with the organization as its members.\n\nWhether you onboard employees individually or in groups, it is important to\ndeliver a consistent experience to them. This can be achieved to a certain\nextent when you automate key tasks \u2013 and deliver a **[digital employee\nonboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/the-importance-of-digital-employee-onboarding-and-how-to-\nachieve-it-in-a-digital-workplace/)** experience \u2013 such as delivering employee\ncompliance documents beforehand, breaking down their tasks for them, and\ngiving them insights into the teams they will be a part of.\n\nIn addition, deploy regular onboarding surveys in the first 15, 30, 60, and 90\ndays. This serves two purposes. One, it helps you create a consistent\nonboarding program for all new hires. Two, it helps you learn how your new\nemployees are doing \u2013 whether they need any help or if they have any specific\nfeedback for you. These surveys can be delivered through a chatbot so that\nemployees can take the survey at their convenience.\n\n**Learn More:[10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020\nHires](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/)**\n\n## **The Changing Face of Employee Onboarding**\n\nAs we head into the future of work, onboarding will begin to involve more than\njust compliance and integration into the work culture. In an exclusive\nconversation with HR Technologist, Robert Dvorak, CEO of SilkRoad Technology,\na provider of **[strategic\nonboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/strategic-onboarding-plan-2019/)** and workforce provider\nsolutions, said that onboarding is not just for new hires. It extends to the\nentire workforce.\n\nStressing the importance of continuous learning, he said, \u201cHR leaders must\nprepare their entire workforce \u2013 not just new hires \u2013 with the skills they\nneed, and _continually \u2018onboard\u2019_ them to new roles of business value and\nrelevance. These new skills include critical thinking, active learning, and an\nagile mindset to build sustained relevancy to their organization and their\ncareer\u201d [emphasis added].\n\nSo in the employee onboarding process, while it is essential to ensure that\nyour employees are happy with the culture they are being brought into, it is\nalso essential to engage in continuous onboarding to help them stay relevant\nin their jobs. A positive and **[technology-enabled onboarding\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/why-a-\nsmooth-technologyenabled-onboarding-process-is-critical-now-more-than-ever/)**\nwill result in higher engagement and high performance and productivity on the\njob \u2013 much faster.\n\n_What is your understanding of the employee onboarding process?

and\nworkers around the world.\n\nBut as companies focus on sustaining their businesses during these challenging\ntimes, employees\u2019 health and safety have been at the top of employers\u2019\npriorities as well.\n\nAnd with the outbreak showing little signs of slowing, many companies are\ntaking no chances by implementing measures such as working from home,\nstaggered work hours and even social distancing, to ensure their employees\u2019\nhealth and prevent an outbreak in their workplaces.\n\nEmployees find themselves being thrown into the deep end of adapting to remote\nworking and adopting technology such as work collaboration platforms like\nMicrosoft Teams, Zoom and Slack to ensure productivity and communication.\n\nHRM Asia spoke exclusively to different employers to find out what are some of\nthe measures and technologies they have implemented during the COVID-19\noutbreak.\n\n**Cisco**\n\n**Measures:**\n\n  * The company has made mandatory global work-from-home policies, including in Singapore and across APAC.\n  * It has limited, postponed and suspended travel and gatherings and its global events.\n  * For key meetings and events, it is making them virtual so many more can participate.\n  * Employees are encouraged to take advantage of Cisco\u2019s mental health offerings and maintain open communication with managers. Ensuring the wellbeing of employees and their families remains its top priority.\n  * It also organises weekly Global Calls with all employees on topics such as mental health, as well as medical advice and Cisco\u2019s response to the pandemic.\n\n**Technologies** :\n\n  * In-house Cisco Webex technology that helps employees stay connected and productive, while also staying healthy\n\n\u201cAt Cisco, our employees are the highest priority, and their safety and well-\nbeing are paramount. As we navigate this challenging new reality, we stand\nbehind all of our people and their families,\u201d said Deborah Woollard, Vice\nPresident, People and Cultures, APJC.\n\n\u201cWorking remotely is a natural part of our work culture and has been ingrained\nin our work DNA for years. We are fortunate to build the amazing Cisco Webex\ntechnology that helps all of us stay connected and productive, while also\nstaying healthy.\n\n\"Across Asia and globally, a mandatory work from home policy is in place to\nprotect our employees and in line with local regulations. The pandemic is\nimpacting lives in countless ways and we are offering the best available\nmedical and mental health support, emergency time off, and a commitment to\nfull pay for our hourly workers,\" she added.\n\n**HP**\n\n**Measures:**\n\n  * Social distancing and work-from-home arrangements: It has deployed a large-scale work from home policy in Singapore and across Asia to ensure the safety of employees, and is empowering teams with the tools and the flexibility they need to execute and stay connected.\n  * Enhanced safety protocols: Rigorous cleaning and access procedures are in place for offices, labs and manufacturing facilities that remain open. For on-site services, the company has defined operating health and safety protocols to ensure that technicians are healthy and remain healthy on visits.\n  * HP has rolled out an employees\u2019 guide outlining best practices for working from home. This includes guidelines around setting up an optimal work from home experience, using collaborative platforms, and a quick-and-easy guide to maintaining the safety and cleanliness of electronic devices for maintaining a healthy work environment.\n  * It will also be offering additional programs to assist employees, focusing on wellbeing, working in a mobile environment and stress management.\n  * For employees who are parents, school closures and reduced after-school activities mean their children will be spending more time at home and having to leverage technology to ensure their education is not disrupted. The company is encouraging them to take this opportunity to play a more active role in steering their children\u2019s learning, including by creating online resources such as Print & Play that has fun learning activities for children.\n\n**Technologies:**\n\n  * Teams are mobile-ready and have the flexibility to be productive wherever they are working. They are encouraged to work remotely and further optimise their experience with the tools they need, from notebook PCs and peripherals to collaborative software.\n\n\u201cAcross the world people are confronting new challenges and adjusting to new\nrealities. The way we respond to the situation will have a profound impact on\nmodern life \u2013 economically, politically and culturally. Technology is taking\nelevated role in our day to day lives and is essential in keeping us connected\nand helping us support one another. Used purposefully, technology is a vital\nenabler to help us all to stay connected, keep learning, keep working and keep\ngoing.\" said Ng Tian Chong, Senior Vice President & Managing Director, Greater\nAsia, HP Inc.\n\n**AXA**\n\n**Measures:**\n\n  * AXA ramped up its capacity to ensure critical service staff in the affected regions could work from home and moved operations online. Even amidst the disruption caused by the outbreak, the company is able to maintain continuity of service. For example, AXA Tian Ping in China was able to go from 0% work-from home amongst Telephone Service Representatives (TSRs) to over 80% working from home.\n  * AXA has provided protective masks, health checks and upgraded the team's insurance coverage. To avoid the possibility of contamination in the office, they implemented an effective rota system.\n  * A professional counselling service is provided to help staff handle this situation and a hotline is available around the clock to offer consultations on a strictly confidential basis.\n\n**Technologies:**\n\n  * Its IT team helped carry out a company-wide digital transformation. This enabled employees to access to work from home capabilities, including claims and telephone service representatives.\n  * Its offices around the region are using various methods to engage their teams, such as video conferencing, virtual town hall meetings hosted by senior management and regular updates through internal channels. These help to ensure staff continue to feel connected to the business and each other.\n\n**Lenovo**\n\n**Measures:**\n\n  * In Singapore, Lenovo implemented flexible working arrangements several weeks before and encourages employees to work from home.\n  * The company also put in place measures to encourage employees to practice personal hygiene, including washing of hands, regular temperature checks, and favouring online video conferencing tools wherever possible.\n\n**Technologies:**\n\n  * It is enabling employee productivity and collaboration through tools such as telecommunication tools and software applications to remain connected. And accessories such as noise cancellation headset w/ microphone to keep employees engaged and focused as well as a second monitor to enable efficient multi-tasking.\n  * Lenovo also offers refresher courses to employees to ensure that they leverage the supporting tools and applications efficiently. Clear and open communication is vital when many employees need to work from home to make sure the team feel connected and happy.\n  * Lenovo leverages on collaboration and videoconferencing tools to regularly touch base with employees to check in on their well-being while continue with our day-to-day business activities as far as possible.\n  * Employees have easy access to quality devices and equipment fitted with collaboration software platforms, which enables them to be easily connected in remote arrangements. As employees continue to work from home, it is important to foster engagement to maintain business operations and foster a positive employee experience.\n\n\u201cLenovo employees\u2019 health and safety is our top priority. We have worked with\nour benefits vendor to introduce tele-medicine and virtual consultation as\nadded services to our employees since February. While we encourage all\nemployees to work from home, we undertake all health advisory measures by MOM\nto ensure that our office premise is safe for employees who need to continue\nworking at the office,\u201d said Ronnie Lee, General Manager, Lenovo Singapore.\n\n**Blackberry**\n\n**Measures** :\n\n  * The company has been following the guidance shared by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO) and major governments, and have our business continuity plans in place to ensure critical business operations continue without interruption.\n  * Since the start of this pandemic, it has implemented remote work / work from home policies for its global workforce and placed a hold on all non-essential international and domestic travel (including all events and conferences).\n  * All corporate events are now virtual, and employees are using alternative and virtual ways of conducting internal and external meetings, and trainings, to enable everyone to participate and engage while following social distancing guidelines. In addition, the company also offers health and wellness training and tips to its global workforce.\n\n**Technologies:**\n\n  * Employees actively use its own secure connectivity technology such as BlackBerry Spark (Unified Endpoint Management and Unified End-Point Security) and BlackBerry Desktop to establish seamless and robust remote working environments for secure collaboration, encryption and file sharing on-the-go.\n  * The company also uses its own artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions to detect and prevent cyber threats to end-points and provide seamless, intelligent security (such as secure VPN-less access) at home.\n  * It uses its own secure, networked crisis communications software, BlackBerry AtHoc, to alert and receive updates from staff.\n  * Blackberry has made some of its solutions \u2013 including some of those mentioned above \u2013 available free of charge for 60 days with onboarding support to help companies work remotely, maintain operations and stay safe.\n\n\"The mobile workforce has been an upward trend for a long time. Globally, it\nwas already becoming common to take your office with you, wherever you go.\nCOVID-19 has merely accelerated it for millions of organizations globally,\"\nsaid Stephen Mak, Vice President, BlackBerry Spark, Asia and Japan,\nBlackBerry.\n\n\"Benefits aside, remote working also exposes businesses to increased risk.\nAlready we have seen widespread reports of COVID-19 related phishing and\nmalware campaigns that impersonate government, authorities and businesses,\ntargeting both individuals and organizations. This will only increase the\nlonger we face this pandemic, as organizations, data and people remain\nvulnerable to those that exploit the situation.\n\n\"The key point is, securing apps, devices, and firewalls alone is no longer\nenough. Establishing highly functional and secure remote working\ninfrastructures has now become an absolute imperative for businesses to\nmaintain continuity while keeping staff safe remotely,\" he added.\n\n**Schroders**\n\n**Measures** :\n\n  * All offices across its 35 locations globally are fully operational, with most of the employees working remotely, in line with local government advice. It is continuing to closely monitor developments and follow the advice of government agencies\n  * The company already has robust contingency plans in place, including business continuity measures to maintain the resilience of its business, and protect the health and safety of its staff, clients, and guests.\n  * Employees are fully equipped with secure access to its systems, keeping in regular contact with clients and colleagues, while working flexibly to meet business and family needs. It is able to switch to this working model swiftly and seamlessly because of its agile work culture and early investment in reliable and versatile technology that allows the company to do so.\n\n**Technologies:**\n\n  * It rolled out an integrated virtual platform years ago that allows staff to work anywhere from any location at any time using just one log-in. They get full access to the systems they would usually get in the office. For instance, with its virtual desktops, portfolio managers, analysts and traders get exactly the same experience at home or in the office.\n  * Collaboration tools, messaging and chat applications help the traders stay coordinated with fund managers and operations, while Bloomberg IB Chat and Symphony also allow secure messaging with brokers and counterparties.\n  * When employees are working from home for extended periods, managers are encouraged to set a stage for everyone to communicate openly, such as organising virtual 15-minute morning team huddles, and foster an inclusive environment by encouraging team members to continue to share their opinions via video or phone calls.\n\n\u201cThis is not just flexible working. It is about the deepening relationships\nwith employees and putting trust in them at all times. Empowering employees\nthrough constantly evolving technology is what makes this possible,\u201d said\nNancy Lee, Head of Human Resources, Asia Pacific, Schroders.\n\n**Fave Singapore**\n\n**Measures:**\n\n  * Its employees have been operating on a Team A/Team B staggered model, allowing for social distancing in its offices.\n  * Productivity and morale are something that the company is constantly monitoring on a daily level. And it encourages its leaders to have daily check-ins with their teams and individuals on video calls, carry out all regular team rituals such as team lunches, and happy hours over a call. This ensures that employees get the right workspace set up at home as suddenly our homes turned into an office space.\n  * While homes can be set up for productivity, the company believes that it should not become a 24-hour office. The company is ensuring that its employees finds the balance and have time to reconnect with families and loved ones.\n\n**Technologies:**\n\n  * To ensure constant communication between the teams, employees make full use of online communication platforms such as Zoom, Google Hangouts and WhatsApp to communicate.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 situation has meant that as a company, we\u2019ve had to adapt,\ninnovate and improve in the way we communicate and collaborate with each\nother,\u201d said Ng Aik-Phong, Managing Director, Fave Singapore.\n\n**Criteo**\n\n**Measures:**\n\n  * Criteo promptly executed its Business Continuity Plan \u2013 securing data centres, client support and internal processes so it can continue serving its clients without interruption.\n  * Its People Experience team was immediately activated to facilitate a seamless transition to remote working.\n  * Up to date, its 2,800 employees from 30 offices around the globe were asked to work from home as a voluntary measure and it has cancelled all business travel.\n  * To help employees handle both work and care-giving duties at the same time, it has intentionally put flexible working hours in place to provide assurance and relief to affected employees. This was especially helpful for teams in Japan and Korea, where work and leisure hours are more clearly defined.\n  * Communication with employees became more critical especially without in-person interaction. The company share weekly updates on COVID-19 status, health insurance policies and FAQs to local government measures with employees. This is so they are highly aware of the situation at hand in case they are in need of help.\n  * The company also offered psychological support hotlines for employees who are faced with challenges coping with the current state of work\n\n**Technologies:**\n\n  * Leaders could enrol in virtual training sessions to better manage their teams virtually.\n  * Team members could also attend virtual trainings to enhance their skills to better serve clients.\n  * The company continued to hold regional and local team lunches and drinks virtually to engage and have \u201cface-to-face\u201d interaction. Its Japan team recently celebrated Hanami, or cherry blossom season, over a video conference. This was well-received and initiatives like these bring fun into the daily work.\n\n**Weber Shandwick**\n\n**Measures:**\n\n  * To minimize crowded commutes, dense workspaces, and potential exposure, employees across its markets globally, have been encouraged to work from home.\n  * Its Singapore office began with a mandatory work from home trial in early February, followed by full implementation of the Ministries of Health and Manpower guidelines for daily temperature and travel tracking.\n  * The company took a carefully orchestrated split team approach for four weeks in line with our business continuity plan. This included a complete separation of both teams at work and off-hours, video calls replacing meetings and limiting external parties in our office.\n  * As the number of cases increased in Singapore and globally, the management quickly decided that to reduce risk and keep everyone and their families safe, it would implement a full work from home plan in mid-March.\n  * An Employee Assistance Program is also available to all employees and their family members for any emotional and practical support. The company has also been utilising the Employee Assistance Program to host well-being seminars.\n  * Its HR team continues to share work from home tips and tricks and stays connected with individuals via regular email\n  * It continues to engage employees through its We Stand Together initiative where colleagues from around the region host a live workout video, training session (photography/visualisation) or yoga session to foster an ongoing sense of community and connection.\n\n**Technologies:**\n\n  * Microsoft Teams has been a part of its collaboration ecosystem globally\u2014during this period. The company has made this platform central to how it works across the office for calls, messaging, sharing documents, working together so that people are not spreading themselves to thin trying to keep up with multiple platforms.\n\n\"Despite these unique circumstances, I see our team doing their best, staying\ncommitted, and going the extra mile for clients and each other, even when\nworking from home. With each of us setting aside some conveniences to play a\npart in minimising community spread, we are doing our part to make a\ndifference to the virus trajectory in Singapore, as we are in every market we\noperate in,\" said Vanessa Ho, managing director, Singapore and chair, client\nservices, Asia Pacific, Weber Shandwick.\n\n**Honeywell Aerospace**\n\n**Measures:**\n\n  * As the COVID-19 coronavirus situation continues to evolve, the company is taking a number of precautions, including complying with local and national guidelines, travel restrictions, enhanced site cleaning and holding virtual employee and customer meetings.

Sibson Consulting is a leading human\ncapital consulting firm in the U.S.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nAt a recent meeting with a long-standing client that has a strong company\nculture, the CHRO asked my opinion on how to solve a growing issue. The\nretention rate among new hires was going down, and the CEO was asking for both\nan analysis and a plan to stop the slide. The realization was that something\nneeded to change, because the amount of recruitment and retraining was driving\nunneeded expenses.\n\nRecruiting and onboarding practices were never topics that were addressed in\nour work together or in our status meetings \u2014 primarily because the overall\nretention numbers for the organization were impressive. Pulling back the\ncurtain, it became clear that there were marked differences between longer-\nterm employees and new hires, and between the later millennials through baby\nboomers and those very early in their careers. To put it succinctly, what\nworked in the past might need significant revisions.\n\n**The Action Plan**\n\nThe CHRO agreed to a multi-phased approach:\n\n1\\. Conduct an audit of the current onboarding program.\n\n2\\. Compare the current program to known best practices and emerging industry\ntrends.\n\n3\\. Assess applicability of cutting-edge onboarding measures (what I will call\nhere onboarding 2.0), designed for specific demographic groups but applicable\nacross the workforce.\n\nThe first phase was relatively easy because human resources managed the\ncurrent program. But that immediately pointed to a deficiency: The onboarding\nprogram was HR-centric rather than representing a true, aligned partnership\namong senior management, HR and the hiring managers. The current program felt\nmore like set events in a limited process instead of a three- to six-month\nprocess concentrating on mission, values and experience.\n\nKnowing that the organization had a strong culture, which is a factor in\nretention but which can carry with it some good and bad elements, we began to\nstress test the culture to determine what may have changed or to identify\naspects of the legacy culture that were getting in the way.  Our team\nrecommended anonymous interviews as well as focus groups with a cross section\nof staff representing a mixture of tenures, generations and genders in an\neffort to better map the existing culture.\n\n**Phase 1 Results**\n\nThe analysis of the interviews helped define what was taking place: Millennial\nnew hires were the least likely to feel connected to the organization\u2019s\nculture and, in some aspects, the mission. We also found pockets of gender and\ntenure issues. Specific comments further emphasized that senior management\u2019s\ninternal employee messages were not resonating with new hires as the messages\ncontinued to lean toward a culture that was somewhat stale and not inspiring\nfor new recruits. These messages were disconnected from the messages heard\nduring the recruitment process.\n\nWe learned that a clear breakdown was occurring early on, where hiring\nmanagers were not investing enough time and effort in bringing new hires up to\nspeed and communicating their importance to the team. Even when dialogue was\ntaking place, a gap remained between new hires and their managers in what new\nhires were hearing during recruitment and what was transpiring over the first\n120 days of employment.\n\n**Phase 2 Improvements**\n\nWe also compared the current onboarding program to a set of objective best\npractices we had identified. In working with the organization\u2019s HR team, we\nfound that many of the best practices were already in place, but they had room\nfor improvement in their design and consistency of application. These\nincluded:\n\n\u2022 Forming a true cross-departmental onboarding team with a year-round and\nongoing charter.\n\n\u2022 Ensuring job descriptions matched the positions accurately.\n\n\u2022 Reaching out to new hires _before_ their start dates to engage them in\norganization history, successes, mission and values.\n\nOur analysis was shared with the CHRO and subsequently presented to the CEO\nwith the following recommendations:\n\n\u2022 Improve CEO messaging to broaden the audience and create specific new-hire\ncommunications that emphasized the organization\u2019s mission and aligned the\nopportunities for impact by the employees.\n\n\u2022 Update and extend the new-hire onboarding program including messaging and\napproach, and train hiring managers immediately to follow the program and\nalign with leadership messages, themes and, especially, opportunities for\nimpact.\n\n\u2022 Create a timeline for adding select best practices identified as missing to\nthe organization\u2019s program.\n\n\u2022 Add onboarding and retention metrics to hiring managers\u2019 goals and\nperformance measures, and articulate the career framework to the hiring\nmanagers as one not driven exclusively by HR, but as an organizational\npriority.\n\nThe CEO and CHRO understood that the changes necessary would take months to\nimplement, and that the cultural shift would take that much longer. So\nmilestones were developed and shared with the entire organization, and they\nwere linked to hiring practices and the new onboarding platform as it\ndeveloped. The organization also committed to ongoing monitoring through\nemployee surveys and focus groups over the coming years to identify necessary\ntweaks and to help determine if the cultural shift and new onboarding\nexperience were helping to improve the retention issue with new hires.\n\nIn order to manage the changes with the resources available \u2014 in essence, to\nnot bite off more than they could chew \u2014 consideration of onboarding 2.0\npractices would be postponed to the first annual review of the revised\nprogram.\n\nIn an upcoming Part 2, we'll explore highlights of the first-year analysis and\nunderstand what is coming into focus as onboarding 2.0 evolves.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Dan Fries](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2018/07/danfries1_avatar_1531763911-400x400.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/danfries1/\n\"Photo of Dan Fries\")\n\n[Dan\nFries](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/danfries1/)\n\nDan Fries is an SVP and the Managing Director of [Sibson\nConsulting](http://www.sibson.com).

A\nnew [survey](http://bit.ly/2FieFCm) of more than 200 human resources\nprofessionals suggests the same processes for onboarding newcomers are not\nused nearly enough to help prepare existing workers for advancement within\ncompanies.\n\nCommissioned by SilkRoad Technology and conducted by The Harris Poll between\nMarch and April 2019, the online poll surveyed 203 HR \"decision-makers\" about\nhow their companies handle onboarding. Researchers found that most companies\ntoday fail to ensure their employees' competency after the initial onboarding\ntraining.\n\n\"These results paint a picture of a corporate environment that is not\nutilizing the full potential of its greatest assets \u2013 its people \u2013 through\nonboarding, learning, and performance programs for employee development and\ntraining,\" said Robert Dvorak, president and CEO of SilkRoad Technology.\n\nWhile the survey found that 91% of respondents felt onboarding was an\noverwhelmingly positive thing that benefits employees and \"could drive culture\nchange and business innovation,\" there were other takeaways as well.\n\n## Employee onboarding disparity exists between new hires and current workers\n\nAccording to researchers, 90% of the HR professionals polled said their\nonboarding programs include efforts that help new hires, but 94% said they\nbelieved the process should continue to help existing employees better\nunderstand their roles. Despite those vast agreements, 77% admit that their\ncompany's onboarding efforts focus almost exclusively on new hires.\n\nAdditionally, roughly 68% of respondents said their company's onboarding\nefforts were treated as a \"static event\" rather than a continuous process. Of\nthose polled, only 11% said they had onboarding efforts that never ended,\nthough 65% said they felt the process worked well for helping existing\nemployees.\n\nLilith Christiansen, vice president of onboarding solutions at SilkRoad\nTechnology, said those findings highlight a commonly missed opportunity.\n\"Companies have tremendous opportunities to ... strengthen the bonds they have\nwith their employees through strategic onboarding that's continuous,\nintentional and employee-centric,\" she said. \"Many companies see onboarding as\na finite process with a beginning and end. Done properly, onboarding never\nends. It supports employees through their entire lifecycles with the company.\"\n\n## Emergent tech will change employee onboarding goals\n\nAs emergent technologies like artificial intelligence and automation disrupt\nthe way companies hire and onboard employees, the HR professionals polled said\ntheir companies were ready to meet the changes. However, when asked if those\nsame technologies were ready to help assess current employees, respondents\nwere not as confident.\n\nThe main issue behind that lack of confidence, according to Dvorak, is that\ncompanies don't measure the efficacy of their onboarding and employee\ndevelopment programs against how they mesh with the company's operational and\nfinancial goals.\n\n\"During the next three to five years, businesses in every industry are\nexpected to experience massive disruption and opportunity through automated,\ndigital, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning advances,\" Dvorak\nsaid. \"Companies must adopt strategies to monitor these changes, prepare their\nentire workforce \u2013 not just new hires \u2013 with the skills they need, and\ncontinually 'onboard' them to new roles of business value and relevance.\"\n\nWith the coming technological changes in mind, 83% of respondents said they\nwere confident their company was \"extremely prepared\" or \"somewhat prepared\"\nto handle AI and automation in the workplace. However, just 37% of that group\nsaid their employee onboarding software was prepared to teach workers skills,\nand only 36% said they were ready to address overall company success.\nSimilarly, 36% of respondents said their onboarding software was ready to help\nensure employees worked well together, and 33% said it was ready to help\ntransition employees to new roles.\n\n## Companies face employee onboarding challenges and changes\n\nWhile nearly every HR professional polled agreed that onboarding has a\npositive effect on a company, they told researchers they didn't believe most\ncompanies will focus on it in the future. Approximately 35% of respondents\nsaid \"understanding and addressing onboarding issues\" was a high priority at\ntheir company, while 45% said it was a medium priority and 20% said it was a\nlow priority or not a priority at all.\n\nJust 28% said they anticipated their company's focus on onboarding to increase\nover the next five years. Only 19% said they expected their company to do\nnothing to change its onboarding strategy.\n\nTo better adapt onboarding to a rapidly changing workforce, HR professionals\nhave to be able to measure the outcome. According to the survey, approximately\ntwo-thirds of respondents said they usually measure things like employee\nretention (70%) and employee engagement (66%) as key performance indicators\n(KPIs). Fewer gauge revenue performance (30%), cost reduction (29%), customer\nretention (23%) and increased market share (21%) as KPIs.\n\nWith that in mind, 33% of respondents said measuring their onboarding program\nagainst the right KPIs is one of the \"top three biggest onboarding challenges\"\nthey face. Personalizing the new hire onboarding experience (31%), improving\nnew hire engagement (30%) and quickly implementing changes (29%) were the\nother top priorities.\n\nChristiansen said the survey results \"show companies have much work to do \u2013\nthat the C-suite needs to pay closer attention to the issues surrounding\nonboarding and development and recognize the business impact of doing so.\"\n\n![](https://img.business.com/w/80/aHR0cHM6Ly9zZWN1cmUuZ3JhdmF0YXIuY29tL2F2YXRhci84ODJmYzhjY2Y4Zjc2YzFlYzVlYWJmNTg5MGI3MjU5Yj9zPTQwMCZkPW1t)\n\nAndrew Martins\n\n    \n\nAndrew Martins is an award-winning journalist with a Bachelor of Arts in\njournalism from Ramapo College of New Jersey.

added more than 50,000\nfreshers last year.\n\n  * ## ALSO READ\n\n## [International offers, packages to go up as IITs begin placements

college campuses by information\ntechnology (IT) services [companies ](/companies)is likely to be delayed owing\nto uncertainties arising out of global spread of [coronavirus ](/about/what-\nis-coronavirus)(Covid-19). IT firms are expected to absorb these freshers in a\nstaggered manner. Sources in the know said the chances of dishonouring joining\nletters seem remote at this point in time.\n\nSince most IT firms anticipate a demand slowdown in the coming quarters,\nhiring from tier-III and IV [engineering colleges ](/topic/engineering-\ncolleges)through walk-in interviews is going take a massive hit in 2020, said\nindustry experts.\n\n\"Freshers, slated to join in May-June, are likely to be scheduled for\nonboarding in August-September. Some IT firms are likely to defer their\njoining, based on the developments in the US, the UK, and Continental Europe,\"\nsaid Aditya Narayan Mishra, director & chief executive officer at CIEL HR\nServices. In a worst-case scenario, only 5 per cent of offer letters may not\nbe honoured, he said.\n\nAnticipating demand, the top four IT firms of India added more than 50,000\nfreshers last year. Hiring of fresh graduates is also part of the initiative\nof most IT firms to rightsize their employee pyramid, which has become mid-\nlevel heavy in recent years.\n\nAmong IT firms, market leader Tata Consultancy Services has added around\n30,000 fresh graduates in the last financial year. The company's management\nhas said it is going to increase this number to 39,000 in the current\nfinancial year (2020-21). Similarly, Infosys has made 18,000 offers last\nfinancial year, while Wipro has said it will onboard around 20,000 fresh\ngraduates in 2019-20.\n\nSince 55-60 per cent of the operating cost of Indian IT services players\ncomprises wages, hiring of college graduates keeps cost in control, apart from\ninfusing young blood into an organisation.  \n  \n\n![chart](https://bsmedia.business-\nstandard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2020-04/06/full/1586187179-594.jpg)\n\n\"IT firms have rolled out offers to fresh graduates factoring in a bullish\ndemand environment, which has changed after the Covid-19 crisis. But\ndishonouring offer letters has certain reputational risks attached to it.\nAlso, all tier-I [companies ](/companies)and mid-tier firms have the strength\nof balance sheet to absorb new hires,\" said Pareekh Jain, an IT outsourcing\nadvisor and founder of Pareekh Consulting.\n\nLate last week, IIT-Delhi's Director V Ramgopal Rao had appealed to all\nrecruiters to not withdraw the job offers made to students. \"Once a student is\noffered placement, according to the IIT-Delhi policy, the student is not\nallowed to sit for other placements. Students trust the [companies\n](/companies)with their offers and don't apply to other companies,\" he had\ntweeted.\n\nThe IT industry is staring at a demand slowdown, with many developed\ncountries, including the US, starting to shut down establishments for imposing\nsocial distancing to fight the spread of the contagion. As a result, IT firms\nhave already witnessed delay in winning large deals, with reports suggesting\naround $3-4 billion worth deal signings deferred in March.\n\n**[ **Read our full coverage on

This can range from a complete\nreinvention of identity and purpose to just a slight shift that includes the\nnew partner: its history, narrative and critical traits.\n\nWhen this cultural identity shift is not even considered, the original DNA is\nso strong that it risks pushing out the acquired partner and setting the\nacquisition up for failure. Assets might not be operated at their optimum,\ncustomers don\u2019t feel heard and critical top talent might walk out the door,\ntaking their market and technical knowledge base, and their client\nrelationships with them.\n\nCompanies with a strong DNA typically demonstrate the following common traits:\n\n  * Even when it\u2019s far back in history, the founder has a name and a face that is familiar to all employees. The originating story is well-known and the current core values are still connected to some of the founding principles\n  * There is a \u2013 often well-intended \u2013 sense of superiority. Their own culture, processes and leadership style are seen as best in class. It is what makes them successful\n  * Leaders have grown up in the company. They have demonstrated that they carry the same DNA, breath the core values and understand the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to successfully navigate in the company\n  * With that might come a certain company blindness. \u2018The way we do things here\u2019 is not challenged enough. New hires are immediately absorbed by the well-oiled onboarding process and operational rhythm\n\n\n\n**Looking outwards**\n\nWhen M&A leadership teams, decision committees and integration task forces are\nmainly composed of experts of the acquiring company, the tactical integration\nplans are solely built based on the assumptions of the dominant culture.\n\n> There is a need to really get to know the underlying identity of the\n> acquired organisation\n\nAs they get a clear mandate to integrate, find synergies, implement best\npractices and get a return on investment as fast as possible, there is a risk\nthey overlook the original strategic intent of the acquisition and overwhelm\nthe new partner with an integration overload of dashboards and processes that\nare not suited to their context and operational reality. This often leads to a\nprolonged overload on the organisation and a strong internal focus, putting\nthe market connections and client relationships at risk.\n\nIt is critical to go beyond mapping the technical base, asset network, HR\npolicies and client-relationship model. There is a need to really get to know\nthe underlying identity of the acquired organisational system, its timeline,\nthe critical events that have shaped its identity, the underlying dynamics\ncurrently at play. Taking the time to hear their stories will accelerate the\nintegration process afterwards.\n\nEven when a cultural compatibility assessment has been part of the due\ndiligence phase, it often stays on the surface and does not uncover the deeper\nsystemic dynamics that will show up in the integration phase and might\njeopardise integration success.\n\nThe systemic principles listed below can be used as a lens to look at both\nplayers \u2013 the acquirer and the acquired - and understand the cultural identity\nand dynamics on a deeper level.\n\nAs a result, the future desired culture can begin to take shape, not as a copy\nof the dominant culture, not as a half-hearted compromise between both, but as\nthe one that fits the new combined organisational system.\n\n  * Purpose\n\nWhat was our/their founding story?\n\nWhat is our/their current purpose, the reason to exist? What is society\ninviting us/them to do?\n\nWhat are our/their guiding principles?\n\nWhich events on our timeline have shaped our/their identity?\n\n  * Connection\n\nWhat is our/their narrative that connects all stakeholders to that purpose,\nthat engages them in a dream, in a story, in a new reality?\n\nWhat is our/their vision, the one that comes with personal commitment and\ntough choices\n\n  * Inclusion\n\nWho belongs to our/their organisational system? What does it take to belong?\n\nWhat is our/their organisational design and how is it tailored to the purpose?\n\nWhat has made us/them successful? It might be because of a specific agile org\nchart or highly connected relationship structure\n\nWhere did we deviate from what the optimal organisational structure would be?\n\n  * Order\n\nWhat are our/their (often unspoken) criteria to define order in decision\nmaking? It might be based on job titles, levels, tenure or nationality, on\ncontribution to innovation, outside perspective and job rotation.\n\n  * Exchange\n\nHow is our/their company\u2019s vitality?\n\nIs there flow, energy, rumble, creative conflict, diversity of thought? A high\nlevel of trust, cross-fertilisation beyond the company gates?\n\nWhat has been the cost of change, and who paid the price?\n\nThese are some examples of the systemic questions to be asked. As you are\ninviting honest dialogues about those questions and jointly uncover the real\nanswers, you can bring to the surface the roots of persistent cultural\nroadblocks and consciously build the new, leading to a smoother, faster and\nmore successful integration, engaged employees who connect quickly to the new\nidentity and a value- and purpose-based culture that fosters innovation,\ncreativity and a mindset of continuous improvement and transformation.\n\n[![](https://workplaceinsight.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mieke-Jacobs-and-\nPaul-Zonneveld.jpg)](https://workplaceinsight.net/author/mieke-jacobs-and-\npaul-zonneveld/)\n\n[Mieke

About one in three leaders called\ntheirs 'sufficient', with another 9% praising current programs as 'excellent'.\n\nHRD spoke to an industry leader to find out top mistakes leaders make during\nonboarding and why you should avoid them.\n\n[READ MORE: 5 steps for an effective onboarding\nprocess](https://www.hcamag.com/asia/specialisation/employee-\nengagement/5-steps-for-an-effective-onboarding-process/178250)\n\n**1\\.

Being short-sighted with the entire onboarding experience**  \nIt's common for onboarding programs to last about one month, he said.

Aliogo\n\nAs Nigeria\u2019s coronavirus lockdown continues to take a toll on organisations,\nespecially Small Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs), the Managing Partner at HR-\nEX Consulting, Enitan Oyenuga, has advised organisations and businesses to put\nmeasures in place to manage cost.\n\nOyenuga, who disclosed to THISDAY in a statement said people cost is one of\nthe biggest expenses on the income statement of any business and depending on\nthe business size, can account for up to 70% of overall business cost.\n\nShe stated that cost on the part of small businesses is likely to cause a\nswift and unexpected shift in the economy especially with the current\nsituation of the country due to the corona virus pandemic, thereby leading to\nrapid depletion in cash and bankruptcy.\n\nShe maintained that working with a group of small business, it was discovered\nthat there are actions small businesses are taking to minimise the impact of\nthese changes and safeguard the future of their businesses, \u201cI do hope these\nideas will help you land on a solution that works for your own business.\u201d\n\nOyenuga further explained that in the light of the national lockdown to combat\nthe spread of COVID-19, a number of companies are responding with pay cuts.\n\nShe remarked that with large cuts at leadership levels and graduated\npercentage reduction below the management team; it has been observed that\nleadership, \u201cin some of the worse hit sectors completely foregoing their\nsalary, implementing up to 50% pay cuts for management level employees and\n30-25% for the rest of the organisation.\u201d\n\nShe affirmed that in implementing a salary cut, an organisation must ensure no\none is paid below the minimum wage, communicate a timeframe for the pay\nreduction, exempt low-wage employees, get the employees\u2019 consent prior to\neffecting the change and others.\n\nOyenuga, who highlighted the place of unpaid leave (furlough) in\norganisations, said it is an employer-mandate temporary unpaid leave from\nwork.\n\nShe argued that mandatory unpaid leave could last a few weeks or months,\nadding that this is usually a preferred option to layoffs as it allows\nemployers very easily reduce people costs without adding on new costs and\nsafeguard knowledge accumulated about the business and industry.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cIn addition, with replacement cost valued at about 33% of\nannual salary for the role, unpaid leave means a savings in recruitment and\nonboarding costs when business as usual resumes, allowing for employees to\neasily pick up from where they left off. If you decide on mandatory unpaid\nleave, consider how to figure out your critical staffing for the period. You\nmay want to consider the work that is required, work schedule or rosters,\nexisting performance data performance and skills required during this period.\nEngage them on the need to cover the reduced workload. Engage and inform all\nemployees on the change (the alternative being employee layoffs). Communicate\na timeframe for the unpaid leave period. Get the employee\u2019s consent prior to\neffecting the change. If the situation is likely to continue after the set\nperiod, inform well in advance.\u201d\n\n### Share this:\n\n  *

Not just because university students have finally completed\ntheir studies and are eager to enter the job market; but also because everyone\n\u2013 from managers to junior workers \u2013 has returned from their summer holidays,\nrelaxed and refreshed, with more time on their hands to interview, job hunt\nand apply for new positions having had the time on holiday to reflect on their\ncareers. Even those who aren\u2019t employed, come September, tend to want to get\nback into work. In 2018, for example, the number of people working in the UK\nincreased from June-August to September-November by 75%.\n\nIt\u2019s therefore inevitably a busy time for all HR teams, who will be working to\neffectively onboard and offboard new employees, as well as guide newly\npromoted individuals through role transitions. While these procedures are\nusually seen as strictly related to employee experience, they also have\nbenefits to the organisation. As employees join, move around and leave the\ncompany, their responsibilities evolve and, to effectively carry them out,\nworkers require access to different kinds of resources \u2013 from devices to\nsoftware and folders containing useful data. The administration of these\nchanges is known as identity or access management. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s important\nto businesses and why HR teams need to be clued up about it.\n\n**The role of employee experience**\n\nRecently, the focus on employee experience has increased exponentially,\nbecause businesses appreciate that satisfied employees perform better and are\nmore loyal. The onboarding process plays a key part in ensuring workers are\nengaged and motivated from day one and it generally involves introducing new\nhires to the team, showing them around the facilities and making sure they\u2019re\ncomfortable with their responsibilities. However, there is another side to\nonboarding which is equally significant. HR must work alongside IT to ensure\nthe new starters\u2019 information is correctly uploaded to the database and that\nthey are granted access to the files, devices and software they need to do\ntheir job. The reason why these actions are so crucial is twofold. Firstly, if\nHR and IT don\u2019t liaise effectively to enable employees to utilise the\nnecessary documents or applications, they stand in the way of that employee\u2019s\nperformance, leading to the business wasting precious time. Secondly, it\u2019s\nimportant to bear in mind that workers seek a sense of accomplishment, they\nvalue success and growth opportunities. If they are unable to do their job\nbecause they can\u2019t access the right resources at the right time, their\nproductivity and professional development are seriously hindered \u2013 making them\nfeel frustrated and unsatisfied.\n\nThis logic isn\u2019t only valid when new employees join the company, but also when\nthey are promoted or change teams. Starting a new role within the same\norganisation can be nerve-wracking \u2013 people obviously want to prove that they\nare worthy of their new position and strive to do their best work. However,\nthis may be difficult for example, if the HR and IT teams fail to update job\ntitles in the system, preventing individuals from visualising the resources\nthey should now have access to due to their promotion. That\u2019s why it is\nfundamental for these processes to be as streamlined as possible.\n\n**Offboarding and security**\n\nIt\u2019s true \u2013 visibility of company servers and software should be enabled\nquickly and consistently so as to maximise staff efficiency. Yet, access\nshouldn\u2019t always be granted, but also monitored, regulated and sometimes\nprohibited. Think of all the sensitive information \u2013 on both customers and\nemployees \u2013 a company\u2019s network holds, which would be catastrophic if it fell\ninto the wrong hands. That\u2019s why a fool-proof offboarding process is as\ncrucial as effective onboarding. When employees leave the business, it\u2019s HR\u2019s\nresponsibility to conduct a final interview to safeguard the relationship and\npotentially gather useful insights on their experience with the company. But\nthat\u2019s not all. HR should coordinate the offboarding process with IT so that\nthe system is immediately updated and all access to company resources is\nrevoked. Imagine a resentful former employee retaining access to confidential\ninformation about their colleagues or the company itself \u2013 this could likely\nlead to data theft. The same can be said about employees departing from one\nteam and joining another within the same company \u2013 think of a finance\nexecutive who decides to pursue a more creative career path in marketing. It\u2019s\nnot just about coaching them about their new responsibilities and performance\nobjectives, it\u2019s also critical that their digital rights are revised so as to\nnot allow them to continue to view, for example, other employees\u2019 payroll\ndetails.\n\n**A little help**\n\nWhen administrative processes such as these are completed manually, human\nerror can lead to serious problems. That\u2019s why businesses can\u2019t afford to let\nHR and IT handle them without a little help. Companies in industries with high\nturnover rates or that encourage internal mobility should turn to automation\nto simplify onboarding, offboarding and identity management. An \u2018identity\nwarehouse\u2019 should be updated by the HR team with every employee\u2019s information\non role, team and seniority and must be in sync with the automated solution.\nThis tool can then automatically match workers to access rights, making life\ninfinitely easier for HR professionals \u2013 who no longer have to worry about\nwhether each staff member is equipped with the necessary resources.\n\nIdentity management has a huge impact on employee satisfaction, productivity\nand security \u2013 things businesses simply cannot afford to compromise on. That\u2019s\nwhy it\u2019s time for them to support HR and IT teams with the right technology.\n\n[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nseamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-\nagility%2F&linkname=How%20seamless%20onboarding%20and%20offboarding%20can%20enhance%20performance%2C%20security%20and%20agility\n\"Facebook\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nseamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-\nagility%2F&linkname=How%20seamless%20onboarding%20and%20offboarding%20can%20enhance%20performance%2C%20security%20and%20agility\n\"Twitter\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/linkedin?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nseamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-\nagility%2F&linkname=How%20seamless%20onboarding%20and%20offboarding%20can%20enhance%20performance%2C%20security%20and%20agility\n\"LinkedIn\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/pinterest?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nseamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-\nagility%2F&linkname=How%20seamless%20onboarding%20and%20offboarding%20can%20enhance%20performance%2C%20security%20and%20agility\n\"Pinterest\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/tumblr?linkurl=http%3A%2F%2Fhrnews.co.uk%2Fhow-\nseamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-\nagility%2F&linkname=How%20seamless%20onboarding%20and%20offboarding%20can%20enhance%20performance%2C%20security%20and%20agility\n\"Tumblr\")[](https://www.addtoany.com/share)\n\n[![site\nstats](//c.statcounter.com/11595372/0/07b12b60/0/)](http://statcounter.com/\n\"site stats\")\n\n**Author:** Editorial Team\n\nShare This Post On\n\n  * [Google](https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-seamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-agility/)\n  * [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?s=100&p\\[url\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-seamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-agility/&p\\[images\\]\\[0\\]=http://hrnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wix-150x150.jpg&p\\[title\\]=How seamless onboarding and offboarding can enhance performance, security and agility)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://hrnews.co.uk/how-seamless-onboarding-and-offboarding-can-enhance-performance-security-and-agility/&text=How seamless onboarding and offboarding can enhance performance, security and agility)\n\n#### View all categories\n\nView all categories Select Category Absence Management and Mental Health ACAS\nNews Adrian Lewis' Blog Agriculture AI & Employment Apprentices & Millenials\nAPSCo News Awards Benefits & Reward Bereavement Leave Brexit and HR Business\nFunding Case Studies Charity News Childcare CIPD News Construction Contractors\n& Temporary Staff COVID-19 CSR & Staff Fundraising Customer Service Danielle\nAyres' Blog Data Security Disability at work Discrimination Diversity Dress\nCodes Employee Engagement Energy news Engineering News Events Finance &\nBanking Gossip Financial Education Flexible Working Food & Beverage Industry\nGamification GDPR Gender Equality Generation Z Global Mobility Guest Blogs\nfrom HR People Hannah Dahill's Blog Health & Safety Heather's Blog Hospitality\nNews HR Bodies HR in Education HR Manager of the Month Award HR Networking HR\nNews HR People's Guest Blog HR Supplier News HSE Immigration Immigration &\nMigrant Workers Industrial Relations Industry Sector News Insurance James\nDevine's Blog: HR at the Sharp End Jobs News Law firm news Leadership Legal\nNews Living & Minimum Wage News Logistics News Maternity & the Law Mature\nWorkers Mental Health Awareness Week New Appointments NHS News Nick Soret's\nBlog Occupational Health Oil Industry Parental Leave Pensions Performance\nAppraisals Pharmaceutical Sector Psychometrics Public Sector Recruitment\nRedundancy Retail News Robey's Blog - Faith, HR and Charity Safety Clothing\nShakira's Blog Staff Holiday Planning Staff Wellbeing News Steel &\nManufacturing Talent shortages Tech Industry The Gig Economy Training,\nLearning & Development Transport Travel News TUC News Uncategorized Wages\nWales HR News Wellbeing Whistleblowing\n\nSearch for:\n\nJobs for HR Manager\n\nThere is connection error.

With the Garage, it's about changing the culture, and bringing\ntogether those people who aren't always together \u2026 Often they're operating in\nsilos but what this does is bring them across end-to-end,\" Woodside Energy\nchief digital officer Shelley Kalms said on Tuesday.\n\nAs one of four current IBM Garage customers in Australia, Woodside approached\nIBM Garage to help the company improve its HR onboarding process, which Kalms\ndescribed as often being confusing.\n\n\"You have to go into a number of systems. I remember on my first day I didn't\nget something, so I had to fill out a form and I didn't get it until two weeks\nlater; I wasn't productive straight away. But what we're trying to do is give\na sense of belonging, a sense of purpose straight away,\" she said.\n\n\"The reason why we did this example is because it resonates with everyone.\nEveryone has had a first day. We want to show this is what it was, and this is\nwhat it is re-imagined. We want to show that step change so we can help people\nthink and be unrestrained in their thinking going forward.\"\n\n**See also:**[ **Recruiting and hiring top talent: A guide for business\nleaders (free PDF)**](https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-\nlibrary/whitepapers/recruiting-and-hiring-top-talent-a-guide-for-business-\nleaders-free-pdf/) **(TechRepublic)**\n\nAs part of the process, team members from different parts of the Woodside\nbusiness, including HR, contractor and procurement, security and emergency\nmanagement, and digital, have undertaken design thinking workshops, data-\ndriven research, and formulated experiments.\n\n\"What we're trying to do at Woodside is unlock the collective intelligence of\nthe organisation -- past and present -- by bringing the data, information, and\ninsights for our people,\" Kalms said.\n\nShe said the most pivotal point of the process to date has been when Woodside\nemployees participating in the workshops began changing their attitudes.\n\n\"You had people coming with questions of have you thought about this, have you\nconsidered that, and that was key,\" she said.\n\nBut the process hasn't been completely seamless. Kalms said parts of the\nbusiness that have been traditionally accustomed to a certain way of thinking\nhave questioned the design thinking process. To overcome the challenges within\nthe project, as well as to enhance the digital skills of its workforce,\nWoodside will launch what it's calling a digital academy.\n\n\"That's really about helping the digital function but also the wider\nenterprise to lift their digital skills and how we use technology. Technology\ncan be really exciting and fun but we're very disciplined,\" she said.\n\n\"We always start with what is the opportunity and the problem we're trying to\nsolve because you can be taken away by the technology sometimes and you forget\nto solve the problem. That can take time some time.\"\n\nShe added Woodside was motivated to change its way of thinking with IBM Garage\nmainly because former transformations have never stuck.\n\n\"We work in agile, we do MVP and some waterfall projects, but often the\nbusiness says this is what it wants \u2026 but often what they get is not what they\nwanted. Taking them on the journey is very important and this is what this\ndoes. We're giving them product ownership and bringing the business into re-\nimagining because they're the ones who know the business processes.\"\n\n### RELATED COVERAGE\n\n[ **Woodside Petroleum focused on a data-driven\nfuture**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/woodside-petroleum-focused-on-a-data-\ndriven-future/)\n\nHeading down a data science path kicked off an innovative culture within\nWoodside Petroleum, but most importantly it helped solve some business\nproblems the exploration giant was struggling with, its CDO has said.\n\n[ **IT budgets 2020: How the money will be spent, and who will spend\nit**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/it-budgets-2020-how-the-money-will-be-\nspent-and-who-will-spend-it/)\n\nIT budgeting is challenging at the best of times, but for 2020 an extra\nhelping of political and economic instability -- possibly even global\nrecession -- will make things even harder for CIOs.\n\n[ **Digital transformation: How to make sure your project is a\nsuccess**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/digital-transformation-how-to-make-\nsure-your-project-is-a-success/)\n\nFrom building enthusiasm for change to experimenting with innovations, four\ndigital leaders explain how to ensure your digitalisation project remains on\nthe right track.\n\n **[Why 82% of HR leaders predict their role will be unrecognizable in 10\nyears](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-82-of-hr-leaders-predict-\ntheir-role-will-be-unrecognizable-in-10-years/) **(TechRepublic)\n\nAs modes of work change with technology, the role of HR follows.

Managers wrongly assume people who accept a job are \u2018lucky\u2019,\nyet we see situations where new employees don\u2019t show up to work on the first\nday or quit after a few days for another job because they are poorly treated\nduring this critical time period,\u201d says Brian Kropp, group vice president of\nresearch at Gartner\u2019s human resources practice.\n\n> When new employees feel accepted and like they belong within an\n> organisation, better individual and organisational outcomes follow\n\n[A recent survey](https://cezannehr.com/news/survey-reveals-uk-organisations-\nsuffer-from-non-starter-syndrome/) by Cezanne HR of 250 senior human resources\npractitioners across the UK found nearly two-thirds have had new recruits quit\nbefore they even start.\n\nBut what should business leaders do to create that all-important positive\nfirst impression?\n\nFor starters, they need to think beyond the interview and job-offer stages,\nand [look at their overall employer brand,](https://www.raconteur.net/risk-\nmanagement/insurance-talent-crisis) says Beverley Nicholas, UK talent director\nat recruitment company PageGroup.\n\n[\u201cEngagement starts when somebody sees a job\nad](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/hire-vs-inspire) and considers applying for\nit, therefore it\u2019s important for a company to consider how it positions itself\nexternally when trying to attract new talent. What is your employer brand? Are\nyou giving candidates enough exposure to your business vision and values in an\nauthentic way? Then it\u2019s about being consistent from then on, with an\nonboarding programme that reinforces your message,\u201d she says.\n\n####  **Tech can give managers more time for human side of onboarding**\n\n[One of the biggest barriers to early engagement\n](https://www.raconteur.net/infographics/7-reasons-why-businesses-need-to-\nprioritise-employee-engagement)is that line managers feel they are simply too\nbusy. To combat this problem, many human resources departments are turning to\ntechnology to automate some of the process.\n\nGoogle, for example, uses an electronic checklist to remind managers to\ndiscuss things such as roles and responsibilities with new hires. Similarly,\nemployee engagement tech firm, Reward Gateway, has a 48-hour promise of\ncommunication to all job applicants that it fulfils with the help of prompts\nfrom its smart hub technology.\n\nFurthermore, candidates and new hires get access to the platform for pre-\ninterview resources, videos and other materials to help them engage with the\ncompany brand. They also get access to another portal, called Smart Spending,\nwhere they can take advantage of discounts and cashback.\n\n\u201cBy the interview and first working day, we want new employees to have a high\nlevel of brand knowledge and to be excited because they recognise the people\nthey meet and the things they encounter; that is really, really important,\u201d\nsays Gemma Matthews, head of talent acquisition at Reward Gateway.\n\nOnline platforms can also be [used to do much of the administration \u201cheavy\nlifting\u201d](https://www.raconteur.net/hr/ai-hr-human) before a new starter\u2019s\nfirst day to save managers and the human resources department\u2019s time, says\nJames Allen, group operations director at Airswift, a workforce solutions\nprovider to the energy and infrastructure industries.\n\n\u201cTechnology can help issue policies, procedures, guidelines and other\ninformation before recruits start so they are familiar with the company before\nthey join, which can help breakdown nervousness about starting a new job, as\nwell as taking care of all the admin,\u201d he says.\n\n####  **New starters must be welcomed into work environment socially**\n\n[![](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/EE_p18_2-e1559664739403.jpg)](https://www.raconteur.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/06/EE_p18_2-e1559664739403.jpg)It\u2019s equally important,\naccording to Talya Bauer, Cameron professor of management at Portland State\nUniversity, Oregon, to integrate new employees to the social side of work\nright away, because onboarding \u201cis much more than just about orientation\u201d.\n\nA meta-analysis conducted by Professor Bauer and a colleague examined 70\nseparate studies and determined that [feeling socially accepted was a key\nfactor in newcomer success.](https://www.raconteur.net/business-\ninnovation/company-culture-need-vitamin-aspirin)\n\n\u201cWhen new employees feel accepted and like they belong within an organisation,\nbetter individual and organisational outcomes follow; investing in this\nrelationship early on sends a positive signal that the company cares about its\nemployees,\u201d she says.\n\nIn fact, the complete onboarding process shouldn\u2019t stop when the paperwork is\ncomplete, but should take anything up to a year, depending on the complexity\nof the role and business, says Ms Nicholas. But the first month is critical.\n\n\u201cDuring this time,[ successful businesses will buddy people\nup](https://www.raconteur.net/business-innovation/work-friendships-secret-\nproductivity), run breakfast sessions between CEOs and new starters and\ngenerally be fairly creative about the whole onboarding process,\u201d she says.\n\nCompanies such as Google and Zappos, an online shoes retailer based in\nAmerica, offer induction courses over several weeks.\n\n####  **Culture and engagement particularly at risk with relocation**\n\nA focus on employee engagement during onboarding is [doubly important when new\nhires are relocating for a job; ](https://www.raconteur.net/finance/talent-\nmanagement-offshore-finance)companies should consider both the financial and\nemotional impact of such a move.\n\n\u201cForty per cent of all international assignments still fail, yet research has\nshown providing adequate support throughout the relocation and onboarding\nprocess is the key to better adjustment in the new environment,\u201d says Dr\nWashika Haak-Saheem, associate professor in human resource management at\nHenley Business School.\n\nAs a minimum, companies should[ consider assigning a local sponsor to support\nthe relocation](https://www.raconteur.net/business-innovation/employers-help-\nhousing) and human resources managers should stay in frequent contact with\nemployees to act quickly if any intervention is needed. They should also\nconsider the needs of the immediate family, as maladjustment of family members\nis one of the major reasons for assignment failure, she adds.\n\nFor business leaders and human resources departments, installing processes and\ninvesting in technology to foster positive engagement between the company and\nnew recruits can be overwhelming, but whatever firms do, they should aim\nalways to reflect the mission and culture of their company.\n\n\u201cStart with the basic foundations and build from there,\u201d says Ms Nicholas.\nThis might be as simple as listing employee benefits, such as flexible working\non job adverts. And the best place to seek further direction? Direct from\nemployee feedback. \u201cEngage with new starters and find out about their\nexperience,\u201d she adds. \u201cThere may be some really quick-and-easy wins you can\nimplement right away.\u201d\n\n# Five top tools for onboarding and employee experience\n\n **1 Onboarding platforms**\n\nShifting the onboarding process to an online platform can save human resources\ndepartments and line mangers time and effort.\n\nReward Gateway has partnered with online onboarding platform Enboarder to\ncreate on-brand messaging, distribute learning materials and necessary\ninformation for job candidates before interviews and for new employees on\ntheir first day.\n\nThe platform, which is used by McDonald\u2019s and ING, creates customised welcome\nnotes for new hires, provides prompts to managers and will monitor their\nengagement, as well as provide a tool for employee feedback.\n\n **2** **Employer surveys**\n\nFostering a culture of open communication and shared feedback between new\nstarters, human resources departments and business leaders is a great way to\nensure an employee\u2019s needs are met, and company processes and procedures are\nworking as intended.\n\nOnline staff survey platform Glint is a convenient tool to start conversations\nbetween managers and staff. At LinkedIn, all new employees are sent a Glint\nsurvey on day five, day forty-five and day ninety, and prompted to share\nfeedback about their onboarding experience which is then passed to managers.\nLinkedIn liked Glint so much it acquired the company in 2008.\n\nThe survey tool, which is also used by Ericsson and Roche, helps \u201copen the\ndoors of communication\u201d, according to LinkedIn\u2019s senior vice president and\nchief people officer Christina Hall, making it easy for employers to gather\ninformation, make a word cloud of key words employees use in their comments\nand take any appropriate action.\n\n **3** **Interactive videos**\n\nSome companies are using virtual reality (VR) and similar technology to create\nimmersive and interactive videos that convey company culture and provide a\nunique insight into their operations.\n\nToyota Motor Europe offers video tours, created by digital learning company\nSponge, of the entire customer journey to induct new hires into the company\nethos, aims and goals.\n\nSimilarly, DHL uses VR training platform Immerse to challenge new recruits and\nexisting employees to compete against each other to stack virtual packages\nagainst the clock while following standard operating procedures. The task has\ncreated friendly competition between new and old employees, and training for\nnew hires.\n\n **4** **Employer brand**\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like public online feedback to motivate good recruitment and\nonboarding performance. Website Glassdoor, much like TripAdvisor, allows job\nsearchers to write and read reviews of more than 600,000 companies, including\nPwC, KPMG and Tesco, to discover what the firms are really like from people\nwho've actually worked there.\n\nNot only can the platform be used as a way to create a great independent\ninsight into company culture and ethos, but it can encourage staff to engage\nwith the feedback. For example, the leadership team at Reward Gateway has an\nin-house commitment to reply to every review left on the platform.\n\n **5** **Collaboration tools and apps**\n\nInviting future employees on to online social tools, such as apps and\nmessengers, can be a great catalyst for interactions between new and soon-to-\nbe colleagues. Branded communications company Speakap found 19 per cent of the\n1,000 global respondents it surveyed said being invited to join an employee\nmessenger app to chat with colleagues before the first day of work made them\nfeel connected to the company.\n\nSpeakap, which is used by Bosch and IKEA, provides mobile or desktop apps to\nco-ordinate company communications, as well as provide a place for news\nupdates, employee profiles, document management and event-sharing.\n\nAnother enduringly popular work communications app is Slack, which now has\nmore than ten million daily active users globally.\n\nAlso found in [Disengagement](https://www.raconteur.net/tag/disengagement)\n[attracting

recruits&body='https://www.cityam.com/ace-onboarding-new-employees/ ')\n\n[Chloe Comperat](https://www.cityam.com/profile/chloe-comperat/ \"Posts by\nChloe Comperat\")\n\nChlo\u00e9 Comp\u00e9rat is part of the UK launch team at HR software company PayFit.\n\n![onboarding](https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/businessmen-\nhandshake-corbis-1024x640-57ed8a908d08c-57ed8a90bf74a.jpg)\n\nDid you know that only 44 per cent of new employees report a positive\nexperience after joining an organisation? The first day at a new job can be\ntough and, if done badly, downright depressing.\n\nNew starters often report poor sleep  or even sleepless nights on the run-up\nto their first day \u2013 it has a massive emotional impact.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t have to be the case. [A good onboarding\nprocess](https://www.cityam.com/lyft-onboards-jp-morgan-credit-suisse-and-\njefferies-lead/) can help ease anxiety and self-doubt.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, it has a significant effect on retention. A huge 90\nper cent of new employees take six months to decide whether to commit\nthemselves to their new employer over the long term. So if their onboarding\nperiod is a success, staff churn could be reduced. It\u2019s a simple solution to\nan expensive problem.\n\nWith that in mind, what can you do to improve your company\u2019s onboarding\nprocess?\n\n## Forget onboarding, start with pre-boarding\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to begin the onboarding process before the first day. Research\nshows that businesses that have a pre-boarding process retain 81 per cent of\ntheir first-year hires.\n\nEngaging your new employees will help them fall in love with your business,\nand stick around for longer. And this starts with the offer letter.\n\nThink about tearing up the traditional letter. We\u2019ve seen huge success in\ngetting the design team to develop an offer slide or presentation. Keep it\nshort, sweet, fun, and factual. Make sure to include the salary, start date,\nbonus structure, employee benefits, additional package information, company\nstructure, and a timeline for their first day or week. Some companies even\ninclude a message from the chief executive or country manager.\n\n## Avoid a boring first day\n\nGet the paperwork done before the new employee starts. It is boring, and could\nleave a sour taste. Instead, send out those forms and manuals ahead of time,\nor use HR software to create an onboarding checklist, and to collect personal\ndetails and documents.\n\nAlso, assign the new recruit an office buddy before they join. The task of the\noffice buddy is to help new recruits through the first week and make that\ninitial experience enjoyable and memorable, rather than daunting and\nchallenging. Questions that may have been left unanswered can be quickly\nremedied too.  \n\n## Start training early\n\nIn the first week, 76 per cent of employees believe that training is the most\nimportant factor. So during this week, it is more than possible to begin\ntraining on time management, all common systems and processes, and brand, such\nas tone-of-voice workshops.\n\nChallenger bank Monzo has one of the most impressive onboarding first week\nexperiences that we\u2019ve seen. It makes sure that a new employee has received\nall the vital paperwork before they start. New starters are also set up on\nSlack, and their Monzo emails are ready before they begin, so that the recruit\ncan dip their toes into conversations or watch from afar.\n\nThese simple and practical steps are designed to help employers give their new\nemployee a great onboarding experience \u2013 and, crucially, increase the chances\nof retaining them.\n\n _Main image credit: Getty_\n\n _City A.M.'s opinion pages are a place for thought-provoking views and\ndebate.

Do I wait around for them? What if it takes\nthem a lot longer to bring me on than I can afford? What if they never bring\nme on and terminate my employment before I even start? What if I go to work\nfor someone else and then this employer wants me to start?\n\n**First Answer:**\n\nCongratulations on your new job.\n\nMy initial question is: what is the rest of their employee population doing?\nPresumably, most people are working remotely. I would approach the hiring\nmanager and ask if you can do the same.\n\nLayout a specific strategy for how you will ramp up, taking the responsibility\nfor introducing yourself to people, learning the organization\u2019s technical\ntools, and understanding what and how your boss would like to receive in terms\nof work product. If there\u2019s an onboarding system you can access online, so\nmuch the better.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that anyone new will hire you until the COVID crisis subsides,\nso I would do your best to work with your new employer. Even if you didn\u2019t\nalready sign a contract with a specific start date (which gives you more\nleverage), hopefully, the organization will be sensitive to your situation.\n\n_\u2014 Alexandra Levit, author of[They Don\u2019t Teach Corporate in\nCollege](https://www.amazon.com/They-Teach-Corporate-College-Twenty-\nSomethings/dp/1601633084)_\n\n**Second Answer:**\n\nTo all of these questions I would ask one in return: What do we know for\ncertain about how COVID-19 will impact us next week?\n\nThe answer to that is simple, nothing is certain when it comes to COVID-19.\nWith this uncertainty looming over, when starting a new job you need to try to\nget as much clarity as possible on the current opportunity while creating a\ncontingency plan.\n\nTo get clarity, reach out to the employer and ask if there is an opportunity\nto begin work remotely, or part-time while the company navigates COVID-19.\nThis will allow you to potentially begin work and show flexibility with the\ndownside of it being at partial hours or pay. As COVID-19 could continue on\nfor many more weeks also establish a set a timeline, either bi-weekly or\nmonthly, for employment status check-ins with HR or management.\n\nWhat I can say with certainty is that you want to keep this employment option\nopen as COVID-19 is effecting employment rates and making the market extremely\ncompetitive. While you are maintaining regular check-ins and showcasing\nadaptability to your potential new job, continue to build your virtual\nnetwork, apply for new roles, and build new skills. This will ensure that if\nyou have to pivot due to the employer ultimately terminating the offer or\ntaking too long to officially hire you, that you will be ahead of the game.\n\nIf you are a university student and this opportunity was for your summer job,\nbegin thinking of a back-up plan now, as there are only so many summers you\nget during your university career. Back-ups can include online summer courses,\npursuing a remote internship, and if the internship market is saturated\nlooking to international internships completed remotely, or, developing a new\nskill by completing an online course in project management, foreign language,\nsoftware system or more.\n\n_\u2014[Jillian Low](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jillianlow/), Director of\nUniversity Partnerships for CRCC Asia_\n\n**Third Answer:**\n\nThis is a difficult response in a challenging time for anyone to receive. No\ndoubt disappointing, deflating and demotivating. That said, the employer may\nbe saving you some disappointment down the line when you\u2019ve got less\nopportunity to pivot. Most of the \u2018what if\u2019s\u2019 won\u2019t be able to be answered for\nsome time so now is a good time to add to the eggs in your basket.\n\nSince this employer thinks highly enough of you to want to employ you,\nconsider following up to see what projects you might be able to work on\nremotely in the near term. If they don\u2019t have any at the ready, suggest some\nthat might be of interest to them based on what you already know of the\nindustry. It\u2019s also a good time for back-up options to pursue jobs with other\nemployers. That might mean reaching out to career services to set up\ninterviews, or doing so on your own, with the employers who are still\nrecruiting. It might mean finding some micro-internships on sites like Parker\nDewey. It may also be a good time to take a step back and read some of the\nmany prognosticators out there talking about what COVID 19 is likely to mean\nfor the job market 3, 6, 9 months from now and see which industries are\nexpected to benefit. Do any new interests or ideas emerge?\n\nOf course, it\u2019s never a bad time to network and letting folks know of your\ncurrent status would make sense. Remember that everyone is going through a lot\nof uncertainty so starting off your network outreach with a \u2018how are things\nfor you\u2019 rather than \u2018here\u2019s what I need from you\u2019 is likely to get a far\nbetter response.\n\n_\u2014[Pam Baker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pamjbaker/), Founder and CEO of\nJourneous_\n\n**Fourth Answer:**\n\nDo I wait around for them? What if it takes them a lot longer to bring me on\nthan I can afford? Considering the current situation, having any opportunity\nat a possible job is a chance many people would love to have.\n\nIn my opinion, I would definitely weigh my options. It depends on your current\nsituation and if you can afford to have your future employer turn you down\nafter weeks or months of waiting.\n\nIf this employer terminates your contract before you even begin, then they\nmade a more decision to even begin the hiring process when they didn\u2019t have\nthe resources to follow through.\n\nIn my last thoughts, I would encourage you too always have multiple job offers\nand opportunities on the table so you remain the power position. It\u2019s\nfrustrating as a job seeker when you put all your eggs in one basket and that\nbasket doesn\u2019t turn out successful.\n\n_\u2014[Lorenz Esposito](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenz-v-esposito/), Digital\nMarketer at Potentialpark_\n\n**Fifth Answer:**\n\nIn my opinion, the best course of action is to try to get an assurance from\nyour new employer that your job offer is solid and won\u2019t be rescinded. I would\ntry to get it in writing. Be polite about your request, and simply explain\nthat you are a bit anxious due to the outbreak of covid 19 and you\u2019re dotting\nyour i\u2019s and crossing your t\u2019s.\n\nIf your employer writes you that the job offer is solid, I would take him at\nhis word. If your employer won\u2019t put it in writing, then I think it\u2019s fair for\nyou to try to secure another job.\n\nThese are uncertain times, and we are all navigating through them. If you go\nwork for someone else, the best way to possibly keep the door open at the\nfirst employer is to write a heartfelt note that due to financial\ncircumstances, you felt it prudent to take another job and that you hope he\nunderstands.\n\n_\u2014 Vicky Oliver, author of[301 Smart Answers to Tough Interview Questions\n](https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Answers-Tough-Interview-Questions-\nebook/dp/B001POX728)(Sourcebooks, 2005) and [Bad Bosses, Crazy Coworkers &\nOther Office Idiots](https://www.amazon.com/Bosses-Crazy-Coworkers-Office-\nIdiots/dp/1402212534) (Sourcebooks 2008)._\n\n![Print Friendly, PDF &\nEmail](https://cdn.printfriendly.com/buttons/printfriendly-pdf-email-button-\nnotext.png)\n\nRelated posts:\n\n  1.

But there are a whole\nhost of factors that are sending ripples of change through companies as we\nspeak.\n\nGeneration Z is shaping businesses. Employers recognize the importance of\nemployee wellbeing, and the use of AI-enabled machines is seeping into all\nareas of business decision-making.\n\nWe\u2019ve come up with the top 5 HR tech trends to help see off the rest of the\nyear and give companies plenty to think about as they welcome 2020.\n\n## **#1 Using AI in recruitment**\n\nAI, or Artificial Intelligence, has been a hot topic for a while. Any company\nwishing to remain competitive, at the forefront of technology, and with the\nvery best systems in place will be considering AI as a critical part of their\nstrategy.\n\nIf you are applying to work for a large company, your job application will\nprobably be filtered and reviewed by an algorithm. [AI is set to dominate HR\nrecruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/how-to-succeed-with-ai-in-recruiting/) for more companies in\nthe coming years. Algorithms are being used to pre-screen, select, and even\nprovide feedback to applicants.\n\n## **#2 Enhancing Employee Wellbeing with Systems**\n\nBurnout, stress, and mental health issues are an issue in the workplace. A\nGallup study of 7,500 workers conducted in 2018 found that 23% felt very often\nor always burned out at work. These statistics are indicative of the scale of\nthe problem.\n\nOf course, people who feel overworked are often less productive. Yet there are\nother impacts, including increased time off work, and employee churn.\n\nCompanies are beginning to utilize everything from gamification and wearables\nto digital cognitive-behavioral therapy tools to support employees and help\nthem get back on track. Algorithms, using machine learning, are also being\nused for employee management. For example, algorithms can help identify who is\nat risk of leaving the company, and approaches that can be undertaken to help\nretain their best employees.\n\n## **#3 Working Remotely and The Gig Economy**\n\nOne approach that companies are implementing to make themselves more\nattractive for employees and offer the best work-life balance is a work from\nhome policy. Once either impractical or a one-off luxury, companies are\nstarting to see the multiple benefits of [out-of-office\nworking](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/work-from-\nhome-week-initiatives-help-manage-remote-workers-better/).\n\nTechnology such as\n[VoIP](https://www.ringcentral.co.uk/office/features/voip/overview.html) and\nthe internet has allowed for these shifts. In addition to allowing office-\nbased employees the odd day working from home, companies are hiring remote\nworkers working from multiple static (dedicated) IP addresses.\n\nA key motivation for considering this split workforce is the rapid increase in\nthe gig economy. This option of quickly hiring freelancers enables companies\nto scale rapidly as demand increases. Allowing for a workforce of both remote\nand office-based workers will require companies to install efficient\ntechnology and undertake training to manage remote teams. Otherwise, this can\nbecome a potentially chaotic business structure.\n\n## **#4 Using Cloud-Based HR**\n\nOnline HR software has resulted in improvements in how teams are managed. A\ncloud-based platform allows HR employees to work with real-time data. Most\nplatforms enable you to manage tasks like payroll, recruitment, onboarding,\ntime-management, and benefits. With platforms being scalable, they can\naccommodate businesses of all sizes.\n\nSuch platforms can offer useful insights, some of which were touched on\nearlier. Fundamentally, HR software provides a support team with more data at\ntheir hands so they can make better-informed decisions regarding employee\nmanagement.\n\nAutomatic software updates are particularly beneficial for HR compliance. As\nprofessional vendors support cloud-based solutions, the relevant applications\nare frequently updated based on current regulations.\n\n**Learn More:[Employee Health Benefits Evolve Amidst New Regulations for\nICHRAs in 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/compensation-\nbenefits/employee-health-benefits-evolve-amidst-new-regulations-for-ichras-\nin-2020/)**\n\n## **#5 Implementing Technologies to Win Over Generation Z**\n\nHot on the tails of millennial employees is their younger siblings, Generation\nZ. And with them comes a wealth of digital knowledge. Whereas previous\ngenerations partly acquired their digital skills within the workplace,\ncompanies now need to guarantee usable technologies to attract and maintain\nthis tech-savvy generation.\n\nCompanies should look to sharpening their online brand presence and\nreputation. A LinkedIn survey found [71% of\nrecruiters](https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/talent-\nsolutions/global/en_us/c/pdfs/ultimate-list-of-employer-brand-stats.pdf)\nagreed that brand reputation was a significant factor in attracting top\ntalent. Although relevant to the entire workforce, as Generation Z are both\ndigital natives and the new talent pool, companies should be taking action to\naccommodate for this.\n\nEmployees may want to consider checking company review sites, polishing an\nonline presence, and using sleek, hyper-targeted social ads to reach the right\npeople. Employee advocacy is also paramount here. Using social media and tools\nsuch as LinkedIn Elevate will help measure employee communication and\ninteraction regarding a company brand.\n\n**Learn More:[The Future of Remote Work in 2020 and Beyond: 8 Tips for\nHR](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/mobile-workforce/future-of-remote-\nwork-tips-for-hr/)**\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-5-hr-tech-trends-to-look-out-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Top+5+HR+Tech+Trends+to+Look+Out+in+2020\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Top+5+HR+Tech+Trends+to+Look+Out+in+2020&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-5-hr-tech-trends-to-look-out-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-5-hr-tech-trends-to-look-out-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-5-hr-tech-trends-to-look-out-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Top 5 HR Tech Trends to Look Out in\n2020&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Ftop-5-hr-tech-trends-to-look-out-\nin-2020%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.

I'd worked in HR for years, in a whole bunch of different\nenvironments, from a casino to a water park to e-commerce and finally for\nbrick-and-mortar retail, and, to be frank, I just didn't like what was I\ndoing. I felt like all I did was enforce rules all day long, and deal with\ncompliance issues, and tell people what they were doing wrong. There was\nnothing fun about it. Nothing uplifting.\n\nI didn't even feel like I was me when I was at work. I didn't dress the way I\nlike to dress. I'm a ripped jeans and t-shirt kind of woman, and at one of my\nprior HR jobs they made us wear stockings. Like, pantyhose. Every day. Why?\nBecause that was the way it had always been done. Truly, there was no other\nreason.\n\nWhen I was at work at my previous job, I didn't act like I normally act. It\nwas like I put on a persona when I walked through the door. Work was just a\njob, and sometimes a miserable job, that I dragged myself to every morning\nonly to watch the clock in the afternoon \u2026\n\n![Hollie\nDelaney.](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dcf08947eece551fa5abca5.png)\n\ncaption\n\n    Hollie Delaney.\nsource\n\n    Courtesy of Hollie Delany\n\nSo when I looked into employment at Zappos for what I truly believed would be\na short stay, I grudgingly applied for an HR position. It wasn't the whole new\nworld I was hoping for, but I had heard they were a fun company. I thought\nmaybe it would at least be a somewhat enjoyable place to work while I figured\nout how to transition to an entirely different career.\n\nI remember one of the first things the person who interviewed me asked was,\n\"How would your current manager describe you?\"\n\nAnd I replied, \"They'd say I was fun, but a little weird.\"\n\n\"Really?\" she said. \"That's one of our core values: 'Create Fun and a Little\nWeirdness.'\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I said, surprised and honestly a little skeptical. Zappos wasn't widely\nknown back then. I hadn't heard a word about their \"core values\" or really\nmuch of anything else. (Turns out, they'd only just finalized the core values\nlist that very year.)\n\n\"That's weird,\" I said out loud.\n\nIt turned out that Zappos and I shared a lot of core values, once I learned\nwhat those were. I got hired. I stuck around. I moved up the ladder to become\nhead of HR, and, more than 12 years later, I'm still here. The job wasn't so\ntemporary after all!\n\nYou see, I quickly discovered that Zappos' HR department is like no other HR\ndepartment I'd ever encountered. It's fun and a little bit weird, just like\nme. And it's built on actually putting the \"human\" in human resources.\n\nWhen you hire people who are aligned with your values and the company's\nvalues, things just click - for the employee and for the company.\n\nSo how do we figure out who to hire?\n\nFirst off, we take our time. After all, if our employees are our greatest\nresource, it only makes sense that we would put some serious effort into\nfinding the right humans for our company.\n\n![](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/11/11/5dcf17697eece56b1c09f7d4.jpg)\n\ncaption\n\n    \"The Power Of Wow: How to Electrify Your Work and Your Life By Putting Service First.\"\nsource\n\n    Courtesy of BenBella Books\n\nThe minute our recruiters start talking to candidates, from the first phone\ncall or email through several rounds of interviews, they bring up the core\nvalues and ask behavioral-based questions to see if the candidates understand\nand align with those values. We dig right in to great customer service and\ntalk about understanding change, and being humble, and taking chances, taking\nrisks, and being ready to learn. Our hiring process is not just about the\nresumes. It's about finding out who these candidates are as human beings.\n\nWhen we get to a final decision phase, the candidates spend the day -\nsometimes multiple days - on site, getting to know the whole company. They're\ngiven tours of the campus so they can see our values in action. They join us\nfor lunches and after-work happy hours, just so we can see how they interact\nwith other employees.\n\nOnce they're hired, we put them through an extensive new-hire training (NHT)\nand onboarding process. Our onboarding is four weeks! Four weeks in which our\nnew Zapponians get a deep dive into our history, our core values, and who we\nare as a company. And that onboarding is really an extension of the hiring\nprocess. If we decide at the end of those four weeks that they're just not a\ngood fit with one or more of our core values, we let candidates know we're\ngoing to let them go; and if they themselves don't feel that they're a good\nfit for Zappos, we want them to be comfortable walking away as well. We truly\nwant our potential employees to ask themselves, \"Is this really what I want?\nDid I sign up for the right thing? Is working at Zappos really going to make\nme happy?\" And we want them to ask these questions before they're entrenched,\nbefore they wind up working for six or eight or 10 months or a year in a place\nthey really don't like, only to quit and put us back at square one with\nrefilling the position.\n\nHow do we get our new recruits to put up with all of that? We give them an\noffer to quit at the end of training and if they choose to take that offer,\nthey receive a month's pay. Is that a costly process? Yes and no. A small\npercentage of new hires does elect to quit. And we've found that it's actually\ncost effective, because we're not just hiring people. We're hiring the right\npeople. People who have a service-first mindset. People who want to be here\nbecause we fit them, too, and who, in most cases, are going to stick around\nfor the long haul \u2026 and hopefully make our company better for the hard work we\nall put in early on.\n\n_This excerpt was published with permission from BenBella Books and \"The Power\nof WOW: How to Electrify Your Work and Your Life by Leading With Service\"\n(October 2019)._\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [Book Excerpt](/tag/book-excerpt/)\n  * [contributor 2019](/tag/contributor-2019/)\n  * [HR](/tag/hr/)\n  * [Human Resources](/tag/human-resources/)\n  * [original contributor](/tag/original-contributor/)\n  * [Zappos](/tag/zappos/)\n  * [Zappos.com](/tag/zapposcom/)\n\n[Hollie Delaney, [Business Insider\nUS](http://www.businessinsider.com/?IR=T)](https://www.businessinsider.sg/author/businessinsider)\n\n#### Popular Articles\n\n  * [![](https://static.businessinsider.sg/sites/2/wordpress-popular-posts/3369975-featured-100x70.png)](https://www.businessinsider.sg/free-online-coursera-courses \"100 online courses from Coursera are $0 now through May 31 \u2014 here\u2019s a list of all the classes open for free enrollment\") [[100 online courses from Coursera are $0 now through May 31 -- here's a list of all the classes open for free enrollment](https://www.businessinsider.sg/free-online-coursera-courses \"100 online courses from Coursera are $0 now through May 31 \u2014 here\u2019s a list of all the classes open for free enrollment\")](https://www.businessinsider.sg/free-online-coursera-courses)\n\n  * [![](https://static.businessinsider.sg/sites/2/wordpress-popular-posts/3223732-featured-100x70.png)](https://www.businessinsider.sg/how-long-can-coronavirus-live-on-surfaces-how-to-disinfect-2020-3 \"The coronavirus can live on a surgical mask for 7 days, cloth for 2 days, and paper for 3 hours.

The solution is a company-wide onboarding system that\nbalances the need to deliver consistent, high-quality support and guidance to\nall employees while still being easy to administer and flexible enough to deal\nwith differences across units. Five elements are key: A commitment that every\nnew hire should be taken on an \"onboarding journey\"; a manageable number of\ndistinct \"personas\" representing broad classes of employees to which resources\ncan be customized; technology that facilitates push and pull; a standard\ntransition language and framework; and clarity about the onboarding roles and\nresponsibilities of HR, the hiring manager, teammates, and other stakeholders.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/06/Jun19_27_579256235.jpg)\nartpartner-images/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2019/06/how-to-onboard-new-hires-at-every-\nlevel?language=es)\n\nMost large companies do a good job with the basics of signing up and orienting\nnew employees, but far fewer have processes that address the biggest\nchallenges these hires face in fully integrating into their teams and coming\nup to speed in their roles. For example, in [surveys of HR\nexecutives](/2017/05/onboarding-isnt-enough), just 29% indicated they provided\nsupport for cultural familiarization, even though struggles with culture are a\nbig reason newly arrived leaders fail. This lack of onboarding follow-through\nhas major consequences for time to performance, derailment rates, and talent\nretention.\n\nWhen firms do a good job, it\u2019s often with senior hires. This makes sense to a\npoint, given the potential impact of higher-level executives, including the\ncosts of underperformance. However, as roles across organizations become more\ncomplex, the competition for talent more intense, and the consequences of poor\nonboarding better understood, more firms are taking comprehensive looks at\ntheir policies and practices in this area.\n\nFor example, when a global, multi-business organization with more than 120,000\nemployees conducted an in-depth study of how it was onboarding the 20,000 new\nemployees it was hiring each year, it found a highly fragmented and\ninconsistent approach with large variations among businesses, geographies,\nfunctions, and levels. Although the company was known as a great place to\nwork, executives worried that the inconsistencies could someday damage their\nemployer brand and hurt engagement and retention.\n\nThey decided to develop a company-wide onboarding system that balanced the\nneed to deliver consistent, high-quality support and guidance to all employees\nwhile still being easy to administer and flexible enough to deal with\ndifferences across units. The solution had to incorporate the procedural and\nlegal formalities of the \u201csigning up\u201d process, provisioning of technology,\nspace and other critical resources, orientation to the organization including\ncultural and functional training, and acceleration of the\ntransition/integration process including peer, manager, and team connection.\n\nTo meet its many different needs around the world, the organization designed a\nframework consisted of five key (but flexible) elements:\n\n**Onboarding journeys for all.** A guiding principle was that every new hire\nshould be taken on an \u201conboarding journey,\u201d from orientation, through\nintegration, and ultimately to full effectiveness. However, the length and\ndepth of the journey differed by level, with entry-level employees supported\nthe least.\n\n**A manageable number of distinct \u201cpersonas.\u201d** The organization designated a\nset of four _personas,_ representing broad classes of employees: wage earners,\nindividual contributors, people leaders, and executives. Resources were\ncustomized for each persona based on the needs and complexity of the roles.\nFor example, time-poor, experience-rich senior leaders were offered journeys\nthat had robust content but placed fewer demands on their and their managers\u2019\ntime.\n\n**Enabling technology that facilitated push and pull.** The organization\nrealized that, to support the new onboarding process with limited headcount to\nmanage it, they would need a technology solution. The platform they chose (one\nof many that now are available) pushes out customizable content at a specified\ncadence to provide just-in-time support and provides links to various\norientation and development resources for new hires to pull when needed.\n\n**A standard transition language and framework.** The organization used the\nsame planning frameworks and tools (in this case one based on _[The First 90\nDays](https://www.amazon.com/First-90-Days-Strategies-\nExpanded/dp/1422188612/)_ ) for key integration steps, including learning,\ncreating transition plans, and engaging in critical conversations.\n\n**Clarity about roles and responsibilities.** Finally, the organization\nclarified what would be expected from the new hire\u2019s manager, mentor, peers,\npredecessors, and other stakeholders. The focus was on building a support\nsystem for these employees.\n\nTo ensure long-term support and engagement, the team designing the new\nonboarding system engaged with existing team members and recent arrivals to\nidentify needs and build content to address them. For example, new hires are\nfrequently given long lists of people to connect with over their first few\nweeks on the job. Now, this process starts with a discussion between the\nincoming employee and his or her manager so the latter can share insights on\nkey stakeholders. The new hire is then given conversation guides to ensure\nthat these initial meet-and-greets  have significant depth and breadth. These\ninclude reflection/preparation exercises and action planning for follow-ups.\n\nAnother key focus was ensuring the new onboarding resources are visibly\nsupported by influential senior leaders and the HR community. The goal is to\ncreate a culture in which supporting transitions is seen as a way to\ncontribute and add value.\n\nWhile the focus of this project was on new hires, anyone taking a new position\nneeds some elements of support and guidance and similar systems can be used to\nsupport internals moves. These often happen more frequently than external\nhires, can be as or more challenging, and typically receive less support.\n\nBecause onboarding journeys also help employees to learn the skills and\nbehaviors necessary to be successful in their new roles, they can also serve\nas a cost-effective and time-sensitive alternative to more conventional\nleadership development.\n\nOrganizations can no longer ignore the needs of onboarding at all levels. By\nidentifying target populations, creating semi-customized journeys, and\nenlisting stakeholder support, they dramatically speed up the integration and\nacclimation process and set new employees up for greater success.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2019/06/110-Rose-Hollister.jpg)\n\n[Rose Hollister](/search?term=rose%20hollister&search_type=search-all) is a\nleadership consultant at [Genesis](https://www.genesisadvisers.com/).

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nGreg Furstner\n\nGreg Furstner is SVP of Human Resources at\n[SkillPath](https://skillpath.com/).\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nThe constricted state of the labor market has many human resources\nprofessionals thinking about how they will recruit and retain employees. With\nrecord low unemployment ([currently\n3.6](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000)%, the lowest in 49 years),\nwe are finding there are more job openings in some industries than unemployed\nworkers. As [10,000 baby boomers reach retirement age each\nday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/americans-retiring-increasing-\npace-145837368.html), the loss of company leaders also dampens the job\nclimate. In short, competition in the labor market is fierce.\n\nIf you are fortunate to find superstar candidates to bring on to your team,\nfirst impressions are everything to new hires. These new employees are\nsensitive to their experience with the company even before they start their\nnew jobs. After onboarding thousands of employees in my 30-year HR career,\nI\u2019ve found:\n\n\u2022 New hires expect the advertised role and culture to match their actual\nexperience.\n\n\u2022 They don\u2019t want to be overwhelmed with work or information early in their\nonboarding.\n\n\u2022 They take note of how welcomed and comfortable they are during the first\nweek.\n\n\u2022 New employees often make up their minds within a week of starting employment\nif they will stay at the company long-term.\n\n## **The Business Case For Onboarding**\n\nAn underwhelming onboarding experience gives new hires the impression that the\norganization is poorly managed and that the company didn't prepare properly\nfor their arrival. Particularly in today\u2019s tight labor market, a comprehensive\nonboarding process is expected by employees and should be required by HR\nprofessionals.\n\nSuccessful onboarding programs:\n\n\u2022 Present opportunities for co-workers and managers from all departments to\nconnect with new hires.\n\n\u2022 Help employees feel welcome and more prepared for their new roles.\n\n\u2022 Instill confidence in new employees and set the stage for them to have early\nsuccesses.\n\n\u2022 Encourage employees to stay with the companies longer, reducing the costs\nassociated with hiring, training and replacing lost revenue and employees.\n\nYour managers play a major role in ensuring the process works.\n\n## **New-Hire Support Starts Before The First Day**\n\nOnce your new hire accepts the job offer, don\u2019t go dark on your employee.\nWhether the employee starts in two days, two weeks or two months, keep in\ncontact. Share the company newsletter, and send benefits information before\nthe start date to make the first day more about the employee and less about\norientation. Also, mail a welcome kit that offers information about the\ncompany, perks and benefits, and swag like pens and notebooks. I feel strongly\nthat providing a company-branded article to new employees as early as possible\nconnects them to the organization.\n\nEngage new employees by sharing links to videos, social media posts or photos\nthat show the company\u2019s culture. Also, consider emailing a survey to find out\nmore personal information about the employee, like hobbies, favorite foods or\npreferred professional learning and development websites, and then share that\ninformation with members of the team.\n\nEncourage employees to connect with new hires on LinkedIn, so they see names\nand faces of co-workers before the start date.\n\nFinally, make sure your new employee\u2019s desk and technology are set up before\nthe first day. This includes establishing email accounts, adding software and\nproviding access to the intranet or company servers.\n\n## **What To Do On Day One**\n\nWhen your new hire arrives, meet them at the front door for a tour of the\noffice, pointing out areas like the break room, gym and restrooms.\n\nIntroduce the new hire to colleagues and team members, and schedule\nappointments to meet with key personnel in other departments as soon as\npossible.\n\nAs the manager, you\u2019ll want to discuss the employee\u2019s specific\nresponsibilities, department objectives and the structure and roles with the\ncompany. It\u2019s also important to share with employees how their positions fit\ninto the organization and how these roles contribute to the company\u2019s success.\n\nTo help new employees feel accomplished their first week, assign initial tasks\nwhile offering guidance, providing resources and answering questions. Some\nemployees may be hesitant to ask questions of their busy managers. Assign the\nemployee a buddy to answer everyday office questions, like where the mailboxes\nor supplies are located.\n\nDon\u2019t let your new employee eat lunch alone on the first day. Get to know your\nemployees better by taking them to lunch on your own or with the team.\n\n## **During The First 30 Days**\n\nFrom the first day to the last day of employment, you\u2019ll want to meet\nregularly with employees. Establish a set schedule of weekly or monthly\nmeetings to discuss current projects, ideas and any struggles employees may\nhave.\n\nEncourage your employees to ask questions and provide feedback. Find out how\nthey are fitting in, and answer any questions arise during these first 30\ndays. Continue to immerse employees in the company\u2019s culture and values. Help\nemployees understand what drives the culture and how your organization\noperates.\n\nAfter assigning and completing initial tasks, you may learn that your employee\nneeds skill-specific training. Set up a plan for technical training, as well\nas training in soft skills like communication and teamwork.\n\n## **During The First 90 Days**\n\nAt 90 days, your new hire should be settled in and tackling assignments.\nContinue to support independent work, answering questions as needed, and\nincrease the employee\u2019s responsibilities.\n\nManagers also should establish a measurable performance plan for employees and\ncreate projects that contribute to the success of these plans. Make sure\nemployees understand the metrics and how they can be achieved.\n\nAlso, encourage professional development. Set aside a budget for conferences,\nindustry associations and learning opportunities, and make employees aware.\n\n## **Keep Onboarding Fresh**\n\nAs trends and technologies change, onboarding must keep up with the times. Ask\nyour new employees for feedback, and measure their responses. Find out whether\nthe process worked, and if there are any components that need to be refined or\ntweaked.\n\nBy making new employees feel comfortable and accepted, they are more likely to\nbe engaged with the organization, productive and confident they can do their\njob well. A cohesive onboarding process is the place to start.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Greg Furstner](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2019/06/gregfurstner_avatar_1559661530-400x400.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/gregfurstner/\n\"Photo of Greg Furstner\")\n\n[Greg\nFurstner](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/gregfurstner/)\n\nGreg Furstner is SVP of Human Resources at\n[SkillPath](https://skillpath.com/).\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Greg Furstner&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: How To Involve Managers In The Employee Onboarding Process %0A Author: Greg Furstner %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2019/07/16/how-to-involve-managers-in-the-employee-onboarding-process/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

She previously held talent roles at Andreessen Horowitz and\nTwilio.\n\nEmployee onboarding isn\u2019t all desk balloons and company T-shirts \u2014 it\u2019s a\ncritical moment when new hires begin integrating into the culture and\nworkflows of their new company. So, it\u2019s no surprise that one of the most\nfrequently-asked questions among first-time founders is how to run a\nsuccessful onboarding process.\n\nIt\u2019s a delicate balance. Founders don\u2019t want to immediately throw new\nemployees into the deep end. But, at the same time, they must help recent\nhires develop an understanding of the company\u2019s history, vision, structure and\ngoals, as well as introduce them to all the tools, processes, projects and\ninformation they\u2019ll need to get started. When it's done well, employees should\nfind the process professional, rewarding and motivating.\n\n[Research shows](https://www.hrdive.com/news/why-do-28-of-employees-quit-in-\ntheir-first-90-days-poor-onboarding-practi/441139/) that 28% of turnover\nhappens during the first 90 days of employment and that structured onboarding\nprograms [increase retention](https://www.saplinghr.com/blog/10-employee-\nonboarding-statistics-you-must-know-in-2019) by 82%. In my own experience\nworking in recruiting at tech companies Twilio and AirBnb and in talent for\nventure firms Andreessen Horowitz and Lerer Hippeau, I\u2019ve seen this to be true\nfirst-hand.\n\nOnboarding looks different at each stage of a growing startup and\nresponsibilities change hands over time. Here\u2019s a breakdown of who\u2019s typically\nin charge of the process at each phase of growth in a startup\u2019s journey, as\nwell as a pro tip from a company currently operating at that stage.\n\n## 0-10 employees\n\nIn the very early days, the founder or CEO is the appropriate person to lead\nemployee onboarding. It\u2019s usually she or he that gave the employee the initial\noffer. This person should make sure that new employees have guidance regarding\nhow to find their place within the lean team. The new hire should be\nintroduced to everyone, shown how employees communicate within the company, be\ngiven the rundown on policies, shown where to sit and helped with their\ncomputer and benefits setup. Plus, they should receive a personalized, warm\nwelcome that makes them excited to be part of the brand-new venture.\n\n\u201cThe little things matter: the welcome email, the Slack announcement that it\u2019s\ntheir first day, bios including fun facts about them, the company swag on\ntheir desk, buying their favorite snack for the office and more all help to\nmake them feel welcomed, which helps support a successful onboarding process,\u201d\nsays Florent Peyre, co-founder of [Small Door](https://www.smalldoorvet.com/),\na tech-enabled veterinary practice.\n\n## 10-50 employees\n\nAt this stage, a startup is adding real headcount and its leadership team\nshould be thinking about hiring its first dedicated HR or People person. After\nthe company brings on a recruiter or HR manager, she or he can take over the\nbulk of the onboarding responsibilities, which should begin before new\nstaffers\u2019 official start dates.\n\n\u201cOne typical mistake is thinking that onboarding starts on someone\u2019s first\nday,\u201d says Nora Apsel, co-founder of online mortgage broker\n[Morty](https://www.morty.com/). \u201cIn the week prior to starting, we send new\nteammates an onboarding document customized to their role which includes\neverything from resources on the finance and mortgage industry to the services\nthat we use at Morty, what their first week will look like and who on the team\nthey\u2019ll be working with.\u201d\n\n## 50-100 employees\n\nOnce a company starts approaching 100 employees, its HR leader will likely\nneed additional support. That\u2019s when it\u2019s time to make a second HR hire--\ntypically an HR assistant or coordinator. She or he will handle administrative\ntasks such as managing the HRIS (Human Resource Information System), filing\npaperwork, helping run onboarding for all new hires and assisting with\nrecruiting efforts, such as posting open roles.\n\n![](https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447508128842484&ev=PageView&noscript=1)\n\n"}, {"item": "Paychex - Consenus Indicates Potential 15.1% Upside - DirectorsTalk

The traditional model of onboarding is at fault. Colleen Blake\ndiscusses how a tailored, campaign-style onboarding can improve retention.**_\n\nHR leaders tell us that they\u2019re experiencing a strange phenomenon in this\nrecord low unemployment environment: new hires are \u201cghosting\u201d them. They sign\ntheir offer letters but don\u2019t show up for work a few weeks later and cut off\nall communication. In the interim, they take different jobs without telling\ntheir would-be employer.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d83481487bf0.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nGhosting is a sign that employees have enormous leverage in the current job\nmarket. But it also points to systemic problems with onboarding and retention\nthat remained unsolved.\n\nWe\u2019ve long known that the first three months of a job are critical to\nretention. Jobvite\u2019s [2018 Job Seeker Nation\nStudy](https://www.jobvite.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2018/04/2018_Job_Seeker_Nation_Study.pdf) found that 30\npercent of job seekers have left a job within 90 days of starting. A study by\nthe recruitment firm Robert Half [finds a similar\n](https://www.roberthalf.co.uk/press/nine-10-new-hires-would-leave-job-fails-\nmeet-expectations-within-first-month)pattern: 91 percent of candidates are\nwilling to leave a job in the first month if it doesn\u2019t match their\nexpectations. Notably, 36 percent say that a lack of proper onboarding \u2014 a\ncommon denominator in every job \u2014 would be grounds to quit.\n\nAlso Read: [HR\u2019s Guide to a Gen Z\nWorkforce](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/hrs-\nguide-to-a-gen-z-workforce/)  \n  \nWhen our CEO, Keith Kitani, took his first professional job in 1985,\n\u201conboarding\u201d was four hours of reading a bone-dry employee handbook. Little\nhas changed since then. We believe HR departments struggle with ghosting and\nthe first 90 days because they run onboarding as an impersonal, singular\nevent. To improve retention, HR departments need to introduce a tailored,\ncampaign-style onboarding that helps new hires develop a sense of\nproductivity, purpose and belonging at work.\n\nThis Time it\u2019s Personal\n\nHere\u2019s a fair question: Why didn\u2019t more people ghost or churn during\nonboarding back in 1985, when Keith was stuck in a windowless room reading a\npaper manual?\n\nDigital culture has changed expectations. People steeped in the online\nconsumer world have become used to an optimal, personalized option for every\naspect of their life, and jobs are no exception. If candidates look for a\ntailored job, they\u2019ll expect a tailored experience at the job, too.\n\nHow tailored are we talking? A global company could hire new people every week\nin multiple countries, with different languages, benefits packages, and work\nregulations. Not only that, these new hires could be at different age and\nexperience levels, in diverse roles that require different IT systems and work\nprocesses.\n\nIf you have new people starting every Monday in 10 countries in five roles,\nyou\u2019re looking at 50 unique experiences. Multiply that by 13 starting points\nin a 90-day window, which means you must tailor 650 onboardings at once.\n\nMost companies don\u2019t have the technology to deal with that level of variation,\nso they come up with one or two onboarding tracks. The result is that new\nhires have to wade through a lot of information that might be irrelevant to\nthem, leaving a bad first impression and a feeling of disorientation, no pun\nintended.\n\nEvery onboarding needs to be personalized by start date, location, language,\njob role, and age to overcome this problem.\n\nThe Campaign  \n  \nIn addition to introducing a tailored experience, onboarding needs to be\ndelivered similar to a campaign, dripped over time. Here\u2019s what that would\nlook like:\n\n## 1\\. Ghosting Prevention\n\nThe first drip appears as soon as a new hire signs the offer. During this\nfragile wait time, when some new hires might experience a little buyer\u2019s\nremorse, it\u2019s a good idea to deliver relevant, inspiring content to get them\nexcited about Day One and to hit the ground running when they arrive. This\ncould be a personalized welcome email with a self-guided tour, links to videos\nabout the culture and customers or recent news coverage. Sending \u201cswag\u201d bags\nwith backpacks, pens, hoodies, etc. makes it harder to ghost your company\nbefore the first day.\n\nBetter yet, ask their immediate coworkers, mentor or manager to say \u201cHi.\u201d\nIntroductions on LinkedIn, friendly emails or coffee near the office could go\na long way toward preventing potential ghosting.\n\n## 2\\. Day One \u2013 Making New Hires Productive\n\nEveryone showed up (hopefully). Part of the onboarding campaign could be a\nquick schedule and what to expect in each session. Getting the basics out of\nthe way in an efficient manner makes new hires feel like they can actually\nstart producing, instead of feeling like the newbie all day long.\n\n## 3\\. People, Process, and Systems\n\nFrom day one to 90, new hires are filled with questions about the people,\nsystems, and processes critical to their job. Your mission is to fill the gaps\nin a manageable, ongoing way. What if your onboarding campaign contained this\ninformation is easy to digest format that enables new hires to hit the ground\nrunning? The quicker they can dive into meaningful work, the less likely\nthey\u2019ll start looking for their next opportunity.\n\n## 4\\. Culture\n\nIn addition to wanting responsibility and competency, people want a sense of\nbelonging. It\u2019s important to include them in team meetings and customer\nbriefings where they can observe coworkers in action and ask questions. That\u2019s\nhow people absorb the culture and learn how to belong. And expressly\narticulating your company\u2019s mission, values and cultural norms in your\nonboarding campaign also prepares new hires to become a member of the team.\n\nThe old model of onboarding is probably scaring away your talent and needs an\nupgrade. Onboarding shapes how new hires picture their future. If onboarding\nis irrelevant, boring and unhelpful, that\u2019s how employees will think of your\ncompany (if they haven\u2019t already ghosted you).\n\nConversely, if onboarding is a tailored campaign designed to create a sense of\nproductivity, purpose, and belonging, those first 90 days will increase\nretention. It will make all that effort you put into attracting and recruiting\ngreat people worth it.\n\nAlso Read: [Your Company\u2019s Talent Strategy Shouldn\u2019t Stop at the Offer\nLetter](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/your-\ncompanys-talent-strategy-shouldnt-stop-at-the-offer-letter/)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fto-stop-the-ghosting-epidemic-upgrade-your-\nonboarding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=To+Stop+the+Ghosting+Epidemic%2C+Upgrade+Your+Onboarding\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=To+Stop+the+Ghosting+Epidemic%2C+Upgrade+Your+Onboarding&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fto-stop-the-ghosting-epidemic-upgrade-your-\nonboarding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fto-stop-the-ghosting-epidemic-upgrade-your-\nonboarding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fto-stop-the-ghosting-epidemic-upgrade-your-\nonboarding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=To Stop the Ghosting Epidemic, Upgrade Your\nOnboarding&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Frecruitment-\nonboarding%2Fto-stop-the-ghosting-epidemic-upgrade-your-\nonboarding%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Recruitment & Onboarding ](/category/recruitment-\nonboarding/ \"Recruitment & Onboarding\")\n\n  * [ ![10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/banner_10_best_onboarding_experience_strategies_for_your_2020_hires_5dd3c26040063.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-experience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 10 Best Onboarding Experience Strategies for Your 2020 Hires\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/onboarding-\nexperience-strategies-and-examples/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nThe onboarding experience you offer makes the difference between a successful\nhire and a lost investment.
