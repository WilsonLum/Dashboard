In a recent field survey1 of healthcare Chief Experience\nOfficers (CXOs), about a third\n[indicated](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/whitepapers/2020-employee-care-report) they were responsible for\nOrganizational Culture, a quarter oversaw both Employee and Patient\nExperience, yet less than 12% had any sort of formal relationship with Human\nResources.\n\nCulture, Team Member Experience (TX) and Human Resources (HR) are imperative\nto a positive Patient Experience. In order to be effective, the CXO should\nhave a clearly formalized relationship with the CHRO.\n\n# Importance of Experience\n\n## Building the Foundation\n\nTeam member engagement is a foundational pillar, upon which rest several\norganizational objectives, irrespective of the industry and mission of the\norganization. It is even more relevant in industries such as healthcare, where\nan error can result in multiple deaths. The relevance gains momentum in times\nwhere healthcare is [experiencing high\nburnout](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/articles/employee-burnout-in-2020) with suicide rates double that\nof other industries, and a time where employers are competing for skills, the\nnumbers retiring exceed those entering the workforce and an industry turnover\nof about 20% 2. This significance grows exponentially when we place this\nagainst the backdrop of skyrocketing costs of healthcare in the US3, uncertain\nfederal funding programs and increasing competition from non-traditional\nplayers 4.\n\nTeam member engagement directly impacts Patient Experience (PX) and Safety\noutcomes. The top quartile of engaged healthcare teams exhibit 70% lower\nsafety incidents than those in the bottom quartile 5. A 5-point change in\nEngagement score impacts 1% profitability 6.\n\nIn my second week as the Chief Experience Officer (CXO) at Parkland, Judy\nHerrington, Vice President of Nursing made it very clear to me that the\n\"plate\" of the leader on the frontlines overflows with priorities marked\nurgent and more urgent, with new initiatives added daily, and few taken off.\nWe conduct various surveys, and each survey ends up producing another set of\n\"action items\". These action items are then pushed down from the C-Suite\nthrough the chain of command to the front-line leader. When the front-line\nleader attempts to implement, they can receive resistance from the team\nmembers as they are already busy. This results in two phenomenon: the burnout\nof the front line leader who is under pressure from above and below, and\ndisengagement of the frontline team. The engine of senior leadership driving\nfor results is pushing the train of the many hierarchical leaders down the\ntrack, where the last coach, the front-line team member, is against the blocks\nat the end of the track. Further pushing from leaders only leads to the train\nbuckling - more misalignment, turnover, cost over runs and safety issues.\n\nWhile it seems logical that Team member Experience and Patient Experience\nshould be aligned, yet, in the survey of CXOs in the US Healthcare Industry1,\nonly 24% of the CXOs indicated ownership of Team member Experience.\nInterestingly, another 28% suggested they would be more effective in their\nrole if Team member Experience was included in their scope. Furthermore, 36%\nof the CXOs indicated they were responsible for Organizational Culture while\nan additional 28% suggested they would be more effective if this was included\nin their scope.\n\nTX and PX initiatives can be, or in fact, _should_ be actioned together.\nSafety & Quality initiatives need to be clinician led to ensure buy in and\nsustainability, while being closely coordinated with TX & PX. Various\npermutations of this model are being used in various healthcare systems and\nare organization and leader dependent. While that is the case, 8% of the CXOs\nsurveyed were responsible for Safety & Quality, half of whom were actively\nattempting to divest themselves of that function.\n\nAligning TX and PX is also logical from a Financial perspective - for\nreimbursement and for customer retention and acquisition.\n\nExamining the [financial logic](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/articles/employee-experience-the-business-case) from a\nreimbursement perspective: TX impacts Communication of Nurses which is a key\ndriver for \"Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems\"\n(HCHAPs) scores. TX also impacts safety outcomes. HCAHPs, and safety outcomes\nare utilized in the Value Based Purchasing (VBP) model to calculate\nreimbursement for Medicare services provided by the organization. For the sake\nof simplicity, I am only demonstrating HCAHPs in the diagram below:\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/vishal_image_1.jpg)\n\nCustomer retention and acquisition are also impacted by TX. From a marketing\nperspective, TX impacts the experience of the Patient and their family, and\nthis impacts the customer churn. Positive team member experiences will\ndecrease the Cost of Customer Acquisition (COCA) and the Cost of Customer\nRetention (COCR) substantially, thus making the financial case again for\naligning TX and PX.\n\nVolunteer Services also play a major role by not only providing some man hours\nat no cost, but more importantly, by engaging the community. They are an\ninformal and more effective means of communicating the image, mission, vision\nand values of the organization into the community from first hand experiences.\nThis is heightened in the age of social media and impacts COCA and COCR.\nActive volunteers are crucial for effective Patient Family Advisory Councils\n(PFACs) and provide valuable insights from a Voice of the Consumer (VOC)\nperspective. They are also excellent ambassadors to patients and their\nfamilies, in allaying any fears as a true third party that may have\nexperienced or seen a positive outcome of a similar procedure at the\norganization. While 28% of the CXOs surveyed managed volunteer services,\nanother 20% were working on bringing them into the experience fold to maximize\nsuch opportunities.\n\nThe dynamics of the factors impacting Team member & Patient Experience that\nare influenced by HR and Culture of the Organization are examined in the\ncontext of the data from Parkland (inclusive of both Parkland staff and UT\nSouthwestern providers primarily assigned to Parkland). The top factors were:\n\n  * Teamwork, Recognition, Leadership cares about \"me\", and factors impacting burnout (time to do my job (staffing), meaningful feedback, compensation, recognition, influence over decisions) \n\nThe interplay of these variables, when layered on top of the financial model\ndiscussed earlier, can be represented in the diagram as below:\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/vishal_image_2.jpg)\n\n\n\nThe system dynamics model above depicts that the primary drivers for HCAHPS\nare Team member Engagement, Communication with Nursing and Trust in Provider.\nIf we examine Patient's Trust in Provider (PTP), it is dependent upon Time\nspent with provider (staffing) and provider Burnout, both of which lead us\nback to other variables leading to HR and Culture. Other variables are mapped\nin a similar manner. Note the number of variables that are in the purview of\nthe HR team.\n\nWhile other support initiatives are required, such as those in the realm of\nProcess Improvement and Technology, to affect a meaningful change in TX & PX\nmetrics; HR is the key.\n\n> REPORT:  [The Interesction of Employee Engagement and Business\n> Success](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/reports/the-\n> intersection-of-employee-engagement-and-business-success)\n\nWhen we set up the CXO role at Parkland, our CEO, Dr. Fred Cerise and our then\nChief Talent Officer,\n\nDr. Jim Dunn saw in their wisdom the logic of placing both Team member and\nPatient Experience under the CXO. It is important to note that while we have\nhad leadership changes at Parkland, this structure has not changed and is now\nbeing reinforced even further by our current CTO, Felicia Miller. Leveraging\nthis strategy continuously over the past three years has helped achieve the\nfollowing metrics:\n\n  * HCAHPS scores for the Quarter ending December 2019 saw us in the 90th percentile for the National Database and in the 93rd percentile for University Health Systems Consortium. (Moving from the 79th and 75th percentiles respectively since Sep 2017).\n  * We achieved our Annual HCAHPS 2019 target of 89.3, a statistically significant improvement.\n  * Mean Employee Engagement score rose by 17 percentile ranks; nearly 6% over three years.\n  * Number of Tier 1 leaders rose from 32 to 122 over three years.\n  * Turnover decreased from 18.5% to 15.1% in 2018, representing savings of $9 million and is annualized at 14.8 % for 2019.\n  * Employee engagement survey participation grew from a flat 59% in 2014 and 2016 to 79% in 2017 and 88% in 2018. \n\nThe theory of combining TX and PX, its practical application at Parkland and\nresultant outcomes - all point to the benefits of having TX & PX under one\nleader, the Chief Experience Officer.\n\n\n\n**References**\n\n  1. \"CXO Structure Survey\", Vishal Bhalla, February 2020.

Shutterstock\n\n**As UK employee engagement and productivity levels remain stubbornly low,\nStuart Hearn explains why improving engagement levels is a job for the whole\nbusiness, not just HR.**\n\nHR leaders are all too familiar with the yearly engagement survey. But\nengagement surveys which have accurate and useful results are more of a\nnovelty.\n\nIncreasingly, HR understands that such surveys only reflect how an employee is\nfeeling in that current moment. They aren\u2019t an accurate representation of what\nengagement has been like throughout the whole year.\n\nSenior managers know they want high employee engagement, but when the surveys\nhave negative responses, businesses react with engagement initiatives \u2013 which\nmay or may not do the trick. When they don\u2019t, it\u2019s usually HR who are held\nresponsible.\n\nHR should act as facilitators by supporting staff and providing them with the\nappropriate tools to reflect on, measure and boost their own engagement\u201d\n\nHR, traditionally, have been the gatekeepers of this rather uninspiring\nprocess. In reality, employee engagement shouldn\u2019t solely be the\nresponsibility of HR \u2013 it should be everyone\u2019s.\n\nFor employee engagement to be high, you need the right conditions. Senior\nleaders are responsible for setting out the culture, which means they need to\ncreate a culture in which engagement is a priority. Managers work directly\nwith employees and should ensure their employees are immersed in their work.\nEmployees need to be open and honest about how engaged they are with their\nmanagers. And HR? HR should act as facilitators by supporting staff and\nproviding them with the appropriate tools to reflect on, measure and boost\ntheir own engagement.\n\n## Senior leaders must drive the cultural shift\n\nStudies have shown that a good company culture can increase revenue. For\nexample, one study which looked at 200 companies revealed that those with\n_[performance-enhancing cultures had, on average, a 682% revenue\ngrowth](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkotter/2011/02/10/does-corporate-\nculture-drive-financial-performance/#69c1205a7e9e)_ compared to 166% in\ncompanies that didn\u2019t.\n\nSenior leaders set the tone for the culture of an organisation, and to make\nsure it\u2019s one in which engagement can thrive, there are a few things they must\ndo:\n\n## Ongoing engagement\n\nEmployee engagement isn\u2019t a one-time thing. We can\u2019t expect a snapshot of\nsomeone\u2019s engagement to last for the entire year. If engagement is measured\nannually, it risks being skewed by outlier data. People may be genuinely\nengaged and committed to their work but suffering from a stinking cold on\nsurvey day. They might have had a horrible commute, or a family bereavement,\nor too many glasses of wine the night before. Measuring engagement frequently\nand regularly will mitigate this, as long as it\u2019s done in a low-touch way that\ndoesn\u2019t pull people out of the flow of work.\n\n## Practise what you preach\n\nMost people in an organisation look up to senior leadership for guidance.\nLeaders need to set an example. They need to demonstrate that engagement is\nimportant to them by acting on the insights they get. Perhaps most\nimportantly, they need to base those actions in work, and work outcomes. If\nthe result of an engagement initiative is a coffee machine or a yoga class,\nthat may make people happier in the short term, but it won\u2019t move the needle\nin a lasting way.\n\n## Direct managers must understand and motivate their employees\n\nAccording to Gallup, managers account for over 70% of the variance in employee\nengagement. Employees with highly engaged managers are 59% more likely to be\nengaged than employees supervised by actively disengaged managers. Managers\nplay an integral role in ensuring employee engagement because they have a\ncloser relationship with employees than senior leaders and HR. They understand\ntheir employees\u2019 day-to-day work and should have some responsibility in\nensuring that they feel motivated. It\u2019s important for managers to create an\nenvironment in which employees can openly discuss their work and how they are\nfeeling.\n\nOne way in which managers could do this is by taking a _[coaching\napproach](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231581/five-ways-improve-employee-\nengagement.aspx)_ to understand each employee\u2019s strengths and help them use\nthose in their role. According to _[Gallup](https://hbr.org/2015/04/what-\ngreat-managers-do-to-engage-employees)_ , employees who feel their manager is\ninvested in them as people are more likely to be engaged. Each person is\ndifferent, with different challenges. Recognising your employees\u2019\ncontributions and seeking out their opinions and ideas can help them feel\nempowered and engaged.\n\nPerformance management is also linked to engagement. Employees with _[managers\nwho excel at performance management](https://hbr.org/2015/04/what-great-\nmanagers-do-to-engage-employees)_ activities are more engaged than employees\nwhose managers struggle with these tasks. If managers talk to their employees,\nand provide clarity on goals and objectives, they\u2019re already creating the\nenvironment for work engagement.\n\n## Employees must be responsible for their own engagement\n\nEmployees play a critical role in their own engagement. It\u2019s vital that they\nreflect on their own state of mind \u2013 and how it applies to their work \u2013 and\nuse that to prompt discussion with their manager. This is work engagement at\nits purest: the positive loop whereby the employee and manager find ways to\nnavigate obstacles and take advantage of opportunities. It\u2019s _[performance\nmanagement feeding engagement](https://resources.clearreview.com/powering-\nperformance-engagement-ebook)_.\n\nA study by _[Amabile and Kramer](https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-\nwins)_ underlines this: it found that people feel motivated by what they\ndescribe as a \u201cprogress-loop.\u201d When we make progress towards something that\nmatters to us, we feel motivated to continue \u2013 causing further progress.\n\nFinally, creating a space for \u201cflow\u201d \u2013 a term coined by psychologist _[Mihaly\nCsikzsentmihalyi](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224927532_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience)_\n\u2013 is a state in which a person is so completely immersed in an activity that\nthey lose a sense of time and forget about demands that aren\u2019t related to the\ncurrent task. These can include tasks that are meaningful to you and require\nyour full concentration \u2013 allowing you to feel in control and invigorated.\n\n## HR should hold everyone accountable\n\nHR plays an essential role in ensuring that engagement initiatives run\nsmoothly. A key part should be to support managers and employees with the\nright tools and learning opportunities. HR should hold managers accountable\nfor ensuring that engagement initiatives are followed through. But also, they\nneed to ensure that senior leaders and managers are engaged at work, otherwise\nthis could have a knock down effect on employees. According to research by\nTowards Maturity, three in five L&D leaders said one of the biggest barriers\nto success for engagement initiatives was management\u2019s engagement.\n\nHowever, there are tools that can help HR capture more accurate information\nabout the state of play in an organisation. It\u2019s possible to identify which\nmanagers or employees aren\u2019t having regular conversations or may be struggling\nto create effective goals. You can also view engagement data at a team or\nmacro-level, which can guide the development of EAPs or wellness initiatives.\nMost importantly, it puts engagement in the context of performance, ensuring\nthat employee engagement is grounded in work outcomes. The role of the manager\nand their relationship with the employee is crucial here. HR doesn\u2019t need to\nbe the engagement police: they should be enablers of business value, with\nengagement as one of the metrics they have to play with.\n\n## Latest HR job opportunities on Personnel Today\n\n  \n[**Browse more human resources\njobs**](https://jobs.personneltoday.com/landingpage/1401583260/human-\nresources-jobs/)\n\n![Stuart Hearn](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2020/03/Stuart-Hearn.jpg)\n\n#### About Stuart Hearn\n\nStuart Hearn is founder and CEO of [Clear\nReview](https://www.clearreview.com/)\n\n[ View all posts by Stuart Hearn ->\n](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/author/stuarthearn/)\n\n[Previous Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/russell-group-graduates-\nless-likely-to-need-work-experience-to-get-a-job/)\n\n[Next Article](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/how-banks-can-balance-\nstability-and-innovation/)\n\n##### No comments yet.\n\n### Leave a Reply [Click here to cancel reply.](/hr/responsibility-for-\nemployee-engagement-hr/#respond)\n\nComment\n\nName (required)\n\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\n\nWebsite\n\n### Related posts:\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2019/06/peer-\nto-peer-tipping.jpg)What risks arise from employee 'tipping'\napps?](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/what-risks-arise-from-employee-\ntipping-apps/ \"What risks arise from employee \u2018tipping\u2019 apps?\")\n\nPeer-to-peer \"tipping\" schemes are rising in popularity in the workplace, but\nthese \"recognise and reward\" programmes should come with a...\n\n[ ![](https://www.personneltoday.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/sites/8/2019/06/clocking-in-635.jpg)When does keeping tabs on\nworking time overstep the line?](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/when-does-\nkeeping-tabs-on-working-time-overstep-the-line/ \"When does keeping tabs on\nworking time overstep the line?\")\n\nA recent ECJ case means employers will need to more closely track employee\ntime at work.

In many developed\ncountries, productivity is stagnating. But the answer to one could be the\nanswer to the other as long as we think about engagement in the right way and\nwith the right tech, writes Stuart Hearn, CEO of Clear Review._**\n\nThe UK isn\u2019t alone in having a productivity problem. A brief look at the\nBureau of Labor Statistics shows that the US has its challenges, too,\n[particularly in some sectors](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/prin.nr0.htm).\nBut the UK is racing to find a new place in world trade before its regulatory\nexit from the European Union at the end of 2020. The stakes are high, and the\nrhetoric is persuasive. Only a couple of years ago, the Bank of England\u2019s\nchief economist Andy Haldane was widely quoted as saying that the average\nFrench worker accomplishes by Thursday lunchtime what it takes a British\nworker all week to do. It was a dramatic - perhaps even hyperbolic -\npronouncement, but it raised an important issue.\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834cadce393.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nWhy are so many developed economies struggling with\n[productivity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/how-employee-engagement-leads-to-a-more-productive-workforce/)? We\nwork fewer hours now, on average, but gradually decreasing hours is a global\ntrend. The key may lie in a value that has remained consistent (and\nconsistently stagnant) for years: employee engagement. The UK has one of the\nlowest rankings for employee engagement in the world: just 11% of employees\nclaim to be highly engaged at work. Engagement, in truth, is an issue\nthroughout western Europe and Asia. Even the US and Canada, who typically come\nat or near the top of engagement measures, report that only around 30% of\nemployees are highly engaged. In the most engaged countries in the world, 70%\nof employees are actively disengaged from (or indifferent to) their jobs.\n\nWhy is this important? Because analysts from Gallup to Gartner draw a clear\nline between engagement, productivity, and profitability. Organizations with\nhighly engaged employees make more money, have happier customers, and deliver\nmore profit. A [Gallup\nreport](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/162953/tackle-employees-\nstagnating-engagement.aspx) from 2013 estimated that disengaged US employees\ncost the economy between $450 billion and $550 billion a year in lost\n[productivity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/10-ways-\nhr-managers-can-boost-workplace-productivity/). Should we just accept that\nthese numbers are difficult to move? Should we continue to apply the patchwork\nquilt of solutions that have served us so poorly in the past: more remote\nworking, more wellbeing initiatives, a friendlier working environment? All of\nthese things are good in and of themselves, but do they move the needle?\n\n## **A Tested Measure of Work Engagement**\n\nMost references to employee engagement start and end with the annual\nengagement survey. Whether they\u2019re a brief dozen questions or an indigestible\nbarium meal of 50 or more, they tend to suffer from the same problem: action.\nIn a recent _Forbes_ poll, 58% of HR directors admitted that they took no\nmeaningful response from engagement data. And this has a vital bearing on our\nproductivity issue. In a meta-analysis of 90 engagement studies by Wilmar\nSchaufeli at the University of Utrecht, **work engagement** has proved to be a\nmore reliable predictor of both task and team performance than any other\nsingle factor. It\u2019s more important than loyalty. It\u2019s more important, even\nthan inspirational leadership.\n\nSchaufeli and his colleagues are the creators of the Utrecht Work Engagement\nScale - the most widely used and tested model for work engagement. Their\nthinking is to measure engagement in a way that refers directly to the\nperson\u2019s work. This is crucial. eNPS, for example, measures loyalty. Loyalty\nis important, but it doesn\u2019t have as secure a connection with performance.\nWhy? Because our experience of our working lives is grounded in the work we\ndo, not the trappings of being at work. If you want to make someone more\nengaged, you need to make their actual work better, not book them a massage,\nor buy a bean-to-cup coffee machine.\n\n## **How Engagement Can Influence Performance**\n\nAstute readers will have spotted a missing piece here. If genuine engagement\ncan only be found in the experience of doing work, the insights from\nengagement surveys need to be tied back into work outcomes. This is where\nengagement needs to work in concert with performance management. Historically,\nthese disciplines have been measured separately. There are anonymity issues to\novercome - engagement surveys can only really guarantee candor by offering\nanonymity - which makes it challenging to feed specific results back into the\nsystem and create key actions for individuals.\n\nThe solution is to reflect an employee\u2019s answers at them in real-time. Ask the\nemployee the right questions with the right cadence, then use those answers to\ngive the employee a springboard for a discussion with their manager. This has\ntwo key advantages. Firstly, it guarantees anonymity at an individual level;\nand secondly, it places the responsibility for engagement where it belongs -\nwithin the [employee-manager\nrelationship](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/ai-in-hr/how-ai-is-\nimproving-the-employee-manager-relationship/). HR should not be held\nresponsible for the engagement of the team. Their role should be to gather the\ninsight at a macro-level for discussion with senior leaders and managers. The\nactual process of boosting engagement - the details of resources,\nrelationships, and means that employees need to do their jobs better - sits\nwithin the team.\n\n**Learn More:[The Future of Employee Engagement: Supporting the Whole\nWorker](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/the-\nfuture-of-employee-engagement/)**\n\n## **A Continuous Approach to Engagement**\n\nThere is a final piece to the puzzle. The frequency with which you measure\npeople\u2019s engagement is crucial. Just like proper performance management,\nengagement needs to be done continuously.\n\nTo take an example: if your engagement surveys are conducted annually, you\nrisk your results being skewed by the challenges of everyday life. You don\u2019t\nwant your engagement results to be affected by a sick child or a terrible\nmorning commute. But you very much do want to understand problems in a timely\nway, so you have the chance to take action. One of the main reasons\norganizations are dispensing with annual appraisals is because performance\nmanagement needs to be grounded in what\u2019s happening _now_ , not what happened\nnine months ago. If you take a regular view of engagement by measuring it\nevery month rather than every year, you can feed those results into a\nperformance conversation before an issue has a chance to fester.\n\nYou can\u2019t inflict a hundred-question survey on your people every month, so\nthis approach has implications for the format of the study itself. Once again,\nthe principles of proper performance management apply here. Just as a check-in\nconversation slims down the appraisal format - breaking an hour- or days-long\nprocess into bite-size chunks that happen throughout the year - so it\u2019s\nentirely possible to create a lighter, more straightforward engagement check\nthat doesn\u2019t pull people out of the flow of work.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Increase Employee Engagement through Modern\nITSM](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-to-\nincrease-employee-engagement-through-modern-itsm/)**\n\n## **The Path to High Performance**\n\nThe aim of all this is to create a meaningful dialogue between manager and\nemployee. It\u2019s a facet of [performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/impacts-on-employee-engagement-with-performance-management/). We\nneed to help employees to be more aware of their energy, their motivations,\nand their sense of purpose so that this information can fuel their\ndevelopment. Yes, someone can be upset for a few days because their car was\nstolen. But that shouldn\u2019t affect their work engagement. What does affect\ntheir work engagement is a complicated professional relationship, or\npersistently buggy software or an outdated process. And these are things we\ncan fix. These are the things\n[managers](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/leadership-\nsuccession/managers-do-things-right-leaders-do-the-right-thing/) can move the\nneedle on. We can resolve those challenges or find those opportunities to\n[upskill](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/skills-of-the-future-10-skills-youll-need-to-thrive-in-2020/). If we can\ncreate that virtuous circle - and the technology already exists to capture\nthis information and automate the prompts we need to take action - then we\u2019ll\nbegin to see those engagement numbers change. And the bottom line will change\nalong with them.\n\n_**Are you following any best practices to improve employee productivity?

For example, which, if any, benefits\nshould get cut first, whether sacrifices are being fairly distributed and if\nadjustments need to be made to any new ways of working.\n\n\"Employee experience is one of the most important business considerations\nduring tough times, when an organisation's commitment to its employees is laid\nbare,\" explains Didier Elzinga, CEO and co-founder, Culture Amp. \"It's crucial\nthat leaders listen to the concerns of their employees at this time. How they\ndecide to face these moments of trauma will set the behaviour patterns for the\nfuture so it's important to do the best thing for employees now and over the\ncoming days, weeks and months.\"\n\nCulture Amp has launched two survey templates addressing areas such as company\nconfidence, communication and awareness, business continuity, well-being and\nhealth.\n\n**The Emergency Response - COVID-19 Pulse Survey** is designed specifically\nfor the current situation and is intended to be an ongoing shorter survey to\ncheck-in with employees regularly (eg, weekly) and track trends over time.\n\n**The Emergency Response - Extended Survey Template** is intended to gain a\nfull understanding of how employees feel about any fast-changing and / or\nemergency situation such as the COVID-19 pandemic. It contains additional\nquestions for most factors including leadership, role enablement and\ncommunication, providing a wider pull of questions to select from.\n\nThe survey templates can be found at Culture Amp's Community hub -\n<https://www.culturefirst.com/resilience> \\- where there are also curated and\ncrowdsourced COVID-19 resources to support HR teams through testing times.\n\nENDS\n\n**About Culture Amp**  \nCulture Amp is the leading People & Culture Platform helping companies take\naction to improve employee engagement, retention and performance.

Nearly half (48%) of employers require\nemployees to use sick leave first, then vacation leave and finally potential\nPTO for coronavirus absences.\n\nTwenty percent of organisations increased PTO for individuals who are sick\nand/or caring for a sick family member; 18% of organisations have granted\nadditional PTO for parents who are caring for children whose schools are\nclosed.\n\nSeventy percent of organisations report that the main cost-cutting measure\nthey plan to use is more effective use of technology. Nearly half of\norganisations plan to freeze new hiring.\n\nA greater percentage of organisations plan to reduce work for external\npartners rather than employees -- one-fifth of organisations plan to stop or\nlimit consultant spend and/or reduce the number of contract workers. Only 10%\nof employers plan to reduce working hours, and just 6% report asking employees\nto take unpaid leave.\n\nTo manage remote talent during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gartner recommends HR\nleaders do the following:\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\n  * **Provide direction, confidence and resilience.** Employees are relying on leaders at all levels of the business to take action and set the tone. Communications from senior business leaders to managers should prioritise associate health and business sustainability. Communicate regularly with employees, maintaining an open dialog. Gartner's survey found that 56% of organisations have communicated a plan of action to employees in the event the COVID-19 outbreak.\n  * **Contextualise coronavirus for the organisation.** Leaders should be a trusted source for accurate and up-to-date information on coronavirus and how it is impacting the organisation. Avoid sharing information from social media; leverage trusted resources such as the World Health Organisation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Contextualise information and data as much as possible so that it specifically relates to the organisation.\n  * **Encourage intentional peer-to-peer interactions.** With reduced or no face time in the office, employees should maintain regular professional and personal interactions with their peers. Gartner's survey found that 40% of organisations have set up additional virtual check-ins for employees with managers and 32% of organisations have introduced new tools for virtual meetings. HR leaders should encourage employees to leverage communication platforms they already use, either at work or in their personal lives, to create new ways to work together. \n  * **Establish team guidelines.** Remote work looks different for each employee depending on their needs and those of their families. With unprecedented school closures, many employees must take on a double role as they support their children and families throughout the workday. Organisations can meet employees' needs by empowering teams to adapt to their conflicting time demands. For instance, teams can set \"core team times\" when all team members are available to collaborate.\n  * **Provide flexibility for employees ' remote work needs**. When preparing for employees' eventual return to the office, empower employees to make choices best suited for their needs and comfort levels. Where possible, allow employees to decide when to return to the office. Enable essential employees whose work requires them to return to the office to choose the hours that work best for them to return to avoid peak commute times.\n\n### Related stories\n\n  * ['Being

resources professionals search for best practices online.\nWe\u2019ve listed some of this quarter\u2019s most frequently asked social HR questions\nfrom across the internet and compiled the answers here for you.\n\n## What are the best uses for social media in the workplace?\n\nCompanies can have their HR departments use social media to improve everyday\nfunctions in the workplace. With the right platforms, workers can stay on top\nof tasks, effectively communicate with team members and cut down the number of\nemails sent. [Research from\nMcKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-\ntelecommunications/our-insights/the-social-economy) shows social media\nplatforms could increase productivity by up to 25% by substituting emails for\nsocial media communications.\n\nIn addition, social HR can provide a platform for coworkers to praise their\npeers. When employees feel appreciated, turnover drops, and productivity and\nsatisfaction increase.\n\nEncouraging high-performing employees to share accomplishments, work\nexperiences and successful projects is an important step for them to find\nmeaning in their work. By taking ownership of their efforts, [team members can\nbecome highly engaged at work while boosting the organization\u2019s\nbrand.](https://thenextweb.com/podium/2019/07/11/why-social-media-is-key-to-\nkeeping-employees-engaged-at-work/) LinkedIn posts that highlight a worker\u2019s\nproject can be shared and viewed by clients, potential job candidates and\nother important audiences.\n\n##\n\n## How can organizations integrate social media into their workflows?\n\nTo get workers involved in your organization\u2019s social HR efforts, make sure\nall team members are granted access and education. Allowing and encouraging\nemployees to use their smartphones and laptops, rather than outlawing them as\nsome companies do, will promote social collaboration. Training employees will\nmake them more willing to participate, while opening their eyes to the\npossibilities and benefits of using social technologies.\n\n[Setting up a social media policy](https://www.krusecontrolinc.com/smart-\nsteps-to-engage-employees-in-social-media/) for staff to follow is an\nimportant step for integrating social media into an organization\u2019s workflow.\nThe implemented management system should state the protocol for handling\ncrises, set up guidelines for social media use and outline the benefits.\nHighlighting how employees can benefit from using Facebook, Instagram, Twitter\nor LinkedIn will motivate them to engage and participate.\n\nCreating a simple process will promote engagement in any workplace initiative,\nso using the right tools is important for getting employees involved. Slack\nand Dropbox are good examples of some of the options for bridging the gap\nbetween content creation and submission. Both tools have useful mobile apps\nfor working across different devices.\n\nFinally, tracking and analyzing an organization\u2019s social media efforts is a\ngreat way to reinforce the value and show employees what it can accomplish.\nChecking engagement on social media platforms and online reviews can provide\nevidence of a successful campaign. For engagement management, HR professionals\ncan use an employee engagement survey to uncover issues or collect suggestions\non how to improve within the organization.\n\n##\n\n## How can social media in HR improve employee engagement?\n\nCompanies can use social media as a tool to improve employee engagement,\nreinforce company culture and effectively teach team members new skills to\nincrease business outcomes. Punchball and Badgeville are popular social tools\nthat HR departments are using to increase employee engagement, motivate their\nteams and encourage training.\n\nWorking environment, company culture and individual experiences are key\ncontributors for long-term employee engagement. HR departments can use social\nmedia to give employees a voice to share feedback, views and opinions on the\norganization. Social media can allow managers to reach all employees, remote\nor not, and improve internal collaboration.\n\nTo use social media as an effective HR strategy, [employees need training and\nencouragement](https://jsbenefitsgroup.com/can-social-media-improve-employee-\nengagement/) to make the most of it. Social media itself is a tool for\nachieving this and can receive employee feedback, so managers know which areas\nneed the most improvement.\n\n##\n\n## Importance of social media beyond employee engagement\n\nSocial media has many HR functions besides employee engagement, including\n[talent acquisition, establishing a reputation and communicating\nculture](http://www.jobcast.net/the-importance-of-social-media-for-hr/). All\norganizations can use social media as a cost-effective tool to improve their\nbusiness and reach new milestones.\n\nEmployment-related social media sites such as LinkedIn can provide HR\nprofessionals with a large pool of talented candidates with ease. Social media\nincreases the size of an organization\u2019s audience, making recruiting easier and\ncheaper. It\u2019s an excellent tool for vetting candidates and shortening the\nhiring process.\n\nTo entice top candidates, companies can use social media to display their\ncorporate cultures. Team-building efforts, health and wellness initiatives and\noffice functions can be highlighted to give potential employees a glimpse of\nwhat it\u2019s like to work at an organization. Posting articles congratulating\nemployees\u2019 achievements is an example of a positive use of social media that\ncan build a company\u2019s reputation and give audiences a better understanding of\nits culture.\n\n_If you enjoyed this deep dive on HR in social media, you can[subscribe to our\ndaily Human Resources news\nbriefing](https://www2.smartbrief.com/signupSystem/subscribe.action?pageSequence=1&briefName=workforce&campaign=ad_organic_seo_2020)\nfor more informative content.

This is over and above the existing\nS$55bn set aside for COVID-19-related measures under the\n[Unity](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/singapore-budget-2020-key-\ntakeaways-for-hr-leaders-and-employers/) and\n[Resilience](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/singapores-s48bn-\ncovid-19-resilience-budget-key-takeaways-for-hr-and-employers/) Budgets.\n\nThe Solidarity Budget will focus on three key areas:\n\n### #1 Enhance protection for jobs and livelihoods\n\nThe Government's key focus of this area would be to save jobs and support\nwages, as well as to help self-employed persons (SEPs)\n\nHence, the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) will be further enhanced for the month of\nApril.\n\n  * For April 2020, the Government will help employers pay 75% on the first S$4,600 of monthly salaries for every local employee.\n  * From May 2020, wage support levels will return to original levels in the Resilience Budget - that is, 75% wage support for the aviation and tourism sectors, 50% for the food services sector, and 25% for all other sectors.\n\nAdditionally, the SEP Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) will see more SEPs\nqualifying for aid.\n\nThe SIRS will now automatically include SEPs who also earn a small income from\nemployment work. It will enhance the qualifying criterion annual value of\nproperty to S$21,000, up from S$13,000.\n\nEligible SEPs will receive three quarterly cash payouts of S$3,000 each in\nMay, July, and October 2020.\n\n### #2 Strengthen support for firms and workers\n\nUnder this area, the Government will focus on cash flow and credit support for\nemployers.\n\nKey measures include:\n\n  * Waiving the monthly Foreign Worker Levy (FWL) due in April 2020.\n  * FWL rebate of S$750 in April 2020 from levies paid this year, for each Work Permit or S Pass holder.\n  * 1-month rental waiver for office, commercial, and agricultural tenants of Government agencies.\n  * Loans under the EFS- Trade Loan, EFS-SME Working Capital Loan, and Temporary Bridging Loan Programme, initiated from 8 April 2020 till 31 March 2021, will see the Government's risk share raised from 80% to 90%.\n  * Laws will be put in place to ensure property owners pass on Property Tax rebate to tenants.\n\n### #3 Provide more help to Singaporeans\n\nTo provide timely support and help Singaporeans tide over this period, the\nGovernment is distributing an additional cash payout of S$300 for all\nSingaporeans aged 21 and above in 2020.\n\nThe Government will also advance S$300 from the enhanced Care & Support\npackage to be paid in April 2020.\n\n  * Singaporeans earning **not more than S$28,000 for the Year of Assessment (YA) 2019** will receive a total cash payment of S$1,200 (S$600 in April 2020, and S$600 in June 2020).\n  * Singaporeans earning **above S$28,000 to S$100,000 for YA2019** , will receive a total of S$900 (S$600 in April 2020 and S$300 in June 2020).\n  * Singaporeans earning **more than S$100,000 for YA2019** will receive a total of S$600 which will be paid out in whole in April 2020.\n\nFor the majority of Singaporeans who have provided their bank account details\nto the Government, the Solidarity Payment will be credited directly into their\nbank accounts by 14 April 2020. The rest will receive the payment by cheque,\nto be issued in stages later, starting from 30 April 2020.\n\nThe other payments from the Resilience Budget will remain and will be paid out\nin June 2020:\n\n  * S$300 cash payout for Singaporean parents with at least one Singaporean child aged 20 and below in 2020.\n  * S$100 PAssion Card cash top-up for all Singaporeans aged 50 and above in 2020.\n  * Total of up to S$1,000 in cash for eligible Singaporeans in June 2020.\n\n_Photo /[123RF](https://www.123rf.com/)_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

This is a catastrophic shift in the\nemotional landscape of the workplace, and it\u2019s only happened in a matter of\ndays.\" \u2013 Matt Stephens, Inpulse\n\nOf the 120 people polled between 13 and 17 March, 28% said they felt anxious,\n22% were distracted and 11% stressed. Until this point, \u201ccommitted\u201d\nrepresented 21% of all emotions chosen in engagement surveys undertaken by\nInpulse clients in 2020 \u2013 now just 14% of employees feel committed.\n\nMatt Stephens, CEO of Inpulse, said: \u201cWe have never seen these levels of\nanxiety and stress in \u2018normal\u2019 times, it is unprecedented and shows the impact\nCovid-19 has had on employees\u2019 wellbeing. We typically see high levels of\ncommitment and enthusiasm around employee jobs and their organisations.\n\n\u201cSadly, people are now consumed by the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic \u2013\nand it\u2019s massively impacting their work. This is a catastrophic shift in the\nemotional landscape of the workplace, and it\u2019s only happened in a matter of\ndays.\n\n\u201cThrough the survey, they\u2019ve told us they are anxious about job security. One\nsaid, enlighteningly, that they are stressed about having to choose between\nbeing committed to their work or being safe. On top of this some are consumed\nby their concerns, media updates and government announcements. Others are\nconcerned by poor communications from their employer.\u201d\n\nMore positively, 76% of employees said they had confidence in business\nleaders\u2019 ability to make the right decisions during these uncertain times.\n\nInpulse said it was important that organisations understood how their staff\nwere feeling and remained in regular contact with employees who were working\nfrom home or self-isolating.\n\nMeanwhile, a separate survey by jobs board CV-Library has found 87.9% of\nworkers feel their employer could do more to improve morale. The survey of\n2,300 UK professionals also found that being happy is the most important\naspect of a job for employees, as stated by 61.7%.\n\nCEO and founder Lee Biggins said: \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important for employees to\nfeel happy at work, not only for their personal wellbeing, but also for your\nbusiness output. Long-term unhappiness simply isn\u2019t sustainable or healthy for\nthe mental health of your employees and it can impact their productivity and\nefficiency.\n\n\u201cSo, if you think you\u2019re doing all you can to keep your staff happy, you may\nwant to think again. You can improve morale across the whole workforce by\nscheduling in regular check-ups and meetings, offering the right perks and\nencouraging a healthy work-life balance. You want to create a company culture\nthat everyone, yourself included, wants to be a part of.\u201d\n\n[Previous

About\nTechnology\\)](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/iei7upoffuyv-\nvzcgqcxua.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * Create the shift you need in HR by focusing on people, not just technology\n  * Start by building HR capabilities into your managers and leaders\n  * Build inspiring leadership with a crucial shift in organizational mindset\n\nHR transformation is often about changing the way HR delivers its services.\nSearch for \"HR transformation\" on the internet, and the majority of results\nwill inevitably lead you to HR _digital_ transformation. Technology is almost\nalways at the center of transforming the way an organization experiences HR\nservices. While that's not necessarily a bad thing, there needs to be a shift\ntoward making people, not technology, the priority.\n\nBut there's a problem. On their path to improving their management approach,\ntoo many leaders and managers outsource the soft skills, people development\nefforts and cultural aspects of their role to HR technology and HR partners.\nExamples include:\n\n>   * **learning and development trainings** that replace managers' role in\n> developing their people\n>   * **upskilling and reskilling initiatives from learning platforms** that\n> replace managers preparing their people for the future\n>   * **selection assessments dictating hiring decisions** that replace\n> talented managers having a say in building their teams' HR business partners\n> -- and that lead to generic feedback sessions instead of great leaders\n> having authentic and open conversations with their teams\n>   * **wellbeing programs** that replace managers and leaders taking a\n> genuine interest in their employees' lives, inside and outside of work\n>\n\nAs long as leaders and managers continue to outsource the soft skills of their\njob to HR technology and HR partners, they will miss the key experiences\nneeded to become engaging executive leaders who know how to build successful\nhigh-development and high-performance cultures.\n\n### Real HR Transformation Is About Transforming HR\n\nHR needs a different kind of transformation.\n\nThe real HR transformation should not be about changing technology -- it\nshould be about changing HR. Rather than changing the way the business\nexperiences HR, real HR transformation should be about transforming the role\nof HR in business.\n\nAlready, much of HR's role in some organizations is being placed in legal, IT\nand finance, while the remaining parts of HR are focused on being internal\nconsultants to the business. HR transformations that restructure HR into\ncenters of excellence reinforce this idea of HR partners being internal\nexperts, consultants and advisers to the business.\n\n**HR needs to be integrated with business, and business needs to be integrated\nwith HR.** But is that all HR should be to the company? Consultants? Trainers?\nAdvisers? Partners? Should they be more? The answer is _yes_! There is a\nmissed opportunity for HR to change the way leaders lead and [managers\nmanage](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/251642/manager.aspx).\n\n### **Do You Know Your Company 's Current State of Executive Leadership and\nManagement?**\n\nThe state of leadership and management is broken, and HR transformation needs\nto be about building HR capabilities into managers and leaders. Some of this\nis already happening, but it needs to be accelerated with a stronger push if\nthings are going to change in a meaningful way in the years to come.\n\nGlobally, just [one in three](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/258197/why-\nleaders-employees-trust-don.aspx) employees strongly agree that they trust the\nleadership of their organization, and two-thirds believe there is [widespread\ncorruption in business](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/244973/future-work-\ntrust-download.aspx). Among U.S. employees,\n[15%](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/268310/leaders-craft-inspirational-\nstrategic-narrative.aspx) strongly agree that their leaders make them feel\nenthusiastic about the future, and 13% say the leadership of their\norganization communicates effectively. CEOs are leaving at [record-high\ndeparture rates](https://www.strategy-business.com/article/Succeeding-the-\nlong-serving-legend-in-the-corner-\noffice?gko=90171&utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_288437&utm_medium=copy),\nand CEO tenure has dropped from eight years to five. Mergers and acquisitions\nfail to realize their intended benefits [70% to\n90%](https://hbr.org/2016/06/ma-the-one-thing-you-need-to-get-\nright?utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_288437&utm_medium=copy) of the\ntime, with [47%](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/267494/stop-losing-talent-\nmerge-acquire.aspx) of key employees leaving within one year of the\ntransaction -- and 75% within three years.\n\nLife expectancies of companies are dropping dramatically. Fortune 1000 firms\nare now expected to last less than [15\nyears](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/il/Documents/human-\ncapital/HR_and_Business_Perspectives_on_The%20Future_of_Work.pdf?utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_288437&utm_medium=copy),\non average, and S&P firms only five years. People are running from leaders as\nfast as they can, and there needs to be a revolution to turn them around.\n\nGlobally, just one in three employees strongly agree that they trust the\nleadership of their organization, and two-thirds believe there is widespread\ncorruption in business.\n\nWhen it comes to managers, [only 35% are engaged at\nwork](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/259820/manager-experience-challenges-\nperk-perspective-paper.aspx). Employees worldwide are not inspired by the\nannual review conversations they're having with their manager (only\n[14%](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/215927/performance-management.aspx) say\nthey're inspired by their performance reviews). Employees in Europe and the\nU.S. say their organization isn't\n[agile](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/241295/future-work-agility-\ndownload.aspx) enough.\n\nThere needs to be a mindset shift in management -- a fundamental change to the\nphilosophy of management.\n\n### **Transform the HR Mindset, Career Paths and Training**\n\nReal HR transformation requires getting the cultural mindset shift right\n_before_ making the necessary technological or structural changes.\n\nFor example, Gallup's [Real Future of\nWork](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/232382/real-future-work.aspx) research\non European employees reveals that mindset defines agility much more than team\nstructure does. Make sure workers understand why your mission matters to them\npersonally; currently, only four in 10 U.S. employees feel connected to the\n[mission or purpose of their\ncompany](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236279/three-ways-mission-driven-\nworkplaces-perform-better.aspx). A 10% improvement in employees' connection\nwith the mission or purpose of their organization would result in an [8.1%\ndecrease](https://news.gallup.com/reports/191489/q12-meta-analysis-\nreport-2016.aspx) in turnover and a 4.4% increase in profitability.\n\nWhile leadership and management need a revolution, having HR double down on\nits strategy to consult and advise may not be the major course correction that\nbusinesses need.\n\nHR needs to become an\n[experience](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/265886/why-leaders-become-\nceo.aspx) for business leaders, and the business needs to become an experience\nfor HR leaders. HR leaders are positioned to increase human capital returns\nduring a merger and acquisition, conquer agility by creating a culture of\npsychological safety, and build trust internally and externally. Change the\npath to CEO, CFO, COO and CHRO. Don't cut them from the same cloth, which has\nproduced the current state of executive leadership.\n\nFor the largest companies, HR is getting more and more focused on workforce\nplanning, including upskilling, reskilling, workforce reduction and future-of-\nwork planning. To meet this growing demand, HR needs to transform from\ninternal consultants to leaders of the business. That doesn't necessarily mean\nputting HR in charge tomorrow. It does mean putting HR _into_ business leaders\nand managers today.\n\nHR can provide a set of skills that business leaders and managers need to\ndevelop. CEOs should have HR capabilities, not just HR partners, just as much\nas they should have financial capabilities and not just financial partners.\n\nHow this development is provided needs to go beyond training from HR and into\nexperiential training within HR. Gallup's research shows ethics training\nprograms have [limited impact](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/244973/future-\nwork-trust-download.aspx).\n\nEqually, upskilling and reskilling training does not increase training\nparticipants' confidence that the company is preparing them for the future\nnearly as much as creating an organization that is focused on building the\n[strengths](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/247514/strengths-based-\nculture.aspx) of each employee (nearly five times the impact of training) or\nmanagers who are great at providing ongoing feedback (twice the\n[impact](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/265934/future-work-issue-\ndisruption.aspx) of training).\n\n![Custom graphic. The skills of the future come from everyday conversations\nand strengths-based\ncultures.](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/9wwvmnowokmtyjg6sv_9ew.png)\n\nHR should provide training that teaches leaders and managers the soft skills\nthat drive change, such as focusing on\n[strengths](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253832/cliftonstrengths-\nfor-teams.aspx), instilling purpose, building relationships, providing\n[ongoing, meaningful\nfeedback](https://www.gallup.com/itsthemanager/245402/boss-to-coach.aspx), and\ncreating great team environments. Essentially, moving from boss to coach.\n\nIn a recent Gallup study, organizations that invested in learning programs\nusing the concepts of **strengths** , **engagement** and **ongoing performance\ndevelopment** realized a 14-percentage-point increase, on average, in the\nproportion of employees who were engaged -- compared with an average increase\nof eight points in companies that did not invest in learning programs.\nAdditionally, among 70 of the organizations included in the study, managers\nwho received training on these soft skills experienced _twice_ the\nproductivity gains of those among managers who didn't participate in these\nstrengths-based courses.\n\n![Line graph. Investing in strengths-based manager courses improves employee\nengagement.](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/tvhrcb59tkuzng4mh3wuvg.png)\n\nTraining alone won't prepare your workforce for the future, but creating great\nmanagers will -- and that's where training should focus.\n\n### **Take the Different Path in Leadership**\n\n**To HR leaders:** Lead the business as an HR leader rather than just leading\nHR programs. Do this by upskilling and reskilling the workforce with capable\nmanagers and not just capable curricula. Increase\n[diversity](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/215939/diversity-inclusion.aspx)\nin leadership by empowering leaders to individualize inclusion with strengths-\nbased approaches, rather than only managing generalized stereotypes and\ndemographics.\n\n**To business leaders:** Lead HR as a business leader rather than outsourcing\naspects of your leadership role to HR partners and HR technology. Remember,\nselection assessments exist to help managers make great decisions, not decide\nfor them. [Engagement surveys](https://www.gallup.com/access/239210/employee-\nengagement-survey.aspx) exist to empower ongoing coaching, not serve as an\nannual HR event.\n\nTraining alone won't prepare your workforce for the future, but creating great\nmanagers will -- and that's where training should focus.\n\nReal transformation is about changing HR and not just HR technology.\nPrioritize people to change the way you lead and manage today.\n\n### **Discover these resources to begin your real HR transformation today:**\n\n  * Uncover Gallup's latest research, findings and best practices on what it takes to deliver high performance in today's changing workplace.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nCat Graham\n\nCat Graham, Managing Partner, [Cheer Partners,](http://www.cheerpartners.com/)\nhas more than 20 years\u2019 experience as an HR and Talent leader.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nPhoto:\n\nGetty\n\nHuman resources departments have come a long way over the past few years, but\nnot unlike the soccer coach who brought her team to finals last year, the\npressure is on to do even better this year. Employees are holding their\nleaders accountable for every commitment they make. Successful organizations\nmust trend-spot by holding two-way dialogue with their employees and stay\nabreast of what the competition is doing.\n\nHuman resources can use the levers in their organization, from employees and\ncommunications to leadership, to drive a culture that makes everyone feel a\nsense of belonging and connection. The best employee experiences prioritize\nconnection, which is a top driver of engagement. Here are five strategies you\ncan employ today.\n\n**1\\. Prioritize Mobile**\n\nYour employees engage with brands and friends on mobile applications. Their\nexperience with their employer should maximize this trend. You likely already\nhave your payroll and benefits available on mobile, and there is so much more\nyou can do. Your internal channels should be available on their phones so they\ncan chat, join meetings and access your intranet. There are several platforms\nyou can use to share company news, employee news and encourage social sharing.\n\nGo a little further with your email notices. Typically you have just seconds\nto get your recipient's attention, so your emails should be visual, mobile-\nfriendly and concise. If you are using video, ensure it is mobile-friendly as\nwell, and keep it under one minute long. Use your current external channels to\nfeature employees and work life at your organization. Similar to watching an\nInstagram story from their friends, they want to see casual and fun\ninteractions from their team. A good approach is social ambassadors, who will\nvolunteer to take photos at events and curate your content.\n\n**2\\. Empower Internal Influencers**\n\nThis year, the trend continues where employees want to direct their own\nexperiences. You could have the best HR strategy in the world, but it is the\nemployees who drive its success. Take advantage of that by identifying\ninternal influencers to help drive and measure the success of your programs.\nThis serves two purposes: those influencers you identify feel recognition, and\nthey feel empowered to engage with their colleagues as a leader.\n\nYour influencers can help drive the adoption of key programs and create\nenthusiasm for participation in company events. They can also provide key\ninsights to help you pivot your programs. Include them in regular meetings so\nthey can share their voices and feedback and maximize their scope.\n\n**3\\. Humanize Leaders**\n\nEmployee activism is only getting stronger this year, and while not every\norganization can align with the flatter organization trends, employees want to\nknow who their leaders are. The recent departures of high-profile executives\nonly serves to increase this curiosity. Develop programs for all leaders to\ncreate conversation. Town halls serve their purpose and can be amplified with\nfireside chats and \"ask me anything\" hours, either live or through your chat\nchannel.\n\nEncourage your leaders to revisit their bios and share more of who they are\nbeyond the black and white of their resume. They should share their values,\noutside interests and reasons for choosing the field they are in. Encourage\nyour communications team to help them understand the value of storytelling in\nall communications to employees. Include leaders with employees on in-service\ndays to show alignment and encourage connectivity.\n\n**4\\. Get Visual**\n\nWritten content is no longer king. The most highly engaging communications are\nvisual. You don't need a full studio to achieve great results. Start by\ndefining your visual brand guidelines. Set the parameters for how employees\nand leaders can get photos and videos when attending events. You can achieve a\ngreat result with your phone or an iPad using a tripod and a lapel mic.\n\nStart a customer success series where you can create short videos you can use\ninternally as well as externally showcasing the employee and the customer\nsuccess story. Use infographics and polls in your communications. For large\nrollouts, employ visual storyboards. Similar to the content your employees\nread on their phones, your employee-facing content should be equally visual.\n\n**5\\. Voice Of Employee Program**\n\nEmployees are talking, and our job is to harness their voices to drive\norganizational success. Successful Voice of Employee programs are designed\nwith multiple channels that ensure every voice is heard, and their views can\nshape the decisions the company makes.\n\nOnline engagement surveys are one way, but why not consider a graffiti wall\nusing a whiteboard anyone can write on? Create a space where you can have an\nidea lab, where any employee can jump in and share their big idea, either\nthrough a chat channel or a physical space. Leader forums are also very\nsuccessful: Leaders bring big issues or opportunities to an open-invite\nmeeting for anyone to join in. Get creative.\n\nA colleague of mine recently shared the famous proverb, \"If you want to go\nquickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\" By harnessing your\nemployees, leaders, peers and colleagues, you can build an incredible\nexperience for your organization, including for yourself. Remember, keep it\nfun, and make it intentional.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Cat Graham](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2018/04/catgraham_avatar_1524510574.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/catgraham/\n\"Photo of Cat Graham\")\n\n[Cat\nGraham](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/catgraham/)\n\nCat Graham, Managing Partner, [Cheer Partners,](http://www.cheerpartners.com)\nhas more than 20 years\u2019 experience as an HR and Talent leader.\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Cat Graham&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: Five HR Strategies To Amplify The Employee Experience In 2020 %0A Author: Cat Graham %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2020/03/16/five-hr-strategies-to-amplify-the-employee-experience-in-2020/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

https://www.times.co.nz/news/covid-19sport-recreation-\nsurvey-identifies-much-needed-support/)\n\n__\n\nLockdown uncertainty, loss of membership, human resources, solvency and\nrecovery plans are among key aspects keeping Auckland sport and recreation\norganisations awake at night as the country faces Covid-19.\n\nInitiated by Aktive, the survey was conducted in late March and received 168\nresponses, providing valuable statistically valid insights into understand the\npandemic\u2019s current and potential impact on the sector. With the majority (94%)\nof respondents cancelling events or programmes, and around one quarter (23%)\nindicating cashflow and resources to support operations will last one to four\nweeks, the survey identified immediate areas of concern.\n\nDr Sarah Sandley, CE, Aktive says the noted aspects, along with communications\nand legal guidance, are addressed in a comprehensive plan that is already\nbeing implemented.\n\n\"Along with our partners, we want to ensure that all clubs, codes and\norganisations are as equipped as best possible to respond to the impact of\nCovid-19,\" says Dr Sandley. \"This survey has provided valuable insights and we\nare focusing capabilities and resources to provide fast and effective\ndeployment of targeted support.\n\n\"We are also facilitating online networking opportunities so people in the\nsector can share ideas and solutions. We know it\u2019s a tough time for many\npeople and this engagement is important for both the sector and personal\nwellbeing.\"\n\nNearly three quarters (72%) of the 168 survey respondents indicated they have\naccess to technology and facilities to work remotely, supporting such\nengagement.

This negativity adversely\naffects employee engagement as well as staff turnover.\n\n**HR News:** \u200b\u200b[Preeti Kaul Appointed As HR Head at\nupGrad](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/hr-tech-news/preeti-kaul-\nappointed-as-hr-head-at-upgrad/)\n\n[Globalization Partners](https://www.globalization-partners.com/about-us/)\u2019\n2020 global employee survey, 'Examining the Impact of Diversity on Distributed\nGlobal Teams', asked 1,725 randomly selected employees about their experience\nas distributed global team members. The research reveals that global teams are\nstruggling with communications with 46% of employees relying mostly on email,\nbut only 31% find it effective.\n\n### **Other key findings include:**\n\n  * Two-thirds of companies are finding it challenging to align with and be sensitive to local culture and communication styles, especially when a company spans multiple geographies.\n  * Organizations that embrace multilingualism are seeing better team results across the board.\n  * Nearly nine out of ten employees (89 percent) say their company would benefit from the assistance of outside experts to help with cultural training and cross-organization education.\n\n  \n\u201cGartner predicts that by the end of 2022, 75 percent of organizations with\nfrontline decision-making teams in distributed geographies and with diverse\nmindsets will exceed their financial targets. As a company with offices in\nevery corner of the globe, I\u2019ve seen the incredible business advantage in\nhiring and building diverse teams,\u201d said Nicole Sahin, CEO of [Globalization\nPartners](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/hr-tech-news/globalization-\npartners-closes-150-million-minority-investment/). \u201cI also know that now more\nthan ever, in these trying times it is critical to have the right\ncommunication tools in place to ensure success. The employee experience\nmatters now more than ever, and collaboration tools like Slack can make a\npositive impact on the ability for teams to collaborate on projects and\nprovide a social connection for employees around the world.\u201d\n\n**HR News:**[Skedulo's New Deskless Productivity Cloud Aims to Boost Employee\nEngagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/employee-engagement/skedulos-\nnew-deskless-productivity-cloud-aims-to-boost-employee-engagement-4/)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdiversity%2F41-of-\nemployees-struggle-to-communicate-with-their-employers-surveys-globalization-\npartners-\ninc%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=41%25+of+Employees+Struggle+to+Communicate+With+Their+Employers%2C+Surveys+Globalization+Partners+Inc\n\"Share this News on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=41%25+of+Employees+Struggle+to+Communicate+With+Their+Employers%2C+Surveys+Globalization+Partners+Inc&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdiversity%2F41-of-\nemployees-struggle-to-communicate-with-their-employers-surveys-globalization-\npartners-\ninc%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this News on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdiversity%2F41-of-\nemployees-struggle-to-communicate-with-their-employers-surveys-globalization-\npartners-\ninc%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this News on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdiversity%2F41-of-\nemployees-struggle-to-communicate-with-their-employers-surveys-globalization-\npartners-\ninc%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this News on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-email-\nicon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=41% of Employees Struggle to Communicate With\nTheir Employers, Surveys Globalization Partners\nInc&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fdiversity%2F41-of-\nemployees-struggle-to-communicate-with-their-employers-surveys-globalization-\npartners-\ninc%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this News via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Diversity ](/category/diversity/ \"Diversity\")\n\n  * [ ![Why Diversity Matters in the Workplace: Q&A With HPE\u2019s Alan May](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/hewlett_packard_enterprise_hr_talk_interview_545_x_240_px_5e32b7306a2f2.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/diversity/hpe-alan-may-why-diversity-matters/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Why Diversity Matters in the Workplace: Q&A; With HPE\u2019s Alan May\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/diversity/hpe-alan-may-why-\ndiversity-matters/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nAlan May of HPE, discusses the values of diversity and inclusion in the\nworkplace.

enable\n[WorkJam](https://www.workjam.com/2020/04/workjam-raises-50-million-series-c-\nto-meet-growing-demand/) to continue with innovation, geographical expansion,\nseek acquisitions, and invest in

It will also help the company advance in its mission\nto help businesses achieve breakthrough cost-savings and productivity\nincreases while cultivating an engaged and motivated deskless employee\nworkforce.\n\nAdded to this, Inovia Capital's Growth Fund brings the deep operating\nexpertise of its partners Dennis Kavelman and Patrick Pichette, former CFO's\nof BlackBerry and Google, respectively, as well as founder Chris Arsenault and\nthe experience of Inovia's global team and network of advisors to WorkJam.\nKavelman will be joining WorkJam's board of directors.

We believe that given the current environment, it has never\nbeen more clear that every company with a frontline workforce will require a\ndigital workplace platform like WorkJam's, now, and into the future.\"\n\nCurrently, there are over 1.5 million frontline employees using WorkJam's\nDigital Workplace Platform across 35 countries, operating in 28 languages.\nDeployed across multiple industries, WorkJam's platform enables deskless\nemployees with scheduling capabilities, an open shift marketplace, task\nmanagement, bi-directional communication between frontline and headquarters\nstaff, mobile punching, training, surveys, and more into a unified set of\nmobile or desktop-based modules that can be deployed separately or together\nwithin five days. With a history of working with mid-size and large\nenterprises, WorkJam has extensive experience in enabling communications and\nproductivity improvements for frontline workforces and has built into the\nplatform its expertise and experience in compliance needs, work rules,\nworkflows and best practices in optimizing employee engagement and cost-\ncutting.\n\n\"WorkJam's vision has always been to help a broad spectrum of businesses \u2014\nfrom mid-sized companies to larger enterprises \u2014 improve the management and\nlivelihood of their frontline workforces,\" said Steven Kramer, CEO, and\nPresident of WorkJam. \"We've always believed in the positive impact our\ntechnology has on non-desk workers and the business goals of the companies\nthat employ them.

HR has come a long way from processing employee paperwork to\nnow holding a strategic position and often a chief seat at the senior\nleadership table. Having founded a platform for complete candidate skills and\njob fit assessment, I see firsthand how adequate insight into candidates\u2019\nskills and behaviors can offer HR teams invaluable information that can aid in\nmeeting the most pressing personnel challenges.\n\nTo help you stay abreast of the changes, here is a closer look at the issues\nfacing HR this year:\n\n**1\\. Finding And Landing High-Quality Talent**\n\nWhen it comes to acquiring top talent, the game has changed. The tight labor\nmarket continues to create significant challenges for HR. In XpertHR\u2019s\nrecently released [survey](https://hrexecutive.com/these-are-the-top-hr-\nchallenges-in-2020/), \"Top HR Trends for 2020,\" HR professionals reported\nrecruiting and hiring as their most critical challenge. Of those respondents,\n51% said that their organization is facing an \u201cextreme challenge\u201d recruiting\nand hiring high-quality candidates, more than double the number (22%) from\njust two years ago.\n\nSo how can companies begin to bend the cost- and time-to-hire curves backward?\nCreate competitive advantages for talent processes by offering tailored\nincentives. Use skills tests and behavioral assessments during the initial\nstage of the hiring process, and determine what motivates top talent. For some\nnew hires, it may mean a larger paycheck, but for most employees, it means\ndevelopment opportunities, flexible working conditions, management\nresponsibilities, greater autonomy, a better job title or even the chance to\ndo good in the world.\n\n**2\\. The Revolving Door Of Talent**\n\nThe World Health Organization made headlines last year when it classified\nburnout as a medical diagnosis, [defining\nburnout](https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/burn-out/en/) as \u201ca\nsyndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has\nnot been successfully managed.\u201d Sixty-two percent of respondents to a survey\npublished in Emplify's \u201c2020 Employee Engagement Trends\u201d\n[report](https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/a-new-workplace-study-says-\nhappy-burnout-proof-employees-boils-down-to-3-things.html) suffer from burnout\nat work. In the face of widespread burnout, it is not surprising that the same\nstudy found nearly 73% of respondents are open to new career opportunities,\nand for respondents who have been employed by their current company for less\nthan a year, that number is 77%.\n\nThe fight to retain top talent starts with making employee wellness a\npriority. Though the answer may not be as obvious as it seems, a\n[study](https://doi.org/10.1108/CDI-12-2016-0215) published in the journal\n_Career Development International_ found that many highly engaged employees\nare also exhausted and ready to leave their employer. Companies are at the\nmost significant risk of losing their most motivated and hard-working\nemployees due to high stress and burnout.\n\nThe solution? Develop processes to ensure that workloads are more reasonable.\nOffer flexible work options. Create a company culture that encourages work-\nlife balance. And educate staff about the warning signs of burnout and ways to\ncombat it.\n\n**3\\. Developing The Next Generation Of Leaders**\n\nBusinesses spend [billions of\ndollars](https://www.chieflearningofficer.com/2018/03/21/follow-the-\nleadership-spending/) annually on leadership development. The scarcity of in-\ndemand talent and the high cost of attracting and retaining talent means many\ncorporations are setting their sights on inside talent. Employees are more\nmotivated to stay with a company that offers leadership training, according to\na recent [survey](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/study-shows-workers-require-\ninnovative-130000257.html). However, 47% of respondents are dissatisfied with\ntheir employer\u2019s current learning and development opportunities and would\nprefer more flexibility in learning opportunities and real-world application\nwherever possible.\n\nTo retain employees, organizations need to create or expand leadership\ndevelopment programs to meet the needs of their workforce. Implementing\ninnovative approaches to learning new skills, such as self-guided online\nlearning, on-the-job coaching and virtual training can help improve engagement\nand lower costly employee turnover.\n\n**4\\. Finding Resources For Workforce Development**\n\nWhile mega-companies like Amazon are investing hundreds of millions of dollars\nin [workforce development\ninitiatives](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/11/740660070/from-the-warehouse-to-\nit-amazon-offering-100-000-workers-tech-training), many businesses are\nreluctant to invest heavily in training and development. Although there is no\npromise of a return on investment, organizations of all sizes should initiate\ntraining strategies and structures that grow over time and deliver a\ncompetitive advantage. Investing in the training and development of entry-\nlevel employees is a strategy that is gaining momentum, as their positions are\nmost easily filled once the trainee moves up the corporate ladder.\n\nTraining and development don\u2019t have to consume a massive portion of your\nbudget. Online evaluations and training courses are relatively inexpensive and\ncan provide employees with in-depth insight into their own skill sets and a\nself-guided path for learning new skills or improving existing skills.\nInvesting in your workforce will create a loyal, productive team.\n\n**5\\. Achieving Diversity With Inclusion**\n\nWorkplace bias \u2014 both conscious and unconscious \u2014 continues to impede the\nhiring, development and promotion of underrepresented groups. Although many\ncompanies have made great strides in hiring a more diverse workforce in recent\nyears, the likelihood that organizations will be able to retain this staff\nwithout explicitly structuring an inclusive workplace is low. Evaluating\nskills and gaining insight into behavioral patterns prior to an interview can\nhelp combat bias by elevating candidates based on job-fit metrics, not\ndemographics.\n\nIf HR focuses on diversity without creating a culture of inclusion, the\ndiverse mix of people we hire will be less likely to stay. Organizations must\nestablish strong policies to protect employees from negative behaviors.\nCreating a culture of inclusivity improves retention and acts as a magnet for\ntalent, drawing a more diverse set of applications. Companies must build an\ninclusive culture. Training to policies to ensure people are aware of their\nbiases and aware of how to not act on them is critical.\n\nAlthough the tight labor market presents some unique challenges, adopting\nthese recommendations can help your organization stay ahead of the curve.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Eric Friedman](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2019/07/ericfriedman_avatar_1563822669-400x400.jpeg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/ericfriedman/\n\"Photo of Eric Friedman\")\n\n[Eric\nFriedman](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/ericfriedman/)\n\nEric Friedman is the Founder and CEO of [eSkill](http://www.eskill.com), a\nglobal leader in skills testing and behavioral assessment solutions for\nemployers.\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Eric Friedman&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: Top Five Issues Facing Human Resources In 2020 %0A Author: Eric Friedman %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2020/04/06/top-five-issues-facing-human-resources-in-2020/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

This is often backed up\nby a robust internal communications campaign ensuring teams are aware of the\nactivity, how to complete it, and why it\u2019s important.\n\nIt\u2019s a comprehensive process requiring great input from your HR team, which is\nwhy it can be frustrating when [response\nrates](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/articles/why-you-\nneed-to-stop-asking-the-question-how-to-be-a-good-leader) fail to meet\nexpectations.

But [great\nsurvey questions](https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/good-survey-\nquestions/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=hr-network&utm_campaign=2019--apj--\nads--iqpc-hren&utm_content=2019-12link2) are the foundation for great\nresearch.\n\n  1. **Keep your survey simple**\n\nThink about how you feel when completing lengthy surveys. Things get boring\nvery quickly.\n\nIf you\u2019re bored, your employees are going to be feeling the same way. While\nthere is no ideal length of your survey, the key is to find a balance between\nasking enough questions to be robust, and not asking so many questions your\npeople switch off. As a general rule, assuming you\u2019re running an annual\nengagement diagnostic we advise limiting your survey to around 40 questions.\n\nWhen a survey is too long, three bad things can happen:\n\n  1. **Respondents drop out:** A high drop-out rate can influence the quality of your results. \n  2. **People stop paying attention:** If it takes too long to take your survey people are more likely to quit the process and return to their work. We actually see this a lot, and encourage researchers to [use attention filters](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-flow/advanced-elements/screen-out-management/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=hr-network&utm_campaign=2019--apj--ads--iqpc-hren&utm_content=2019-12link5).\n  3. **Employees get angry:** The irony of upsetting employees with an overly long engagement survey is not lost on your respondents.\n\nThe best way to collect quality employee experience data is to keep your\nsurveys short, simple, and well organised.\n\n  2. **Use scale questions**\n\nRather than asking respondents a basic yes or no question, [use question\nscales](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-\nmodule/survey-flow/advanced-elements/screen-out-\nmanagement/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=hr-network&utm_campaign=2019--apj--\nads--iqpc-hren&utm_content=2019-12link6) that measure both the direction and\nthe intensity of opinions. This is critical for research because someone who\n\u201cStrongly Supports\u201d a decision is very different from someone who only\n\u201cSlightly Supports\u201d it.\n\nScales extend the power of analysis from basic percentages to high-level\nanalyses based on means and variance estimates. With scales you will get more\ninformation from each question.\n\n  3. **Keep coded values consistent**\n\nEvery survey response, option, question, or answer is coded as a numeric value\nthat is reported as a percent of responses or as a mean, median, range, etc.\nThese values are the basis for analysis.\n\nValues must be coded consistently. Generally, we assign the highest value to\nthe best outcome (ie \u201cStrongly Agree\u201d that customer service is responsive) and\nthen move down from there.\n\nWhen it comes to the vidual layout of the survey, for simplicity keep your\nscale direction consistent throughout. This makes it easier for respondents to\nanswer and for you to analyse. Additionally, avoid displaying your questions\nin blocks as this can reinforce rate acquiesce.\n\n  4. **Explain why respondents should participate**\n\nRespondents are more likely to take your survey if they see something of\npositive value for them.\n\nValue offerings can range from a very general altruistic appeal for their help\nto a very specific offer of an economic incentive. For example, with employee\nevaluations you can explain that feedback will be used to determine awards,\npromotions, and pay raises and will help management make organisational\ndecisions that will affect them.\n\nTo unlock impactful insights from your workfroce, download your free copy of\nthe [Essential Guide to Employee Experience\nSurveys](https://www.qualtrics.com/au/lp/ebook/essential-guide-to-employee-\nexperience-surveys/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=hr-\nnetwork&utm_campaign=2019--apj--ads--iqpc-hren&utm_content=2019-12link4).

Well, on this St. Patrick's\nDay, we are lucky to have our guest Greg Kirsch with us today. Greg is a\nSenior Vice President of Learning and Development at Intouch Group. He is a\nkey player in making Intouch a strengths-based and engagement-focused\norganization. Greg specifically leads a team of learning professionals whose\nmission is to empower Intouchers by nurturing talents and strengths and\nenabling continuous learning for personal and professional growth.

Greg, could you please share with us your strengths as we kick off\ntoday?\n\nGreg Kirsch 2:10  \n  \nHi, Lindsey. Thanks for having me. Sure. I'm\n[Maximizer](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252299/maximizer-\ntheme.aspx),\n[Positivity](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252305/positivity-\ntheme.aspx),\n[Strategic](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252350/strategic-\ntheme.aspx),\n[Communication](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252185/communication-\ntheme.aspx) and\n[Futuristic](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252248/futuristic-\ntheme.aspx). And if you want me to keep going, I can.\n\nLindsey Spehn 2:23  \n  \nPlease, yes!\n\nGreg Kirsch 2:24  \n  \nLet's see, No. 6 is\n[Woo](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252359/woo-theme.aspx); that\nshould make Jim happy. Woo is the best strength, according to Jim. Yay!\n[Ideation](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252260/ideation-\ntheme.aspx) is No. 7.\n[Empathy](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252236/empathy-\ntheme.aspx) is No. 8.\n[Arranger](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252161/arranger-\ntheme.aspx), my only [Executing\ntheme](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253736/cliftonstrengths-\ndomains.aspx#ite-253169), is No. 9, and\n[Includer](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/252266/includer-\ntheme.aspx) rounds it out at [the Top\n10](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253868/popular-\ncliftonstrengths-assessment-products.aspx).\n\nLindsey Spehn 2:45  \n  \nFantastic. Thanks for sharing that. I think that always helps our listeners\nknow a little bit more about you. So as Jim and I were putting our heads\ntogether and our growing space of small- and medium-sized clients, when we are\nthinking about success stories to share, Intouch came into mind pretty\nquickly. And today, we'll hear a little bit more about Intouch Group's journey\nto become a strengths-based, engagement-focused organization.\n\nLindsey Spehn 3:10  \n  \nSo today we'll kick it off to Greg to share a little bit more about his\norganization. We'll kind of divvy up the day or the session with learning more\nabout how it all came to be -- how did the strengths and engagement journey\nhappen? We'll get into some strategies and the approach that Intouch took, and\nthen we'll close with some of the impact that they've seen so far. So let's\nget to it. Greg, could you share a little bit more about Intouch for our\naudience?\n\nGreg Kirsch 3:37  \n  \nSure. Intouch is a leading ad agency for the pharmaceutical industry, for --\nwe're in the pharmaceutical space. We are -- we're headquartered in Kansas\nCity, but we've got a presence across the United States. And in fact, we've\ngot a small presence in London and Mumbai as well. Our headquarters in Kansas\nCity, offices in Chicago, New York, Boston, San Francisco, San Diego. And like\nI said, a small presence internationally.\n\nLindsey Spehn 4:09  \n  \nGreat, and about how many employees do you have?\n\nGreg Kirsch 4:12  \n  \nWe're right at 1,000. Right at about 1,000 employees. And yeah, it's, it's\namazing to me, because I was actually the -- I was employee No. 94 when I\nstarted in 2008. So it's been pretty remarkable to see this fantastic growth.\n\nLindsey Spehn 4:26  \n  \nYeah, I know, it's been a pleasure to get to partner with you and the Intouch\nteam along the journey. So maybe let's kick off with telling us a little bit\nmore about how it all began.\n\nGreg Kirsch 4:35  \n  \nOK, sure. Well, I -- I'm gonna have to go back to kind of when I got involved\nin strengths. I, I've been kind of a fan of strengths since the beginning. I\nthink I took my my first assessment in 2002 and was just really fascinated\nwith the philosophy of strengths. It was, it was just so refreshing to know\nthat there, there are some things that I do better than, than a lot of other\npeople. And throughout my whole career, I've kind of been told, Gee, you need\nto do this better or you need to do that better. It's just refreshing to find\nout those things that I'm really good at and focus on those.\n\nGreg Kirsch 5:11  \n  \nAnd so, 2002 took my first assessment; read all the books, I read, [_First,\nBreak All the Rules_](https://store.gallup.com/p/en-us/10286/first,-break-all-\nthe-rules); _Now, Discover Your Strengths_ , and so forth; became kind of a\nfan. I started at Intouch in 2008. And I was looking for a way to get my team\nengaged that I was managing at the time, and I thought, well, strengths would\nbe a perfect way to do that. So I went out and bought [_StrengthsFinder\n2.0_](https://store.gallup.com/p/en-\nus/10385/strengthsfinder-2.0-\\(hardcover\\)) for all of them and had them take\nthe assessment, and, and then I would talk to them about their strengths and\ntry to leverage their strengths and so forth. And, and it was, it was, it was\nsuccessful -- everybody seemed to buy into the philosophy.\n\nGreg Kirsch 5:50  \n  \nSo I went to the head of HR at the time and I said, Hey, we ought to do this\nfor everybody. And like I said, I was, I was employee No. 94, so the head of\nHR at the time said, \"Sure.\" So we went out and bought a bunch of\nStrengthsFinder 2.0 books and gave them to all the new employees. And it was,\nit was great. I would put together some \"Lunch and Learn\" sessions and, and\ntried to explain the philosophy and tried to help people interpret their\nstrengths. And it kind of went along that way for quite a while.\n\nGreg Kirsch 6:24  \n  \nThen, gosh, I don't know, we went along that way for, for quite a while.\nSeveral years ago, Wendy Blackburn, who is our exec in charge of Marcom, she\ncame to me and said, \"Hey, I know that you're really into this, this strength\nthing. Is that something you could do for our clients?\" And I was thinking,\nWell, you know, I'm kind of like a doctor practicing without a license here.\nI, I know a lot about this. And I've got my own kind of interpretation. But I\nsaid, \"Well, let me, let me look into and see what's available.\" And then\ncoupled with that -- with the fact that we had had this really remarkable\ngrowth of 20 to 30% a year, we were also looking for ways to really leverage\nthe strengths work that we had done already.\n\nGreg Kirsch 7:10  \n  \nSo anyway, I went to the website and I think I filled out an inquiry. And I\nthink you actually called me then and, and said, \"Hey, I guess you're\ninterested in being a Certified Coach.\" And I said, \"Yes, I am.\" So you\ndirected me to a couple of options. I ended up going to an [Accelerated\nStrengths Coach](https://courses.gallup.com/courses/strengths/accelerated-\ncoaching-program.html) class in Denver, with Austin and Tim Simon were my,\nwere my instructors, and that --\n\nLindsey Spehn 7:34  \n  \nAwesome, great partners of ours.\n\nGreg Kirsch 7:36  \n  \nYeah, exactly. And so I came back and totally, totally charged up and ready to\ngo and and that's kind of where we are now. So I guess to summarize, in terms\nof our challenge, it's how do we leverage the investment that we've made in\nstrengths? And secondly, how do we stay competitive in a really, in a really\nchallenging environment where we're growing by leaps and bounds? That's really\n-- that's the challenge we are facing.\n\nLindsey Spehn 8:06  \n  \nRight. Yeah, I know, Greg, you've told me just in our conversations over the\nyears, just how, how competitive your industry is, and staying competitive\ncertainly is a key factor. I think you've mentioned that voluntary turnover in\nyour industry is upwards of 20%. So I know that you've specifically found\nstrengths to be a key piece to that.\n\nGreg Kirsch 8:27  \n  \nAbsolutely. Yeah. When we, when we, when we get to the impact part, yes, I,\nour turnover is significantly lower than that. And at least part of that has\nto be credited to the fact that our culture focuses on strengths.\n\nLindsey Spehn 8:41  \n  \nMm hmm. Absolutely. So as we kind of bring the story along, you leave that\ncertification course. What happened then?\n\nGreg Kirsch 8:48  \n  \nWell, I came back, you know, Positivity is No. 2, so I'm totally enthusiastic\nand I'm trying to sell this to anybody that will buy it. I -- totally pumped\nup. I went to Christy, my boss, who is our exec in charge of HR. The L&D team\nthat I manage as part of the bigger HR team. And I said, \"Hey, I've just been\ncertified in strengths. Let me take our team through a strengths journey.\" And\nshe said, \"That would be great. We need to do a team-building exercise.\" So I\ntook the HR team, which was probably about 15, 18 people at the time. And we\ndid a team session where we talked about individual strengths, and we printed\nout everybody's individual strengths profiles and their insight reports and\ngave them all highlighters and asked him to highlight the parts that were most\nresonant with them. We kind of interpreted those, had people talk about their\nstrengths. And then we kind of branched into a strengths-based partnership\nsession where we paired people up and gave them other people's strengths,\ninsights and said, highlight those areas that really resonate with you about\nthe person that you're, you're analyzing here.\n\nGreg Kirsch 9:58  \n  \nAnd it was, it was really a very empowering session. We filled out little\ncards: Here's what you bring to the team; Here's, here's how you can help the\nteam; Here's how the team can help you. We put little stickers of metaphorical\npictures of what you represent to the team on card; I actually still have my\ncard. And when I'm down, I pull it out and look at it just as kind of a, you\nknow, as a affirmation tool. But it was real successful, everybody loved it,\nand, you know, took their strengths tents with their strengths on them and put\nthem outside their, their cubicles in their their offices. And it was, it was\ngreat.\n\nGreg Kirsch 10:35  \n  \nSo Christy came to me later and said, \"Hey, listen, that was great what you\ndid for the HR team. Could you do the same for the executive team?\" And so I\nsaid, \"Wow, yeah, sure. I would love to!\" So I went to New York for one of\ntheir periodic meetings, and did a very similar thing for the 11 people on the\nexecutive committee. And a similar kind of response: People responded\nfavorably. There was a lot of laughs and people, you know, liked it a lot. And\nso that was great. That led to an invitation to do a similar thing for the\nentire VP group. So at the time, this is about 3 years ago, there were\nprobably 50 people in the VP group. So I wasn't able to do the stickers and\nall that; that was that was too cumbersome. But we did a lot of the exercises\nthat you'd be familiar with: love, crazy, envy; we did a scavenger hunt; we --\neverybody was roaming around learning everybody else's strengths. And it was\njust a real empowering session and then, then the floodgates kind of opened\nbecause many VPs started coming to me, saying, \"Can you do this for my team?\nYou know, my team could really use something like this. And what else do you\nhave to offer?\"\n\nGreg Kirsch 11:48  \n  \nSo then suddenly, I -- my Influencing was on steroids at that point because it\nwas out of control. So luckily, there was a woman on a different team who was\nvery interested in strengths, and she asked me how to become a Certified\nStrengths Coach. And her name is Ann; she eventually joined my team to be part\nof the L&D team. And another member of our team, Jasmine, has become a\nCertified Strengths Coach in the meantime. So the three of us are, we're\npretty much handling the demand now. We're able to do strengths for teams; do\na lot of Strengths for Team sessions. Jasmine and Ann also lead our Strengths\nfor New Hire sessions. And so all new employees that join the company -- and\nwe're still experiencing some pretty dramatic growth -- all new employees go\nthrough what we call Strengths for New Hires. And they get, they get the\nstrengths code; they get their assessment. We make a, we make a strengths card\nthat they can put outside their, their cubicle. They look at their insights\nand they learn why we focus on strengths and what the benefits to the\nindividual is and what the benefits to the company are. So that's pretty much\nwhere we're at with strengths.\n\nLindsey Spehn 13:06  \n  \nYeah, I love that. You know, when I work with organizations of really all\nsizes and all industries, it's, it's not honestly that common that we're going\nfrom zero to 100, right, in the journey of strengths. It's not actually very\ncommon that no one knows their strengths one day, and then everyone knows\ntheir strengths, day 2. So what I love about your story, Greg, is that, you\nknow, you started really intentionally with some smaller groups, and, as you\ndescribed very well, you know, word caught on and energy is just, you know,\ncontagious at that point. And people hear about this; they, you know, hear the\nbuzz about strengths and then it kind of happens at a more organic level. So I\nlove that piece of your story.\n\nLindsey Spehn 13:51  \n  \nAs you look back at, you know, maybe when that was all happening, can you\nthink of anything specifically that people really latched on to -- what was\nkind of the key factor around strengths that drew people in and got people\nexcited?\n\nGreg Kirsch 14:05  \n  \nI'd have to say it's, it's probably -- it's such a positive message. And, like\nI said, my own journey was such that throughout my whole early career, I was\nbeing told all the things that I did wrong and all the things that I couldn't\ndo. But this is the total opposite philosophy. It's, it's here's what's right\nabout you. And I think when I am leading teams through this or coaching\nindividuals, that's what I really like to focus on is that positive aspect. It\nshouldn't surprise you: Positivity is my second strength. So it's easy for me\nto do that. But I think that's the message that really resonates with people:\nthat here's, here's what's right about you. Let's leverage that. Let's not try\nto fix what's wrong about you or what's not a strength; let's leverage around\nthat. Let's really focus on what you do well, and how you can,how you can do\nthat to be more productive.\n\nLindsey Spehn 14:56  \n  \nYeah, it just kind of at that point becomes a common language. And it's not\nabout judgment, you know, what, how you're different in what you bring to the\ntable. It's more of a positive mindset about how can we honor those\ndifferences in each other and really partner strategically in that way? So I\nlove that. Absolutely. And then when you think about some of those first\nsessions that you did, you mentioned that very first session, and then good\nenough to be invited to speak with the executive team, which says a lot about\nyou. That's awesome. Can you think about any specific resources or things that\nyou learned in that certification course that helped you in those beginning\ncourses or sessions?\n\nGreg Kirsch 15:38  \n  \nSure. There is a, there's a presentation that was on the Learning Center that\nI, I downloaded, and I adapted it for our own use; part of it applied and part\nof it didn't apply. And it was, you know, frankly, I pretty much followed the\nscript that I learned in training. I adapted it for us. Some things I thought,\nOh, this would never work here. So I didn't try it. Other things, Hey, I'll\ntry it. And if it works great, and if it doesn't work, well then, I'll learn\nthat. Mainly the, the presentation and the, the meetings you should have with\nmanagers and then the, the sessions with teams.\n\nGreg Kirsch 16:18  \n  \nSo what we're doing right now is we basically have 4 sessions with teams.\nWe've got the first one, which is just Discover Your Strengths. Understand\nwhat your strengths are, and we really focus on the individual. Then the\nsecond meeting we have, or the second session we have, is strengths-based\npartnerships. Now that you've kind of understood your own strengths, and you\ncan name them and claim them, understand how they manifest themselves in your\nlife and actually aim them at very specific challenges or goals that you have.\nNow that you've, you've, we've gotten you taken care of from an individual\nstandpoint, now start to learn your teammates' strengths. How can you leverage\ntheir strengths? And in fact, my own team is a good example of that.\n\nGreg Kirsch 16:55  \n  \nI'm high in the Influencing themes and, you know, Positivity and Maximizer --\nor Positivity, I guess, is a [Relationship\nBuilding](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253736/cliftonstrengths-\ndomains.aspx#ite-260150) thing. But the Communication and the Maximizer; Woo\nis way up there. So I'm out there selling all the time. But a lot of times I\nhave a hard time getting things done. So that's where it's really important\nthat I can, can partner with someone like Jasmine on my team, who's very [high\nin the Executing\nthemes](http://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253736/cliftonstrengths-\ndomains.aspx#ite-253169). And that's what I'm talking about when I talk about\na partnership. We complement each other. Ann kind of rounds it out because\nshe's really high [in the\nThinking](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/253736/cliftonstrengths-\ndomains.aspx#ite-260156), so, so she'll think of it, I'll go sell it and\nJasmine will go make it happen is pretty much the way that it works.\n\nLindsey Spehn 17:34  \n  \nLove it! The Power of 3 is what we call that. I love that.\n\nGreg Kirsch 17:36  \n  \nYes, exactly. Then we we move on then to some team, some kind of collective\nStrengths of the Team sessions, where we look at the collective strengths of\nthe teams, how -- what do you as a team bring and how do you get your work\ndone and how can you be more effective leveraging the strengths of your\nindividual team? So that's, that's pretty much the cadence that we've been\nfollowing.\n\nLindsey Spehn 18:01  \n  \nGot it. And so, I guess, looking ahead then to the next step in your journey,\nI know it was about a year ago, Greg, that you and I first talking -- we\nfirst, you know, sort of speaking about layering in our [Q12 employee\nengagement tool](https://q12.gallup.com). So do you want to tell our listeners\na little bit more about how that came to be?\n\nGreg Kirsch 18:19  \n  \nSure. Ironically, at that, that meeting with the VPs that I was just talking\nabout a second ago, after my, after my session, Mary, one of our HR business\npartners in, in our Chicago office, was giving an update on what was going on\nin the HR world. And she mentioned that we are considering doing an engagement\nsurvey, just kind of by way of an update. And we're vetting companies right\nnow. And I saw that Gallup Q12 was on the list. So as soon as the session was\nover, I tackled Mary. And I said, \"Hey, if we -- I'd love to be on this task\nforce!\" And she said, \"I'd love the help!\" And so we vetted a number of\norganizations; settled on the Q12; sold it in, and, and it was, it was\nadopted. So you're right. It was just about a year ago, just a little over a\nyear ago that we launched our first survey of the Q12. Prior to that, we\nidentified 5 people, including myself and Mary, to, to be -- to go through\ncertification training. Well actually, I guess it's not certification\ntraining, but to get our certificate in, in the Q12.\n\nLindsey Spehn 19:28  \n  \nThe Engagement Champion training.\n\nGreg Kirsch 19:30  \n  \nThank you. The Engagement Champion training. So we went through that, and it\nwas a lot to absorb. It was a totally new way for us to do things. So we came\nback and we met and we were nervous and called Mike McDonald, Dr. Mike, our,\nour workplace consultant and probably drove him nuts with all the questions we\nhad, but he actually gave us a series of webinars and video calls to kind of\ncalm our nerves. So anyway, we finally launched it in March and felt pretty\ngood about, you know, the way everything turned out. We -- so now we have\nstrengths working for us. And we're also -- we just last fall conducted our\nsecond wave, our second survey, and, you know, we're, we're making progress.\n\nLindsey Spehn 20:20  \n  \nSo what was that specifically about the Q12 that you think brought value to\nwhat you're already doing with strengths?\n\nGreg Kirsch 20:28  \n  \nWell, they're very synergistic. The, you know, the whole concept of strengths\nis to be, to use, you know, my, my talents, so that I can be more productive,\nuse it so that I can be more, more engaged at work. And that's what the Q12 is\nreally all about is engagement. In fact, I think the third question is, \"At\nwork, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.\" But that's,\nthat's what strengths really are: At work, I have the opportunity to do what I\ndo best. I love my job because I have the opportunity to use my Communication\nskills. I have the opportunity to make things better with Maximizer. I'm, I'm\nkind of a cheerleader for the team using my Positivity, and I can look ahead\nand see what's coming as far as Futuristic and Strategic. So I have found the\nrole -- my role is, I kind of fashioned it around my strengths, and -- which\nmakes me engaged. And that's really what the [Q12 measures is your\nengagement](https://q12.gallup.com). So, so they really work hand in hand.\nIt's really nice.\n\nLindsey Spehn 21:30  \n  \nSo let's, let's break that down just a little bit for our audience. So you,\nyou talk about -- it was easy, you felt, to get kind of the buy-in around the\nQ12 in the first place, and then you -- pretty soon, I think we crafted a\nstrategy for you and some other key partners you mentioned, to become trained\nengagement champions.\n\nGreg Kirsch 21:48  \n  \nYes.\n\nLindsey Spehn 21:48  \n  \nLet's, let's break down what the next steps looked like in terms of your\napproach to measure engagement.\n\nGreg Kirsch 21:55  \n  \nOK. Well, we came back from our training to become Engagement Champions. And\nagain, like I said, it was -- to be honest, it was a little overwhelming at\nfirst. I mean, there's -- it's a, it's a new way of doing things. But we, we\nmet, we met periodically; mapped out a strategy for who's going to take which\nteams. We engaged Dr. Mike to help us in terms of what do we do first, what do\nwe do next? And again, much like strengths, we kind of followed the script. We\nstarted off with dividing the teams up among the five of us. I think we\nquickly learned that there weren't enough of us for a company the size of\n1,000. And since then, we've gotten another, I think five people have gone\nthrough the training. So we've gotten -- so reinforcements have arrived and\nwe're in much better shape.\n\nGreg Kirsch 22:45  \n  \nBut we conducted, conducted the survey, I -- you know, would you like me to\ntalk a little bit about how we, how we launched the survey? Would that be\nhelpful?\n\nLindsey Spehn 22:54  \n  \nYeah, that'd be great.\n\nGreg Kirsch 22:55  \n  \nWell, we, we wanted to have a high participation rate and so -- because we\nknow how important it is to have everybody participate. We're in a, we're in\nthe communication industry. So making posters and crafting emails comes pretty\nnatural, naturally to us. But we conducted a series of meetings that we hosted\nfrom Kansas City. I think in total, there were eight meetings, where we Zoomed\nthese out to our various other offices; anybody could tune in. And we talked\nabout why we're focusing on engagement, why engagement matters, how engagement\nbenefits the company in terms of increased productivity, and increased loyalty\nand less, less absenteeism and those kind of things. And also how engagement\nbenefits the employee -- from things like lower stress and lower depression\nall the way to (this one kills me) those people who are engaged at work\nactually have lower levels of bad cholesterol, which I thought was\nfascinating.\n\nGreg Kirsch 23:53  \n  \nSo at any rate, a lot of benefits for both the employer and for the employee.\nAnd we, we kind of coined the phrase, \"If we're all engaged, everyone wins.\"\nSo, we, we put this out on posters and sent it out in emails; we conducted\nthese meetings, these eight meetings. And with about 1,000 people -- at the\ntime, it was probably closer to 750 people, maybe 800 people -- but we had\nalmost half of the people in the organization attended one of those meetings.\nSo that was, that was pretty cool. And we were, we were tracking our\nparticipation rate as we rolled out the survey. And we, you know, like I said,\nour goal was to get to 80%. And we were at about 76% with one day to go.\n\nGreg Kirsch 24:40  \n  \nSo Antonio, one of the guys that works out of our Chicago office, suggested,\nhe said, \"Hey, you know, what we ought to do is have a, have a pizza party.\nAnd why don't -- Greg, why don't you send out an email and invite everybody to\nhave a piece of pizza! And the theme behind that one was it's going to take\nyou less time to fill out this survey than it will to eat a piece of pizza. So\nwe, so we sent out a goofy video and sent it out to everybody and had pizza in\nall the different kitchen areas so anybody that wanted to could come take the\nsurvey and have a piece of pizza. We ran out of pizza; everybody showed up.\nBut the bottom line was, it worked. We ended up getting 85% participation rate\nin our first time out of the gate. So we were pretty pleased with that.\n\nLindsey Spehn 25:28  \n  \nYeah, that's awesome. Yeah, I remember you -- you shared that video with me,\nGreg. And I just loved that; I had to share it with my own team. You know,\nwhen I think about one of my favorite parts of my job is getting to see ways\nthat our clients like you really adapt what we have and make it your own. And,\nyou know, as you maybe reflect, before we get into your impact, back into, you\nknow, some of the approaches and strategies that you have just described --\nboth strengths and engagement. You mentioned weaving strengths into your own\nonboarding program. I love that. You know, weaving your own personality into\nbumping up the participation rate. Can you think of any other ways that you\nkind of put the \"Intouch touch\" on some of your strategies that you've rolled\nout beyond the ones that you've shared already?\n\nGreg Kirsch 26:19  \n  \nWell, we've designed our own strengths cards that we put -- that we give to\neverybody; we do them in our team sessions. And we're also making those\navailable to anybody that attends to Strengths for New Hires session. And, you\nknow, again, being within a communication company, we've got our whole group\nthat just does wonderful design and wonderful -- our stuff just looks so good.\nAnd that just adds another kind of touch of professional -- professionalism to\nthem. But boy, you walk around your offices and you can see, I would venture\nto say, more than half; certainly probably close to 65% or 70% of the people\nhave their strengths posted outside their office. We do team sessions and the\ntable tents that we have. People have those hanging over their cubicle walls.\nStrengths has kind of become part of our lexicon. You can hear people talking\nabout it.\n\nGreg Kirsch 27:17  \n  \nSo we've designed our own -- the meetings that I mentioned earlier, put them\nin our own template, put them in our own format. So they look -- they look\nlike they came from Intouch. I think that was pretty important. So those are\nsome of the ways that we've kind of put our own stamp on. Like I said, we\nlooked at what was provided, and much of it was -- most of it was awesome.\nSome of it didn't apply, or some of it didn't feel right, like it fit in with\nour culture. So we kind of threw those out. We've adapted some others. In our\nmost recent session we started using -- you provide some cards, pictures,\nthose metaphorical pictures. Instead of, we've asked people to go pick out a\ncard that represents you and explain why you picked this card to represent\nyou, which has been a real kind of a neat little adaptation. So we keep\nevolving, we keep adapting, we keep changing it. It just -- and it's fun for\nus, too, because as we do it, it's become less. It doesn't become stale. It's\nnot rote. It's it's organic and continues to grow.\n\nLindsey Spehn 28:21  \n  \nSure, and it's yours; you know.\n\nGreg Kirsch 28:23  \n  \nAnd it's ours; that's right.\n\nLindsey Spehn 28:24  \n  \nYou've made it your own. Let's get into impact. So as you think about, you\nknow, all your hard work with you. I know Jasmine and Ann are also key\npartners of yours and your team. What, what are some of the ways that you have\nseen, you know, those approaches take shape within your organization, both\nquantitatively and maybe even qualitatively too?\n\nGreg Kirsch 28:46  \n  \nProbably the biggest -- the biggest quantitative number we have are the\nresults that we've gotten from the Q12. And so I'll probably start off there.\nLike I said, we wanted a high participation rate. We ended up getting 85%.\nAnd, which was great, we were all very pleased with that. Our first survey,\nwhich was done a year ago, our GrandMean was a 4.0. And frankly, I was pretty\nhappy with that, considering it was our first time out of the gate. The Gallup\naverage, I think, is 4.06. And that's for Gallup clients. And so, being, being\nat a 4.0, right out of the gate, you know, being pretty close to what your\naverage client is, some of whom, I presume, have been working with you for\nyears, I felt pretty good about it. We had 45% engagement, which was, again,\nmuch better than the average across the nation, which I think your research\nsays is about 33%.\n\nGreg Kirsch 29:49  \n  \nSo right there, our first engagement scores seemed to indicate that yeah,\nwe've got a relatively engaged workforce -- not solely due to strengths, of\ncourse, because we got a wonderful culture here and a wonderful company. But\ncertainly strengths plays a part in that. So that would be the first thing. We\ndid our second survey in October of this year -- so just last fall. And the\nresults came back, and they were even more gratifying. Our participation rate\njumped up to 92%. So 92% of 1,000 people is pretty remarkable when you think\nabout it. We got 92% participation rate. The GrandMean went up from 4.0 to\n4.07. So we're actually right at, at your average now with all of your\nclients, which is great. Probably the single best metric that we had, though,\nwas our Engaged number. We went from 45% to 50% Engaged. Mike McDonald said\nthat was a huge number. So I believed him. He said, that's literally a 5% more\npeople are -- like what they do and like who they work with. And so that's,\nthat's pretty, that's pretty cool.\n\nGreg Kirsch 31:09\n\nSo I think the very fact that we are doing things like strengths -- again,\nnot, not the sole contributor because we've got so many great cultural things\ngoing on here. We've really doubled down on our culture as a way to deal with\nthis spectacular and rapid growth. And strengths and [the Q12 engagement\nsurvey](https://q12.gallup.com) certainly is a big part of that. Higher engage\n-- excuse me, higher engagement, higher GrandMean, higher participation. So\nfrom a quantitative standpoint, that's, that's one metric. You had mentioned\nour turnover earlier. Advertising is, is -- kind of has a reputation for\nhaving a \"revolving door.\" The, the business churns people through. The number\nthat I most commonly hear is about a 20% annual turnover for people in the\nagency business. Take that number and set it over here for just a minute.\n\nGreg Kirsch 32:08  \n  \nYour research, I think it was [your research, said that about 38% of the\nAmerican workforce are\nmillennials](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238073/millennials-work-\nlive.aspx) \\-- are under the age of 38. So at Intouch, however, our percentage\nof that age cohort is closer to 65%. So we've got a very young company. And\nagain, your research seems to indicate that those -- that that cohort tends to\nchange jobs more frequently. In fact, I think the number -- I think the number\nwas 6 out of 10 people in that age cohort are looking for a new job. So we're\nin a very high-turnover industry. And we've, we've got -- we're, we mainly\nemploy the cohort that changes jobs most frequently.\n\nGreg Kirsch 32:53  \n  \nSo taking those two factors, but if you take a look at our voluntary turnover,\nit's actually very low, considering that we're in the low, low teens -- in the\nlows -- in the low double digits. So compare that with a 20% turnover rate for\nthe industry, that, that says something. Something's going on in terms of our\nculture. And again, I can't say it's only strengths, or it's only the Q12\nengagement and so forth, the strategies that we've employed because of that,\nbut I got to believe that that's played a part.\n\nGreg Kirsch 33:25  \n  \nAnd then one other metric that's tied into that is the fact that we've got is\nour client turnover. Traditionally, clients stay with agencies. Again, I'm not\nsure I've got the most recent figures, but to be safe, let's just say that\nit's in the, it's in the single digits, in terms of years. You know, maybe\nfive, maybe seven, maybe seven years. Our -- this is great. We've been in\nbusiness for 20 years. The company was started in 1999. And we started with\ntwo, with basically with two clients. Those two clients are still with us.\nThey are still clients of ours. And so not only are we retaining our\nemployees, but we're also retaining our clients because of the fabulous client\nservice that we provide and, you know, the fabulous, the fabulous product that\nwe help deliver for them. But they're obviously very happy with this. And part\nof that has to be because we've got lower turnover because we've got an\nengaged workforce. So add it all up and you'll see that we've got an engaged\nworkforce. We've got clients who are sticking with this. We've got employees\nwho are sticking -- staying with us. And I think they all work together.\n\nLindsey Spehn 34:43  \n  \nSure. I think. Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Jim.\n\nJim Collison 34:47  \n  \nNo, let me -- hold on. Based on what something Greg said; and Andrea had asked\nthis question earlier. Greg, based on you'd said earlier about maybe taking\nstrengths or talking about it with your clients.\n\nGreg Kirsch 34:59  \n  \nYes.\n\nJim Collison 34:59  \n  \nHow is that -- you just kind of mentioned that now. How has that, you know,\nhow has that progressed? Or where are you at with that? Or tell me, dig, dig\nin a little bit more on that. How has that worked?\n\nGreg Kirsch 35:11  \n  \nSure. To be perfectly honest, we really haven't pursued that strategy. It was\nan idea that came up and that was kind of the catalyst for me becoming a\nCertified Strengths Coach. But what we've found is, and it's still certainly\nan offering if we wanted to. I have done strengths, in fact, I think, Lindsey,\nyou put me in touch with another organization here in Kansas City that -- talk\nabout a good cultural thing, we allow people a certain amount of time just to\ndo philanthropic things in the in the community. You get, you get paid time\noff just to do philanthropic things. So I use my time to, to go do it with one\nof your other clients that didn't -- that hadn't been certified yet in\nstrengths. So we've we've been able to do it for other people and we've been\nable to share the philosophy with other people.\n\nGreg Kirsch 35:59  \n  \nThe idea of doing it for our clients per se has not, has not taken hold,\nalthough now I feel -- whereas before I didn't feel qualified to do it because\nI felt like, like I said, a doctor practicing without a license. I feel very\nqualified to do that now if the need would arise.\n\nJim Collison 36:17  \n  \nLet me let me also ask this. Nate asked this question: Was there anything\nwithin Intouch that prepared the culture for the rapid adoption of strengths?\n\nGreg Kirsch 36:26  \n  \nWe're a very entrepreneurial kind of company; we were started by an\nentrepreneur. Faruk Capan started the company 20 years ago, you know, in his,\nin his basement. Had an idea that maybe this internet thing might catch on, I\ndon't know. So, and obviously it did. So we value, we value innovation. We\nvalue people taking initiative, it's kind of one of our core values. So the\nfact that I was able to kind of be an entrepreneur in that sense -- or maybe a\nbetter term would be an intrapreneur; I was able to build this internally. The\ncompany culture itself rewards that. So that, that was something that was\nreally going in my favor. The fact that people were open to it; people are\nopen to change; people are open to trying new things. And if it doesn't work,\nit doesn't work. And we'll move on. In fact, when I first became a Strengths\nCoach, one of the conversations I had with Christy was, she said, \"Well, let's\ngive this a year. And if it doesn't work, we'll move on to something else.\" I\nsaid, \"Great.\" So a very, a very open company in terms of new ideas. Well,\nwe'll try anything. And, you know, and if it works great, and if it doesn't,\nwe'll move on to the next thing.\n\nJim Collison 37:42  \n  \nYeah, certainly helpful. Lindsey, in your work, how important it is to have\nsomebody like Greg, who's in it, live in it. I mean, how important is that?\nSponsor, stakeholder, whatever you want to call it. Can you talk a little bit\nabout that and how you've seen Greg work. He can talk about it, but sometimes\nit's nice when we hear it from somebody else as well.\n\nLindsey Spehn 37:59  \n  \nYeah, absolutely. Well, as you all have heard, I mean, Greg just has this\namazing \"Get it factor\" \\-- is what we call it at Gallup. So he from the\nbeginning realized, you know, it was not going to be an overnight culture\nchange; that it was going to take some hard work, some investment. As you've\nheard, he's relied on our data, our colleagues and experts along the way. And\nI think it's just so huge to have a key champion like Greg.\n\nLindsey Spehn 38:27  \n  \nOne other piece I would just add to what, Greg, you just shared around, you\nknow, how were you able to get it to catch on so quickly. We know that one of\nthe very first key pieces in creating a strengths-based culture, from a best\npractice standpoint, is to get leadership engaged pretty quickly. As much as\nwe have, you know, great champions within the organization, we know that it\nwon't really take flight in a big way to make it, you know, truly impactful\norganizationwide without that leadership support pretty soon in the beginning.\nAnd so, I think what was really key was for you to actually meet with that\nexecutive team, you know, your, your peers and fellow leaders pretty early on.\nBecause I think once they are able to learn more about their strengths, and\nhave you teach them a little bit more about what this could look like and get\na little taste of it, I think from there, we just see that catch on. You\ncan't, you can't help but feel the excitement after a session like that. So I\nthink that was really smart -- to credit you -- in the, in the beginning and\nyour partners to start with that type of group for one of the very first\nsessions.\n\nGreg Kirsch 39:33  \n  \nOh, thank you. I -- it's kind of fun. The -- it's become part of our lexicon\nnow. In fact, if you walk by the, the C-Suite, row of offices, Faruk has his\nstrengths outside his office, and Wendy has them outside her office; Christy\nhas them outside her office. Chris Sherling, our CFO, has them outside his off\n-- I was talking with Chris the other day. And I forget what the topic was. I\nwas probably over budget on something, I don't know. But, but Chris said,\nWell, you know, [Competition] is in my Top 5. So you know that, you know. And\nit was just -- that just kind of warmed my heart to know that it's just become\npart of our lexicon. People are talking about it. So -- and that's kind of\nanother, you asked about impact. That's another element of impact. It's, it's\njust, it's not totally there yet. We're still, we're still pushing and\nprodding and selling and evangelizing whenever we can. But yeah, it's, it, I\nthink your point is well taken. That getting that buy-off at the top certainly\nmade, made the climb a lot easier.\n\nJim Collison 40:44  \n  \nJustin out in the chat room asked Greg, you mentioned the industry standard\nfor clients to stay with their agency is around 5 to 7 years. How do you think\nIntouch compares to that now?\n\nGreg Kirsch 40:53  \n  \nWell, I only anecdotally. I'm off to the side now that since I'm not really\ndealing with our clients as much anymore, and I'm really more of an internal\nresource. I got to believe it's more than that. Because, and again, I don't\nhave a number. I don't have a hard number and I'd be scared to mention one. I\ndo know that like I said, our two longest-tenured clients have been with us\nfor 20 years. So, by definition, they're going to skew the, the average higher\nthan that. I, I probably could find that number. And, in fact, I could get\nback with you guys if you wanted to share with Justin later. I don't have the\nnumber off the top of my head.\n\nJim Collison 41:33  \n  \nSure, sure. No, and I think, you know, we hear this all the time, is customers\nwill say, Well, we just really like working with you guys. Like it creates a\nculture of, of -- internally where people are kinder to each other; where\npeople really are -- they work better in partnerships. They get things done\nmore efficiently. You're probably seeing that as teams start working better\ntogether, right? They stop trying to sabotage each other and they start trying\nto figure out how to help one another. Because they know their success is tied\ntogether. Do you see, as it gets, as it gets communicated more -- and even\nwith the engagement number, right, we can measure the effects of strengths\nthat's having in an organization with the engagement survey. Do you sense an\noverall movement like that inside the organization? Did you see it become a\nmore helpful, more productive? Could you feel that and could you see it as it\nwas happening?\n\nGreg Kirsch 42:23  \n  \nYeah, I think the answer to that is \"Yes.\" You can see it happening even more.\nWell, again, let's go back to a quantitative measure. The company has always\nbeen a very caring company, as long as I've been here, since 2008. And even in\nface of this dramatic growth, we haven't lost our -- that human touch.\nQuestion, I think is question number 5, \"At work, my supervisor or someone at\nwork cares about me as a person.\" That is our single highest Q12 score. And,\nand you can see that in the organization. It's just a very caring\norganization.\n\nJim Collison 43:03  \n  \nThat is some -- that's some great insight to see that question and then to\npoint that right back to a definite culture. You know, in other words, this\nreflects our culture. And it's a great measurement of that, and I think gives\nyou the opportunity to also to celebrate that in the organization. We say\nthat, you know, in other words, as an organization, we say that, but is it\nproven out in the numbers when we survey our employees? Do they believe in it\nas well? And so it's not -- you're just not making it up. It actually is true\nbased on the numbers, right?\n\nGreg Kirsch 43:32  \n  \nYeah. And we know, I mean, we know, when people are engaged, they, they like\ntheir jobs better. I mean, they, they want to go to work, and they're going to\nprovide better client service. And like you said, they're going to treat\ntheir, their teammates better. And it's, it's, it's this virtuous cycle. If I\ncan, if I can get somebody -- if I can empower them by focusing on what's\nright with them, and then they become more engaged at work. So they, they\nstart treating their coworkers better and start treating their clients better.\nAnd like you said, Jim, then the clients say, \"We just like working with you\nguys.\" And so it just and boy, if you like working with me, I like working\nwith you. So I'm gonna work harder! And it just, it just keeps going around\nlike that. I, you know, it's hard to quantify, but I got to believe there's\nsomething there.\n\nJim Collison 44:17  \n  \nYeah. No. Lindsay, what else do you have for us?\n\nLindsey Spehn 44:19  \n  \nYeah, Greg, I'd be curious to know, what are some ways that you and, and\nJasmine, your other trained Champions, your fellow coaches, how do you stay\nsharp in your role?\n\nGreg Kirsch 44:28  \n  \nOh, great question. Well, we, we meet periodically, and we, we share things.\nProbably one of the, one of the best things we've done is we -- I went to the\nSummit that you provided a couple of years ago. And I was kind of a neophyte,\nand I was roaming around. I didn't know anybody, other than I did run into\nsome of the people that, you know, had attended my [Accelerated Strengths\nCoaching class](https://courses.gallup.com/courses/strengths/accelerated-\ncoaching-program.html), which was fun. And I, boy, I just, I just absorbed a\nlot of stuff. I just -- it was like, it was like drinking from a firehose,\nthere was so much. I downloaded every single presentation afterwards and put\nthem in a file, so that I could, I could, you know, refer to them.\n\nGreg Kirsch 45:10  \n  \nAnd then last year, I convinced a couple of my cohorts to go with me, or my\ncompatriots to go with me, and they did, and the three of us then started, you\nknow, then we were able to branch out a little bit more. And we all mapped out\nour, mapped out our sessions. Which one are we going to? I'll go to this one;\nyou go to that one. Let's get back together. Let's compare notes. And so that\nwas great. I'm hoping to get even more people to go to the summit this year. I\n-- you talked about last year's summit. The book that had just been published,\n[_It 's the Manager_](https://store.gallup.com/p/en-us/12605/it%27s-the-\nmanager), it had just been published. And so I got a copy -- everybody got a\ncopy, but I bought a copy for the CEO; I bought one for one of our, David, our\n-- one of our enterprise leaders. Bought one for Christy, trying to, you know,\njust, Hey, you should read this. You should read this. Use it as a reference\nbook.\n\nGreg Kirsch 45:59  \n  \nAnd one of the things that we had decided as a business imperative is try to,\nwell, the broader imperative is to make Intouch a better place to work. And as\npart of that, I had suggested that we need to teach, we need to teach our\nemployees, or our managers, really, how to be coaches. How to be a coach, as\nopposed to a manager. And your research suggests that with the changing\nworkforce, as the, as the workforce is turning over, today's workforce don't\nwant a boss, they want a manager. They don't want a, you know, they don't want\na paycheck; they want a purpose. These kinds of things.\n\nGreg Kirsch 46:33  \n  \nAnd so we've really invested, pretty much like I said earlier, we've doubled\ndown on this cultural idea that we need to, we need to change the way that\nwe're doing -- although the company just started from such a great base\nalready. But let's, let's start to invest in coaching. Let's start to develop\nthis culture of coaching. I, as you mentioned, in my bio, I've actually\ndecided to become a Certified Professional Coach. So that -- and we're\nlaunching a coaching initiative internally to help those, those high\nperformers become even better. And my background as a Strengths Coach is only\ngoing to enhance that; it's only going to really add to it. So -- actually, I\ngot off on a roll and I forgot your original question. But we're, we're trying\nto develop a coaching culture here. And again, the company has been very open\nto that.\n\nLindsey Spehn 47:29  \n  \nYeah. We were just talking about how you stay sharp as coaches. I know\nsummit's been a key thing that you and others have prioritized within Intouch\nin attending. It's a good, always a good reunion point for your fellow ASC\ncourse attendees too.\n\nGreg Kirsch 47:43  \n  \nExactly, yeah, yeah, it is fun. And it's fun to meet people there. You've\nintroduced me to several folks that I've met and, and then actually run into\npeople that I didn't even know were coaches that I knew from a previous life,\nthat were there. So yeah, it's been kind of fun to reconnect with people.\n\nLindsey Spehn 48:00  \n  \nThat's great.\n\nJim Collison 48:00  \n  \nLindsey, we probably have time for just one more question from you. What would\nyou like to kind of wrap it with?\n\nLindsey Spehn 48:06  \n  \nYeah, let's, let's end with this one, Greg. So if you knew then, back when you\nstarted with the strengths rollout, if you knew then what you know, now, what\nwould you have changed?\n\nGreg Kirsch 48:19  \n  \nWell, gee, I don't -- things have worked out pretty well. So I probably, well,\nhere's what I would have changed. I would have become a Strengths Coach much\nsooner, if I'd only known it was available, I was unaware that I could become\na Strengths Coach. And I probably would have done that. When I came back from\nmy Accelerated Strengths Coaching, I was pretty much willing to talk to\nanybody that would listen. You know, it's like, \"I'm going to have a strengths\nsession.\" and they'd say, \"What time?\" I'd go, \"What time can you be there?\"\nYou know, I, I would really just talk to whoever wanted to talk to me about\nit.\n\nGreg Kirsch 48:53  \n  \nAnd so, yeah, I guess my advice would be, start -- there's different\nstrategies. You know, have it just kind of happen grassroots level and\norganically. I kind of did that kind of strategy. But I also kind of did a\npull strategy as well, when I got the, the executive team bought in. Then it\nbecame much, much easier. So I guess having to do it all over again, maybe get\n-- I will tell you, from an engagement standpoint, I think we started off with\ntoo few Engagement Champions for a company our size. And I think we were a bit\noverwhelmed coming out of the gate. So I might suggest getting more Engagement\nChampions involved. The very first time out of the gate with our engagement\ninitiative, I think the Engagement Champions tried to take on too much. And so\nI would suggest that we try to influence our managers to take on more of that\nresponsibility.\n\nLindsey Spehn 49:52  \n  \nSure. Thank you. Well, what I personally really like about this success story\nis two things -- just to kind of credit you, Greg, and your team. One is, you\nknow, from the beginning, your huge commitment to it. As Jim mentioned, you\nknow, the having a partner like you is really, really key to having this\nreally take off and catch on in a big way, and, most importantly, make that\nimpact that you mentioned from a quantitative engagement standpoint and in the\nvalue you bring to your customers.\n\nLindsey Spehn 50:19  \n  \nSecond is, as I mentioned already, you know, how you've made all of our tools,\nGallup's expertise, how you've made it your own. You know, we find that\nthere's actually a 7% increase in employee engagement after just simply doing\nthe CliftonStrengths assessment. But then when you truly create more of a\nculture and have intentional touchpoints around coaching and manager\ndevelopment -- all the great things that you're mentioning that you've\ndeveloped with your fellow trained coaches -- we see a 23% increase in\nemployee engagement. So that's what the data says. And that's certainly what\nyou have done very, very well. So, Greg, with that, I just want to thank you\nagain on behalf of the Gallup tribe for, for joining us today and sharing your\nsuccess story. I know, I personally am incredibly grateful to be along for the\nride. And I'm excited to see where this heads.\n\nGreg Kirsch 51:11  \n  \nYeah, me too. Well, thanks for having me. It was a lot of fun.\n\nJim Collison 51:14  \n  \nAppreciate it, Greg. With that will remind everyone to take advantage of all\nof our resources. Greg mentioned a ton of them, and they're using a lot of\nthem. Now on our new Gallup Access platform, you just head over to\n[gallup.com/cliftonstrengths](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths).

So what is the disconnect?\n\nBy: [HRM Asia Newsroom](https://hrmasia.com/author/hrmasia/ \"Posts by HRM Asia\nNewsroom\") | March 17, 2020\n\nTopics: [Digital Transformation](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/digital-\ntransformation/) | [Features](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/features/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/hrtechnology/) |\n[Leadership](https://hrmasia.com/category/topics/leadership/)\n\n_Tom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/83424484_m.jpg)\n\nInjecting new or updated technology into the human resource realm is no recent\nphenomenon; employers have been tweaking their HR-tech solutions for two\ndecades or more. From client-server to cloud-native platforms, the spending\nand the effort on tech improvements are not in dispute\u2014but their effectiveness\nmay be.\n\nAccording to HR-tech guru Josh Bersin, in his _HR Technology 2019 Market:\nDisruption Ahead_ report, more than 12 million U.S. employers are spending\nover US$5 trillion on payroll, benefits and other employee programs annually.\nBersin reports that, with more than 40% of the U.S. workforce changing jobs\nannually, the result is a US$250 billion-plus market just for products related\nto recruitment, advertisement, assessment and interviewing.\n\nUnfortunately, despite all that spending, it appears that results lag\nexpectations and outcomes. According to recent research from Raven Intel and\nthe International Association for Human Resource Information Management, HR\nleaders report their tech projects continue to disappoint in the all-important\nsuccess quotient.\n\nThe _2019 IHRIM HR Software Study_ , executed by Raven, found that, of the 230\nHR professionals surveyed involved in tech projects, just 38% said the project\ndelivered \u201call\u201d of the expected business value. More than half (53%) report\ngetting \u201csome of the value,\u201d with 6% saying they got no value and 3% actually\nfeeling they \u201cwent backwards.\u201d In addition, 47% report no cost savings.\n\nConducted in September, the survey asked participants for feedback on a cross-\nsection of projects implemented in the past two years, including HCM/core HR,\ntalent management (learning, performance, compensation and career goals),\nrecruiting, onboarding and payroll.\n\n**Why the Disconnect?**\n\nThe survey results are very similar to what Raven Intel is hearing from\ncustomers, said Bonnie Duncan Tinder, founder and CEO of Raven, which helps\nenterprise software customers independently find the best implementation\npartner.\n\nTinder said her firm sees the highest risk for failure when the buyer doesn\u2019t\ndo its due diligence in choosing a partner\u2014for instance, perhaps it went with\na firm suggested by the software vendor or a partner that had been used by\nanother internal team.\n\n\u201cThey chose the path of least resistance; they didn\u2019t put in the time and\neffort on that partner selection that they put into choosing the software,\u201d\nshe said. In fairness, she noted, sometimes by the time HR leaders have\ncompleted a grueling software-selection process, they may be so tired that the\nidea of slapping a partner onto the project to \u201cmake it easy\u201d can become a\ntrap\u2014in terms of realizing successful outcomes.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have that second critical piece [of the right partner], it\ndoesn\u2019t matter how good the software is,\u201d Tinder said. \u201cYou can get the best\nproduct on the market and spend millions of dollars. But if you don\u2019t have the\nright project partner and the right project plan, it\u2019s going to fail.\u201d\n\nJeanne Achille, chair of the Select HR Tech Conference, said that, in the\npast, the adage \u201cMeasure twice, cut once\u201d was enough for making an HR-tech\ninvestment. Today, she said, the accelerated, intensively competitive pace of\nglobal business continuously creates multiple, highly dynamic requirements.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, to ensure success, organizations need to deploy well-designed\nsolutions that can accommodate the inevitable: change,\u201d Achille said.\n\nJason Averbook, industry analyst and co-founder and CEO of Leapgen, a\nconsulting and education firm that works with HR organizations globally, isn\u2019t\nshy about offering up his reasons behind the all-too-common disconnect\nsurrounding goals and results with HR tech: \u201cHR has pinned its hopes on\ntechnology as a \u2018digital holy grail,\u2019 and it keeps trying to make simple tools\ncatch up to what I call the \u2018now of work,\u2019 rather than devising new\nstrategies,\u201d Averbook explained.\n\nWhen unaddressed, he adds, this disconnect prevents organizations from\nachieving meaningful, sustained transformation of the HR/people function,\nworkforce experience and business.\n\n\u201cThe world outside has outpaced life inside work,\u201d Averbook explained. \u201cThis\nmatters because we\u2019re not unleashing the full potential and power of people,\nwho are digital and modern and innovative\u2014or want to be.\u201d Organizations that\nharness and unleash this potential will gain competitive edge, drive loyalty\nand workforce engagement, and extend more value to customers, he added.\n\n**Three Stumbling Blocks\u2014And Steps for Success**\n\nScot Marcotte, chief technology officer at Buck\u2014an HR and benefits consulting,\ntechnology, and administration-services firm\u2014sees the biggest stumbling blocks\nwith any new HR-tech project as threefold: overly complicated goals (expecting\nmore than the solution can deliver), patchwork solutions that aren\u2019t fully\nintegrated with existing technologies and the wrong person in the decision-\nmaker driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMarcotte offers a few practical steps to tackle the disconnect challenge.\n\nFirst, HR must base decisions on evidence. Before investing in any new HR\ntechnology, Marcotte said, companies need to first step back and use data to\ndetermine their HR objectives. Executives should think carefully about what\nthey want the software to accomplish based on the needs of the business and\ntheir employees, who deliver on those needs. For instance, benefits and\nrewards platforms can use data from the firm\u2019s own health, wealth, career and\nengagement sources, enabling HR and finance to apply analytics to establish a\n\u201ctalent baseline\u201d of health, performance, engagement and rewards.\n\n\u201cWith clear baselines, explicit goals and people analytics, the business can\nbest model people scenarios effectively and gain the insight needed to\nidentify the underlying health and wellbeing issues and the potential\ntechnology solutions,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nNext, ensure new and existing systems mesh seamlessly. From workforce planning\nto talent-acquisition systems, and from payroll to performance-management\nplatforms, he said, there are often up to 20 different components in a\ncomplete HR-technology system. Often, the solution needed isn\u2019t a complete\noverhaul.\n\n\u201cExisting technology investments can be leveraged if those systems can provide\nbaseline and ongoing metrics and can integrate with the other technology in\nplace,\u201d Marcotte said.\n\nFinally, collaborate on the software decision. According to Marcotte, too\noften, IT takes the lead in selecting technology, since that department must\nensure that HR software can be rationalized against other technology goals of\nthe company\u2014including cost\u2014and compatibility with other systems. Because HR\nhas the clearest picture of talent needs through its analytics, however, HR\nleaders should instead be in the driver\u2019s seat to identify what\u2019s working and\nwhat\u2019s not, where replacement is needed or consolidation is in order, and when\nthe time is right to bring change into HR service delivery.\n\n\u201cGiven the high cost of technology investment, it\u2019s critical that HR and IT\nwork together to assure software decisions make business\u2014and people\u2014sense,\u201d he\nsaid.\n\n**\u2018Less is More\u2019**\n\nAnother misstep, adds Jonathan Sears, Americas People Advisory Services\nTechnology leader at EY\u2014the multinational professional-services firm\nheadquartered in London\u2014happens when employers look to technology to solve all\nof their people, capability and process issues in a single implementation.\n\n\u201cThey are making a mistake because it\u2019s simply not possible,\u201d Sears said. \u201cIn\nmany ways, the technology is irrelevant if you\u2019re not looking at the skills\nand capabilities of your people, and the processes in which your work is\ncompleted. New technology plus old process equals an expensive, old process.\u201d\n\nEffective change management and learning represent two related key success\nvariables, Sears explains, and that means knowing how to enable a workforce to\nadopt the new technology, and measuring the readiness and effectiveness of the\nnew technology across the organization.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the data has shown that those organizations that invest in\nchange-management activities have a much higher success rate from those who\ndon\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\nSears said traditional change management (e.g. training) has proven to be\nlimiting in its effectiveness, and organizations have pivoted to tracking\nemployee sentiment, business readiness and adoption, and ROI through digital\nchange-experience tools, while also deploying high-end learning simulations\nand knowledge-capture tools to effectively change the way people work.\n\nRaven Intel\u2019s Tinder offers another roadblock in attaining a smooth,\nsuccessful outcome from an HR-tech project: People making the decisions often\nare not around long enough to see the original plan through. That disruption,\nwhether it be with the HR leadership or the third-party implementation\npartner, can drive a project into failure mode.\n\n\u201cThe people leading a project can change and, all of a sudden, the thing that\nyou thought was really important never materialized within the project,\u201d\nTinder said, adding that, with that possibility always looming, taking a \u201cless\nis more\u201d approach is a good idea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing the fewer things that you can really do well within the\nproduct and project,\u201d she said. \u201cThose are the people who are realizing all\nthe value and really are most successful on a project.\u201d\n\nSometimes, when things seem to be going awry during planning stages, it might\nmake sense to step back and reevaluate the need in the first place.\n\nFor example, Sears said, you\u2019re not ready to invest and implement new\ntechnology if you\u2019re not taking a few key steps: eliminating unnecessary\nprocesses, outsourcing work to your ecosystem of vendor partners,\nstandardizing and simplifying key activities and processes, and automating\nwhat\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cReal change comes from your willingness to evolve your operating model,\npeople, capabilities and processes,\u201d he said. \u201cTechnology is, simply, the\nenablement layer of all of the above.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Leapgen\u2019s Averbook said, most employers have come to recognize the\nurgency and increased importance of considering employee experience\u2014and\nexpectation\u2014and the technological possibilities for deploying truly holistic,\nend-to-end digital workplaces, he said. But getting there seems easier said\nthan done.\n\n\u201cSustained, meaningful transformation requires a change to mindset, people,\nprocess and technology,\u201d Averbook said. \u201cA technology transition alone won\u2019t\ncut it. \u201c\n\nTo Averbook, employers are content to buy and implement technology, rather\nthan design its deployment to match workforce capabilities.\n\n\u201cWe hack it, rip and replace it, and call it \u2018transformation,\u2019 when we\u2019re\ndoing nothing more than a lift and shift from one piece of technology to\nanother,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the disconnect: We\u2019re implementing, but\nwe\u2019re not _really_ deploying.\u201d\n\nAverbook said HR leaders in the past have been afraid of technology, or have\nconsidered it to be more in the realm of IT. Instead, modern HR should\nunderstand that true deployment of HR technology requires creating and owning\na digital strategy\u2014understanding how people work and putting a strategy in\nplace to best activate the workforce.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the role of the people function,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the job of IT to\ncome up with that strategy.\u201d\n\nIn short, he adds, the people function needs to embrace the strategy\u2014including\nunderstanding the mindset shift required to implement it, remixing processes\nto support the experience and choosing the technology that best fuels all of\nit.\n\n\u201cA technology plan is not enough,\u201d Averbook concluded. \u201cA digital strategy\nwith a technology plan embedded into it and which _also_ addresses mindset,\npeople and process will be 10 to 15 times more successful than a technology\nplan alone.\u201d\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Dissecting+the+employer+disconnect+in+HR+technology&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2Fdissecting-\nthe-employer-disconnect-in-hr-tech%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

However, once measured, how \u200b _exactly\u200b_ can\nleaders or managers use that data to create and nurture highly achieving\nteams?\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834cadce393.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nWhile most companies have mastered the art of \u200b _collecting \u200b_ feedback, few\nknow how to properly \u200b _action_ that feedback to make the right changes within\norganizations. Executives and HR professionals are often sitting on a goldmine\nof information that can drastically affect everything from onboarding to\nrecruiting to performance reviews. That is, of course, if they know how to\nmine for the gold, and then know exactly what to do with it once it\u2019s found.\n\nCollecting feedback is only the first step on the road to building and scaling\na \u2018culture first\u2019 company. Taking action on this feedback is actually the\ncritical step toward building a stronger company culture. Culture Amp has a\nrich trove of employee data, and after surveying nearly 2 million employees,\nthe company found that people (and some of the best employees, at that) leave\nwhen organizations have critical feedback data points to act on, but do not.\nThe data also found that employees leave companies if areas of importance to\nthem are not improved, such as a sense of belonging at the company or having\nconfidence in their leadership. But there\u2019s hope \u2013 when focused action is\ntaken and managers are included in the process, our data shows us there is a\nsignificant lift [\u21918%] to employee engagement scores in these respective focus\nareas.\n\nLongstanding internal changes, including changes made to company culture, need\nto be enacted through a\n\ncyclical process that includes collecting feedback, but more importantly,\nunderstanding the insights and lessons extracted from that feedback. The best\nstrategies to enact change start with mastering the employee feedback loop\nthat ends with taking action \u2013 all the while paying close attention to the\nhuman element behind it all.\n\n**Learn More:[Top 10 Employee Awards to Improve Engagement the\nMost](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/top-10-employee-awards-to-improve-engagement-the-most/)**\n\n# **Breaking down the feedback loop**\n\nWhen organizations believe that \u200b _collecting_ feedback is merely enough, it\nkills their chances of making impactful internal, cultural change. In a recent\nstudy, Culture Amp found that only half of the organizations actively\ncollecting feedback take steps to enact real changes. More companies can\nsucceed by mastering three steps:\n\n  1. **Collect \u200b** \\- Collect baseline information about a challenge or what your employees are actually experiencing. This could be anything from improving Diversity & Inclusion efforts, fixing the onboarding process, or putting more emphasis on work-life balance.  \n\n  2. **Understand \u200b** \\- Analyze the data, nail down insights, and choose where to focus your efforts. Get buy-in from managers and leaders across the organization on the need to change (or act).  \n\n  3. **Act** - **\u200b** Develop an incremental step-by-step plan or series of experiments. Take action as soon as you have a starting point to experiment with, even if you are not 100% certain it\u2019ll be a success.   \n\nAs highlighted in \u200b[Culture Amp\u2019s 2019 benchmark\ndata](https://academy.cultureamp.com/hc/en-\nus/articles/360003235499-2019-United-States-Benchmark)\n_\u200b_[,](https://academy.cultureamp.com/hc/en-\nus/articles/360003235499-2019-United-States-Benchmark) the top drivers of\nemployee engagement include:\n\n  * A strong focus on career development\n  * Confidence in company executives \n  * Confidence that executives believe in the importance of people \n  * Seeing that daily decision demonstrate that quality and improvement are top priorities \n\n##  \n**Taking action**\n\nThis is the most difficult step in the employee feedback loop, but the\ninvestment is worth the effort. Often organizations find themselves surveying\nemployees too frequently and not creating enough space to take action on the\nresults. This can quickly create survey fatigue and skepticism of the survey\nprocess amongst employees. Participation and motivation to engage with the\nsurvey process start to drop, and willingness to provide feedback starts to\ndrop, as well, across an entire organization.\n\nTaking action can be a scary endeavor \u2013 it can be time-consuming, and\nexpensive - but it\u2019s critical for creating cultural change. Here\u2019s a four-step\nprocess to simplify the process:\n\n  1. **Find focus** \u2013 Survey data can at times be \u200b _overwhelming \u2013 \u200b_ often companies are left with thousands of data points to sift through, hundreds of good ideas to consider, and in the end, make zero changes based on what they collected. It\u2019s pivotal to focus by identifying one or two critical areas for action. Most companies find that deciding upon one core focus area is plenty to keep them busy for at least a couple of quarters.   \n\n  2. **Hone in on the problem \u200b** \u2013 Organizations must take a step back and carefully consider the root of the problem and potential solutions. Be realistic about the resources you have and your company\u2018s leadership bandwidth to see each solution through.   \n\n  3. **Learn from positive deviance** \u2013 Look for groups within your organization that are already exemplifying behaviors that you wish to implement on a wider scale. Learn how they\u2019ve achieved this, observe how they do it, and bring in other divisions of the company to learn from their success. Culture Amp provides a great collection of ideas to action from our customers and community. We are consistently learning what ideas are hitting the mark.   \n\n  4. **Encourage change, but don\u2019t mandate it \u2013 \u200b** It\u2019s important to show, not tell. A workforce needs to buy into the proposed change for it to have an impact, and mandating standard practices may be met with hesitation and reluctance. Sharing what\u2019s working in each department or group with encouragement is a much more effective route. \n\n  \n**Learn More:[Why Your HR Team Needs Employee Journey\nMapping](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/why-your-\nhr-team-needs-employee-journey-mapping/)**\n\n# **What data can tell us when managers take action**\n\nAs more companies complete the employee feedback loop, we learn more about\nwhat effective action-taking looks like. We know that managers play a key role\nin the auction process and that there\u2019s a higher chance for improvement when\nmanagers are able to customize an action for their team. Certain industries\nare leading the way when it comes to taking impactful action, with\nHospitality, Finance and New Tech at the top of the list. We also know what\nareas are proving to be much easier or more difficult to improve on.\n\nQuick and significant improvements can be made when the focus is on managers\ngiving performance feedback (14% improvement), directing daily decisions\ntowards quality and improvement (13%), and aligning role expectations (10%).\nLooking at more challenging areas, we see that driving open and honest\ncommunication (5%), providing career opportunities (4%) and leaders\ncommunicating a vision that is motivating (5%) are tougher areas to improve.\n\nWe also can look at the data through the lens of company size. Our data tells\nus that smaller companies have better success in improving how leaders keep\npeople informed (18%) and managers staying on top of their employees\u2019 career\naspirations (17%). Whereas, larger companies (>10,000) see better improvement\nwhen they address learning and development provisions (14%) and improving\ntheir physical workspace (17%).\n\nThese figures should not steer you away from choosing the more challenging\nareas (or letting your size dictate what you take on), as these areas are also\nthe most impactful in terms of employee engagement. Effective leaders commit\nto improving them, knowing that more experimentation and investment may be\nneeded, and understand that the alternative - to not take action - is\nunacceptable. Although change doesn\u2019t happen overnight, a focus on mastering\nthe employee feedback loop is a critical step toward creating better\nworkplaces, and for building successful companies.\n\n**![Didier](/images/ajax-loader.png)Co-Author:**  \n **[Didier Elzinga](https://www.linkedin.com/in/didierelzinga/)**  \n **CEO, CultureAmp**  \nDidier Elzinga is the CEO and co-founder of Culture Amp - the Culture First\nemployee feedback company.

This outside\nthe box experience rewards employees for their hard work with a relaxing but\n[productive](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/how-to-\nfight-the-productivity-epidemic/) retreat. Getting out of the office as a team\ncan inspire creativity, build stronger bonds, and provide direction for the\nremainder of the quarter.\n\n[Planning a successful retreat](https://www.fundera.com/blog/how-to-plan-a-\ncompany-retreat) isn\u2019t rocket science, but it does take some critical thinking\nand pre-booking to get the most out of the event. Follow the seven steps below\nfor an essential roadmap to planning the best retreat for your company.\n\n## **1\\. Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**\n\nIt will be challenging to get buy-in from upper management without defining\nwhat constitutes a successful retreat. Bonus points if you can tie the results\ndirectly to revenue.\n\n  * **Morale Boost:** measure the turnover rate before and after the event, or even employee satisfaction with an anonymous survey.\n  * **Team Building:** breakdown barriers between departments, and have each explain their job in their own words to create inter-department bonds.\n  * **Marketing Materials:** take professional photos throughout the event to host on your social media pages or website for prospective employees to understand the [company culture.](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/how-to-create-a-culture-of-growth-career-development-within-your-firm/)\n\n##  \n**2\\. Schedule the Event**\n\nConsider employee schedules. If your company is an accounting firm, April and\nmonths leading up to it would be a detrimental time to schedule the retreat.\nUse the event as an annual celebration to complement the employee work ethic\nafter the conclusion of a significant busy season.\n\n**Learn More:[4 Ways Employee Engagement Can Solve Productivity\nProblem](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/4-ways-\nemployee-engagement-can-solve-productivity-problem/)**\n\n## **3\\. Confirm Attendance**\n\nThe most successful retreats are the ones where there\u2019s buy-in from\nleadership. Confirm C-level executives will be in attendance to eliminate\nhierarchy during the event. Go one step further and have leaders come up with\nice breaker exercises or themed days throughout the retreat.\n\n## **4\\. Book the Location & Transportation**\n\nLocation, location, location. Think about the proximity of the office to the\nlocation of the event. If there will be any alcohol served, make sure\ntransportation is booked to and from the event. Some modes of transportation\nto consider include:\n\n  * **Taxis**\n  * **Busses**\n  * **Limos**\n  * **Airplanes**\n\n##  \n**5\\. Negotiate Pricing**\n\nBecause you\u2019re looking for such a large group, confirm any group discounts\nbefore charging the [company card](https://www.fundera.com/business-credit-\ncards/paypal-business-credit-card). Frequently, because you\u2019re bringing the\ntransportation company and the event space so much business, there are\ndiscounts to be had.\n\n**Learn More:[How to Increase Employee Engagement through Modern\nITSM](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-to-\nincrease-employee-engagement-through-modern-itsm/)**\n\n## **6\\. Plan Events**\n\nDon\u2019t forget to plan the actual events during the retreat! These can be simple\nicebreakers or formal networking events. Think about your KPIs during this\nstage, as different activities will have more effects on the overall goal than\nothers.\n\n## **7\\. Revisit the Original KPIs**\n\nAfter the retreat is over and done with, revisit the goals set before going on\nthe resort. This is an excellent chance to elicit feedback. Understanding what\nwent well and didn\u2019t will be crucial to planning better and better retreats\nwith each passing year.\n\nWhen pitching this event to upper management, focus on the KPIs, especially\nanything that will affect the bottom line. Be an advocate for the employees\nwhile explaining the value that an event like this can have on overall morale.\n\n[![How to Plan a Company Retreat Without Losing Your Sanity](/images/ajax-\nloader.png)](https://www.fundera.com/blog/how-to-plan-a-company-retreat)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=7+Ways+to+Create+a+Company+Retreat+with+Value\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=7+Ways+to+Create+a+Company+Retreat+with+Value&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=7 Ways to Create a Company Retreat with\nValue&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2Fways-to-create-a-company-retreat-with-\nvalue%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Employee Engagement ](/category/employee-engagement/\n\"Employee Engagement\")\n\n  * [ ![20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/cover20freshemployeeengagementideasfor2020_5dd4e96253adc.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-engagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-\nengagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nAre your employees tired of the same old employee engagement activities?

Works](/user/fastco-works)\n\nJack Altman, CEO and co-founder of people management platform\n[Lattice](https://lattice.com/), believes companies need to spend as much time\nand effort on their people strategy as they do on their sales, marketing, and\nproduct strategies. Every initiative starts and ends with people, so investing\nin employees isn't just a nice thing to do; it leads to better business\noutcomes.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLattice enables HR teams to make people strategy central to their business\nstrategy. The platform includes performance management tools to improve\nemployee effectiveness as well as engagement tools for measuring feedback.\nThis performance and engagement combination helps HR teams--including\nLattice's-build strong cultures and drive business results. Altman says using\nplatform features, including Praise, a tool that allows them to share positive\nfeedback publicly, over a company-wide Slack channel, has been instrumental in\nbuilding a culture of feedback.\n\n##  **Linking performance and culture**\n\nWith continuous, customer-centric product development, and by investing in its\nown culture, Lattice joins the ranks of _Fast Company_ Most Innovative\nCompanies. Its wide range of 1,700+ customers have one thing in common _--_\nthey are willing, like Lattice, to invest in their people.\n\nAltman and co-founder Eric Koslow created Lattice in 2015 to better enable HR\nteams to make smart people decisions. They were inspired by their experience\nat Teespring, a successful Silicon Valley startup that was struggling to\nmaintain a high-performing culture as headcount increased. They recognized\nthis was a common problem and sought to build a solution, starting with a tool\nfor corporate goal setting.\n\nLattice earned the standing of #9 in the Workplace category on our 2020 Most\nInnovative Companies List.\n\nThe founders also realized the performance review was having an identity\ncrisis. Companies were moving away from hierarchical annual reviews that\nfocused on compensation. But they weren't sure how to replace them. Without\nstructured feedback mechanisms, employees felt overlooked, and companies\nmissed out on valuable insights. In 2016, Lattice became one of the first\nsoftware solutions for continuous performance review. The platform enables\nstructured one-on-one exchanges, as well as ongoing feedback, focused on\nimproving culture and cultivating great performance.\n\n![](https://assets.fastcompany.com/image/upload/h_200,w_300/v1583940277/inline-\nEric-and-Jack-resized.jpg)Co-founders Eric Koslow and Jack Altman\n\nSince then, the Lattice team has introduced a new product every six to 12\nmonths, drawing on customer feedback and empowering customer-facing teams to\ninfluence product development. In 2018, they rolled out one of the first\nengagement survey tools, and linked engagement data to performance. Now, they\nare beta-testing a career growth product that helps employees plot their\ncareer trajectories.\n\n##  **Walking their talk**\n\nLattice's leadership prioritizes its employees' personal and professional\ndevelopment, which makes work more meaningful to team members. In February\n2020, they launched the Invest in Your People Fund. The fund will be used to\ninvest $100,000 in employees who leave Lattice, after at least a three-year\ntenure, to start their own businesses.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Lattice talks about how we want employees to find the job that brings them\nsatisfaction, growth and joy, and we work really hard to help them do that\nhere. But we acknowledge the right growth path isn't always available, and, at\na certain point, you are holding employees back.

It was day four of stay-at-home orders from the\nCanadian government, in their response to the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe crisis unleashed by the novel coronavirus has been unprecedented. As\nbusinesses were ordered to shutdown indefinitely, HR folks' crisis-control\nmode switched to autopilot. The responsibility of keeping businesses open by\nimplementing sustainable work-from-home strategies fell squarely upon HR's\nshoulders. They had to create safe working practices for everyone across the\norganizational spectrum - from the most senior to frontline workers who\nweren't in a position to work from home. The playing field had suddenly been\nlevelled.\n\nUnder the crisis, HR had to get creative in assigning and redeploying talent\nto the most important teams. Inevitably, many HR leaders had to navigate\nsignificant employee layoffs.\n\nFortunately, social and physical distancing have become buzzwords in an era\nwhen technology has armed us with the tools needed to stay socially connected\nbut from a distance.\n\nCompassion was the call of the day. I have seen many of my colleagues and\nclients selflessly rising to the greater need with integrity. They have been\nquick, creative, resourceful and agile in their planning and execution. If one\ncompany had to downsize, they were proactively collaborating with\norganizations that needed more people. They were also supporting each other\nthrough virtual happy hours to connect, let off steam, and check on each\nother's wellbeing.\n\nWe have all done many desktop business continuity exercises, but this is real\nlife and beyond anyone's imagination. This situation has stretched all our\ncapabilities and resilience. Through these times, character will be developed\nand revealed.\n\n**Empathy required**  \nThe first call of duty was for all leaders to become CEOs - chief empathy\nofficers. The Centre for Creative Leadership defines empathy as \"the ability\nto experience and relate to the thoughts, emotions or experience of others.\nEmpathy is more than simple sympathy, which is being able to understand and\nsupport others with compassion or sensitivity.\" It's important not to assume\nwe understand what is going on with other people and remember that this crisis\nwill affect everyone differently.\n\nSome people will be concerned about being productive while working at home and\nkeeping their children entertained and educated. Others will be concerned\nabout vulnerable relatives who they may not be able to see because of\nquarantine restrictions. With the volume of layoffs, many will be concerned\nabout their financial position and future livelihood. Gig workers will be\nconcerned about their next project.\n\nThe heroes on the front line of retail and the health sector are in vulnerable\npositions. People are anxious about the news and troubled by self-isolation\nand loneliness. The leaders I coach have had to adapt how they lead in adverse\nand ambiguous times. They need to find moments to build awareness and connect\nwith people daily. As chief empathy officers, we will listen. We will be open.\nWe will connect. We will relate. We will help. We will get through this\ntogether.\n\n**Decluttering HR**  \nAs day-10 of COVID-19's self-isolation rolled around, I was reminded of a Josh\nBersin article and the need to reset HR. I'd set myself some ambitious (and\nsomewhat unrealistic) goals to declutter my life and that got me thinking: Is\nit time to \"Kondo\" HR?\n\nThrough a period of sustained economic growth, as businesses and as HR, we\nhave become hoarders. Driven by the demand to personalize HR and the employee\nexperience, we want our organizations to have the best of everything and we\nwant to please everyone. As a result, we have layered more and more complexity\non to processes and people that were already creaking at the seams. In a bid\nto be everything to everyone, HR has suffered an identity crisis in trying to\nfind new things that work.\n\nI have found myself balancing the demands of senior leaders and the\nconflicting needs of employees. There was never a shortage of good ideas - but\nthey would not always have the buy-in to make them sustainable, so we'd\nquickly move on to the next.\n\nCOVID-19 is forcing all of us pare down our lives and, in many ways, we are\ndiscovering pleasure in the simple things that we'd taken for granted. As a\nhabitual coffee-drinker, I have now developed more of an affinity for hot\nwater! Similarly, from a job perspective, this is HR's time to discard the\nfluffy nice-to-haves and rediscover the essentials of the employee experience.\n\nWhile hoarding's nemesis, Marie Kondo, is busy decluttering her own life, HR\nhas its moment to Kondo HR. Follow the same steps. Review every process, tool,\nintervention and policy and ask your people - does it bring you joy?\n\nWork is moving online, but the HR processes need to be revisited. Back in\nearly 2019, A relatively small [survey](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-\nworkplace/digital-employee-experience-still-not-viewed-as-business-critical/)\nshowed that only 20 per cent of companies could define what they meant by\n\"digital employee experience,\" suggesting even fewer of them actually had one.\nI don't imagine things have changed much in the intervening period.\nConsequently, many companies will be seeing cracks in their digital\nenvironments, post-COVID-19.\n\nI have three simple suggestions for HR leaders to create a digital employee\nexperience to ensure they keep their people engaged and productive while\nworking remotely.\n\n  * Step back and using real insights to review your employee experience through a digital lens. Identify where you have gaps and prioritise accordingly. It will be important to focus on the items that will have the biggest impact. Onboarding people virtually will be tricky, for example, but if you don't plan to do any significant hiring, why worry now?\n  * Leverage the digital solutions that you have already, before investing in any new toys. If you have an LMS, get it out to people. Create a competition around it to generate more users and more value. Everyone is jumping on Zoom (even uninvited people apparently!) but what other platforms do you have to keep your people engaged?\n  * Monitor the sentiment of your people regularly through check-ins and leader feedback. If you continue to identify issues, I suspect most of them can be fixed by leaders taking even more time to connect with their people. If (and only if!) it still isn't working, then a very specific technology solution might be required - and there are a lot of great ones out there.\n\nIn businesses, this is the time for us to hold the magnifying glass to\npractices that no longer work and replace them with simpler, more meaningful\nones.

Particularly in challenging times, leading employers are\nfocusing on their workforce, specifically fostering healthy lifestyles,\nsupporting financial wellness, and providing skills and training as careers\nchange due to AI and technology developments. The reasoning is clear:\nAccording to [Mercer](https://www.mercer.com/)\u2019s _2020 Global Talent Trends_\nstudy, 34% of employees expect their jobs to be replaced in three years, 61%\nof employees believe their employers are preparing them for the future of work\nand 55% trust their organization to reskill them if their job changes as a\nresult of automation. As employers transform to tackle these matters, they\nshould reconsider their company\u2019s purpose and their responsibilities to\nemployees and employees\u2019 future earnings, since 63% of HR leaders predict\nstagnant wage growth. And, they need to do so while facing unforeseen\nchallenges like COVID-19 and a likely economic softening that could impact the\nadoption of new workforce strategies.\n\n**HR News:**[Espressive Raises $30 Million Series B to Gain AI-Leadership in\nEnterprise Service Management](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/ai-in-\nhr/espressive-raises-30-million-series-b-to-gain-aileadership-in-enterprise-\nservice-management/)\n\n\u201cBalancing economics and empathy in all people's decisions is important, even\nmore so now as we face questions, concerns and the uncertainty of a global\npandemic. Organizations need to have a financial model and cultural mindset\nthat enables them to prepare for and invest in the future,\u201d said Ilya Bonic,\nPresident, Career, and Head of Strategy at\n[Mercer](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/digital-transformation/mercer-\nintroduces-mercer-digital/). \u201cThis rethinking of purpose and priorities is\nvital across the organization, but especially for HR. The findings from this\nyear\u2019s study make it clear that the transformation of the HR function is a key\ncomponent to creating a sustainable organization.\u201d\n\n### **Mercer\u2019s study identifies four trends for 2020:**\n\n  \n**Focus on Futures:** Work together to ensure people thrive now and in the\nfuture. With a new mandate for business, 85% of executives agree that the\norganization\u2019s purpose should extend beyond shareholder primacy, yet only 35%\nof companies deliver on this today. Meanwhile, one in three employees says\nthey would prefer to work for an employer that shows responsibility towards\nall stakeholders, beyond just shareholders and investors. Furthermore, much of\nan organization\u2019s success depends on whether it can support its talent to grow\nand shape a sustainable business. This is on the executive agenda \u2013 with 68%\nwanting to focus more on environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals.\nWhile 61% of employees trust their employer to prepare them for the future of\nwork, 63% feel at risk of burnout. Career pipelines have tightened as 72% of\nexperienced workers say they plan to work past retirement age, and 55% of Gen\nXers say opportunities to advance are limited because of longevity in the\nworkplace. Better management of older workers is part of creating shared\nvalue. More than three-quarters (78%) of employees want long-term financial\nplanning, yet just 23% of companies say they provide financial education for\nemployees today. \u201cEach organizational stakeholder has a crutch. For HR it\u2019s\ntechnology, for employees it\u2019s trust, and for the C-Suite it\u2019s HR. When those\ncrutches are strong it\u2019s amplifying; when they\u2019re weak it jeopardizes the\nability of all stakeholders to create sustainable futures,\u201d said Kate Bravery,\nPartner and Advisory Solutions & Insight Leader at Mercer.\n\nIn most regions, employees\u2019 most valued career support is personal and\nprofessional growth opportunities (73%). This is the same for the US (78%),\nfollowed by the company has a good sense of employees\u2019 current skills,\ninterests and skill gaps (73%). \u201cTo attract and retain talent, companies need\nto offer and deliver futures with ample and equitable opportunities to grow\nand develop, health and retirement savings strategies that make a difference\nin their physical and financial wellness, and a climate of trust born out of\ncollective responsibility for shared futures,\u201d said Ms. Bravery.\n\n**Race to Reskill:** Transform the workforce by reskilling for a new world\neconomy. Reskilling is the talent investment most capable of driving business\nsuccess, and 99% of all organizations are embarking on transformation and\nreport significant skill gaps. Workforce capability and lack of future skills\nwere the top reason transformations failed. Although 78% of employees say they\nare ready to learn new skills, 38% claim they do not have enough time for\ntraining. Moreover, just 34% of HR leaders are investing in workforce learning\nand reskilling as part of their strategy to prepare for the future of work and\n40% do not know what skills their workforce has today. \u201cTransformation is not\na question of whether to adopt, but about how best to adapt. To stay ahead,\norganizations need to reskill at scale, with speed, and across all generations\nin their workforce,\u201d said Ms. Bravery.\n\nAcross regions, employees say innovation will be the top in-demand skill in\nthe next 12 months. HR leaders in the US agree with their employees. Moreover,\nin the US, this in-demand skill is followed by digital marketing and customer\nexperience for HR leaders and complex problem solving and advanced\ninterpersonal/relationship skills for employees.\n\n**Sense with Science:** See ahead by augmenting AI with human intuition.\nAdvances in machine learning continue to permeate across industries and ways\nof life: Use of predictive analytics has nearly quadrupled in five years (from\n10% in 2016 to 39% today). Yet, only 43% of organizations use metrics to\nidentify employees likely to leave, 41% know when critical talent is likely to\nretire, 18% know the impact of pay strategies on performance, 15% can\ndetermine if it is better to buy/build/borrow employees and 12% are using\nanalytics to correct inequities and prevent them recurring. Other forms of\nemployee engagement data gathering are on the rise too; 62% of companies are\nusing pulse surveys today, and 33% plan to invest in this in 2020. While\nmachines outperform humans at tasks related to scale and speed, humans outpace\nmachines at sense-checking and judgment, which are critical elements of\nethical decision-making. Yet while 67% of HR leaders are confident they can\nensure AI is not institutionalizing bias, ethics codes about the collection,\napplication, and implications of people analytics are still in their infancy.\nTalent assessment is equally an area in which human intuition is needed along\nwith the digital assessments \u2013 today only one in two employees (52%) had a\npositive assessment experience and found it useful. \u201cCompanies know more today\nabout human behavior and cognition than ever before. How they gather and act\non this information demands a greater focus on moral and equitable ethics,\u201d\nsaid Ms. Bravery.\n\nAcross regions, disconnects exist between the analytics the C-suite\nprioritizes and those HR leaders provide. In the US, 62% of HR leaders provide\nanalytics on the C-suite\u2019s top priority as to what are key drivers of\nengagement in the organization. Yet, only 40% are providing analytics for how\ndifferent retirement options impact older workers' behavior, which is also a\ntop priority of the C-suite.\n\n**Energize the Experience:** Inspire and invigorate people by redesigning\ntheir work experience. Delivering on the employee experience is HR\u2019s top\npriority, and 58% of organizations are redesigning to become more people-\ncentric. Yet, only 27% of executives believe employee experience will yield a\nbusiness return. And, even though 61% of employees trust their employer to\nlook after their well-being and 48% of executives rank it as a top workforce\nconcern, only 29% of HR leaders have a health and well-being strategy. This is\nnot an area to be missed as employees whose company is focused on employee\nhealth and well-being are four times more likely to be energized. Energized\nemployees are essential to realizing organizations\u2019 transformation agenda:\nthey are more likely to stay, more resilient, and more ready to reskill. HR\ntransformation is high on organizations\u2019 agenda and delivering on the employee\nexperience requires HR to step out of its functional silos, yet only 40% of HR\nleaders say they have an integrated people strategy. \u201cInteractions with\nemployees matter and all interactions from progressive care practices to fair\npay to flexible working make up the employee experience,\u201d said Ms. Bravery.\n_\u201c_ More than twenty years of transforming HR have yielded moderate success.\nCompanies need to upgrade their thinking about what drives people and\nperformance and step away from typical HR models.\u201d\n\nImproving the employee experience tops HR\u2019s future of work priorities in\nEurope, North America, and the Middle East, while Asia and Pacific put\ntransforming talent practices (recruitment, performance management, and\nsuccession) in the top spot. Other priorities for HR in the US include\nmeasuring skills gaps against business objectives, implementing a compelling\ntalent value proposition and developing an integrated people strategy.\n\n**HR News:**[GigSmart's Partners With Stride to Provide Extended Benefits to\nWorkers](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/news/compensation-benefits/gigsmarts-\npartners-with-stride-to-provide-extended-benefits-to-workers-3/)\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Femployers-focus-on-health-financial-wellbeing-and-careers-of-the-\nemployees-surveys-\nmercer%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=Employers+Focus+on+Health%2C+Financial+Wellbeing+and+Careers+of+the+Employees%2C+Surveys+Mercer\n\"Share this News on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Employers+Focus+on+Health%2C+Financial+Wellbeing+and+Careers+of+the+Employees%2C+Surveys+Mercer&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Femployers-focus-on-health-financial-wellbeing-and-careers-of-the-\nemployees-surveys-\nmercer%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this News on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Femployers-focus-on-health-financial-wellbeing-and-careers-of-the-\nemployees-surveys-\nmercer%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this News on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Femployers-focus-on-health-financial-wellbeing-and-careers-of-the-\nemployees-surveys-\nmercer%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this News on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-email-\nicon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=Employers Focus on Health, Financial Wellbeing and\nCareers of the Employees, Surveys\nMercer&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Fnews%2Fworkplace-\nwellness%2Femployers-focus-on-health-financial-wellbeing-and-careers-of-the-\nemployees-surveys-\nmercer%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this News via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Workplace Wellness ](/category/workplace-wellness/\n\"Workplace Wellness\")\n\n  * [ ![Open Enrollment for Benefits: 5 Important Questions to Ask Your Employees](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/how_to_offer_effective_open_enrollment_benefits_5db1af6eea03b.jpg) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/open-enrollment-benefits-important-questions-to-ask/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ Open Enrollment for Benefits: 5 Important Questions to Ask Your\nEmployees ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/workplace-wellness/open-\nenrollment-benefits-important-questions-to-ask/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nOpen enrollment season is around the corner.

But the toughest challenge,\nregardless of where your workforce works from, is to keep your employees\nengaged, motivated and happy.\n\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)![](https://indicanews.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Madhukar-scaled.jpg)Madhukar Govindaraju\n\nMadhukar Govindaraju, Founder and CEO of\n[Numly](https://www.numly.io/)[TM](https://www.numly.io/), says that the team\nat Numly\u2122 has successfully developed a game-changing innovation, by applying\nAdvanced Data Science and AI to drive employee engagement in medium and large\nenterprises, and to accelerate professional and business growth through the\ncultivation of soft skills.\n\nGovindaraju believes that knowledge sharing has to be the underpinning of any\nemployee engagement process. With Numly\u2122, the company is leading with people\nnetworking, skills coaching and advanced data science to usher in the future\nof remote work.\n\nMost recently in 2018, Govindaraju embarked on a journey, yet again in his\ncareer, from an experienced executive in the software industry to a serial\nentrepreneur. With more than two decades of experience in the software\nindustry as a GM/Product Executive, CTO, SVP Engineering, and business leader,\nat some of the world\u2019s leading software companies, such as VMware, Microsoft,\nTriNet HR Group, Saba Software, SAP / Business Objects, Hyperion Solutions,\nHP, IBM, and several successful startups, Govindaraju has seen it all when it\ncomes to initiatives on employee engagement, employee performance management,\nequity, diversity, inclusivity and leadership development programs at global\nworkplaces.\n\nBut in reality, Govindaraju believes that these programs often get drowned by\nage-old HR customs and rigid adherence to red-tape like rules, something that\ncompanies are still struggling with.\n\nSharing about his own experiences, in a global software behemoth, wherein he\nhad to deal with rejection and stonewalling from his HR Business Partners when\nhe tried to push for deserving and talented candidates for promotions and\ngrowth opportunities, only due to antiquated HR policies relating to\npromotions based on seniority, \u201cpromotion velocity coefficients\u201d and \u201clength-\nin-level\u201d metrics, under the umbrella of \u201ctop talent\u201d and \u201chigh-potential\u201d\ntalent management.\n\nGovindaraju says, he has personally seen brilliant and smart employees leave\norganizations they liked to work for, because the companies (and their HR\nteams that manage workplace culture) were riddled with ineffective employee\ndevelopment initiatives that emphasized maintaining hierarchical power growth\nrather than engagement and growth of future leaders. Women and millennials are\nthe most affected by this apathy that is often seen in big or large\norganizations. It has been the driving factor in my quest to find a solution\nthat can help companies improve employee engagement, performance, and\nproductivity; identify, attract, and retain top talent as well as grow the\nnext generation of business leaders.\n\nIt is hardly surprising that with remote working growing at such a phenomenal\npace, personalized employee development has become even more difficult than\nbefore. It has become imperative for organizations to invest in solutions that\nwill help them coach, train and develop a skilled workforce, irrespective of\ntheir location.\n\n\n\n ** _But what does it mean to engage teams working remotely? Can Advanced Data\nScience and AI be applied to this problem?_**\n\n ****\n\n**Identify high-potential remote employees**\n\nWith companies facing acute shortage of hireable skilled employees, they are\nnow looking internally within their workforce to identify and nurture high-\npotential employees who can fuel their leadership pipeline. But lack of\ncommunication between employees or departments working in silos owing to\nphysical distance can lead to discontent, lowered motivation levels, and low\nproductivity.\n\nSimilar to any in-house workforce, companies have to find a way to give equal\nopportunities to their remote workforce to develop and grow in their careers.\nEnsuring clear, open, and transparent communication along with a secure way to\ngive proactive feedback is necessary to enable employees at work. Absence of\nface-to-face interactions should not be a roadblock to identify hard-working\nemployees and help them navigate in their career graph.\n\n **Provide opportunities for soft skills development**\n\nRemote workers, in general, get the short end of the stick when it comes to\nskill development focus by organizations, compared to their other\ncounterparts.\n\nWhile it is easier to identify technical skill, development needs of the\nworkforce, power skills such as problem-solving, communication, decision\nmaking, and collaboration, that help employees navigate challenges at their\nworkplace can be difficult to train. The result will be the creation of a more\nmature and well-rounded [leadership](https://numly.io/the-leaders-role-in-\nemployee-engagement/) pipeline, with polished power skills that complement\ntechnical skills.\n\n **Drive self-development**\n\nTo engage teams located remotely, self-development can be an enticing factor\npromoted to employees. But it can be a tricky art to master, in the absence of\ndirection, especially when it comes to an individual\u2019s career path.\n\nRemote workers can find it hard to know which skills to improve and focus on,\nespecially in the absence of everyday interactions, leading to dejection and\nflagging engagement. Organizations have to put in the effort to keep their\nemployees self-motivated and pushing for self-development. Leveraging tests\nlike 16 Personality Factor (16PF) Assessments can help organizations identify\ntheir skill gap, and development needs of their workforce quantitatively.\n\nOrganizations can then leverage this information to coach their remote\nworkforce to navigate their soft & power skills chasm and drive business\ngrowth.\n\n **Say goodbye to generic engagement programs**\n\nOrganizations all over the world use archaic, one-size-fits-all [engagement\nprograms](https://numly.io/lets-talk-about-the-building-blocks-of-great-\nemployee-experience/), that are mostly Survey-tool based. For example: Annual\nEngagement Surveys, Performance Feedback Surveys, etc. These programs don\u2019t\nreally deliver measurable results and they definitely do not help in engaging\na remote workforce. Today\u2019s workforce, including the Millennials, are quite\nvocal about their demands for personalized engagement programs, such as\ninnovation engineering, new hire skill development, inside sales coaching,\ncustomer success team skills coaching, sales management coaching, and many\nmore. By taking a tailored approach towards the skills development needs of\nyour remote workforce, organizations can achieve phenomenal improvements in\nengagement levels, even in remote teams.\n\nOrganizations should also foster shared values, ensure that employees,\nirrespective of where they are located, are bound by common work principles\nand attitudes. These values have to be communicated clearly, and repeatedly to\nyour remote workforce in order to boost engagement with remote teams.\n\nGovindaraju believes that Numly\u2019s AI-enhanced, people networking and coaching\nplatform - [NumlyEngage](https://www.numly.io/)[TM](https://www.numly.io/) is\nthe need of the hour for companies as they scramble to find a way to connect\nand engage with their work-from-home employees.\n\nAccording to a 2019 Workday-Bloomberg survey, companies are 42 percent more\nconcerned about soft skills than they\u2019re about hard skills. Soft skills have\nbecome increasingly important in the age of robotic process automation, as\ncompanies need them to build bench strength, grow the next generation of\nleaders, and effectively compete in the Future of Work.\n[NumlyEngage\u2122](https://www.numly.io/) addresses these needs directly. It\u2019s an\ninnovative platform that enables the development of soft skills through\npersonalized coaching, in a structured and consistent manner, enhanced by\nMachine Learning and AI.\n\n\n\n###

a message every HR professional needs to hear\nas the transformation of work continues.  As a strategy, employee engagement\nhas always been a chief concern for human resources and leaders within any\ngiven company, but no one could have predicted when the concept was first\nintroduced nearly 30 years ago, that it would have the impact on the business'\nstrategy that it does now.\n\nHaving said that, engagement isn't just about getting better results for the\nbusiness, it's about ensuring the company's longevity.  And given recent\nstatistical data, it's become a financial imperative.\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/ee_stat_1.png)\n\nThat's an astonishing number, one that should spur every HR professional to\nplace more focus on their organization's engagement strategy.  Low engagement\nfrom employees can and will have a negative impact every part of the business\nfrom recruitment to retention.\n\nIn the guide below, the HR Exchange Network explores the topic of engagement\nin more detail.  It takes a look an in depth look at what engagement is, the\ncurrent state of affairs, effective strategies and a prediction of what is to\ncome.\n\n# **What is Employee Engagement?**\n\nIf one were to ask HR professionals from different companies to define\nengagement, there is a high likelihood different responses would be received.\nSome might take a numbers approach while others would take [a psychological\napproach](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/articles/the-\nimportance-of-the-psychological-contract) or a different approach altogether.\nAs is often the case with other HR concepts, the definition really lies in the\n\"eyes of the beholder.\"\n\nThe term was first coined by psychologist William Kahn in a 1990 study titled\n[_Psychological Conditions of Personal Engagement and Disengagement at\nWork_](https://www.talenteck.com/academic/Kahn-1990.pdf).  In the piece, Khan\nstudied two different workplaces:  a very structured and formal architecture\nfirm and a casual summer camp.  From his observations, he defined engagement\nas \"the harnessing of organization members' selves to their work roles; in\nengagement, people employ and express themselves physically, cognitively, and\nemotionally during role performances\".\n\nAdditionally, Kahn outlined three [psychological\nconditions](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/news/psychological-contracts-and-leadership) that allow engagement\nto exist:\n\n  1. **Meaningfulness** - Is the work meaningful enough to the employee that he/she engages with their full-self?\n  2. **Safety** - Is the work environment such that a person can bring their full-self without fear of criticism?\n  3. **Availability** - Is the employee mentally and physically able to express their full-self in the work environment?\n\nKahn further stated those individuals who are fully engaged with the\norganization will take ownership of their work and will be loyal to the\norganization.  Additionally, he says engagement isn't a constant.  Any number\nof experiences can cause engagement to change.\n\n#### HR and the Future of Work 2020\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/future_of_work_inlinead_image.png)\n\nA new era of HR dawns. Where once HR ruled with the \"one-size-fits-all\"\nmentality, younger employees are rebuking the idea. Ideas like development,\nflexible scheduling, gig markets and remote work are the building blocks of\ntheir mission. This FREE online event will help HR professionals once again\nfind their footing in these changing times while bringing together HR\nprofessionals who are successfully addressing the issues of diversity,\npersonalization, and adapting to the future of work.\n\n[Register Now](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/events-future-of-\nwork-2020/?mac=HRIQ_OnlineEvents_Inline_Ad_Listing\u00aeisterModal=true)\n\nOf course, Kahn's original definition has changed somewhat over the three\ndecades since it was first coined.  Instead of engagement being focused solely\non the person bringing their full-selves to work, it's more about the\nemployee's willingness to go \"[above and\nbeyond](https://theirf.org/research/irf-history-of-employee-engagement/1555/)\"\nto benefit the organization.\n\n## **Impacts of Engagement**\n\nWhat we've learned about engagement since its inception has colored the\napproach HR professionals and leaders have taken.  An [increase in engagement\nmarks a positive impact of the\nbusiness](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/articles/how-\nhr-is-driving-business-impact-at-buzzfeed) and a decrease marks a negative\nimpact.\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/ee_stat_2.png)\n\n    \n    \n    Source:  [Building a High Development Culture Through Your Employee Engagement Strategy](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/267512/development-culture-engagement-paper-2019.aspx) - Gallup  \n      \n      \n    \n\n## **What are HR Leaders Saying?**\n\nTo understand more about employee engagement, here are a few quotes from HR\nprofessionals on the topic and associated issues.\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/v2_debbie_fiorino_employee_engagement_quote.gif)\n\n\"High engagement through amazing culture and opportunities for your teammates\nis one of, if not the main drivers, in increasing teammate retention.\" Atrium\nHealth's SVP of Workforce Engagement Sebastien Girard said.  \"High retention\nand high engagement results creates less pressure on the organization and HR.\nIt also means higher expertise, higher tenure, accelerated growth, and\nstronger productivity.\"\n\n\"There is a direct correlation between the level of engagement an employee\ndemonstrates and the amount of discretionary effort they are offer,\" World\nTravel Holdings senior vice president of Human Resources Debbie Fiorino said.\n\"An engaged employee is one who is fully involved in, and enthusiastic about\ntheir work, and thus will act in a way that furthers their organization's\ninterests. This translates to a greater experience for our customers, which\ngenerates a loyal following. Loyal customers translate to revenue and\nprofits.\"\n\n\"I would say that engagement is harder to achieve today than it was 20 years\nago, or in the past, because we are less engaging places to work. We used to\nhave an ethos where employees would come to an organization; they would commit\nto an organization, build a career there and want to stay for life. The\ncompany would equally make a commitment that it would develop a career for\nlife,\" ICON plc executive vice president of strategic initiates Don Kraft\nsaid.  \"Companies would look out for people, protect them and invest in them.\nOver a period of time, we have invested less and signaled a reduced commitment\nto people. As a result there are many people, including a generation of young\npeople, in their 30s and under, who have watched their parents, and perhaps\nthemselves, impacted by these things. They are saying, \"I can't, and therefore\nI won't, count on my employer.\"\n\n## **Engagement Ideas**\n\nHR practioners globally are looking for the right engagement \"recipe\".  As is\noften the case, the \"recipe\" is different for every company in every industry.\nAs a result, it is often difficult for HR to know where to start.  There is\nsomething to be said for looking at other companies, especially those that are\nsimilar, for inspiration, but the best place to start is internally.  Here are\nfive different [strategies and theories as to how to increase employee\nengagement](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/infographics/employee-engagement-best-practices) across the\nworkforce.\n\n1\\. Flexibility\n\nOffering employees an opportunity to set and design their own schedule feels\ncounterintuitive at first glance.  Most HR leaders are conditioned to believe\ngiving an employee the ability to set their own work hours will cause a\ndecrease in productivity.  A fair amount of research suggests the opposite is\ntrue.  Employees given the freedom to set their own schedules are often more\nproductive and happier employees.  They are also more engaged in the\nworkplace.\n\n> RELATED:  [12 Work-Life Balance\n> Tips](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/news/12-work-\n> life-balance-tips)\n\n2\\. Required Tools\n\nWhen an employee starts working for a new company, he or she will expect to\nhave the needed tools to complete their job responsibilities effectively.  If\nthe employee has access to those items and can work as expected, employee\nengagement will flourish.  Deloitte calls this \"enabling infrastructure.\"\nWithout the necessary tools, employees will disengage.\n\n3\\. Employee Surveys\n\nEmployee feedback is important.  Even more important is the need for leaders\nto listen to the feedback and act on that information.  This isn't to say\nevery leader has to do or put into practice every employee suggestion, but\nthey do need to consider the feedback.  Additionally, the leader must be\ntransparent about the feedback and whether it will be put into action.\nAccording to an engagement report from Aon, this approach to feedback helps an\norganization quickly address problems, but more importantly it makes the\nemployee feel valued.  Thus, it increases engagement.\n\n4\\. Manager selection\n\nIt's been said before:  employees don't leave companies.  They leave bad\nmanagers.  Managers and leaders are critical to engagement success according\nto Gallup.  The right leader knows their success and the organization's\nsuccess is linked to the engagement of the employee.  Hiring the right\nexternal candidate or internal candidate for a manager role; one whom\npossesses the ability to manage people effectively can have a positive impact\non engagement rates.\n\n5\\. Training and Development Opportunities\n\nInvesting in employees' by offering training and development opportunities\nprovides the atmosphere for workers to become more engaged.  A lack of these\nopportunities typically translates to the employee not feeling valued by the\ncompany and will thus negatively impact the chance for engagement.  Employees\nwho are not invested will not support the company in any way other than making\nsure they can protect their job.  At least until they can secure other\nemployment.\n\n## **Measuring Engagement**\n\nWhen it comes to measuring engagement, there are several schools of thought on\nthe issue.  Some suggest an organic approach.  Gathering data through\nconversations such as one-on-one meetings or team meetings.  Others suggest a\nformal approach like engagement surveys that happen once or twice a year.\nThese surveys can provide a wealth of data that helps indicate what engagement\ninitiatives are working and how engaged employees actually are with the\norganization.\n\nEngagement surveys differ from other types of surveys.  According to [SHRM,\nengagement surveys measure](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-\nsamples/toolkits/pages/sustainingemployeeengagement.aspx) \"employees'\ncommitment, motivation, sense of purpose and passion for their work and the\norganization\" while other surveys, satisfaction surveys for instance, measure\nworkers' \"views, attitudes and perceptions of their organization.\"\n\nThe most important piece of measuring engagement isn't the measurement itself,\nhowever.  It's all about how the results are shared and how the findings are\nput into action.  If leaders have access to this information, share it and\nthen don't capitalize on it, they can expect engagement scores to suffer in\nthe future.\n\n## **The Future of Engagement**\n\nEngagement will continue to be a main focus moving forward.  As eluded to\nearlier, this is directly related to the fact the workforce is transforming.\nToday's newest workers and their successors care more about personal growth\nand purpose than just getting a paycheck from employers.  They want to make a\ndifference while growing and building relationships with the organization and\nco-workers.\n\nBut changes in the workforce aren't the only catalyst for the increased\nimportance of engagement.  It shares the spotlight with technology.\nTechnology has revolutionized the way people work and engage with that work\nand one another.  And technology, like engagement, is constantly in flux.\n\nAll of this points to the reality engagement continues to play, as it will in\nthe future, a large role.  Engaging these workers will be critical to future\nsuccess, not only of the organization, but so too for the employee.

Often, companies\nfind out about disengagement when it\u2019s already too late \u2013 and addressing this\ncan be expensive. This is where employee engagement surveys come in.\n\nThe format of employee engagement surveys varies from company to company, or\neven across departments. For example, a small team can choose to deploy short\npulse surveys every so often instead of detailed questionnaires that deliver\nenormous amounts of data.\n\nYou can also conduct quick internal surveys to measure the effectiveness of\nyour initiatives, using the results to improve them without sharing the data\nwith the entire workforce. External surveys, on the other hand, are meant to\nmeasure the overall levels of engagement in your organization and inform your\nemployees, keeping them up to date about engagement in the workplace.\n\n### **Engagement survey benchmarks**\n\n  \nEmployee engagement surveys can be measured against two benchmarks.\n\n**1\\. Internal survey benchmarks:** The organization sets these benchmarks for\nwhat constitutes positive engagement within the organization, and they help\ncompare the improvement in engagement from one time period to another.\n\n**2\\. External survey benchmarks:** External benchmarks help you compare your\norganization\u2019s engagement levels with the competition. External benchmarks may\nnot be a good measure of internal engagement levels, as they make comparisons\nbetween organizations that may or may not be at the same level as yours. For\ninstance, if you are a small organization with a single location, you cannot\ncompare your engagement levels with that of an organization that has locations\nall across the world, has been in the business much longer than you, and has a\ndifferent culture from your own.\n\n### **Considerations when defining an employee engagement survey**\n\n  \nRegardless of the variations mentioned above, there are a few rules of thumb\nyou can follow when defining an employee engagement survey:\n\n1\\. The 12-month (annual) survey is an industry-standard. It helps you gather\nmeaningful data from most employees, as the average employee tenure is 2+\nyears.\n\n2\\. Companies new to employee engagement surveys can start by adopting an\n18-month frequency, with detailed questionnaires. This will give you a lot of\ndata to benchmark future surveys.\n\n3\\. Shorter surveys can be shared at key moments of the employee experience\nlifecycle \u2013 for example, right after an employee joins the company or during\noffboarding.\n\n4\\. Surveys are typically anonymized to protect employee privacy. An employee\nengagement survey vendor can help you get this right.\n\n5\\. You need some level of expertise in engagement analytics to conduct these\nsurveys. Remember, it\u2019s not just about collecting data \u2013 you should be able to\nidentify patterns and correlations to arrive at actionable insights. And then\nimplement the necessary action to ensure that engagement levels improve or\nstay intact.\n\n### **Benefits of administering employee engagement surveys**\n\nIt may seem that adopting employee engagement surveys is a long-drawn and\ncomplicated process. So why is it a staple for all leading employers?\n\nAdministering an employee engagement survey offers several key benefits.\n\n**1\\. They quantify**[ **employee\nengagement**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-engagement/) **,** a phenomenon that\u2019s difficult\nto measure. As a result, they also help to preempt turnover by detecting\ninstances of low engagement for specific teams and line managers.\n\n**2\\. They are customizable and help elicit specific data.** You can customize\nthe survey according to your unique requirements. For example, if you\u2019ve\nrecently undergone an organizational change, you can survey employees to\nunderstand the impact of the change on them.\n\n**3\\. They help raise employee awareness about the organization.** This is a\nfrequently overlooked benefit of these surveys \u2013 by asking your employees to\nshare their feedback on a particular aspect of the workplace, you increase\ntheir awareness and the chance they will rethink their behavior/response.\n\nNow that you\u2019re equipped with a working definition of employee engagement\nsurveys, let\u2019s take a look at how you can get started with the employee\nengagement survey process. Could technology vendors help you automate survey\nprograms and get more accurate results? Let\u2019s find out.\n\n**Learn More:** **[How to Engage Employees in 2020: 10 Impactful\nSolutions](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-to-\nengage-employees-impactful-solutions/)**\n\n## **Breaking Down the Employee Engagement Survey Process: 5 Steps**\n\nConducting the first survey is always the hardest. Because you\u2019re just getting\nstarted with the employee engagement survey process, it can be difficult to\nset a benchmark and get buy-in from senior leaders. We recommend this five-\nstep methodology to kick off the initiative:\n\n![The process of creating and administering employee engagement\nsurveys](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. The process of creating and administering employee engagement\nsurveys**\n\n### **1\\. Identify the targeted employee group**\n\n  \nFor your first survey, identify a representative employee group, cutting\nacross multiple departments, ranks, and locations. Start from employees at the\nlowest rung to key team leaders. This group creates a baseline upon which you\ncan conduct more extensive surveys to measure how engagement has improved or\ndipped over time.\n\nFor more mature companies with multiple locations, for example, targeted\nemployee engagement surveys may work better. For instance, if there is a hint\nof disengagement at Location A, you might want to conduct department-specific\nsurveys in that location to pinpoint the cause.\n\n### **2\\. Define the objective of the survey**\n\n  \nA common mistake that companies make when conducting employee engagement\nsurveys is trying to capture data about all drivers of engagement. Remember,\nno single survey can give you the whole picture of employee engagement across\nyour entire organization.\n\nIt is better to start with a hypothesis \u2013 for example, X% of the workforce\nrisks turnover because of the Y factor (e.g., lack of remote working options).\nFormulate your survey questions to validate or negate this hypothesis.\nFollowing this best practice will ensure your employee engagement survey is\noutcome-oriented, making the next step that much easier.\n\n### **3\\. Obtain buy-in and investments for engagement survey technology**\n\n  \nIn the digital era, manual surveys don\u2019t make a lot of sense. Even if you have\nthe data analysis expertise needed, the manual approach takes a lot of effort\n\u2013 by the time the results are ready, engagement levels may have shifted, and a\nnew employee engagement survey may be required!\n\nEquipped with a clear objective for the survey, you can approach senior\nmanagement or even the C-suite to get behind your decision to invest in an\nemployee engagement survey platform. With leadership support, you can go ahead\nand choose a vendor that is aligned with your requirements.\n\n### **4\\. Partner with an employee engagement survey vendor to design the\nsurvey**\n\n  \nThe design stage makes up a major portion of any employee engagement survey\nprocess. It is now that you formulate the questions, determine the total time\nthe survey will take, and accordingly finalize the questionnaire. Ideally, an\nemployee engagement survey shouldn\u2019t take more than 15 minutes to complete \u2013\n6\u201310 minutes is even better.\n\nAn employee engagement survey vendor will help you through this stage,\nformulating both quantifiable and unquantifiable questions, as well as open-\nended questions. Here's an example of each type:\n\n  * **Quantifiable question:** \u201cHow likely are you to recommend your workplace to friends and family? Rate from 1 (not likely at all) to 10 (very likely).\u201d\n  * **Unquantifiable question:** \u201cWhich factor makes you most excited to come to work? Choose between a) The free pantry, b) The flexible hours, or c) Friday fun at the workplace.\" \n  * **Open-ended question:** \u201cWhat, according to you, is the greatest strength of your company?\u201d\n\nAim to partner with vendors who offer a combination of both, preset employee\nengagement questionnaires and the option to customize the questionnaires for\norganization-specific findings if required in the future.\n\n### **5\\. Administer the survey**\n\n  \nEmployee engagement surveys serve no purpose unless they result in tangible\naction. A survey that\u2019s only good for collecting data, without action taken on\nyour part, will leave your employees feeling neglected and underwhelmed. They\nare less likely to participate in the next cycle of engagement surveys, even\nif you dramatically reduce the length of the questionnaire.\n\nThe first (and the easiest) action you can take is to share the survey results\nwith your employees. Work with your employee engagement survey vendor to\nvisually represent the data in an attractive format. This data can be shared\nin blogs, newsletters, and printed collaterals. Simultaneously, you can\nleverage predictive and prescriptive analytics to turn survey data into HR\ndecisions that must be actioned.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is Employee Appreciation?

By\nasking the right questions and generating accurate insights, you can pave the\nway for data-driven decisions in HR.\n\n### **1\\. Air Canada boosted engagement across diverse cultures**\n\n  \nAir Canada was looking to leverage employee engagement surveys spanning\n30,000+ employees from various parts of the world. The company chose a\nplatform that was focused on anonymity to eliminate the risk of bias. Employee\nwellness, support, and the office environment were identified as key\nobjectives of the survey process.\n\nAir Canada also shared the survey results across its workforce, reassuring\nemployee groups that their voice was being heard.\n\n### **2\\. Mott identified micro-pain points in the engagement**\n\n  \nManufacturing company Mott needed an employee engagement survey that could be\naccessed by on-floor workers who don\u2019t log into their emails every day. The\ncompany chose a mobile-first platform to send out pulse polls. Once pain\npoints were identified, Mott rolled out more detailed questionnaires to gather\ngranular data.\n\nBy replacing the annual survey with a format more conducive to the\nmanufacturing sector, Mott could significantly boost participation, achieving\nan exceptional 98% participation rate for its manager feedback survey.\n\n### **3\\. Vend optimized its engagement spends using surveys**\n\n  \nAustralia-based retail software company Vend wanted to know the top\ncontributing factor of employee engagement. This would help to optimize its HR\ninvestments. By opting for biannual employee engagement surveys, Vend detected\na 23% increase in the need for learning & development (L&D;). The company also\nachieved 90% employee participation in each survey, gaining confidence in the\nquality of employee feedback.\n\n**Learn More:**\n\n## **Final Takeaways**\n\nFor employees, the time and effort needed to complete surveys can be daunting,\nleading to low participation rates. However, it\u2019s impossible to deny the\nbenefits of engagement surveys, which is why they will continue to be a staple\nfor organizations.\n\nTo simplify the process of creating, administering, and obtaining results from\nemployee engagement surveys, you can:\n\n  * Define a set of common questions that can be used over multiple years to measure any variance\n  * Use sentiment analytics to extract insights from open-ended questions\n  * Ask about investments you think that may not be working to save HR spends\n  * Garner regular feedback to anticipate flight risk in high-value talent\n  * Ascertain clear employee insights to minimize bias/subjective opinion\n\n  \nFor organizations looking to develop an employee-centric culture, the voice of\nthe employee must have room for expression.

Sales leaders are also testing lower-cost\nsales models, according to Gartner. Metrics such as seller activities,\nproductivity, and customer engagement are being tracked to inform future\nbudget cuts.

Engagment](https://www.bmmagazine.co.uk/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/Depositphotos_102488478_l-2015-scaled-e1584654196253.jpg)\n\n## Almost half of HR professionals say enhanced employee engagement is the top\nstrategic HR priority within their organisation today, with one in five saying\nthat insights gleaned from employee engagement have a significant part to play\nin the future strategic direction of recruitment,\n\naccording to a recent independent study commissioned by live polling app\ntechnology company [Vevox](https://www.vevox.com/).\n\nHowever, challenges remain in this area, with 50% of HR leaders citing\nperceived lack of development opportunities as one of the top two biggest\norganisational challenges when it comes to attracting and retaining staff.\n\nIn addition, the study also found that two-fifths of the survey sample use\nstaff turnover rate as a key performance indicator of their internal\ncommunications strategy; and with a further 30% citing lack of employee\nrecognition and reward as an engagement obstacle.\n\nAnd with almost a third of polled HR professionals flagging increased employee\nretention (32%) and the ability to attract higher-quality staff as key\noutcomes of enhancing their employee engagement, it\u2019s clear that this needs to\nremain a key focus in order to attract and keep top talent.\n\nPete Eyre, Managing Director at Vevox, said: \u201cEmployee engagement is really\nbecoming instrumental in the strategic direction of businesses today. It\u2019s\ngreat to see how much it\u2019s starting to influence staff induction processes,\nwith organisations now using wider employee insights to inform their\nrecruitment and communication strategies, especially when it comes to\nmeasuring the positive impact of internal initiatives such as social events.\n\nHowever, there is still work to do. Most employees feel happier and more\nvalued when management listens to and addresses more of their ideas, so by\nputting this into practice, businesses can use employee insights to reduce\nturnover and help to bolster recruitment efforts.\u201d\n\nWith over half of HR professionals now using take-up of internal\ncommunications initiatives to measure the impact of their company\u2019s employee\nengagement strategy, it\u2019s clear that taking existing employees\u2019 ideas, needs\nand suggestions into account can vastly improve overall satisfaction levels:\nwith 38% referencing \u2018increased productivity\u2019, 34% saying \u2018recruitment becomes\neasier\u2019 and 28% citing \u2018lower employee churn\u2019 as key benefits. As such,\nrecruitment processes can benefit hugely from these insights.\n\nAs stated by Eyre: \u201cas employers start to realise that a strong employee\nengagement strategy can yield real results, we will see increasing levels of\ninvestment in internal comms and recruitment. Above all, the delivery of\nenhanced employee engagement will help businesses improve productivity, reduce\nemployee turnover, and attract talented individuals.\u201d\n\n### Sharing\n\n  * [__

last five years,\nor even in the past year, then it's probably just about the only thing in your\norganization that hasn't. Job postings should be reevaluated and rewritten\nevery time you need to hire. The author offers four suggestions for composing\nand positioning a job description: 1) Know what you need now, but also\nenvision the future. 2) Understand the hiring context. 3) Avoid limiting\nlanguage. 4) Think about meaning.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/03/Mar20_30_1147344231.jpg)\nWestend61/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/03/write-a-job-description-that-attracts-the-right-\ncandidate?language=es)\n\nFar too many organizations miss golden opportunities to bring onboard best\npossible talent for the tasks at hand \u2014 and those of the future. When it\u2019s\ntime to recruit, hire, and onboard, the most common approaches are routine and\nrote, prone to misjudgment and error. The process is costly and, in the end,\nunfruitful.\n\nThis failure begins at the very first step: writing the job description. As\ninternational talent management expert Dorothy Dalton\n[laments](https://dorothydalton.com/2016/02/25/why-copy-paste-recruitment-\nfails/?utm_source=ReviveOldPost&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ReviveOldPost),\n\u201cCopy-paste recruitment is generally business as usual in most\norganizations\u2026Even if the post was last filled five years ago, the chance of\nanyone thinking it might have to be crafted differently are slim. Generally,\nthe only changes I see are to inflate the qualifications.\u201d\n\nIf you think the job you\u2019re hiring for hasn\u2019t changed in the last five years \u2014\nor even in the past year \u2014 then it\u2019s probably just about the only thing in\nyour organization that hasn\u2019t. And the practice of [over-inflation of job\nqualifications](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/you-looking-hire-get-hired-\nhere-some-things-consider-whitney-johnson/) often discourages desirable\ncandidates to apply \u2014 candidates with potential who won\u2019t be easily bored in\nthe role. So instead of leaning on this these approaches, learn to pinpoint\nwhat you really need from a new hire in order to properly compose and position\nthe job description. Here are four suggestions:\n\n### **Know what you need now, but also envision the future.**\n\nThink of the job as an s-curve, with lots of room to grow in the role at the\nlow end of the \u201cs\u201d and high proficiency but little potential at the top end.\nIn most cases, I advocate hiring someone who will onboard at the low end and\nenjoy an enthusiastic and extended growth experience, with a commensurate\nlevel of job engagement, satisfaction, and productivity as they ascend the\ncurve to reach high proficiency.\n\n#### Insight Center\n\n  * ###### [The Era of Job Crafting](/insight-center/the-era-of-job-crafting)\n\nSponsored by Upwork\n\nDesign the work you want.\n\nSometimes, however, you need a sharpshooter with the expertise to solve a\npressing problem. You can\u2019t wait for them to grow. The tradeoff is that they\nwill quickly move on, either to another organization or to a new challenge in\nyours (if one is available for them) and you will need to hire again,\nhopefully for a longer tenure.\n\nBefore writing the job description, think about what will best serve the\norganization in both the short and long term. In some cases, it may be more\nappropriate to contract a gig worker to solve the problem and hire an employee\nfor longer-term growth.\n\n### **Understand the hiring context.**\n\nEvaluate the role in the context of the team in a large organization, or in\nthe whole organization if your workplace is on the smaller side. Filling a job\nis a growth opportunity for the business, not just for the individual; the\nbest fit is found when it captures growth for both. You can better align your\njob openings and descriptions with what your business needs by better\nunderstanding your current roles.\n\nFor example, we consulted with a company that had motivated mid-level managers\nwho were nonetheless uncertain about opportunities for advancement. This was\nespecially true for people who had worked in the organization for more than 10\nyears. As the company developed new jobs to be filled, we recommended that\nthey survey a targeted group of individuals related to the role they were\nhiring for. In the survey, they asked people to outline what they actually did\nversus the job description for their role. Questions included: Why do these\ndifferences exist? What has motivated or required them to do things\ndifferently than their job description would suggest? What tasks are\nassociated with the standard phrase \u201cand other jobs as specified?\u201d What\nchallenges have they faced and overcome to be successful? How is success\ngauged \u2014 what are the metrics used? And, finally, how long have they been in\nthis role?\n\nThe results of this type of survey can identify roles that need to be trimmed\nor pruned out altogether. It can facilitate proper allocation of valuable\nhuman resources and help identify opportunities for internal movement and\nadvancement of proven talent. You may even find you don\u2019t need an external\nhire at all, or that you need to hire for something different than the vacant\nposition. Ultimately, you will be properly informed when writing the job\ndescription if you know what current employees are doing and what they  _want_\nto be doing. The gaps will reveal themselves.\n\n### **Avoid limiting language.**\n\nAs I noted earlier, the goal of a job description is to invite applicants. To\ndo this successfully, avoid limiting language. [Gender-biased\nlanguage](https://www.topechelon.com/blog/owner-issues/gender-biased-language-\nin-job-descriptions/), for example, is known to discourage possible\ncandidates. This is perhaps especially true of women when language is overly\nmasculine (examples include words like \u201coutspoken,\u201d \u201ccompetitive,\u201d and\n\u201cninja\u201d). But it is not limited to them. Men are also discouraged by feminine\nlanguage (\u201cnurturing,\u201d \u201ccollaborative,\u201d or \u201cloyal\u201d), particularly in postings\nfor traditionally women-dominated jobs, like nursing.\n\nSimilarly, careless language can discourage minority applicants or\nunconventional ones such as on-rampers (how would a term like \u201ccareer-\noriented\u201d sound?), gig workers seeking traditional employment (ditto), or even\nentry-level workers (very discouraged by the word \u201cexperienced\u201d). If a job\nreally doesn\u2019t require two years of prior experience, don\u2019t claim it does. If\nyou\u2019re trying to diversify your workforce (and I hope you are) then include\nlanguage specifically inviting diverse interest. For example, \u201cWe are\ncommitted to diversity in our workforce.\u201d Kristen Pressner, the global head of\nhuman resources for Roche Diagnostics, advocates that we [\u201cflip it to\ntest\u201d](https://diginomica.com/flip-it-to-test-it-lessons-on-battling-bias-\nfrom-roche) our language: If you are a man, how might your language sound to a\nwoman? If you\u2019re white, how might the job description read for a person of\ncolor? If you\u2019re a driven career person, would what you\u2019ve crafted invite an\napplicant who needs to work from home? Also test the language you use with a\ndiverse group of individuals before you post. They can help illuminate your\nblind spots.\n\n### **Think about meaning.**\n\nPeople want to contribute, to feel energized and passionate about what they\ndo. They want to be inspired by ideas that can help solve problems and meet\nneeds. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean changing the world or addressing\ncosmically important issues. But it does mean believing that we are making our\ncorner of the world happier, brighter, and safer in some small but significant\nway.\n\nIt is critical that organizations ensure the roles they are hiring for are\nquality opportunities for meaningful work, personal growth, and impact. This\nneeds to be conveyed through the job description and even into the\ninterviewing process. For example, Chatbooks is a company that helps people\ncreate printed scrapbooks from their Instagram photos. Rather than focusing on\nspecific skills, they use words like \u201chigh-performance creativity,\u201d \u201cgrown\nup,\u201d and \u201coptimistic\u201d to describe their values and the kind of candidates they\nare seeking to employ. When you hire an individual whose values align with the\npurposes of your organization, it\u2019s a win-win. Craft the job description to\ninvite those people to apply.\n\nWhen you get a job description right, you provide an opportunity for your next\nemployee to assume market risk \u2014 to play where others in your organization\naren\u2019t, utilizing their distinctive strengths. The odds of success are much\nhigher than if they face competitive risk, battling for turf with entrenched\nplayers in your organization. The right fit means that a new hire has room to\ngrow; when your employees grow, so does your organization.\n\n* * *\n\n[Whitney Johnson](/search?term=whitney%20johnson&search_type=search-all) is an\nexecutive coach, speaker, and innovation thinker recently named one of the\nmost influential management thinkers by Thinkers50.

Employees Need From Leaders Right\nNow](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/gd__nha3b02d9dwoozwb4q.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * Gallup studied past crises to learn what leaders can do during COVID-19\n  * Primarily, people need leaders to provide a path forward\n  * Use five survey items to audit your leadership approach\n\nHow do you lead and inspire employees amid a global pandemic that's creating\nanxiety and uncertainty everywhere?\n\nThis is the most unusual and unpredictable crisis most of us have experienced\nin our lives. But there's no need to start from scratch in trying to confront\nit.\n\nGallup has studied global citizens' worries, fears and confidence during\nnearly every major crisis of the past eight decades -- including the Great\nDepression, Pearl Harbor and World War II, the Kennedy assassination,\nupheavals and riots in the 1960s, 9/11, the 2008 global financial crash, and\nnow the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOne thing is clear. Global citizens look to leadership to provide a path --\nand to provide confidence that there is a way forward that they can contribute\nto.\n\nIn times of crisis, there are two directions human nature can take us: fear,\nhelplessness and victimization -- or self-actualization and engagement. On the\nlatter, if leaders have a clear way forward, human beings are amazingly\nresilient. There is a documented \"rally effect.\"\n\nGallup meta-analytics have found four universal needs that followers have of\nleaders:\n\n  * Trust\n  * Compassion\n  * Stability\n  * Hope\n\nIf leaders have a clear way forward, human beings are amazingly resilient.\nThere is a documented \"rally effect.\"\n\nThese needs are especially urgent during crises. People look for these traits\nin their leaders as a signal that their life will be OK and that they can be\npart of the solution.\n\n### **How to Audit Your Leadership Approach During COVID-19**\n\nTo help leaders audit whether they are meeting these four needs and gauge what\ntheir people are thinking, Gallup reviewed past research, applied it to the\ncurrent COVID-19 crisis, and developed a very short pulse survey that you can\nsend out -- and get a high response rate in only two days.\n\nWe invested in this research and ongoing tracking as a public service. You can\nexecute this tool and get feedback on how you are doing _today_. You can use\nyour own preferred platform [or the Gallup Access\nplatform](https://www.gallup.com/access/239201/employee-surveys.aspx).\n\nThe tool includes five items built around the most important actionable\norganizational practices that will increase trust, compassion, stability and\nhope:\n\n### **1\\. My leadership has a clear plan of action.**\n\nCurrent Gallup tracking shows that only 39% of U.S. employees strongly agree\nthat their employer has communicated a clear plan of action in response to\nCOVID-19.\n\n### **2\\. I feel well-prepared to do my job.**\n\nJust over half of employees (54%) strongly agree that, considering the recent\nimpact of COVID-19 on their job, they feel well-prepared to do their work. We\nare all adapting to this massive disruption.\n\nA [Gallup meta-\nanalysis](https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&parterref=article&utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_292334&utm_medium=copy&eventid=2227447&sessionid=1&key=9B313EDC59F0101EBD44901C0C8CAB0B&regTag=&sourcepage=register)\nhas found that during high-stress times, managers need to go back to the\nbasics of clarifying expectations, reviewing material and equipment needs, and\nreadjusting roles so that people can leverage their strengths in new ways.\nFurther, each employee needs to see how they fit into the bigger picture of\nthe organization -- its mission and purpose.\n\n### **3\\. My supervisor keeps me informed about what is going on.**\n\nThe supervisor or manager is [the key\nconduit](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/258197/why-leaders-employees-trust-\ndon.aspx), responsible for translating the organization's response to COVID-19\nfor each employee. Only [the direct\nmanager](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/259469/manager-experience-shapes-\nemployee-experience.aspx) can know each employee's situation, keep them\ninformed, and adjust expectations, coaching and accountability to inspire high\nperformance.\n\nLess than half of employees (48%) strongly agree that their immediate\nsupervisor keeps them informed about what is going on in the organization as\nit relates to the impact of COVID-19.\n\n### **4\\. My organization cares about my wellbeing.**\n\nBefore the novel coronavirus outbreak, work and life were more blended than\never before. Now, with millions of people required to work from home and with\nmillions of kids kept home from school, blending work and life is even more\ncomplicated -- and it's creating all kinds of unprecedented stress on\nemployees' wellbeing.\n\nA key predictor of low worry and high confidence is whether each employee\nbelieves, and experiences, that the organization is looking out for their best\ninterest.\n\nGallup has found [five elements of\nwellbeing](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/215924/well-being.aspx) that each\norganization can act on in many different ways: career, social, financial,\ncommunity and physical. When asked to consider the recent impact of COVID-19,\nless than half of employees (45%) strongly agree that their organization cares\nabout their overall wellbeing.\n\nA key predictor of low worry and high confidence is whether each employee\nbelieves, and experiences, that the organization is looking out for their best\ninterest.\n\n### **5\\. Over the past 24 hours, how often have you been practicing social\ndistancing?**\n\nScientists studying COVID-19, designing sophisticated models and projections,\nbelieve extreme measures of social distancing will be necessary to flatten the\ncurve of this pandemic.\n\nEmployers play a major role in setting the expected norms, reinforcing what\nhas proven to work in flattening the curve -- and the essential role employees\nplay -- so that everyone can get back to \"normal\" life sooner rather than\nlater.\n\nWe are fortunate to have technology to keep us together. But we all now have a\nresponsibility to do something temporarily that defies our human nature -- to\ndistance ourselves socially.\n\n> Only 27% of U.S. employees, as of March 19, say they \"always\" practice\n> social distancing. Another 40% say they practice social distancing \"very\n> often.\"\n\n### **Use Gallup 's COVID-19 Leadership Audit Today**\n\nGallup has found that the below Leadership Audit can be completed with a high\nresponse rate in a two-day window. You will quickly know how effectively you\nare responding to COVID-19. We recommend you [use this tool\nimmediately](https://www.gallup.com/access/239201/employee-surveys.aspx).\n\n![Custom graphic.

The jury has been\nout on what constitutes the perfect employee engagement survey, and views vary\nwidely about the ideal length, depth, and nature of questions. That said,\ncertain questions dig deeper and unearth useful information, whereas others\nsimply add to the length of the survey. In this article, you will find a list\nof the top 20 questions you should consider incorporating into your employee\nengagement survey for 2020._**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834cadce393.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nWhile there are questionnaires like the Gallup Employee Engagement Survey,\nwhich includes only 12 questions, for example, most employee engagement (EE)\nsurveys tend to fall between the range of 35\u201350 questions, divided into\nthemes. These themes are essential because they provide employees with frames\nof reference, such as general satisfaction levels, job-specific questions,\nquestions about the leadership, person-organization value orientation, safety,\ncommunication processes, team dynamics, **[learning and\ndevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/what-is-learning-and-development-objectives-strategy/)** , and\nbenefits administration.\n\nGallup defines employee engagement based on three specific metrics \u2013\ninvolvement/absorption, enthusiasm, and commitment. And there are three ways\nto gauge these facets of EE:\n\n  * **Anchor questions to measure the overall level of engagement,** split into how involved or immersed employees feel at work, how enthusiastic they are about work every day, and whether they are sustainably committed to their job and the organization)\n  * **Direct questions about drivers of engagement** , which look at all aspects of work that can drive or deter engagement\n  * **Open-ended survey questions,** which allow employees the freedom to think deeper and explain how they feel to ensure that the individual voice is not left out of the survey\n\n  \nYou cannot **[measure employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/hr-\nexperts-on-how-to-measure-employee-engagement/) **with a survey that is not\nengaging. The market is rife with employee engagement survey vendors who could\nmake your life easier.\n\nBut with most of us often dealing with a pre-programmed aversion to surveys in\ngeneral, how can you formulate an EE survey that makes employees _want_ to\ntake it and to answer all questions honestly?\n\nThe anonymity of responses is a great way to ensure honesty and increased\nparticipation in engagement surveys. In addition, to enable greater\nparticipation, the survey could be hosted on mobile apps or as mini-surveys\nover the intranet so that it does not feel like yet another task or chore.\n\nCompanies such as Hyphen allow you to deliver these surveys through their own\nplatforms, have mobile-first platforms, and will enable you to visualize data\nthat tells stories. Some platforms also allow you to customize survey\nquestions so that you can ask event-specific questions in your organization.\n\nSituational questions often engage better since they make employees draw from\ntheir own experiences or think about a possible behavior outcome.\n\nHere are 20 questions to help you with that.\n\n**Learn More:**[What Is Employee Engagement? Definition, Drivers, Strategies,\nMeasures, and Technologies](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-engagement/)\n\n## **20 Employee Engagement Survey Questions You Should Not Miss in 2020**\n\nThe following questions establish an index of engagement, assess the direct\ninfluencers of organizational culture, such as leadership, alignment with\ncompany goals, and enablement, and aim to identify additional information\nregarding deterrents to engagement (through open-ended questions).\n\nQuestions 1 through 17 are multiple-choice questions, with (a) and (b) being\npositive responses, (c) being a neutral response, and (d) and (e) being\nnegative responses. Questions 18,19 and 20 are open-ended, requiring employees\nto introspect and provide more elaborate answers.\n\nWhether an employee feels enabled at work or not is key to better performance,\ndeeper engagement, and increased levels of generalized happiness at work. Your\n2020 employee engagement questionnaire should be invested in finding out\nwhether employees feel that they work in an enabling culture \u2013 a culture that\ngives them all the resources they need to perform their jobs efficiently.\n\nSimilarly, with the growing collaborative culture between leadership and\nemployees, your 2020 survey questions need to explore the three-fold role of\nany leader \u2013 communicating effectively, leading by example, and motivating\nefforts towards attaining the corporate vision.\n\nHere's a list of 20 questions that should be a part of your 2020 employee\nengagement questionnaire.\n\n**1. _You're at a family get-together, and someone asks you where you work.\nHow do you respond?_**\n\n_a) Tell them the name of the company, positive that they will recognize it_\n\n_b) Tell them the name and give a short introduction to help them understand\nbetter_\n\n_c) Give them the name while wondering whether they have heard of the company_\n\n_d) Tell them the name of the company while being confident that they have not\nheard of it_\n\n_e) Don\u2019t tell them the name but just mention the industry or sector_\n\n  \nThis question quickly sets the tone for the survey and lets you know whether\nan employee would be proud to talk about where they work and how eager they\nwould be to explain more about their organization to an outsider.\n\nScores on this question give you an idea of how strongly affiliated the\nemployee is to the employer brand and how sure they are that their\nacquaintances would know about the organization. Being a question that\nexplores pride in and an emotional connection to the employer brand, more\nnegative responses would indicate that the person is unsure about how to\nproject the brand.\n\n**2. _Your close friend is looking for a job and asks whether there are any\nopenings at your organization. What is your response?_**\n\n_a) Tell them that it\u2019s a great idea, take an active interest in looking up\nvacancies, and ask them to get in touch with the relevant managers_\n\n_b) Ask them to visit the company website and to let you know if any role\nstands out so that you can take it from there_\n\n_c) You take some time to consider whether they would fit in and then help\nout_\n\n_d) Tell them that you\u2019ll check and let them know while wondering why anyone\nwould want to work at XYZ_\n\n_e) Warn them that XYZ is the worst choice and that they should steer clear\neven if they were desperate for a job_\n\n  \nThis question gives you a peek into the **[employee net promoter score\n(eNPS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/employee-\nnet-promoter-score-enps-definition-measurement-examples-ideas/)**. However, it\nis not uncommon for employees to strongly recommend an organization to others\nwhile being fairly certain that they will eventually quit.\n\nThis might also be because they feel that others could gain out of the pay and\nperks even though the culture is not great (or vice versa) for them.\nRegardless, this is an excellent way to understand whether your employees have\nevolved into active employer brand ambassadors.\n\nA neutral response (c) here could be an indicator that the employee wishes to\nraise concerns about daily processes at work, whereas a negative response (d)\nor (e) needs to be explored further to understand whether the employee has had\na serious negative experience at work.\n\n**3. _You\u2019re on a social media platform like LinkedIn sharing a post by XYZ\nwhen you notice the \u201cjobs\u201d tab. What do you do?_**\n\n_a) Nothing. Finish sharing a post, browse through the news feed, and log out.\nI love working at XYZ!_\n\n_b) Don't click on the tab but wonder whether there are any exciting roles_\n\n_c) Check whether my HR can view my openness to other roles and quickly glance\nat the job postings_\n\n_d) Go through the job posts while being unsure of whether to apply or not,\nthough some look very tempting_\n\n_e) That \u201cjobs\u201d tab was the reason I got on LinkedIn in the first place!_\n\n  \nThis statement explores the employee\u2019s existing commitment to the\norganization. For employees who are truly engaged at work, the thought of\nlooking out for another job is often something that they have not invested any\ntime in at all.\n\nAnd this can be a direct indicator of possible attrition in your organization.\nYou can use the response to device a thorough retention strategy that makes\nemployees stay for the long haul.\n\n**4. _Where do you see yourself in 2 years?_**\n\n_a) Growing in my present role_\n\n_b) Being promoted to the next step at XYZ_\n\n_c) In another position more suited for me at XYZ_\n\n_d) Considering moving jobs_\n\n_e) As far away from XYZ as possible_\n\n  \nThis is a follow-up to the previous question and adds a time frame to the\nanalysis of the employee\u2019s commitment to the job. To understand the overall\nretention index, asking questions 3 and 4 is helpful since you get an insight\ninto immediate and long-term commitment trends.\n\n**5. _Your manager asks you to do a small task over the weekend? What do you\ndo?_**\n\n_a) I do it willingly knowing there is a valid reason for the urgency_\n\n_b) I ask my manager why it has to be done over the weekend so that I am\nbetter-informed_\n\n_c) I finish it off as quickly as possible without investing much time or\neffort_\n\n_d) I get it done but grumble about it to my colleagues, my family, and\npossibly my manager as well_\n\n_e) I don\u2019t work on weekends. Period._\n\n  \nThis question looks into the aspect of discretionary effort.\n\n  * Do your employees feel motivated to do their best?\n  * Do they feel that they have the flexibility to go above and beyond their job descriptions?\n  * Would they willingly put in effort beyond working hours?\n\n  \nThese critical questions look at an employee's intrinsic motivation.\nMotivation is an important metric to study for companies that operate in low-\ntenure sectors like recruitment or hospitality, for example, where the scores\non commitment tend to be low.\n\nA low score on this might indicate more than just low motivation \u2013 it could be\na sign that employees feel a lack of enabling leaders or do not perceive the\nculture to be one that they feel connected to.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Employee Engagement vs. Job Satisfaction: Key Differences\nand Metrics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-engagement-vs-job-satisfaction-differences/)**\n\n**6. _You're a little unsure about a new process that will be implemented at\nwork. What do you do?_**\n\n_a) I ask any of the leaders about it since they are accessible and willing to\nexplain all changes and implementations_\n\n_b) I ask my immediate manager about it_\n\n_c) I ask my colleagues first_\n\n_d) I'm unsure about whom to ask, so I try to figure it out myself_\n\n_e) I don\u2019t feel comfortable asking anyone for fear of being judged for asking\ntoo many questions_\n\n  \nHow well and frequently leaders communicate the internal happenings and\nworkings of the organization to all employees is an important driver of\nengagement. It also indicates how involved and transparent employees perceive\ntheir leaders to be.\n\nAs we progressively move away from hierarchies and organizations become\nflatter, getting higher scores on this question becomes even more critical.\nLower scores demand a closer look at opportunities for improvement in internal\ncommunications processes.\n\n**7. _A colleague tells you that managers at XYZ should start practicing what\nthey preach. How do you respond?_**\n\n_a) Disagree vehemently, arguing that managers do practice what they preach_\n\n_b) Ask them why they feel this way and try to help them see that they might\nbe judging too fast_\n\n_c) Listen to them patiently and wonder whether they are right_\n\n_d) Check to see if any manager is within earshot and then agree with them_\n\n_e) Agree completely_\n\n  \nThis question looks at how the employee perceives the manager to fit into the\nbigger picture of the organization.\n\nDo your employees feel that the manager is an effective role model? Do they\nfeel that organizational leaders lead by example?\n\nThis is an important metric of employee engagement since leaders (both those\nwho directly manage the employee and those who employees indirectly report to)\nserve as a liaison between the organization, its processes, and the employee.\nMoreover, in organizations where managers lead by example, employees get a\nfirst-hand sense of living the values and vision of the brand.\n\nMore negative responses here demand the creation of better training\nopportunities for managers. These opportunities must be geared to help them\ndevelop skills that would help them sustain positive change and scale-up.\n\n**8. _When someone from your family asks you what you do, how do you describe\nyour role?_**\n\n_a) I tell them in detail what XYZ does and how my role fits into the bigger\npicture_\n\n_b) I give them a brief overview of my job description_\n\n_c) I gloss over the basic tasks that I am engaged in daily_\n\n_d) I tell them the sector that XYZ caters to and my designation_\n\n_e) I tell them my job title, but that I have no idea what my role because I\ndon't see it serving a direct purpose_\n\n  \nThis is the next step in the communication of the overall vision, mission, and\ngoals of the organization. The question explores whether leaders have been\nsuccessful in making the employee realize where their own role features in the\nbigger picture and how what they do individually matters.\n\nThis question is also based upon our need to feel connected to something\ngreater than us and feeling motivated to attain higher goals.\n\n**9. _When your friend asks you how hectic your job is, what do you say?_**\n\n_a) It's may be hectic, but it is gratifying, and I feel supported at work_\n\n_b) I have good days and bad days, but I have most of the resources I need to\nhandle expectations_\n\n_c) It does get a little hectic at times_\n\n_d) It gets hectic often, and more organizational support would improve\nthings_\n\n_e) It is too hectic, and I am beginning to wonder if this is the right job\nfor me_\n\n  \nAllowing employees access to all resources (tools, platforms, software,\nflexibility, processes, etc.) that they need to work to their optimum\npotential and to develop their skills further is a basic necessity to ensure\nengagement, growth, and retention. How employees feel about work depends a lot\non the resources they have to work with.\n\nDo they feel the pressure of having to deliver optimal success despite working\nin an environment that does not meet their needs and expectations?\n\nNegative scores would indicate a direct link to disengagement, but they\nwarrant more in-depth exploration with open-ended questions. Moreover, they\nmight also suggest that employees feel that the expectations from them are\nunfair since they are not in an environment most conducive to high\nperformance.\n\n**10. _Your college-mate asks you whether you ever wonder about going back to\nacademics. What is your response?_**\n\n_a) I have an abundance of learning opportunities at work to help me grow, so\nI never miss it_\n\n_b) I cannot complain since I have access to enough courses and learning\ntechnologies at work_\n\n_c) I do miss it at times_\n\n_d) I am considering a few learning opportunities independently since XYZ does\nnot fund it_\n\n_e) I am losing interest in learning and developing my skills altogether\nbecause XYZ does not promote a learning culture_\n\n  \nWhether your employees feel they have access to the right resources or not to\ndo their job well at present, another point to take note of is whether they\nfeel the same about future possibilities of learning and growth.\n\nEmployees feel more engaged in environments that offer intellectual support\nfor the expansion of skills and the deepening of knowledge pools. A culture of\nlearning motivates individuals to do better in an environment that helps them\nbe better.\n\nNegative responses indicate that your workforce experiences a shortage of\nlearning opportunities. This would be the time to develop a full-scale\nlearning and development strategy to bring back those employees whose interest\nin work and learning is waning. It would also help keep motivated employees\ninterested in their roles.\n\n**Learn More:[15 Essential Employee Satisfaction Survey Questions for Your\n2020 Questionnaire](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-satisfaction-survey-questions/)**\n\n**11. _When a colleague asks you if you feel your time is wasted in\nmeaningless processes, what do you say?_**\n\n_a) Every process is perfectly efficient and effective, and I wouldn\u2019t change\na thing_\n\n_b) Yes, some of the processes are a little convoluted, but they serve their\npurpose_\n\n_c) Some of the processes could be revisited and made more efficient_\n\n_d) Sometimes my time is wasted in meaningless processes_\n\n_e) Yes, my time is wasted in a lot of trivial processes_\n\n  \nThe word \u201cadequate\u201d here might seem to be leading but is a conscious choice to\nmake the survey participants ponder over whether they have \u201cenough\u201d or \u201cmostly\nenough\u201d of requisite systems.\n\nMost organizations would not have \u201call\u201d systems that employees need or want.\nThe point of the question, however, is to check what the organization scores\nagainst employee expectations.\n\nThis is a broader view of enablement \u2013 an organization-wide infrastructure\nthat helps employees get things done efficiently. Negative responses should\ncall for immediate analysis of present systems to understand where investment\nand improvement are required.\n\n**12. _A friend who is disappointed in their own job asks you how you find\nmeaning in what you do. What do you tell them?_**\n\n_a) It becomes a lot easier to find meaning when you know that every little\nthing that you do serves a bigger purpose_\n\n_b) It helps to take a step back and look at how your role helps further the\norganization\u2019s goals_\n\n_c) I remind myself of my purpose at work_\n\n_d) I feel a lack of meaning at times as well, and I can empathize with you_\n\n_e) There is a total mismatch between what I do, my goals, and XYZ\u2019s\nobjectives, and that makes it challenging for me to find meaning at work_\n\n  \nTo feel engaged, involved, and absorbed at work, employees must feel a clear\nsense of alignment between the employee and the organization about the values,\ngoals, and vision for the future.\n\nThis is the first level of overall alignment \u2013 role alignment \u2013 to know what\none's tasks and duties are. Without this awareness, there can be no further\nalignment with the bigger picture and no deeper level of engagement.\n\nA large number of negative responses here are indicators of misalignment.\nHowever, this answer needs to be mapped against the duration for which the\nemployee has been in the organization.\n\nMany organizations find it practical to conduct employee engagement surveys\nfor new employees separately since it would be unfair to expect them to\npossess the same level of alignment with organizational goals as employees who\nhave served a longer tenure.\n\n**13. _When you feel that you have accomplished something at work, big or\nsmall, what usually follows?_**\n\n_a) I\u2019m treated like a superstar for achieving it no matter how big or small\nan accomplishment it is_\n\n_b) I feel appreciated and rewarded most of the time_\n\n_c) I try to tell my colleagues about it since they might not notice\notherwise_\n\n_d) I feel that it would be nice if XYZ could make a bigger deal of my\nachievements_\n\n_e) Nothing \u2013 I know that it will not be recognized, so I go back to what I\nwas doing, feeling unappreciated_\n\n  \nRewards and recognition are a crucial aspect of engagement. Without\nrecognition for the alignment between efforts and outcomes, there is a strong\nchance that employees may find themselves disengaged in the workplace.\n\n[Social recognition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/rewards-and-\nrecognition/what-is-social-recognition/) is a great way to boost motivation\nsince it caters to two of the needs in Maslow\u2019s hierarchy \u2013 self-esteem and\nthe need to belong.\n\nMore negative responses indicate that not only are employees not feeling\nappreciated enough but also that they might be confused about what defines the\nsuccess of their role in the organization.\n\n**14. _A colleague asks you whether you ever feel like nothing will change for\nthe better at XYZ. What do you say?_**\n\n_a) XYZ is always changing for the better_\n\n_b) There are quite a few aspects where you see XYZ trying to improve\ncontinuously_\n\n_c) Maybe some facets of work need more focused change_\n\n_d) At times, it does feel that there is a sense of complacency through the\norganization_\n\n_e) Yes, we're all doomed, and nothing will ever get better_\n\n  \nThis is an essential point of long-term goal alignment. A culture of\ncontinuous improvement is not seen only in terms of big decisions but makes\nitself felt in the smallest everyday aspects of work. This holds especially\ntrue for high-performing, fast-growth companies.\n\nIf your employees are giving greater negative responses here, it would be wise\nto dig deeper into understanding where the bottlenecks are. They could exist\nin employee learning and development, in the organization's complacency toward\na fluid culture and adapting to new ways of work, the approach to employees\u2019\ncareer development, and so on.\n\n**15. _Your manager asks you where you see your career headed. What do you\nsay?_**\n\n_a) I am happy with the career path that has been mapped out at XYZ based on\nmy aspirations_\n\n_b) I know the general milestones and am glad to grow with the organization_\n\n_c) I see an immediate career progression within XYZ but want a more tangible\nplan_\n\n_d) I am not clear about how my career can progress within XYZ_\n\n_e) I don\u2019t see a future at XYZ since my aspirations don\u2019t match with the path\nset out for me_\n\nBuilding on the need to learn and grow, an environment that allows ample\nopportunities for holistic development automatically generates deeper\nengagement. Do your employees feel that their career paths matter? Managerial\ninterest in an employee\u2019s growth through the organization is always viewed as\na positive involvement.\n\nEngaged employees tend to feel more valued at work, and having a career path\nchalked out adds to the idea that organizational leaders want to invest in\ntheir growth over time.\n\nIf employees demonstrate a lack of clarity about their career within the\norganization or state that they don\u2019t see a future here, you will need to\nretrace your steps to see why they do feel so, and how their managers can\ncreate their paths of advancements.\n\n**16. _Your family asks you whether you\u2019re happy in your career. What is your\nresponse?_**\n\n_a) I am pleased since my job at XYZ is the best move to further my\nprofessional goals_\n\n_b) I\u2019m happy since XYZ is a good stepping stone_\n\n_c) XYZ would be a good stepping stone onto better prospects_\n\n_d) I\u2019m not overly satisfied with where I am in my career at present_\n\n_e) I regret accepting the job at XYZ_\n\n  \nThis question delves into the employee\u2019s perception of the value that their\npresent role adds to their career on the whole. This is an essential metric\nsince employees should believe in every career move if you want them to be\ngenuinely engaged.\n\nIf they feel that this job is a step backward in their career, they will end\nup treating work as an obligation they are bound to maybe to pay the bills.\n\nLower scores would signify that employees feel a lack of career-centric value\nand scope for growth.\n\n**17. _If your manager asks you whether you are keen to explore a skill or\ncareer development plan, how would you respond?_**\n\n_a) Jump at the offer and say I need more support in expanding my skills_\n\n_b) I would be keen to understand the skills development options on the table_\n\n_c) I would be skeptical, wondering whether they are trying to help or trying\nto put me down_\n\n_d) I would say that some more support would be great_\n\n_e) I would say that I'm always eager to learn but also emphasize that I have\nall the help I need to develop myself holistically thanks to XYZ_\n\n  \nDo your employees feel that they have the opportunity to develop their current\nskills while also picking up new skills that would help them in their careers\nin general?\n\nThis question supports the previous questions on learning and growth. It is\nalways a good idea to approach the same topic through different angles to make\nan objective analysis.\n\nEmployees may feel more valued when they learn that the company is keen on\ninvesting in their skill development, which may not be relevant to the\nemployee\u2019s immediate role but which might help them later.\n\nLow scores on this question demand immediate redressal. You would not want\nyour employees to feel that their growth is immaterial to the organization,\nespecially in the years to come, where the battle for the best talent is only\nlikely to get tougher.\n\n**Learn More:[20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-\nemployee-engagement-ideas/)**\n\n**Open-ended questions**\n\n18\\. _What are the things that you love about working here?_\n\n19\\. _What aspects of work make you hate Monday mornings?_\n\n20\\. _Did we miss out on something that you wish to talk about?_\n\n  \nThe idea with the open-ended questions above is to get the subjective side of\nthe story. While the multiple-choice questions help you obtain objective\nresponses, you often need more information that corroborates the choices that\nemployees made on the scale. This is your opportunity to let them provide\nopen-ended feedback and explain their answers.\n\n## **Start Asking the Right Questions**\n\nNow that you have your guide to the 20 essential questions to ask in your 2020\nemployee engagement survey, make sure to take a few steps to make your survey\na success.\n\nThese steps include creating a campaign around the survey, with communication\nto go out pre-survey as well as after it. The idea is to not only generate\nsome buzz around it and ensure participation but also to set the tone for the\nsurvey and explain the reasons for it.\n\nAnother thing to make clear to your employees is that they are not under\n\u201csurvey\u201dllance! The survey is not a way to monitor your employees, and the\nbetter they understand that, the more honest their responses will be.\n\nCommunicate clearly that the level of engagement is a score for the\norganization, not a metric that they are measured against. You could conduct a\ndemonstration to show them how their responses are recorded anonymously to\nreassure them about this.\n\nThe future of work requires that we change the metrics we measure in the\nworkplace. The questions in this list cater to the changing drivers of\nengagement, namely leadership, communication, and alignment with the company\nvision. With the right questions, you could bring out a wealth of information\nthat will help you engage better and build meaningful employee experiences in\n2020 and beyond.\n\n**Learn more** : **[Top 10 Employee Engagement Apps for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/top-\nemployee-engagement-apps/)**\n\n_What kind of employee engagement survey questions do you think work best?\nTell us all about it on_\n[_Facebook_](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=3645&zd_term=prarthanaghosh&zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=4057&zd_term=prarthanaghosh)\n_,_ [_LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-\ntechnologist/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=3645&zd_term=prarthanaghosh&zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=4057&zd_term=prarthanaghosh)\n_, or_\n[_Twitter_](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist?lang=en??zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=3645&zd_term=prarthanaghosh&zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=4057&zd_term=prarthanaghosh)\n_.

workers and self-employed - total workforce management (TWM)\nis more important than ever. Its integrated approach to recruitment, retention\nand talent management provides organisations a range of forward-looking\nbenefits._\n\nOver the past few years, a number of external developments have accelerated\nthe advent of total workforce management. First, the acquisition, retention\nand deployment of the right talent has against a backdrop of a tightening\nlabour market sparked a true war for talent. As such, organisations have to\nfind new, creative ways to attract and retain talent at the right cost.\n\nSecond, the labour market is moving towards a 'gig economy', with a growing\nnumber of organisations tapping into the power of gig workers for temporary\nassignments or projects. And third, changing demands from professionals\nthemselves means that career paths are now fluid, forcing companies to take a\nmore strategic, long term view to talent management and workforce needs.\n\nAccording to a survey from Ardent Partners, today 9% of organisations have a\nmature total workforce management practice in place, and just over half (58%)\nare either sitting on or executing plans to implement the approach in the\ncoming period. Illustrating the growing awareness among HR leaders to reap the\nbenefits of total workforce management.\n\n![The benefits of total workforce\nmanagement](/illustrations/news/detail/2020-04-03-131501469-The-benefits-of-\ntotal-workforce-management.jpg)\n\nSo what are these benefits then? According to consutants from Quintop\nManagement Consultants, a Netherlands-based human capital consultancy, they\ncan broadly be broken down into five categories.\n\n**Better decision making  \n** The quality level of creating and directing business plans, budgeting and\noperational planning significantly improves, which enables the organisation to\nincrease its agility, react quicker to trends and make better decisions.\n\n**Engagement  \n** By managing the workforce as a collective, such as giving internal\nemployees and flex workers the opportunity to join the same trainings and\nworkshops, organisations create a stronger link and connection among all\nemployees. This not only makes employees more responsible, but also stimulates\ninnovation, which often emerges where different groups come together.\n\n**Attracting talent  \n** Organisations are in a better position to proactively attract talent, at a\nlower cost and with less risk, which in return improves the organisations'\nlevel of flexibility. This is important as the labour market changes\nconstantly, including changes in law and regulation.\n\n**Improved visibility  \n** By using a system that lists available job postings in a transparent way\nand allows permanent employees and flex workers to respond to vacancies,\ncompanies 'unlock' their own people's potential, which creates a competitive\nadvantage for the organisation.\n\n**Flexibility  \n** Total workforce management is flexible in increasing and decreasing the\nnumber of resources, without losing quality. Success is not about internal\nemployees or flex workers but attracting the right people.\n\n## **Implementing TWM**\n\nFor total workforce management to be implemented successfully, Quintop's\nexperts stress that two key success factors need to be in place. First, a\nstrong collaboration between human resources and procurement. Traditionally,\nHR's role is to attract, develop and manage the workforce. As such, HR views\ncontingent labour as a means to access job candidates.\n\nProcurement's job meanwhile is to manage risk, costs and contracts. Hence,\ncontingent labour is seen as the most cost-effective way to attract resources.\nIn reality, the functions do not always join forces when it comes to total\nworkforce management. By breaking down their departmental siloes, human\nresources and procurement should be able to manage their interests while being\nmotivated to work toward a common goal.\n\nBesides collaboration, total workforce management secondly requires management\nand leadership; stakeholders need to be aligned and activities require\ncoordination. The implementation requires a clear vision, purpose and\nstrategy, supported by senior leadership that spreads the message, to cascade\nkey messages and build awareness and commitment.\n\n  * [

admitted to searching for new jobs or speaking\nwith recruiters while at work.\n\nBy: [Shawn Liew](https://hrmasia.com/author/shawn-liew/ \"Posts by Shawn Liew\")\n| March 23, 2020\n\nTopics: [News](https://hrmasia.com/category/main/news/) |\n[Singapore](https://hrmasia.com/category/markets/singapore/)\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/39197253_m.jpg)\n\nRemoved from guilt, some Singapore workers have actively searched for new\ncareer opportunities or spoken with a recruiter during working hours. In the\n\u201cUnapologetic Employees and Job Seekers\u201d online survey commissioned by\nRandstad Singapore and conducted by YouGov Singapore, 60% of 1,056 local-based\nrespondents admitted seeking pastures new while still being actively employed.\nMore pertinently perhaps, 49% do not find that their actions constitute to any\nwrongdoing.\n\nOn their part, employers need to recognise that when employees are set on\nresigning, they tend to demonstrate lower levels of loyalty and engagement,\nsaid Jaya Doss, managing director, Singapore and Malaysia at Randstad. \u201cThere\nare tell-tale signs of disengaged employees, such as poorer productivity and\nabsence from corporate social events. If companies want to have a highly-\ncommitted workforce, they need to engage employees right from the start and\nstay the course.\u201d\n\nDoss went on to identify push factors for resignation as low salary, poor\nleadership or toxic company culture, and urged employers to make efforts to\ntrack and understand these reasons, before offering the right solutions to\nretain staff.\n\nJob seekers also tend to feel less guilty for taking a phone interview with a\nrecruiter or an interviewer during working hours, as this is perceived as\nbeing less serious than face-to-face. In the recent Randstad survey, more than\n1 in 3 respondents had taken a call from a recruiter at work (35%) or browsed\nfor jobs on their personal mobile phones (36%) during working hours. 35% had\neven taken time off from work to attend interviews outside of lunch time,\nwhile 21% had attended job interviews during lunch time.\n\nThis trend, however, is beginning to shift, as more employers and candidates\nchoose phone and video interviews as part of preventative measures against the\nCOVID-19 outbreak. Doss explained, \u201cDigital modes of interviews would have a\nhigher weightage and more candidates are beginning to take them more\nseriously. [However], while it is possible to conduct the entire interview via\nphone and video calls, many Asian employers would still want to meet the final\nshortlist face-to-face to determine personality and culture fit before coming\nto a decision.\u201d\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2F60-of-\nsingapore-workers-seek-new-employment-during-working-hours%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=60%25+of+Singapore+workers+seek+new+employment+during+working+hours&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2F60-of-\nsingapore-workers-seek-new-employment-during-working-hours%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrmasia.com%2F60-of-\nsingapore-workers-seek-new-employment-during-working-hours%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-engagement/)** continues to be an elusive metric,\nwith multiple variables contributing to it. Average productivity, retention\nrates, your employer brand, and the quality of customer experiences are all\nindicators of how engaged your workforce truly is. Expectedly, companies often\nstruggle to figure out how to measure employee engagement \u2013 so much so that\nseveral organizations don\u2019t measure it at all.\n\nBut given that engagement is essential to a company's success, it is vital for\nHR to measure it and measure it accurately. We turned to five HR experts to\nfind out what an effective strategy to measure employee engagement in 2020 is.\nBefore we dive into their responses, let\u2019s see how companies approached\nemployee engagement in 2019.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n  * **How Companies Measured Employee Engagement in 2019**\n  * **How to Measure Employee Engagement: According to Experts from Igloo Software, StaffConnect, Globant, Kazoo, and The Predictive Index**\n  * **Why Measuring Employee Engagement Is Essential**\n  * **Key Takeaways to Remember When Measuring Employee Engagement in 2020**\n\n## **How Companies Measured Employee Engagement in 2019**\n\nHR.com and Bonusly conducted a [joint\nsurvey](https://www.hr.com/en/resources/free_research_white_papers/hrcom-\nemployee-engagement-may-2019-research_jwb9ckus.html) of 532 participants from\ncompanies ranging from small businesses to enterprises with 20,000+\nemployees1. The study revealed a few telling insights into the problems faced\nwhen measuring employee engagement:\n\n  * 46% of respondents said that they do not measure employee engagement at all, and only 29% said that they have leaders who prioritize engagement.\n  * Large enterprises fared better, with 72% of organizations with 1,000+ employees measuring engagement levels.\n  * However, companies are holding onto outmoded approaches like once-a-year surveys. 73% of respondents said that they use annual surveys to measure engagement.\n  * Many companies also measure engagement through informal indices such as exit interviews, performance management, and one-on-one conversations with managers.\n  * Nearly one out of five respondents said that they use six to ten measurement methods to evaluate employee engagement.\n\n  \nThe absence of a formalized strategy or platform to measure this valuable\nmetric indicates a need for structure and focus on employee engagement. In\n2020, as engagement becomes a top priority, companies need a smarter and more\nwell-defined approach. Here\u2019s what industry experts say about measuring\nemployee engagement in 2020.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-\nemployee-engagement-ideas/)\n\n## **How to Measure Employee Engagement: According to Experts from Igloo\nSoftware, StaffConnect, Globant, Kazoo, and The Predictive Index**\n\nTraditionally, a once-a-year survey to find out a company\u2019s **[employee Net\nPromoter Score (eNPS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-net-promoter-score-enps-definition-measurement-examples-\nideas/)** was the go-to method for measuring employee engagement. While this\nfigure can reveal a certain level of engagement, it is not entirely accurate\nor enough. As workplaces become more dynamic, engagement levels are open to a\ndegree of flux that cannot be captured in one-year intervals or through just\none form of measurement.\n\nThat\u2019s why some companies are going down the continuous measurement route \u2013\n10% of respondents in the survey mentioned above have already adopted\ncontinuous engagement monitoring and measurement. And when we asked HR experts\nabout the effectiveness of eNPS and how engagement measurement must be\napproached, they echoed a similar view.\n\n### 1\\. Consider activity on your workplace\u2019s social feed, recommends\n**Kristen Ruttgaizer, director of human resources at**[ **Igloo\nSoftware**](https://www.igloosoftware.com/)\n\n  \nA company\u2019s social feed (this could be an intranet, a SaaS platform like\n[Workplace by Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/workplace), or even\ncollaboration tools like [Slack](https://slack.com/)) provides a clear picture\nof how engaged employees are on a daily basis. Leveraging analytics data from\nthese systems can bolster your employee engagement measurement capabilities.\n\n\u201ceNPS is a useful metric in measuring employee engagement, but it can\u2019t stop\nthere. Using the right digital workplace solutions which act as both an\nenabler and measurement tool, a company can pull a number of metrics related\nto employee participation levels,\u201d Ruttgaizer says.\n\n\u201cSo while initiatives like surveys are important, leadership blogs, employee\nnews feeds, recognition (from a kudos center to birthdays), and onboarding\ncenters are excellent in fostering employee engagement and help improve\nretention rates. Then in terms of measurement, participation metrics such as\nlikes, comments, page views, and feedback tells us we\u2019re moving in the right\ndirection,\u201d she adds.\n\nYour workplace\u2019s social feeds may give you evident information, but sentiment\nanalysis tools will give you information from tools like Slack. They simply\nuse natural language processing to understand employee sentiment while\nmaintaining employee anonymity. Do keep in mind that the tools you use to\nmeasure sentiment must abide by the current data privacy laws that protect\nemployee data.\n\n### 2\\. Survey employees twice a year and run pulse surveys in-between,\nsuggests **Ciara O\u2019Keeffe, vice president of customer experience at**[\n**StaffConnect**](https://www.staffconnectapp.com/)\n\n  \nFor companies with a well-established eNPS program, switching to continuous\nmeasurement can be a big leap. A sudden change like this can disrupt your\nworkforce, lowering the participation rate for your surveys. That\u2019s why\nO\u2019Keeffe suggests, it makes more sense first to conduct biannual surveys and\nthen complement them with pulse surveys throughout the year.\n\n\u201ceNPS is a reliable way to measure employee engagement. I advocate multiple\npulse surveys throughout the year to supplement the once or twice-yearly\nsurvey. This approach provides a more accurate measurement of employee\nengagement and can highlight micro trends at key points during the company\u2019s\nyear. Maybe engagement improves after the annual company offsite or worsens\nduring performance review periods,\u201d said O\u2019Keeffe.\n\n### 3\\. Keep an eye on peer-to-peer interactions, advises **Dr. Sanja Licina,\nfuture of organizations practice lead at**[\n**Globant**](https://www.globant.com/)\n\n  \nEmployee behavior \u2013 particularly peer-to-peer interactions \u2013 is a good\nindicator of how your workforce feels about the company. For example, as\nLicina tells us, someone whose productivity levels are high but doesn\u2019t have a\nstrong interpersonal relationship with their colleagues may be considered\ndisengaged.\n\n\u201cAt Globant, we use [StarMeUp OS](https://os.starmeup.com/en/), which enables\nemployees to share recognition, feedback, photos, and ideas in real-time.\nThrough the data and insights collected from the platform, we see that those\nwho are actively interacting with their peers are seven times more likely to\nstay with the company than those who are not interacting with their peers on\nan ongoing basis. Here, we can see the impactful relationship between\nengagement, attrition and business results,\u201d said Licina.\n\nShe also advises on the use of AI to measure and improve employee engagement\nand monitor the state of connectedness in your workplace. AI can highlight the\nimpact of different workplace factors on engagement.\n\nFor example, if you have engaged a leadership coach and engagement witnessed a\nspike soon after, an AI engine will spot the trend.\n\n\u201cWith the help of AI, leaders don\u2019t only have to rely on historical data to\nsee this impact. They can anticipate who is becoming disengaged and have an\nopportunity to be proactive. They can make their employees\u2019 experiences more\npositive to not only retain them but also effectively re-engage them with the\nculture and organization,\u201d Licina mentions.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Top 10 Employee Engagement Apps for\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/top-\nemployee-engagement-apps/)\n\n### 4\\. Roll out a variety of surveys across the year, mentions **Dania\nShaheen, vice president strategy & people operations at\n**[**Kazoo**](https://www.kazoohr.com/)\n\n  \nDifferent survey formats will give you different types of data on employee\nengagement. For instance, eNPS assigns a trackable number, useful for plotting\nyear-on-year engagement trends. Pulse surveys, on the other hand, can reveal\nemployee sentiment around a single facet \u2013 like a newly introduced technology\nor leadership change. That\u2019s why you need them all to track engagement.\n\n\"While eNPS scores are still important because they offer a simple numerical\nmeasurement of employee loyalty and engagement, the best way to measure\nemployee engagement is actually a combination of eNPS, pulse, and custom\nsurveys to get a more complete understanding of where employees stand,\u201d says\nShaheen.\n\n\"A pulse survey asks a set of regular, repeated questions that allow you to\nbenchmark employee sentiment and track improvement. A custom survey asks\nunique questions that get answers to individual situations or needs. Each of\nthese survey types has a different role in helping you dig deeper into the\nimportant data about your engagement programs,\u201d she adds.\n\n### 5\\. Conduct a robust employee census survey, opines **Dr. Greg Barnett,\nsenior vice president, science at**[ **The Predictive\nIndex**](https://www.predictiveindex.com/)\n\n  \nIt is a good idea to retain the annual survey but in a reimagined avatar.\nInstead of condensing the results into a single number through eNPS, you can\nplot detailed charts and graphs based on each response in the survey to arrive\nat actionable measures to improve engagement.\n\n\u201cWhen you really want to understand the state of engagement in your\norganization, the annual employee census survey is still the way to go. Just\nlike your yearly physical, it is a time to fully understand the health of your\ntalent. I\u2019d recommend avoiding simple measures like eNPS and using a robust\ntool that uses a scientific measure of engagement plus items that evaluate the\nemployee experience at the job, team, manager, and broader organization\nlevel,\u201d recommends Barnett.\n\n\u201cUltimately, the measurement isn\u2019t just about the engagement number, but\nreally identifying what is uniquely hurting or helping engagement and taking\naction on it,\u201d he adds.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is an Employee Engagement Survey? Definition, Process,\nVendors, and Examples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-an-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-\nexamples/)**\n\n## **Why Measuring Employee Engagement Is Essential**\n\nThere is an intrinsic link between employee engagement and variables such as\nworkplace behavior, social activity, and\n**[retention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/)**. That\u2019s\nwhy it shouldn\u2019t be measured in isolation \u2013 in 2020, companies need a\nblueprint that combines the variables of employee engagement to get a clear\npicture.\n\n### **1\\. It highlights the impact of factors such as leadership on\nengagement**\n\n  \nO\u2019Keeffe tells us that leadership and management have a significant impact on\nhow engaged employees feel in the workplace. Measuring employee engagement can\nhighlight which driver of engagement has affected it.\n\n\u201cIn Gallup\u2019s 2015 study called _The State of the American Manager,_ 50% of\nAmericans left a job to \u2018get away from their manager at some point in their\ncareer.\u2019 Leadership training, especially for mid-management, has a direct\nimpact on employee engagement,\u201d she shares.\n\nInvesting in managerial coaching programs that focus on soft skills such as\ncommunication and conflict resolution can also make them better leaders and\ncreate a positive impact on overall employee engagement. It would also benefit\norganizations to focus on the manager experience to ensure that they can\ncontribute to employee engagement through their positive **[employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience/)** at work.\n\n### **2\\. It improves company revenue**\n\n  \nBarnett, on the other hand, highlights the link between employee engagement\nand business success. \u201cA recent study revealed that organizations with highly\nengaged employees were 21% more profitable than those with less engaged\nemployees. Engaged teams saw a 10% boost in customer satisfaction ratings and\na 20% increase in sales,\u201d he tells us.\n\nThe Predictive Index recently helped Envision Bank to improve its business\noutcomes by strengthening employee engagement and productivity. Envision Banks\nis a community bank in New England, with six retail outlets and ten lending\ncenters. It leveraged The Predictive Index\u2019s Strategy Assessment and Executing\nStrategy with Confidence workshop, unlocking $1 million in profits within one\nquarter (Q2 of 2019).\n\nExamples like this illustrate why measuring employee engagement is so integral\nfor businesses looking to drive growth and reach new levels of success.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **20 Essential Employee Engagement Survey Questions for Your\n2020 Questionnaire**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-engagement-survey-questions/)\n\n## **Key Takeaways to Remember When Measuring Employee Engagement in 2020**\n\nThe writing is on the wall: while annual surveys continue to be relevant,\ncompanies are moving towards a more regular feedback schedule, which always\nlets them keep a finger on the employee pulse. Once you are clear on how to\nmeasure employee engagement, you can start working towards improving it. There\nare many ways to achieve this \u2013 from simple measures such as coaching and\nincentives to more elaborate steps such as leveraging performance management\nsoftware to boost employee engagement.\n\nOver one-third of respondents in the HR.com survey, we mentioned measure\nemployee engagement more than once a year \u2013 and this trend will gain further\nmomentum in 2020. That\u2019s why you need to:\n\n  * Design multiple surveys to measure specific goals\n  * Use a survey tool to streamline data collection and analysis\n  * Collaborate with department/division-level stakeholders when reviewing survey results\n  * Look for action points in the data, not merely an all-encompassing score\n\n  \nEngagement cannot be limited to one-off initiatives or events. It must be\nwoven into every element of HR, from learning and development (L&D;) to\ninternal communications, and\n**[recruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-recruitment/)**. When making decisions about a new project,\nask yourself which outcome would be best for the employee. This is integral to\nenable engagement at a holistic level.\n\n\u201cEmployee engagement starts by prioritizing the employees themselves. It\u2019s\nsimple: when companies put their people front-and-center, employees will be\nmore engaged and perform at a higher level for your organization. By putting\npeople first and giving them the space to grow and connect with others in\ntheir workplace, businesses will see positive impacts on key performance\nindicators,\u201d says Shaheen.\n\nThese tips, along with the insights shared by the five HR luminaries, will\nkeep companies on the right track as they explore how to measure employee\nengagement in 2020. And once you have an accurate picture in place, you can\nwork on the different factors that influence (and are influenced by)\nengagement, bringing about a holistic transformation in your workplace.\n\n_What is your recommended method for measuring employee engagement?

heart of new survey products that provide\ncontinual data.\n\nBy: [Larry Stevens](https://hrexecutive.com/author/larry-stevens/ \"Posts by\nLarry Stevens\") | July 24, 2019 \u2022 9 min read\n\nTopics:\n[Engagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/engagement/) |\n[HR Technology](https://hrexecutive.com/category/hrtechnology/) | [Talent\nManagement](https://hrexecutive.com/category/talentmanagement/) | [Top\nStories](https://hrexecutive.com/category/top-stories/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Survey-700x467.jpg)\n\nLike many companies, Nasdaq had been conducting annual surveys among all its\nworkers to gauge employee satisfaction: Were they happy with how they were\nbeing compensated? Were they getting the training they needed and the\nrecognition they desired? Did they see themselves remaining at Nasdaq?\n\nThe results rendered a good picture of how well the company was engaging its\nworkforce. But there was a big shortcoming with this method, according to Rich\nTaylor, vice president of employee experience at the company. \u201cThe data we got\nfrom the surveys weren\u2019t actionable,\u201d he says. Because the survey didn\u2019t\npinpoint specific problem areas\u2014teams, managers or departments, for\ninstance\u2014there was no way to help underperformers improve.\n\nNasdaq solved that problem using Culture Amp, a real-time survey product it\nlaunched at the start of this year that, Taylor says, makes it easy to conduct\nsurveys and interpret results. Without much effort, the company was able to\nincrease the number of surveys to four a year. Equally important, the data are\nmore granular\u2014indicating results to line managers. \u201cNow, we can gauge employee\nengagement down to teams with as few as four people,\u201d Taylor says. He adds\nthat he can actually get even more specific than four people, but that would\nthreaten anonymity, which is essential to getting honest responses, according\nto all experts interviewed for this article.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nCulture Amp is one of a number of [real-time survey\ntools](http://hrexecutive.com/whats-new-in-employee-engagement/), which\ninclude Glint, UltiPro Perception, TinyPULSE and Deloitte EngagePath. These\nproducts facilitate the creation of survey questions; provide for survey\ncross-platform distribution; and, most importantly, create real-time graphical\nrepresentation of the data using dashboards, heat maps, alerts, graphs and\nmore.\n\nThe creation of the survey questions, facilitated by support from the vendor,\nTaylor says, adds an important dimension to the process. He can select\nquestions from those provided by the software, which allows him to benchmark\nthe company relative to other Culture Amp customers, and he can also get help\nin phrasing his own questions. For example, he discovered through this process\nthat a question he intended to include could provide more meaningful results\nif asked as two separate questions.\n\nArmen Berjikly, senior director of growth strategy for Ultimate Software,\nwhich makes UltiPro Perception, agrees that the wording of survey questions\ncan be key to getting accurate results.\n\n\u201cPeople speak of things in different ways,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes, that\u2019s a\nfunction of their position in the company, sometimes their experience.\u201d An\nentire survey, Berjikly says, can fail to provide accurate results because of\na few misplaced words or sentences.\n\nDistribution of the surveys is virtually automatic, and employees can access\nthem on any device. Taylor says he keeps surveys short enough so that\nparticipants can complete them in less than three minutes. \u201cIf the surveys are\ntoo long, employees get tired and don\u2019t consider the responses carefully,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n[Josh Bersin](http://hrexecutive.com/author/josh-bersin/), global industry\nanalyst, agrees that the standard annual surveys take too long to administer\nand for results to be compiled\u2014and they rarely provide the information a\ncompany needs to solve its problems with employee engagement. Accordingly,\nmany companies turned to outside consultants to administer the surveys and\nanalyze the results.\n\n\u201cIt could take months before companies got meaningful, usable data, if they\ngot them at all,\u201d Bersin says. The new breed of products that provide both\nsurveys and graphical interpretations are less expensive than hiring\nconsultants, easier to use and provide immediate, actionable data. \u201cCompanies\nthat need to gauge employee engagement should at least familiarize themselves\nwith the capability of these tools,\u201d Bersin says.\n\n**Getting Managers on Board**\n\nFor the implementation of a new survey solution to be successful, managers\nhave to support it. Taylor acknowledges that, at first, some were worried that\nthe tool might show faults with their management process. Once the rollout\nbegan, however, their worry turned to curiosity; they wanted to know how well\nthey were doing. \u201cBefore, managers had no way of really knowing what was in\nthe minds of employees they worked with,\u201d he says.\n\nIn general, managers were pleasantly surprised at how engaged their teams\nwere. Still, most managers found areas to work on. So, Taylor and other\nmembers of his department asked them to develop action plans to shore up areas\nof concern. \u201cWe asked them to prioritize one or two things that they would\nwork on and hopefully improve before the next quarterly survey,\u201d Taylor says.\n\nFor example, if managers receive low scores from their teams on a question\nlike, \u201cI see good career opportunities at Nasdaq,\u201d they may hold regular one-\non-one meetings with employees to discuss career paths at the company.\nManagers who are at a loss to determine how to fix a problem can also turn to\nthe tool, which provides some suggestions. More importantly, managers can seek\nhelp from the company\u2019s employee experience department, whose members have\nexpertise in solving employee-engagement challenges.\n\nAt Nasdaq, the primary purpose of the surveys is to _help_ managers, not as a\ntool for _evaluating_ managers\u2019 performance. However, Taylor says, he would be\nhesitant to recommend someone for promotion who consistently gets poor grades\nfrom those he or she supervises. He\u2019s also had to have a few difficult talks\nwith managers whose teams struggled with engagement, asking if they think they\nare in the right position. \u201cI suspect, as we move on and have more surveys\nunder our belt, we will be having more of those types of conversations,\u201d he\nsays.\n\n**Inclusivity is Key**\n\nOther companies use survey tools to help managers help themselves.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even see the results from individual managers,\u201d says Joan Burke,\nchief people officer at DocuSign, which has implemented survey product Glint.\n\u201cExecutives only see the roll-up results from all managers.\u201d\n\nDocuSign gave all managers the ability to see their teams\u2019 survey responses, a\npractice Burke believes is essential to taking full advantage of survey\nresults. When her previous company implemented Glint, she was a bit nervous\nabout potential problems with the company-wide rollout of a brand-new product,\nso, at that company, she provided survey results only to people at the\nexecutive level. They reported the results were much easier to analyze than\ntraditional row-and-column survey data, but they didn\u2019t always know how they\ncould actually use the data to effect change.\n\nBurke\u2019s experience with Glint at her former employer showed her that \u201cThe\nsurvey data were very interesting at a corporate level\u2014and there are things\nyou can do at that level\u2014but they\u2019re limited,\u201d she says. Only when the company\nbegan including employees at the line-management level did it begin to see\nsignificant improvement in engagement, as measured by Glint.\n\nSo when she implemented Glint at DocuSign, she says, \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to make\nthat mistake again.\u201d The company rolled out access to the software to all\nmanagers. She says the intuitiveness of the tool virtually eliminated the need\nfor training, other than a brief introductory video. \u201cGenerally, I just tell\npeople, \u2018Experiment with the dashboard. You can\u2019t break it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGlint provides alarms to indicate areas that need work, but the specific\nactions managers take are up to them. For example, Burke found she was weak in\nthe area of employee recognition, so she convened focus groups to hear\nspecifically what workers felt was missing.\n\nThe tool itself can provide some suggestions, as can HR. At DocuSign, because\nof company expansion, a large number of people were moved into management,\ncreating a population of managers with less than two years of experience.\nAccordingly, the company recently initiated a six-month manager-training\nprogram, which, Burke says, can include a focus on areas indicated as weak by\nthe Glint tool.\n\n**ROI Implications**\n\nAs with most [technology rollouts](http://hrexecutive.com/how-to-give-\nemployees-the-experience-they-want-2/), executive support is essential to\nsuccess\u2014which often hinges on demonstrable ROI.\n\nBurke says the tool, in a sense, is self-justifying. \u201cThe traditional answer\nwhen HR is asked to justify the cost of a product is to say that, without the\nprogram, we would be in worse shape. But with the tool, we can actually\nmeasure the benefit of it by comparing rolled-up data quarter to quarter,\u201d she\nsays.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nThese tools can also be applied when seeking to measure effectiveness and\nimprove specific corporate programs. For example, Andrew Bohacek, talent\nsuccess manager at Duluth Trading Co., says his company uses UltiPro\nPerception to, among other things, fine-tune its 45-day onboarding process.\n\n\u201cPreviously, we used products like SurveyMonkey, and that gave us a general\nidea of whether we were doing a good job of onboarding,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\ndidn\u2019t give us the granularity we needed to improve the onboarding program.\u201d\n\nFor example, if a training program was rated poorly, was it the medium in\nwhich it was presented? Was it the length? Was it too boring or too wordy? Was\nit sufficient? Was it too time-consuming? Says Bohacek, \u201cIt\u2019s great to hear\nthat employees found HR was helpful\u2014but what specifically did the employee\nlike or dislike, and why? [These] were questions generalized surveys didn\u2019t\nalways answer.\u201d\n\nNow using real-time data from UltiPro Perception, \u201cWe were able to completely\nrevamp the onboarding program,\u201d he says. And while the company had been\nconsidering changes to the program even before getting the new tool, the\nsurveys provided a roadmap. \u201cWe were no longer just trying things to see if\nthey worked, with no data to actually determine scientifically if they were.\u201d\n\nDuluth uses Perception to understand how employees are engaged after they\ncomplete the onboarding process as well. This is especially important since\nmany of its workers do not sit in traditional offices, where there is regular\ninteraction among managers and those who work for them. \u201cMany of our employees\nwork in a distribution center where they\u2019re pulling product and shipping, not\nhaving one-on-one talks with their supervisors,\u201d Bohacek says. In addition,\nmany people in the customer-support area work from home.\n\nIn order to survey workers, Duluth passes around an iPad and also has kiosks\naround the distribution centers. The survey takes only a few minutes to\ncomplete. The fact that the workers don\u2019t identify themselves on the mobile\ndevices\u2014and, in fact, are not even using their own devices\u2014gives them the\nreassurance many need that their responses are private. Once the survey is\ncompleted, heat maps show managers areas that the company needs to pay more\nattention to, such as compensation, recognition or training. Or if problems\nshow up in specific departments, there might be a need for leadership training\nof supervisors.\n\nThe ability for HR to gauge employee engagement continually, rather than once\na year, is key in today\u2019s market, says JD Peterson, Culture Amp\u2019s chief growth\nofficer.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s fast-moving business environment, there is a lot of change,\u201d he\nsays, noting mergers and acquisitions, expansions, contractions, promotions,\nnew hires and exits all may affect employee engagement. \u201cWe need to be able to\nmeasure that effect continually, not just once a year.\u201d\n\n\n\nLarry Stevens is a freelance writer based in Monson, Mass., who covers trends\nand developments in human resources and technology.

and\nMetrics](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/content_images/employee_engagement_vs_job_satisfaction_key_differences_and_metrics_5e1337da4fa8f.jpg)\n\n**_Employee engagement and job satisfaction both deserve equal attention if\nyou are to maximize your workforce\u2019s potential and enable the growth of your\norganization. Read our primer to know about the difference between employee\nengagement and job satisfaction, as well as how they are intrinsically\nrelated._**\n\nDid you know that a staggering 41.4 million people in the U.S. left their jobs\nvoluntarily in 2018? This is 8.3% more than the previous year and 88% more\nthan at the start of this decade, according to the [2019 Retention Report by\nWork Institute](http://info.workinstitute.com/retentionreport2019).\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834cadce393.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nThis rate of voluntary turnover costs companies billions in lost productivity,\nrehiring, and retraining expenses every year.\n\nOne way to retain at least some number of employees is by addressing the\nissues of employee engagement and job satisfaction. The two are different, and\nlearning how they differ can help you keep your employees happy, motivated,\nand less likely to quit.\n\nAnd this has a massive impact: even a 10% reduction in voluntary turnover can\nsave U.S. companies $475 billion, says the Work Institute report mentioned\nabove.\n\nSo, how do employee engagement and **[job\nsatisfaction](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/job-\nsatisfaction-definition-factors-importance-statistics-examples/)** differ? Is\nyour assessment of these two metrics accurate? Let\u2019s find out.\n\n## **Table of Contents**\n\n  * **Employee Engagement and Job Satisfaction: Are They the Same?**\n  * **Factors Affecting Job Satisfaction**\n  * **Factors Affecting Employee Engagement**\n  * **How Do Employee Engagement Metrics Differ From Job Satisfaction Metrics?**\n  * **Employee Engagement and Job Satisfaction on Maslow\u2019s Pyramid**\n  * **Key Takeaways**\n\n##  \n**Employee Engagement and Job Satisfaction: Are They the Same?**\n\nTo identify the difference between these two areas, let\u2019s consider two types\nof employees.\n\nImagine a manufacturing employee, Nathan, who starts his shift at 9 AM every\nday and works until 5 PM with a one-hour lunch break in-between. He receives a\ncompetitive pay package, better than other manufacturing plants located in his\ncounty. It takes Nathan only 20 minutes to reach the plant, and he has been\nworking there for the last seven years. In this period, he has been promoted\ntwice. He also receives full medical coverage for himself and his family,\nwhich makes him worry less about the future.\n\nThese indicators suggest that Nathan is satisfied with his job. The job\nprovides everything he needs, and he has no complaints from it.\n\nNow consider Amanda, a software developer at a startup. The company is in the\nearly stages of growth, and Amanda has been offered equity benefits instead of\nstandard compensation elements until the first round of funding comes in.\nAmanda often spends over 10 hours in the office, trying to meet deadlines and\ngetting the product off the ground. She is passionate about her work and is\ncontinually learning new things in her domain, which makes her a highly\nskilled professional.\n\nAmanda\u2019s passion for her job and her desire to learn more about her work are\nindicators that she is highly engaged in her job, even though some of the\ntraditional satisfaction components are missing.\n\nWhat is important to note here, however, is that job satisfaction and employee\nengagement are both equally important. While satisfaction may be enough to\nsustain an employee in a job for seven years, it is engagement in the job that\nwill help employees reach their full potential and subsequently enable the\ngrowth of the organization. Only when your workforce is satisfied and engaged,\nyou can sustain productivity levels in the long run.\n\n### **Job Satisfaction**\n\n  \nJob satisfaction can be defined as the sense of contentment one feels as a\ndirect result of being employed in a particular role. It isn\u2019t only when the\nemployee is content while in the office/workplace \u2014 their job makes them feel\ncontent in life, impacting areas such as security and confidence. Job\nsatisfaction is a must-have if you want your employees to have a long tenure\nwith your company.\n\nConsidering Amanda\u2019s example above, she may be engaged. Still, unless the\ncompany receives funding and starts providing her with the pay commensurate\nwith her efforts, she is likely to start looking for a new job because the\nsatisfaction element may be missing.\n\n### **Employee Engagement**\n\n  \n**[Employee engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-engagement/)** can be defined as the level of\ninvolvement and connection one feels in their job. Various forces shape\nengagement, including the nature of leadership and the sense of community in\nthe workplace. There\u2019s also an individual factor in employee engagement \u2013 if\nyou placed Nathan in Amanda\u2019s role, he might not have experienced the same\nlevel of engagement. Motivation, interest, passion, purpose, and personal\ninvestment all make up how engaged an employee is.\n\nEngagement is what ensures that employees are part of a company\u2019s growth\ncurve. For example, if Nathan isn\u2019t engaged in his role at the manufacturing\nplant, he will feel there is no direct link between his job and the company\u2019s\nsuccess. Over time, this feeling could intensify, causing him to look for a\nmore meaningful employment option.\n\nThis is where you should note that engagement is also associated with\nemployees' personality type. Nathan's seven years at the job can be an\nindicator that for him, the security that comes with a job and the ensuing\nsatisfaction is a higher priority than being engaged on the job at the cost of\nweaker job security.\n\nSo, there\u2019s a subtle but definite difference between employee engagement and\njob satisfaction. Let\u2019s look at the top factors influencing these parameters.\n\n## **Factors Affecting Job Satisfaction**\n\nTypically, it is the monetary and associated factors that determine how\n_satisfied_ employees are with their job. The top four elements include:\n\n### **1\\. Compensation**\n\n  \nThe first (and probably the biggest) driver of job satisfaction is\ncompensation. Remember two things here. One, the pay scale must be positioned\ncompetitively against similar companies in your region. Two, employees should\nbe able to maintain an above-average quality of life with the compensation\nprovided.\n\n### **2\\. Benefits**\n\n  \nSupporting the advantages of good pay, you can offer a comprehensive benefits\npackage that takes care of physical and mental well-being, financial wellness,\nchildcare, and family coverage. You may not need innovative perks like\nunlimited paid time off or an in-house gym. And this is a key difference\nbetween employee engagement and job satisfaction. People want stronger basics\nthan perks they can do without.\n\n### **3\\. Work-life balance**\n\n  \n62% of workers feel the work-life balance is most important for a company\nculture that fosters success.\n\nShorter commutes, the freedom to work from home, paid leaves, and mandatory\nvacation days, among other things, can ensure a positive work-life balance for\nyour workforce. They will have more time to spend with family or in personal\npursuits, thereby improving the quality of life. This is one of those factors\nthat not only ensures satisfaction but can also contribute to a certain level\nof employee engagement.\n\n### **4\\. Recognition**\n\n  \nEvery employee, no matter their personality, professional goals, or level of\nengagement/satisfaction, wants to be appreciated for their contribution. You\ncan adopt a formal structure of recognition, with annual reviews and\nappraisals, or an informal one, where achievements are acknowledged in the\nmoment. We recommend both. Note, again, that this is a factor that can enable\nboth satisfaction and engagement at work.\n\n## **Factors Affecting Employee Engagement**\n\nThe drivers of _employee engagement_ are slightly different. You\u2019ll notice\nthat they are focused more on employee development and future needs. Here are\nthe top four factors for this parameter.:\n\n### **1\\. Inspiring leadership**\n\n  \nEmployee engagement starts at the top. Company leaders must be collaborative,\nregularly interacting with their workforce, sharing ideas with them, and\nsoliciting their contributions before making a significant decision. This\nmakes employees feel like they are involved in the company's growth and keeps\nthem engaged.\n\n### **2\\. Career development**\n\n  \nIn many ways, career development can be better than employee benefits, and\nthis applies particularly to millennials/Gen Zers. [LinkedIn\u2019s 2019 Workforce\nLearning Report](https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-\nreport) found that the No. 1 reason this segment quits is the lack of learning\nand career development opportunities.\n\n### **3\\. Internal communication**\n\n  \nCommunication plays a significant role in how engaged your employees are,\nespecially if you have a large distributed workforce. The ability to connect\nin real-time, receive regular updates from the company, and quickly resolve\nissues (no matter how trivial) is critical to enabling an engagement-friendly\nworkplace.\n\n### **4\\. A culture of diversity**\n\n  \nTo ensure maximum engagement for all individuals, diverse work culture is\nessential. This means that the company is open to new ideas from every\nemployee, proactively prevents bias, and ensures equal opportunity for all.\nDiversity must be embedded within the company values, covering every minority\ngroup as well as the generational divide.\n\n**Learn More:** **[20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-\nemployee-engagement-ideas/)**\n\n## **How Do Employee Engagement Metrics Differ From Job Satisfaction\nMetrics?**\n\nTo demonstrate the difference between employee engagement and job\nsatisfaction, let\u2019s look at the findings of a 2017 survey by the Society for\nHuman Resource Management (SHRM).\n\n[SHRM\u2019s 2017 Employee Job Satisfaction and Engagement\nReport](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-\nsurveys/pages/2017-job-satisfaction-and-engagement-doors-of-opportunity-are-\nopen.aspx) found that employees are now more satisfied with work than ever\nbefore. Companies are treating their workers with respect, compensation is\nmostly attractive, and job security is now almost commonplace. In contrast,\nthe report said that engagement levels were only \"moderate,\" and there was\n\"room for organizations to improve employee engagement.\"\n\nTake a look at these job satisfaction findings in the report:\n\n  * Over half of the U.S. employees surveyed said they were satisfied with their jobs; another 38% said they were very satisfied.\n  * The top three contributors to job satisfaction were respectful treatment, total compensation, and the trust between employees and senior management.\n  * 58% of employees mentioned that job security was \u201cvery important,\u201d but only 36% were happy with the current state of job security. This is consistent across genders, generations, and job levels.\n\n  \nNow take a look at these findings on employee engagement in the report:\n\n  * The U.S. workforce, as represented by survey respondents, indicates that they are moderately engaged, with an index of 3.9 out of 5. \n  * This is a marginal improvement over previous years \u2013 employee engagement stood at 3.7 in 2014 and 3.8 in 2015.\n  * Employees are more engaged with their work on an individual level, reporting a 4.0 out of 5 engagement indices in this parameter. In contrast, they rate their colleagues' engagement with the job at a far lower 3.7 out of 5.\n\n  \nAs you can see from these metrics, it is essential to measure both\nsatisfaction and engagement separately and carefully to arrive at an accurate\npicture of organizational health. Let\u2019s look at how you can effectively\nmeasure them.\n\n### **Measure these metrics to assess job satisfaction**\n\n  \nTo pinpoint the exact level of job satisfaction among your workforce, look at\nthe more tangible aspects of your company. For example, compensation,\nbenefits, and workplace amenities are factors that require careful evaluation.\nMeasure the following three metrics to get a clear picture of job\nsatisfaction:\n\n**1\\. Absenteeism and unpaid leaves**\n\nAbsenteeism is a clear sign that employees aren\u2019t motivated enough to turn up\nfor work as per schedule. This doesn\u2019t include paid leaves \u2013 after all, if\nemployees choose to use their paid leaves to explore their personal\ngoals/targets, it suggests a positive work-life balance. But if employees are\nwilling to forego part of their compensation for unpaid leave, you may need to\nrevisit your job satisfaction measures.\n\n**2\\. Referral volumes**\n\nSomeone satisfied with their job is likely to recommend others to join as\nwell. They would like their friends and family to enjoy the same benefits that\nthey receive in your company. However, a dip in referrals could indicate\nemployees aren\u2019t satisfied.\n\nThey might still be engaged \u2013 in other words, they value their work but feel\nthat workplace benefits aren't adequate to compensate for their efforts.\nThat's why this metric needs careful observation.\n\n**3\\. Social media reviews**\n\nEmployee reviews on social networks like Glassdoor or Indeed can reveal\nvaluable data on job satisfaction. Often, the information they might not share\ndirectly with their employer is expressed via social media. Turn reviews into\naction points and monitor the impact on your job satisfaction scores.\n\n### **Measure these metrics to gauge employee engagement**\n\n  \nEmployee engagement has a broader purview than satisfaction. This is why the\nmetrics for measurement are slightly more complex \u2013 they capture a variety of\nvariables. Track the following three parameters to ascertain how engaged\nemployees are at your company:\n\n**1\\. Employee net promoter score (eNPS)**\n\neNPS indicates an employee\u2019s willingness to recommend others (note that the\nactual volume of referrals isn\u2019t part of eNPS calculations). Employees assign\nyour company a score of 0 to 10, depending on which they are categorized as\npromoters, detractors, or passives. A large number of promoters than\ndetractors is a good sign of engagement. Read more about this on our detailed\nguide to eNPS.\n\n**2\\. Offer acceptance rates**\n\nOffer acceptance rates reflect the candidate engagement factor at your\ncompany. Let\u2019s say a company is scheduled to onboard 10 recruits in a month \u2013\nbut only five of them turn up. There is a clear gap in engaging these\ncandidates. This could be a reflection of the overall engagement at your\ncompany \u2013 if the engagement efforts cannot bring in candidates, they may be\nless successful in retaining current employees.\n\n**3\\. Total health index (THI)**\n\nThis is a relatively new concept that aims to capture three traits of employee\nengagement. First, it measures attendance, a basic criterion that shows\ninterest. Second, it factors in unhealthy presenteeism: when employees turn up\nto work despite feeling unwell or facing other pressures. Finally, it\nevaluates willingness for discretionary effort, where employees are resilient\nenough to go the extra mile for the company. Providing a picture of overall\nengagement, this metric helps organizations streamline efforts in multiple\nareas to ensure total engagement during the employee lifecycle.\n\n## **Employee Engagement and Job Satisfaction on Maslow\u2019s Pyramid**\n\nOne way to understand the difference between employee engagement and job\nsatisfaction \u2013 as well as how the two are related \u2013 is by placing them on\nMaslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs pyramid.\n\nMaslow\u2019s pyramid is widely applied to study the different factors influencing\nworkplace engagement. Interestingly, if you look at the bottom three layers,\nthey deal primarily with job satisfaction drivers. As you progress up the\npyramid, factors contributing to employee engagement come into play. The\npyramid also suggests that job satisfaction and employee engagement belong on\nthe same spectrum, and you cannot have one without the other.\n\n![. Job satisfaction and employee engagement represented on Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy\nof Needs](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. Job satisfaction and employee engagement represented on Maslow\u2019s\nHierarchy of Needs**\n\nJob satisfaction is the foundation without which employee engagement cannot be\nsustained. And employee engagement differentiates the job role from the many\nothers available to the professional. It gives the work meaning and a sense of\npurpose, enabling pride and self-development \u2013 factors necessary to achieve\none\u2019s full potential.\n\nSo, the progress would look like this: companies begin by regularly measuring\njob satisfaction among employees. They implement the necessary measures to\nimprove satisfaction. They then follow them up with **[employee engagement\nsurveys](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nan-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-examples/)** ,\nunderstanding the areas where the company isn\u2019t performing so well.\nAccordingly, engagement initiatives can be deployed \u2013 this could include\ncareer pathing programs, out-of-the-box perks, personalized learning,\ncustomized rewards, and so on.\n\nGoing back to our original example, imagine if Amanda's company had to wait\nfor over two years before launching their product. On the surface, it may seem\nthat Amanda is extraordinarily engaged and invested in the company's future.\nBut biannual surveys could reveal that she is not experiencing any\nsatisfaction in her job, making her a prime candidate for voluntary\n**[attrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-attrition-complete-guide/)**.\n\nFor outcome-focused companies, there's always a risk of prioritizing\nengagement over satisfaction. And the reverse might be true in process-based\nverticals. That's why it is so important to use a framework like Maslow's\nhierarchy of needs to understand precisely where you are on the spectrum. To\nbecome an employer of choice, start at the bottom and offer support to your\nemployees as they make their way to the top of the pyramid.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **15 Essential Employee Satisfaction Survey Questions for\nYour 2020 Questionnaire**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-satisfaction-survey-questions/)\n\n## **Key Takeaways**\n\nEmployee engagement and job satisfaction might be different, but they both\nplay a vital role for companies looking to improve **[employee\nretention](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-retention-definition-strategy-examples/)** and maximize\nproductivity. That\u2019s why you should keep the following points of difference in\nmind:\n\n**Job satisfaction**\n\n|\n\n**Employee engagement**  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nIt is the sense of contentment in life that one experiences as a direct result\nof being employed at their current job.\n\n|\n\nIt is the level of interest and connectedness one feels with the work\nenvironment and the company during everyday professional interactions.  \n  \nCompensation, benefits, work-life balance, and recognition \u2013 the traditional\ncomponents of a total rewards package \u2013 drive job satisfaction.\n\n|\n\nLeadership, career development, communication, and diversity \u2013 the components\nof the employee value proposition[\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-\nemployee-value-proposition-and-how-to-create-a-successful-evp-model/)\u2013 drive\nengagement.  \n  \nAs per Maslow\u2019s pyramid, job satisfaction is a basic necessity for any\nemployee.\n\n|\n\nEmployee engagement should be something that every organization aspires to,\nculminating in self-fulfillment for employees.  \n  \nBy regularly measuring both facets, you can ensure that your company is on the\nright track. It will help to reduce voluntary attrition, strengthen your\nemployer brand, and accelerate growth, unhindered by workforce-related\nroadblocks.\n\n_What is your assessment of the difference between employee engagement and job\nsatisfaction?

Auckland Sport & Recreation Survey Identifies Much-needed COVID-19 Support\n\n**Tuesday, 7 April 2020, 5:38 pm**  \n**Press Release:[Aktive - Auckland Sport and\nRecreation](https://info.scoop.co.nz/Aktive_-_Auckland_Sport_and_Recreation)**\n\nLockdown uncertainty, loss of membership, human resources, solvency and\nrecovery plans are among key aspects keeping Auckland sport and recreation\norganisations awake at night as the country faces COVID-19.\n\nInitiated by Aktive, the survey was conducted in late March and received 168\nresponses, providing valuable statistically valid insights into understand the\npandemic\u2019s current and potential impact on the sector. With the majority (94%)\nof respondents cancelling events or programmes, and around one quarter (23%)\nindicating cashflow and resources to support operations will last one to four\nweeks, the survey identified immediate areas of concern.\n\nDr Sarah Sandley, CE, Aktive says the noted aspects, along with communications\nand legal guidance, are addressed in a comprehensive plan that is already\nbeing implemented.\n\n\"Along with our partners, we want to ensure that all clubs, codes and\norganisations are as equipped as best possible to respond to the impact of\nCOVID-19,\" says Dr Sandley. \"This survey has provided valuable insights and we\nare focusing capabilities and resources to provide fast and effective\ndeployment of targeted support.\n\n\"We are also facilitating online networking opportunities so people in the\nsector can share ideas and solutions. We know it\u2019s a tough time for many\npeople and this engagement is important for both the sector and personal\nwellbeing.\"\n\nNearly three quarters (72%) of the 168 survey respondents indicated they have\naccess to technology and facilities to work remotely, supporting such\nengagement. Around two thirds (66%) of the 168 survey respondents were sports\nclubs, and the same number employ full or part-time staff; of these just over\nhalf (53%) have applied for the Government Wage Subsidy Scheme with a further\n22% intending to apply.\n\nIn response to survey results, Aktive has convened the Auckland Sport &\nRecreation Taskforce, including Sport New Zealand, Auckland Council and\npartners CLM Community Sport, Harbour Sport, Sport Auckland and Sport\nWait\u0101kere.\n\nAktive has also developed a six-point action plan to support the sector. All\nfree of charge, it comprises legal support via Aktive\u2019s partner Simpson\nGrierson; surveys to help organisations understand members and their needs at\nthis time; Thinking Differently member engagement and retention forum for\norganised sport; HR including resources and webinars; weekly What\u2019s on Your\nMind chat room facilitating online connections; and accounting services\nthrough Aktive\u2019s Shared Services.\n\nWeekly Sector Resilience Meetings led by Aktive and including the latest\ninformation from Sport New Zealand, Auckland Council, the Gaming Machine\nAssociation of New Zealand and others are proving valuable support information\nand advice for the sector, with more than 190 attending yesterday\u2019s virtual\nmeeting. In addition, tailored webinars, forums and chat rooms are being\ndelivered online with information available\n<https://aktive.org.nz/covid-19-updates/sector-support/>\n\n\"These discussions offer opportunities to work through the sector\u2019s immediate\nconcerns such as how to retain members, and the maintenance of grounds and\nplaying turfs ,\" says Dr Sandley. \"The maintenance issue is creating angst for\naffected codes, and in response we are coordinating a session with Auckland\nCouncil and all field code Regional Sport Organisations to discuss turf\nopportunities, chaired by Sport Auckland Chief Executive Mike Elliott.\n\n\"COVID-19 is having widespread implications across every part of our daily\ninteractions, including recreational and sport-related activities. With our\npartners, we are committed to supporting the sector however possible - we\u2019re\nin this for the long term and here to help.\"\n\nFor more information visit [www.aktive.org.nz](http://www.aktive.org.nz/)\n\n[(C) Scoop Media](http://www.scoop.co.nz/about/terms.html)  \n\n#### Join the Scoop Citizen Community\n\n20 years of independent publishing is a milestone, but your support is\nessential to keep Scoop thriving.

With a little luck, 2020 could be the start\nof an Employee Experience Renaissance.\n\nBut what has to change for culture-first to be realized? What are the\nexpectations of today\u2019s workforce compared to the reality of what\norganizations are actually delivering?\n\nEmplify\u2019s [2020 Employee Engagement\nTrends](https://emplify.com/resource/2020-employee-engagement-trends-report/\n\"https://emplify.com/resource/2020-employee-engagement-trends-report/\")\nreport, sought to reveal the perceptions, attitudes, and opinions about work\nfrom a survey of more than 1,000 U.S. employees. The research uncovered five\ndisconnects that have to be resolved in the coming decade.\n\n**Disconnect 1: Employees burnout is common**\n\nEmplify\u2019s survey revealed that more than half of respondents are burned out at\nwork. Of those employees, one-third endure burnout weekly; 20% daily. The\nWorld Health Organization defines\n[burnout](https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/burn-out/en/\n\"https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/burn-out/en/\") as \u201cchronic\nworkplace stress that has not been successfully managed.\u201d Along with energy\ndepletion, increased negative feelings towards one\u2019s career, and reduced\nproductivity, burnout can affect an employee\u2019s physical health in ways that\nfree snacks and gym memberships can\u2019t reverse.\n\nAccording to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-\nlifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/burnout/art-20046642\n\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-\ndepth/burnout/art-20046642\") and others, contributing factors to burnout\ninclude:\n\n  * **Lack of autonomy -** when an employee has little control over decisions that affect his or her work, be it assignments or workload\n  * **Lack of role clarity -** when job expectations are unclear, or an employee is unsure of how their manager is measuring performance\n  * **Not enough rest -** when employees don\u2019t get enough time away from work to recharge\n\n**Disconnect 2: HR\u2019s must shift from administrative to strategic**\n\nAs the expectations of today\u2019s workforce rise and the pool of qualified job\ncandidates shrinks, the human resources function must undergo a fundamental\nshift. Once a role relegated to paperwork, processes, and programs, savvy HR\nleaders are moving toward strategic \u201cpeople operations,\u201d putting the right\npeople in the right place at the right time to move the business forward. This\nmeans that HR must have a seat at the table for planning and budgeting\nconversations to align people strategy with long-term business goals.\n\nIn practice, strategic HR requires planning ahead for the roles and skills\nneeded to support future growth. But there\u2019s more to it than figuring out who\nto hire and when. It also means knowing when to upskill or reskill an existing\nemployee. This will require HR to cultivate deeper relationships with\nemployees to better understand how their skills and talents compare to what\nthe organization needs. Employees\u2019 perceptions of HR leaders will shift\naccordingly. They will see HR leaders as proponents of professional\ndevelopment, rather than pushers of paperwork.\n\n**Disconnect 3: Command-and-control instead of a \u201ccoach approach\u201d**\n\nToday, many managers still cling to an industrial-era concept of command-and-\ncontrol leadership. If the 20s are to be a culture-first decade, organizations\nneed to embrace more of a \u201ccoach approach\u201d to leadership. Unfortunately, there\nis a long way to go.\n\nEmplify\u2019s survey found that one-third of respondents meet one-on-one with\ntheir manager once per month or less, and one in 10 almost never meet one-on-\none with their manager. Scheduling standing one-on-ones with direct reports is\none of the most powerful ways to strengthen relationships with direct reports.\nBut these meetings must consistently be a top priority on the manager\u2019s\ncalendar, which means refraining from frequent rescheduling or canceling. As\nthe report states, \u201cnothing sends a louder message to employees that their\nneeds aren\u2019t valued than constantly getting shuffled around on their manager\u2019s\ncalendar.\u201d\n\n**Disconnect 4: Current employees aren\u2019t utilized as brand ambassadors**\n\nDespite the unemployment rate hovering at record lows, there\u2019s a misconception\nthat every U.S. employer is struggling to fill open positions. In 2019, KSM\nConsulting, an IT, data, and management consultancy, nearly doubled its\nworkforce. The secret? Mobilizing those best-equipped to advocate for the\nfirm\u2019s culture and work: current employees. KSM Consulting created an internal\nteam of recruitment ambassadors to descend upon professional development\nevents to network with potential job candidates. These champions were also\ninvited to share their stories in a series of videos featured in emails to\napplicants as they moved through the process.\n\nWith tools like Glassdoor, Comparably, and Indeed at employees\u2019 disposal, it\u2019s\nnever been easier for employees to weigh in on what it\u2019s like to work\nsomewhere. If employees believe in the organization\u2019s mission and enjoy\nhealthy relationships with their managers and peers, they won\u2019t think twice\nabout advocating for the culture. They\u2019ll happily share job postings with\nfriends and family. They won\u2019t hesitate to post about work on LinkedIn. The\nsecret to mobilizing these advocates is having a culture worthy of glowing\nreviews in the first place.\n\n**Disconnect 5: Engagement data not being sliced finely enough**\n\nEmplify\u2019s study found that, statistically, certain functional teams in an\norganization tend to be more engaged than others. Thus, the \u201cone-size-fits-\nall\u201d approach to improving engagement just doesn\u2019t work. Leaders and managers\nmust tailor their approach to address pockets of disengagement within the\norganization. This means gaining a deeper understanding of what\u2019s causing\ndisengagement for each business function. For example, those who choose\ncareers in sales and HR tend to be people-oriented and value friendship at\nwork. Since relationships have a big impact on engagement, it's no surprise\nthat HR and sales teams are usually among the most engaged across all\norganizations. On the opposite end, product teams in the study were the least\nengaged. These employees care deeply about seeing their work make a\ndifference, but are often the most removed from customers.\n\n**The Takeaway**\n\nAs we charge ahead into a decade of reimagined employee experiences, it\u2019s\nimportant to remember that \u201cculture-first\u201d also means \u201cpeople-first.\u201d Based on\nthese current disconnects, what action steps can you take today to improve\nyour employee experience?\n\n_Kevin Kruse is the CEO of_[ _  LEADx_](https://leadx.org/\n\"https://leadx.org/\") _, an AI-powered leadership coaching platform that helps\nmanagers improve their engagement scores.

In the 2019 survey it increased by 1 percentage point to\n63% - the highest level in the survey\u2019s 11-year history.\n\n* * *\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\n  * [\u2018I know I can count on you,\u2019 Sedwill tells officials as services come under coronavirus pressure](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/%E2%80%98i-know-i-can-count-you%E2%80%99-sedwill-tells-officials-services-come-under-coronavirus)\n  * [John Manzoni to depart as civil service chief](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/john-manzoni-depart-civil-service-chief)\n  * [People Survey shows awareness of 'Brilliant Civil Service' vision on the rise](https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/people-survey-shows-awareness-brilliant-civil-service-vision-rise)\n\n* * *\n\nOn a department-by-department level, staff at HM Revenue and Customs remain\nthe least engaged civil servants at any of government\u2019s main departments \u2013 as\ncategorised by the Cabinet Office.\n\nThe tax-collection agency has bumped along the lower end of People Survey\nengagement index scores for much of the barometer\u2019s life. The 2019 results\nshow it scoring 49% on the engagement index, the same as last year.\n\nMost engaged of the main departments was HM Treasury, which notched up a score\nof 74%, even though that was a one point dip on 2018.\n\nThe Cabinet Office\u2019s engagement index score dropped from 66% to 65% year on\nyear; while the Department for Education\u2019s index score rose from 65% to 69%.\n\nPerhaps not unconnected with the looming end of its existence, the Department\nfor Exiting the European Union marked a dip in its employee engagement score,\nwhich declined from 68% to 64% \u2013   exactly the same proportion it posted in\n2016, just weeks after it was founded.\n\nAnother department posing a dip in its score was the Department for\nInternational Development, with its 69% figure representing the first time in\nthe department\u2019s history that its engagement index was lower than 70%.\n\n**Pay-satisfaction rises 3%**\n\nAfter a year in which civil servants had less to cheer about in terms of pay\nthan counterparts elsewhere in the public sector, the 2019 People Survey shows\na three percentage point rise in satisfaction levels for both pay and\nbenefits.\n\nAccording to the data, 34% of civil servants agreed that their pay \u201cadequately\nreflects\u201d their performance, while 39% of respondents said they were\n\u201csatisfied\u201d with the total benefits package they received. Both scores were at\ntheir highest since 2010, when they were 38% and 39% respectively.\n\nThe proportion of survey respondents who believed their pay was reasonable\ncompared to that of people doing a similar job in different organisations also\nincreased by one point to 28% in the 2019 survey\u2019s results. The figure is also\na post-2010 high.\n\nCabinet Office perm sec and civil service chief executive Sir John Manzoni\nsaid the 2019 figures were based on sentiment from an \u201cextraordinary year of\nchange\u201d and were being published in the middle of an \u201ceven more urgent\nendeavour\u201d in the form of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cAcross the civil service there are some really positive survey results.\nScores in eight of the nine core themes showed an improvement, including for\n\u2018leadership and managing change\u2019, up two percentage points and its highest\nsince the survey began in 2009,\u201d he said.\n\nManzoni, who is due to step down from his civil service roles later this year,\naccepted that the survey results also showed areas where Whitehall could not\nrest on its laurels.\n\n\u201cWe would never pretend that there aren\u2019t areas where we can, and must, do\nbetter. For example, while average rates of discrimination have fallen\nslightly from 12% to 11%, bullying and harassment rates have gone in the\nopposite direction, rising from 11% to 12%,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is no place for bullying, harassment and discrimination of any kind in\nthe workplace, and I remain committed to stamping it out in the civil\nservice.\u201d\n\nManzoni said one notable positive movement was the continuing rise in the\nproportion of people who had been bullied or harassed reporting the problems\nthey were encountering.\n\n\u201cIt suggests greater awareness of the need to report \u2013 and how you can do it \u2013\nand greater confidence that the issue will be met head on,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the survey results, 51% of people who said they had been bullied\nor harassed \u2013 or both \u2013  confirmed that they had reported their experience.\nLast year\u2019s figure was 40%, itself up from 2017\u2019s 36%. The People Survey only\nbegan asking staff whether they had reported their experience of bullying or\nharassment in 2016. In that year the proportion of people who answered \u201cyes\u201d\nwas 36%.\n\nThe Cabinet Office said the 2019 People Survey had a 67% response rate, an\nincrease of 0.2 percentage points compared to 2018.\n\nAuthor Display Name\n\nJim Dunton\n\nTags\n\n[HR](/tags/hr)\n\n[Leadership & Management](/tags/leadership-management)\n\nCategories\n\n[Government and

The key, however, is to use them\nwell.\n\nEmployee experience journey mapping borrows directly from [customer journey\nmaps](https://searchcustomerexperience.techtarget.com/tip/5-tips-for-creating-\ncustomer-journey-maps-from-buyer-personas) \\-- only, in the former case,\nemployees are the \"customers\" and their touchpoints include everything from\nprehire and onboarding through to their exit from the company. As in the\ncustomer realm, HR should segment employees and build personas to understand\nimportant touchpoints and how well those touchpoints are meeting needs or if\nthey need improvement.\n\nUnfortunately, many companies don't seem to be using employee mapping well.\n\n[According to APQC research](https://www.apqc.org/resource-library/resource-\nlisting/engagement-employee-experience-survey-report), fewer than half of\nemployers are reporting being very or extremely effective at using employee\nexperience journey mapping to engage employees, said Elissa Tucker, principal\nresearch lead for human capital management at the nonprofit, independent\nresearch organization.\n\nMost of these employers and their HR teams are in the early stages of\nidentifying touchpoints or [moments that\nmatter](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/HR-response-to-\nCOVID-19-can-kill-or-boost-employee-experience) to their employees, she said.\nFewer employers are piloting improved or redesigned touchpoints. Given the\npotential gains in retaining talent and maximizing human capital investment,\nthe quest to perfect the employee experience journey map isn't likely to lose\nsteam anytime soon.\n\nHere are some guidelines HR teams can follow to create an employee experience\njourney map designed to boost morale, bridge silos and improve employee\nretention rates.\n\n### __1\\. Use empathy to understand touchpoints\n\nOne of the primary purposes of a journey map is discovering how well a company\nis meeting employees' needs and wants.\n\nCorrectly identifying touchpoints that matter to employees is an essential\nstep, Tucker said. It entails looking at the [employee\nexperience](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/definition/employee-\nexperience) through the eyes of employees.\n\nAdopting employees' varying viewpoints can be challenging, however, and HR\nteams may fall into the trap of old habits, yesterday's methods or confusion\nover the purpose of an employee experience map, too, she said.\n\nIt's easy to fall into the trap of valuing employee experience journey mapping\nas a useful business process rather than valuing the people the process\nilluminates. However, keeping the focus on individuals is the only way HR\nteams can ensure the process succeeds.\n\n\"A people-centric approach helps tailor experiences to the unique\ncharacteristics of an individual throughout their employment journey, from\nhiring to exiting, encouraging employee engagement and retention as a result,\"\nsaid Justin Black, head of people science at Glint Inc., an employee\nengagement platform.\n\n\"For each part of the journey, ask yourself two questions: What's the employee\ntrying to achieve, and what potential roadblocks [are] they most likely to\nface?\" said Pete Sosnowski, head of HR and co-founder at Zety, an online\nresume builder.\n\nIn other words, use a journey map to understand what employees experienced\nduring important touchpoints. Was a touchpoint successful, or did it leave the\nemployee unsatisfied -- and, if so, why? These are the types of questions HR\nshould be asking.\n\n### __2\\. Understand when to gather feedback\n\nWhile personalizing the experience means understanding what matters to each\nindividual employee, HR teams must be careful about how much involvement from\nthe employee they need in order to do the mapping.\n\n \"The crucial thing is not to ask for any information [about the journey]\nduring the application process because you don't want to overwhelm the\ncandidates as they are applying,\" said Dmytro Okunyev, founder of Chanty, an\nAI-powered team chat. \"Only ask for the crucial information which is necessary\nto get the candidate to apply.\"\n\nOnce candidates have accepted the job offer, that's when HR teams can [start\ngathering feedback](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/15-essential-\nemployee-engagement-survey-questions).\n\n\"Ask them to fill out a brief survey once per month, detailing their most\nimportant highlights in their role during the month,\" he said. \"You will be\nable to identify those crucial moments for each department, role and employee\nso that you can create better employee experiences when you hire again.\"\n\n### __3\\. Take a holistic view of the employee journey\n\nTo create an accurate employee experience journey map, HR should see the\njourney from a holistic perspective.\n\n\"The goal in creating an employee journey map is to [break down the\nsilos](https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/feature/Breaking-down-data-\nsilos-with-strong-data-governance) that might be standing in the way of an\nintegrated experience,\" said Kelly Ann Doherty, chief people and\ncommunications officer at Mr. Cooper Group, an online home mortgage company.\n\"Your employees don't think about every interaction they have with the company\nin those silos, so it's critical to think about the entire journey and how\neach group plays a role in the overall experience.\"\n\nFor example, IT can have a big impact on a new employee's first day, and the\nonboarding and training experience HR offers can influence someone's sense of\nbelonging. From employees' perspective, their workplace journeys are not only\ntheir specific jobs. Instead, companies need to include programs and\ninitiatives, such as benefits programs, workplace technology, corporate\ncommunications, development and recognition programs, and team celebrations.\n\n\"Each individual piece feeds a greater singular experience,\" Doherty said.\n\nAs part of this, it's important to look for the moments that matter most.\n\n\"As you build your journey map, look for opportunities to create peak\nmoments,\" Doherty said. \"It could be a program, perk, giveaway or experience\nthat's memorable and unique to your company, and those peak moments\ndifferentiate you as an employer and delight your teams.\"\n\n### __4\\. Reevaluate touchpoints over time\n\nAn effective employee experience journey map flows from employees' first\nencounter with a job opening through to their alumni status.\n\n\"For us, the employee journey provides a framework for viewing the employee\nexperience through a [long-term\nlens](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/10-ingredients-in-a-\nkiller-employee-experience-strategy),\" said Julie Meyer, director of talent\nmanagement at West Monroe Partners, a management consulting firm. \"Instead of\nthinking about an individual employee's experience as a 12-month sprint from\none annual review to the next, the employee journey reframes it as a\ncontinuous journey.\"\n\nTouchpoints will change, rise and wane in importance throughout the span of\nthe journey. They can rarely be captured in a frozen snapshot.\n\n\"To create an effective experience map, business owners and entrepreneurs\nshould realize that an annual or biannual engagement survey is nowhere near\neffective, and they should transition into a by experience- or lifecycle-style\ninstead,\" said Liz Brown, founder of Sleeping Lucid, a sleeping product review\nand testing service.\n\nFocusing on moments that matter helps ensure that results are accurate, up to\ndate and personalized according to roles, she said.\n\n\"Simply put, an employee journey mapping can only be effective if it's\nspecific, personalized and up to date,\" Brown said.\n\n### __5\\. Understand the employee experience extends beyond work hours\n\nToday's employees see their work experiences as part of their overall life\nexperience. By viewing the totality of a seamless experience, HR teams can\ngain important insights into what employees truly want and what might motivate\nthem to stay with the company.\n\n\"In today's tight labor market, employees, especially millennials, want a\nworkplace with a strong culture, one that values and supports them and is an\nextension of their social lives,\" said Jagoda Wieczorek, HR manager at\nResumeLab, an online resume creation tool. \"Experience is what matters to them\nmost, while compensation and benefits are just table stakes in attracting and\nretaining the best employees.\"\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on Employee engagement and recognition software\n\n  * [\n\n##### How to create an employee journey map\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/meltzer_rachel.jpg) By: Rachel\nMeltzer ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/How-to-create-an-\nemployee-journey-map)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Clarity key to Southwest Airlines smooth candidate experience\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/daniel_diann.jpg) By: Diann\nDaniel ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Clarity-key-to-\nSouthwest-Airlines-smooth-candidate-experience)\n\n  * [\n\n##### 8 HR technology trends CHROs should investigate in 2020\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/marson_luke.jpg) By: Luke\nMarson ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/8-HR-technology-trends-\nCHROs-should-investigate-in-2020)\n\n  * [\n\n##### 6 candidate journey mapping secrets savvy recruiters know\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/baker_pam.jpg) By: Pam Baker\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/6-candidate-journey-mapping-\nsecrets-savvy-recruiters-HR-pros-know)\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [How IT and HR can Partner to Deliver a Better Employee Experience](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/How-IT-and-HR-can-Partner-to-Deliver-a-Better-Employee-Experience) -Citrix\n  * [The Next-Generation Workspace: Removing Barriers and Frustration](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/The-Next-Generation-Workspace-Removing-Barriers-and-Frustration) -Citrix\n  * [Want Engaged and Inspired Employees?

Whether it was through Christmas bonuses, health care\nbenefits, or merely ensuring comfortable chairs at work, there have always\nbeen employers (albeit unknown and uncelebrated) who have tried to drive\nengagement at work. Having been through decades of slow evolution, it is not\nsurprising then that the basic map of employee engagement ideas that work has\nnot changed much.\n\nAre you stuck in age-old ways of engaging your employees?\n\nIs your idea of employee engagement still a boring survey followed by a\ncompulsory \"team activity\"?\n\nIt could often feel like we are drowning in the background noise of the same\nideas, just packaged differently.\n\nWhether we look at reports like Aon Hewitt's Global Trends in Employee\nEngagement, Quantum Workplace's Workplace Trends, or more recent reports like\nDeloitte's [Talent\n2020](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/mx/Documents/about-\ndeloitte/Talent2020_Employee-Perspective.pdf) series, what stands out is that\nin the last decade, there have been certain persistent trends in employee\nengagement.\n\nFor example, over the last decade, there has been a rise in the perceived\nimportance of the employee value proposition and innovation. These facets of\n**[employee experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-experience/)** have now been identified as key\ndrivers of engagement. How valued and supported employees feel has emerged as\nyet another metric that determines levels of engagement, as has the quest for\nmeaningful work.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **The Definitive Guide to AI in Employee\nEngagement**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/definitive-guide-to-ai-employee-engagement/)\n\n## **20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020**\n\nThe trends mentioned above, along with the growing emphasis on **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\nand employee experience, demand not only attention but action as well. So,\nlet's look at 20 fresh employee engagement ideas for 2020.\n\n### **1\\. Celebrate what employees achieve in their downtime**\n\n  \nHR should be mindful of an employee's 360-degree goals and targets, even\noutside the workplace. Someone may be an accomplished artist, chef, or\nmarathon runner \u2013 and recognition in these areas is as important as typical\nworkplace recognition.\n\nAn excellent employee engagement activity for 2020 would be hosting weekly\nmeetups where every employee/team shares stories of their downtime pursuits,\nwhat they have achieved and future hopes/goals.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How to Engage Employees in 2020: 10 Impactful\nSolutions**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/how-\nto-engage-employees-impactful-\nsolutions/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=4962&zd_term=prarthanaghosh)\n\n### **2\\. Upgrade communications to include video**\n\n  \nYour upgraded intranets, frequent mailers, and a cake-for-every-occasion can\nonly take you so far. They will not crack the code to the ultimate employee\nexperience. To truly provide the fabled \"holistic experience for a\nmultigenerational workforce,\" you must crack the video code.\n\nEvery employee is a consumer, and if video content works better for your\nexternal customers, it would work for your internal customers too.\n\nA video is also an excellent tool for pan-company announcements and to engage\nwith your deskless workforce, your gig workers, and your remote workers.\n\nEveryone loves a bit of the limelight, and broadcasting short culture-centric\nvideos of real employees speaking about their achievements and aspirations\nhelps to build a strong connection with the rest of your workforce. For people\nwho don't come to headquarters every day, videos can help them feel connected\nwith their teams and give them a sense of belonging and engagement.\n\n### **3\\. Give your pulse surveys a makeover**\n\n  \nWith Google Forms and SurveyMonkey, you can create pulse surveys with ease and\ncustomize them to suit your needs. But who says that a survey needs to look\nand feel like a survey? Ticking through boxes of endless options and choosing\nnumbers on a Likert scale are not the only way that your employees can tell\nyou how engaged they are.\n\nYou could ask for short WhatsApp voice notes not more than 20 seconds long \u2013\nan easy investment for your employees and for you \u2013 that encapsulates how the\nweek went. You could even do the same by asking them to upload a picture a\nweek.\n\nEmployees could also take a quick mood test, or engagement analytics tools\nthat study search trends within work systems that could give you a glimpse of\nthe general mood throughout the organization.\n\n### **4\\. Implement a non-anonymized survey to measure the engagement**\n\n  \nAnonymizing the results of an **[employee engagement\nsurvey](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nan-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-examples/)** has\nalways been a best practice. And this continues to hold for more formal\nsurveys, where you measure company-wide engagement/satisfaction levels. But\nyou could also implement a non-anonymized survey for small teams and employee\ngroups.\n\nMake this a fun employee engagement activity \u2013 hand out post-its after a\nmeeting where employees can jot down their feedback with a clear signature.\nThis will help them take ownership of feedback and feel like they are being\nheard as individuals, and not as an anonymized voice in a dataset.\n\n### **5\\. Enable remote working**\n\n  \nThe modern office is not a place but a function, and in our age of instant\n(and constant!) connectivity, this function could be carried out from\nanywhere. If your company policy does not allow a work-from-home option, it\ncosts you the chance to hire and engage a massive variety of diverse talent.\n\nIt is not just millennials who demand remote working tools and flexible\nculture. While they would make up 75% of the workforce by 2020, the minority\ngenerations at work would benefit as well.\n\nCreating a culture that is anytime-anywhere (by using collaborative systems\nlike Slack, easy video-calling solutions, and ensuring regular check-ins)\nmakes your mobile workforce feel valued and trusted.\n\nThat is a sure boost to engagement because then work becomes a more enjoyable\nexercise where employees' values, goals, and vision can coexist with those of\nthe organization.\n\n### **6\\. But say goodbye to the always-on culture for a week every quarter**\n\n  \nIt isn't always possible to switch off every time we step out of the office \u2013\nbut you could make it a mandate for at least one week a quarter, where\nemployees must remain unavailable outside of work hours. Convey clearly that\nno one should expect a response to an email or an instant message during this\nweek once the employee has left for the day.\n\nActivities like these are critical to reduce burnout and ensure that employees\nare adequately refreshed to maintain optimal productivity levels. They also\nhelp employees feel cared for, just like the company's customers.\n\n### **7\\. Encourage employees to become company brand ambassadors**\n\n  \nYour employer brand needs storytellers. Cultivating a band of employee brand\nambassadors serves a two-fold purpose \u2013 fostering a strong sense of pride and\nbelongingness within employees and building a credible employer brand that\ncandidates, clients, and external points of contact can believe in.\n\nWith employees being active contributors on platforms like Snapchat,\nInstagram, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor, the art of branded storytelling can be\nmore effective and is more critical than ever before. A lot of millennials\nespecially engage while engaging others and thrive in an environment that\nallows them to express their views and opinions on social platforms.\n\n### **8\\. Invest in gamification at different levels of the employee\nlifecycle**\n\n  \nWe've all heard of how gamified candidate selection or gamified corporate\nlearning has been creating ripples. But often, considerable shifts in\ntechnology and strategy are usually a \"them\" change before they become an \"us\"\nchange.\n\nWhile new-age technology can help you elevate gamification, you could put\ngamified processes to use even without futuristic tech. Game-based learning\nnot only boosts productivity levels, but also brings in a note of fun that\nencourages a bit of friendly competition, enhances collaboration, and elevates\nthe drive to succeed.\n\nYou could assign a day for some trivia quizzed on general knowledge and the\ncompany's brand or have a monthly tournament of Chess or Settlers of Catan,\nwhere teams have to collaborate strategically. Introducing relevant games such\nas these into the company culture would only enhance the overall employee\nexperience.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Employee Engagement vs. Employee Experience: Are They\nReally That Different?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-engagement-vs-employee-experience-are-they-different/)\n\n### **9\\. Offer a two-way mentorship program across departments**\n\n  \nTwo-way mentorship programs are an excellent strategy for upskilling and\nemployee engagement. They open up employees to new areas of learning and can\nserve as the key to unlocking hidden talent. It also helps employees\nunderstand their role in the larger organization.\n\nFor example, consider a two-way mentorship between a software developer and a\nmarketer. The former gets to know how their product is positioned in the\nmarket, while the latter receives a hands-on idea of the product they are\nmarketing. In the long-term, this strategy also has the potential to bolster\nyour productivity levels.\n\n**Learn More:** **[5 Key Learning Management System (LMS) Trends in\n2019](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/top-lms-\ntrends/)**\n\n### **10\\. Host frequent workshops**\n\n  \nAs adults, we tend to be averse to stepping outside our comfort zones and\nlearning new things. That is where fun workshops can shake things up.\nMoreover, this does not necessarily entail having to scour the market for\nexpensive coaches. You could source expertise internally as well.\n\nFor example, similar to the mentorship program, one of the coders could take a\ntwo-day workshop on basic HTML so that everyone in the product development\nteam knows what goes on in the backend. Workshops could also be engaging\nbrainstorming sessions or fun ideas like cocktail-making or baking that help\npeople get out of their routine while making them connect the balance of\ndifferent ingredients in a cocktail or a cake to the need for diversity at\nwork, for example.\n\n![employee engagement ideas](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. 20 fresh employee engagement ideas for 2020**\n\n### **11\\. Check your team's alignment to the organization's vision**\n\n  \nThe why of the organization \u2013 why it exists, why we do things the way we do\nthem, or why we wish to achieve one goal before another \u2013 is something that\nevery employee needs to understand and be on board with before they can truly\nbe engaged at work.\n\nVision alignment or being in sync with the vision of the organization is an\nessential pillar of engagement, and employees need to feel that the work that\nthey do matters and adds fuels the mission of the company.\n\nThe values and vision of the organization cannot exist merely on paper and\nwall-decals \u2013 they need to be lived every day. To do this, there should be\nenough scope for every employee to internalize what the organization stands\nfor and to align their own goals with organizational goals.\n\n### **12\\. Create an annual report of employee achievements**\n\n  \nAt the end of every year, companies publish a formalized annual report that\nshares its progress, achievements, and issues with the public. You can also\ntry a similar activity to increase employee engagement in 2020.\n\nReview performance data to find areas of outstanding performance \u2013 this could\nbe hard skills leading to business results, or soft skills that positively\nimpacted the work environment. Represent this data in a visual format, using\ncharts, infographics, badges, etc. This will encourage similar results and\nhigher productivity in the new year.\n\n### 13\\. Involve the entire company when onboarding new hires\n\nThis is particularly relevant for small-to-mid-sized businesses. Even large\nenterprises and 100% remote companies can leverage digital technology to\ngarner participation from every employee when someone new joins the company.\n\nHold a monthly onboarding day where the entire workforce gathers to welcome\nnew hires. You could also initiate a Slack thread called \"Hello! Let me tell\nyou about myself,\" where current employees (from interns to C-leaders) can\ntell the new hire something interesting about themselves. This will ensure\nthat employees are primed for engagement right from day one.\n\nBesides, for remote workers, instead of sending across the link to a recorded\nonboarding session, send them shorter video messages from team leaders and\ntheir teammates to inspire them.\n\n### **14\\. Invest in wellness at work**\n\n  \nA [report by Humana](https://www.humana.com/employer/group-benefits-101/after-\nenrollment/manage-employee-benefits/the-wellness-effect-the-impact-of-\nworkplace-programs/') called \"The Wellness Effect: The Impact of Workplace\nPrograms\" found that employee engagement and wellness are closely related. 67%\nof employees in organizations that prioritize wellness said that they felt\nmore engaged with the values and vision of the organization.\n\nWellness at work does not have to be a compulsory yoga class. Wellness\nincorporates within its umbrella physical, social, emotional, and financial\nwellness. Your wellness plan needs to be able to cater to all these aspects\nthat cumulatively ensure the holistic health of an employee.\n\nThere is also a need to destigmatize mental health challenges that many\nemployees could be facing but feel uncomfortable to ask about. Building\nsystems in place for decreasing workplace stress is more than an absolute\nnecessity.\n\nThis is an opportunity to help your employees understand that you care for\ntheir well-being, not merely to gain more productivity, but because that is\nwhat the organization believes in. Better performance is often just the\nbyproduct of a healthy workplace.\n\n### **15\\. Revamp rewards and recognition**\n\n  \nUsing AI to revamp rewards and recognition (R&R;) programs based on employee\nfeedback is a good way to get them more engaged. Employee engagement award\nideas that focus on rewarding behaviors that the organization values create a\nsense of achievement for being in tune with the culture at work. The process\nfor nomination or voting for this should be fair and objective. This helps\nfurther the cause of engagement.\n\nGiving out fun awards like the messiest-desk-but-gets-the-job-done, marbles\nunder their feet award, or an award for always thinking outside the box are a\ngreat way to get people to enjoy the process while also feeling valued and\nappreciated for what they do.\n\n### **16\\. Make diversity and inclusion the norm**\n\n  \nDiversity and inclusion is yet another facet of work that needs to become more\nthan just a mandate. It would be a fresh change for your employees to see the\norganization becoming more diverse. An environment that is an amalgamation of\ncultural, gender, and [generational\ndiversity](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/the-need-for-\ngenerational-diversity-in-workplace/) is perceived to be alive and\ninteresting, and employees of all stripes thrive there.\n\nMoreover, a culture that is sensitive to the needs thought patterns, and\nideologies of individuals from different cultures, backgrounds, and\ngenerations are automatically more engaging.\n\nTo truly promote inclusivity, your organizational culture needs to allow every\nvoice to be heard. This involves allowing expression to individuals from\nminority groups and those more prone to being discriminated against.\n\nWhile taking the human out of certain screening processes could do away with\nbias, installing feedback loop portals at work that address diversity issues\nlike 15Five, OfficeVibe and CultureAmp help in setting a mechanism in place\nfor employees to express their voice at work. Besides ensuring a better mix of\nideas and perspectives, inclusivity at work also makes employees feel valued\nas individuals and not just a member of a specific group.\n\n### **17\\. Encourage work-life balance**\n\n  \nWe live in a world where attaining a [work-life\nbalance](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/four-\nways-ai-is-improving-worklife-balance/) is still considered a victory, whereas\nit should be the norm. A regular working day should be one in which you get as\nmuch time for yourself and your family as you do for work. The idea is to\ncreate a schedule in which you do not feel like you are at a constant tug of\nwar between your duties at work and all that you want to accomplish outside of\nwork\n\nMaking employees always put in extra time and effort at work will lead to not\nonly burnout but also a noticeable dip in engagement. This is truer now when\nwe can always be connected to work, and where it could often be a challenge to\nswitch off our internal work mode.\n\nA transparent, open, and enabling culture would allow employees to share their\nvoice out in case they do feel that managing work and life is becoming\ndifficult. Interventions should then be arranged to find out where the problem\nlies and to make employees feel that they are not alone in their struggle.\n\n[Voice-of-the-employee\ntechnology](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-voice-of-the-employee-technology/), individualized [employee assistance\nprograms](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/benefits-administration/how-\nemployee-assistance-programs-improve-workplace-mental-health/) (EAPs), and\nguided group counseling sessions are some resources that could be put in place\nto create a culture that is inherently enabling and supportive.\n\n### **18\\. Plan creative CSR programs**\n\n  \nA [2019\nstudy](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283129700_Impact_of_corporate_social_responsibility_on_employee_engagement_A_case_of_Eskom_in_South_Africa/link/5a1f68e5aca272cbfbc2f166/download)\nfinds that employee engagement and corporate social responsibility (CSR) work\ntogether to achieve organizational goals. It also found that business success\nwas partly driven by employee engagement arising from CSR.\n\nA [study by Kenexa Research Institute](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-\nrelease/2008/09/11/1225374/0/en/The-Kenexa-Research-Institute-Reveals-Exactly-\nHow-Engaged-Employees-Are-and-What-Exactly-Employee-Engagement-Means.html)\nfurther asserts that how employees rate their pride in the organization, their\nlevel of satisfaction at work, and their willingness to recommend their\norganization to others is impacted by how they feel about the kind of work\nthat the organization does to give back to society.\n\nA genuine focus on CSR and [sustainability at\nwork](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/culture/4-tips-to-create-a-\nculture-of-sustainability-in-the-workplace/) and can help build a personal\nconnection between the organization, the employee and the society while also\nharboring a sense of gratification in being able to add value to society at\nlarge.\n\n### **19\\. Upgrade your EVP**\n\n  \nEmployee value proposition (EVP) and **[employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/)** are closely related and both fall on the employee\nsatisfaction/happiness spectrum. EVP plays a part in how the employee\nperceives the employer brand right from the first telephonic interview until\ntheir last day and their direct impact on the employees' level of engagement\nand involvement at work.\n\nNow is the time to upgrade your EVP \u2013 the promise that you make to your\nemployees. In a market as riddled with dynamism and as wrecked with the\ncompetition, it is always helpful to take a step back and analyze what sets\nyou apart.\n\nWhat is the USP of the employee experience that you are promising? How can you\ndeliver better on this promise and make your employees want to be engaged?\n\nAnswering these questions will help you move towards engagement practices that\nare more organic and less transactional.\n\n### **20\\. Empower line managers to own employee engagement**\n\n  \nIt is time to delegate the onus of employee engagement to individuals beyond\nHR. [A white paper by Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com/insights/whos-\nresponsible-for-employee-engagement/') shows that companies like Rackspace,\nAT&T;, Progressive Insurance, Intuit, and Cintas reported better engagement\nnumbers when line managers took charge of leading employee engagement instead\nof HR managers.\n\nThis is an important finding suggesting that business leads can empower\nsupervisors and hold them accountable for the engagement of their teams while\ncreating a steady feedback loop.\n\nThe onus of employee engagement should be divided between the HR, line\nmanagers, the individual employee, and senior leaders. Top-down commitment\nacross all departments is necessary to encourage employees' commitment.\n\nMoreover, employees would automatically feel more engaged if they were made a\npart of the decisions regarding employee engagement and felt that their\nopinions mattered.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **15 Essential Employee Satisfaction Survey Questions for\nYour 2020 Questionnaire**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-satisfaction-survey-\nquestions/?zd_source=hrt&zd_campaign=4962&zd_term=prarthanaghosh)\n\n## **From Theory to Practice**\n\nA [study by Gallup ](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236927/employee-\nengagement-drives-growth.aspx)found that teams that are deeply engaged are 21%\nmore productive. That's not all \u2013 Other research finds that investing just 10%\nmore in employee engagement can boost profits by $2,400 per employee annually.\n\nHow do you know whether your employee engagement ideas and activities are\nworking? Here are a few KPIs and questions that would help:\n\n**1\\. Engagement beyond work:** How many employees work outside regular\nworking hours (e.g., evenings and weekends)? Is this a good indicator of their\nown initiative, or were they asked to put in extra hours?\n\n**2\\. Broader corporate-social networks:** How many network connections does\nthe average employee have? How much time is spent with people outside of the\nimmediate team or region? This is a good indicator since passively disengaged\nemployees tend to have smaller social networks.\n\n**3\\. Participation without obligations:** What is the percentage of\nparticipation in ad-hoc meetings and initiatives that are unplanned and\nunstructured as opposed to recurring meetings and group events? For example,\ndo more employees attend team meetings where they feel attendance is mandatory\nas opposed to casual team lunches?\n\n**4\\. Branded communications:** Is any time spent in collaborating directly\nwith customers or outsiders beyond the normal scope of work? How are these\ninteractions? Is the company brand upheld with pride?\n\nThe KPIs and questions above are ones that you should keep an eye on.\n\nEmployee engagement activities must blend into a broader strategy and your\ncompany's culture to be truly effective. Without this, you are left with what\nJoelle Kaufman (CMO at Dynamic Signal) calls \"fireworks and smoke.\"\n\n\"One common mistake is what I call 'the fireworks and the smoke.' When it gets\nstarted, there's a lot of excitement, swag, a party. But a few weeks later,\nthe fireworks are over and there's just smoke. This is not a program or a\ncampaign. It's a fundamental way of operating. If you want to engage\nemployees, you have to be consistently putting out content that solicits\nengagement. It can't be just fireworks and smoke,\" she\n[said](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/interviews/employee-engagement/building-\na-culture-of-organizational-engagement-in-conversation-with-joelle-kaufman-\ncmo-at-dynamic-signal/).\n\nEmployee engagement initiatives should go beyond protecting the bottom line \u2013\nthey should be a way of life at work.\n[Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236927/employee-engagement-drives-\ngrowth.aspx) reported 37% less absenteeism, 90% less turnover, and 28% less\nsafety incidents in organizations with higher employee engagement scores.\n\nIf you find yourself stuck for new ways to improve engagement levels in your\norganization, give these ideas a shot. Remember to measure their effectiveness\nand keep modifying the concept to suit your employees' needs.\n\n**_Do you have any innovative employee engagement ideas?

Where we can add value, learn new things, make new\nrelationships.\n\nA 2017 study by The Engagement Institute found that disengaged employees cost\ncompanies up to $550 billion a year. Many of these costs come from higher\nabsenteeism and turnover. According to Gallup\u2019s employee engagement survey,\nbusiness units with a high level of engagement see 41% less absenteeism and a\n17% rise in productivity. Engaged employees are also much more likely to stay,\nwith turnover decreasing up to 59% in highly engaged units.\n\nThese improvements sound promising, but how do you get there?\n\nIf you\u2019re reading this article, then you\u2019ve probably learned the hard way just\nhow tough it is to engage your workforce. While engagement isn\u2019t easy, it is\nabsolutely achievable\u2014if you make the right changes.\n\n## 1. The Work Needs to Be Meaningful\n\n  \nPeople want to spend their time on something that will make a difference,\nsomething they think will make the world a better place, or something that\nwill help their organization succeed in that world. If you don't think your\nworkplace inspires this, consider the example of DTE Energy, a Detroit-based\nenergy company. Employee surveys revealed a widespread lack of engagement,\nwhich led to a crisis during the 2008 recession. Inspired by a board member,\nthe CEO decided to rally employees around the higher purpose of the\norganization, using a video that showed how each person supported the well-\nbeing of the local community. This purpose became a touchstone, integrated\nthroughout the organization, from onboarding and training to meetings and\nculture-building activities. Engagement soared as employees recognized the\npurpose as authentic, and they became personally invested in carrying out this\nshared mission. Since 2013, DTE Energy has received a Gallup Great Workplace\nAward for seven consecutive years, and the company\u2019s stock price more than\ntripled between 2008 and 2017.\n\nIn other words, people don't want to be treated as merely a cog in a wheel, so\nit's the leaders' job to define goals that are meaningful to people and help\nthem understand the importance of their function to the overall goals of the\norganization.\n\nConnect the goals back to your mission. Your mission spells out how you are\ngoing to change the world, what the purpose of the organization is. Every goal\nshould somehow move that mission forward, and every piece is important in\nachieving that mission.\n\nAnd please, forget about SMART goals. Focus instead on making goals\nmeaningful. For example,  improve the customer\u2019s experience in completing your\nsales process. That\u2019s something people can connect to, and they can feel good\nif they accomplish it because it makes someone else\u2019s life better.\n\nTake a look at the goals you set up:\n\n  * Are they motivating?\n  * Do they touch the heart as well as the mind?\n  * Do they connect to the mission? \n\n## 2. Work Should Be Achievable  \n\n  \nDon't get me started on \"stretch goals\" either. It's a bad idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople want to be successful, and your culture should support your employee's\nsuccess because people get excited and motivated when they achieve something\nmeaningful.\n\nPeople don\u2019t want to run around a hamster wheel\u2013they want to cross the goal\nline (which is why sports are so popular). You expend some effort, you train,\nand maybe you can be successful.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be successful every single time, in fact, it\u2019s important\nthat there is some challenge in the work, but not so much that people feel\nhopeless before they even begin.\n\nAll too often the boss assigns something to a direct report that he or she\nknows is not achievable \u2013 the timeline is too short, the technical challenges\nare too big, the budget or resources allocated are too small, or the person\nalready has more than they can get done on their plate and so there is no way\nthey can take on another assignment.\n\nCombine that with a culture in which the direct report is not allowed to say\nno or to negotiate the portfolio of work they have already been assigned or is\nbeing assigned and you have work that is not achievable and that is a heavy\nburden on anyone with a conscience.\n\nThey know from the start they are going to fail and setting someone up to fail\nis cruel. You\u2019ve robbed that person of the fun they could have at work \u2013 of\nthe satisfaction and engagement they could feel, and when someone is engaged\nand having fun doing the work, they do a better job.\n\nThere is an art to setting the right goals, with the right amount of\ncomplexity. But not too much otherwise it\u2019s unmanageable. And not too little,\notherwise it\u2019s dull.\n\n_That\u2019s how games are designed._\n\nIf you go to play a game that you know you will win every time without\nthinking, it quickly becomes boring. If you go to play a game that you know\nyou will never win and not only will you lose, but you will be punished for\nlosing, that sounds like self-inflicted torture to me.\n\n## 3. Collaborative Leadership\n\n  \nWork isn\u2019t fun when leaders spend too much time boosting their own egos,\namassing power and stomping all over the people who are lower down in the food\nchain.\n\nThis creates a toxic environment for anyone trying to actually get something\ndone. There are too many hoops to jump through, too many people to appease\nbefore that meaningful work can get done.\n\nLeadership should be there to support the meaningful, doable work getting\ndone, not get in the way of it.\n\nLeaders need to leave their egos at the door and let go of using their\nposition as a weapon to get what they want by imposing their will over others.\n\n_There is a better way and it\u2019s a collaborative approach to working._\n\nMost leaders lead directively \u2013 they tell others what to do. These others\naren\u2019t children, they are adults. They have supposedly been hired because they\nhave some expertise. But instead of supporting and nurturing that expertise,\nthey second-guess it; they micromanage. Or they bark out orders that the\nperson doesn\u2019t really understand and then leave them to flap in the wind.\n\nThere are more enlightened leaders \u2013 they think they are leading\ncollaboratively. They asked for their direct reports\u2019 opinions. They listened\ncarefully. They considered all sides of the issue and then they made a\ndecision. They explained the decision to their \u2018subordinates\u2019 and answered any\nand all questions.\n\nGreat, right?\n\nIt\u2019s better than the other examples, but it\u2019s still not collaboration.\n\nCollaboration is when the team makes the decision together, not the leader.\nCollaboration is when the leader really lets go of the power and after proper\ntraining in the right tools and techniques, turns over his power to the team.\n\n_Scary thought, right?_\n\nWell, think about why you might think that.\n\nAre you afraid to let go of control?  _Most leaders are._\n\nThey are actually addicted to control. Being controlled feels terrible and it\nsucks all the fun out of work. There is no engagement when one is being\ncontrolled \u2013 it\u2019s the opposite of engagement.\n\n_But it doesn\u2019t need to be that way._\n\n  * Stop focusing on profits and focus on purpose and how the organization is there to serve something or someone beyond itself.\n  * Set people up to succeed rather than to fail.\n  * Don\u2019t over-allocate resources because that makes the goals unachievable \u2013 people have too much to do.\n  * And let go of control and learn to lead collaboratively.\n\nEven though these things are difficult to achieve, it's not impossible--and\nit's definitely worth the commitment and effort \u2013 the effort to learn new\nskills, new tools, new approaches. That\u2019s the new game of leadership, and it\ncan change the world.  \n_The question is_  \u2013  _are you up to the challenge?  _\n\nRelated Tags:\n\n  * [Change Management](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Change%20Management)\n  * [Leadership Development](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Leadership%20Development)\n  * [Talent Management](https://www.td.org/search/?topic=Talent%20Management)\n\n[ ](https://www.td.org/user/about/JasonMyers-000001)\n\nAbout the Author\n\n[Jason Myers](https://www.td.org/user/about/JasonMyers-000001)\n\nJason Myers is a Principal with the Matrix Management Institute and is on a\nmission to help people transform their organizations into more innovative and\ncollaborative environments.

HR tech industry\nprofessionals weighed in on the topic at the HR TechXpo 2019 and others as\npart of the latest \u201cVoice of the Workplace\u201d pulse survey.\n\nOf those respondents, 92% said they would like to create a strong internal\nculture that affects results. In addition, 81% believed that investing in\npeople-focused programs and skills such as onboarding, performance and\nemployee engagement would help increase revenues and profit margins.\n\nLisa Hickey, VP of professional development at NCHRA, was \u201ca bit surprised\u201d\nthat only 45% of her group\u2019s members reported that their organizations are\nusing technology to improve employee engagement in the face of business\nvolatility and a tight labor market.\n\nNCHRA and Waggl, both based in the San Francisco Bay Area, also distilled into\na ranked list crowdsourced responses to a survey question about social media\nand gamification platforms as tools to increase employee engagement.\n\nSeveral caveats were expressed. One HR leader, for example, cautioned that\nthey need to be tied to the type of company and demographics, as well as the\nextent to which employees are willing to embrace change. Another respondent\nsaid it\u2019s important that gamification not be \u201cviewed as a nuisance and a\ndistraction from accomplishing job tasks.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that giving employees an opportunity to help shape their\norganization\u2019s culture, experience, vision and execution enables them to \u201cfeel\nmore connected to the workplace and empowered to drive change,\u201d according to\nAlex Kinnebrew, chief marketing officer and head of growth strategy for Waggl.\n\nBenefit brokers and advisers can play a critical role in helping their\nemployer clients bridge the technology gap when it comes to improving employee\nengagement, Hickey believes. \u201cFrom designing an offering that represents\ncompany goals to securing the best technology to administer the program,\nbrokers are guiding you every step of the way and also helping utilize\ntechnology beyond benefits administration that delivers more services and\nsolutions for the company,\u201d she says.\n\nFounded in 1960, NCHRA is the nation\u2019s second-largest HR association \u2014 serving\nmore than 30,000 professionals in 23 states and several countries and\nshowcasing more than 100 annual educational events.\n\nWaggl\u2019s Employee Voice platform examines critical business topics that include\nculture, experience, vision and execution. The company\u2019s management team\nincludes executives from Glassdoor, SuccessFactors and Coupa. Customers\ninclude Paychex, ebay, City Electric Supply, UCHealth, American Public Media\nand Freddie Mac.\n\n[\n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/474ad0d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x2400+0+0/resize/100x100!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Farizent.brightspotcdn.com%2F48%2Fb1%2F0266a0b2408b831cfa3cd586dc56%2Flinkedin-\nwebsite.jpg)

Nearly 44 million U.S. workers are\ncurrently running a variety of side hustles ranging from driving for ride-\nsharing companies, renting out their houses, or selling handcrafts online. But\nhow can you manage a side hustle in a way that brings maximum benefits without\naffecting your full-time job?\n\nThe authors conducted a series of studies with over 1,000 individuals who held\na variety of full-time jobs and side hustles, such as an HR coordinator who\nmakes and sells jewelry, a data analyst who delivers food for Postmates, a\nnurse who completes online surveys, and a graphic designer who does freelance\nwriting. They found that to thrive, moonlighters should probably pick tasks\ndifferent from their full-time work, pace their side hustle to avoid burnout,\nand make sure not to violate any company policies with their work.\n\nThe authors also describe the benefits of a side hustle: They allow workers to\nreap the benefits of independent work while retaining the stability of a\ntraditional role, thereby avoiding the major downside of full reliance on gig\nwork. They also offer empowerment as workers feel able to shape the work and\nits context. But like everything, the authors say you can have too much of a\ngood thing. Making sure you don't burn-out or drop your performance in a full-\ntime role is key to making your side hustle pay-off.\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2020/03/Mar20_18_CA33649.jpg) MoMo\nProductions/Getty Images\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2020/03/make-your-side-hustle-work?language=es)\n\nWith the rise of platform technologies and increased use of freelancers,\ncontractors, and \u201cgig\u201d workers by companies, it has never been easier to start\na side hustle to generates income on the side of a full-time job. [Nearly 44\nmillion U.S. workers](/2018/01/how-to-figure-out-what-your-side-hustle-should-\nbe) are currently running a variety of side hustles ranging from driving for\nride-sharing companies, renting out their houses, or selling handcrafts\nonline.\n\nOne reason for the surge in side hustles is the ease of starting one. For\nexample, to get paid for completing online surveys on Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk\nrequires a two-minute application and a brief wait for approval. To become a\nLyft driver, all you need is a valid driver\u2019s license, decent car, non-\negregious driving record, and a short online application. Even side hustles\nthat are more specialized, such as freelance graphic design or web\ndevelopment, can launch within a day or two by creating a profile on Upwork or\nother platforms.\n\nBut managing a side hustle is not without complications. We recently set out\nto understand the benefits and challenges of balancing a day-job while\nmoonlighting. To do so, we conducted a [series of studies with over 1,000\nindividuals](https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0164) who held\nvariety of full-time jobs and side hustles, such as an HR coordinator who\nmakes and sells jewelry, a data analyst who delivers food for Postmates, a\nnurse who completes online surveys, and a graphic designer who does freelance\nwriting. Participants worked on their side hustles for an average of 13 hours\nper week spread across 4 days, median annual side hustle income was\napproximately $5,000, and almost half of participants had more than one side\nhustle.\n\n#### Insight Center\n\n  * ###### [The Era of Job Crafting](/insight-center/the-era-of-job-crafting)\n\nSponsored by Upwork\n\nDesign the work you want.\n\nWorkers who exclusively support themselves with gig work [grapple with job\ninsecurity and struggle to find identity](/2018/03/thriving-in-the-gig-\neconomy), but many also find they can anchor the benefits of independent work\nto the stability of a full-time job. More specifically, we found that side\nhustles empowered individuals so that they feel they are the agent in charge\nof their work, which led to being emotionally and cognitively invested in the\nside hustle. Workers even carried forward the positive emotions associated\nwith this experience to their full-time jobs, which improved their full-time\njob performance. However, in certain situations, side hustles can distract\nfrom full-time work. Our research reveals numerous ways in which full-time\nworkers can best craft and choose a side hustle, build it up, and balance it\nwith full-time work and other demands.\n\n### **Choosing Your Side Hustle**\n\nFortunately, for those pursuing a side hustle, numerous options exist.\nAlthough the amount of income one can earn from a side hustle is certainly a\nkey consideration, we also found that the features of the work and motives for\ndoing it predict the extent to which workers feel empowered and engaged in\ntheir side hustles.\n\n**Features of the work.** Five key features increase enrichment from side\nwork. First, side hustles that provide autonomy by giving workers the\nindependence and freedom to schedule work, make decisions, and choose how they\naccomplished the work offer more enriching experiences. Likewise, side hustles\nthat involve seeing tasks through from beginning to end also tend to be better\nexperiences. Fortunately, side hustles tend to exhibit such independence and\noffer such discrete tasks given the nature of gig work. Thus, finding side\nhustles with these features should be relatively easy.\n\nThree other key features to consider when choosing a side hustle include side\nhustles that provide feedback, significance, and skill variety. In terms of\nfeedback, finding a side hustle that provides direct and clear information\nabout one\u2019s performance improves the experience of the work. Consider for\nexample, the instantaneous feedback provided to Lyft and Uber from rider\nratings and tips added to the fare. In contrast, performing a dog walking side\nhustle via the Rover app may provide less immediate and clear feedback about\none\u2019s performance and thus be less enriching.\n\nFinding a side hustle that is perceived to be significant (i.e., directly\ninfluential to the lives or work of others) should also increase enrichment\nfrom the work. As an example, in selling goods online, side hustlers are\nunlikely to deeply connect with the significance of the task, whereas a\nbabysitting side hustle via the Urbansitter app will likely increase\nperceptions that the side hustle is significant. Finally, finding a side\nhustle that involves a variety of skills should improve the experience. The\nskills can be those the side hustler already possesses, or even more\nbeneficial, may be skills the side hustler wants to further develop. For\nexample, consider the variety and breadth of skills one may use or develop by\nperforming a variety of jobs on TaskRabbit compared to the lone skill of\ndriving for a shared ride service. In short, finding a side hustle that offers\nautonomy, discrete tasks, feedback, significance, and skill variety will lead\nto more enriching experiences and help facilitate empowerment and engagement\nin the activity.\n\n**Motives for pursing a side hustle.** Workers that pursue side hustles do so\nfor a variety of reasons, and we found that the motives for pursuing a side\nhustle increased the chances that workers experienced empowerment and\nengagement in their side hustles. For many workers, side hustles are motivated\nby the pursuit of practical interests, such as increased pay and security. We\nfound that 45% of individuals said that their top motive for having a side\nhustle was to increase pay and prestige.\n\nOther individuals pursued side hustles for different reasons. For example, 34%\nof individuals said that their top motive for having a side hustle was a\ndesire for variety and autonomy. For example, a cashier may seek variety\nelsewhere by doing odd jobs on Taskrabbit, or an accountant may pursue\nautonomy as an artist on Etsy. Another 7% of individuals said their top motive\nfor having a side hustle was to increase social interactions and benefit\nothers within a side hustle. For example, an individual may choose to drive\nfor Lyft to increase social interactions or choose to teach at a community\ncollege in the evenings to benefit others. Holding these motives (i.e.,\ndesires for pay and prestige, variety and autonomy, and socializing and\naltruism) appears to have encouraged individuals to more actively shape the\nwork and its context, increasing side hustle engagement. Finally, we found\nthat 14% of individuals said that their top motive for having a side hustle\nwas to have more security and authority in their work. For example, an\nindividual may rent out a spare room on Airbnb to make sure they do not fall\nbehind on their mortgage payment.\n\nTwo significance implications can be drawn from these four side hustle\nmotives. First, side hustles motives go beyond merely increasing income.\nMoreover, having a more expansive portfolio of motivations for pursuing a side\nhustle, aside from merely making money, increases the side hustler\u2019s desire to\nbe an agent who actively crafts the role to serve their motives. In turn, this\ndesire to shape the work will increase empowerment and engagement in the\nactivity.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the experience of a side hustle will be best when side hustle\nmotives are congruent with the nature of the activity. For example, someone\nwith a desire for social interactions in a side hustle may be ill suited to a\nside hustle entailing completing surveys online but more well suited to\nbartending a few nights per week. Thus, choosing a side hustle should involve\nconsideration of congruence between one\u2019s motives for the activity and the\nlikelihood the side hustle will fulfill those motives.\n\n**Doing something similar to your full-time job or doing something\ndifferent.** Should a full-time accountant undertake individual tax returns on\nthe side of their full-time job? An advantage of holding such a similar full-\ntime job and side hustle is having a set of skills that facilitates both\nroles. This congruence may make managing and transitioning between the two\nroles easier compared to if the accountant performed a dissimilar side hustle,\nsuch as working as a wedding photographer. However, our research suggests that\noccupying a similar side hustle and full-time job may limit a sense of being\naway from full-time work as an individual extends the experience of a full-\ntime job into what would otherwise be non-work time. Ultimately, curtailing\ntime away from a full-time job by holding a side hustle that is similar to\none\u2019s full-time work may prevent recovery from the primary job. Thus, side\nhustlers will need to manage the tension of finding a side hustle that draws\non existing skills with the opportunity to add variety to one\u2019s work life in\norder to provide an escape from full-time work.\n\n### **Building Your Side Hustle**\n\nAfter choosing a side hustle based on features of the work, motives for\nperforming it, and the costs and benefits of doing something more or less\nsimilar to full-time work, workers have a couple of key decisions to make in\nterms of building their side hustle. Specifically, considerations ought to be\nmade for managing the pace of the side hustle, keeping the side hustle on the\nside, and disclosing the side hustle within full-time work.\n\n**Pacing your side hustle.** Some side hustles are easily scaleable at the\noutset. For example, on any given day, workers could complete more or fewer\nsurveys online, pick up passengers for a longer or shorter period, or deliver\na large or small number of orders for Uber Eats. For these side hustles,\npacing the work relative to full-time work and non-work demands is relatively\nstraightforward and adaptable. Other side hustles require greater\nconsideration regarding the workload. Some side hustles may involve developing\na relationship with clients and settling into a routine (e.g., tutoring, dog\nsitting, babysitting). Workers performing these side hustles may do well to\nbuild up a \u201cbook of business\u201d over time so as not to overcommit while finding\na sustainable workflow and to avoid taking on long-term customers who are\ndifficult. Finally, other side hustles, such as freelance illustration or web\ndesign, may entail large deliverables. Oftentimes such projects are\naccompanied by significant deadlines that may range from overwhelming to\ninfrequent. Such a \u201cfeast or famine\u201d workload may take a heavier toll on\nworkers who are trying to evenly pace their side hustle work from week-to-\nweek. Individuals who struggle to make and keep precise plans may want to\navoid the perils of such freelance work.\n\n**Keeping the side hustle on the side or making it full-time.** In our sample,\n17% of participants agreed that they would like to turn their side hustle into\ntheir full-time work someday. These participants tended to have side hustles\nthat aligned with personal interests (e.g., drone photography, woodworker,\nart, writing) but did not generate sufficient income. Regardless, long-term\naspirations for a side hustle can help with decisions about selecting a side\nhustle and pacing the work. Individuals who are looking for a side hustle to\nturn into their primary work one day ought to select a side hustle that is\nmore personally interesting than their current full-time job and yet has\nenough earning potential to be able to support oneself. An upside of side\nhustles is trying out alternative work to one\u2019s full-time job that can be\nscaled up or eliminated altogether as long as investing in the endeavor does\nnot threaten one\u2019s full-time job.\n\n**Disclosing your side hustle to your manager.** Side hustles entail\nperforming work outside of your full-time job, which many organizations could\nview as a conflict of interest, or an infringement of employment agreements.\nBefore pursuing a side hustle, individuals should check company policies to\nensure working on a side hustle would not be a violation.\n\nHowever, even if a side hustle is not a violation of company policy,\nindividuals may be hesitant to disclose their side hustle to coworkers or\nsupervisors. When deciding whether to disclose, workers should assess the\nculture of their organization to understand whether the organization is indeed\nopen to these types of opportunities. Consider whether or not you know of\nothers that also have a side hustle and whether or not they openly discuss\ntheir side hustle while at work. Another consideration is your relationship\nwith your supervisor\u2014do you trust them? Do they trust you? Are you risking\nviolating that trust if you _don\u2019t_ disclose your side hustle?\n\nOnce you decide to disclose to your supervisor, key items you likely want to\nhighlight to your supervisor include how you and your full-time work will\nbenefit from the side hustle and how you will work to minimize distractions.\nSome of the benefits to highlight to your supervisor include the skills you\nwill build or hone in the side hustle that you can apply to your full-time\nwork. For example, one individual in our research discussed how dealing with\nclients in her side hustle consulting business helped her improve in her full-\ntime job as a sales representative. Other benefits to highlight include\nactivities that the side hustles gives you that you may not be able to get\nfrom full-time work, but that make you overall more satisfied with life and\nwork. For example, another individual in our research who works for a Fortune\n100 corporation full-time in an HR role, discussed how creating beautiful\npieces of jewelry and selling them online allowed her to express her\ncreativity in ways she was unable to do in her full-time job resulting in\nincreased work and life satisfaction. Finally, share the results of our\nresearch that found an overall net positive impact for side hustles on full-\ntime work performance.\n\nYour supervisor may be concerned that the side hustle will distract from full-\ntime work. In our sample, very few workers worked on their side hustle during\ncompany time \u2014 so ensure your supervisor that you will not as well. Likewise,\nyou should also promise that you will not use company resources such as\ncomputer equipment or office supplies to aid in your side hustle.\n\nDistractions from side hustles can also be minimized by ensuring that you\ncomplete work or meet your goals. For example, you are much less likely to be\ndistracted by your side hustle on Etsy if you can fully complete the order you\nare doing for a customer during the weekend, rather than spreading it out over\nmultiple weekday evenings. Likewise, rather than splitting your time driving\nfor Uber before and after work, you may want to consider driving when you have\nthe most time to meet your daily goal for fares or consider setting a morning\nand an evening goal for fares.\n\n### **The Balancing Act of Full-time Work and Side Hustles**\n\nAlthough there are many benefits to having a side hustle, there are certain\npitfalls that you want to make sure you don\u2019t let overwhelm you.\n\n**Managing your energy.** The most common time for our participants to work on\ntheir side hustles was weekday evenings. Although it is tempting to slide\nstraight from your full-time work into your side hustle, or to work each\nweeknight or all weekend on your side hustle, you should find time to unplug\nfrom both your full-time work and your side hustle. Individuals in our study\nworked on their side hustles an average of 4 days per week \u2013 so limiting your\nside hustle to certain days of the week would be a good first step to managing\nyour energy. Side hustlers should also consider taking time between full-time\nwork and side hustles rather than starting side hustles immediately after work\n\nSimilarly, taking small breaks for even as little as 10 minutes during full-\ntime work or during a side hustle will also help to manage your energy.\nAlthough it is tempting to use breaks to surf the internet, send emails, or\nrun errands \u2014 the best breaks are those that allow you to detach from work.\nConsider taking time to focus on the meaningfulness or joy you receive from\nyour full-time work or side hustle. Take some time to show gratitude toward\nothers or help out a coworker. Take time to meditate and relax.\n\n**Draw from positive resources of side hustle work.** Although juggling full-\ntime work and a side hustle can be difficult, we also found individuals were\nable to draw from the positive resources generated from side hustles. After\nworking on their side hustles, many individuals in our study reported feeling\nenthusiastic, inspired, and excited the next day at work. Interestingly, we\nalso found that side hustles helped to offset negative emotions individuals\nexperienced from full-time work. That is, if individuals reported feeling\nupset, nervous, or distressed during the day at their full-time job, engaging\nin the side hustle again served as a positive resource for individuals by\nhelping to offset negative emotions.\n\n_***_\n\nIn short, we are proponents of side hustles \u2014 they allow workers to reap the\nbenefits of independent work while retaining the stability of a traditional\nrole, thereby avoiding the major downside of full reliance on gig work.

can positively alter the course of the success of\nyour company. But it can be challenging to measure in quantifiable terms. In\nthis definitive guide to employee satisfaction surveys, we tell you the 15\nquestions you can\u2019t ignore for the 2020 survey._**\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that companies that report a high level of employee\nsatisfaction enjoy better productivity and a sustainable business roadmap. But\nhow do you measure satisfaction in the workplace, given that it isn\u2019t a\nquantifiable metric like sales or revenue growth? And, how do you understand\nif your workforce\u2019s satisfaction levels are improving year on year?\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834cadce393.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nThat\u2019s where employee satisfaction surveys come in. These surveys can be\ndefined as questionnaires (either digital or manual \u2013 but they should be\ndigital, it\u2019s almost 2020) that help you collect data on employee\nsatisfaction. You can identify trends and benchmark them against internal\nstandards as well as external, industry-specific numbers.\n\nThere are 15 questions that belong on your employee satisfaction survey for\n2020 \u2013 but first, let\u2019s look at why these surveys should be a staple at your\ncompany.\n\n**Learn More:** **[What Is an Employee Engagement Survey? Definition, Process,\nVendors, and Examples](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-an-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-\nexamples/)**\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n  * **What does an Employee Satisfaction Survey Mean for Your Company?**\n  * **Does Your Employee Satisfaction Survey Include these 15 Vital Questions** ** _?_**\n  * **Best Practices on the Way Forward**\n\n##  \n**What Does an Employee Satisfaction Survey Mean for Your Company?**\n\nThere have been several studies linking employee satisfaction to business\nproductivity and growth. Not only does it impact an employee\u2019s likelihood of\nstaying on at their current job, but it also improves their well-being and\nhappiness levels.\n\nHere are a few metrics that demonstrate exactly why you need a job\nsatisfaction survey1:\n\n  * 51% of U.S. workers say that their job gives them a sense of identity \u2013 a sizable 47% say that a job is just something that they do for a living. If your company is where people come merely to make a living, you may be at risk of voluntary employee attrition.  \n\n  * Only a quarter of employees who quit a company are driven by their compensation. What about the other 75%? An employee satisfaction survey can help you find out.  \n\n  * Engaged teams are found to be 21% more profitable than disengaged ones. While employee satisfaction and **[employee engagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-employee-engagement/)** aren\u2019t synonymous, they are definitely related and need careful monitoring.  \n\n  * Finally, U.S. companies are spending $1 billion every year on turnover. Timely job satisfaction surveys can help you reduce this to a great extent.\n\n  \nWithout regular surveys/questionnaires, it is impossible to gather data on job\nsatisfaction. You might be relying on anecdotal evidence \u2013 but this is largely\ninaccurate and cannot power decision-making. That\u2019s why we recommend switching\nto a formalized employee satisfaction survey in 2020 with 15 must-have\nquestions in your survey.\n\n**Learn More:[Employee Engagement vs. Job Satisfaction: Key Differences and\nMetrics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/employee-\nengagement-vs-job-satisfaction-differences/)**\n\n## **Does Your Employee Satisfaction Survey Include these 15 Vital\nQuestions?**\n\nWhile there\u2019s no hard-and-fast rule, no more than 40 questions would make an\nideal employee satisfaction survey, especially if it\u2019s an annual/biannual\nsurvey. This means that even if an employee spends 30 seconds on each element,\nit will take 20 minutes of their time at the most. Pulse surveys, on the other\nhand, are far shorter, with three to ten questions asked at short intervals.\n\nToday, we look at the key elements that you should cover in your annual\nemployee satisfaction survey for 2020. As the future of work comes closer, it\nis crucial to keep sight of what it takes to keep the changing measures of\nemployee satisfaction in mind.\n\nWhile compensation is the one factor that remains a priority, the workforce is\nincreasingly placing focus on other factors, such as flexibility, quality of\nemployee benefits, and career development. Keeping this in mind, here are some\nessential questions that should make it into your 2020 employee satisfaction\nsurvey.\n\n### **1\\. How would you rate your work-life balance?**\n\n  \nWork-life balance is an essential determiner of **[job\nsatisfaction](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/job-\nsatisfaction-definition-factors-importance-statistics-examples/)** ,\nespecially for young professionals. 83% of millennials actively evaluate work-\nlife balance before joining a new job, and employees also favor work-life\nbalance over money. This means that if you\u2019re not performing well on this\nmetric, a wave of\n**[attrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-attrition-complete-guide/)** might be right around the\ncorner.\n\nDon\u2019t frame this one as an open question. Allow employees to rate this\nquestion on a scale of one to five \u2013 one being non-existent and five being\nvery comfortable. There should be clearly outlined descriptions for each value\n**.** You need quantifiable data about where you stand on the work-life\nbalance spectrum.\n\n### **2\\. Are you happy with the opportunities for personal and professional\ngrowth available in the company?**\n\n  \nIn many ways, employee career development is even better than employee\nbenefits, as it increases a person\u2019s overall employability. There are two\nsides to this question. First, employees should be optimistic about moving up\nthe ladder in their current department. Second, they should be getting enough\ntraining for non-linear growth.\n\nRemember, retaining an employee who has received in-house training can help\nyou save significantly in recruitment costs and the stress of looking for\nemployees to close the widening skills gap.\n\nAsk for a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d response to this question. It should be\nstraightforward, and if you have more nos than yeses, it\u2019s time to rework the\nprofessional development opportunities you provide.\n\n### **3\\. Do you have all the tools you need for optimal productivity at\nwork?**\n\n  \nOrganizations often fail to get this right. A recent report found that 76% of\nthe 1,000+ surveyed U.S. employees would be more productive if they have the\nright digital tools,2 but many companies struggle with the \u201cfear factor\u201d when\nit comes to new technology investments. Will employees use it? Will the\ninvestment fail? Will everyone adapt to the new technology easily? Who will\ntrain them to use the new technology?\n\nEmployees can answer these questions in their surveys. A negative response to\nthis question is a significant indicator of the lacking technology investments\nat work.\n\nThis should be framed as a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d question with no room for a\n\u201cmaybe\u201d or \u201calmost.\u201d Keeping it simple will help respondents to figure out\nexactly how they feel and share measurable information.\n\n### **4\\. Do you know what exactly your job responsibilities are?**\n\n  \nIn dynamic workplaces, it can often be difficult to pinpoint the exact nature\nof one\u2019s designation/job role. Many employees end up doing different work from\nwhat they were first promised. Several adhoc tasks are also added to their\nrole depending on the situation \u2013 for instance, another employee in a similar\nrole leaving the job. This can cause a bit of confusion and can disorient\nthem, especially new recruits who are still \u201cgreen between the ears.\u201d\n\nThis question, too, should be a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d question. If a majority of\nemployees answer \u201cno,\u201d you may want to begin by revisiting the job\ndescriptions shared with potential candidates and the actual role they are\nexpected to perform.\n\n### **5\\. Would you say that the distribution of tasks across individuals and\nteams is fair?**\n\n  \nThis is a common problem for large organizations, where responsibilities and\nownership for outcomes aren\u2019t distributed evenly across different teams. For\nexample, your sales executives might be doing a lot of the grunt work, while\nmarketing primarily sits idle.\n\nOn an individual level, employees might feel that they are overburdened.\nConversely, they have too few responsibilities and are feeling left out. An\nemployee satisfaction survey will detect these intricacies.\n\n### **6\\. How frequently does your manager recognize your achievements and\nefforts?**\n\n  \nRecognition is a powerful motivator of the workforce, and it can be a powerful\ndriver of employee satisfaction as well.\n\nTo obtain meaningful responses to this question, you should define clear\noptions such as \u201cevery day,\u201d \u201cevery week,\u201d \u201cfor every achievement,\u201d \u201crarely,\u201d\nand \u201cnever.\u201d These definitive words and phrases will help employees analyze\nthe culture of their immediate workplace and specify the frequency of\nrecognition they receive.\n\nBased on the results, you can take course corrective measures for particular\nemployee groups and teams, offering managers guidance on the best practices\nfor rewards and recognition.\n\n### **7\\. When was the last time your manager asked for your feedback?**\n\n  \nQuestions like this are instrumental in assessing employee satisfaction. They\nhelp you analyze the level and quality of communication between managers and\ntheir teams, how involved employees are in the decisions managers make, and\nhow this interaction affects employee satisfaction.\n\nYou can make this simpler by specifying options such as \u201clast week,\u201d \u201clast\nmonth,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d Employees should be able to voice their\nopinion and provide their feedback to their managers without formalized\nsurveys or questionnaires \u2013 and this can significantly dent job satisfaction.\n\n### **8\\. How often do you hear from your CEO? Do you feel connected to\nthem?**\n\n  \nThis question might sound slightly extreme, but a sense of interconnectedness\nand collaboration that cuts across hierarchical barriers can be hard to\nachieve. Typically, most of your workforce should feel engaged with senior\nmanagement and C-level leadership, hearing from them through direct\ncommunication channels such as Slack or company emails, or newsletters. In\nessence, employees must have transparency about the goings-on of the company.\n\nIf you find that less than 10% feels connected to the CEO, it may signal a\npressing concern. It means that on-ground employees aren\u2019t on the same page as\ntheir strategic leaders and are deriving very little value out of their jobs.\n\n### **9\\. How frequently do you feel stressed out at work?**\n\n  \nStress is now unavoidable in workplaces across industries and geographies.\nIt\u2019s such a pervasive issue that companies are now turning to artificial\nintelligence (AI) for stress management.\n\nIt is natural for employees to feel stressed out by their tasks occasionally\nand feel a sense of pressure. However, this cannot go beyond a certain\nthreshold, and there should always be a support system that helps to manage\nstress. Offer responses like \u201ctwo to three times a week,\u201d \"once a week,\" \"once\na month,\" and \"rarely\" to collect actionable data.\n\n### **10\\. Do you feel like you\u2019re living up to your full potential in this\njob?**\n\n  \nThis is another \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d question, one that should be present in every\njob satisfaction survey. A state where an individual isn\u2019t employed to use\ntheir maximum potential is termed as \u201cunderemployment.\u201d These individuals are\nlikely to experience poor job satisfaction and may always be on the lookout\nfor greener pastures.\n\nIf too many employees report underemployment, you could be missing the\nalignment of available talent to job roles. This is a significant action point\nfor HR and hiring managers. While yes and no responses will help to assess how\nmany people feel underemployed, follow-up questions will help to find out\nwhere the company or role is lacking.\n\n### **11\\. Was your last appraisal in line with your expectations?**\n\n  \nIt\u2019s vital to ask pragmatic questions like this one in your employee\nsatisfaction survey. Promotions and financial growth are a vital part of any\nemployee's career trajectory \u2013 if these needs aren't met, they aren't likely\nto stick around for long.\n\nOf course, mere performance reviews and your company's appraisal policies may\nnot always meet employee expectations. However, dissatisfaction numbers in\nthis area should be kept as low as possible, with a majority of employees\nachieving or exceeding their targets in the workplace.\n\n### **12\\. If you could add another benefit to your compensation package, what\nwould it be?**\n\n  \nHere come the open-ended questions where you ask employees to share their\nopinions and insights freely. This question will reveal gaps in your benefits\nplan and show you how to improve job satisfaction by offering as far as\npossible the benefits that employees desire.\n\nAnother benefit of asking this is that it assists future investments in\nemployee benefits. Why not directly ask your employees to choose from a\nbouquet of benefit options that you\u2019re currently considering?\n\n### **13\\. Would you say that you are happy working for this company?**\n\n  \nSuch questions invite introspection from your employees. Often, we do not\nconsider whether we are happy at work and continue to put in the hours while\nour job satisfaction levels steadily decline. After a point, however, this\nreaches a tipping point where the employee decides to quit.\n\nA job satisfaction survey should urge employees to self-assess their happiness\nlevels and point out any problem areas. Remember to make this an open\nquestion, allowing employees to respond and explain however they want to.\n\n### **14\\. If you could change one thing about your workplace, what would it\nbe?**\n\n  \nIt is unlikely that employees will be fully satisfied with their workplace.\nHowever, the answer to this question will indicate potential areas for\nimprovements and investment in 2020.\n\nYou could keep this either as an open question or specify options if you have\na hypothesis in mind. For example, if you think that long hours are becoming a\nproblem for the workforce, test out how your employees feel about it with an\nemployee satisfaction survey.\n\n### **15\\. How likely are you to recommend your workplace to a friend or a\nfamily member?**\n\n  \nThis element is critical to any satisfaction survey, whether you\u2019re targeting\nan employee or a customer. The result will give you the\n**[](http://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/employee-net-\npromoter-score-a-good-measure-of-engagement/)[employee net promoter\nscore](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/employee-\nnet-promoter-score-a-good-measure-of-engagement/)[\n(](http://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/employee-net-\npromoter-score-a-good-measure-of-\nengagement/)[NPS](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-net-promoter-score-enps-definition-measurement-examples-\nideas/)**[)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-net-promoter-score-enps-definition-measurement-examples-\nideas/). This is a measure of employee loyalty and their role as an employer\nbrand advocate.\n\nAgain, this question should come with quantifiable answers, preferably on a\nscale of one to five. If your ENPS is below the industry standard of 10\u201330,\nthe chances are that employees are sticking around only for compensation\nbenefits and may jump ship as soon as they find better compensation and better\nworkplace culture.\n\n## **Best Practices on the Way Forward**\n\nThese 15 questions cover the core elements of any job satisfaction survey \u2013\nbut keep a few best practices in mind when rolling it out to your employees.\n\n  1. Ensure that the data is anonymized so that employees feel comfortable being honest.\n  2. You can also repeat a question over multiple employee satisfaction surveys, helping you to identify trends in employee satisfaction over a set time period.\n  3. Always remember to mention something to the effect of \"choose the option closest to how you feel\" \u2013 your workforce comprises a diverse pool of individuals, and no answer will accurately capture their view. This disclaimer will improve participation rates and prevent employees from skipping the more difficult questions.\n  4. Invest in an employee engagement platform or a survey tool to administer an employee satisfaction survey. This will make it easier for employees to respond and for you to collect data and make sense of it.\n\n  \nWith job satisfaction becoming such a key area for organizations, a job\nsatisfaction survey is a handy tool to improve company culture and retain\nhigh-quality talent. By selecting the right elements \u2013 and phrasing them in a\nclear, non-ambiguous format \u2013 you can monitor and maintain satisfaction levels\nat an optimum.\n\n_Do you anticipate any challenges in conducting employee satisfaction surveys\nin 2020?

The survey is a confidential way for university leaders to collect\nfeedback in order to recognize what Vanderbilt is doing well and where\nimprovements are needed. The goal of the survey is to create a stronger\nworkplace.\n\n\u201cI believe that everyone can thrive and be successful at Vanderbilt,\u201d Interim\nChancellor and Provost Susan R. Wente said. \u201cWe are a cooperative and\ncollegial community that truly values what others bring to the table, and we\ndo our best work when we listen to each other, embrace different perspectives\nand take measurable action to uphold our principles of trust, transparency and\nteamwork.\u201d\n\nVanderbilt University-employed faculty will participate in the national\n[COACHE Faculty Job Satisfaction Survey](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/faculty-\naffairs/coache/) beginning the week of Feb. 10.\n\n\u201cI encourage all to participate in their respective surveys and to answer\nquestions openly and honestly,\u201d Wente said. \u201cThe Staff Engagement Survey and\nCOACHE faculty survey both will serve to support our overall commitment to\nlistening to our community to inform future action.\u201d\n\nThe two surveys are the latest in a [series of\nefforts](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2019/03/11/survey-series-will-seek-\nfeedback-from-campus-community-on-key-issues/) by university leaders to seek\nfeedback from the Vanderbilt community on key issues. Among staff, these\nefforts have included [campus listening\nsessions](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2019/09/18/university-administrators-to-\nlaunch-staff-listening-tour-sept-27/) hosted by Interim Vice Chancellor for\nEquity, Diversity and Inclusion and Chief Diversity Officer Dr. Andr\u00e9 L.\nChurchwell, Vice Chancellor for Administration Eric Kopstain and Interim\nAssociate Vice Chancellor for People and Business Services Laura Nairon during\nthe fall 2019 semester. The [staff listening sessions will resume on Feb.\n14](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/02/06/spring-staff-listening-tour-kicks-\noff-feb-14/) and include Senior Associate Vice Chancellor for Public Safety\nand Special Initiatives August Washington along with the other leaders.\n\nAll part-time and full-time benefits-eligible staff are eligible to take the\nStaff Engagement Survey, which will be administered by Gallup, an independent\nresearch-based consulting company. The confidential web-based survey consists\nof approximately 40 questions and should take no longer than 10 minutes to\ncomplete. The survey will be available in English, Spanish, French and Arabic,\nand translation help will be available for Bosnian/Serbo-Croatian, Swahili and\nKurdish speakers.\n\n#### **Taking the Staff Engagement Survey**\n\n  * Staff members will receive instructions in an email from [Support@mail.gallup.com](mailto:Support@mail.gallup.com). The subject line will include **Vanderbilt Staff Engagement Survey**.\n  * If you don\u2019t see the survey invitation in your email inbox, make sure to check your Focused/Other and Junk folders in Outlook. If you still don\u2019t see the invitation, please contact [EmployeeEngagementSurvey@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:EmployeeEngagementSurvey@vanderbilt.edu).\n  * The confidential survey is taken online, and paper versions will not be available. A computer lab for employees who do not have computer access will be held in the **Baker Building 10th Floor Training Room** at the following time: **Feb. 19: 4\u20137 p.m.**\n  * The survey will close on Friday, Feb. 21.\n\n#### **Survey is confidential**\n\nGallup will administer the entire survey independently of Vanderbilt. The\nuniversity only receives the aggregated results.\n\nIf you are in a small department, your answers will be combined with other\nresponses to ensure confidentiality. If an insufficient number of staff\nparticipate in the survey in any given workgroup, the report will show results\nfor larger, relevant groups in the organization. No one at Vanderbilt will\nhave access to data that identifies specific staff responses.\n\n#### **Measuring engagement and reporting results**\n\nThe survey will measure staff engagement, which indicates employees\u2019\ninvestment in and enthusiasm for their work. An engaged staff member is in a\nrole that uses their talents; they know the scope of their job; and they are\nalways looking for new and different ways to achieve the outcomes of their\nrole. The survey is focused on items aimed at measuring the individual needs\nof staff and the degree to which Vanderbilt is providing clarity, support,\nencouragement and development for all.\n\nVanderbilt leadership will use the survey\u2019s findings to identify priorities\nfor providing the information, resources and support staff need to carry out\nthe work and mission of the university. Managers will use the results to\ncreate action plans with their teams to address areas of concern, such as\nculture, relationships with supervisors, training and education opportunities,\npay and benefits, communication, and work environment. Following the survey,\nthere will be opportunities to provide additional feedback through focus\ngroups facilitated by Gallup.\n\nFor more information, visit the [2020 Staff Engagement Survey\nwebpage](https://hr.vanderbilt.edu/2020StaffSurvey.php).\n\nFor questions, contact\n[EmployeeEngagementSurvey@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:EmployeeEngagementSurvey@vanderbilt.edu).\n\n## Keep Reading\n\n[![Story Photo](https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-\nnews/files/20200129043539/Staff_Engagement_Survey_slider.jpg)\n\nMake your voice heard: Staff and faculty surveys launching in February\n\n](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/01/29/make-your-voice-heard-staff-and-\nfaculty-surveys-launching-in-february/)\n\n[![Story Photo](https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-\nnews/files/20200115084308/Mr_C_bus_1-750x410.jpg)\n\nProvide feedback on Nashville\u2019s transportation challenges at upcoming public\nlistening sessions\n\n](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/01/15/make-your-voice-heard-provide-\nfeedback-on-nashvilles-transportation-challenges-at-upcoming-public-listening-\nsessions/)\n\n[![Story Photo](https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-\nnews/files/20190909103116/OpenMindLogo-795x410.png)\n\nOpen Mind: Many voices make our One Vanderbilt stronger\n\n](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2020/02/10/open-mind-many-voices-make-our-one-\nvanderbilt-stronger/)\n\n#### Share This Story\n\n### Media Inquiries\n\n(615) 322-NEWS * [__](mailto:media@vanderbilt.edu?subject=Question about\nVanderbilt story \\(Make your voice heard: Take the Staff Engagement Survey\nthrough Feb. 21\\))\n\n### Explore Story Topics\n\n[myVU](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/section/myvu/) [myVU\nNews](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/section/myvu/myvu-news/) [hr-\nannouncements](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/tag/hr-announcements/) [hr-\nhighlights](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/tag/hr-highlights/) [Office of the\nProvost](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/tag/office-of-the-provost/) [Staff\nEngagement Survey](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/tag/staff-engagement-survey/)\n[survey](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/tag/survey/) [Susan R.\nWente](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/tag/susan-r-wente/)\n\n### Subscribe\n\nThere are lots of ways to keep up with Vanderbilt.

WIRE](https://www.businesswire.com/))--Wellness Coach, the\nSoftbank-funded enterprise wellness startup offering mental and physical\nwellness tools to 200+ companies globally, today announced the findings of its\nQ1 2020 \u201cEmployee Wellness Index\u201d (EWI) and data related to the impact of the\nCOVID-19 virus on employee wellness.\n\n> After a successful completion of its initial $3 million capital investment\n> led by SoftBank Capital NY and the launch of its live mediation, sleep music\n> and fitness classes last year, the company has witnessed rapid growth of\n> over 200 enterprise clients in less than a year. Since the Covid-19\n> pandemic, the company is adding 10+ companies a day to their platform and\n> has been offering companies a free, 90-day trial for new enterprise\n> customers in hopes of easing stress in the nation.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nWellness Coach analyzed a sample 100+ companies and thousands of anonymous\nemployee wellness class usage data to show overall trends. For vertical\nresults, the company looked at 10+ companies in the vertical to draw vertical\nconclusions.\n\n**Key Findings**\n\n  * After seeing a normal drop-off in emotional intelligence, focus, stress and relaxation class attendance over the November 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 timeframe as employees spent more time with family over the holidays, the company saw an 86% increase in fitness class attendance due to New Year\u2019s resolutions \n  * As the COVID-19 pandemic became more pronounced in March, class attendance related to stress increased 52% month-over-month, with emotional intelligence classes dropping by 32% and relaxation classes increasing by 17% month-over-month \n  * As it relates to the heavily hit Advertising and Travel sectors, \n    * Fitness classes increased by 250% (yoga, fitness and home fitness) month-over-month \n    * Relaxation Increased by 70% (working from home, listing to music while working) \n    * Stress-related classes increased 60% (more breathing exercises, anxiety exercise) \n    * Emotional intelligence classes dropped by 48%, \n    * Sleep (bedtime stories, sleep meditations and music) dropped by 25%, \n\n\u201cThe Employee Wellness Index gives companies a real-time look at the needs of\ntheir employees, based on the classes employees are attending,\u201d said D.\nSharma, Co-Founder and CEO of Wellness Coach. \u201cThe impact on COVID-19 related,\nemployee stress is significant. We are seeing a shift from more work-related\nclasses (emotional intelligence) to stress management tools. Work from home\nand the harder-hit travel and advertising sector saw a much higher increase in\nstress, as they are coping with taking care of their body and mind by working\nout, relaxing and using tools to alleviate stress.\u201d\n\n**Background**\n\nFor decades, employers have relied on archaic surveys to understand employee\nengagement and morale. Now, with the enterprise \u201cEmployee Wellness Index,\u201d\nemployers have insights to their employees most basic needs, including\nFitness, Focus, Relaxation, Emotional Intelligence, Stress, Sleep and\nNutrition. Employers track these metrics month-over-month to see how internal\nenterprise factors affect the needs of employees and then take steps to\nimprove employee overall wellness. The Employee Wellness Index can be provided\nby various office locations to help companies with larger, global teams know\nthe needs of their employees, companywide.\n\n**About D.

To do our part during this tumultuous\nand unprecedented time, we're providing Butterfly software and robust support\nfree of cost to companies grappling with these changes.\"\n\nButterfly software can be put in place in less than 24 hours, enabling\nmanagers to see results immediately and providing organization-wide reports\nthat help assess bigger trends across the workforce.\n\n **Recommended AI News:**[TCS Recognized as Leader of the Year in Life\nSciences by Everest\nGroup](https://www.aithority.com/technology/blockchain/tcs-recognized-as-\nleader-of-the-year-in-life-sciences-by-everest-group/ \"TCS Recognized as\nLeader of the Year in Life Sciences by Everest Group\")\n\nThe free license lasts for 90 days, allowing managers to send pulse surveys to\ntheir deskless employees. These weekly surveys ask employees to respond to key\nstatements, like \"I have access to the resources I need to do my job\neffectively,\" and \"If I do great work, I know my manager will recognize it.\"\nEmployees can also rate their happiness, which provides managers with a more\nemotional and personal assessment.\n\nSurveys can be completed quickly and anonymously via text, email, Kronos\nWorkforce Dimension, and many other systems. Responses are collected instantly\nand are accessible for managers through a dashboard.\n\n **Recommended AI News:**[India Fights COVID-19: PM Narendra Modi Declares\n21-Day Lockdown](https://www.aithority.com/ait-featured-posts/india-fights-\ncovid-19-pm-narendra-modi-declares-21-day-lockdown/ \"India Fights COVID-19: PM\nNarendra Modi Declares 21-Day Lockdown\")\n\n[Butterfly](https://www.aithority.com/tag/butterfly/)\n[COVID-19](https://www.aithority.com/tag/covid-19/) [David\nMendlewicz](https://www.aithority.com/tag/david-mendlewicz/) [employee\nengagement software](https://www.aithority.com/tag/employee-engagement-\nsoftware/) [frontline workforce](https://www.aithority.com/tag/frontline-\nworkforce/) [news](https://www.aithority.com/tag/news/) 2020-03-26\n\n**[AIT News Desk](https://www.aithority.com/author/ait-news-desk/ \"Posts by\nAIT News Desk\") **\n\nTags [Butterfly](https://www.aithority.com/tag/butterfly/)\n[COVID-19](https://www.aithority.com/tag/covid-19/) [David\nMendlewicz](https://www.aithority.com/tag/david-mendlewicz/) [employee\nengagement software](https://www.aithority.com/tag/employee-engagement-\nsoftware/) [frontline workforce](https://www.aithority.com/tag/frontline-\nworkforce/) [news](https://www.aithority.com/tag/news/)\n\n[__\nTwitter](http://twitter.com/home?status=https://www.aithority.com/hrtechnology/butterfly-\noffers-free-employee-engagement-software-for-frontline-workforce/\n\"Butterfly+Offers+Free+Employee+Engagement+Software+for+Frontline+Workforce\")\n[__\nFacebook](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.aithority.com/hrtechnology/butterfly-\noffers-free-employee-engagement-software-for-frontline-workforce/) [__ Google\n+](https://plusone.google.com/_/+1/confirm?hl=en&url=https://www.aithority.com/hrtechnology/butterfly-\noffers-free-employee-engagement-software-for-frontline-workforce/) [__\nlinkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.aithority.com/hrtechnology/butterfly-\noffers-free-employee-engagement-software-for-frontline-workforce/ \"Butterfly\nOffers Free Employee Engagement Software for Frontline Workforce\") More\n\n###  Authors\n\n![AIT News Desk](https://www.aithority.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/12/Newsdesk-180-x-180-150x150.jpg)\n\nPosted by : [AIT News Desk](https://www.aithority.com/author/ait-news-desk/\n\"Posts by AIT News Desk\")\n\nAIT News Desk is a trained group of web journalists and reporters who collect\nnews from all over the technology landscape.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nNatalie Baumgartner\n\nNatalie Baumgartner, Ph.D. is Chief Workforce Scientist at\n[Achievers](http://www.achievers.com/), a leading employee engagement\nplatform.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nOnce upon a time, companies distributed annual surveys to employees so they\ncould get a sense of general office sentiment and solicit feedback. However,\nin the current tight employment market where organizations are racing to\ncompete for the best talent and implement strong company cultures to retain\ntheir high performers, annual surveys aren\u2019t enough. And knowing the impact of\nculture on a company's\n[profitability](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236927/employee-engagement-\ndrives-growth.aspx), the importance of engaging employees is clearer than\never.\n\nWe\u2019ve been treating engagement as if it were static (can be measured\nperiodically), generic (is responsive to one-size-fits-all solutions) and\nautomatic (will be impacted simply through measurement or the use of complex\naction plans). Meanwhile, we know that engagement is exceptionally fluid and\nhighly personal, and it requires effective translation to action. That's why\nannual surveys alone can no longer be a company\u2019s key mechanism for measuring\nand driving engagement.\n\n**Engagement Is Fluid; Data Needs To Be Real-Time**\n\nThere is a huge difference between companies that set out to collect an\nengagement score and companies that treat engagement as a \u201cliving,\u201d changing\naspect of the employee experience. For companies to have valid data that\ninforms the way they support and build the best possible employee experience,\nthey need to be gathering and measuring engagement in a fluid way. All too\noften data is gathered infrequently and is viewed as sufficient because \u201cwe\nhave a good score\u201d \u2014 but then the data goes into a black hole. Instead, HR and\nbusiness leaders need to use real-time engagement information to drive both\nhuman capital and business objectives, every day.\n\nInfrequent engagement initiatives can lead to more problems than solutions, as\nemployees dutifully fill out surveys, but nothing comes of it. What\u2019s more, if\na company only measures engagement once a year, it will be relying on data\nthat\u2019s aged-out. The engagement of employees changes every single day \u2014 and\nmany times throughout the day \u2014 so, once engagement data is weeks and months\nold, it very likely doesn\u2019t reflect what\u2019s actually happening within the\norganization.\n\nTo be able to truly drive engagement and culture, companies first must buy\ninto the concept that engagement is important, and then that it\u2019s critical to\nmeasure (and act on) frequently. Many companies are stuck in a once-a-year\nengagement survey pattern. Often, this stems from a sensitivity regarding HR\nmaking asks of employees outside of their normal work flow, like engagement\nsurveys. However, once we understand the fluid nature of engagement, we can\nsee that simply treating it as an annual measurement exercise is clearly a\nmiss.\n\n** ** **Cadence Of Measuring Engagement**\n\nSo, what\u2019s the right cadence for measuring employee engagement?\n\nOrganizations need to measure frequently enough so they\u2019re getting real-time,\naccurate data, but also need to ensure there\u2019s time to act on data, to effect\nchange. A regular cadence of three to four times a year is ideal to inform a\nbetter employee experience, as companies ought to then have adequate time\nbetween surveys to implement micro-actions (or bite-sized movements), which\nare critical for making efficient change. I\u2019ve seen employees appreciate this\nschedule and be incredibly willing to participate when there\u2019s an open\ndialogue, especially when they see their feedback addressed.\n\nAll of that said, a continuous form of measurement requires organizations to\nput the right tools in place, breaking from traditions of long-form survey\nmethods. The method of more frequent gathering and measuring requires a new\napproach. In the past few years, the concept of pulse surveys has emerged.\nInstead of long-winded surveys employees fill out annually, pulse surveys\nmeasure the same sentiments with an abbreviated format, which offers a more\nconstant view of engagement. Pulse \u2014 or even \"always on\" \u2014 surveying works\nwell when looking to increase the frequency of engagement measurement.\n\nAccessing employee engagement through different methods and across different\nintervals throughout the year helps to ensure you won\u2019t miss critical data \u2014\nan employee who is happy one quarter but disengaged the next \u2014 and you will\nhave a truly accurate picture of engagement levels.\n\n** ** **Translating Data Into Action**\n\nOnce there\u2019s a regular survey measurement process in place, it doesn\u2019t mean\nour work is done. Remember, engagement isn\u2019t a check-the-box activity. After\nwe collect the data, it\u2019s time to use it to inform action. This is the most\ncritical step in engagement management and really the sole reason for\ninstituting real-time measurement. I\u2019ve witnessed several organizations that\nhave looked great on paper with high engagement scores, but then didn\u2019t\nconsistently follow up on measurement and failed to catch the changing tides\nof employee sentiment.\n\nSo, how can companies ensure their measurement is really working?\n\nIn employee surveys, ask for feedback around specific issues, and track to see\nif the experience around those issues has changed. Ask questions to slice the\ndata for a specific team versus enterprisewide to home in on engagement\nchallenges in a certain role or location. For example, has work-life balance\nin a certain region become an issue?\n\nThen, to ensure the data drives change, engage in simple, short-term action.\nOne of the biggest impediments of improving engagement is the implementation\nof complex plans that are cumbersome to move forward. Translating engagement\ndata into two or three bite-sized actions that a manager can get done between\neach measurement period is far more achievable \u2014 and much more effective.\n[Seventy percent](https://news.gallup.com/businessjournal/182792/managers-\naccount-variance-employee-engagement.aspx) of the variance in employee\nengagement scores can be linked back to managers, so it\u2019s crucial they\u2019re\nempowered to translate feedback into action, quickly.\n\nSince employee engagement is constantly changing, even a company that already\nhas engagement measurement in place needs to carefully consider whether\nthere\u2019s room for improvement. Measuring what truly matters on a schedule that\nprovides real-time insight will allow leaders to better understand their\nworkforce and take action to deliver a more engaging overall workplace\nexperience.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Natalie Baumgartner](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2019/01/nataliebaumgartner1_avatar_1546616293-400x400.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/nataliebaumgartner1/\n\"Photo of Natalie Baumgartner\")\n\n[Natalie\nBaumgartner](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/nataliebaumgartner1/)\n\nNatalie Baumgartner, Ph.D. is Chief Workforce Scientist at\n[Achievers](http://www.achievers.com), a leading employee engagement platform.\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: Natalie Baumgartner&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: How To Measure What Matters In Employee Engagement %0A Author: Natalie Baumgartner %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2019/05/22/how-to-measure-what-matters-in-employee-engagement/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

The goal is not to survey our employees, find out that they\u2019re\nunhappy, and then say, \u201cOh well, nothing we can do about it.\u201d Without serious\naction and communication, an employee engagement survey is, at best, a waste\nof time.\n\nOne of the essential action and communication steps that must be taken\nimmediately after an engagement survey is closing the loop with employees and\nshowing them the survey results. And ideally, this is done via department\nmanagers (those leaders who are closest to the employees who took the survey).\n\nUnfortunately, this is not happening nearly as frequently as it should be.\n\nMore than 10,000 HR executives have taken the online test \u201c[How Good Is Your\nEmployee Engagement\nSurvey?](https://www.leadershipiq.com/blogs/leadershipiq/91657409-quiz-how-\ngood-is-your-employee-engagement-survey)\u201d One of the questions asks, \u201cDo all\nof your department managers (or equivalent) share their area's survey results\nwith the employees in that area?\u201d and gives the following four choices for\nanswering the question:\n\n  1. All of the managers share the area results with their employees.\n  2. Most of the managers share the area results with their employees.\n  3. A few of the managers share the area results with their employees.\n  4. None of the managers share the area results with their employees.\n\nToday In: [Careers](https://www.forbes.com/careers)\n\n  * [\n\n### Challenges And Solutions For The Hard Of Hearing In The World Of Remote\nWork\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hvmacarthur/2020/04/07/challenges-and-\nsolutions-for-the-hard-of-hearing-in-the-world-of-remote-work/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Recession-Proof Your Income In A Career You Love\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dawngraham/2020/04/07/recession-proof-your-\nincome-in-a-career-you-love/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Be Successful But Don\u2019t Forget To Enjoy Your Life\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgriffin/2020/04/07/be-successful-but-dont-\nforget-to-enjoy-your-life/)\n\nClearly, only choice #1 is a really good answer. But as you can see in the\nchart below, only 29% of companies say that \u2018All of the managers share the\narea results with their employees.\u2019\n\n![employee survey data](https://specials-\nimages.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5d7c3ce0aea4d300086c74fd/960x0.jpg?fit=scale)\n\nData from the test \u201cHow Good Is Your Employee Engagement Survey?\u201d\n\nLeadership IQ\n\nWhat are the chances that employees will just take it on faith that the\nresponses they gave on the survey will be taken seriously, prioritized, and\nacted upon? Employee faith is in short supply these days, so those chances are\nvirtually nonexistent. Thus it falls to leaders to make sure that they go back\nto the employees (i.e. the people who filled out the survey) and candidly\ncommunicate exactly what strengths and opportunities were discovered in the\nsurvey.\n\nAnd as the question on this online test notes, it\u2019s not just the organization-\nwide results that need to be shared, it\u2019s the results for that particular\ndepartment (or workgroup, business unit, etc.). It\u2019s quite common for a\ncompany to have high engagement scores overall but still have specific areas\nin serious need of improvement. And if we\u2019re unwilling to really dig deep and\ntackle the specific issues facing employees, it\u2019s as though we haven\u2019t any\nresults at all.\n\nWhen you survey employees, you\u2019re essentially making a promise to do something\nabout those issues. If you survey employees about whether they\u2019re getting\nenough opportunities to develop their career, you\u2019re implicitly promising that\nyou will fix that issue. If you survey employees about whether they think the\ncompany\u2019s strategy makes sense, you\u2019re implicitly promising that you will fix\nthat issue.\n\nHere\u2019s the warning: If you survey employees but don\u2019t actually tackle any of\nthe issues that they said need addressing, then you\u2019ve broken a promise to\nthem. And that\u2019s worse, frankly, than not having conducted a survey in the\nfirst place.\n\nWhen the data shows that in 50% of companies either a few of the managers or\nnone of the managers share the area results with their employees, we know that\na lot of companies are breaking their implied promise to employees.\n\nEven the 21% of companies reporting that most of the managers share the area\nresults with their employees are potentially in trouble. Because while there\nare a good number of managers at these companies that share the survey\nresults, ask yourself this question: \u2018Which managers are more likely to share\ntheir results, those with really high engagement scores or those with low\nscores?\u2019\n\nOf course, managers with really high engagement scores are far more likely to\nshare their results with employees than are the managers whose scores were\ndepressingly low. And the problem is that the managers with the lowest scores\nare the ones who really need to courageously sit down with their employees and\ncandidly discuss the root causes of those low scores.\n\nIn the study \u201c[Disengaged Employees Are More Motivated Than You\nThink](https://www.leadershipiq.com/blogs/leadershipiq/disengaged-employees-\nare-more-motivated-than-you-think),\u201d we discovered that 26% of employees are\nMotivated But Unhappy. This means that while they\u2019re motivated to give their\nbest effort at work, they really don\u2019t like their company. And one of the big\nreasons they don\u2019t like their company is that they don\u2019t believe their leader\nencourages and recognizes suggestions for improvement.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that these people have good suggestions for improvement, and\nthey\u2019re probably excited to share them. But if their suggestions are ignored,\ndiminished, or generally unwelcome, their employee engagement will suffer.\nIronically, employee engagement surveys are one of the most direct ways to\nsolicit employees\u2019 suggestions for improvement. And if we don\u2019t even bother to\nclose the loop and report back on the findings of the survey, we\u2019ve very\nblatantly told them \u201cWe will neither encourage nor recognize your suggestions\nfor improvement.\u201d\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/LeadershipIQ) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/leadership-iq/).

We also extended our\nreach in the communities in which we operate. As we integrate the two\nbusinesses, the focus of the combined Group remains the same: to become the\nfinancial services provider of choice for all of our customers and to  \nbuild on OneSavings Bank's long tradition of putting the customer at the heart  \nof everything we do.  \n  \nThe achievements in the year that  \nwe are particularly proud of and which highlight how we are continuously\nimproving our relationships with our key stakeholders include:  \n  \n\\- Customers - consistently high consumer Net Promoter Score for both OSB:\n+66, and CCFS: +72  \n\\- Employees - OSB and CCFS were included in the Sunday Times 100 Best\nCompanies to Work For and OSBIndia certified as a Great Place to Work  \n\\- Communities - donated **\u00a3** 398,000 to community and charitable causes\nacross OSB and CCFS  \n  \n  \n  \nFocused on our customers  \nOneSavings Bank encourages a culture that aims to:  \n  \n\\- communicate and work with each customer on an individual basis  \n\\- act with consistency across all channels  \n\\- promote a confident, open and trustworthy workforce  \n\\- offer simplicity and ease of business  \n\\- offer long-term value for money, and  \n\\- offer transparent products without the use of short-term bonus rates, and\nto offer existing customers the benefit of loyalty rates.  \n  \nOur customers are part of our success and we aim to become a financial\nservices provider of choice. To support this, we use the OSB and CCFS\nestablished governance frameworks for consistent best practice across the\nbusiness and ensure we have combined robust policies and procedures to\nminimise the risk of failure to deliver the service both our savers and our\nborrowers have come to expect.  \n  \nThe main policies which govern how we transact with customers are discussed\nbelow and apply at a Group level. As the integration with CCFS progresses,\nduplicate policies will be replaced by a combined Group-wide policy.  \n  \nLending policy - ensures that the Group lends money responsibly and within the\nBank's lending criteria and risk appetite. The Lending policy is approved\nannually and rolled out to all relevant operational employees to use within\ntheir day-  \nto-day roles. The Lending policy goes through two quality assurance  \nprocesses with both the Operations and the Credit team, with results presented\nto the Group Risk Committee each  \nyear. The performance of our lending and potential risks and changes are\ndiscussed, challenged and approved at Group Credit Committee and Group Risk\nCommittee.\n\nVulnerable Customer and Suicide Awareness policy - sets out the standards and\napproach for the identification and treatment of vulnerable customers and\nprovides guidance to all parts of the Group to ensure vulnerable customers\nconsistently receive fair outcomes.  \n  \nIt ensures that employees are appropriately trained to identify vulnerability\nand potential suicide risks in our customers and put in place appropriate\nactions to deal with such issues as effectively as possible.  \nThe Vulnerable Customer Review Committee continually improves standards and\nensures that policy and outcomes are reported to the Group Risk Committee and\nultimately the Board. The Group is committed to delivering fair and suitable\noutcomes to all customers based on their individual circumstances.\n\nArrears, Repossessions and Forbearance policy - ensures that handling of\narrears and repossessions delivers  \nfair and suitable outcomes tailored  \nto the circumstances of the individual customer. The policy is focused on\nseeking to work proactively with customers to prevent them falling into\narrears, or to cure the arrears position to deliver an appropriate outcome.\nThe Group Risk Committee, a Committee of the Board, is responsible for\nreviewing risk issues and reporting regularly to the Board, which retains\nresponsibility for understanding and controlling  \nthe degree of risk undertaken.  \n  \nEmployees have mandatory annual training on all key policies, with a\ncompletion rate of 99% in 2019.  \n  \nThere are also policies that apply to the business as a whole and govern our\noperations, including:  \n  \n\\- Data Protection and Retention policies to ensure the Group protects its\ncustomer data and manages and retains it fairly and appropriately.  \n\\- Conduct Risk framework, including treating customers fairly to ensure the\nGroup conducts its business fairly and without causing customer detriment.  \n\\- Conflicts of Interest policy to ensure the Group can identify and, if\npossible, avoid conflicts, and where this is not possible, to manage conflicts\nfairly.  \n  \nCustomer engagement  \n  \nWe take a personal approach to our customers, treating each customer as an\nindividual and listening to their needs.  \nMany of our customers are also members of the Kent Reliance Provident Society\n(KRPS), the Society that took over the management of the membership of the\nformer Kent Reliance Building Society. The Bank and the Society have benefited\nfrom member engagement through the online portal launched late in 2015,\nenabling input from a geographically broader range of members. During 2019,\nsix major studies were undertaken, with the 514 members on our KRPS panel\nhelping OSB to identify the areas of our propositions most valuable to\nmembers.  \n  \nCustomer complaints  \n  \nWhilst we concentrate on providing an excellent service, when things go wrong,\nwe aim to put them right and learn from any mistakes made.  \n  \nComplaints Handling policy - ensures that the Group responds to complaints\nswiftly, fairly and consistently and  \nthat customers' concerns are taken seriously. We investigate complaints\ncompetently, diligently and impartially, supported by appropriately trained\nemployees. Through the Operations Committee, management information on\ncomplaints is collected and reported on a regular basis to the  \n  \nBoard and other relevant Committees as appropriate for them to consider if\nadditional actions are required. Root cause analysis is used to identify and\nsolve underlying issues rather than apply quick fixes.  \n  \nFocused on our employees  \nOur employees are our key asset. Their skills, expertise and enthusiasm are\nfundamental to achieving our strategic goals, and throughout 2019  \nwe have continued to invest in training, development and employee engagement\nactivities in order to make OSB an even better place to work.  \n  \nIn the latter part of the year, a central focus was on the Combination with\nCCFS. We strived to ensure a joined-up  \napproach in terms of proactive employee communications in order to ensure that\nour employees in all sites were kept  \nup to date with how the Combination progressed, and that messages were\nconsistent. Employees also had the opportunity to raise questions with the CEO\nanonymously and responses to those questions were published centrally for all\nemployees to view.  \n  \nRecruitment  \n  \nOSB has dedicated Talent Acquisition Teams in place in both the UK and India.\nRecruitment specialists partner with hiring managers in all departments and\nprovide bespoke support in attracting high quality candidates for vacant\npositions and, through robust selection processes, assist them to make strong\nselection decisions.  \n  \nWe advertise vacancies internally on a weekly basis in order to provide career\ndevelopment opportunities for existing employees. In 2019, we filled 22% of UK\nOSB vacancies (47 out of 217), 5% of vacant positions in India (11 of 210) and\n56% of vacancies in CCFS (72 of 127) with internal candidates during the year.  \n  \nA key focus for our Talent Acquisition Teams was again placed on proactively\nidentifying potential candidates directly and through improved use of the OSB\ninternet and external job boards. Our UK Talent Acquisition Team filled 20% of\nroles on a direct recruitment basis, resulting in a saving in excess of **\u00a3**\n280,000 on agency  \nrecruitment fees. Within OSBI, almost 50% of vacancies closed in 2019 were by\nway of direct recruitment activities.  \n  \nWe take a personal approach to our customers, treating each customer as an\nindividual and listening  \nto their needs.  \n  \nWe will expand our Talent Acquisition Team approach within CCFS in 2020, in\norder to ensure that hiring managers in Wolverhampton can utilise local,\ndedicated and specialist recruitment support.  \n  \nOur recruitment procedures are fair and inclusive, with shortlisting,\ninterviewing and selection always carried out without regard to gender\nreassignment, sexual orientation, marital or civil partnership status, colour,\nrace, caste, nationality, ethnic or national origin, religion or belief, age,\npregnancy or maternity leave or trade union membership.  \n  \nNo candidate with a disability is excluded unless it is clear that the\ncandidate is unable to perform a duty that is intrinsic to the role, having\ntaken into account reasonable adjustments. Reasonable adjustments to the\nrecruitment process are made to ensure that no applicant  \nis disadvantaged because of their disability and questions asked during the\nprocess are not discriminatory  \nor unnecessarily intrusive.  \n  \nIn 2019, OSB welcomed 156 new UK employees with a further 142 joining\nOSBIndia. CCFS saw 128 new employees, which at the end of the year resulted in\nour Group-wide employee base expanding to a total of 1,834.  \n  \nBoth CCFS and OSB operate successful referral schemes with CCFS' Recommend a\nFriend Scheme resulting in the recruitment of 12 new employees in 2019. Within\nOSB, 22 vacant UK positions were filled during the year as a result  \nof the Employee Referral Scheme, with a further 32 vacancies filled as a\nresult  \nof the Employee Referral Scheme in OSBI.  \n  \nTraining and development  \n  \n  \nThe OSB People Development Team, based in both the UK and India, concentrates  \non providing learning and development opportunities for all employees, using  \na mix of internal and externally-sourced content, which are delivered through  \na range of media, including workshop and digital formats.  \n  \nA key focus throughout 2019 was the implementation of OSB's Fit to Practice\nScheme, which requires line managers to play a more proactive role in  \nidentifying development needs, providing developmental feedback and\nestablishing appropriate activities to continually progress competence levels\nof their  \ndirect reports.  \n  \nWithin CCFS, the approach regarding training and competence requirements is\nmanaged on a departmental basis and, as such, there is an opportunity for us\nto establish a consistent and Group-wide approach throughout 2020.  \n  \nIn 2019, we provided a wide range of workshops, including bespoke  \nmanagement development programmes, regulatory training and business change\ncontent to support operational and systemic training needs. There were 354\nseparate workshops or learning events delivered by the People Development Team\nin the UK and over 100 other separate learning events attended by OSB staff\nthat were either delivered at external events or delivered internally  \nby external training providers.  \n  \nWithin OSBI, we concentrate on making all those who join the Group feel as\nwelcome as possible. We provide as much training as necessary to enable\nemployees to perform to their best ability. In 2019, new employees were\nprovided with an average of 108 hours of training before starting their role\nand in addition to this, there was significant focus placed on establishing\nconsistency with workshops and content that is being delivered by the UK\nPeople Development Team. During 2019, we delivered 187 workshops at OSBI.  \n  \nDuring 2019, the Learning and Development Team at CCFS increased the amount of\ntraining they deliver, with  \nthe number of learning hours per full time employee increasing from 40 in 2018\nto 45 in 2019. Over 200 sessions were run  \nby the CCFS team.  \n  \nOSB saw 99% of monthly mandatory regulatory training completed within the\nmonthly deadlines, which shows the importance we place on ensuring that our\nemployees are suitably aware of key requirements. Mandatory training  \nis similarly taken seriously at CCFS, where 98.6% of all training was\ncompleted by the end of 2019.  \n  \nThe Group is also committed to supporting employees undertaking professional\ndevelopment and, in 2019, 19 OSB employees received financial support  \nto pursue professional qualifications, with a further six being financially\nsupported by CCFS.  \n  \nUnder OSB's UK Apprenticeship Scheme, at the end of 2019, we had six\napprentices working within a number of different functions throughout the\nbusiness.  \nWith each individual apprenticeship arrangement running for two years, we\nremain positive that this will lead to a number of permanent appointments and\nongoing careers within the Group.  \n  \nRetention and progression  \n  \nThe Group has a genuine desire to retain, support and develop its employee\nbase. During 2019, 87 UK OSB employees, 43 employees in OSBI and 76 CCFS\nemployees were formally promoted to a more senior grade.  \n  \nOur Group-wide regretted attrition rate for 2019 was 11%, made up of an OSB UK\nrate of 10%, a rate of 7% in CCFS and 16% in OSBI, all below industry\naverages. In addition to this, we achieved a low rate of non-regretted\nattrition, which  \non a Group-wide basis was 5%.  \n  \nIn 2019, OSB again identified Primary Talent Groups in both the UK and India,\nwhich were provided a range of talent management activities, in order to aid\ntheir ongoing progression. Activities included: access to a Board, Executive\nor senior mentor, career development interviews, psychometric profiling and\nrelated coaching and bespoke off-site  \ngroup leadership workshops delivered via an external Business School or\nspecialist. The Group considers this initiative as an integral part of\nretaining and developing our emerging talent, either as technical specialists\nor as potential leaders of  \nthe future.  \n  \nWithin CCFS, the approach to talent management in 2019 saw a continued focus\non future leadership through  \nits Aspiring and New Line Manager programmes. The first is aimed at staff\nmembers who aspire to become a manager in the near future, and was designed to\nallow the employee to deepen their understanding of the  \nknowledge, skills and attitude required in a managerial or supervisory role.\nThe second programme is for new line managers  \nand was developed to equip CCFS line managers and supervisors with the tools\nto develop and grow their leadership and management capabilities. It consists\nof ten core modules, which make up the essential elements of the programme,\nwith an optional nine modules which can be completed thereafter.  \n  \nRemuneration and benefits  \n  \nWe believe in rewarding our employees fairly and transparently, enabling them\nto share in the success of the business.  \nDetails of the Group's remuneration policies can be found in the Remuneration\nReport on page 131.  \n  \nWe offer our employees a comprehensive range of benefits, and continue to\nreview these to ensure they are in line with market practice.  \n  \nWhilst there are some differences within the standard benefits packages\nprovided by OSB and CCFS, we will be undertaking a detailed Group-wide review\nduring 2020 in order to establish how these approaches can be harmonised.  \n  \nIn 2019, key additions to OSB benefits included the provision of a fully-\nfunded Medical Cash Plan for all employees and the opportunity to sacrifice\npart of annual bonuses directly into the pension plan.  \n  \nEnhancements made during 2019 to the CCFS benefits package included the\nintroduction of flexible and voluntary benefits which included the following:  \nHealth Cash Plan, Health Screening, Cycle to Work Scheme, Car Leasing Scheme,\nHoliday Trading Scheme and a Retail, Health and Wellbeing Discount Scheme.  \n  \nWe also encourage our employees  \nto hold shares in the Bank for the long term, via an annual ShareSave Scheme.\nThese schemes are open to all UK-based employees and allow them to save a\nfixed amount of between **\u00a3** 5 and **\u00a3** 500 per month over either three or\nfive years in order to use these savings at the end of the qualifying period\nto buy OSB shares at a fixed option price. At the current time, around 58% of\nOSB employees and 68% of CCFS employees are members of one of our ShareSave\nSchemes.  \n  \nRedundancy and redeployment  \n  \nThere is a Group-wide Redundancy and Redeployment policy designed to ensure\nthat, ahead of any potential redundancy, we take all reasonable steps to\nidentify feasible alternatives that meet the needs of the business. If a\nredundancy situation is unavoidable, employees would be given maximum warning\npossible, support to seek alternative positions, priority for retraining,\ncounselling if required and support to seek alternative employment. The Board\nhas safeguarded the existing contractual and statutory rights of OSB and CCFS\nemployees and for a period following completion of the Combination, the Group\namended redundancy policies to provide enhanced payments.  \n  \nWe believe in rewarding our employees fairly and transparently, enabling them\nto share in the success of the business.  \n  \nEmployee engagement and culture  \n  \n  \nIn October 2019, for the fifth consecutive year, OSB's UK employees were\ninvited  \nto participate in the Sunday Times Best Companies to Work For employee\nengagement survey, and almost 90% of employees submitted a response.  \n  \nWe achieved an overall score increase of 2.3% and, for the first time, OSB\nachieved a Two Star Accreditation Rating, signifying outstanding levels of\nworkplace engagement. The continuous improvement in employee engagement saw\nOSB included within The Sunday Times 100 Best Companies to Work For list for\nthe second time. The improved  \nresults were primarily achieved as a result of the creation and implementation\nof Culture and Engagement Plans within  \nall departments and the broader identification and implementation of\ninitiatives by the Engagement Steering Group.  \n  \n  \nWhilst CCFS did not participate in the Best Companies to Work For survey as a\nresult of the Combination, it was placed in the Top 20 of the Sunday Times\nBest Companies to Work For list of 2019, the fourth consecutive year that CCFS\nachieved Top 20 status.  \n  \nOur participation in the next Best Companies to Work For survey will be on a\nGroup-wide basis, including all UK employees within both OSB and CCFS.  \n  \nIn June 2019, OSB employees in both the UK and India also took part in the\nannual Banking Standards Board survey for the third consecutive year, which\naims to influence positive change throughout the banking sector. This saw\nanother extremely high overall participation  \nrate of 76% and provided an insight into employees' perceptions of the\napplication of the Group's values, potential barriers to challenge and to\nspeak up along with their observations of unethical or inappropriate\nbehaviour. The results showed an increase in the majority of the nine separate\nsurvey categories, with the average category score increasing by 1.4% compared\nwith the 2018 results, giving OSB an average ranking of 14 out of the 29 banks\nwho participated in the survey. When the  \n2020 Banking Standards Board Survey is undertaken, we will also be inviting\nall CCFS employees to participate for the first time.  \n  \nOSBI participates in a separate employee engagement survey, run by the Great\nPlace to Work Institute, and has been officially certified as a Great Place to\nWork for the third year in succession, with strong results in all five survey\ncategories (credibility of management, respect for people, fairness at the\nworkplace, pride and camaraderie between people). The highest score related to\nthe Pride category, reflecting the strong brand and culture that exists\nthroughout the teams in Bangalore.  \n  \nIn 2018, OSB partnered with specialist external consultants to design and\nlaunch the Group's Mission, Vision, Values and the supporting behaviours and\nin 2019 we focused on embedding these throughout the business, and weaving\nthem into  \nour cultural DNA through an ongoing programme of related communications and\npulse surveys.  \n  \nOSB's four values (Stronger Together, Aim High, Take Ownership and Create Your\nFuture) were implemented into Group- wide processes, including goal setting,\nappraisals, and interview and selection. To support this further, around 80\nsenior managers and the same number of line managers attended workshops\nfocusing on truly embedding our values and progressing towards the achievement  \nof our Mission and Vision. In addition, we launched a separate and extensive\nprogramme of communications to introduce all staff to our different types of\ncustomers, who are at the heart of our Mission and Vision statements.  \n  \nOur proactive approach in driving organisation culture and the associated\nefforts in the design of our Mission, Vision, Values and supporting behaviours\nsaw OSB listed as finalists at the 2019 Business Culture Awards in two\nseparate categories:  \n(a) Best Employer Brand and Values Initiative for Business Culture and (b)\nBest Medium-Sized Organisation for Business Culture. We were delighted that\nour work in the design and implementation of our Mission, Vision and Values\nwas further recognised at the Business Culture Awards ceremony when we\nachieved the runner- up award in both categories.  \n  \nCCFS has five established principles that act as organisational values\n(Respect, Excellence, Attention, Challenge and Honesty) which are already\nembedded within its performance appraisal processes. A key challenge for 2020  \nwill relate to establishing a harmonised approach to Mission, Vision and\nValues that will enable us to further build on the cultural progression that\nhas been achieved to date in both OSB and CCFS.  \n  \n2019 also saw the inception of OSB's Workforce Advisory Forum (OneVoice),\nwhich aims to improve the level of engagement that OSB's Board has with the\nwider workforce. In addition to rotating Non-Executive Directors and Group\nExecutive Committee members, the forum is attended by employees who have\nnominated themselves to represent the employees within their respective\ndepartment or office location.  \n  \nWithin CCFS, the Employee Representative Committee, which met four times in\n2019, includes representatives from all parts of the business who meet with\nsenior management teams to raise any concerns they may have and provide input.  \n  \nThe Group operates a Whistleblowing policy, championed by the Chair of the\nGroup Audit Committee. We encourage employees to feel confident in raising\nserious concerns at the earliest opportunity, and provide avenues to raise\nconcerns confidentially, protected from possible reprisals. Regular reports\nare provided to the Group Audit Committee, including an annual report, which\nis also presented to the Board.  \n  \nEmployee recognition and awards  \n  \n  \nIn 2019, OSB recognised the significant tenure of 51 employees who reached a\nfive, ten, 15 or 20-year milestone of employment with the Group via our Long\nService Award programme. There were two employees who reached 20 years'\nservice and our longest-serving employee now has over 32 years' service. CCFS\ncommenced trading in 2008 and in 2019 was able to provide 10 Year Service\nAwards to eight employees and 5 Year Service Awards to a further 53\nindividuals.  \n  \nEvery quarter, OSB employees are invited to nominate their colleagues as part\nof our OneTeam Award programme, which aligns with OSB's four values.\nThroughout 2019, we received over 400 nominations from which 29 individuals\nand teams were awarded. CCFS continues to recognise those employees who\nconsistently demonstrate our values and behaviours and two employees each\nquarter are recognised as Charter Champions.  \nThe expertise of our employees was also acknowledged within the mortgage\nindustry during 2019 with Alison Drysdale winning Underwriter of the Year at\nthe British Specialist Lending Awards.  \n  \nHealth and safety  \n  \n  \nThe Board recognises the importance of health and safety and takes\nresponsibility for it within the Group. We have a duty  \nof care to all of our employees and customers, and a safe and healthy work\nenvironment is paramount. We are committed to fostering and maintaining a\nworking environment in which our  \nemployees can flourish, and our customers can safely transact with us. We\noperate a Health and Safety policy and we review our employee and customer\nenvironment regularly.  \n  \nAnnual mandatory health and safety training is completed by all Group\nemployees. In 2019, we undertook a full review of OSB's real estate. The\nreview demonstrated that all sites are compliant with statutory health and\nsafety regulations and provided us with additional best practice improvements\nand recommendations which will be implemented in the future.  \n  \nDiversity and inclusion  \n  \n  \nWe recognise the benefits that diversity of our people brings to the business\nand we actively promote and encourage a culture and environment which values\nand celebrates our differences. In 2019, we continued our journey to become a\ntruly diverse and inclusive organisation, which is committed to providing\nequal opportunities through the recruitment, training and development of our\nemployees.  \n  \nThe commitment to actively promote an environment where disabled candidates\nand employees are welcomed was again an area of focus. In line with OSB's\nDisability Confident Employer (Level Two)  \nstatus, we are proud to have a number of employees who are registered as\ndisabled.  \n  \nCCFS has already achieved Disability Confident Committed status and we'll be\nworking towards increasing this to Level Two status in the future.  \n  \nCCFS is a signatory of the MIND Pledge to Change and we are committed to\nreducing the stigma of mental health within the workplace. All CCFS managers\nundergo training aimed at preventing discrimination and promoting good mental\nhealth throughout our business.  \nThis training programme is delivered with the support of Mental Health First\nAid England and the programme is accredited by the Royal Society for Public\nHealth.  \n  \nWithin OSB, there has been a significant focus on supporting mental health via\nthe provision of Mindfulness Workshops which were delivered in a number of\ndifferent office locations throughout the year.  \n  \nCCFS' Wolverhampton offices are in the heart of the West Midlands and boast a\nrichly diverse local community that is reflected in the diversity of our\npeople. As a Group, we value and celebrate diversity by hosting theme days on  \nkey festival dates such as Eid, Diwali, Vaisakhi and Easter.  \n  \nOSB published its 2019 Gender Pay Gap Report in line with legislation that\napplies to all UK companies with more than 250 employees. The full publication\nis available on the Group's website: www.osb.co.uk.  \n  \nOSB's median gender pay gap as at the snapshot date of 5 April 2019 was 37.6%,\nwith the mean gap at 43.1%, these figures reduced from the 2018 reported\nfigures  \nof 44.0% and 45.5%, respectively.  \n  \nCCFS' median gender pay gap as at the snapshot date of 5 April 2019 was 17.8%,\nwith the mean gap at 49.8%, these figures reduced from the 2018 reported\nfigures  \nof 19.5% and 52.2% respectively.  \n  \nWhilst it is pleasing to see progression across the Group, we are committed to\nreducing these gaps further.  \nFundamentally, in both OSB and CCFS, the gaps relate to the structure of our\nworkforce and reflect the fact that we have more men than women in senior\nroles and more female employees undertaking clerical roles. Progress has been\nmade to positively impact both aspects of our workforce structure, and we\nremain confident that our gaps will continue to close.  \n  \nWe recognise that we need to focus on improving our gender balance and have\nmade solid progress towards the commitments that OSB and CCFS have made as\nsignatories of HM Treasury's Women in Finance Charter. Both OSB  \nand CCFS committed to a target of 30% of senior management positions being\nundertaken by female employees, with OSB's target date being the end of 2020\nand CCFS by the end of 2022.  \n  \nSolid progress was made towards these commitments throughout 2019, with OSB\nincreasing from 28% at the end of 2018 and closing the year on 31%.  \n  \nIn 2020 we will be reporting our Women  \nin Finance Charter progress on a joint basis, maintaining an overall target of\n30% by the end of 2020, at which point a new ongoing target will be\nestablished.  \n  \nIn 2019, OSB's Women's Networking Forum, which is focused on helping to\nidentify and break down the barriers that prevent women from progressing\nwithin financial services, continued to  \ndevelop both its membership and range of activities. It provided regular\nopportunities for individuals to participate in relevant discussions, listen\nto and engage with guest speakers and undertake bespoke development activities\nto support and encourage career progression.  \n  \nCCFS formed a Diversity and Inclusion Working Group in July 2019, comprised of\n14 members, who introduced themselves to the business during National\nInclusion Week. To date, they have coordinated  \na mental health quiz, undertaken sign language sessions and engaged with a\nlocal charity to deliver a thought-provoking training session, challenging\nmanagers  \nto think how fair are they?.  \n  \nCCFS is also engaged with Stonewall and became a diversity champion employer,\nensuring that we do even more to ensure that our LGBT employees (and future\nhires) recognise CCFS as an inclusive employer of choice. Additionally, CCFS\nbecame a member of The Employers Network  \nfor Equality & Inclusion (ENEI), the UK's leading employer network covering\nall aspects of equality and inclusion issues in the workplace.  \n  \nAt the end of 2019, over 56% of our UK OSB workforce was female, as was 59% of\nthe CCFS employee base, and within OSBIndia females constitute 41% of all\nstaff.  \nCurrently, 15% of our Group Executive Committee and 45% of our Board are\nfemale, placing us 12th in the Financial Services Sector of the November 2019\nHampton-Alexander Review of the FTSE 250.  \n  \nWe have both Flexible Working and Homeworking policies in place to provide\nincreased support to our staff who have parental and/or carer\nresponsibilities.  \nWithin CCFS, we have around 18% of employees working under a formal flexible\nworking arrangement relating to reduced or compressed working hours. Within  \nOSB, around 10% of our UK employees work part-time hours with a further 11\nindividuals working a compressed working week.\n\n|  Male |  Female  \n---|---|---  \nNumber of Board Directors |  \n  \n9 |  \n  \n5  \nNumber of Directors of subsidiaries |  \n  \n19 |  \n  \n3  \nNumber of senior managers (not Directors) |  \n  \n  \n  \n98 |  \n  \n  \n  \n44  \nAll other employees1 |  763 |  929  \n  \n1\\. Includes OSB, OSBI and CCFS  \n  \nAt the end of 2019, over 56% of our UK OSB workforce was female, as was 59% of\nthe CCFS employee base, and within OSBIndia females constitute 41% of all\nstaff.  \n  \nHuman rights  \n  \n  \nWe want each member of our workforce and other stakeholders to be treated with\ndignity and respect. OSB endorses the UN Declaration of Human Rights and\nsupports the UN Guiding Principles of Business  \nand Human Rights. The Group adheres to the International Labour Organisation\nFundamental Conventions. We seek to engage with stakeholders with fairness,\ndignity and respect. The Group does not tolerate child labour or forced\nlabour. OSB respects freedom of association and the rights of employees to be\nrepresented  \nby trade unions or works councils. The Group is a fair employer and does not\ndiscriminate on the basis of gender, religion, age, caste, disability or\nethnicity. Our policy applies throughout the Group and is communicated to our\nemployees during induction training.  \n  \nThe Group's third annual statement under the Modern Slavery Act 2015 was\npublished on our website in June 2019. Over the year, no instances of modern\nslavery were reported and we continue  \nto ensure all relevant employment policies have direct consideration to the\nrisk of modern slavery. These policies include Recruitment and Selection and\nDiversity and Inclusion.  \n  \nCCFS has zero tolerance for slavery and human trafficking and, in line with\nthe Modern Slavery Act 2015, takes active steps to identify and combat slavery\nand human trafficking in its business  \nand supply chains. In 2019, CCFS continued work to identify and assess\npotential risk areas in its supply chains, grading the risks as high or low\nbased on criteria and factors we have determined to be relevant in the\nassessment of the risks. Enhanced due diligence is undertaken on suppliers\nconsidered to be high risk and anti-modern slavery provisions are incorporated\ninto our contracts with suppliers.  \n  \nOSB and CCFS have an Anti-Bribery policy, reviewed annually and approved by\nthe Group Audit Committee. It will not accept or condone any behaviour\nconnected with accepting, requesting or offering any bribe or inducement in\nreturn for providing  \na favour.  \n  \nOSB and CCFS do not consider themselves to be at a high risk of bribery; they\nconduct all of their business in the UK and the  \nonly significant outsourcing arrangement is with a wholly-owned subsidiary of\na UK Building Society in relation to CCFS' deposit-taking business.  \n  \nIn relation to the procurement of goods and services, the Anti-Bribery policy\noperates in conjunction with a number of other Group policies which are\nincorporated into the Conflicts of Interest policy, Modern Slavery Act\nStatement, and Vendor Management and Outsourcing policy.  \n  \nAll staff are required to complete an Anti-Bribery and Corruption Compliance\nTraining module on induction and every other year afterwards. On an annual\nbasis all staff have to acknowledge that  \nthey have read the Employee Handbook, which reminds them of the need to comply\nwith the Anti-Bribery policy.  \n  \nIf an employee suspects that the Policy is being violated, they are required\nto immediately report this in accordance with the Group's Internal Fraud\npolicy and Response Plan or the Financial  \nCrime reporting procedure as appropriate.  \nThe Group's Whistleblowing policy and procedure is also available as an\nalternative reporting process, if for  \nwhatever reason, it is felt that the other procedures above are not\nappropriate.  \n  \nOSBIndia  \n  \n  \nOSBIndia is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. OSBI operates from an\noffice in Bangalore and employs 490 employees, of which 41% are female. OSBI\nsupports the Bank across various functions including Support Services,\nOperations, IT, Finance and Human Resources. We actively promote integration\nbetween our colleagues in the UK and India with frequent employee exchanges,\ntransfers, overseas training, staff and management visits.  \n  \nAs part of the Group, OSBI falls under the same Group policies that are in\nforce in the UK offices, most importantly, Equal Opportunities, Non-\ndiscrimination and Harassment, Whistleblowing, Information Security and Clear\nDesk policies. There are only very slight differences in the Group's main HR\npolicies due to local legislation.  \n  \nOSBI is a holder of ISO 27001: 2013 certified, which demonstrates high\nstandards of information security. To that end, the business continuity site\nin Hyderabad was opened and became fully operational in 2017. OSBI prides\nitself on excellence in customer service and the ISO 9001: 2015 certified is a\ntestament to meeting customer and regulatory requirements by providing\noutstanding customer service.  \n  \nIn compliance with the Modern Slavery Act, we do not support excessive\novertime and our employees in India are encouraged to work in accordance with\nlocal legislation. Employees in our  \nBangalore office enjoy a range of benefits which include 22 days of annual\nleave, 12 days' sick leave and cafeteria services.  \n  \n  \nFocused on the environment  \nOSB's Environmental policy states that we are committed to reducing our\nenvironmental impact and to continually improve our environmental performance  \nas an integral part of our business strategy. This policy ensures that we meet\nor exceed all relevant environmental obligations under law and regulation.  \n  \nThe Environmental policy is under review to include additional risk\nassessments and develop actions and measures to include the impact of\nenvironmental change on the Group's business activities, in addition to\nfocusing on our impact  \non the environment.  \n  \n2019 was yet another year when the Group took on initiatives, or advanced\nexisting ones, to achieve its goal of becoming a greener organisation.  \nOSB Greenhouse gas emissions  \n  \nThe Group is committed to promoting awareness of environmental issues amongst\nour employees. In 2019, OSB was successful in reducing single use plastic\nconsumption by taking away unnecessary bins and installing large recycling\nstations across the estate. We now have a Green Committee, made up of\nvolunteers,  \nour Green Ninjas, who actively support the policy.  \n  \nOSB is active in attempting to reduce its carbon footprint and, in 2019, it\nintroduced two electric vans which the Maintenance team use to travel between\nsites. Electric charging points are now also available for employees to use,\nencouraging the use  \nof electric vehicles.  \n  \nCCFS operates an environmental management system that is certified to the\ninternationally recognised ISO 14001 standard. This not only supports legal\ncompliance but provides a framework for ongoing improvements.  \n  \nIn 2019, further progress was made on tackling CCFS' carbon footprint (see  \nGreenhouse gas emissions). This included undertaking an ESOS energy\nassessment, introducing a Cycle to Work scheme  \nand providing support for employees to choose ultra-low emissions vehicles.\nImprovements were also made to waste management and recycling by introducing\nreusable cups, enhancing segregation of waste and introducing  \nbattery recycling. Employee engagement has been key, and CCFS rolled out\nonline environmental awareness training, plus various communications and\nactivities throughout the year, led by its enthusiastic Environmental\nCommittee.  \n  \nAcross the Group, we have high-level environmental objectives to:  \n  \n\\- Accept responsibility for contributing to the protection of the environment\nand strive to ensure that our actions will not detract from the long-term\nsustainability of environmental resources  \n\\- Minimise harmful emissions  \n\\- Promote advantageous environmental practices by all staff  \n\\- Consult with suppliers to improve the environmental impact of goods and\nservices provided to the Group  \n  \n  \nOSB Greenhouse gas emissions  \n  \n\n****  \n  \nEmission source |  **2019**  \n **Tonnes CO** **2** **e** |  2018  \nTonnes CO2e  \n---|---|---  \nCombustion of fuel |  **89** |  76  \nOperation of facilities |  **3** |  5  \nPurchased electricity |  **884** |  951  \nTotal greenhouse gas emissions |  **976** |  1,032  \nTotal emissions per employee |  **0.88** |  1.04  \n  \nCCFS Greenhouse gas emissions\n\n****  \n  \nEmission source |  **2019**  \n **Tonnes CO** **2** **e** |  2018  \nTonnes CO2e  \n---|---|---  \nCombustion of fuel |  **213** |  158  \nOperation of facilities |  **3** |  3  \nPurchased electricity |  **201** |  273  \nTotal greenhouse gas emissions |  **417** |  434  \nTotal emissions per employee |  **0.61** |  0.68  \nPurchase of renewable energy |  **(50.4)** |  n/a  \nTotal net GHG emissions |  **366.6** |  n/a  \nNet emissions per employee |  **0.54** |  n/a  \n  \n  \n\nFuel type |  Emissions conversion factor source  \n---|---  \nUK electricity \u2013 location based (excluding transmission and distribution), UK\ngas, diesel, R134-a, R32 and R22 F-gas |  Department for Environment, Food and\nRural Affairs 2019\u201320  \nOverseas electricity |  [http://www.carbon-\ncalculator.org.uk/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=dSLgoPNMDeXBoRZ3fjHRXQ3-g9Sd9OCkbpDc5xE4PLBf3pHZ88Q7MNIQip8KOvAkpQeCq6ihpP5ThGWEvxuwef70IpdJjhiD8ur2KnEqroXmlvSKHvAnEySKWQYHUogZ)  \n  \n  \nMandatory greenhouse gas report  \nReporting scope  \n\\- Our methodology has been based on the principles of the Greenhouse Gas\nProtocol, taking account of the 2015 amendment which sets out a dual reporting\nmethodology for the reporting of Scope 2 emissions. This means that UK\nelectricity is reported using two methods.  \n\\- We have reported on all the measured emissions sources required under The\nCompanies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors' Report) Regulations 2013,\nexcept where stated.  \n\\- The period of our report is 01/01/2019 - 31/12/2019.  \n\\- This includes emissions under Scope 1 and 2, except where stated, but\nexcludes any emissions from Scope 3.  \n\\- Conversion factors for UK electricity (location-based methodology), gas and\nother emissions are those published by the Department for Environment, Food\nand Rural Affairs for 2019/20.  \n\\- Conversion factors for UK electricity (market-based methodology) have been\nset as 0, due to the 100% renewable electricity tariffs which were in place\nthroughout the 2019 year.  \n\\- The market-based methodology has only been applied to UK electricity\nsupplies.  \n\\- Conversion factors for overseas electricity have been provided by the\nGovernment of India, taken from 2018.  \n\\- Conversion factors for overseas (India only) diesel usage are those\npublished by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for\n2019/20.  \n\\- Conversion factors used for the reporting of F-Gases R22, R32 and R134-a\nare those published by the  \nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for 2019/20.  \n\\- The following emission IDs have been retired and are not included within\nthe 2019 report:  \nPrestige Finance - gas meters 2978102004 (OSB-INV-04189-10-07- NAT-004) and\n2978102105 (OSB- INV-04189-10-07-NAT-105) have  \nbeen disconnected and replaced by new gas meter (OSB-04189-10-07- GAS-104).  \nMaidstone - site closed in November 2017. Emission ID for electricity (OSB-\nINV-04189-10-05-ELE-841) retired.  \n  \n\\- The following sites have been added to the portfolio during the 2019\nreporting year: 30 Watersmeet and 51 Watersmeet.  \n\\- There has been a significant reduction in F-Gas recharges between 2018  \nand 2019 as no F-Gas recharges were required for any of the UK sites.  \n\\- There has been an increase in combustion, due primarily to the estimation\napplied to the Prestige site as no gas data was available for  \nthe 2019 year, therefore benchmarking estimation based on office type and\nfloor area has been applied (using TM46 benchmarks).  \n\\- There has been a reduction in emissions relating to purchased energy\n(electricity) which is due in large part to the lower 2019 carbon factor for\nlocation-based grid electricity, as electricity usage increased in 2019 to  \n2,314.5 MWh (from 2,180 MWh in 2018).  \n  \nStatement of exclusions  \n  \n  \n\\- Global diesel/petrol use (for vehicles) has been excluded from the report\non the basis that data is not available  \nfor reporting. This is due to be reviewed for inclusion in future years.  \n\\- It has been confirmed that there is no LPG use within the estate, either in\nthe UK or overseas.  \n\\- It has been confirmed that there is no mains gas supply in relation to the\nIndia operations.  \n\\- Two UK sites, Interbay and Fleet, continue to be excluded from reporting as\nthese are managed rented properties with energy charged as a flat rate as part\nof a service charge and are therefore excluded on the basis of the financial\ncontrol approach. Heritable  \nat Newman Street is a landlord site, but as data was available for reporting\nin the 2018 year, this data has been used as a direct comparison estimation\nfor 2019 to ensure consistency.  \n  \n  \nFocused on our communities  \nWe have a strong tradition of caring about our local communities. Each year,\nOSB engages with people across the UK and India, by taking part in a variety\nof charitable events and partnerships.  \n  \nIn 2019, the Group, including CCFS pre- Combination donations, raised **\u00a3**\n398,000 for its charity partners and our employees also volunteered their time\nto support a variety of community-based activities. OSBI is also heavily\nengaged within its local community in Bangalore through participation in  \n  \n  \n2019 marked the beginning of a new partnership with our current national\ncharity partner, My Shining Star, Children's Cancer Charity, as well as the\nintroduction of local charity partners for each of our brands. By partnering\nwith national and local charities, we can offer employees the chance to make a\ndifference, both nationwide and closer to home. By focusing our efforts on our\nnominated  \ncharities, we can make a more meaningful impact to the lives of those that the\ncharities support.  \n  \nThroughout the year, we continued to enable employees to have an impact  \n  \n  \nThe OSB Community Fund  \n  \n  \nAs well as encouraging fundraising  \nand volunteering, we also offer financial support for causes close to our\nemployees' hearts through our Community Fund initiative. Any employee can\napply for funding on behalf of a registered charity or community project that\nthey are actively involved with. A total of 34 applications were made in 2019,\nand we are hoping for even more in 2020, as the popularity of the scheme\ngrows. The initiative, since being piloted successfully in OSB's UK offices,  \nhas also now been introduced in India.  \n  \nOur national charity partner  \n  \ncharitable causes and programmes  \n  \non the charities that matter to them,  \n  \nthat require critical assistance.  \n  \nGiving something back  \n  \n  \nWe are proud of our strong links with our local community, especially through\nthe Kent Reliance brand, which has been synonymous with the county for over  \n150 years. As our employee numbers have grown, so has our commitment to give\nsomething back to our local communities.  \n  \nOur community strategy is built primarily around three key pillars consisting\nof Volunteering, Fundraising and Community Investment, which provide a\nplatform  \nfor OSB to live its vision and values.  \n  \nby encouraging an active hands on approach, through fundraising and\nvolunteering opportunities. More employees than ever before used their Day to\nMake a Difference this year; this is a paid day to help support any registered\ncharity or community group.  \nThis is often linked to one of our local charity partners, for example our\nannual community-based campaign, Project Kent, that Kent Reliance runs\nalongside KMFM, or something close to the hearts of our employees.\nFurthermore, if employees choose to undertake additional fundraising\nactivities, the Bank will match any funds raised up to a specific amount.  \n  \nMy Shining Star: Children's Cancer Charity  \nMy Shining Star is a charity that supports families through the financial\nhardship associated with childhood cancer. Around 1,600 children are diagnosed\nwith cancer in the UK every year.  \n  \nFamilies spend an extra **\u00a3** 600 per month, on average, during their child's\ncancer treatment (mainly for transport, food and accommodation) and many fall\ninto debt as a result, or families become separated as siblings of the child\nare left at home.  \n  \nThe money we have raised throughout 2019 has gone directly to improving the\nlives of families in their darkest times.  \n  \n  \nOur local charity partners  \n  \n  \nEach of our locations supports our national charity partner by taking part in\nGroup- wide fundraisers, but we also encourage our employees to support a\ncharity on their doorstep. By engaging with charity champions at each\nlocation, we are able to ensure the views of each location are represented\nwhen a local charity partner was agreed. Our charity champions  \nhave been instrumental in supporting our Giving Something Back initiative and\nhave organised a number of fundraisers in support of our national and local\ncharity partners.  \n  \nDemelza Hospice Care for Children supported by Kent Reliance  \nKent Reliance branches continue to support Demelza as their local charity\npartner, fundraising in branches and offering customers the dedicated Demelza\nChildren's Account, whereby the charity receives an annual donation equivalent  \nto an agreed percentage of the combined funds held across the associated\naccounts at the end of the year.  \n  \nBreast Cancer Haven, Wessex supported by InterBay Commercial Breast Cancer\nHaven is a centre in Titchfield, Hampshire. The charity provides free support\nand advice for those affected by breast cancer and their families, in a\nrelaxing, non-clinical environment. This year, the team has raised money for\nBreast Cancer Haven through a variety  \nof fundraisers, including a sponsored fire-walk, tea party events, a summer\nfestival and skydives.  \n  \nAge UK Hertfordshire supported by Prestige Finance  \nAge UK Hertfordshire works tirelessly to help improve the lives of thousands\nof the elder generation. It is one of the largest charities providing services\nto the elderly in Hertfordshire, providing vital support for many people in\nneed of later life care. Not only have the team been fundraising with events\nlike their Easter charity bake sale, they've been getting hands on and\nvolunteering in the local care home and taking part in a Strictly Come Dancing\nthemed event.  \n  \nShooting Star Children's Hospices supported by InterBay Asset Finance Shooting\nStar Children's Hospices supports 700 life-limited babies, children and young\npeople living in London and Surrey, and their families. Bespoke support is\navailable 365 days a year at their two purpose-built children's hospices, as\nwell as in families' own homes at no cost to them. As our newest local charity\npartner, joining us  \nin October, OSB employees have already helped Shooting Star to move items from\nits old warehouse, to a new fit-for- purpose facility, so they can store more\nequipment to help more people.  \n  \nOSBI fundraising  \n  \n  \nCorporate social responsibility is extremely important to OSBI. The concept of\nhelping society is embedded in its corporate governance structure through its\nCorporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Policy and also through employee\nengagement.  \n  \nAs part of the OSBI CSR Policy, funds are kept aside each year to spend on\nsocial causes. This is governed by a CSR Committee and implemented by the  \nCorporate and Social Responsibility Group. The focus is to help and contribute\nin areas where there is critical need and within  \nthe office locality so they are also able to contribute their time.  \n  \nIn 2019, the CSR Group continued to support the areas of child welfare,\neducation and healthcare.  \n  \nChild welfare and education  \nOSBI has partnered with SOS Children's Village, located in Bangalore, to fund\neducation, food, clothing and housing for 20 orphans. Working together with\nSOS, OSBI employees helped to provide support for the holistic development of\norphans and women and children belonging to vulnerable families. OSBI also\nhosted some events at SOS for employees to spend time with the children, which\nwas highly appreciated by both the children and employees.  \n  \nHealthcare  \nOSBI is currently supporting HBS Hospital to provide dialysis sessions to 40\nindividuals who live below the poverty line. OSBI has also contributed two\ndialysis machines which can provide over 11,000 dialysis sessions over a\nperiod of five years. HBS Hospital is a non-profit hospital which provides\ncritical healthcare to members  \nof society who could otherwise not afford the care they need.  \n  \nOSBI also continued to support maintaining the gardens at CV Raman General\nHospital for the second year. Hospital workers and patients have appreciated\nthe positive impact such a space has had on patients, their relatives and the\nhospital staff.  \n  \nCCFS and the community  \n  \n  \nGiving back  \nCCFS has established itself as one of the local area's largest and fastest\ngrowing employers, now employing 684 people primarily in Wolverhampton.\nProviding support to our community is an important part of our overall\nstrategy. Every year we ask our employees to nominate a local charity that\nthey would like us to support. This decision is made by the Charity Committee\nwith final approval from  \nthe CEO.  \n  \nIn 2019, we raised over **\u00a3** 92k for Socks and Chocs, a local charity that\nsupports the homeless in the West Midlands  \nand beyond. In addition to our existing charitable contributions which have\ntotalled **\u00a3** 373k since 2008, CCFS offers a Good Causes fund that can be\nused towards special charity events being undertaken by, or linked to,\nemployees or their families. In addition, we have  \nlongstanding relationships as supporters of local cricket and rugby clubs, and\nCCFS and its brands are passionate supporters of the local community. This\nyear, Charter Savings Bank increased its focus on supporting overlooked and\nunderserved UK communities through new partnerships with local sports clubs.  \n  \nWorking alongside both Coventry Rugby Club and Wolverhampton Rugby Club, we\nare actively demonstrating the values we share with our customers.  \n  \nCoventry Rugby Club  \nIn 2019, Charter Savings Bank entered into a new partnership with Coventry\nRugby Club, focusing on inspiring young children through two important\ninitiatives: Rugby and Reading, and Rugby in Schools.  \n  \nRugby and Reading is designed to inspire disadvantaged and disaffected\nchildren to read more. Our programme is led by members of Coventry's elite\nfirst team who go into schools to read books with children aged between 5 and\n11, enabling them to exercise both body and mind  \nas they experience an hour of engaging storytelling before enjoying a hands-on\ngame of tag rugby.  \n  \n  \nRugby in Schools gives boys and girls aged between 5 and 16 access to coaching\nsessions delivered by one of Coventry's top performing first team players,\nproviding one-to-one interactions with positive role models as well as\nreceiving professional coaching.  \n  \nAs title partners for both programmes, we have committed to support over 100\nhours of rugby-based learning activity in total a fantastic opportunity for\nchildren in local schools.  \n  \nIn addition to the two programmes, CSB is supporting Coventry Rugby's\ncharitable Foundation with their efforts to improve the lives of children\ncurrently living in  \npoverty across the city, by providing access to a Match Day Experience and\nsupporting their Project:500 initiative.  \n  \nMatch Day Experience gives 40 disaffected and disadvantaged children the\nopportunity to attend a live Championship rugby game, enjoy a tour of the\nground, take part in a pre-game coaching session on the pitch and participate\nin a Q&A with first team players.  \n  \nProject:500 aims to use rugby to drive positive engagement with children\nliving in poverty, giving 500 disadvantaged and disaffected children the\nchance to learn through sport and give them an opportunity to be part of a\npositive and inclusive community. CSB has funded spaces for children on the\nprogramme, with the first event in October reported as a major success and the\nfirst step  \nin Coventrys goal to lift children out of poverty.  \n  \nWolverhampton Rugby Club  \nIn November 2019, Charter Savings Bank and Wolverhampton Rugby Club announced\nan extension to their longstanding partnership, reinforcing the Bank's\ncommitment to the  \nClub's development.  \n  \nTo mark the occasion, CSB upgraded the Club's Castlecroft base with a brand-\nnew pitch-side electronic scoreboard, which will now provide up-to-the-minute\ninformation for over 200 grassroots rugby fans  \neach week.  \n  \n  \nSince the partnership began, the Bank has been keen to ensure its support\nmakes  \na real difference.  \n  \nIn 2016, it was instrumental in providing significant funds towards\nrenovations to Wolverhampton's changing room facilities, which are now used by\nup to  \n15 of Wolverhampton's male and female development teams.  \n  \nBy partnering for a further five years, CSB is helping the club provide\ngrassroots sporting opportunities for the local community for both male and\nfemale  \nplayers, across a wide-range of ages, and for their loyal supporters in the\nlocal area.  \n  \nLooking forward to 2020  \n  \n  \nAs OneSavings Bank and Charter Court Financial Services have now come\ntogether, we will be looking to bring together the best of all of our\ncommunity activities, and continue to support our people in fulfilling their\npassions to support matters that are close to their hearts.  \n  \n  \nSection 172 statement  \nSection 172 of the Companies Act 2006 requires a Director of a company to act\nin the way he or she considers, in good  \nfaith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the\nbenefit  \nof its members as a whole. In doing this, section 172 requires a Director to\nhave regard, among other matters, to: the likely consequences of any decision\nin the long term; the interests of the  \ncompany's employees; the need to foster the company's business relationships\nwith suppliers, customers and others; the impact of the company's operations\non the community and the environment; the desirability of the company\nmaintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct; and the need\nto act fairly with members of the company.  \n  \nThe Directors give careful consideration  \nto the factors set out above in discharging their duties under section 172.\nThe stakeholders we consider in this regard are our employees, our customers,\nour shareholders, the regulators and the local communities in which we are\nlocated.  \n  \nThe Board recognises that building strong relationships with our stakeholders\nwill help us to deliver our strategy in line with our long-term values, and\noperate the business in a sustainable way.  \n  \nStakeholder engagement  \n  \n  \nThe Board is committed to effective engagement with all of its stakeholders.\nThe Board and its Committees regularly receive reports from management  \non issues concerning customers, the environment, communities, suppliers,\nemployees, regulators and investors, which they take into account in their\ndiscussions and in their decision-making process under section 172.  \n  \nThe Board and its Committees undertake deep dive reviews to further develop\ntheir understanding of key issues impacting all stakeholders. In addition to\nthis, the Board seeks to understand the interests and views of the Group's\nstakeholders by engaging with them directly as appropriate. Some of the ways\nin which the Board has engaged directly with stakeholders over the year  \nare shown below.  \n  \nCustomers  \nOur customers are at the centre of what we do. During 2019, we ran a special\ncampaign focusing on different customer groups. The campaign focused on\nbringing the customers to life through life-sized cardboard cut-outs in the\noffice and video clips telling their stories. These customers were then used\nto generate discussions on the needs of such customers and  \nhow the best outcome can be achieved for them. The campaign generated numerous\nconversations and insights into how customer service can be tailored to\nmaximise customer experience. More information on our customers is provided on\npage 76.  \n  \nEmployees  \nIn addition to the Board receiving updates from senior management on various\nmetrics and feedback tools in relation to employees, members of the Board\nengage with the Group's employees in a variety  \nof ways. A Workforce Advisory Forum (OneVoice) was established and Mary\nMcNamara serves as the designated Non- Executive Director representing the\nview of employees. Other Non-Executive Directors and members of the Group\nExecutive Committee are also encouraged to attend OneVoice on a rotating\nbasis. More details on OneVoice are provided on page 145  \nin the Corporate Governance Report. Further information on engagement with\nemployees is provided on pages 77.  \n  \nInvestors  \nThe Board regularly receives updates on feedback from investors from senior\nmanagement. In addition, various members of the Board, including the Chairman\nand Chair of the Group  \nRemuneration Committee meet frequently with institutional investors to discuss  \nand provide updates about and seek feedback on the business, strategy, long-\nterm financial performance and the Directors' Remuneration Policy. Members of\nthe Board also met shareholders at the AGM, as well as receiving briefings\nfrom the Group Head of Investor Relations  \non shareholders. Further information on feedback from institutional investors\nin relation to the Remuneration Policy  \nis provided on page 144.  \n  \nRegulators  \nMembers of the Board regularly meet with the Group's regulators. There was\nincreased engagement with regulators during 2019, due to the Combination.\nSince the Combination, the Group has moved to a Level 2 firm, as designated by\nthe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This means that the number  \nof interactions with regulators will increase for 2020 and beyond.  \n  \nDecision-making  \n  \n  \nWe set out below an example of how the Directors have had regard to the\nmatters set out in section 172(1)(a) to (f) when discharging their duties\nunder section 172 and the effect of the decisions taken by them. The most\nsignificant decision taken during 2019 was the Combination with CCFS. The\nBoard carefully weighed the benefits of the Combination for investors,\ncustomers, employees and the company (which are outlined on page 5) against\nany impact on those stakeholders.  \n  \nThe financial consequences of the Combination were assessed by the Board and\nindependently challenged by external advisers. The Board also considered the\noperational consequences of the decision and the resources needed to achieve\nthe desired outcomes; this included meeting the expectations of our\nregulators. On balance, the Board considered that the benefits of the\nCombination outweighed the detriment to certain stakeholders and the risk\nassociated with the transaction.  \n  \n  \nNon-financial information statement  \nIn the 2019 Annual Report, OSB Group has addressed the requirements of\nsections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 2006 relating to non-financial\nreporting. The table below summarises key disclosure requirements and provides\nreferences to where further information can be found, which taken together\nform the 2019 Non-financial information statement.  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n**Policies** |  |  \n  \n  \n  \n**Due diligence** |  |  \n  \n  \n  \n**Outcomes/impact** |  **Section within the**  \n **Annual Report**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n**Environmental matters** |  |  |  |  |  \n**Description inc. objectives**  \n  \nOSB\u2019s Environmental Policy sets out commitment to reducing our environmental\nimpact and to continually improve our environmental performance as an integral\npart of our business strategy.

This includes ensuring that the views of all other Directors are\ncommunicated to, and given due consideration by, the Chairman. In addition,\nthe SID is responsible for leading the annual appraisal of the Chairman's\nperformance.  \n  \nThe SID is also available to shareholders should they wish to discuss concerns\nabout the Company other than through the Chairman and CEO.  \n  \nCompany Secretary  \nThe Company Secretary, Jason Elphick, plays a key role within the Company,\nadvising on good governance and assisting the Board to discharge its\nresponsibilities, acting with integrity and independence to protect the\ninterests of the Company, its shareholders and employees. Jason advises the\nCompany to ensure that it complies with all statutory and regulatory  \nrequirements and he works closely with the Chairman, CEO and Chairs of the\nCommittees of the Board so that Board procedures (including setting agendas\nand the timely distribution of papers) are complied with, and that there is a\ngood communication flow between the Board, its Committees, senior management\nand NEDs. Jason also provides the Directors with advice and support, including\nfacilitating induction programmes and training in conjunction with the\nChairman.  \n  \nEffectiveness  \n  \n  \nBalance and independence  \nThe effectiveness of the Board and its Committees in discharging their duties\nis essential for the success of the Company. In order to operate effectively,\nthe Board and its Committees comprise  \na balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge to encourage\nconstructive debate and challenge to the decision- making process.  \n  \nThe Board comprises eight NEDs, the Chairman and two Executive Directors. All\nof the NEDs, including the Chairman, have been determined by the Board to be\nindependent in character and judgement and free from relationships or\ncircumstances which may affect, or could appear to affect, the relevant\nindividual's judgement. The independence of the NEDs is reviewed continuously,\nincluding a formal annual review. Any NED who does not meet the independence\ncriteria will not stand for election or re-election at the AGM.  \n  \nThe size and composition of the Board is kept under review by the Group\nNomination and Governance Committee and the Board to ensure an appropriate\nbalance of skills and experience are represented. An external skills review\nwas undertaken during 2019. The Board is satisfied that its current\ncomposition allows  \nit to operate effectively and that all Directors are able to bring specific\ninsights and make valuable contributions to the Board, due to their varied\ncommercial backgrounds. The NEDs provide constructive challenge to the\nExecutives, and the Chairman ensures that the views of all Directors are taken\ninto consideration in the Board's deliberations. The Directors' biographies\ncan be found on pages 96 and 97.  \n  \nNon-Executive Directors' terms of appointment  \n  \n  \nNEDs are appointed for terms of three years, subject to annual re-election by\nshareholders. The initial term may be renewed up to a maximum of three terms\n(nine years). The terms of appointment of the NEDs specify the amount of time\nthey are expected to devote to the business, which is a minimum of two and\nhalf days per month, calculated based on the time required to prepare for and\nattend Board and Committee meetings, the  \nAGM, meetings with shareholders and training. Their commitment also extends to\nworking such additional hours as may be required in exceptional circumstances.  \n  \nNEDs are required to confirm annually that they continue to have sufficient\ntime to devote to the role.  \n  \nAppointment, retirement and re-election of Directors  \n  \n  \nThe Board may appoint a Director, either to fill a vacancy or as an addition\nto the existing Board. All appointments are subject to a formal, rigorous and\ntransparent procedure; succession is also considered. Appointments and\nsuccession planning are based  \non merit and objective criteria and, within this context, promotes diversity\nof gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths.\nAny new Director must then retire at the next AGM and is put forward for\nelection by the shareholders.  \nAll other Directors are put forward for re-election annually. In addition to\nany power of removal conferred by the Companies Act, any Director may be\nremoved by special resolution, before the expiration of his or her period of\noffice and, subject to the Articles, another person who is willing to act as a\nDirector may  \nbe appointed by ordinary resolution in his or her place. Tim Brooke, Margaret\nHassall and Ian Ward will not stand for election or re- election at the AGM\nand will cease to be Directors on 7 May 2020.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nConflicts of interest  \n  \n  \nThe Company's Articles set out the policy for dealing with Directors'\nconflicts of interest and are in line with the Companies Act 2006. The\nArticles permit the Board to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts, as\nlong as the potentially conflicted Director  \nis not counted in the quorum and does not vote on the resolution to authorise\nthe conflict.  \n  \nDirectors are required to complete an annual confirmation including a fitness\nand propriety questionnaire, which requires declarations of external interests\nand potential conflicts. In addition, all Directors are required to declare\ntheir interests  \nin the business to be discussed at each Board and Committee meeting. The\ninterests of new Directors are reviewed during the recruitment process and\nauthorised, if appropriate, by the Board at the time of their appointment. The\nGroup Nomination and Governance Committee also reviews conflicts of interest\nrelating to Directors at least annually; periodic reviews are also undertaken\nas required. The Group has also adopted a Conflicts of Interest Policy, which\nincludes a procedure for identifying potential conflicts of interest within\nthe Group.  \n  \nNo Director had a material interest in any contract of significance in\nrelation to the Group's business at any time during the year  \nor at the date of this report.  \n  \nDirectors' indemnities  \n  \n  \nThe Articles provide, subject to the provisions of UK legislation, an\nindemnity for Directors and Officers of the Group in respect of liabilities\nthey may incur in the discharge of their duties or in  \nthe exercise of their powers, including any liabilities relating to the\ndefence of any proceedings brought against them, which relate to anything done\nor omitted, or alleged to have been done or  \nomitted, by them as Officers or employees of the Group. Directors' and\nOfficers' liability insurance cover is in place in respect of  \nall Directors.  \n  \nDirectors' powers  \n  \n  \nAs set out in the Articles, the business of the Company is managed by the\nBoard, which may exercise all the powers of the Company. In particular, save\nas otherwise provided in company law or in the Articles, the Directors may\nallot (with or without conferring a right of renunciation), grant options\nover, offer, or otherwise deal with or dispose of shares in the Company to\nsuch persons at such times and generally on such terms and conditions as they\nmay determine. The Directors may at any time after the allotment of any share\nbut before any person has been entered  \nin the Register as the holder, recognise a renunciation thereof by the\nallottee in favour of some other person and may accord to any allottee of a\nshare a right to effect such renunciation upon and subject to such terms and\nconditions as the Directors may think fit to impose. Subject to the provisions\nof company law, the Company may purchase any of its own shares (including any\nredeemable shares).  \n  \n  \nTraining and development  \n  \n  \nThe Chairman ensures that all Directors receive a tailored induction on\njoining the Board, with the aim of providing a new Director with the\ninformation required to allow him or her to contribute to the running of the\nGroup as soon as possible. The induction programme is facilitated and\nmonitored by the Company Secretary to ensure that all information provided is\nfully understood by the new Director and that any queries are dealt with.\nTypically, the induction programme will include a  \ncombination of key documents and face to face sessions covering the\ngovernance, regulatory and other arrangements of the Group. Since the\nCombination, all Directors have had meetings with specific areas of the\nbusiness within the Group.  \n  \nAs senior managers, under the Senior Managers Regime operated by the PRA and\nFCA, all Directors have had to maintain the  \nskills, knowledge and expertise required to meet the demands of their\npositions of significant influence within the Bank. As part of the annual\nfitness and propriety assessment, Directors are required to complete a self-\ncertification that they have undertaken sufficient training during the year to\nmaintain their skills, knowledge and expertise and to make declarations as to\ntheir fitness and propriety. The Company Secretary supports the Directors to\nidentify relevant internal and external courses to  \nensure Directors are kept up to date with key regulatory changes, their\nresponsibilities as senior managers and other matters impacting the business.  \n  \nInformation and support  \n  \n  \nThe Company Secretary and the Chairman agree an annual calendar of matters to\nbe discussed at each Board meeting to ensure that all key Board\nresponsibilities are discharged over the year. Board agendas are then\ndistributed with accompanying detailed papers to Directors in advance of each\nBoard and Committee meeting. These include reports from Executive Directors\nand other members of senior management. All Directors have direct access to\nsenior management should they require additional information on any of the\nitems to be discussed. The Board and Group Audit Committee also receive\nfurther regular and specific reports to allow the monitoring of the adequacy  \nof the Group's systems and controls.  \n  \nThe information supplied to the Board and its Committees is kept under review\nand formally assessed on an annual basis as part of the Board evaluation\nexercise to ensure it is fit for purpose  \nand that it enables sound decision-making.  \n  \nThere is a formal procedure through which Directors may obtain independent\nprofessional advice at the Group's expense. The Directors also have access to\nthe services of the Company Secretary as described on page 105.  \n  \n  \n  \nBoard evaluation  \n  \n  \nThe Board undertakes an evaluation of its performance and that of its\nCommittees and individual Directors annually. An externally-facilitated\nevaluation was conducted during 2019 by Independent Audit. The evaluation was\nconducted by face to face interviews. Independent Audit concluded that members\nof the Board brought a wide range of relevant skills, knowledge and\nexperience. The report outlined that OSB and the Board  \nbenefited from a very capable senior management team noting that the\nenergetic, confident and committed CEO and CFO were universally well regarded\nand possessed the necessary skills to drive growth. The report noted that\ntheir relationship with the Board was one of mutual respect and openness. It\nfurther stated that the quality of reports had improved across most areas,\ngiving the Board foundation for good discussions. It was felt that OSB was on\na positive path and that the Board was well placed to perform its duties\neffectively.  \n  \nIndependent Audit made suggestions which may, collectively or in some\ncombination, contribute to more discursive Board meetings, with adjustments\nbeing made to ways in which the Directors and senior management interact in\norder to benefit the Board. The Board was aware that the technology strategy  \nrequired ongoing attention in light of OSB's growth, as did culture in order\nto monitor how successfully it is being integrated and understood throughout\nthe Group. Independent Audit was satisfied that no individual or group of\nDirectors dominated  \nthe discussions or had undue influence in the decision- making process.  \n  \n  \n\n**Suggestion** |  **Action proposed**  \n---|---  \n**Explore ways in which NEDs can be increasingly equipped to provide more\nwide-ranging strategic challenge as the business grows.** |  Chairman to\nreview Board and individual NED challenge as part  \nof the regular Board effectiveness reviews. Actions to be considered if\nrequired.  \n**Increase the opportunities for NEDs to interact with each other, with\nExecutives and with counterparts from the combined entity.** |  Informal\ncatch-ups will be scheduled around some meetings.  \n**Ensure that a skills matrix is in place (and adjusted following the\nCombination) for NEDs and Executives, with input from the Group Nomination and\nGovernance Committee.** |  Skills matrix developed by an external firm and\npresented to the Group Nomination and Governance Committee in December 2019.  \n**Continue to monitor closely the implementation and integration of the new\nculture.** |  A number of culture surveys were conducted during and after the\nCombination. This will continue as part of the broader post integration\nculture strategy review.  \n**Consider dedicating additional time on Board meeting days to cover the extra\nworkload of the combined Board.** |  50% extra time has been allocated to post\nCombination Board meetings. This will be monitored and adjusted as\nappropriate.  \n  \nChairman and secretary to monitor as part of the Board effectiveness\nmonitoring post Combination.  \n**Consider additional support for HR Department, such as appointing a\nremuneration specialist.** |  To be considered by CEO and Group Nomination and\nGovernance Committee post Combination as part of the operating model review.  \n**Continue to monitor risk reporting to the Board, to ensure it gives a clear\nand effective summary of the debate and encourages NEDs to focus on the\noverarching risk picture.** |  The management information (\u2018MI\u2019) relating to\nRisk has been reviewed and refined throughout 2019. Risk MI will also be\nbenchmarked against industry standards.  \n**The Group Nomination and Governance Committee could be**  \n **more proactive on succession, feeding back more detailed reports to the\nBoard to fuel the creation of a skills matrix for NEDs, which acknowledges the\nvalue of the Board as a combined entity which can be stronger than the sum of\nits parts.** |  An external review was commissioned, which involved\ninteraction with each Board member to create a detailed skills matrix of the\nexisting Board. This report is scheduled for full Board discussion  \nin 2020. A new Board Effectiveness review will be commissioned in 2020 which\nwill continue to work on this and review the effectiveness of the Board as a\nwhole.  \n  \nWhistleblowing  \n  \n  \nThe Group has established procedures by which employees may, in confidence,\nraise concerns relating to possible improprieties  \nin matters of financial reporting, financial control or any other matter. The\nWhistleblowing Policy applies to all employees of the Group and is benchmarked\nagainst industry standards. The Group Audit Committee is responsible for\nmonitoring the Group's whistleblowing arrangements and the Policy.  \n  \nThe Group is confident that the arrangements are effective, facilitate the\nproportionate and independent investigation of reported matters and allow\nappropriate follow-up action to be taken. Further details are provided on page\n116.  \n  \nRelations with shareholders  \n  \n  \nDialogue with shareholders  \nThe Group has a dedicated Investor Relations function which maintains regular,\nopen and transparent dialogue with institutional investors and sell-side\nanalysts. The team has access to the CEO and CFO who are available for\nmeetings with shareholders and frequently attend industry conferences. Twice a\nyear, post year end and half year results, the CEO and the CFO participate in\nroadshows meeting larger investors. In 2019, for OSB only, the Investor\nRelations team and management met  \na total of 140 individual existing and potential investors.  \n  \nThe Board's primary contact with institutional shareholders and sell-side\nanalysts is through the CEO and the CFO. The Board is also regularly presented\nwith shareholders' feedback, analysts' recommendations and market views via\nInvestor Relations updates, topics which are frequently on the Board agenda.  \n  \nAs a result of the Combination and becoming a Level 2 firm, the Group\nconducted a remuneration consultation of the Executive team in the year,\nmeeting with the top ten shareholders. These meetings were attended by the\nthen Chairman, Sir Malcolm Williamson and the re-appointed Chairman, David\nWeymouth providing an opportunity to discuss the proposed remuneration but\nalso any other topics of interest to our investors.  \n  \n  \nAnnual General Meeting  \n  \n  \nThe AGM will be held at the offices of Slaughter and May, One Bunhill Row,\nLondon EC1Y 8YY on 7 May 2020 at 11am. The Chairs of each of the Committees of\nthe Board will be present to answer questions put to them by shareholders. The\nAnnual Report and Accounts and Notice of the AGM will be sent to shareholders  \nat least 20 working days prior to the date of the meeting.  \n  \nShareholders are encouraged to participate in the AGM process, and all\nresolutions will be proposed and voted on at the meeting on an individual\nbasis by shareholders or their proxies. Voting results will be announced and\nmade available on the Company's website, www.osb.co.uk.  \n  \nShareholders may require the Directors to call a general meeting other than an\nAGM as provided by the Companies Act 2006.  \nRequests to call a general meeting may be made by members representing at\nleast 5% of the paid-up capital of the Company as carries the right of voting\nat general meetings of the Company (excluding any paid-up capital held as\ntreasury shares).

Prior to the Combination, Rod Duke served as Chair of the Committee\nand I would like to thank him for his service and contribution.  \n  \nA number of items were considered by the Committee during 2019, including\nexamination of the revised UK Corporate Governance Code against practices to\nensure compliance at the earliest opportunity. The Bank's progress in terms of\nachieving the commitments set out in the Women in Finance Charter and various\ndiversity initiatives were also reviewed. I am very pleased to announce that\nOSB achieved its three year target during 2019 of having 30% of senior roles\nin the Bank occupied by women by 2020. During 2019, CCFS also made progress\ntowards its targets, and since the Combination the Committee has been\nreviewing and intends to shortly publish a new revised Group target for  \nthe combined entity.  \n  \nFurther details on areas considered by the Committee are provided on pages 110\nand 111.  \n  \nDavid Weymouth  \nChair of the Group Nomination and Governance Committee and Chairman of the\nBoard  \n19 March 2020  \nGroup Nomination and Governance Committee Report continued  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nResponsibilities  \n  \n  \nThe specific responsibilities and duties of the Committee are set out in its\nterms of reference which are available on our website, www.osb.co.uk.  \n  \nComposition of the Board and its Committees  \n  \n  \nThe Committee conducted a review of the composition of the Group Audit, Group\nRemuneration and Group Risk Committees and its own composition during 2019,\ncarefully considering the skills of the existing members and looking at any\nskills gaps applicable to each Committee. Sarah Hedger was appointed as a NED\non 1 February 2019 following an extensive search for  \nan individual whose skills it was felt would add additional value to the\nBoard.  \n  \nOn combining with CCFS, a number of changes were made to the Board and\nCommittee memberships. Sir Malcolm Williamson was appointed Chairman of the\nBoard, with David Weymouth (the previous Chairman) assuming the role of Deputy\nChair and  \nleading the newly-established Board Integration Committee with a clear focus\non the delivery of cost synergies and other expected benefits of the\nCombination. As part of the Combination, Tim Brooke, Noel Harwerth, Rajan\nKapoor and Ian Ward (previously NEDs of CCFS) were appointed to the Board,\nwith Noel Harwerth assuming the role of the SID. In addition, Rajan Kapoor was\nappointed as Chair of the Group Audit Committee; Sir Malcolm Williamson was\nappointed as Chair of this Committee and has since retired; David Weymouth now\nChairs this Committee.  \nGraham Allatt and Mary McNamara remained as Chairs to the Group Risk Committee\nand Group Remuneration Committee respectively. A Group Models and Ratings\nCommittee was also established, with effect from January 2020, which Graham\nAllatt will Chair.  \n  \nOn 4 February 2020, Sir Malcolm Williamson retired as Chairman of the Board\nand David Weymouth resumed the role of Chairman. On the same date, Rod Duke\nresigned from the OSB Board and was appointed Chairman of the CCFSL Board;\nEric Anstee also resigned. Tim Brooke, Margaret Hassall and Ian Ward will step\ndown from the Board after the AGM. David Weymouth was not involved in\ndiscussions relating to his appointment as Chairman.  \n  \nSuccession planning  \n  \n  \nThe Committee considered both Board and Executive level succession planning\nduring 2019, including ways in which skills could be developed. The\nCombination provided an opportunity for a wholesale review of the balance of\nskills required on the Board. An external firm was engaged to assist with this\nprocess. The findings were then used to discuss the optimum composition of the\nBoard. In 2019, there has been considerable focus in the Bank on establishing\nthe new Group Executive Committee, drawing  \non senior executives from both OSB and CCFS in doing so. That process is now\ncomplete, noting that whilst two banking licences are retained there will be a\nseparate Chief Risk Officer for each of the regulated Banks. In 2019, the\nCommittee refined its review of Executive skills, in particular with a\ndetailed succession plan  \nestablished for each role, drawing upon a review of existing talent across\nboth of the Banks.  \n  \n  \nThe Committee also received updates on the performance of the wider employee\npopulation, including those participating in the Primary Talent Group.  \n  \nDiversity  \n  \n  \nOur Bank recognises and embraces the benefits of having a diverse Board and\nworkforce, and sees diversity at Board level as an essential element in\nmaintaining a competitive advantage. We believe that a truly diverse Board and\nworkforce will include and make good use of differences in the skills,\nregional and industry experience, age, background, race, gender and other\ndistinctions between people. The Board recognises for itself that diversity is\nthe key to better decision-making and avoiding group think.  \n  \nThese differences are considered in determining the optimum composition of the\nBoard and, where possible, will be balanced appropriately. All Board\nappointments are made on merit, in the context of the skills, experience,\nindependence and knowledge which the Board as a whole requires to be\neffective.  \n  \nThe Committee regularly reviews diversity initiatives including its annual\nreview of the Diversity and Inclusion Policy. The Board remains committed to\nthe Women in Finance Charter and has introduced measurable objectives with the\naim continuing to  \nbe that 30% of senior management positions within the Group's UK population\nwill be undertaken by female employees by the end of 2020. Currently, 15% of\nthe Group Executive Committee and 45% of our Board are female, placing us in\nthe top 12 of the FTSE 250 for gender diversity. 9% of the Board is from an\nethnic minority. The Board recognises and embraces the benefits that diversity\ncan bring to its Board and sees diversity and inclusion at Board level as an\nessential element in maintaining a competitive advantage. This will be\nreviewed again at the end of 2020, post significant integration activities.  \n  \nOur Bank has also appointed a Diversity and Inclusion Champion, Jason Elphick,\nto promote a series of diversity initiatives such as our commitment to those\nwith a disability, mental health in the workplace and unconscious bias\ntraining.  \n  \n  \nFurther details relating to diversity and inclusion are set out  \non page 81.  \nGovernance  \n  \n  \nThe Committee reviewed changes in the regulatory landscape, particularly the\nremit and composition of Committees following the Combination.  \n  \nActivities during 2019  \nIn last year's report the Committee identified eight key priorities.  \n  \nA summary of actions taken and outcomes are set out in the table below.  \n  \n\n**Objective** |  **Action taken**  \n---|---  \n**Consider the approach to Board and Group Executive succession planning and\nthe extent to which that planning incorporates a range of diversity criteria\nbeyond gender diversity.** |  The Combination with CCFS in 2019 meant the\nfocus of this action was firstly to establish the new optimal Board and Group\nExecutive team. An external review led to a series of recommendations to be\nactioned by the Committee and the Board regarding Board composition in 2020.\nIn addition, the Committee reviewed the succession plans for the prior\nExecutive team (before the Combination) during 2019 and will conduct an in-\ndepth review of executive succession plans across both Banks during 2020.  \n**Consider further training and development needs for Committee members.** |\nTraining and development needs for Committee members were reviewed and\ntraining plans prepared for each Committee and broader Board members during\n2019. This involved a combination of tailored internally provided training and\nattendance at externally provided training events.  \n**Provide oversight of how the Mission, Vision and Values are being\nembedded.** |  The Committee received regular updates on culture and\nengagement, reviewed and tested externally run surveys (the Sunday Times Best\nCompanies to Work For and the Banking Standards Board surveys).  \n**Corporate governance reform.** |  The Committee receives regular updates on\ncorporate governance changes in the industry, including the steps being taken\nby the Group to ensure compliance with any relevant changes.  \n**Embedding diversity initiatives and reduction of the gender pay gap.** |\nThe Bank has raised awareness of the various initiatives that have been put  \nin place to support diversity. Such initiatives relate to disabled facilities,\nmental health awareness workshops, the introduction of a Women\u2019s Networking\nForum and unconscious bias training. Regular updates are provided to the\nCommittee on the progress of diversity initiatives.  \n**External Board and Committee effectiveness.** |  An externally-facilitated\nevaluation of the Board and its Committees was undertaken during 2019, with a\npositive result overall. The Committee also reviewed and monitored the action\nplan of suggested improvements. Further details are set out on page 107.  \n**Oversee progress with the Group\u2019s purpose and sustainability.** |  The\nCommittee reviewed the Environmental Policy and the actions being taken to\nenable the Bank to continue to operate sustainably.  \n**Oversee development of the talent pipeline.** |  Members of the Committee\nmet with the Primary Talent Group (\u2018PTG\u2019) to understand the level of support\nprovided to them and what other support would be beneficial. The Committee\nalso received periodic reports of the activities undertaken by the PTG.  \n  \n  \nPriorities for 2020  \nThe Committee's priorities for 2020 are:  \n  \n\\- Ensuring that the composition and size of the Board and Board Committees\nremains appropriate post Combination.  \n\\- Overseeing the development of succession plans for Group Executive\nCommittee members and key Board roles.  \n\\- Oversee the development of the revised Mission, Vision and Values for the\ncombined Group, along with the strategy to embed them.  \n\\- Review and agree the new combined diversity initiatives and reduction of\nthe gender pay gap.  \n\\- External Board and Committee effectiveness review.  \n\\- Oversee progress with the Group's combined purpose and sustainability\ninitiatives.  \n\\- Oversee the development of the talent pipeline and its relationship to\nsuccession planning.  \n\\- Provide oversight of the newly-established employee forum, OneVoice.  \n  \nGroup Audit Committee Report  \n  \n  \n  \nThe Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the Group's\nfinancial reports and disclosures.  \n  \n  \nDear Shareholder,  \n  \n  \nI am pleased to present my first report of the Group Audit Committee for 2019,\nfollowing my appointment as its Chair in October 2019. The Committee is\nresponsible for monitoring and reviewing the Group's financial reports and\ndisclosures, its accounting policies and practices and systems of internal\ncontrols, including internal financial controls. The Committee manages the\nrelationship with the external auditors and  \noversees the work of the Internal Audit function. During the year, the\nCommittee has continued to focus on areas of significant judgement in the\nfinancial statements, including those relating to the Combination with CCFS,\nas set out in the report below.  \n  \nTaken as a whole, the Committee has an appropriate balance of skills,\nincluding recent and relevant financial experience.  \nIn addition to members, standing invitations to Committee meetings are\nextended to the Executive Directors, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Internal\nAuditor, Group Conduct and Compliance Director and the external audit partner;\nall of whom attend meetings as a matter of practice. Other non-members  \nmay be invited to attend all or part of any meeting as and when appropriate.  \n  \nThe Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. The Group Chief\nInternal Auditor and the external auditor attended all meetings during the\nyear and also met in private  \nwith the Committee; they have also had regular contact with the previous Chair\nthroughout the year, as well as myself following my appointment. I discuss and\nagree the agenda with the Chief Financial Officer and Group Chief Internal\nAuditor in advance of each meeting and receive a full briefing on the key\nagenda items.  \n  \nUpon assuming the role of Chair, I also became the Group Whistleblowers'\nChampion. The Committee oversees the framework and its operational\neffectiveness and reports to the Board on such matters. I have specific\nresponsibility for overseeing the integrity, effectiveness and independence of\nthe Group's policies and procedures on whistleblowing.  \n  \nFurther details on the activities of the Committee during the year and how it\ndischarged its responsibilities are provided in the Report below.  \n  \nRajan Kapoor  \nChair of the Group Audit Committee  \n19 March 2020  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nMembership and meetings  \n  \n  \nThe Committee met seven times during the year. The current members of the\nCommittee are Rajan Kapoor as Chair, Graham Allatt, Tim Brooke and Sarah\nHedger. Eric Anstee was Chair of the Committee until 4 October 2019 and a\nmember until 4 February 2020 when he stepped down from the Board. Margaret\nHassall ceased to be a member of the Committee on 4 October 2019. Tim Brooke\nwill cease to be a member of the Committee on 7 May 2020. Rajan Kapoor served\nas Chair of the CCFS Audit Committee and has wide-ranging finance experience\nin the banking industry.  \n  \nResponsibilities  \n  \n  \nThe primary role of the Committee is to assist the Board in overseeing the\nsystems of internal control and external  \nfinancial reporting across the Group. The Committee's specific\nresponsibilities are set out in its terms of reference, which are reviewed at\nleast annually. These are available on the Company's website, www.osb.co.uk,\nand cover external and internal audit, financial reporting, compliance,\nwhistleblowing, fraud and internal controls.  \n  \nIn addition, the Chair of the Group Audit Committee is available to meet with\nthe Company's investors on request, in accordance with the Financial Reporting\nCouncil's (FRC) Stewardship Code.  \n  \nActivities during 2019  \n  \n  \nThe principal activities undertaken by the Committee during the year are\ndescribed below.  \n  \nSignificant areas of judgement considered by the Committee  \n  \n  \nThe following significant accounting judgements were considered by the\nCommittee in relation to the interim and full year results of the Group. The\nCommittee also focused on the classification of Loan book Expected Credit\nLosses  \n  \n  \nThe Committee received and challenged reports from management prior to each\nreporting date, explaining the approach taken to provisioning and the\nresulting changes in provision levels during the period.  \n  \nPost completion of the Combination with CCFS, the Committee reviewed and\nchallenged management's proposals relating to the:  \n  \n\\- IFRS 9 provision requirements for the purchase of originated credit\nimpaired (POCI) assets in respect of CCFS as set as at the date of\nCombination.  \n\\- Stage 2 transfer criteria: management proposed the implementation of an\naligned transfer criteria framework which incorporated both a quantitative\napproach, which assessed whether a significant increase in credit risk had\nbeen observed (i.e. change in probability of default level) from the point of\norigination, supplemented by a qualitative rules-based approach, using both\ninternal and external credit bureau information.  \n\\- Stage 3 transfer criteria: CCFS implemented an aligned stage 3 logic within\nthe reporting period.  \n\\- Macroeconomic scenarios and probability weightings: management proposed\nutilising a common set of macroeconomic scenarios across both businesses,\ncoupled with aligned probability weightings. Post the UK General Election\nresult, the Committee received reports from the Group's economic adviser and\nmanagement proposing a revised set of probability weightings. The Committee\nrevised the original management proposals on how probabilities attached to the\nscenarios had changed during the period and ultimately approved the final\nweightings utilised within the Group's impairment calculations. The Group\ncontinued to utilise four scenarios; an upside, base case and two further\ndownside scenarios.  \n  \nLoan book acquisition accounting and income recognition  \n  \nintegration costs including exceptional items. In its assessment,  \n  \nthe Committee considered and challenged reports from management, explaining\neach area of significant judgement and management's recommended approach. The\nCommittee also received reports from the external auditor setting out their\nviews on the accounting treatment and judgements underpinning the financial\nstatements.  \n  \nThe Group did not acquire any loan portfolios (other than the loans acquired\nin the Combination) in 2019. However, it has acquired a number of portfolios\nin prior years. Acquired loan books are initially recognised at fair value.\nSignificant judgement is required in calculating their effective interest rate\n(EIR), using cash flow models, which include assumptions on the likely\nmacroeconomic environment, including House Price Index (HPI), unemployment\nlevels and interest rates, as well as loan level  \nand portfolio attributes and history used to derive prepayment rates, the\nprobability and timing of defaults and the amount of incurred losses. The EIRs\non loan books purchased at significant discounts are particularly sensitive to\nthe prepayment and default rates assumed, as the purchase discount is\nrecognised over the expected life of the loan book through the EIR. New\ndefaults  \nare modelled at zero loss (as losses will be recognised in profit and loss as\nimpairment losses) and therefore have the same impact on EIR as prepayments.\nIncurred losses at acquisition are calculated using the Group's collective\nprovision model. The Committee reviewed and challenged reports from management\nbefore each reporting date on the approach taken. Particular focus was given\nto loan books where performance varied from expectation. The Committee\nreviewed a comparison of actual cash flows to those assumed in the cash flow\nmodels by book to challenge management's assessment of the need to update cash\nflow projections and adjust carrying values accordingly.  \n  \nEffective interest rate  \n  \n  \nA number of assumptions are made when calculating the effective interest rate\nfor newly-originated loan assets. These include their expected lives, likely\nredemption profiles and the anticipated level of any early redemption charges\n(ERCs). Certain mortgage products offered by the Group include significant\ndirectly-attributable net fee income, in particular certain Buy-to- Let\nproducts, and/or those that transfer to a higher revert rate after an initial\ndiscount or fixed period. Judgement is used in assessing the expected rate of\nprepayment during the discounted or fixed period and during the period post\nrate reversion. The Group uses historical experience of customer behaviour in\nits assessment along with economic outlook and market conditions.  \n  \nOSB  \n  \n  \nIn 2018, OSB introduced a period spent on the higher reversion rate in the EIR\nfor two year fixed products. This was expanded to include three and five year\nfixed mortgages in 2019, as additional behavioural trends emerged. The assumed\nperiod spent on  \nthe revert rate was based on a careful consideration of past behavioural data\nand the potential impact of the economic and regulatory outlook. The Committee\nalso reviewed and challenged other assumptions used in the EIR calculations,\nin particular, prepayment curves applied in the redemption profile. Prepayment\ncurves for fixed rate mortgages were approved by the OSB Assets and\nLiabilities Committee prior to implementation.  \n  \nCCFS  \n  \n  \nThe Committee received information on the prepayment curve change proposals\nand supporting analysis to enable them to independently challenge the approach\nand conclusions.  \n  \nThe Committee also received and reviewed sensitivity analysis for key\nassumptions. Based on this work, the Committee is satisfied that the approach\ntaken and judgements made were reasonable.  \n  \nFurther details of the above significant areas of judgement can be found in\nnote 3 to the financial statements.  \n  \n  \nCombination accounting  \n  \n  \nThe Committee considered, reviewed and challenged the acquisition accounting\nfor the Combination with CCFS. This included the purchase price allocation\n(PPA) incorporating fair valuation of acquired tangible assets and liabilities\nand the identification and valuation of intangible assets.  \n  \nAn established model already in place at CCFS was used to determine the fair\nvalue of the loan book and associated pipeline. The Committee received and\nchallenged the sensitivity analysis presented by management and also\nconsidered prices achieved on structured asset sales in 2019 and 2020.  \n  \nManagement used an independent external expert for advice on PPA and the\nidentification and valuation of intangibles. The Committee reviewed and\nchallenged the approach taken and  \nkey assumptions and judgements made together with sensitivity analysis. Based\non this work, the Committee was satisfied that the approach taken and\njudgements made in respect of the Combination accounting and PPA were\nreasonable.  \n  \nHedged assets  \n  \n  \nThe Committee was also updated on the results of management's regular reviews\nof the amortisation profile of fair value adjustments on hedged assets\nassociated with cancelled swaps in OSB, against the roll-off of the underlying\nlegacy back book of long-dated fixed rate mortgages. The Group accelerated the\namortisation of fair value adjustments on hedged assets during the year, in\nline with the mortgage asset run-off, due to faster than expected prepayments.  \n  \nFinancial Reporting  \n  \n  \nThe Committee's review of financial reporting during the year included the\nAnnual Report and Accounts, the Interim Results, quarterly trading updates,\nanalysts presentations and pillar  \n3 disclosures. As part of its review, the Committee assessed management's\napplication of key accounting policies, significant accounting judgements and\ncompliance with disclosure requirements to ensure that these were consistent\nand appropriate to satisfy the relevant requirements. In particular, the\nCommittee considered carefully the presentation of results on both a statutory\nand pro forma basis to ensure transparency and consistency throughout.  \n  \nViability and Going Concern  \n  \n  \nThe Committee considered the current position of the Group, along with\nprincipal and emerging risks and assessed the prospects of the Group before\nrecommending to the Board the Group's long-term viability statement. The\nCommittee also  \nundertook a review before recommending to the Board that the going concern\nbasis should be adopted in preparing the annual and interim financial\nstatements.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nFinancial Reporting Council review  \n  \n  \nThe Committee reviewed comments received from the Financial Reporting Council\n(FRC) on the OSB 2018 Annual Report and Accounts and management's proposed\nresponses. These included enhancing disclosures in the 2019 Annual Report and\nAccounts in respect of non-financial information and aligning ECL disclosures,\nwhere possible, with the recommendations made by the Taskforce on Disclosures\nabout Expected Credit Losses.  \nThe Committee notes that the review conducted by the FRC was based solely on\nthe Group's published report and accounts and does not provide any assurance\nthat the report and accounts are correct in all material respects.  \n  \nFair, balanced and understandable  \n  \n  \nThe Committee considered, on behalf of the Board, whether the 2019 Annual\nReport and Accounts taken as a whole are fair, balanced and understandable,\nand whether the disclosures are appropriate. The Committee reviewed the\nGroup's procedures around the preparation, review and challenge of the Annual  \n  \nusing a risk-based methodology, including input from senior management and the\nCommittee. A written report is prepared following the conclusion of each\nInternal Audit engagement and distributed to the Committee and senior\nmanagement.  \nResponsibility for ensuring appropriate corrective action is taken, lies with\nmanagement. The Internal Audit function follows up on engagement findings and\nrecommendations until remedial actions have been completed.  \n  \nInternal Audit maintains a close relationship with the Group's external\nauditor, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte). The external auditor is informed of Internal\nAudit's activities and results. The Committee carries out an annual review of\nthe effectiveness of the Internal Audit function. In 2019, this was\nfacilitated by a survey completed by Committee members, certain executives and\nthe external auditors who had interacted with the Internal Audit function\nduring the year. Following the review, the Committee was satisfied that the\nInternal Audit function operated effectively during the year.  \n  \nSystems of internal control and risk management  \n  \nReport and the consistency of the narrative sections with the  \n  \nfinancial statements and the use of alternative performance measures and\nassociated disclosures.  \n  \nFollowing its review, the Committee is satisfied that the Annual Report is\nfair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for\nshareholders and other stakeholders to assess the Group's position and\nperformance, business model and strategy, and has advised the Board\naccordingly.  \n  \nPillar 3 disclosures  \nThe Committee approved the Group's Pillar 3 regulatory disclosures for\npublication on the Group's website, following a review of the governance and\ncontrol procedures around their preparation.  \n  \nInternal Audit  \n  \n  \nThe primary role of the Internal Audit function is to protect the assets,\nreputation and sustainability of the Group. It assists the Group in\naccomplishing its objectives by providing independent and objective assurance\non the design and operating effectiveness of the Group's risk management,\ngovernance, control framework and processes.  \n  \nThe Group Chief Internal Auditor and her team are supported by a panel of co-\nsource firms who provide expert resource, when requested, on specific internal\naudits. The co-source model has been applied to CCFS as at 1 January 2020.\nPrior to this date, CCFS outsourced its Internal Audit function to KPMG. KPMG\nnow forms part of the co-source panel to ensure that the experience and\nknowledge gained from CCFS is retained within the Group.  \n  \nThe Internal Audit Charter, which formally defines Internal Audit's purpose,\nauthority and responsibility, was benchmarked against the latest guidance\npublished by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and approved by the\nCommittee in November 2019. The Committee also approved the annual Internal\nAudit Plan, which was developed, based on a prioritisation of the audit\nuniverse  \n  \nThe Committee received regular reports from the Group Chief Internal Auditor\nduring 2019, which included progress updates against the Internal Audit Plan,\nthe results of audits undertaken and any outstanding audit action points. The\nCommittee approved the annual review of the Compliance Risk Assessment and\nAssurance Plan and received regular reports from the Group's Compliance\nfunction. The Committee used the Internal Audit  \nand Compliance Reports for its assessment of the effectiveness of the Group's\nsystem of internal controls and risk management. The Committee also received a\nreport on the effectiveness of the Group's system of controls from the CEO,\nwhich was based on  \na self-assessment process completed by senior managers and executives in the\nGroup.  \n  \nThe Committee received and reviewed reports from management on the status of\nthe substantiation of balance sheet general ledger accounts prior to the\nreporting date. The systems of internal control and risk management have been\nin place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the\nAnnual Report and Accounts.  \n  \nThe Committee reviewed and approved a number of policies following their\nannual update, including: anti-bribery and corruption, data protection, data\nretention and record management, fraud, sanctions, whistleblowing and anti-\nmoney laundering and counter terrorist financing. The Committee received\nreports on fraud prevention arrangements, fraud incidents, whistleblowing and\nan annual report from the Group's Money Laundering Reporting Officer during\nthe year. The Committee also received regular updates on data governance and\ncontrols as the Group continued to enhance its data governance arrangements in\nconnection with its planned application for an Internal Ratings-Based (IRB)\nmodel for capital requirements.  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nWhistleblowing  \n  \n  \nThe Committee is responsible for monitoring the Group's Whistleblowing Policy\nand arrangements. Where concerns have been raised, a detailed report is\nprovided on the investigation, actions taken, lessons learnt and changes made\nas a result.  \nThe Chair of the Committee has overall responsibility for whistleblowing\narrangements with oversight from the Board. Training and periodic updates are\nprovided to all employees who are encouraged to use the multiple channels\navailable to raise any concern they have. No concerns were raised that\nrequired  \na report to be made to the regulators.  \n  \nExternal auditor  \n  \n  \nThe Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's relationship with its\nexternal auditor, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte). This includes the ongoing\nassessment of the auditor's independence and the effectiveness of the external\naudit process, the results of which inform the Committee's recommendation to\nthe Board relating to the auditor's appointment (subject to shareholder\napproval) or otherwise.  \n  \nAppointment and tenure  \n  \n  \nDeloitte was appointed as external auditor of the Group from 2019 following a\ncompetitive tender process, with Rob Topley as the lead audit partner. The\nCommittee confirms that the Group has complied with the Statutory Audit\nServices for Large  \nCompanies Market Investigation (mandatory use of competitive tender processes\nand Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which requires FTSE 350\ncompanies to put their statutory audit services out to tender no less\nfrequently than every  \nten years.  \n  \nNew EU legislation adopted by the UK in 2016 set a maximum audit tenure of 20\nyears and also requires a tender at least every ten years. The new legislation\nis effective for financial periods commencing on or after 17 June 2016.\nAgainst this backdrop, the Group put the external audit contract out for\ntender for the  \n2019 financial year. There are no restrictive contractual provisions limiting\nthe Company's choice of auditor. The next external  \naudit tender is expected to be 2028 for the financial year 2029. A resolution\nto re-appoint Deloitte as auditors will be presented at the AGM.  \n  \nEffectiveness  \n  \n  \nThe Committee assesses the effectiveness of the external audit function on an\nannual basis. In 2019, the review was facilitated through a survey completed\nby members of the Committee, certain Executive Directors and other key\nemployees who had significant interaction with the external audit team during\nthe year. The survey assessed the effectiveness of the lead partner and audit\nteam, the audit approach and execution, the role of management in the audit\nprocess, communication, reporting and support to the Committee as well as the\nindependence and objectivity of the external auditor. The assessment concluded\nthat the external audit process was effective throughout 2019.  \n  \n  \nNon-audit services  \n  \n  \nThe engagement of the external auditor to provide non- audit services to the\nGroup could impact the assessment  \nof its independence and objectivity. The Group has therefore established a\npolicy governing the use of the external auditor for non-audit services. The\npolicy specifies prohibited and approved permitted services and sets the\nframework within which permitted non-audit services may be provided.\nProhibited services comprise activities that are generally perceived to\ninvolve the auditor making judgements or decisions that are the responsibility\nof management.  \n  \nThe Group maintains active relationships with several other large firms and\nany decision to appoint the external auditor for non- audit services is taken\nin the context of its understanding of the Group, which can place it in a\nbetter position than other firms to undertake the work and includes an\nassessment of the cost- effectiveness and practicality of using an alternative\nfirm.  \n  \nThe new EU statutory audit market reform legislation adopted in the UK also\napplies a cap on permissible non-audit services of 70% of the preceding three-\nyear average of audit fees for UK incorporated Public Interest Entities\n(PIEs). This is applicable for financial periods commencing on or after 17\nJune 2019. The  \nchanges in EU law have been directly implemented in the UK by amendments to\nthe Companies Act. The changes will continue to apply despite the UK's exit\nfrom the EU. As a result of the Combination of OSB and CCFS, the new combined\nGroup contains multiple PIEs. Furthermore, where there has been a recent\nchange in auditor, as is the case for OSB, the application of the rules needs\nto be considered carefully for each PIE. For the OSB Group, the rules on\ncapping non-audit services will apply for the first time in 2022 (based on the\naverage audit fees for 2019, 2020  \nand 2021). For the CCFS Group, the rules will apply for the first time in 2020\n(based on the average audit fees for 2017, 2018 and 2019).  \n  \nThe Committee pre-approved a number of permitted services in 2019, including\ninterim profit verifications and the half year review. The Committee also pre-\napproved other permitted non- audit services subject to an overall threshold\nof 50% of the final cost of 2019 Group annual audit services. The Committee,\npost Combination, also reviewed and approved non-audit services provided to\nthe CCFS Group. The Committee regularly reviews  \na schedule of year to date non-audit services. All permitted engagements where\nthe fee is expected to be less than **\u00a3** 25,000 may be approved by the CFO;\nwhere the fee is expected to be above **\u00a3** 25,000 but below **\u00a3** 100,000 it\nmust be approved by  \nthe Chair of the Committee. Engagements over **\u00a3** 100,000 are approved by the\nCommittee.  \n  \nThe OSB and CCFS policies were aligned for 2020 and incorporate the revised\nFRC ethical standard and audit standards effective from March 2020. The policy\nincorporates a whitelist of permitted non-audit services for UK incorporated\nPIEs which primarily  \nrelate to those services required by law and regulation and other assurance\nservices associated with the annual audit or annual report and reporting\naccountant services.  \n  \nThe fees paid to the external auditor in respect of non-audit services during\n2019 totalled **\u00a3** 329,000, representing 16% of 2019  \n  \nGroup audit services of **\u00a3** 2,115,000 (2018: **\u00a3** 135,000 representing 17%\nof 2018 Group audit services of **\u00a3** 814,000) and are detailed in the table\nbelow.  \n  \nFees payable to the Company's auditor for the audit of the Company's annual\naccounts include **\u00a3** 540,000 in respect of the audit of the acquisition date\nbalance sheet and acquisition  \naccounting. Fees payable to the Company's auditor for the audit of the\naccounts of subsidiaries includes **\u00a3** 592,000 in relation to the CCFS year\nend audit and **\u00a3** 65,000 in relation to the audit of Canterbury Finance No.1\nplc. Audit-related assurance services include fees in respect of the interim\nreview and profit verification and include services for CCFS, relating to\nprofit verifications from the date of the Combination. Other assurance\nservices include  \n  \nGroup Audit Committee - key responsibilities  \n  \nInternal Control and Risk Management  \n\\- Review internal financial control systems to identify, assess and monitor\nfinancial risks and other internal control and risk management systems  \n\\- Review and approve systems and controls for the prevention of bribery and\nprocedures for detecting fraud including conduct risk and related activities  \n\\- Review the adequacy and effectiveness of anti-money laundering systems and\ncontrols  \n\\- Review the adequacy and security of the Group's whistleblowing arrangements\nand procedures  \nFinancial Reporting  \n\\- Monitor the integrity of the financial statements, including annual and\ninterim reports, trading updates, Pillar 3 disclosures, and any other formal\nannouncements relating to financial performance  \n\\- Provide challenge and oversight on the consistency, quality and\nappropriateness of significant accounting policies and on the methods used to\naccount for significant or unusual transactions  \n\\- Ensure appropriate accounting standards, estimates and judgements have been\nfollowed, taking into account the view of the external auditor  \n\\- Recommend significant changes to accounting policy to the Board  \n  \nother Combination-related work and agreed upon procedures in respect of\nsecuritisations (2018: review of data submitted to the Bank of England under\nthe Term Funding Scheme and a review of the OSB India financial statements as\nrequired by Indian income tax rules).  \n  \nThe Committee is satisfied that Deloitte is independent. It took into account\nthe non-audit services provided during the year, and confirmations given by\nDeloitte as to its continued independence at various stages in the year.  \n  \nTraining  \n  \n  \nThe Committee undertook training during the year, including making extensive\nuse of the Audit Committee Institute and training programmes run by the major\naccountancy firms. The members  \nof the Committee attended seminars and update meetings held by the FRC. In\naddition, Committee members attended a number of in-house workshops on\nspecific areas. Some members of the Committee also met with key staff during\nthe year to increase their knowledge and understanding of the business.  \n  \nEffectiveness  \n  \n  \nThe Committee formally considers its effectiveness annually.  \nIn 2019, the assessment was facilitated using a survey completed by members of\nthe Committee.

Since the Combination in\nOctober 2019, the composition of the Committee has changed, with Eric Anstee,\nMargaret Hassall,  \nMary McNamara and April Talintyre ceasing to be members. I would like to thank\neach of them for their contributions during their time spent on the Committee.\nTim Brooke, Noel Harwerth and Rajan Kapoor have been appointed as members with\neffect from October 2019 and, along with myself (Graham Allatt) form the\nmembership of the Committee. Tim Brooke will cease to be a member on 7 May\n2020. Only members of the Committee are entitled to attend meetings; however,\nthe Chairman of the Board has a standing invitation to the Committee, along\nwith the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief\nRisk Officers (CROs) and Group Chief Credit Officer (GCCO), unless the\nChairman of the Committee informs any of them that they should not attend a\nparticular meeting or discussion.  \n  \nThe Committee robustly challenged the Group's performance against the Board-\napproved risk appetite, ensuring appropriate and timely consideration was\ngiven to business, economic  \nand regulatory factors impacting the Group's risk profile. The Committee\nmaintained oversight of the Group's Strategic Risk Management Framework (SRMF)\nto ensure that it remained fit for purpose to support the Groups strategic\ngrowth objectives.  \n  \nThe Committee assessed and recommended for approval by the Board, key\nregulatory submissions including the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment\nProcess (ICAAP), the Group Recovery Plan and the Internal Liquidity Adequacy\nAssessment Process (ILAAP). In discharging this responsibility, the Committee\nfocused on risk quantification techniques, underlying assumptions and the\nresulting risk assessment.  \n  \nThe Committee retains oversight of the strategic risk-based initiatives,\nincluding the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) programme, operational resilience\nand the data enhancement programme.  \n  \nFurther information on the role and activities of the Committee is provided in\nthe following Report.  \n  \nGraham Allatt  \nChair of Group Risk Committee  \n19 March 2020  \n  \nResponsibilities  \n  \n  \nThe primary objective of the Committee is to support the Board in discharging\nits risk oversight and governance responsibilities. In particular, the\nCommittee enables the Board to:  \n  \n\\- Set a clear tone from the top in relation to a risk-based culture which\nfosters individual and collective accountability for risk management.  \n\\- Continuously review, challenge and recommend enhancements to the Group's\nSRMF.  \n\\- Ensure adequacy of how the Group organises and resources its risk\nmanagement and oversight functions across the first and second line.  \n\\- Actively assess performance against risk appetite and challenge management\nto ensure that the Board's strategic, business and regulatory objectives are\nnot put at unacceptable levels of risk.  \n  \nThe Committee's specific responsibilities are set out in its terms of\nreference, which are available on the Company's website at www.osb.co.uk.  \n  \nActivity during 2019  \n  \n  \nIn 2019, with oversight from the Committee, the Group continued to enhance and\nfurther integrate its SRMF, which represents the overarching framework\nestablished to manage its risk profile  \nin line with the Board strategy and risk appetite. The detailed overview of\nthe SRMF is provided in the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures.  \nThe key areas of the Committee's focus during 2019 are outlined below.  \n  \nRisk appetite  \n  \n  \nThe Committee played an active role in shaping and assessing the design of the\nGroup's risk appetite in the context of economic and business outlook and\nuncertainties, the strategic growth agenda of the Group and regulatory\ndevelopments. Members of the Committee participated in a risk appetite\nworkshop in which risk appetite statements, risk metrics and guiding limits\nand triggers were discussed and challenged prior to recommendation to the\nBoard for approval. The Committee also ensured that  \nthe proposed risk appetite was subject to appropriate alignment to the Group's\nstrategic agenda, business plans and stress testing capabilities.  \n  \nThe Committee also reviewed the Group's position against risk appetite across\nall principal risks and escalated issues to the Board where appropriate.  \n  \nIRB Programme  \n  \n  \nThe Committee reviewed regular project updates including a detailed plan to\nmerge the OSB and CCFS specific IRB projects which incorporated an approach to\ndevelop and implement enhanced model governance arrangements.  \n  \nCredit risk  \n  \n  \nThe Committee has monitored the performance of the Group loan book on\naggregated and asset class sub-segment levels by assessing the key indicators\nof credit quality, security coverage (including flood risk), affordability and\nborrower risk profile. The Committee also assessed forward-looking credit risk\nindicators in the form of bureau data on customer credit scores, mover alerts\nand indebtedness, business and economic early warning indicators.  \n  \nThe Committee challenged and approved updates to policies including the Group\nLending Policy, the Arrears, Repossessions and Forbearance Policies and the\nLoan Impairment Provisioning Policy. The Committee also exercised oversight\nover credit risk models and provided an appropriate level of challenge in\nrelation to model construction and validation to ensure that the models are\nappropriate and robust. The Committee has also directed management on how to\nmonitor model performance.  \n  \nDuring 2019, the Committee oversaw plans for the alignment of IFRS 9\nmethodologies and approaches across OSB and CCFS.  \nThe Committee also assessed and approved the Group's provision adequacy levels\nthroughout the year.  \n  \nMarket risk and liquidity risk  \n  \n  \nMarket risk and liquidity risk are continually monitored by the Group Assets\nand Liabilities Committee (ALCO) which reports to the Committee. The Committee\nreviewed ALCO's regular assessments of the UK macroeconomic environment and\npotential impacts on the Group's assets and liquidity.  \n  \nThe Committee undertook an extensive assessment of the ILAAP prior to\nsubmission to the Board for approval.  \nKey areas of Committee focus were in relation to scenarios, funding\nassumptions under stress and calibration of liquidity and funding risk\nappetites.  \n  \nSolvency risk and ICAAP  \n  \n  \nThe Committee was involved with the design and approval of appropriate\nmacroeconomic scenarios to be used in the Group's ICAAP. The ICAAP\ndemonstrates how the Group would manage its business and capital during\nadverse macroeconomic and idiosyncratic stresses. The Committee assessed the\nresults of all the risk-based capital assessments and stress testing before\nfinally recommending the full ICAAP document to the Board  \nfor approval.  \n  \nThe Committee also reviewed and challenged the Group Capital Plan and\nmonitored total capital and CET1 forecasts throughout the year, ensuring risks\nwere understood and managed appropriately.  \n  \nThe Committee additionally started to consider moving towards a combined ICAAP\nfor OSB and CCFS and sought external advice on the best approach to alignment.  \n  \nGroup Risk Committee Report continued  \n  \nOperational risk  \n  \n  \nThe Committee received reports on operational risks at each of its meetings.\nThe reports covered risk incidents that had arisen to allow the Committee to\nassess management's response and remedial action proposed. The reports also\ncovered key risk indicators (KRIs), which can be quantitative or qualitative\nand provided insights regarding changes in the Group's operational risk\nprofile.  \n  \nThe Committee requested a detailed analysis of operational incidents occurring\nduring the course of 2019 to further understand any causes and trends. The\nCommittee was satisfied that the actions taken were appropriate and that the\ncontrol  \nof operational incidents continued to improve.  \n  \nA full programme of operational resilience testing was undertaken throughout\nthe year, including a Board-level disaster recovery  \ntest simulation which was externally-facilitated and constructive feedback was\nprovided.  \n  \nCompliance and regulatory risk  \n  \n  \nThe Committee received reports covering compliance and financial crime KRIs,\nwhich can be quantitative or qualitative  \nand provide insights regarding changes in the Group's compliance and\nregulatory risk profile. The Committee also assessed and recommended\nenhancements to the compliance and financial crime risk appetite before\nrecommending it for approval by  \nthe Board.  \n  \nRisk Management Framework integration  \n  \n  \nThe Committee considered the Combination Integration Plan and harmonisation of\nthe Risk Management Frameworks and functions of OSB and CCFS. An external firm\nassisted the Group with the creation of the Integration Plan which sets out\nthe key components of the respective firms' frameworks. The scope of all\ncomponents is broken down into three distinct groupings, namely; business as\nusual, regulatory requirements and risk projects and sets out a summary of\nworkstreams and timelines to achieve harmonisation.  \n  \nOther risk types  \n  \n  \nThe Committee reviewed the Group profiles of conduct risk, reputational risk,\nclimate change risk and business and strategic risk against their respective\nrisk appetites.  \n  \nRecovery Plan  \n  \nThe Recovery Plan process is designed to ensure that in a time of stress the\nGroup has a credible recovery plan that can be implemented in a timely manner.\nThe Committee reviewed and commented on the proposed set of recovery options\nwithin its plan.  \n  \nGroup Risk Committee - key responsibilities Risk appetite and assessment  \n\\- Advise the Board on overall risk appetite, tolerance and strategy  \n\\- Review risk assessment processes that inform the Board's decision-making  \n\\- Consider the Group's capability to identify and manage new risks  \n\\- Advise the Board on proposed strategic transactions, including acquisitions\nor disposals, ensuring risk aspects and implications for risk appetite and\ntolerance are considered  \nRisk monitoring and framework  \n\\- Review credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, market risk,\ncompliance and regulatory risks, solvency risk, conduct risk, reputational\nrisk and operational risk exposures by reference to risk appetite  \n\\- Challenge and endorse the SRMF  \n\\- Provide challenge and oversight to the ICAAP framework  \n\\- Monitor actual and forecast risk and regulatory capital positions  \n\\- Recommend changes to capital utilisation  \n\\- Provide challenge and oversight to the ILAAP framework  \n\\- Monitor the actual and forecast liquidity position  \n\\- Review reports on risk appetite thresholds, identify where a risk of a\nmaterial breach of risk limits exists and ensure proposed actions are adequate  \n\\- Provide challenge and oversight to the Recovery Plan framework  \nCROs and risk governance structure  \n\\- Consider and approve the remit of the Risk function  \n\\- Recommend to the Board the appointment and removal of the CROs  \n\\- Review promptly all reports from the CROs  \n\\- Review and monitor management's responsiveness to the findings of the CROs  \n\\- Receive reports from the ALCO and the Risk Management Committees  \n  \nOther Committees  \nGroup Models and Ratings Committee  \nFollowing the Combination, the Group Models and Ratings Committee was\nestablished as a sub-committee of the Group Risk Committee in January 2020.\nThe primary purpose of the Committee is to act as the designated Committee for\nthe purpose of material aspects of the rating and estimation processes  \n(as articulated in Article 189 of the EU Capital Requirements Regulation) and\nprovide assurance of the Group's models and ratings systems. The Committee is\nchaired by the Chair of the Group Risk Committee, Graham Allatt. Rajan Kapoor\nand April Talintyre are members of the Committee.  \n  \nBoard Integration Committee  \nThe Board Integration Committee was established in October 2019, following the\nCombination with CCFS. The primary objective of the Committee is to oversee\nplanning and execution of the integration of OSB and CCFS, including oversight\nof synergies realisation. David Weymouth has been appointed as Chair of the\nCommittee, with Andy Golding, Margaret Hassall, Sarah Hedger and Rajan Kapoor\nas members.

Doing so goes a long way to ensuring business growth and success.\n\nFor some, that translates to a new technology or a new strategy surrounding a\ntechnology the workforce is using.  While that's true, it is but a piece of a\nmuch larger puzzle.  The same can be said about the relationship between the\nemployee and employer and any number of strategies that could be mentioned.\n\nIn reality, what HR is looking for is an employee engagement strategy that\ndelivers the best results possible.\n\n# Employee Engagement in 2020\n\nThe hardest part for HR to achieve in defining and implementing an employee\nengagement strategy is trying to find that emotional \"glue\" that connects the\nemployee to the company. The problem is it's a different type of \"glue\" for\nevery organization and every person in the organization.  What connects one\nperson to the company and motivates that person to do their best may not be\nthe same \"glue\" for a co-worker.\n\nAdditionally, events happening all over the world have some bearing on the\nstrategy as well.\n\nEmployee engagement itself isn't a \"check-box\" item HR can simply say it's\ndone because they've completed a series of objections.  It changes constantly\nand HR has to change with it.\n\n## Stats to Know\n\nThe strategy isn't the only thing that's changing.  So too is the data\nsurrounding employee engagement.  Some of the larger points to consider\ninclude:\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/employee_engagement_in_2020_statistics.jpg)\n\n## Employee Engagement Strategies\n\nIt's not enough to know the information and data presented above.  HR has to\ntake action.  Below are a series of strategies to consider when looking to\nbetter the employee engagement strategy at any given company.  As with the\ntopic itself, these strategies are not applicable in all organizations or\nindustries.\n\n### Employees First\n\n> \"Clients do not come first.  Employees come first.  If you take care of your\n> employees, they will take care of the clients.\"\n\nNo doubt that is a familiar phrase.  It was said by Sir Richard Branson, the\nowner of the Virgin Group.  It can be a hard pill to swallow for most, but\nfrom an employee engagement perspective it is very true.\n\nThink about it for a moment.\n\nEvery business is focused on making sure their clients are satisfied, not only\nwith the customer service, but the product as well.  That gets increasingly\nmore difficult if your employees aren't connected to the company and the\nproduct.  If the employees aren't giving their best, what makes the leaders\nthink they are going to do their best in selling the product or be brand\nambassadors for the business?  A few years ago, that might have been the case,\nbut as more and more millennials enter the workforce, not to mention\nGeneration Z, that's changed.  Pay isn't as important as it once was.\n\nEngaging with employees becomes significantly important here.  That engagement\ncan take the form of employee development that supports growth.  It can also\ntake the form of feedback.  Listening to employees can serve a company well.\nNot only does it allow for the discovery of potential problems, but it allows\na company the ability to gain insight from employees about how to better the\nproduct, business process, or overall communication to name a few.\n\n### Recognition\n\n> \"Everyone wants to be appreciated, so if you appreciate someone, don't keep\n> it a secret.\"\n\nThat was uttered by Mary Kay Ash, the founder of Mary Kay Cosmetics.  It's\nsimple, but recognition, especially of an employee by a manager/leader, goes a\nlong way.\n\nThis plays into the need of the employee to know the organization is paying\nattention and investing in them. It also does a lot in the way of motivating\nemployees.  A strong and trusted rewards and recognition program creates one\nof the reason employees need to succeed.  When employees succeed, so too does\nthe company.\n\nRELATED:  [Parkland CXO Talks Rewards\nTechnology](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-tech/articles/parkland-cxo-\ntalks-rewards-technology)\n\n### Work-Life Balance\n\nEvery HR professional has experienced a tightening of the budget in their\ncareers.  That usually means HR teams are unable to put funds toward\npurchasing the latest technology or tools to help better the employee\nengagement strategy.\n\nBut is there a cost-friendly way to go about it?  Yes.\n\nThis is where flexibility comes into the mix.  It's been on the minds of HR\nprofessionals for some time, but only within the last few years has it started\nto become a fully-realized strategy.  Among millennials and Generation Z\nworkers, flexibility is the main driver behind finding the [work-life\nbalance](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/news/12-work-\nlife-balance-tips) so many seek.\n\nThe data supports that claim.\n\n75% of workers, according to FlexJob, say they are more productive at home.\nThere are fewer distractions, less stress as it relates to traveling to and\nfrom work, and the avoidance of office politics.\n\n### Diversity & Inclusion\n\nAt first glance, it may be difficult to see how [diversity and\ninclusion](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/articles/what-diversity-looks-like-in-the-workplace) fits in to the\nlarger employee engagement strategy.  Naturally, it feels like more of a\nrecruitment/talent acquisition strategy than an engagement strategy.\n\nWhile that may have been the case years ago, it's not now especially as more\nand more workers are looking to their employer to be more socially conscious.\nTake [Generation Z](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/articles/rise-of-generation-z-what-hr-should-know) for instance.\nAccording to Allegis Group, 82% of Generation Z workers consider an\norganization's corporate social responsibility, or CSR, a major factor when\ndeciding where to work.  Furthermore, 66% would take a pay cut to work for a\nmore socially responsible company.  In other words:  if the organization is\nnot embracing diversity and inclusion, it can lead to a disconnect between\nemployees and potential job candidates and the company.\n\nAdditionally, a diverse and inclusive workforce has major benefits to an\norganization.  It allows for employees to bring different ideas and solution\nto the table.  All of these are informed by their backgrounds and other\ndimensions of diversity.  This feedback is critical especially when measuring\nthe impact of engagement across the board.\n\n### Wellness\n\n[Wellness](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-compensation-\nbenefits/articles/how-to-maximize-the-value-of-wellness-incentive-pr) is\nsomething that will be huge in the next year and it will become a great\nengagement tool.\n\nAdults spend a lot of their waking time at work.  It makes sense that if a\nperson is healthy in all aspects their ability to work is far improved and the\ncompany benefits.  Health has a direct correlation with employee productivity\nand performance levels.  In fact, a Global Corporate Challenge study says\nhappier employees are more productive at work.\n\n#### Mental Health\n\nIn addition to wellness, mental health will continue to be a high priority for\nHR professionals in 2020.  It can have a major impact on the employee\nengagement strategy within an organization.\n\nPoor mental health causes a loss of 70 million working days every year\naccording to PMLiVE.  Additionally, there are a number of surveys and case\nstudies available showing the negative impact of mental illness on an\norganization and their continued ability to engage employees.\n\nAs companies start and continue to embrace mental health initiatives in the\nworkplace, employees will be increasingly connected to the company and each\nother.\n\n## In Summation\n\nThere any number of strategies that have a positive impact on employee\nengagement within a company.  At the end of the day, the focus is really on\nmaking sure the employee feels supported by the organization.  When the\nemployee feels connected and supported, there will be increases in her/his\nproductivity and the company will feel the impact.  But it's more than just a\nfinancial impact.  Companies who embrace employee engagement will see lower\nturnover rates and will see the creation of more \"forever employees\".  No\nmatter how HR looks at it, employee engagement is a win-win for the\norganization, one that requires a lot of continuous work.  The pay-off is\nworth it in the end.\n\n\n\n> NEXT:  [Future of Work - The Definitive\n> Guide](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/articles/the-\n> definitive-guide-to-the-future-of-work)\n\n\n\n_Photo courtesy:   Pexels_\n\n##  Upcoming Events  __\n\n[\n\n##### Future HR week\n\n](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/events-\nhrtransformationasia/?mac=HRIQ_ArticleDetail_EOI_Title_Listing&utm_medium=Portal&utm_source=hr-\nexchange-network)\n\n27 -

The majority of employees are toiling away at their job,\nunengaged and lacking motivation due to the absence of a strong sense of\npurpose. According to research by Gallup, the majority\n([51%](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-\nsatisfaction.aspx)) of US workers do not feel engaged at work. Gallup has\ndubbed the state of affairs an \"employee engagement crisis\u201d\u2014and for good\nreason. Highly engaged business units realize a[\n21%](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-employee-\nsatisfaction.aspx) improvement in profitability. Engagement also has a\nsignificant impact on employee retention, with highly engaged employees being[\n87%](https://www.stcloudstate.edu/humanresources/_files/documents/supv-brown-\nbag/employee-engagement.pdf) less likely to leave their companies. Given these\nlucrative upshots, it's no surprise that employee engagement is one of the\nbiggest challenges confronting businesses. To tackle the problem, many\nforward-thinking companies are turning to AI.\n\n**Real-time feedback  **\n\nFar too often, organizations and HR departments rely on \"pulse\" engagement\nsurveys, often conducted on an annual or quarterly basis to assess engagement.\nTypically known for being lengthy and mundane, these surveys neither stimulate\nnor excite employees, squashing the odds of motivating the most thoughtful\nresponses. What's more, the surveys' strong reliance on scaled responses (for\nexample, \"neutral\", \"agree\", \"strongly agree\" ratings) tend to be difficult to\ninterpret and have limited use in terms of unearthing deep insights.\nMoreover, given the fact that HR professionals spend weeks interpreting the\ndata and delivering it to employees, results quickly become lagging indicators\nthat fail to reveal the current state of affairs.\n\nAI can move waters in terms of gauging employee engagement in real time. AI is\nable to leverage natural language processing and sentiment analysis to unearth\nemployee morale and engagement. What types of language phrases do employees\nuse in text-based conversations such as email? What types of emojis do they\nuse on platforms such as Slack? These factors are revealing. Consider[\nKeen](http://www.keencorp.com/), a platform that sifts through employees\u2019\nanonymized emails and uses sentiment analysis to serve up a real-time snapshot\nof engagement.\n\nAI even has the potential to assess biometric data\u2014fingerprints, eye scans,\nand similar data\u2014to assess engagement.  This data empowers HR professionals to\nengage in swift action and surface the type of personalized recommendations\nthat could never be gleaned from traditional annual engagement surveys.\n\nToday In: [Entrepreneurs](https://www.forbes.com/entrepreneurs/older)\n\n  * [\n\n### How This Instagram-Centric Brand Successfully Attracts Gen Z: A Case Study\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shamahyder/2020/04/06/how-this-instagram-\ncentric-brand-successfully-attracts-gen-z-a-case-study/)\n\n  * [\n\n### How Grief Can Fuel The Entrepreneurial Spirit During The Coronavirus\nCrisis\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhall/2020/04/05/how-grief-can-fuel-the-\nentrepreneurial-spirit-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Remote Working: What It Means For RPA (Robotic Process Automation)\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2020/04/04/remote-working-what-it-\nmeans-for-rpa-robotic-process-automation/)\n\n **Learning and development  **\n\nOrganizations that provide employees with compelling and impactful learning\nand development opportunities have a leg up on their peers. Millennials have\nan especially strong desire for learning and development opportunities. A\nstaggering[ 87%](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/191435/millennials-\nwork-life.aspx) of Millennials state that professional development or career\ngrowth opportunities are very important. Moreover,[\n40%](https://www.go2hr.ca/training-development/employee-training-is-worth-the-\ninvestment) of employees who don\u2019t receive sufficient job training\nsubsequently leave their positions within the first year.\n\nAI has unprecedented potential to offer targeted and personalized\nrecommendations in terms of learning and development.  AI is able to pinpoint\nwhich employees have the potential, based on hard and soft skills and\nmotivational factors, to advance to specific leadership positions. AI is then\nable to suggest optimal learning that can help employees advance and reach new\nheights.\n\n**Team composition  **\n\nResearch has revealed that the time spent by managers and employees in\ncollaborative activities has ballooned by[\n50%](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload) or more in the past two\ndecades. Strong performance in any work setting depends on collaboration. Too\noften, teams are formed with little thought as to skillets, motivational\nfactors, and previous performance. Workers have different work styles and this\nneeds to be accounted for when forming teams. Effective collaboration pays\nenormous dividends. Research has shown that companies that promote\ncollaborative working are[ five\ntimes](https://www.i4cp.com/member/restricted?referer=%2Fsurvey-\nanalyses%2Fpurposeful-collaboration-the-essential-components-of-collaborative-\ncultures) as likely to be high performing.\n\nAI can also be a powerful force in assessing employee motivation and\nleveraging results to determine optimal team composition. Already, AI can\ndetermine what specific factors motivate specific employees and inform\nmanagers as to how to best motivate teams.[ Attuned](https://www.attuned.ai/),\nfor example, uncovers the motivational factors impacting employees. The\ncompany has isolated 11 motivational factors that drive work culture,\nincluding altruism, autonomy, and competition.\n\nEngagement is top-of-mind for all recruiters and companies must feel compelled\nto double down on their focus on AI as it relates to employee engagement. But\nAI adoption and embracement should not be taken lightly. Especially in the\ncase of engagement, tools must be evaluated with a critical eye towards\nprivacy concerns, biases, and effectiveness. Most importantly, employees\nshould be part of the conversation in terms of whether these tools ought to be\npart of their workplace milieu.\n\n\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/falonfatemi) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/falon).

Just a few minutes of face time can renew the sense of\nconnection you feel to your team, but you have to be willing to turn on your\ncamera, and that isn\u2019t always easy. For starters, you have to look\nprofessional (at least from the waist up), as does your environment. What is\nin the background of your shot?

Watercooler chatter, a\nworkplace ritual once taken for granted, is suddenly a distant memory, as are\nbreak-room coffees and good-night wishes at the end of a long day.

Yet asking the right [employee\nengagement](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/3-keys-to-employee-\nengagement-measurement) questions is key. You can write these survey questions\nwith the help of someone who specializes in a domain such as organizational\npsychology or data science.\n\nHere are some things to consider as you think of your engagement survey\nstrategy.\n\n### __Prepare survey questions\n\nThe right structure is critical to getting the most informative results. For\nan employee engagement survey, you should group questions into two sets,\nfollowed by a set that allows respondents to write open-ended answers. The\nfirst set of questions should focus on measuring respondents' engagement and\nexperience, while the second set of questions should focus on measuring the\n[overall employee\nexperience](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/10-ingredients-in-\na-killer-employee-experience-strategy) and discovering what drives engagement.\nTypically, surveys should be no longer than 40 questions, or respondents may\nget fatigued.\n\n> If your questions are vague, it may create responses that are not accurate\n> and therefore unusable.  __\n\nMake sure to construct the surveys so that each question focuses on just one\ntopic or subject and then phrase the questions so they mean the same thing to\nall respondents. If your questions are vague, it may create responses that are\nnot accurate and therefore unusable.\n\nFor example, a question might be \"Do you find your work interesting?\" Since\n\"interesting\" may mean something different to different employees, this may\nelicit a \"no\" response. An alternative question could be, \"What aspects of\nyour work do you find the most fulfilling?\"\n\n### __Figure out question themes\n\nQuestions can cover a variety of themes, and for an engagement survey these\nquestions would typically be part of one of the following themes:\n\n  * **Collaboration:** Can employees work together easily? Can they access and share information with each other and with other teams?\n  * **Career development:** What are the career growth and development opportunities?\n  * **Communication:** Is corporate communication sufficient, meaningful and regular enough?\n  * **Diversity and inclusion:** Do employees feel included and accepted in the company?\n  * **Leadership:** Do employees have confidence and trust in company leadership and senior management?\n  * **Performance and accountability:** Do [people understand their personal goals](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/tip/Continuous-performance-management-comes-with-benefits-drawbacks) and understand where they fit into corporate goals? Are there clear expectations on what is required of them in their role?\n  * **Strategic alignment:** Do employees understand the goals and direction of the company? Do they understand how their work contributes to the success of the company?\n\nThis list is not exhaustive and there may be other themes that are specific to\nyour company.\n\n### __Create the format\n\nThere are a multitude of different questions that you can ask employees to\nunderstand their overall experience. It's not just the question that is\nimportant, but also what you allow for a response. In some instances, you\nmight want a yes or no answer, while in other instances a scale from 1 to 10\nmight be more suitable. Try to avoid too many open-ended or free-text\nquestions, as [these can be hard to\ncollate](https://buildingchanges.org/coordinated-entry-toolkit/data-\ncollection/data-collection-challenges-and-tips) for a large pool of\nrespondents.\n\n### __Begin the survey\n\nHere are a few questions that you should use to get the most helpful feedback.\n\n  1. How happy are you at work?\n  2. How valued do you feel?\n  3. Do you feel that your goals and objectives are clear?\n  4. Do you feel that your work makes a meaningful contribution?\n  5. Do you have a clearly defined career path?\n  6. Do you feel that you receive adequate training?\n  7. Do you see yourself working here in one year's time?\n  8. Would you apply for this job again?\n  9. Would you recommend the company to friends or family?\n  10. Do you receive adequate and meaningful recognition for your achievements?\n  11. How suitable are the software applications that you use for your work?\n  12. Do you have everything you need to do complete your work tasks sufficiently?\n  13. Do you feel able to give feedback?\n  14. Do you feel that feedback that you provide is acted upon?\n  15. How do you feel about your work-life balance?\n\nAll of these questions \\-- except the last question \\-- are closed questions,\nmeaning the response would be either yes/no or on a rating scale (e.g. 1 to 5\nor 0 to 10). You can also modify these questions to include the rating scale.\nFor example, \"How happy are you at work?\" could also be \"On a scale of 1 to 5,\nhow happy are you at work?\"\n\n####  __Dig Deeper on People analytics software\n\n  * [\n\n##### How to use Qualtrics employee experience tool to gather feedback\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/marson_luke.jpg) By: Luke\nMarson ](https://searchsap.techtarget.com/feature/How-to-use-Qualtrics-\nemployee-experience-tool-to-gather-feedback)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Government shutdown may sink workplace engagement, hike turnover\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau\n](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252455747/Government-shutdown-\nmay-sink-workplace-engagement-hike-turnover)\n\n  * [\n\n##### New employee engagement tools replacing annual surveys\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/New-\nemployee-engagement-tools-replacing-annual-surveys)\n\n  * [\n\n##### Workplace engagement yields employee diversity and inclusion\n\n![](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineImages/thibodeau_patrick.jpg) By:\nPatrick Thibodeau ](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Workplace-\nengagement-yields-employee-diversity-and-inclusion)\n\n__Sponsored News\n\n  * [Making an Intelligent Workspace a Part of Your Everyday Reality](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/Making-an-Intelligent-Workspace-a-Part-of-Your-Everyday-Reality) -Citrix\n  * [Microapps Empower the Modern Workforce](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/Microapps-Empower-the-Modern-Workforce) -Citrix\n  * [How IT and HR can Partner to Deliver a Better Employee Experience](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/futureofwork/How-IT-and-HR-can-Partner-to-Deliver-a-Better-Employee-Experience) -Citrix\n  * [See More](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/sponsored_communities)\n\n__Related Content\n\n  * [Three ways the employee Net Promoter Score is an HR ...](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/Three-ways-the-employee-Net-Promoter-Score-is-an-HR-supertool) - SearchHRSoftware\n  * [employee pulse survey](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/employee-pulse-survey) - WhatIs.com\n  * [New HR tools probe employee sentiment, feelings](https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/feature/New-HR-tools-probe-employee-sentiment-feelings) - SearchHRSoftware\n\n####  __Start the conversation\n\n###  __ 0 comments\n\nSend me notifications when other members comment.

employee\nengagement. But it starts from the top. Leadership must be fully committed to\nmaking it work.\n\nFebruary 12, 2020\n\n![Written by Workforce Partnership Staff](/-/media/images/workforce-blog-\nimages/wp-staff-author-\nicon.png?w=100&modified=20191125180333&hash=C66BF4DEF00D340A8BFFBB4A9A0D1CB4E3EDB87F)\n\nWorkforce Partnership Staff  \n\n[ Link to SNHU Facebook ](https://www.facebook.com/SNHU) [ Link to SNHU\nTwitter ](https://twitter.com/snhu) [ Link to SNHU Instagram\n](https://www.instagram.com/snhu/)\n\n[Explore Programs](/program-finder)\n\nBy establishing a culture of learning -- an environment in which individual\ngrowth is actively encouraged -- businesses can help employees feel more\nengaged at work, which has a real effect on the bottom line. [Engaged\nemployees are more committed](https://www.snhu.edu/about-\nus/newsroom/2019/05/snhu-designs-for-employee-engagement) to their\norganizations, leading to greater productivity and higher net profit. Building\na culture of learning, however, requires leadership to be fully engaged as\nwell.\n\n### Why Engagement Matters\n\nOnly 29% of employees are fully engaged, according to a survey by[ Dale\nCarnegie Training and MSW\nResearch](https://www.dalecarnegie.ca/resources/what-drives-employee-\nengagement-and-why-it-matters/). That leaves 45% only partially engaged and\n26% actively disengaged. Those numbers can have a devastating effect on the\nbusiness -- if your people are either phoning it in or have basically checked\nout, everything from morale to profits will inevitably suffer.\n\nBusinesses with high employee engagement reap a host of benefits. These\ninclude reduced absenteeism, turnover and shrinkage; fewer quality defects and\nsafety incidents; and higher customer metrics, according to the[ 2017 Gallup\nState of the American\nWorkplace](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/238085/state-american-workplace-\nreport-2017.aspx#) report.\n\nThey also boast 17% better productivity, 20% higher sales, and 21% greater\nprofitability. Meanwhile, Gallup estimates that actively disengaged employees\n-- who create what is often termed \"presenteeism\" -- cost the U.S. $483\nbillion to $605 billion each year in lost productivity.\n\n### What Drives Engagement\n\nJosh Bersin, a thought leader in human resources and talent management,\n[writes in the _Deloitte Review_](https://dupress.deloitte.com/dup-us-\nen/deloitte-review/issue-16/employee-engagement-strategies.html) about five\nelements that drive engagement: meaningful work, hands-on management, a\npositive work environment, growth opportunity, and trust in leadership.\n\nAccording to[ employment studies](http://www.employment-studies.co.uk/report-\nsummaries/report-summary-drivers-employee-engagement) in the U.K., employees\nwho had personal development plans and received formal performance appraisals\nwithin the past year had significantly higher engagement levels. The Gallup\nreport found that 60% of workers think being able to do what they do best has\nthe greatest impact on their level of engagement.\n\nBut more significantly, 70% of those who lack confidence in senior leadership,\naccording to [Dale Carnegie\nTraining](https://www.dalecarnegie.com/en/resources/employee-engagement-\nmaking-engagement-a-daily-priority-for-leaders), were not fully engaged.\n\nFor employers looking to boost engagement, the upshot of this should be clear:\nA culture of learning requires leaders who are themselves engaged and visibly\ncommitted to the continuing development of their employees.\n\n### Why Leaders Need to Be Learning Catalysts\n\nA culture of learning starts at the top. Companies can't simply talk about the\nimportance of education; they must actively support growth and development of\nall employees at all levels, beginning with managers. According to the Gallup\nreport, employees are 59% more likely to be engaged if they are supervised by\nhighly engaged managers.\n\nManagers who understand what is at stake and are fully invested in the culture\nof learning can support engagement in a variety of ways. Assigning projects\ngeared to an employee's strengths, giving employees time to work on their\ndevelopment, and [actively encouraging them to pursue higher\neducation](https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/2019/02/supporting-\nalternative-pathways-to-learning-for-adult-students) are particularly\neffective. Good managers can also model learning behaviors by taking time out\nfor those activities themselves.\n\n### Why Learning Matters\n\nOne highly impactful driver of employee engagement is aligning individual and\ncorporate goals. Businesses can achieve this by actively equipping employees\nto meet key performance metrics, learn new skills to better perform their\njobs, or access opportunities for higher education that position them for\nadvancement.\n\nMany organizations already encourage employees to set performance or\ndevelopment goals during their annual review process, but [too few actually\nprovide the resources and support](https://www.snhu.edu/about-\nus/newsroom/2018/10/learning-programs-inspiring-employees) to achieve them.\nSuch support includes dedicated time to work on goals, regularly checking in\non progress, and assigning projects and tasks that reinforce learning.\n\nStudies show that workers are eager to learn. A [2019 CareerBuilder/Harris\nPoll survey](http://press.careerbuilder.com/2019-07-23-Survey-from-\nCareerBuilder-Reveals-Half-of-Employees-Feel-They-Have-Just-a-Job-Amid-\nHeightened-Career-Expectations) reported that 73% of employees whose companies\ndo not currently offer learning opportunities outside work hours would likely\nparticipate if they were available. And a startling 70% of those [surveyed by\nGartner](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/motivate-employees-to-\nreskill-for-the-digital-age/) said that not only do they feel unequipped for\ntheir job's future needs, but they don't even possess the skills currently\nrequired.\n\n### It's Never Too Early to Start\n\nFor many companies, the problem starts on day one. When [an employee\nengagement survey conducted for the Society for Human Resource Management by\nRandstad and Ipsos Public\nAffairs](https://www.shrm.org/foundation/ourwork/initiatives/resources-from-\npast-initiatives/pages/engaging-your-employees.aspx) asked 3,000 workers which\npractices were most effective in keeping them engaged, top responses included\ninvesting in their careers through training, professional development, or\ncontinuing education.\n\nAnd yet, [a survey by Execu-Search](https://www.execu-search.com/employer-\nresources/infographic/strategies-engage-empower-employees) found that 50% of\nworkers believe they did not receive sufficient training when they started a\nnew position.\n\nThe need for education and development opportunities is becoming even more\ncrucial as millennials make up a higher percentage of the workforce. The State\nof the American Workplace Report report from Gallup also found that 87% of\nmillennials rate \"professional or career growth and development opportunities\"\nas important. Yet only 39% strongly agree they have learned something new in\nthe past 30 days that could enable them to do their job better.\n\nDespite their desire to learn, workers face hurdles such as disinterested\nemployers, overwhelming workloads, and fear of debt. Organizations can remove\nthese roadblocks by offering [tuition assistance](https://www.snhu.edu/about-\nus/newsroom/2019/03/better-tap-participation) and career coaching.\n\n### Monitoring Engagement Levels\n\nMany employers use surveys to assess engagement levels. While these can be\nvaluable, a true culture of learning needs more than an annual questionnaire.\nThe key to measuring employee engagement is ongoing and open communication\nbetween teams and their leaders.\n\nFrequent feedback from management lets people know that someone values their\nwork. Engaged managers become effective coaches who guide and inspire\nemployees to be the best that they can be, while balancing the expectations of\nboth employee and company.\n\nBy viewing employee engagement with the same constant focus as customer\nservice, organizations can see real results in their yearly engagement surveys\nand, just as importantly, on their bottom line.\n\n[Workforce Development](/about-us/newsroom/categories/workforce-development)\n\n### Explore more content like this article\n\n![Lisa Urban, phd, msn, rn, associate chief nursing\nadministrator](/-/media/images/blog-image/lisa-\nurban.png?h=440&la=en&w=440&modified=20200319171853&hash=134D40BB4492C51BA0B046F3E8C1FD8B120CD823)\n\n[\n\n##  The Nursing Workforce of the Future\n\n](/about-us/newsroom/2020/04/the-nursing-workforce-of-the-future)\n\nApril 02, 2020\n\n  \n\nAn interview with Associate Chief Nursing Administrator Lisa Urban at SNHU\nabout how higher education and employers work together to build the nursing\nworkforce.\n\n![A nurse educator overlooking the work of another\nnurse.](/-/media/images/blog-image/nursing-\nshortage.jpg?h=440&la=en&w=440&modified=20200305151647&hash=4B7CD2497CA59BBCB5CC4C1BBF8A37ACA122709A)\n\n[\n\n##  How the Nurse Educator Shortage Is Holding Back Healthcare\n\n](/about-us/newsroom/2020/03/how-the-nurse-educator-shortage-is-holding-back-\nhealthcare)\n\nMarch 05, 2020\n\n  \n\nSeveral indicators point to a shortage in nurse educators but what are the\nimplications for the future of the healthcare workforce?\n\n![man touching a computer screen that is displaying medical\ninformation](/-/media/images/blog-image/nursing-\ntechnology-440x440.jpg?h=440&la=en&w=440&modified=20200227153352&hash=958375E94F842477F043B32B5976678335CC1FE6)\n\n[\n\n##  What Healthcare Professionals Need to Know About AI in 2020\n\n](/about-us/newsroom/2020/02/what-healthcare-professionals-need-to-know-about-\nai-in-2020)\n\nFebruary 28, 2020\n\n  \n\nTo prepare for the coming revolution, healthcare professionals need to\nunderstand the new benefits, risks and challenges of AI.

One reason is\nthat most companies are actually attempting to tackle way too many issues.\n\nImagine that you\u2019ve just conducted an employee engagement survey with 14\nquestions. And further imagine that your company got low scores on seven of\nthem.\n\nThe typical company will think, \u201cOkay, I guess we need to go fix those seven\nissues.\u201d And thus the problems begin.\n\nThink about the priorities of the typical manager. They\u2019ve got to achieve\nprofitability, quality, customer satisfaction, productivity and whatever other\nmetrics the company throws at them. Then they have to resolve conflicts, hire\nnew staff, conduct performance reviews, manage low performers, assign tasks\nand the list goes on.\n\nGiven all these priorities, where does employee engagement fall on the to-do\nlist for most managers? Somewhere near the bottom, if it appears at all. And\nnow we want those managers to fix seven different issues? It\u2019s never going to\nhappen.\n\n**Statistically, There\u2019s Always One Issue That\u2019s More Important Than The\nOthers**\n\nAsking leaders to address too many issues is doomed to fail because if you\nattempt everything you\u2019ll achieve nothing. But there\u2019s also another bit of\nfallacious reasoning at work here.\n\nYour company has a few stakeholders or customers that are just way more\nimportant than everyone else. (In fact, most companies would actually benefit\nfrom firing some of their least important and least profitable customers). And\nthe same logic applies when it comes to employee engagement survey questions.\n\nA few weeks ago, I ran a statistical analysis on the employee engagement\nsurvey data from a mid-size financial firm. And I discovered that 57% of their\nemployees\u2019 loyalty was driven by one issue: whether employees felt comfortable\nsharing work problems with their boss.\n\nLast week, researchers at a hospital ran a similar analysis and discovered\nthat 61% of their employees\u2019 engagement could be explained by one issue:\nwhether performance reviews were open and honest.\n\nAnd a few days ago, I learned that 54% of a tech company\u2019s employee engagement\nwas driven by one issue: whether employees would have to learn new skills to\nachieve their annual goals.\n\nThe point of this is simple:  [You can quickly find 1-2 issues that are\nexponentially more important than all the other employee engagement\nissues.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fmarkmurphy%2F2019%2F05%2F16%2Fironically-\nyour-employee-engagement-survey-may-be-failing-because-youre-tackling-too-\nmany-\nissues%2F&text=You%20can%20quickly%C2%A0find%201-2%20issues%20that%20are%20exponentially%20more%20important%20than%20all%20the%20other%20employee%20engagement%20issues.)\n\nIf 55% of my employees\u2019 loyalty is driven by whether they understand the\ncompany\u2019s vision, why would I spend time on trying to fix any other issue? I\ncould prioritize all of my efforts on tackling this one thing and experience\nfar greater improvement than pursuing even a dozen other issues.\n\n**With Machine Learning (Or Advanced Statistics) You Can Ask Lots Of\nQuestions**\n\nIn the aforementioned examples, the way we discovered the big issue that\ndrives employee engagement was through a combination of machine learning and\n[multiple regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis). And\nbecause these technologies are so pervasive these days, there\u2019s really no\nreason for companies to pursue improving seven issues when improving one would\nsuffice.\n\nThese technologies also mean that you don\u2019t need to worry about asking too\nmany questions on your survey. Yes, you certainly need to worry about trying\nto fix too many issues, but you can ask two or three dozen questions and be\nperfectly fine.\n\nWhy? Because as soon as you have all the data from your survey, you run it\nthrough a multiple regression and immediately discover the one or two issues\nthat are exponentially more important than everything else. And that\u2019s where\nyou\u2019ll focus all of your improvement efforts.\n\nI see too many companies worry about the number of questions on their surveys\nand not nearly enough worry about the number of task forces they create after\nthe survey. And that\u2019s just completely backwards.\n\n[You can ask dozens of questions on your survey, as long as you only try to\ntake action on a few of\nthem.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fmarkmurphy%2F2019%2F05%2F16%2Fironically-\nyour-employee-engagement-survey-may-be-failing-because-youre-tackling-too-\nmany-\nissues%2F&text=You%20can%20ask%20dozens%20of%20questions%20on%20your%20survey%2C%20as%20long%20as%20you%20only%20try%20to%20take%20action%20on%20a%20few%20of%20them.)\nAnd ideally, the ones you\u2019re acting on are the ones that will have the biggest\nimpact on engaging your employees.\n\nWith 78% of companies failing to get good results on their employee engagement\nsurveys, it makes to try something different. And prioritizing your employee\nengagement efforts just you would any other operational initiative is a great\nplace to start.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/LeadershipIQ) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/leadership-iq/).

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nMikaela Kiner\n\nFounder & CEO of [Reverb](https://reverbpeople.com/). Author of Female\nFirebrands: Powerful Advice for Women at Work (and Their Male Advocates),\ncoming in 2019.\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nI recently attended a Lake Washington Human Resources Association (LWHRA)\nevent focused on employee engagement. Though this is not a new topic, today's\nstate of constant innovation means there's lots to learn about how it's\nevolving. Before engagement, companies measured employee commitment, but soon\nrealized it was a faulty metric. What if your worst-performing employee was\nhighly committed to the company? That's hardly good news.\n\nEngagement became the focus, as it was seen as a more meaningful metric. The\ndefinition of engagement is evolving as belonging, connection and inclusion\nbecome increasingly important to employee retention, driven largely by\nmillennials. Millennials are the [largest\ngeneration](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/11/millennials-\nlargest-generation-us-labor-force/) represented in the U.S. workforce, and we\nknow that this group tends to be motivated by mission and purpose, in addition\nto a paycheck. They value opportunities to grow, give back and build on their\nstrengths.\n\n**Pitfalls Of The Engagement Survey**\n\nNot that long ago, many companies measured engagement through an annual\nemployee engagement survey. These surveys included questions like: Does your\nmanager talk to you about your career? How likely are you to leave the company\nin the next couple years? Do you have a best friend at work?\n\nNot all companies made good use of what they learned, but those that did would\ntransparently communicate results, sponsor employee action committees and\nfollow up at least quarterly by measuring commitments and sharing progress.\nThe goal was to improve a targeted set of low scores, and sometimes it worked.\nPlenty of companies are still doing things like this today.\n\nBut all too often, this process breaks down. Each phase of the survey process\nis prone to risk \u2014 the risk of not communicating, the risk of being defensive\nrather than curious and the risk of inertia. Even leaders with the best\nintentions find that it would have been better to do nothing than ask\nemployees for their feedback and fail to follow through with meaningful\nresponses. Executive teams can get mired in the details looking at various\ndata cuts, trying to interpret what responses mean rather than talking to\nemployees and teams. They argue over which results and comments are most\nimportant, causing long delays between employees taking the survey and\nlearning the outcomes of it. Worst case, employee feedback goes into a vacuum\nonly to find leaders scrambling months later to do something, _anything,_ just\nin time for the next annual survey.\n\n**Complementing Engagement With Employe Affinity**\n\nEven engagement \u2014 and how we as leaders evaluate it \u2014 has its shortcomings.\n\nAt the LWHRA event, David Rowlee, managing director and engagement survey\npractice leader at Gallagher, presented research that explored the connection\nbetween engagement and passion by asking people if they were enthusiastic\nabout their employer and took pride in their company. Researchers asked if\npeople loved working for their organization, and if they could imagine working\nanywhere else.\n\nI found the research's discoveries presented at the conference stunning. While\nengagement was a strong predictor of employee and customer satisfaction,\nengagement with job passion is significantly better \u2014 according to Rowlee,\nmeasuring job passion, or affinity, rather than simply engagement, can double\na manager's ability to predict how an employee will perform.\n\nWhat Gallagher billed as a measurement of affinity is, in my view, really a\nmeasurement of love in a way that's acceptable in a corporate setting. Though\nwe're not used to talking about it in those terms, aren't our attempts to woo\nemployees really a way of building loyalty, pride and, yes, love? Think about\nall of the benefits and perks that companies use to win over employees \u2014 from\nconcierge services to candy walls and unlimited time off. We hope our\nemployees will feel so connected to us, our offices, our teams, our mission,\nthat they'll never want to leave.\n\nArguably, we want our employees to have a sense of purpose and get behind our\nmission. We've learned over time that perks are not synonymous with culture.\nHaving a ping-pong table is fun, but does not ultimately help someone decide\nto stay or go. Many companies are steadily increasing mission and purpose,\ntoo, by sponsoring teams to volunteer together in their communities, matching\ncharitable gifts and creating models that donate products and services to\nthose in need, such as Tom's and Warby Parker. These are practices any\norganization can do that show and foster feelings of affinity.\n\nYou don't have to pick just one measure, and of course a survey is just one\ndata point. That said, if you've been focused on engagement, you'd do well to\nadd mission, purpose and affinity to your list of priorities. Or you can be\nbrave and call it love.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Mikaela Kiner](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/files/2019/01/Mikaela-\nKiner_avatar_1547665028-400x400.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/mikaelakiner1/\n\"Photo of Mikaela Kiner\")\n\n[Mikaela\nKiner](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/people/mikaelakiner1/)\n\nFounder & CEO of [Reverb](https://reverbpeople.com/).

For too long, they have been viewed as the responsibility of\nthe HR department and not an integral part of business strategy. However, it\nis increasingly clear that unhealthy and unengaged employees are a drag on\nproductivity, innovation, and the bottom line.\n\nGallup\u2019s recent [announcement](https://news.gallup.com/poll/241649/employee-\nengagement-rise.aspx) that employee engagement in the U.S. had ticked up to\n34% was seen as a sign of progress\u2014but should we really settle for a situation\nwhere two-thirds of our workforce is still not fully engaged?\n\nMy executive consulting practice was founded on the principle that engagement\nand wellness are inseparable. Healthy employees are happier and show higher\nrates of job satisfaction. Engaged employees show up to work with a bounce in\ntheir step and are less vulnerable to stress, a significant driver of poor\nhealth.\n\nHealthy and engaged employees, in concert with a strong workplace culture, are\nthe secret sauce for business success. The following statistics underscore the\nneed to make engagement and wellness strategic priorities for your\norganization.\n\nToday In: [ForbesWomen](https://www.forbes.com/forbeswomen)\n\n  * [\n\n### How 3 Major LGBTQ Centers Are Virtually Keeping Their Communities Alive\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollysprayregen/2020/04/07/how-3-major-lgbtq-\ncenters-are-virtually-keeping-their-communities-alive/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Three Reminders For Nonprofit Leaders During COVID-19\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alyssawright/2020/04/07/three-things-nonprofit-\nleaders-need-to-remember-during-covid-19/)\n\n  * [\n\n### Maintaining A Focus On Healthcare\u2019s Smallest Patients\n\n](https://www.forbes.com/sites/traceywelsonrossman/2020/04/07/maintaining-a-\nfocus-on-healthcares-smallest-patients/)\n\n **1\\. Highly engaged teams show 21% greater profitability**\n\nThis [finding](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236366/right-culture-not-\nemployee-satisfaction.aspx) by Gallup punctuates the fact that employee\nengagement consists of concrete behavior, not an abstract feeling.\nOrganizations that view engagement as a feeling conduct employee surveys and\noffer perks to improve the results. The report finds that the most successful\norganizations make employee engagement central to their business strategy.\nThey give employees clear expectations and provide them with the tools and\nsupport to do their best work. Why are engaged teams more profitable? Those\nteams who score in the top 20% in engagement realize a 41% reduction in\nabsenteeism, and 59% less turnover. Engaged employees show up every day with\npassion, purpose, presence, and energy.\n\n**2\\. 89% of HR leaders agree that ongoing peer feedback and check-ins are key\nfor successful outcomes**\n\nA recent [report](https://www.globoforce.com/press-releases/globoforce-shrm-\nhuman/) on the importance of employee recognition finds clear and regular\nfeedback to be critical. The report also stresses the importance of what it\ncalls values-based recognition. Feedback and recognition should always tie\nback to a company\u2019s core values and mission. Employees want to be reminded\nthat their work has purpose and meaning. This is another reminder that\nemployee engagement should not be relegated to the HR department, but instead,\nbe featured as a central part of overall business strategy.\n\n**3\\. Employees who feel their voice is heard are 4.6 times more likely to\nfeel empowered to perform their best work**\n\nRecognition and feedback are important but not enough. Today\u2019s\ncollaboratively-minded employee expects communication to be a two-way street.\nAs this Salesforce report also\n[finds](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2018/02/why-equality-and-diversity-\nneed-to-be-priorities), ensuring that employees\u2019 voices are heard needs to be\npart of a larger push for equality and inclusiveness in the workplace.\nCompanies with greater gender and ethnic diversity consistently outperform the\ncompetition. They more accurately reflect the diversity of society and reach\nmore potential customers, and they incorporate a broader range of perspectives\ninto their decision-making and strategy. Inviting more people to the table,\nand ensuring their voices are heard, is a win-win for everyone.\n\n**4\\. 96% of employees believe showing empathy is an important way to advance\nemployee retention**\n\nEmpathy is an essential part of emotional intelligence, the ability to\nidentify and manage one\u2019s own emotions and be mindful of the emotions of\nothers. Engagement and empathy are inextricably linked, as employees are\nunlikely to feel truly respected and empowered in an organization that does\nnot show empathy. A recent report on workplace empathy\n[reveals](https://www.forbes.com/sites/karenhigginbottom/2018/05/31/why-\nempathy-matters-in-the-workplace/#5d1cfea91130) mixed results in this area.\nEmployees are nearly unanimous in agreeing on the importance of empathy\u2014yet\n92% feel empathy remains undervalued. Moreover, while 92% of CEOs feel their\norganization is empathetic, only 50% of their employees say their CEO is\nempathetic. Empathy must start at the top which is one reason why teaching\nemotional intelligence figures so prominently in my work as an executive\ncoach. Empathy may be a soft skill, but it pays off in improved business\noutcomes.\n\n**5\\. Disengaged employees cost U.S. companies up to $550 billion a year**\n\nAn exhaustive [report](https://www.hrdive.com/news/study-disengaged-employees-\ncan-cost-companies-up-to-550b-a-year/437606/) by The Engagement Institute\u2014a\njoint study by The Conference Board, Sirota-Mercer, Deloitte, ROI, The Culture\nWorks and Consulting LLP\u2014underscores how important engagement is to the bottom\nline. Interestingly, the majority of respondents recognize why they are not\nfully engaged. They list compelling missions, highly trusted relationships,\nand well-designed jobs as things they are looking for leadership to provide.\nThis is another reason why communication is crucial to a healthy\norganizational culture. Employees will tell you what they need to be engaged\nif you listen to them.\n\n**6\\. 61% of employees are burned out on the job**\n\nCareerBuilder\u2019s [survey](http://press.careerbuilder.com/2017-05-23-Do-\nAmerican-Workers-Need-a-Vacation-New-CareerBuilder-Data-Shows-Majority-Are-\nBurned-Out-at-Work-While-Some-Are-Highly-Stressed-or-Both) on stress in the\nworkplace also finds 31% of respondents report extremely high levels of stress\nat work. The survey documents how those high-stress levels manifested in poor\nphysical health (fatigue, aches and pains, weight gain) and compromised mental\nhealth (depression, anxiety, anger). These findings emphasize the connections\nbetween wellness and engagement, and how stress undermines both. The best\nstrategies to combat the plague of burnout are holistic approaches. Workshops\non stress management and resilience will lead to a workforce that is\nhealthier, more engaged, and more productive.\n\n**7\\. 89% of workers at companies that support well-being initiatives are more\nlikely to recommend their company as a good place to work**\n\nIn my consulting practice, I have seen that the critical factor in determining\nthe success of wellness programs is the involvement and commitment of senior\nleadership\u2014a fact confirmed by a\n[report](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2016/06/workplace-well-\nbeing.aspx) by the American Psychological Association. In organizations where\nemployees do not view leadership as committed to their well-being, only 17%\nwould recommend the company as a good place to work. The report stresses that\nemployee well-being cannot be addressed through a silo program but is instead\na reflection of broader culture and climate within the organization.\n\n**8\\. 70% of employers have improved their physical environments to encourage\nhealthy behaviors**\n\n[Research](https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en/insights/2016/04/2015-2016-staying-\nat-work-united-states-research-findings) by Willis Towers Watson demonstrates\nhow a growing number of employers are defining workplace health as a central\npart of company culture and strategy. Standalone wellness programs attract\nlimited employee engagement and produce limited returns. Companies finally\nunderstand that wellness must permeate every aspect of an organization.\nReshaping the physical environment to encourage healthy behavior includes\nadding healthy foods to breakrooms and restaurant delivery menus, ergonomic\nworkstations, and appropriate lighting.\n\n**9\\. 61% of employees agree that they have made healthier lifestyle choices\nbecause of their company\u2019s wellness program**\n\nThis is just one of many\n[findings](https://www.aflac.com/docs/awr/pdf/2016-articles/art.trends_2017.ic.pdf)\nin an Aflac summary of current benefit trends. A comprehensive and holistic\nwellness program will help employees change their lifestyle and make better\nchoices, resulting in higher productivity and job satisfaction. The same\nreport finds that Millennials, more than any other group, factor in benefits\nlike health and wellness programs in deciding whether to take or remain in a\njob.\n\n**10\\. 87% of employees expect their employer to support them in balancing\nwork and personal commitments**\n\nA recent Glassdoor [survey](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/two-\nthirds-of-american-workers-would-be-better-employees-if-they-got-more-sleep-\naccording-to-glassdoor-survey-300542688.html) reminds us that our conception\nof wellness has to go beyond traditional health measures. Although the idea of\nwork-life balance is frequently\n[misunderstood](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nazbeheshti/2018/11/12/5-reasons-\nto-stop-talking-about-work-life-balance/#3bb1580128d7), employees are looking\nfor help and support in attending to the non-work areas of their life.\nEmployers can do so by being willing to offer flexible work schedules, and by\nencouraging employees to utilize vacation time.\n\nThe embrace of employee wellness and engagement as strategic imperatives is a\nsignificant paradigm shift in the business world, one that will only grow\nstronger in the coming year. Evolved leaders will bring a spirit of innovation\nto their employee engagement and wellness initiatives, and give them the same\nenergy and care as their core products and services.

digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\nHaving an engaged employee does wonders for businesses - needless to say, when\nan employee is positively engaged and motivated for work, they will put in\ntheir best efforts to drive the organisation forward.\n\nThis was affirmed during a panel session at the [10th Annual Global DWEN\nSummit](https://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/women-powering-business)\nyesterday, attended by _Human Resources Online,_ where panellists discussed\nthe need for engaging employees the right way, and how employers and HR\nleaders can do so.\n\nPanellists _(pictured above from L-R)_ :\n\n  * **Moderator:** Meghan E. Butler, Contributing Writer\n  * Mandy Gilbert, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Creative Niche, Inc.\n  * Tiffany See, Head of Human Resources, Asia, BHP\n  * Dorothy Yiu, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer, EngageRocket\n\nSnippets of the discussion below:\n\n### **Measuring employee engagement is becoming more agile**\n\nAccording to **Dorothy Yiu, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer,\nEngageRocket** , employee engagement is defined in two ways - first, intrinsic\nmotivation of employees, and second, the measure of productivity.\n\nFurther, with workplace transformation moving rapidly, organisations are\nswitching up the way they measure employee engagement.\n\nFor instance, Yiu said, an analysis on companies found even in the most\nadvanced companies like Facebook, employers find surveys to be the most\neffective forms of measurement. In fact, organisations are moving towards more\nagile pulse surveys today.\n\nThus, it is important that HR leaders and employers in-charge of measuring\nemployee engagement cascade the resulting data down to the respective line\nmanagers at the soonest, as this would prove more useful than data that is two\nto three months old (as currently used). Yiu stressed: \"It is better to equip\nline managers with day-to-day data that they can work on instead.\"\n\n### Organisations need to focus on building a positive culture\n\nAs **Tiffany See, Head of Human Resources, Asia, BHP** was quick to point out:\n\n> ##### Culture is like the secret sauce - it differentiates the good from the\n> bad in the company.\n\nIn building a strong culture that would engage and retain talent, See\nhighlights three things to note:\n\n  * First, HR and employers should think about the values that are important to them and the company.\n  * Second, she says: \"Define what those values are, what they look like and what they don't look like. Once you've got clarity on them, think about how you want to see them played out.\"\n  * Third, the leadership team should decide how people are going to be role models of those values. See adds: \"When you have reinforcement everyday, you become more aware of what the values you desire are.\"\n\nFurther, **Mandy Gilbert, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Creative Niche,\nInc.** , added that transparency in communication is key, whereby employers\nshould be clear from the start in letting employees know what the organisation\nis all about. How? She says: \"The experience sharing of leaders, and being\n'vulnerable'. It also helps in learning from other people's mistakes.\"\n\n**Moderator Meghan E. Butler, Contributing Writer** , added: \"Be clear on what\nyou want to achieve; if you have a spirit of transparency and it means a lot\nto you, talk about it. Let the team know why you started the business.\n\n\"When onboarding someone, give them a history of your company, what it's\nabout, have a schedule for their first two weeks here. Incorporate your\ncompany's values in onboarding so there's nothing else for them to learn\n(about the company) down the road.\"\n\nIn addition, Meghan shared that creating a sense of belonging is crucial to\nhaving a conducive team and overall workplace culture.\n\n### The most disruptive trend: A multigenerational workforce\n\nCiting a survey conducted on HR leaders, which asked them what they expected\nto see as the most disruptive trend in the workforce, Yiu noted that\n\"surprisingly\", the most common reply was a multigenerational workforce.\n\nIt was also found that while\n[Millennials](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/how-millennials-and-gen-z-\nacross-southeast-asia-differ-in-their-ambitions-and-concerns/) wanted\nrecognition and autonomy, the older generation wanted stability.\n\nTo this, See stressed the importance of managers making a point to \"understand\ngenerational differences\" by having conversations with them to find out what\nis important, what is needed, and how to shape them.\n\n_Photo / Journalist 's own_\n\n[HR Webinar\nSeries](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\nis a comprehensive portal of online learning solutions catered for you.  \n4 main themes - Thought Leadership, Personal Growth, Case Studies and COVID-19\nManagement.

But the research\nshows that only [22% of\ncompanies](https://www.leadershipiq.com/blogs/leadershipiq/only-22-of-\ncompanies-are-getting-good-results-from-their-employee-engagement-survey) are\ngetting good results from their employee engagement surveys. What constitutes\na good result? Either survey scores were low but they\u2019ve improved\ndramatically, or they were high and they've stayed high. Anything else, like\nscores haven\u2019t changed significantly or scores have declined, would constitute\na poor result.\n\nWhy are so few employee engagement surveys generating good results? Because\nmost companies have the mistaken belief that the purpose of an employee\nengagement survey is to measure employee engagement. It\u2019s not; the purpose of\nconducting a survey is to actually improve employee engagement.\n\nToo many companies treat their survey like they\u2019re \u2018just curious\u2019 and want to\n\u2018check-in\u2019 with the engagement of their employees. But engagement surveys are\ntoo time-consuming on the part of the employees answering the questions for\nthis to be an exercise conducted \u2018out of curiosity.\u2019\n\nMore than 3,000 HR executives have taken the online quiz [\u201cHow Good Is Your\nEmployee Engagement\nSurvey?\u201d](https://www.leadershipiq.com/blogs/leadershipiq/91657409-quiz-how-\ngood-is-your-employee-engagement-survey) One of the questions asks \u201cHow\nwilling is your organization to take action to improve employee engagement\nbased on your survey results?\u201d and test takers are given four choices:\n\n  * We're not willing to act on our survey data\n  * We will take action on easy issues, but we avoid tackling tougher issues\n\n  * We say we're willing to take action, but then we really don't do anything\n  * We are 100% willing to take action on every single question on our survey\n\nClearly, only that last option represents a good choice, and as you can see in\nthe chart below, only 42% of HR executives made that selection.\n\nData from the quiz \u201cHow Good Is Your Employee Engagement Survey?\u201d\n\nLeadership IQ\n\nNow, it\u2019s tempting to look at that 42% and think \u2018well, that doesn\u2019t seem too\nbad,\u2019 but remember this is telling us that 58% of companies (a majority) are\nnot taking meaningful action on the data from their employee engagement\nsurveys.\n\n**Conducting A Survey Implies A Promise That You Are Going To Take Action**\n\nWhen we conduct an employee engagement survey, we\u2019re implying a promise to\nemployees that we\u2019re going to actually do something with the answers. Imagine\nthat I walk downstairs in the morning and ask my wife \u201cdo this shirt and tie\nmatch?\u201d She replies \u201cabsolutely not,\u201d to which I respond \u201cI don\u2019t care what\nyou think, I\u2019m going to wear it anyways.\u201d Given my dismissiveness, she is\ncompletely justified in angrily sniping \u201cthen why did you ask me?\u201d\n\nSimilarly, if we ask employees to expend time and energy to answer our\nquestions about their levels of engagement, and we dismiss those responses, we\ncan expect to hear some very justified employee grumbling that sounds like,\n\u201cGee, the boss asked how we felt about these issues, and we all said lousy,\nand then they didn\u2019t even do anything about it.\u201d\n\nYou can see in the chart that only 5% of companies are blatantly unwilling to\nact on their survey data. And as terrible as that sounds, it\u2019s actually a bit\nbetter than the companies who say they will take action on easy issues but\navoid tackling tougher issues, and those who say they\u2019re willing to take\naction but then don't do anything.\n\n**Insincerely Pretending To Care Is A Big Problem**\n\nThere are bosses and companies who evidence a strong disregard for the\nthoughts and suggestions of their subordinates. While that\u2019s a bad thing,\nthose bosses usually don\u2019t pretend to care. Their personality is dismissive,\nand often standoffish, and they just don\u2019t pretend otherwise. The one positive\naspect of this unpleasantness is that most employees didn\u2019t come work for this\nboss under false pretenses. Yes, the boss is kind of a jerk, but employees\ntypically know that going in.\n\nBy contrast, there are those bosses and companies who pretend to care (e.g. by\nconducting an employee engagement survey) but then take no action. And it\u2019s in\nthose workplaces where we\u2019re more likely to find employees who feel betrayed\nby their boss or company\u2019s dismissal of their feedback. It feels bad when your\nboss doesn\u2019t want your suggestions for improvement. But it feels worse when\nyour boss pretends to want your suggestions (giving you hope) and then\nsecretly ignores or dismisses your ideas.\n\nWe know from the research on [The Risks Of Ignoring Employee\nFeedback](https://www.leadershipiq.com/blogs/leadershipiq/study-the-risks-of-\nignoring-employee-feedback) that only 6% of people say that at their\norganization, good suggestions or valid complaints from employees Always lead\nto important changes. By contrast, 25% say that good suggestions or valid\ncomplaints from employees Never lead to important changes.\n\nMost importantly, if someone says good suggestions or valid complaints from\nemployees Always lead to important changes at their organization, they\u2019re\nabout 18 times more likely to recommend it as a great employer.\n\nSo, to sum up, an employee engagement survey isn\u2019t an exercise conducted \u2018out\nof curiosity.\u2019 An employee engagement survey implies a promise that you\u2019re\ngoing to take action on whatever suggestions emerge. And because most\ncompanies don\u2019t do that, if your company does, not only will you have more\nengaged people, but you will be a significantly more attractive place to work\nwhen it comes to recruiting.\n\nFollow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/LeadershipIQ) or\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/leadership-iq/).

One of the main\nreasons is companies' traditional engagement-measuring tools\u2014employee surveys\nand feedback channels reviewed manually\u2014are inadequate for getting a full\npicture of how employees really feel.\n\nCue sentiment analysis technology powered by natural language processing and\nmachine learning. It interprets huge amounts of feedback to uncover\norganizational strengths and weaknesses and detect positive and negative\nfeelings toward a new policy, a change in benefits, management practices or\nworkplace culture.\n\nHR can then make decisions and changes, based on the feedback, to address\nemployees' concerns, which in turn encourages more open communication and\nhigher engagement.\n\n\"We know how to analyze traditional human capital data, but we've been missing\nthe other side, which is what I would call qualitative insights,\" said Armen\nBerjikly, senior director of growth strategy at Weston, Fla.-based Ultimate\nSoftware. He was the founder and CEO of Kanjoya, a leading software-as-a-\nservice company that developed natural language processing capabilities to\nmeasure and improve employee experience. Kanjoya was acquired by Ultimate\nSoftware in 2016 and rebranded as UltiPro Perception.\n\n\"There's far more going on behind what can be learned from traditional\nquantitative metrics, and it's usually going on in the realm of 'what are\npeople feeling?' and 'why are they feeling that way?' \" Berjikly noted. \"The\ngoal of sentiment analysis technology is to have a machine try to understand\nwhat someone feels and why they feel that way.\"\n\n _[SHRM members-only toolkit : _[_Managing Employee\nSurveys_](/resourcesandtools/tools-and-\nsamples/toolkits/pages/managingemployeesurveys.aspx) _]_\n\nSmarter Surveying\n\nLevel Access, a Vienna, Va.-based company helping organizations ensure that\ntechnology is accessible to people with disabilities, uses UltiPro Perception\nto learn about its 200 employees quickly, without the human bias that comes\nfrom manual review.\n\nBefore the company implemented the tool, employee surveys were inconsistent,\nmaking it difficult for Chief People Officer Colleen Wood to gauge sentiment\ntrends with any surety.\n\nThe company had conducted exit surveys for years but hadn't used standard\nquestions, she said. And general employee surveys were given at random times,\nwith different questions, so there was no way to truly compare how things were\nchanging.\n\nSince Level Access was already using Ultimate's HR information system,\nadopting UltiPro Perception was a natural fit. Easily integrating the survey\ntool with the company's employee demographics and organizational information\nmakes slicing and dicing the data that much easier, Wood said.\n\nShe fed 20 years of exit survey data into the tool, allowing her to study\nlong-term trends. She also can now capture feedback from employees with short,\nroutinely timed pulse surveys asking about relevant topics. \"If it's goal-\nsetting time, we might ask about goals,\" Wood said, \"or we will ask employees\nto rate a recent all-hands meeting.\"\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe discipline of sentiment analysis based on language has been around for a\nlong time, said Holger Mueller, vice president and principal analyst at\nConstellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm based in\nCupertino, Calif. But the application of digital data analytics technology to\nsentiment is more recent.\n\nLisa Abbott, vice president of marketing at Wootric, a feedback management\nsoftware company in San Francisco, said engagement surveys that solicit open-\nended feedback return voluminous amounts of sentiment. \"It quickly becomes\nimpossible to read, let alone act on, every piece of open-ended feedback,\" she\nsaid.\n\nIn addition, there's always the potential to introduce bias into an evaluation\nwith manual review.\n\nBefore implementing sentiment analysis technology, conclusions from a survey\nreview at Level Access essentially came down to Wood's \"gut feeling about what\nI was reading,\" she said.\n\nA sentiment analytics platform uses machine learning to recognize emotion in\nthe text, Abbott said. \"As themes are recognized, each employee comment from\nthe various surveys can be tagged with the relevant theme and sentiment\u2014for\nexample, positive, negative or neutral. The algorithms do the grunt work,\nreading the qualitative feedback and organizing comments into different\nbuckets with respective tags.\"\n\nWhile the technology helps HR managers understand general worker sentiment,\nBerjikly said Ultimate's tool also allows HR to view employees' emotions with\nmore granularity.\n\n\"Previously, both confusion and concern would have fallen under the negative\numbrella, but that doesn't help me improve employee engagement or job\nsatisfaction,\" he said. \"Even after drilling down and seeing that employees\nare sad or excited about something is not enough. You want to find out why\nthey feel that way in order to solve business problems. Sentiment analytics\ncan tie employees' confusion to their benefits, or their concern to pay\nequity.\"\n\nBut sentiment analysis will only be successful if enough employees submit\nenough text to be studied, Mueller said. \"Technology has made the inputs\neasier, but employees don't really want to write long sections in response to\nsurveys or performance reviews. People have survey fatigue. Sometimes the\nemployer forces it and gets garbage in return, which brings into question the\ndata and the validity of the analysis.\"\n\nBest Practices\n\nHere are some practical takeaways for HR professionals who are using sentiment\nanalysis technology:\n\n**Survey genuine issues.** \"Employees very quickly find out if only \u2026 routine\ntopics are being surveyed,\" Mueller said. \"It's important that survey\ndesigners are in contact with operational teams that know what the true\nchallenges, opportunities and hot topics are among employees.\"\n\n **Field short surveys less often.** Surveys should not take more than five to\nseven minutes to complete, Mueller said, adding that employees will be quickly\nturned off by a tool that requires too much of their time. \"Finding the right\nbalance between frequency and necessity is crucial for the success of any\nsurvey tool.\"\n\n **Show the connection.** Wood said employees at Level Access are thrilled to\nhave a way to share feedback and receive the results of that feedback. \"We\nclose the feedback loop by outlining 'here's what we asked, here's what you\nsaid, and here's what we are going to do about it.' If you share the results\nand what you will do to respond to employees' concerns, you are able to drive\ntrust and encourage future survey responses.\"\n\n **Commit to privacy.** Employee privacy is critical. \"Anything less is a dead\nend for a survey tool,\" Mueller said. \"Ensuring privacy and anonymity of the\nsurvey tool is crucial for the success of its implementation because the right\nbalance is the only way for employees to keep taking surveys and maintaining\ntrust.\"  \n\n  \n\n[Leadership and Navigation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Leadership and\nNavigation) [Change Management](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Change\nManagement) [Technology Metrics and\nAnalytics](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Technology Metrics and Analytics)\n[Consultation](/search/pages/default.aspx?topic=Consultation)\n\nLIKE SAVE **__PRINT** **__EMAIL**\n____[__](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Employee+Sentiment+Analysis+Shows+HR+All+the+Feels&amp;url=https://www.shrm.org/ResourcesAndTools/hr-\ntopics/technology/Pages/Employee-Sentiment-Analysis-Shows-HR-All-the-\nFeels.aspx)\n\n_ _ __Reuse Permissions\n\nMembers may download one copy of our sample forms and templates for your\npersonal use within your organization.

needs a hard-headed make-over, but some significant barriers\nare holding back the revolution, management consultants We Are Unity and\nMacquarie University say.\n\nTheir survey of about 250 companies indicates the need for a radical rethink\nof HR, most notably putting hard financials around the fluffy feelings and\nmaking boards understand HR better.\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nSam Mostyn is one of the rare directors with core experience in human\nrelations.\n\nThe survey highlighted a clear over-reliance on engagement surveys when\ncompanies are making commercial culture decisions (49 per cent of\nrespondents), given only one in three HR leaders can demonstrate a link\nbetween engagement and business performance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing for HR to swallow, but for the last two decades everyone\nhas believed if you [chased engagement scores](https://www.afr.com/policy/is-\nit-a-cheap-shot-to-criticise-employee-engagement-20180827-h14juf), profits and\nresults would follow,\u201d says We Are Unity CEO Ben Bars. \u201cBut companies are not\nseeing that.\u201d\n\nNatalie Jones, transformation director at Pernod Ricard Winemakers and a\nformer long-time HR boss at Mars, acknowledges she was part of the pursuit for\nengagement scores.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was probably one of the only really tangible measures we had to offer as\nHR,\u201d she says.\n\nJones faced a unique problem at Mars, where super high engagement scores\nweren\u2019t necessarily translating to commercial outcomes.\n\nThe food manufacturer is regularly voted one of the country's best places to\nwork. Long-time workers are nicknamed \u201cMarsians\u201d and colleagues are treated as\nfamily and friends.\n\nBut a deep analytical dive showed managers were avoiding tough conversations\nand often working most closely with friends, which was affecting the pace and\nfocus of the organisation\u2019s performance.\n\nThe fix included multiple off-site sessions where managers were asked to stand\nwith people they trusted most, then had to move to stand and engage with those\nthey needed to work most closely with for the sake of the business.\n\n\u201cWe gained the clarity needed to understand how some of our perceived\nstrengths were equally holding back the organisation\u2019s growth,\u201d Jones says.\n\u201cWe were being relationship and feeling driven, but we needed to make more\ndecisions based on facts. It made me think more broadly about the impact of\nculture.\n\n![](/assets/b4682377.gif)\n\nMars is regularly voted one of Australia's the best companies to work for.\nJeremy Bannister\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need HR to start talking the language of business and lean into that\nchallenge of driving business performance.\u201d\n\nThe report\u2019s authors also point to a dearth of directors with relevant HR\nexperience, with people leaders reporting that only half of all boards are\ncommitted to the cultural change required to drive better business results.\n\nAmong the 1994 board seats on top 300 ASX companies, just 15 directors \u2013 or\n0.8 per cent \u2013 have core HR skills (although that\u2019s up from 0.4 per cent in\n2016, according to the board diversity index from executive search firm\nWatermark).\n\n> Having a HR person on your board shows how serious you are about getting\n> culture right.\n>\n> \u2014 Ben Bars, We Are Unity CEO\n\nANZ\u2019s Ilana Atlas and NAB\u2019s Ann Sherry are among the few directors with HR\nexperience on the big bank boards. Sam Mostyn (who sits on numerous boards\nincluding Mirvac, Transurban and Citibank), CSR CEO Julie Coates, Medibank\ndirector Peter Hodgett and Baby Bunting chairman Ian Cornell are also notable\nexceptions.\n\n\u201cThere are not a lot of HR leaders on boards,\u201d Bars says. \u201cWhen you present\nyour people and culture strategy, directors can review it through the lens of\ntheir experience from 20 years ago, but the world has changed.\n\n\u201cHaving a HR person on your board shows how serious you are about getting\nculture right.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the survey, only 52 per cent of HR leaders reported that their function had\na strong professional brand within their organisation, and only 32 per cent\nsaid they could directly relate the commercial impact of HR on business\noutcomes. Both findings underline the need for an overhaul.\n\nBars says the best HR leaders use employee engagement in combination with\nsophisticated analytics to ensure any investment will generate a tangible\ncommercial outcome.\n\n\u201cIf a company strategy says we need to grow by 6 per cent in the next 12\nmonths, how can HR prove that its initiatives are linked to that 6 per cent\ngrowth?\u201d he says.\n\n## Better use of metrics\n\nNick Tucker, culture and performance lead at We Are Unity and one of the\nreport\u2019s authors, agrees HR needs to link more closely to outcomes such as\nsharemarket performance, pace of innovation, customer experience and\nsustainability, rather than simply quoting percentage scores on employee\nengagement.\n\n\u201cThe metrics you need to track as an HR team are the metrics your business\ntracks and cares about,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is very difficult in a lot of situations\nfor HR to quantify their contribution to the commercial impact of a business.\u201d\n\nDespite boards\u2019 [focus on culture](https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-\nservices/we-need-to-talk-about-our-corporate-culture-problem-20190627-p521q1),\nthe survey also found only half of all boards are committed to the culture\nchange required to drive business results. More than 70 per cent of HR leaders\ncalled out this tension as a concern. Even where boards are committed to\nchange, directors may be pitted against executives, if executives only receive\nbonuses for growth and financial metrics.\n\nThe consultants say the future also requires breaking down cultural silos so\nthat HR and risk departments can work alongside each other, to ensure\ncompanies are driving the right behaviours.\n\nSave\n\nLog in or\n[Subscribe](https://subscribe.afr.com/?promote_channel=HI_AFR_GNL_HL&utm_source=afr.com&utm_medium=HouseInventory&utm_campaign=General&utm_content=HDR)\nto save article\n\nShare\n\n[License\narticle](http://rightsportal.copyright.com.au/pages/republicationpage.aspx?author=Patrick%20Durkin&publication=AFR&publicationdate=2020-03-03T23%3A50%3A00Z&publisher=fxj&title=Why%20HR%20needs%20a%20radical%20rethink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.afr.com%2Fwork-\nand-careers%2Fworkplace%2Fwhy-hr-needs-a-radical-rethink-20200207-p53yto)\n\n### Read More\n\n  * [BOSS](/boss)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n  * [Workplace](/topic/workplace-hzd)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n  * [Leadership lessons](/topic/leadership-lessons-1mwr)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n  * [Social responsibility](/topic/corporate-social-responsibility-1mt9)\n\nUnable to follow, try again\n\n **[Patrick Durkin](/by/patrick-durkin-j7gb7)** is Melbourne bureau chief and\nBOSS deputy editor.

The moment\norganizations realized the impact that employee engagement (EE) has on the\nperformance of every employee, the importance assigned to finding fresh\nemployee engagement ideas surged. But, are all our EE ideas and strategies\ngenuinely useful? Here we explore ten impactful solutions to the employee\nengagement puzzle._**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834cadce393.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\nWhen was the last time you took a step back and did a quick check on your\nemployee engagement strategies, ideas, initiatives, and activities? If EE\nplans are set in motion with the thought that they would run themselves, the\nusual result is disengagement. There is a need to evaluate and upgrade\nemployee engagement strategies as we head into 2020 to ensure that they are in\nsync with the changing times and the changing demands of the dynamic talent\necosystem.\n\n## **Where Are We Going Wrong With Employee Engagement?**\n\nA 2018 study by Gallup reported that the U.S. workforce had reached its\nhighest engagement level at 34% and that the percentage of actively disengaged\nemployees had also been lower than ever at 13%.1 While these numbers sound\nhopeful, they hold within them a question \u2013 what is it that is keeping the\nremaining 53% of the workforce from being engaged at work? Before we jump to\nthe impactful ways to engage employees in 2020, let\u2019s take a look at what has\nbeen plaguing our solutions at present.\n\n### **1\\. Employees experience persistent stress at work**\n\n  \nWork does not need to be stressful, yet that has become the norm. The question\nyou need to ask is whether employees are being expected to fulfill\nunreasonable demands.\n\nFor example, do leaders expect employees to behave like them instead of the\nemployees\u2019 true self? Are the processes at work creating infinite loops of\ncommunication (and communication failure) that add to stress levels? Are\nemployees stressed because they cannot see a development plan and feel caught\nup in monotonous tasks?\n\n### **2\\. Employees feel undervalued**\n\n  \nWith organizations like Deloitte focusing on the idea of hiring for attitude\nand training for skill, an interesting point comes to the forefront \u2013 the need\nto make individuals feel valued throughout the employee lifecycle and to focus\non developing capabilities that they inherently possess.\n\nWhen employees feel their potential is not being nurtured to the fullest,\ntheir involvement in and commitment to work declines. It is also necessary to\nmake employees realize their power and influence with regard to the collective\ngrowth of the organization. Being allowed to make decisions and mistakes is\nnot only a great way to help them learn but also to help them feel valued and\nto grow into their elevated roles.\n\n### **3\\. Employees don\u2019t feel enabled at work**\n\n  \nWhile we are consciously moving towards creating cultures that enable, enrich,\nand empower, the progress has been slow and fitful. Employees need to feel\nenabled all the time and not only during certain phases.\n\nLeaders who can make employees feel that they have their backs are also great\nas enablers. Without an environment that makes employees feel wanted, valued,\nand enabled, no matter the investment in technology and processes, employee\nengagement will not be a tangible outcome.\n\n## **10 Impactful Ways You Can Engage Employees**\n\nWhile there is a multitude of **[fresh employee engagement\nideas](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-\nemployee-engagement-ideas/) **that come and go in the world of work, are there\nbasic, evergreen strategy-pillars that could help us understand how to improve\nemployee engagement?\n\nThe answer is yes. As EE specialists and employee engagement activity vendors\nhave realized as well, the core strategy needs to be in place, and then the\nparaphernalia around it may be tailored to suit the unique needs of the\norganization and our changing times. In other words, despite being evergreen,\nthese solutions would still need tweaks to increase their relevance in the\ncoming years.\n\nAnswer these questions to assess your readiness for employee engagement\ninitiatives in 2020 and ahead.\n\n### **1\\. Do you encourage free conversation and employee feedback?**\n\n  \nAs younger generations of workers enter the workforce, they demand free\nconversation and an environment where they can express themselves comfortably,\nwithout fear. Conversation and open communication drive engagement. And\nenabling employees to communicate feedback, criticism, and ideas is a great\nway to inject and circulate fresh perspectives into the organization while\nalso giving them a platform to share their thoughts.\n\nWhether feedback is solicited formally through monthly roundtables, informally\nthrough frequent team catch-ups, or on a daily ad-hoc basis over internal\ncommunication portals like Slack and other intranet solutions, the idea\nremains to create a culture of sharing.\n\n### **2\\. Is your workplace diverse, inclusive, and equal?**\n\n  \n2019 saw the rise of several issues on diversity and inclusion, and 2020 is\nwhen these issues are going to be addressed. The current and future\ngenerations of workers will be more diverse than ever, which means your\norganization must have a robust inclusion policy that focuses on the equality\nof all employees across the organization. The wave of employee activism rose\nin 2019, and to keep employees engaged, organizations will have to have an\nactive employee activism strategy in place that addresses employee concerns.\n\nIn these cases, organizations will have to focus on using **[employee\nengagement surveys](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-an-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-\nexamples/)** and other platforms to measure the engagement of target groups:\nwomen, members of minority groups, members of LGBTQIA communities, and so on,\nto ensure that they have the necessary resources to stay engaged on the job.\n\n### **3\\. Are you invested in employee development?**\n\n  \nAn organization\u2019s promise of employee growth must include plans for their\ncareer development to ensure long-term engagement. It is essential to involve\nthe employee in their development map so that you automatically have more buy-\nin and fix goals based on aspects of work and growth that the employee values.\n\nWhile you engage in competency mapping for the organization on the whole and\nconduct a talent gap analysis, do the same at the individual level to help\nevery employee get on and stay on a path of growth and success.\n\nWith AI making inroads into the sphere of learning and development, the\nprocesses around this aspect of work have seen quality improvements, are more\nrelatable, and they are easier to access. Building a learning organization\nboosts engagement, as employees realize that the organization cares about not\nonly helping them develop their skills for their current role but also helping\nthem and expand their skill set for future roles.\n\n### **4\\. Are you a flexible organization?**\n\n  \nThere\u2019s increasing conversation around four-day workweeks, remote working, and\nflexible models of work. Surprisingly, the amount of work expected of\nemployees doesn't seem to be reducing in spite of decreasing workdays.\n\nIn this environment, organizations can engage employees and enable a work-life\nbalance by offering them the flexibility to perform this work at their\nconvenience. The technology that enables these two aspects of work is\nessential to ensure that you can provide the flexibility employees require.\n\nIt\u2019s time for organizations to adopt some remote work tools to make the\ntransition to flexible working and build remote work policies.\n\n### **5\\. Have you upgraded your rewards and recognition (R &R;) methods?**\n\n  \nHow you go about recognizing and rewarding your employees for a job well done\nneeds to change in keeping with the target group at hand, their needs,\nexpectations, and the external environment that they are a part of.\n\nSocial recognition is necessary today not only because we are all living in an\nera that demands constant social attention but also because being recognized\nin public enhances the value of our achievements.\n\nR&R; processes also need to be engaging \u2013 for example, nominating an achiever\nto be the CEO for a day, rolling out fun newsletters to let the whole\norganization know about employees\u2019 commendable performance, or uploading an\nindividualized video for them on the organization\u2019s social media pages.\n\n### **6\\. Does your organization have a transparent workplace culture?**\n\n  \nAn inclusive culture of transparency enables accountability and engagement.\nThis is primarily because employees feel driven to deliver on their jobs \u2013 not\nbecause they fear being watched but because they know that the transparent\norganization will help them stay on track.\n\nCollaborative tools such as Basecamp and Jira ensure that everyone in the team\nis aware of the status of multiple projects, where they individually stand in\nterms of deadlines and contribution, as well as predicted bottlenecks.\nTransparent systems also improve communication in the workplace, in turn\nimproving the quality of interaction within and between teams.\n\n### **7\\. Are your employees\u2019 goals aligned with your organization\u2019s goals?**\n\n  \nWhile it is true that role satisfaction plays an important part in **[employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/)** , another way to look at it is to check whether\nroles employees fill are actually in keeping with the job description they\napplied for.\n\nThis is where goal alignment comes into play \u2013 whether employees feel that\ntheir skills and capabilities are relevant for the goals that they are\nsupposed to attain, whether their individual goals are aligned with the\noverall corporate goals and whether their goals beyond the role and their\ncareer are being addressed as well. For this, these goals must be communicated\nclearly to them when they start work in the organization.\n\nThis is an essential pillar of employee engagement and happiness at work\nbecause it directly links everyday aspects of the employee's work to the\nlarger picture and the greater vision.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Employee Engagement vs. Employee Experience: Are They\nReally That Different?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/employee-engagement-vs-employee-experience-are-they-different/)\n\n### **8\\. Does your candidate experience resemble future employee\nexperience?**\n\n  \nThere is some amount of debate on the relevance of **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\nto the overall employee engagement and experience. However, we firmly believe\nthat the candidate experience you offer sows the seeds for employee engagement\nbecause it holds within it a promise of the kind of employee experience the\nindividual can expect.\n\nImproving the candidate experience with fair screening processes, quicker\nfeedback, and a meaningful onboarding experience sets the tone for the\nemployee's stint with the organization. This is where your conversation with\nthe individual begins, and employees remember the experience they had as\ncandidates.\n\nCompanies and HR must be careful to establish a consistent experience both\nbefore and after the employee joins the organization.\n\n### **9\\. Do you offer a culture of continuous improvement?**\n\n  \nBuilding excitement around continuous improvement builds on employee\nengagement. Investing time, effort, and resources in workshops, activities,\nand events that empower a culture of continuous improvement translate it from\na distant kaizen-centric concept to a daily actionable. This will help you\ncreate a workforce that is driven to do better every day. This drive serves as\nimmense motivation and makes employees realize that they are part of a\nmacrocosm where they play a unique role.\n\n### **10\\. Does company leadership regularly interact with employees?**\n\n  \nAs we head into the future of work, we see leadership transitioning as much as\nthe workforce is. Leaders are expected to be more agile, more communicative,\nand more connected with their workforce. Attention from leaders can be one of\nthe key factors that help employees feel more valued \u2013 a part of the bigger\npicture.\n\nWhen leaders share how employees\u2019 contributions affect the bottom line,\nemployees are more likely to feel engaged in their jobs and give it their\nbest.\n\nLeadership begins at the managerial level, and the first level of\ncommunication must occur between the line manager and the employee. Higher\nleadership must then connect with employees through various means of internal\ncommunications, such as online or through regular town halls. For example,\nthough it has been reduced to once a month from a weekly meeting, Google\nleadership conducts town halls with its employees regularly to discuss company\nupdates and hear from employees.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Top 10 Employee Engagement Apps for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/top-\nemployee-engagement-apps/)**\n\n## **Get. Set. Engage.**\n\nWith a glimpse into the three ways organizations lose out on employee\nengagement and ten ways to better engagement in 2020, it is your turn to\ntranslate them into practice in a way that makes sense for your organization\nand the different expectations of your employees.\n\nDo make your employees aware that you want to take the onus of helping them\nfeel more engaged, involved, absorbed, and committed at work. That said,\nworkplace engagement is a shared effort. Employees need to feel motivated to\ntake their engagement into their own hands as well \u2013 to feel that they want to\nbe engaged at work, to do better, and to feel better about their role.\n\nGetting engagement right in 2020 requires you to keep a close watch on how the\nworkforce and its preferences are evolving.

Sometimes, when workers do fill them out and HR\ndiscovers a department has a morale problem, it can be just as difficult to\nget those workers to speak up and explain why they're unhappy.\n\nAnd there's a reason for that, employee engagement experts say.\n\nEmployee engagement surveys, and the way they're administered, tend to have\nflaws that either prevent leaders from truly understanding morale at their\ncompanies, or from doing much to lift morale if it's low, said Rajeev\nPeshawaria, author of [_Open Source Leadership : Reinventing Management When\nThere's No More Business As\nUsual_](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.amazon.com_Open-2DSource-2DLeadership-2DReinventing-2DManagement_dp_1260108368_ref-3Dsr-5F1-5F1-3Fie-3DUTF8-26qid-3D1511980981-26sr-3D8-2D1-26keywords-3Dopen-2Bsource-2Bleadership&d=DwMGaQ&c=nQOnw6HHAeKBNxj23OXhOw&r=iiaa6ieLxV-\nk_QNRTeCJxJAAFhiaVjIAu-RGACwx0yY&m=QSnI-2Rj1oMrLkoHvJ5GyuK7wWvinl-\nBny8lhQjRUAs&s=LysoowF2_EHhPeUP4fch15lHE0mTgb9HYfltoZ6ISXs&e=) (McGraw-Hill,\n2017), and CEO of The Iclif Leadership and Governance Centre, a Malaysia-based\nnonprofit that focuses on executive education, research and coaching.\n\nFor one thing, he said, the best-performing employees are often so busy that\nthey don't take time to fill out such surveys. Hence, he said, \"the bulk of\nthe data therefore [comes from] average- or low-performing employees.\"\n\nFor another, he said, some workers don't believe that such surveys will\nprotect their anonymity. So they refuse to fill them out.\n\nNo Such Thing as Anonymity?\n\nAre engagement surveys really anonymous?\n\nMany surveys ask such detailed information about the respondent\u2014what\ndepartment they work in, their general title, their compensation level, how\nmany years they've been with the company\u2014that workers suspect that managers\ncan easily figure out which replies were from whom.\n\n\"There is no such thing as anonymous,\" Peshawaria said. \"If management really\nwants to find out who said what, they easily can. That said, the difference\nbetween ethical and unethical management is whether they choose to find out.\nIt boils down to trust.\"\n\nMost such surveys are \"confidential\" but not \"anonymous,\" said Peter Foley and\nMegan Connolly, a principal and a senior consultant, respectively, with\nPurchase, N.Y.-based Mercer Sirota, an employee engagement consultancy.\n\n\"They are not technically anonymous because the [company] is typically\nreceiving \u2026 data that indicates the employee's business unit, tenure, etc.,\"\nthey said. \"Depending on the number of these demographic questions, this\napproach can generate \u2026 concern and skepticism regarding confidentiality.\"\n\nOne way to combat that skepticism, they said, is for the company or its HR\ndepartment to not only emphasize the confidentiality of the survey, but to\nalso address concerns that demographic information about the respondent won't\nbe used to peg replies to specific employees.\n\nAnother way, they said, is to rely on an independent third party to administer\nthe survey and analyze the results, with the understanding that the company\nmay have aggregate information about respondents' demographics, but not\nindividual information that might allow them to identify respondents.\n\nMarathon Health, a Winooski, Vt.-based company that helps employers provide\nworkers with personalized health care plans, asks employees to share their\nworkplace experiences several times throughout the year, not just on an annual\nsurvey, said Matt Riley, SHRM-SCP, Marathon Health's vice president of people\noperations.  \n  \n\"If we betray that confidence, we know we won\u2019t get the truth going forward,\"\nhe said. \"We do everything we can to build and keep that trust.\" He noted that\nsome employee engagement surveys aggregate data in a manner so that no\ndemographic data is reveealed unless there are at least five or six responses.  \n\nAddressing Employee Discontent\n\nIf a survey reveals widespread discontent in a department, whether a leader\nwill be able to address employee concerns will depend on how candid workers\nfeel they can be with that leader.\n\n\"They need to trust that leader, and trust that there won't be retaliation for\nspeaking the truth,\" Peshawaria said.\n\n\"To earn trust, [a leader] should have demonstrated all along that he cared\nabout his employees, and should not have waited until the survey to find out\nthat there was a morale problem,\" he said. \"Surveys are a very poor substitute\nfor daily face-to-face communication. The idea is to create enough trust such\nthat people can speak up without having to hide behind surveys. Keep talking\nto your people all year long, stay in touch with their issues and keep\ninspiring them about the mission and purpose of the organization.\"\n\n _[SHRM members-only toolkit : _[_Developing and Sustaining Employee\nEngagement_](/resourcesandtools/tools-and-\nsamples/toolkits/pages/sustainingemployeeengagement.aspx) _]_\n\nWhen leaders do learn of morale problems through surveys, \"their reactions can\nrange from denial and defensiveness, to an embracing attitude that looks at\nthe results as a baseline measure upon which improvements can be made,\" Foley\nand Connolly said.\n\n\"It is incumbent upon the organization being surveyed, as well as [any]\noutside consultant, to help foster an environment where the survey is seen as\nan integral and on-going way of doing business, not a means for retribution,\"\nthey said.\n\nFor instance, workers aren't likely to be honest about their concerns if a\nmanager has a habit of yelling at or berating direct reports, is prone to\ndiscount their suggestions, or tends to grow defensive or to cast blame when\nsomething reflects poorly on his department. In addition, they said, a manager\nwho discovers low morale among his workers, then calls a brief, half-hour\nmeeting and asks them to discuss their concerns, tends to send the message\nthat their concerns aren't that important.\n\n\"Employee survey results are not opportunities to take employees to task,\"\nRiley said. \"Approaching the responses with the employees\u2019 best interests in\nmind is a start. The key is to be open and listen\u2014and if there\u2019s a problem,\nstrategize on how to approach fixing it.\"  \n\nIf employees are not comfortable being candid with their manager, a third-\nparty facilitator can be very effective, Foley and Connolly said.  \n\n\"Bringing in an outside facilitator to conduct focus groups and generate\nactions for improvement \u2026 can often be a way of \u2026 generating ideas for re-\nestablishing trusting relationships.\"\n\nFinally, they said, the survey will only be as successful as the effort\nmanagers put into post-survey change. \"For employees to trust that the [time]\nthey take out of their day to respond to a survey is worthwhile, they need to\nsee managers sharing the survey responses with their team in a constructive\nway, asking for ideas on how to improve and making a commitment to these\nchanges.\"\n\n>  _Was this article useful?

the cloud-technology giant with a market cap of $143 billion -\ntakes organizational openness to a new level.\n\nTwice a year Salesforce runs a survey that asks all employees to respond to\nsome standard prompts for gauging how people feel about their jobs. _Do you\nsee yourself working at Salesforce in two years? Are you willing to give extra\nto get the job done? Are you comfortable telling your boss when your workload\nbecomes unmanageable?_\n\nThe next step in the process is less traditional. Salesforce's HR department\ncollects the survey results - and instead of keeping that data to themselves,\nthey publish it to the entire organization. Responses are anonymized, so that\nif Sara in marketing says she plans to quit within the next two years, it's\nnot like all her coworkers find out.\n\nWhat everyone _can_ see is how well an individual manager is performing.\nAssuming a manager has at least five direct reports complete the survey, those\nemployees' aggregate scores, on measures like how engaged or burned out they\nfeel, are made accessible to the whole company.\n\nThe goal isn't to publicly shame low-performing leaders. Instead it's to find\nout which management practices are working and which aren't, and to help\nemployees figure out whether they'd rather join another team (with another\nboss) at Salesforce.\n\nThere's reason to believe that this emphasis on transparency has contributed\nto the company's success. Salesforce consistently ranks as one of the most\ndesirable companies, and its employees say they're [ happy at\nwork](https://www.businessinsider.com/comparably-big-companies-with-the-\nhappiest-employees).\n\nJody Kohner, Salesforce's senior vice president of employee engagement, shared\nwith Business Insider her key takeaway from the surveys. The company's best\nleaders don't just make their numbers, whether that's revenue or new client\nleads. Beyond that, Kohner said, \"We're able to hold managers accountable to\ncreating teams that are enthusiastic about Salesforce and who are having a\ngreat experience.\"\n\n##  The best bosses at Salesforce allow their team to take risks and make\nmistakes\n\nSalesforce has been surveying employees for a while now. But only in the last\nfive years has it started releasing the survey results to the entire company.\n\nSince then, the organization has been better able to pinpoint its most\neffective managers, figure out what they're doing well, and then scale those\nbehaviors companywide. It also helps turn abstract strategies (emphasize the\nimportance of personal well being) into more concrete behaviors (lead by\nexample; don't hesitate to let employees know you're leaving at 5 pm to make\nyour kid's soccer game).\n\nGenerally speaking, Kohner said, Salesforce's most successful managers \"embody\nour core values\" of trust, customer success, innovation, and equality.\n\nThe best bosses at Salesforce are also more likely to cultivate [\npsychological safety](https://www.businessinsider.com/amy-edmondson-on-\npsychological-safety-2015-11) on their teams. That's a scientific term coined\nby Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson to describe an environment\nin which people feel comfortable taking risks, like admitting when they've\nmade a mistake or asking a seemingly naive question. When [ Google looked\ninto](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-explains-top-traits-of-its-best-\nteams-2015-11) the traits of its most successful teams, psychological safety\nturned out to be the most important.\n\nAt Salesforce, Kohner said, \"you have to be able to work in an environment\nwhere people can take risks, where they can have courageous conversations,\nwhere they can really feel like they are connected and they are empowered to\ndo the best work of their lives.\"\n\n##  Salesforce employees can use the survey results to find another manager\nthey'd like to work for instead\n\nAs for those leaders whose teams aren't so engaged, at least according to the\nsurvey, Salesforce might recommend [ management\ntraining](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/manage_the_sfdc_way_great_management/great_management_the_salesforce_way)\nto help the leader improve.\n\nSalesforce offers programs including \"[Fearless\nTeaming](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/fearless-\nteaming-ext)\" (which focuses on psychological safety), as well as programs on\nunconscious bias and inclusive leadership. These resources are all available\non Trailhead, the company's online learning platform designed to train current\nand aspiring Salesforce employees.\n\nThe survey results also allow employees who are considering a new role within\nthe organization find a manager they might like to work for. Since Salesforce\nlaunched an [ internal mobility](https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-\nemployees-change-jobs-internal-mobility-2018-12) program (which creates more\nopportunities to switch teams) in 2018, employees have been staying longer at\nthe company.\n\nWhen Kohner saw the results from her own team, she noticed one manager who'd\nscored highly on almost every measure in the survey. \"I started leaning into\nher best practices more and asking for more guidance from her,\" Kohner said.\nIn particular, Kohner learned that this manager expended \"extra energy and\neffort\" to \"really connect with each person as an individual.\"\n\nKohner added, \"The depths of the relationships that she has built on her team\nhave created an incredible foundation of trust. And when you have that, you\ncan build anything on top of it.\".\n\n  * TAGS\n  * [Employee Engagement](/tag/employee-engagement/)\n  * [HR Insider](/tag/hr-insider/)\n  * [HRI ADP](/tag/hri-adp/)\n  * [Leadership](/tag/leadership/)\n  * [Management](/tag/management/)\n  * [Salesforce](/tag/salesforce/)\n\n[[Shana Lebowitz](https://www.businessinsider.com/author/shana-\nlebowitz/?IR=T), [Joe Williams](https://www.businessinsider.com/author/joe-\nwilliams/?IR=T), [Business Insider\nUS](http://www.businessinsider.com/?IR=T)](https://www.businessinsider.sg/author/businessinsider)\n\n#### Popular Articles\n\n  * [![](https://static.businessinsider.sg/sites/2/wordpress-popular-posts/3369975-featured-100x70.png)](https://www.businessinsider.sg/free-online-coursera-courses \"100 online courses from Coursera are $0 now through May 31 \u2014 here\u2019s a list of all the classes open for free enrollment\") [[100 online courses from Coursera are $0 now through May 31 -- here's a list of all the classes open for free enrollment](https://www.businessinsider.sg/free-online-coursera-courses \"100 online courses from Coursera are $0 now through May 31 \u2014 here\u2019s a list of all the classes open for free enrollment\")](https://www.businessinsider.sg/free-online-coursera-courses)\n\n  * [![](https://static.businessinsider.sg/sites/2/wordpress-popular-posts/3223732-featured-100x70.png)](https://www.businessinsider.sg/how-long-can-coronavirus-live-on-surfaces-how-to-disinfect-2020-3 \"The coronavirus can live on a surgical mask for 7 days, cloth for 2 days, and paper for 3 hours.

It is not just about your metrics or Glassdoor\nrating!\n\nIf your VoE program is struggling to drive value in your business, consider\nthese three ways to improve performance:\n\n## #1: Listen the Right Way\n\nStep one: Stop asking if employees are happy. See if people are emotionally\ninvested. People will mentally check out if they feel they\u2019re not being heard.\nA successful employee experience strategy prioritizes an approach to listening\nthat is sensitive to the culture of the business and responsive to the\nchanging needs of employees and teams. Combine requested surveys at key\nmoments of the employee lifecycle with spontaneous sources like online comment\nboxes and social media.\n\nContinuous feedback is critical to understanding employees\u2019 impact at every\nstage of your business. People working on the front lines understand customer\npain points better than the C-suite. They have a more direct view on how they\ncan improve culture and business performance. But employees won\u2019t share their\nideas for change if they think it\u2019s a waste of time. Don\u2019t lose out on their\ninsights by failing to actually listen!\n\n## #2: Create a Culture of Feedback\n\nA new suite of tools, leadership support, and a rollout plan simply aren\u2019t\nenough for a strong VoE program. Ask yourself: have I created a culture where\nemployees feel empowered to share their feedback? Can they see the impact of\ntheir ideas? If the answer to either question is no, then your program won\u2019t\ndrive better business outcomes. A successful program that drives the business\nforward through continuous feedback will:\n\n  * **Promote sharing** : Get the ball rolling with short surveys to ask for ideas and get employees used to sharing their input. \n  * **Inspire trust** : Keep it anonymous, at least at first, so people feel comfortable. \n  * **Encourage honest feedback** : Welcome creative and fresh ideas, even if not all feedback is glowing.\n  * **Be proactive** : Share what you have heard from other sources to show employees their insights won\u2019t be wasted.\n\n  \nThis strategy is useful in team-centric models as it provides a multi-view\nframework to act on the constantly changing dynamics of your business. The\nresult? [61 percent](https://www.confirmit.com/Resources/Voice-of-the-\nEmployee/web-research-voe-mycustomer-employee-voice-cx-j1b/) of businesses\nthat have VoE programs led by CEOs, chief customer officers, and multiple\nstakeholders report improved employee engagement.\n\n**Learn More:[20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-\nemployee-engagement-ideas/)**\n\n## #3: Make It Actionable\n\nAre your frontline managers complaining that feedback is not actionable and\noutdated or the outcomes are not within their control? This is a roadblock for\nthe managers, who feel incapable of driving change; the employees, who think\nfeedback falls on deaf ears; and you, with no real progress for all your\neffort. Even with the best intentions, your programs are only valuable when\nthey create positive change.\n\nAs data is generated more often \u2013 and from more sources \u2013 it becomes even more\nimportant to focus on turning data into action. When looking at your program,\nfocus on:\n\n  * **Keeping communication lines open** : Don\u2019t feel like you should wait until the end of a project to share feedback. Keep decision makers in the loop throughout the process so they can act quickly on important issues. Your team can then address suggestions piecemeal, instead of all at once.\n  * **Getting feedback into the right hands** : Effective programs use feedback management platforms and analytic dashboards to automate the real-time delivery of data. Your changemakers will have even more autonomy to address problems if they can keep a pulse on feedback throughout.\n  * **Don\u2019t forget the past** : Don\u2019t just collect new data! Connect the dots between earlier feedback and new suggestions to have a better understanding of the issues that are consistently popping up for your employees.\n\n  \nUsing employee feedback to bring organizational change isn\u2019t easy, but it\nhelps teams make smarter decisions that ultimately lead to success. If you\ninvest the time and effort to make strong VoE programs part of your company\nculture, you\u2019ll be able to elevate your employee experience and improve the\nentire business.\n\n[ ![](/images/share-icon/share-linkedin-icon.svg)\n](http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2F3-ways-to-improve-your-employee-engagement-\nstrategy%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dhrtln&title=3+Ways+to+Improve+Your+Employee+Engagement+Strategy\n\"Share this Articles on LinkedIn\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-\ntwitter_icon.svg)\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=3+Ways+to+Improve+Your+Employee+Engagement+Strategy&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2F3-ways-to-improve-your-employee-engagement-\nstrategy%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dtwitter.com&hashtags=&via=_hrtechnologist\n\"Share this Articles on Twitter\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share_facebook-\nicon.svg)\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2F3-ways-to-improve-your-employee-engagement-\nstrategy%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dfacebook.com\n\"Share this Articles on Facebook\") [ ![whatsup-\nicon](https://images.martechadvisor.com/images/uploads/wa-logo-w.svg)\n](https://web.whatsapp.com/send?text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2F3-ways-to-improve-your-employee-engagement-\nstrategy%2F%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dwhatsapp.com\n\"Share this Articles on WhatsApp\") [ ![](/images/share-icon/share-outline-\nemail-icon.svg) ](mailto:?subject=3 Ways to Improve Your Employee Engagement\nStrategy&body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrtechnologist.com%2Farticles%2Femployee-\nengagement%2F3-ways-to-improve-your-employee-engagement-\nstrategy%2F%3Futm_medium%3Demail%26utm_campaign%3Dsocialicons%26utm_source%3Dmta_socialicons\n\"Share this Articles via Email\")\n\n### __Did you find this useful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSubmit Answer\n\n## Editor\u2019s Picks on [Employee Engagement ](/category/employee-engagement/\n\"Employee Engagement\")\n\n  * [ ![20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/160x80/images/uploads/content_images/cover20freshemployeeengagementideasfor2020_5dd4e96253adc.png) ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-engagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\n####  [ 20 Fresh Employee Engagement Ideas for 2020\n](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/fresh-employee-\nengagement-ideas/?zd_source=editors_pick)\n\nAre your employees tired of the same old employee engagement activities?

As the year comes to a\nclose and the attention shifts to 2020, HR professionals have been thinking\nabout a lot of different topics.  Some of those include employee engagement,\nremote work, social capital, and recruitment.  Having said that, the HR\nExchange Network has written several articles this month on these topics in an\nattempt to provide HR professionals with the best knowledge available.  Our\ncontributors also spent much of the month providing real-life examples from\nwhich to learn.  As we transition into 2020, here are the Top 10 HR Articles\nof December 2019.\n\n# Best of December 2019\n\n  1. **C-Suite HR Jobs Growing**\n\nThe C-Suite is the very top of the organization.  Nearly every leader wants to\nmake his or her way to one the coveted spots with an organization.  Not too\nlong ago, the opportunity was limited.  There simply weren't enough C-level\njobs available.  That's starting to shift.  This article takes a look at new\nresearch from LinkedIn and how HR professionals can make their way into the\nC-Suite.  [Click here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nacquisition/news/c-suite-hr-jobs-growing) for more.\n\n  2. **Why Employees Aren 't Completing Your Engagement Surveys**\n\nThe employee engagement survey is as much an art as it is a science.\nRegardless of how often you run the program, it involves attention to detail\nin the design and flow of your survey questionnaire. This is often backed up\nby a robust internal communications campaign ensuring teams are aware of the\nactivity, how to complete it, and why it's important.  It's a comprehensive\nprocess requiring great input from your HR team, which is why it can be\nfrustrating when response rates fail to meet expectations. However, with the\nright how-to advice and partners businesses can simplify the entire process,\nunlock deeper insights, and lift response rates.  Qualtrics' Steve Bennetts\nexplains [here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/articles/why-employees-arent-completing-your-engagement-surveys).\n\n  3. **The Employee Activated Culture and Its Benefits**\n\nCould employee engagement be a thing of the past? Could it give way to a new\nculture-based strategy?  The answer to the first question is:  no.  Employee\nEngagement isn't going anywhere.  The answer to the second question is a bit\nmore complex.  Why?  It's because of the new strategy mentioned above; a\nconcept referred to as the employee activated culture.  Read more\n[here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-\nengagement/articles/employee-activated-culture-and-its-benefits).\n\n  4. **Training for Confidence**\n\nConfidence is a soft skill many forget exists, but it's a necessary one for\nworkers to have in today's environment.  HR Exchange Network columnist Dr.\nJeanette Winters takes a look at the skill through the eyes of a real\nsituation she recently encountered.  [Click\nhere](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/employee-engagement/columns/training-\nfor-confidence) to read the article.\n\n  5. **Converting Candidates to Hire with Video Job Ads**\n\nAll talent acquisition and human resources professional are looking to prove\nreturn on investment to their organization's leadership. When HR spends on\nrecruitment advertising, they need results. Dollars must equal new hires. The\nlower the cost per hire, the happier everyone is, including the CFO. In order\nto locate quality candidates and effectively convert the best applicants to\ngreat hires, it's not enough to list responsibilities and qualifications. HR\nhas to sell!  What better way to do that, according to DigiMe's Lindsay\nStanton, then video job ads.  Read more\n[here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nacquisition/columns/converting-candidates-to-hire-with-video-job-ads).\n\n  6. **Finding the Bridge People**\n\nWe already know that it is essential that organizations hire the smartest,\nmost capable people possible. However, this isn't enough. Organizations must\nalso ensure that individuals are relationally positioned for optimal success.\nIn other words, bringing in the best people is only part of the solution.\nFirms must also bring out the best in people. This means, that people need to\nbe positioned to leverage what they know. Or at least, positioned to find what\nthey need, as they need it.  Amazon Web Services Michael Arena says the best\nway to do that is by unleashing the potential of social capital to find the\norganization's bridge people.  [Click\nhere](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/people-analytics/columns/finding-the-\nbridge-people) to read more on the topic.\n\n  7. **Remote Work Stats You Need To Know**\n\nRemote work was inevitable.  Given the technology landscape that's developed\nover the last decade or so, it was destined to become not only desirable by\nmore employees, but required by them too.  It almost goes hand-in-hand with\nflexible scheduling; this desire by workers to not only work from somewhere\nother than an office, but to work on their own time.  International Workplace\nGroup (IWG) says 80% of employees say they would turn down an employment offer\nthat didn't offer flexible working.  Want to know more?  [Click\nhere](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-tech/news/remote-work-stats-you-\nneed-to-know) to see more stats related to remote work.\n\n  8. **State of HR - By the Numbers**\n\nImagine you were sitting on a panel focused on answering the big questions in\nthe HR space.  The moderator opens the conversation with some quick statements\nor statistics and then turns to the questions.  The moderator calls on you\nfirst and says, \"If you were to define the current state of affairs within the\nHR space, how would you answer that question?\"  How  _would_  you answer the\nquestion?  In an attempt to find consensus on the topic, the HR Exchange\nNetwork turned to its audience of 800,000-plus HR professionals to get the\nanswer.  See their responses [here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/shared-\nservices/news/state-of-hr-by-the-numbers).\n\n  9. **International Hiring Strategy**\n\nIn today's business world, there is more pressure than ever to maintain a high\nrate of growth and reach new revenue goals. And growth usually means hiring.\nThe work of HR is an important part of that work, especially where fast-\ngrowing companies are concerned. There are many reasons why going beyond\nborders and hiring talent internationally can help a company reach its\nobjectives.  For more information on how to hire internationally and what the\nstrategy can look like, [click here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-\ntalent-management/articles/international-hiring-strategy).\n\n  10. **The Paradox of Unlearning to Optimize Performance and Drive Productivity**\n\nIn this digital world where enterprises are adapting to not only significant\nchanges in the market, but also experiencing a dramatic acceleration in those\nbusiness deviations, the capacity to be proactive truly determines the have\nand have nots of the business world.  That said, a new skill is becoming vital\nto all, not just HR professionals. The capacity to unlearn.  Atrium Health's\nSebastien Girard explains more [here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-\ntalent-management/articles/the-paradox-of-unlearning-to-optimize-performance-\nand-drive-productivity).\n\n> NEXT:  [Top 10 HR Articles of\n> 2019](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/shared-services/articles/top-10-hr-\n> articles-of-2019)\n\n\n\n**_Want more content faster?

So who needs clunky, time-\nconsuming employee surveys? You do. For decades, having regular employee\nopinion surveys has been on evidence-based lists of high-performance HR\npractices. And internal research at Facebook suggests that it would be a big\nmistake to abandon them, for three reasons: They're still great predictors of\nbehavior, they give employees the chance to feel heard, and they're actually a\nvehicle for changing behavior.\n\n![mar18-14-hbr-vincent-tsui-analytics-\ndata-02](/resources/images/article_assets/2018/03/mar18-14-hbr-vincent-tsui-\nanalytics-data-02.jpg)  \nvincent tsui for hbr\n\n[Leer en espa\u00f1ol](/2018/03/employee-surveys-are-still-one-of-the-best-ways-to-\nmeasure-engagement?language=es)\n\nOnce upon a time, surveys were a staple for every leader to solicit feedback\nand every company to assess engagement. But now, surveys are starting to look\nlike diesel trucks collecting dust in the age of electric cars. Companies are\nusing cool new machine-learning algorithms that crunch big data to measure\nemployee engagement through [email response\ntimes](https://medium.com/@duncanjwatts/the-organizational-\nspectroscope-7f9f239a897c) and [network connections outside one\u2019s core\nteam](/2014/11/a-primer-on-measuring-employee-engagement), and forecast\nturnover risk by [tracking signals](https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/11/data-\nfirst-tools-score-1-8-billion-to-make-us-workers-super-productive/) like how\noften employees update their resumes. Who needs a clunky, time-consuming\nsurvey where some employees only tell you what you want to hear, and others\ndon\u2019t bother to respond at all?\n\nYou do.\n\nFor decades, having regular employee opinion surveys has been on evidence-\nbased lists of [high-performance HR\npractices](http://amj.aom.org/content/38/3/635.short). Our internal research\nat Facebook suggests that for three reasons, it would be a big mistake to\nabandon them today.\n\n**1\\. Surveys are still great predictors of behavior.**\n\nAt Facebook, we\u2019ve found that simply asking our people how long they intend to\nstay is more than twice as accurate at foretelling their future turnover than\nmachine-learning forecasts by an industry leader in predictive analytics.\n\nWe learn a lot from surveys even when people don\u2019t participate. People who\ndon\u2019t fill out either of our two annual surveys are 2.6 times more likely to\nleave in the next six months.\n\n**2\\. Surveys give employees the chance to feel heard.**\n\nNot having a regular survey sends a clear message: you don\u2019t care about\npeople\u2019s opinions. The act of filling out a survey gives them a specific\nchannel for expressing voice. At Facebook, even though we can often gain the\ninsights we need from a sample, we often invite the whole company to\nparticipate so they have a chance to contribute to the conversation. Passive\nmonitoring loses that employee feeling of active ownership.\n\nDifferential participation rates tell us what issues matter most to our\npeople: 95% complete the engagement survey, more than two-thirds fill out our\nannual diversity survey, and more than half do our benefits survey. And it\nturns out that employees value having a say [even if they don\u2019t get their\nway](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp1803_3). When we\nsend out a survey, we get a surprising volume of write-in comments: on\naverage, 61% of our people submit their own feedback and suggestions, and each\nperson touches on (on average) five distinct topics. It\u2019s clear that people\ntake the survey seriously and want to be heard. And knowing that they won\u2019t\nadopt every idea, leaders go out of their way to show that they still value\nthe input. As a fun way to reward participation, some of our leaders have come\nto work dressed in a costume of their teams\u2019 choice when they reached a 100%\nresponse rate!\n\n**3\\. Surveys are a vehicle for changing behavior.**\n\nWhen you ask people for their input and insights, you aren\u2019t just learning\nfrom them. You\u2019re also influencing them. Psychologists find that asking\nquestions can change behavior. Survey people on whether they\u2019d like to\n[volunteer](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/31/3/540/1800476)\nthree hours for the American Cancer Society, and volunteering rates spike from\n4% to 31%. Poll people about whether they\u2019re planning to [buy a new\ncomputer](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/20/1/46/1902172) in\nthe next six months, and they become 18% more likely to do it. Survey NCAA\nbasketball ticketholders on whether they intend to [show up at next week\u2019s\ngame](http://www.theatlantic.com/sponsored/lyft-2017/making-the-ask/1688/),\nand their attendance jumps from 76% to 85%.\n\nPart of the effect is consistency: saying yes creates a commitment and many\npeople follow through. But even people who say no are more likely to shift\ntheir behavior, because questions prompt reflection. As long as the behavior\nis desirable, some of them will end up convincing themselves to do it.\n\nOn our engagement survey at Facebook, we often try out new questions with\ndifferent samples of people. In one recent survey, we asked 30% of our people\nwhether or not they were personally committed to improving their experience\nworking here. We weren\u2019t trying to influence their behavior, but they ended up\nbeing 12% more likely than their peers to request a curated list of additional\nresources and tools to help them become more engaged at Facebook \u2014 and that\nwas true whether their original answer was yes or no.\n\nSmart technology and big data will continue to help us figure out what matters\nmost to our people. But that will make surveys more important, not less. In an\nage where more employees are afraid that Big Brother is watching and companies\nhave the tools to observe more than ever before, running a survey can signal\nthat Big Brother is still human.\n\n* * *\n\n[Scott Judd](/search?term=scott%20judd&search_type=search-all) is the head of\nPeople Analytics at Facebook.\n\n* * *\n\nEric O'Rourke is the People Growth & Survey Analytics lead at Facebook.\n\n* * *\n\n![](/resources/images/article_assets/2014/08/110-Adam_Grant.jpg)\n\n[Adam Grant](/search?term=adam%20grant&search_type=search-all) is a professor\nat Wharton and the author of Originals and Give and Take.\n\n* * *\n\n###### This article is about [TALENT MANAGEMENT](/topic/talent-management)\n\n__Follow this topic\n\n__Following\n\nRelated Topics:\n\n  * [Analytics](/topic/analytics)\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\n#### Partner Center\n\n[Coronavirus](/insight-center/coronavirus) [Magazine](/magazine)\n[Popular](/most-popular) [Topics](/topics) [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n[Video](/video) [Store](/store) [The Big Idea](/big-ideas) [Visual\nLibrary](/visual-library) [Reading Lists](/reading-lists) [Case\nSelections](/case-selections)\n\n[![Harvard Business Review Home](/resources/css/images/hbr_logo.svg)](/)\n\n[**Subscribe**](/subscribe)\n\n###### Explore HBR\n\n  * [The Latest](/the-latest)\n  * [Most Popular](/most-popular)\n  * [All Topics](/topics)\n  * [Magazine Archive](/magazine)\n  * [The Big Idea](/big-ideas)\n  * [Reading Lists](/reading-lists)\n  * [Case Selections](/case-selections)\n  * [Video](/video)\n  * [Podcasts](/podcasts)\n  * [Webinars](/webinars)\n  * [Visual Library](/visual-library)\n  * [My Library](/my-library)\n  * [Newsletters](/email-newsletters)\n  * [HBR Ascend](https://hbrascend.org/)\n\n###### HBR Store\n\n  * [Article Reprints](/store/articles)\n  * [Books](/store/books)\n  * [Cases](/store/case-studies)\n  * [Collections](/store/collections)\n  * [Magazine Issues](/store/magazine-issues)\n  * [HBR Guide Series](/store/landing/guides)\n  * [HBR 20-Minute Managers](/store/landing/20-minute-managers)\n  * [HBR Emotional Intelligence Series](/store/landing/emotional-intelligence-series)\n  * [HBR Must Reads](/store/landing/mustreads)\n  * [Tools](/store/tools)\n\n###### About HBR\n\n  * [Contact Us](/contact-us)\n  * [Advertise with Us](/hbr-advertising-sales)\n  * [Information for Booksellers/Retailers](/booksellers-retailers)\n  * [Masthead](/about-hbr)\n  * [Global Editions](/global-editions)\n  * [Media Inquiries](/media-inquiries)\n  * [Guidelines for Authors](/guidelines-for-authors-web)\n  * [HBR Analytic Services](/hbr-analytic-services)\n\n###### HBR Subscriber Assistance\n\n  * [Subscribe](/subscribe)\n  * [Subscriber Help](/subscriber-help)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.274.3214](tel:+18002743214)  \n[harvard@cdsfulfillment.com](mailto:harvard@cdsfulfillment.com)  \n[hbr.org/subscriberservices](/subscriberservices)\n\n  * International:  \n[+44.1858.438.412](tel:+441858438412)  \n[(Asia Pacific: +61.2.9158.6127)](tel:+61291586127)  \n[hbr@subscription.co.uk](mailto:hbr@subscription.co.uk)  \n[subscription.co.uk/hbr/help](https://www.subscription.co.uk/hbr/help)\n\n###### HBR.ORG Customer Assistance\n\n  * [Help Center](/help-customer-service-home)\n  * U.S./Canada:  \n[800.988.0886](tel:+18009880886)\n\n  *   * International:  \n[617.783.7500](tel:+16177837500)\n\n  * Email:  \n[customerservice@harvardbusiness.org](mailto:customerservice@harvardbusiness.org)\n\n  * [Copyright Permissions](/permissions)\n\n###### Follow HBR\n\n  * __[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/HBR)\n  * __[Twitter](http://twitter.com/HarvardBiz)\n  * __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/harvard-business-review?trk=biz-companies-cym)\n  * __[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/harvard_business_review/?hl=en)\n  * __[Your Newsreader](http://feeds.hbr.org/harvardbusiness/)\n\n![Harvard Business Publishing](/resources/images/2018/new_logo_May11.png)\n\n  * [About Us](/corporate/about)\n  * [Careers](/corporate/careers)\n  * [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n  * [Copyright Information](/corporate/copyright)\n  * [Trademark Policy](http://trademark.harvard.edu/pages/trademark-notice)\n\n  \n\nHarvard Business Publishing:\n\n  * [Higher Education](http://hbsp.harvard.edu/)\n  * [Corporate Learning](http://www.harvardbusiness.org)\n  * [Harvard Business Review](http://hbr.org/)\n  * [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu)\n\nCopyright (C) 2020 Harvard Business School Publishing.
