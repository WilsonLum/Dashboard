An ideal candidate would have a\ntrack record of handling a wide portfolio of human resources responsibilities,\nfrom administering benefits and managing the employee evaluation process to\nfostering a workplace that values diversity and inclusion. At _Mother Jones_ ,\nthe HR director advocates for both employees and employer, and balances both\ninterests.\n\nYou\u2019ll support the managers in our newsroom; the journalists whose work\nappears across our website, magazine, podcasts, social media channels, and\nvideos; and department heads for _Mother Jones_ \u2019 fundraising, technology,\nadvertising, and business operations teams.\n\nAbout half of _Mother Jones_ employees are represented by a labor union. The\nHR director is a non-union position.\n\nIdeal candidates will have an interest in the news industry or the areas that\n_Mother Jones_ covers.

Manage a full suite of employee benefits and related insurance plans, including overseeing open enrollment and managing 401(k) plans, vendors, digital systems, and employee communication\n  * Develop and administer HR policies and provide guidance to staff regarding labor law, collective bargaining agreements, and human resources best practices, as necessary\n  * Coordinate employee development through facilitation of training, evaluation process, and general coaching\n  * Coordinate the payroll process with accounting\n  * Support the COO and CFO in high-level HR work through research, documentation, and analysis\n  * Manage the HR generalist/facilities manager\n\n**Experience**\n\n  * BA/BS in a business field, or equivalent work experience\n  * Experience working with a labor union is strongly desired\n  * At least five years of human resource management\n  * Experience as a human resources director or comparable senior-level position strongly desired\n  * Knowledge of California labor law, and experience with New York labor law and/or labor law in other states is a plus\n  * Proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite\n\n**Skills**\n\n  * Strong understanding of the interview process, benefits administration, labor law, payroll, and other HR functions\n  * Demonstrated experience working with diverse teams\n  * Experience supporting remote teams\n  * A high comfort level with adapting to evolving technology systems\n  * Superior communication skills and time management\n  * Highly organized, with meticulous attention to detail\n  * Strong emotional intelligence\n  * The ability to carry confidence, understand nuance, and maintain professionalism at all times\n\nPlease submit a cover letter and resume.

The AWS-hosted cloud solution and\nServiceNow\u00ae were jointly selected as part of a new Employee Shared Services\ninitiative designed to streamline and improve overall services to its global\nworkforce.\n\nDesigned to complement ServiceNow\u2019s existing digital channels (i.e.: self-\nservice portal, email, chat), the solution offers a deep CTI and [call center\nintegration with ServiceNow\u2019s\u00ae HR Service\nDelivery](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.3clogic.com%2Fservicenow%2F&esheet=52199493&newsitemid=20200407005056&lan=en-\nUS&anchor=call+center+integration+with+ServiceNow%26%238217%3Bs%26%23174%3B+HR+Service+Delivery&index=2&md5=c7ac6d7c0f28ec769276cfaa032c1ccb)\nplatform to improve agent efficiency through the automated distribution of\nemployee calls or HR inquiries.\n\nThe 3CLogic solution with ServiceNow\u2019s Employee Workflows platform will\ninclude:\n\n  *  _Telephony integration and agent presence synchronization with ServiceNow\u2019s digital channels_ to allow HR staff to manage all employee engagements from a single user interface.\n  *  _Natively integrated IVR Call Flow Designer_ to enable supervisors to easily create and manage the employee journey with ServiceNow-based dynamic call routing to the most qualified agent.\n  *  _Automatic HR case creation_ for employee-submitted voicemails to improve awareness and reduce agent response time.\n  *  _Integrated reporting and call analytics with ServiceNow_ to track agent assignments across channels and derive consolidated insights.\n\nWhile digital channels are well suited to handle or automate simple inquiries,\nemployees continue to rely on a personalized, one-on-one agent experience over\nthe phone to handle more complex, sensitive, or urgent inquiries. In fact,\nrecent research 1 revealed 74% of globally surveyed individuals called a\ncontact center in 2019 for assistance.\n\n\u201cThe HR Department handles a wide variety of employee inquiries, from\nsensitive information to recruitment and professional development\nopportunities. The nature of these calls tends to be time sensitive, so it is\ncritical for the telephony platform to direct the caller to the right agent,\u201d\nsays Denis Seynhaeve, 3CLogic\u2019s CEO. \u201cWith the natively-integrated IVR\ndesigner for ServiceNow, employee details are collected upfront and callers\nare automatically routed to the most qualified agent, ensuring more time is\nspent handling the inquiry and less spent waiting in line.\u201d\n\nThe manufacturing firm also plans to extend the ServiceNow certified cloud\ncall center capabilities to its IT and customer service teams leveraging\nServiceNow\u2019s ITSM and CSM suites, with the potential to expand into over 20\ncountries.\n\nAbout 3CLogic\n\n3CLogic is a leading cloud contact center platform modernizing enterprise\ncommunications with their employees and customers.

Olson/Getty Images)\n\nAs CHRO at Verizon, Christy Pambianchi is accustomed to triaging disasters of\nall sorts; she points to cyber attacks, epidemics like the Ebola virus and the\nannual occurrence of tornadoes, earthquakes and hurricanes.\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/A-New-Era-of-\nLeadership_bambianchi-150x150.jpg)\n\nChristy Pambianchi\n\nBut one skill she developed years ago is currently being tested to the max:\nher ability to quickly and effectively respond to global emergencies and\nnetwork disruptions, such as the coronavirus. Pambianchi serves as the liaison\nbetween the senior crisis leadership team and the business continuity and\nevent management team at the telecommunications company that employs 135,000\nglobal workers (including 120,000 in the U.S.).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have a well-established business continuity and event management set of\nprotocols,\u201d she says, adding that she has more than a decade worth of\nexperience building crisis response infrastructure and protocols. \u201cI oversee\nwhat the business continuity and event management team is doing, what we need\nto pull into the senior team and [ensure] we have the right people involved\nand right cadence for resolving the issue.\u201d\n\n[**Read all of _HRE_ \u2018s coronavirus coverage\nhere.**](https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/\n\"https://hrexecutive.com/category/coronavirus/\")\n\nCoronavirus ranks among the most difficult challenges Pambianchi has faced,\nforcing her and her HR team to wear multiple hats. Unlike most natural or\nmanmade disasters that are localized, the coronavirus is affecting the entire\ncompany at the same time and poses a critical health threat to employees and\nstakeholders around the world.\n\n**Minimizing Fear**\n\nAt the end of February, the company activated its corporate crisis response\nlevel. Since then, Pambianchi has met daily with C-suite executives to ground\nthem in facts and address the unknown\u2014how to prepare for and respond in real\ntime to an event they can\u2019t control. Likewise, she checks in multiple times\neach day with the company\u2019s operations and business continuity and event\nmanagement teams to stay on top of new decisions, changes or additional\nsocietal restrictions and regulations made by various governments,\nmunicipalities and cities around the world.\n\nUnder her guidance, employees receive daily news broadcasts about the pandemic\nand the company\u2019s responses, can email questions to an HR inbox and log onto a\nwebpage that describes the company\u2019s policies and provides coronavirus\nupdates.\n\nWithin a 10-day span, she says, the number of remote workers at the company\nsoared from 4,000 to more than 115,000. To add to the chaos, very few, if any,\nleaders have experience with managing virtual or distributed teams. So, HR is\nin the midst of developing an entire curriculum about how to effectively lead\nvirtual employees.\n\n**See also:[Bersin webinar-Will coronavirus spark the new remote\nworkforce?](https://hrexecutive.com/is-coronavirus-the-spark-of-the-new-\nremote-workforce/)**\n\nAround mid-March, HR created a new caregiver-leave program where employees can\napply to receive up to eight weeks at full pay, which then drops to 60% of pay\nfor up to six more months.\n\nMeanwhile, she says, more than 25,000 employees have participated in one-hour\nwebinars Verizon put together on a broad range of timely issues: how to ensure\nteams have the right tools, distribute work assignments, stay in touch with\nteam members and effectively run virtual meetings. HR has also implemented\ncounseling and support programs for leaders, who can then pass on what they\u2019ve\nlearned to direct reports.\n\nBased on everything she has learned through this work, Pambianchi says,\nemployees are simply afraid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking a lot to our supervisors about being patient with people,\u201d she\nsays, explaining that, besides contracting the virus, many are worried about\nloved ones becoming sick and not being able to care for them. \u201cWe\u2019re teaching\nour leaders how to run good virtual teams, stay connected to people, lead in\nan agile way and know that people are pretty stressed out right now.\u201d\n\n**Guideposts**\n\nPambianchi is currently experiencing her own brand of stress. While working\n12-hour days from home, she oversees the needs of her four children, who are\nalso home-bound and require attention, even the two oldest who attend college.\nAs a self-admitted extrovert, Pambianchi says, staying physically isolated\nfrom her peers and learning new ways to be virtually effective is a huge\nadjustment.\n\n\u201cJust like everybody else, I\u2019m going through this transition,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s\nlike taking your own medicine\u2014[but] that\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPambianchi has managed to keep her sanity intact by pausing and self-\nreflecting, something she recommends to all HR professionals. Ask yourself the\nfollowing questions: Where are you personally? What are the values of the\nfirm? What\u2019s the mission of the company? What are your values and mission? She\nsays that can help guide you and your leaders in terms of how you think about\nand respond to this crisis.\n\n**Related:[ 8 benefits employers should zero in on during the COVID-19\npandemic](https://hrexecutive.com/8-benefits-employers-should-zero-in-on-\nduring-the-coronavirus-pandemic/)**\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling professionally isolated, reach out to HR communities, online\nor in person, she says.

A good CFO could save a company; a bad one\nmight bury it. The covid-19 pandemic presents a different challenge\u2014and\nhighlights the role of another corporate function, often unfairly dismissed as\nsoft. Never have more firms needed a hard-headed HR boss.\n\nThe duties of chief people officers, as top human-resources executives are\nsometimes called, are critical. They must keep employees healthy; maintain\nmorale; oversee a historic remote-working experiment; and consider whether,\nwhen and how to lay workers off. Their in-trays are bulging.\n\nOnce derided as \u201cpay and parties\u201d managers, by the early 1990s HR chiefs\nturned to compliance, keeping firms out of the courts (and newspapers). A\nsubsequent string of corporate imbroglios raised their status, notes Patrick\nWright of the University of South Carolina. Executive-pay scandals in the\n2000s at firms such as WorldCom and Tyco got them more involved in\nremuneration. A decade later bungled successions at giants like HP, a printer-\nmaker, left them with a bigger say in filling top jobs. More recently they\nhave dealt with firms\u2019 often very public \u201cme too\u201d troubles.\n\nAs recruiting and retaining skilled workers became CEOs\u2019 big concern\u2014four-\nfifths now fret about skill shortages, up from half in 2012\u2014HR heads\u2019 desks\nmoved closer to the corner office. Today many reside right next to the boss.\nShareholders are inviting more outside HR chiefs onto boards. In America\nsalaries remain lower than CFOs\u2019 pay but have risen about 20% faster since\n2010 (see chart).\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-\nedition/20200328_WBC877.png)\n\nA higher profile entails new expectations. HR was once the domain of history\ngraduates and masters in labour relations; nowadays plenty hold business\ndegrees. Although most firms recruit them from HR jobs, more are choosing\noutsiders or unconventional candidates. Russell Reynolds Associates, an\nexecutive-search firm, found that HR heads appointed to Fortune 100 companies\nin 2016-19 were around 50% likelier than earlier hires to have worked abroad,\nin general management or finance.\n\nBefore covid-19 tight labour markets and millennial empowerment forced\nemployers to think about getting the most out of workers, says Dane Holmes, a\nformer human-capital head at Goldman Sachs who now runs Eskalera, an HR-\nanalytics firm. Diane Gherson, in charge of HR at IBM, overhauled the\ncomputing giant\u2019s performance management with big data. Algorithms challenge\nmanagers\u2019 instincts on pay and promotion and alert her team when employees are\nat risk of fleeing (often before they realise it themselves).\n\nThe pandemic makes such \u201cpeople analytics\u201d more relevant. Beth Galetti, Ms\nGherson\u2019s opposite number at Amazon and an engineer with no prior HR\nexperience, oversees 1,000 developers working exclusively on HR tech. The\ne-commerce titan\u2019s earlier investment in digital induction for new hires is\npaying off. \u201cWe on-boarded 1,700 new corporate employees on Monday [March\n16th] alone,\u201d Ms Galetti reports.\n\nCovid-19 may lead more HR chiefs to adopt such systems. Right now most have\nmore pressing problems. Mala Singh, chief people officer at EA, a maker of\nvideo games, represents the C-suite in its pandemic-response group. This\noccupies 60-70% of her (long) day. Her team has been getting desks, computers,\neven noise-cancelling headphones for home-workers. A bigger concern is\nbalancing jobs with child care. Ms Singh told the caregivers on staff to take\nas much time as they need to adapt without using up paid leave. She is\ndigitally monitoring employee sentiment, particularly anxiety. In a creative\nbusiness like EA\u2019s, stress about family \u201cdoes not enable productive work\u201d, she\nexplains.\n\nMany companies outside the knowledge economy face tougher choices. HR leaders\nmust strike a balance between a firm\u2019s professed purpose, which these days\noften involves treating staff well, and the bottom line, observes Dan Kaplan\nof Korn Ferry, a consultancy. The instinct is to cut costs through mass lay-\noffs. Rather than slash payrolls willy-nilly, says Bill Schaninger of\nMcKinsey, another consultancy, good HR heads can try to reconfigure company\nwork flows: what needs to be done by whom, what can be automated and what\nrequires people to share the same space. Some workers who at first appear\nredundant may be redeployed or reskilled.\n\nThe smartest HR-ers at the doughtiest firms are already gazing beyond the\nflattened curve. Though not quite recruiting\u2014times are too uncertain\u2014Ms\nGherson has begun to groom rivals\u2019 talent. Now that everyone is working from\nhome, she says, no one is listening in on their calls. For an HR chief, \u201cit\u2019s\nthe perfect opportunity.\u201d\u25a0\n\nThis article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the\nheadline \"The importance of people people\"\n\n[Reuse this\ncontent](https://s100.copyright.com/AppDispatchServlet?publisherName=economist&publication=economist&title=The%20coronavirus%20crisis%20thrusts%20corporate%20HR%20chiefs%20into%20the%20spotlight&publicationDate=2020-03-26&contentID=%2Fcontent%2Fconi4igm9derhmsvtk0hu32oie9tc4os&type=A&orderBeanReset=TRUE)[The\nTrust Project](https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist)\n\n## More from Business\n\n### [Bartleby  \nJobs for jailbirds](/business/2020/04/04/jobs-for-jailbirds)\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-\nedition/20200404_WBD001_0.jpg)\n\n[Business](/business/)\n\n### [Great white night  \nGovernments are once again splurging to keep big companies\nafloat](/business/2020/04/03/governments-are-once-again-splurging-to-keep-big-\ncompanies-afloat)\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-\nedition/20200404_WBP003_0.jpg)\n\n[Business](/business/)\n\n### [Up in the air  \nBoeing ponders its bail-out options](/business/2020/04/03/boeing-ponders-its-\nbail-out-options)\n\n![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20200404_WBP504.jpg)\n\n[Business](/business/)\n\n## The best of our journalism, handpicked each day\n\nSign up to our free daily newsletter, The Economist today\n\n[Sign up now](https://my.economist.com/user#newsletter)\n\n![A hand holding a newspaper](/static/illustration/newsletter-signup.svg)\n\n  * [Subscribe](https://subscription.economist.com/DE/EngCore/EcomNewArticle/Footer)\n  * [Group subscriptions](https://groupsubscriptions.economist.com)\n  * [Help](https://www.economist.com/help/home)\n\n## Keep updated\n\n  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist)\n  * [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist)\n  * [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/theeconomist)\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-economist)\n  * [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/economistmagazine)\n  * [RSS](https://www.economist.com/rss)\n\nPublished since September 1843 to take part in _\u201ca severe contest between\nintelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance\nobstructing our progress.\u201d_\n\n## Apps & media\n\n  * [The Economist apps](https://www.economist.com/apps)\n  * [Economist Films](https://films.economist.com)\n  * [Podcasts](https://www.economist.com/blogs/podcasts)\n\n## Other publications\n\n  * [1843 Magazine](https://www.1843magazine.com)\n  * [The World in](https://theworldin.economist.com/)\n  * [The World If](https://www.economist.com/worldif18)\n\n## The Economist\n\n  * [About](https://www.economist.com/about-the-economist)\n  * [Advertise](http://marketingsolutions.economist.com)\n  * [Press centre](https://press.economist.com)\n\n## The Economist Group\n\n  * [Economist Group](https://www.economistgroup.com/)\n  * [The Economist Store](https://shop.economist.com)\n  * [Careers](https://economistgroupcareers.com)\n  * [Which MBA?](https://www.economist.com/whichmba)\n  * [GMAT Tutor](https://gmat.economist.com/)\n  * [GRE Tutor](https://gre.economist.com/)\n  * [Executive Jobs](http://jobs.economist.com/)\n  * [Executive Education Navigator](https://execed.economist.com)\n\n  * [Terms of Use](https://www.economist.com/legal/terms-of-use)\n  * [Privacy](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/privacy)\n  * [Cookie Policy](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/Cookies_information.html)\n  * [Manage Cookies](https://l3.evidon.com/site/2254/668/6?lang=en-gb)\n  * [Accessibility](https://www.economist.com/help/accessibilitypolicy)\n  * [Modern Slavery Statement](https://www.economistgroup.com/results_and_governance/governance/guiding_principles.html)\n  * [Do Not Sell My Personal Information](http://privacyportal.economist.com/)\n\nCopyright \u00a9 The Economist Newspaper Limited 2020.

As advisors to brands, we are responsible for\nunderstanding how digital technology impacts our creative landscape and how\nour clients can stay relevant. We are identifying consumer trends and seeking\nout data more quickly and intelligently, evolving and creating demand in the\nface of consumers\u2019 changing expectations. These are reflected in the digital-\ndriven solutions we are launching and offering our clients.\n\nAs a leader, this applies to our business focus too. By working as a team, we\ncan harness our strengths for Forefront and our clients\u2019 brand purpose in\ntoday\u2019s world. We continue to reassess and fine-tune our approach towards our\nown employees, learn what appeals to them and what brings the best out of\nthem, while at the same time, tapping into my experience throughout this\nleadership journey to address any shortcomings.\n\n> ##### A leader who is ready for IR 4.0, or any emerging technology, is one\n> who is ready to adapt and evolve in ways that can better sustain and grow\n> the business.\n\n**#2 Elevate employees and the business simultaneously**\n\nBack when we started the business in 2004, we were a tight-knit team of four.\nAs we commit to growing and diversifying the business, we started to recognise\nthe importance of building an optimal environment for our Forefronteers, to\nnurture creative talents and enterprising spirits within the company. They, on\nthe other hand, have inspired us to enter new industries.\n\nGrowth can take many forms. We\u2019ve departed from having just a web-design\nfocus, to being a full-suite creative agency, to now, having solution-based\nsubsidiaries that serve the community with F&B offerings and real-estate\nservices. Had we not invested in empowering our employees to see the value in\ntheir creative perspectives and ideas, Forefront may not be where it is today,\nexpanding our reach across Southeast Asia and industries beyond advertising\nand marketing.\n\n**Q In your opinion, what are 2-3 evergreen leadership best practices?**\n\nPractise collective leadership, invest in human capital, and prioritise\nleadership development initiatives.\n\nTrust your employees and business unit leaders to execute your company vision\nand strategies with you. As a leader, it is important to observe, listen to,\nand communicate with the unique individuals in the team. As our company\nfocuses on building bigger teams and adding more business units, the last\nmistake we want to make is depersonalising our employees. With data and trends\npowerfully shaping the direction of our industries, we rely on our employees\nto help steer Forefront\u2019s ship in a transformative direction, and we don\u2019t\nwant to take them for granted.\n\n> ##### Trust your employees and business unit leaders to execute your company\n> vision and strategies with you.\n\nSo, having systems in place that can help identify the areas in which they can\ngrow and thrive is important. This includes encouraging employees to better\nthemselves through certified courses, enabling them to take the lead on large-\nscale projects, and having an open-door policy so interactions with employees\ncan be transparent and work issues can be tackled head-on.\n\nTo me, investing in human capital is a delicate balance of providing a\nstructured employee experience and maintaining good relationships with them.\nWhile we implement fun rewards systems to incentivise their good work and\nparticipation in company-wide activities, I also make sure I am approachable,\nas a CEO and team member, to our Forefronteers.\n\n**Q Given how rampantly leadership is being disrupted, what are we demanding\nfrom today\u2019s leaders?**\n\nLeaders should be open to adopting new mindsets, even if it bucks pre-existing\nbeliefs and long-held opinions. Industry experience and product knowledge will\ncontinue to have a valuable stake in companies, but leaders should recognise\nthe diverse perspectives younger employees have that contribute to overall\nbusiness growth.\n\nToday, we are prepared to depart from tried-and-true processes and thinking,\neven if they\u2019ve helped the business tremendously in the past. There\u2019s a reason\nwhy the recent meme-like phenomenon, the \u201cOK boomer\u201d retort, caught on to\nbecome such a viral phrase. Millennials and Generation Z are populating the\nworkforce, and they\u2019re not standing for a culture where their voices are\ndismissed. They also have more energy and passion to disrupt the industry and\nthe workplace, even if it means navigating uncertain outcomes.\n\nThese are things that continue to inspire me as we attract more talents to\njoin Forefront. I am very conscious about the need to be a versatile leader,\nand the need to take more leaps of faith, despite the ambiguity amid a\nchanging landscape.\n\n**Q Against this backdrop, what does the mindset of a good leader look like to\nyou?**\n\nA good leader keeps his or her employees informed in the decision-making\nprocess. We will approach an inflection point with regard to our relationship\nwith technology and insight-driven brand experiences. As we adapt and change,\nthe responsibility lies with the leader to be perceptive of changes, but it\u2019s\nalso a good leader\u2019s responsibility to ensure the company\u2019s direction is\naligned and understood consistently across all levels.\n\n> ##### A good leader keeps his or her employees informed in the decision-\n> making process.\n\nLeading by example is also important. I believe in producing work that serves\ncommunities as much it serves our businesses, as well as uplifting humanity\nthrough honest and quality work. It\u2019s a mindset that can only be inculcated\namong Forefronteers if I can show them how rewarding it is to serve beyond the\nself. Recognising this responsibility has allowed the company to stay\ngrounded, even as the company grows to become bigger in size.\n\n* * *\n\n_This interview was published in[Human Resources Online\u2019s January-February\n2020 edition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of the Singapore\nmagazine and will soon be published in the Q1 edition of the Malaysia\nmagazine._\n\n[![](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/26163836/hrsg_jan_feb20.jpg)](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/)\n\n\n\n_Photo / provided_\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

While Paychex Flex is a full suite of HR solutions, its open\nplatform delivers the flexibility that customers may need.\n\n**Pay-on-Demand:** Paychex customers can now grant employee access to earned\nwages before their scheduled payday thanks to a pay-on-demand solution. For\ncustomers who leverage this product, employees who enroll can request access\nto a portion of earned pay before the scheduled pay date and can then have\nthose funds deposited into a bank account, onto a debit card, into a mobile\nwallet, and more.\n\n**Help Center:** HR technology is a significant investment for any\norganization, making it critical that users easily understand how to use it as\npart of their normal workflow. The Paychex Flex Help Center gives users access\nto training resources and how-to tutorials within the application itself. It\nemploys natural language processing (NLP) and predictive learning to deliver a\nmore tailored, contextual experience. Customers have access to help materials\nin written, video, and tour-like deliverables and may choose which best suits\ntheir learning style.\n\n**Custom Dashboard:** Employees and administrative users can now tailor their\n[Paychex](http://hrtechnologist.com/news/performance-management-hcm/paychex-\nenhances-payroll-hr-with-new-solutions/) Flex dashboard experience by\nincorporating the information and tools most important to them. Users can\neither choose a layout built on persona-based dashboard templates or configure\ntheir own dashboard from scratch.\n\n**Document Management:** Paychex released its document management solution in\n2019 and has now added electronic signature capabilities to the tool.\nCustomers taking advantage of document management can now digitally capture\nsignatures for key company documentation, including Paychex forms and other\nuploaded business-related files. In addition to e-signature capture, customers\ncan also run on-demand audit reports that show the entire process, from the\ninitial log in through signature event. This additional reporting capability\ndelivers further signature verification and may help protect customers in\nresponding to legal challenges.\n\n**HR News:**[Benefitfocus Comes up With a New

_Nebula software release contains enhancements to the employee experience,\ncompliance updates, and new integrations through PlanSource Boost_\n\nORLANDO, Fla., March 25, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n[_PlanSource_](http://www.plansource.com/), a leading provider of cloud-based\nbenefits administration technology, today announced the launch of Nebula, the\ncompany's latest software release.  \n\nIn its first release of 2020, PlanSource is introducing enhancements to the HR\nAdministrator Experience, updates to the revolutionary PlanSource Boost\nprogram, a completely redesigned PlanSource Mobile App and more. The Nebula\nrelease was launched on March 12, 2020, to all PlanSource customers and\npartners.\n\nUpdates in the Nebula release incorporate feedback received directly from\nPlanSource customers and partners. Features focused on providing a more\nconvenient and streamlined experience for employees and HR teams include:  \n\n  *  **Updated PlanSource Mobile App** \u2013 PlanSource has had a mobile app for many years that allows employees to view their current benefits, store ID cards and receive messages from HR. The new version provides access to all the features that are available in the desktop view and also makes logging in easy via touch ID, facial recognition or a four-digit pin. Available in app stores in early April, the app allows employees to start, continue and finish the benefits shopping experience on any device.\n  *  **Text to Opt-In to Messaging \u2013** Employees now have an easier way to opt-in to receive messages from HR about their benefits, open enrollment reminders and emergency notifications. Employees simply text a keyword to opt-in to start receiving targeted text messages from their employer. \n  *  **Streamlined Employee View** \u2013 HR teams can now access a redesigned employee profile that is mobile responsive and prominently features meaningful information such as document request history, survey responses, stacked coverage details, subscriber ID and related tasks.\n  *  **Improved HR Workflow and Communications** \u2013 HR professionals need access to powerful tools and in-depth information with fewer clicks, so we've made it easier to search for employees, manage new hires and oversee Evidence of Insurability (EOI) requests. In addition, HR teams have more options when sending communications to new hires and employees with pending EOI requests.\n\nUpdates from the Nebula release focused on modernizing integrations with\ninsurance carriers include:  \n\n  *  **LIMRA Data Exchange Standards (LDEx)** \u2013 PlanSource has adopted new LIMRA Exchange Standards **,** the first set of data exchange standards focused on post-enrollment data for the employee benefits market. By creating consistency among EDI files across carriers, these standards make it easier to set up and manage EDI integrations with insurance carriers while reducing errors.\n  *  **Guardian Plan Configuration API Enhancements \u2013** With PlanSource Boost, PlanSource is modernizing its integrations with insurance carriers. The real-time API-based integration with [_Guardian Life_](https://www.guardianlife.com/) for plan configuration that was initially released in September has now been expanded:  \n\u25cb  The integration now supports dental, vision, basic life, basic AD&D and\nsupplemental health products such as cancer, accident and hospital indemnity.\nAPI integrations for all remaining products will be available in June.  \n\u25cb  In addition, the integration now supports customers with multiple benefit\neligibility classes where Guardian products are offered to various employee\ngroups within their workforce populations.  \nThe Plan Configuration API provides groundbreaking automation that will\nstreamline the setup and renewal process on the PlanSource platform by pulling\nrelevant customer information, product specifications and rates directly from\nGuardian's system, reducing customer effort and time while improving data\nquality. [_Learn more about Guardian and PlanSource\nBoost_](https://plansource.com/partners/guardian/).\n\nUpdates focused on compliance and information security include:  \n\n  *  **ACA Updates** \u2013 State-level ACA reporting is now supported in PlanSource. For customers that use PlanSource's ACA reporting services and have employees in the affected states, PlanSource will provide services and technology to help employers navigate all the new reporting requirements, including filing and submission of Forms 1094-C and 1095-C, report submission and state filing setup and more. [_Learn more_](https://plansource.com/state-compliance/).\n  *  **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** \u2013 To make it easier for companies to comply with verifiable employee requests under the \"right to know\" clause, employers can now quickly and easily download all an employee's data. And as part of deletion requests under the \"right to be forgotten\" clause, employers can now delete data with one click for employees terminated more than two years ago. \n\nPlanSource launches major software releases four times a year and conducts\nongoing updates and minor enhancements as needed throughout the year. More\ndetails about the Nebula release can be found at [\n_www.plansource.com/nebula_](http://www.plansource.com/nebula).

freezing hiring and delay in joining dates. Let's see how\nthe pandemic is impacting the employment and hiring across the industries.\n\n![Unemployment and hiring trends during\nCOVID-19](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/fl_immutable_cache,w_624,h_351,q_auto,f_auto/v1586096599/1586096598.jpg)\n\nPeople around the world are increasingly worried about how they are going to\npay their bills as coronavirus forces businesses to close and costs millions\nof jobs. United Nations has estimated a job loss of five-25 Mn. Additionally;\nthe International Labor Organization (ILO) stated the world would lose $860 Bn\nto $34 Tr in labor income.\n\n> This is no longer only a global health crisis, it is also a major labor\n> market and economic crisis that is having a huge impact on people. - ILO\n> Director-General, Guy Ryder\n\nThe surge in jobless claims is being fueled by the growing number of\ncompanies, including Marriott, Macy's and GE that have announced layoffs or\nfurloughs as they try to weather the economic storm caused by the pandemic.\n\nHere are some top hiring trends we are observing during the ongoing pandemic:\n\n### Industries experiencing major ramification\n\n  * **Airlines And Airport Operators**\n\nThe aviation sector is already fleecing with IndiGo announcing a salary cut\nfor its employees. Besides that GoAir has already retrenched many of its expat\npilots. If things do not improve we can expect huge job cuts in the aviation\nsector. Many of the airline companies take aircraft on lease and have to pay\nregular money to the leasing companies irrespective of whether they fly or\nkeep these aircraft grounded. All this will put extra pressure on the aviation\ncompanies and they will be forced to sack people. It is also contemplating\nsalary cuts and a voluntary no-pay leave scheme up to certain management\npositions. Given these conditions, airline including global companies like\nSingapore Airlines, United Airlines have suspended all their hiring till at\nleast June.\n\n  * **Travel, Tourism & Hospitality **\n\nA large percentage of total tourism business activity of India, which is\nestimated at $28 billion-plus in forex and upwards of Rs 2 lakh crore in\ndomestic tourism activity, will be at economic risk throughout the year.\n\n> Indian tourism and hospitality industry is staring at a potential job loss\n> of around 3.8 crore, which is around 70 percent of the total workforce, due\n> to the Covid-19 impact.\n\nCOVID-19 effect is such that it can lead to severe to very severe impact on\nthe travel and tourism sector in India with thousands of jobs being axed. \u201cIn\nIndia many hotels both luxury and budget are running at just 10 percent of\noccupancy levels as thousands of people have canceled their trips. This may\nfurther worsen in the times to come at least till end of this year. For\ninstance, Airbnb announced its guests could cancel their reservations for a\nfull refund. This step would have hurt the company very much.\n\nTravel firm MakeMyTrip has announced salary cuts as the tourism sector has\ntaken a massive hit due to the coronavirus outbreak. MakeMyTrip founder Deep\nKalra said that the pay cut will happen across top and managerial levels of\nthe company. Moreover, the salary cut has been done across MakeMyTrip (MMT)\nLimited subsidiaries - Goibibo and redBus. Besides, the company might also lay\noff about 400 employees who are not on its payroll. \"MakeMyTrip has about 650\npeople employed for backend and support services. It has plans to fire 60\npercent of its total headcounts in these departments,\" Entrackr quoted an\nanonymous source.\n\n### Slowdown in hiring\n\nAccording to industry experts, the overall hiring sentiments is likely to\nwitness with 60-65 percent interviews getting delayed especially in service\nsectors. Sectors like BFSI, Retail, and Logistics, where a lot of frontline\nhiring takes place are likely to witness delay.\n\n> C -suite hiring has fallen by 50 percent following the COVID-19 outbreak and\n> this is far worse than what was witnessed during the 2008-09 global\n> financial crisis, said headhunters. The worst affected has been the hiring\n> of expatriates, they said.\n\nAccording to an executive hiring company, \u201cGrowth-related appointments at\ncompanies have come off by up to 50-60 percent. Companies have communicated to\nthem that there is a freeze on leadership hiring for the next six months. So\nmuch so that if an offer has been made but the candidate has not resigned\n(from their present companies), it should be revoked.\u201d\n\n### B-schools internship and final placements on hold\n\nThe summer internship season that would have ideally begun in April has now\neither been deferred to late April or has gone remote/virtual amid the\nCOVID-19 (coronavirus) scare at some of the top B-schools.\n\nFor instance, nine have seen internship cancellation by three companies at\nIndian Institute of Management (IIM) Lucknow. On the other hand, students at\nother B-schools like IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Kozhikode, IIM Indore, FMS Delhi and\nXLRI Xavier Institute of Management have been issued deferred joining dates or\nhave been asked to work remotely. While domestic internships have been\nrelatively less impacted, international internship projects stand canceled\nwith internship periods reduced from typically 7-8 weeks to 5 weeks now,\ndepending on when the lockdown ends.\n\n> However, final placement joining dates, which usually fall in May or June,\n> are yet to see much impact except deferment in some cases. Yet, few LinkedIn\n> posts are doing rounds around consulting companies that have revoked the\n> final placement offers.\n\n### Industries experience surge in hiring and labor shortage\n\nThis swift change in businesses\u2019 daily operations due to ongoing pandemic\ndoesn\u2019t have to mean, \u201cno one is hiring.\u201d In fact, no matter what economy\nwe\u2019re in, one thing is always certain: there are still companies hiring, some\nare even increasing their need for new employees.\n\nOnline groceries like BigBasket, and e-commerce companies like Amazon,\nFlipkart are hiring on-ground staff has been the biggest challenge after\nmigrant workers fled to their native places from various states due to\nlockdown.\n\n> It is reported that e-commerce companies experience about 80-90 percent\n> labor shortage.\n\n### Dependence on technology\n\nVirtual career fairs and events, fully remote recruiting, more personalized\ncareer paths, and greater insights into candidate experiences are quickly\nbecoming the new normal in a post-COVID-19 world. The COVID-19 pandemic is\nquickly changing how every organization is attracting, recruiting, and\nretaining employees on their virtual teams, making remote work the new normal.\n\n### Regulatory framework around deferring joining letters and layoffs\n\n  * **Are advisories with respect to the non-termination of employees binding or not?**\n\nThe said advisories are in the nature of guidelines and are not binding on the\nemployers. However, the MHA order issued on March 29, 2020 has been issued\nunder section 10 (2) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 for payment of wages\non the due date without any deduction, is binding.\n\n  * **Can an employer terminate/retrench its employees?**\n\nThe employers may terminate/retrench their employees in accordance with the\napplicable rules. However, until the nationwide lockdown remains in effect,\nthe Government of India has directed all the employers to pay the wages to\ntheir workers on the due date without any deduction.\n\n  * **What are some of the remedies if an employee is terminated/retrenched?**\n\nFor an employee who falls under the category of a \u2018workman1\u2019, their conditions\nof service are governed by the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947 (\u2018Act\u2019). Section\n2A of the Act provides that dismissal of an individual workman will be deemed\nto be an industrial dispute.\n\nThe dispute can be settled by way of conciliation or by adjudication. In case\nthe matter is settled by way of conciliation, a settlement is arrived between\nthe employer and employee, and dispute comes to an end.\n\nIn case the dispute is not settled, the dispute is referred to adjudication.\nThe process of adjudication is as follows:\n\nThe dispute is referred to as the Grievance Settlement Authority. In case the\ndecision of Grievance Settlement Authority is not acceptable to the employer\nand/or the workmen, the appropriate government, by an order in writing,\nrefers2 the dispute for adjudication to:\n\n  * Board of Conciliation\n  * Court for enquiry\n  * Labour Court (if dispute pertains to matters specified in Second Schedule)\n\nTribunal (if dispute pertains to matters specified in Second or the third\nSchedule)\n\nIn case the employer and the workmen agree to refer the industrial dispute to\narbitration, at any time before the industrial dispute has been referred under\nSection 10 of the Act to a Labour Court or Tribunal or National Tribunal.\n\nFor an employee who is a non-workman, their conditions of service are governed\nby the letter of appointment/ employment contract, issued by the employer and\nthe Indian Contract Act, 1872 and the State-Specific Shops and Establishment\nLegislations as well as the various orders that have been issued by various\ndepartments of central and state governments during the lockdown. A non-\nworkman may approach the civil court and/or the court designated under the\nShops and Establishments legislation seeking payment of any unpaid dues and/or\ndamages for wrongful termination if the termination was against the terms\nagreed by the employer.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics:\n[Recruitment](/category/recruitment/recruitment?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=recruitment\n\"Browse more in: Recruitment\"),\n[#COVID-19](/tag/covid-19?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=covid-19 \"Browse\nmore in: COVID-19\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Anushree Sharma](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1500295266/authors/anushree-\nsharma.jpg)](/author/anushree-sharma)\n\n#### [Anushree Sharma](/author/anushree-sharma)\n\nAnushree is an Assistant Manager- Content at People Matters.

service providers have come under pressure to lift bandwidth caps so\nremote workers don\u2019t get cut off from their employers. Photograph: Joe\nGiddens/PA\n\nCovid-19 could permanently shift working patterns as companies forced to\nembrace remote working by the pandemic find that their employees do not want\nto return to the office once the closures are lifted.\n\nThe sudden increase in working from home is presenting problems as well as\nopportunities: on the one hand, startups such as Slack and Zoom and\nestablished giants including Google and\n[Microsoft](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft) are offering\ntheir tools for free, in the hope that people who start using them in a crisis\nmay carry on once normality returns.\n\nOn the other hand, some systems are already creaking at the edges. Corporate\nnetworks, unused to having a majority of their connections coming in over\nvirtual private networks (VPNs), are experiencing unusual quirks, while\ninternet service providers have come under pressure to lift bandwidth caps so\nthat remote workers do not get cut off from their employers halfway through\nthe month.\n\nBut it looks increasingly as if the situation will not ever go back to how it\nwas: many employees for companies who have sent all staff home are already\nstarting to question why they had to go in to the office in the first place.\n\nLarge technology firms were some of the first to make the switch to remote\nworking for all their staff, building on pre-existing infrastructure such as\noffice chat groups, remote access to critical tools, and the fact that much\nknowledge work can be carried out remotely.\n\nIn Seattle, the hub of many of America\u2019s early Covid-19 cases, companies\nincluding Amazon, LinkedIn, Microsoft and [Google advised workers to stop\ncoming in to the\noffice](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-google-tech-\ndublin-twitter-work-from-home) in late February. In early March, Twitter\n\u201cstrongly advised\u201d all its employees worldwide to do the same, and on\nWednesday, made it compulsory.\n\n\u201cWe understand this is an unprecedented step, but these are unprecedented\ntimes,\u201d Twitter\u2019s head of HR, Jennifer Christie, said in a message to staff.\nChristie promised to reimburse employees, including hourly workers, for the\nexpenses required to set up home offices, covering the costs of buying things\nsuch as computer hardware, desks and ergonomic chairs. \u201cOverall, working from\nhome doesn\u2019t change your day-to-day work, it just means you\u2019ll be doing it\nfrom a different environment,\u201d Christie added.\n\nThose sorts of investments have prompted many to wonder if companies that\nembrace remote working in a crisis may find it sticks around as normality\nreturns. It is harder to say no to employee requests for working from home if\nHR has already bought them a new desk \u2013 and it is easier to view the\ninvestment as a sensible one if it pays off for years, rather than months, to\ncome.\n\n\u201cThis is not how I envisioned the distributed work revolution taking hold,\u201d\n[said ](https://ma.tt/2020/03/coronavirus-remote-work/)[Matt\nMullenweg](https://ma.tt/2020/03/coronavirus-remote-work/), chief executive of\nWordPress and Tumblr owner Automattic. Mullenweg\u2019s company is already\n\u201cdistributed\u201d, and he predicts the changes \u201cmight also offer an opportunity\nfor many companies to finally build a culture that allows long-overdue work\nflexibility.\n\n\u201cMillions of people will get the chance to experience days without long\ncommutes, or the harsh inflexibility of not being able to stay close to home\nwhen a family member is sick\u2026 This might be a chance for a great reset in\nterms of how we work,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly what the industry behind remote work is hoping. \u201cWe are fully\nprepared for this situation,\u201d said a spokesperson for Slack, which makes\npopular business chat software. \u201cFirst and foremost, our concern is for the\nfamilies and individuals affected by the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cFor now, we are focused on helping people around the world adapt to remote\nwork with [free resources](http://www.slack.com/solutions/remote-work). For\nexample, we have been hosting free consultations for companies adapting to\nremote work for the first time. We\u2019ve been speaking to companies of all sizes\nand from all industries \u2013 from large enterprises with hundreds of thousands of\nemployees, to small businesses with a team of five.\u201d\n\nSlack isn\u2019t alone. Microsoft has made its cloud \u201cproductivity suite\u201d free to\nsmall businesses for the next six months, including its Slack competitor,\nTeams. [Google](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google) followed suit\nwith its own business subscription, while videoconferencing service Zoom has\nlifted limitations on its own free tier, allowing conversations to exceed 40\nminutes.\n\n## The art of Skype set-dressing: how to video-call the office when in\nquarantine | Imogen West-Knights\n\nRead more\n\n[](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/11/quarantine-video-\ncall-coronavirus-colleagues-home-work)\n\nBut for every company smoothly moving to the future of remote working, others\nhave hit problems. Some have been comparatively minor: Facebook employees\nfound their corporate network was banned from the takeaway service DoorDash\nfor suspicious behaviour, as the company\u2019s entire workforce began placing\norders for delivery all over the Bay Area in California while logged in to a\nVPN connecting from the same IP address.\n\nOthers have been more serious. An early fear that home broadband networks\nwould collapse under the weight of usage was quelled by UK service providers,\nwhose trade body, ISPA, pointed out that evening peak activity, when the\nnation sits down to stream Netflix and play online video games, is often 10\ntimes the typical daytime demand.\n\nMore pressing is the fact that internet usage in general is increasing across\nthe board. Cloudflare, which provides online infrastructure that underpins a\nhuge swathe of the internet, says it has been tracking the increase. [Its\nchief executive, ](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-during-the-\ncoronavirus-emergency/)[Matthew\nPrince](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-during-the-coronavirus-\nemergency/)[, says](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-during-the-\ncoronavirus-emergency/) that \u201cas more people work from home, peak traffic in\nimpacted regions has increased, on average, approximately 10%. In Italy, which\nhas imposed a nationwide quarantine, peak internet traffic is up 30%. Traffic\npatterns have also shifted so peak traffic is occurring earlier in the day in\nimpacted regions.\u201d\n\nThe real problems start when schools get suspended. Usage of Italy\u2019s national\nnetwork has surged by more than two-thirds, not due to working from home, but\ndue to housebound schoolchildren logging on to games such as Fortnite,\naccording to a report [from Bloomberg\nNews](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-during-the-coronavirus-\nemergency/).\n\nSpikes in usage are most likely to affect people who pay for their internet\nwith bandwidth caps, particularly common in the US and among those who rely on\nmobile broadband. Some American ISPs, including AT&T, have [started suspending\nthe practice](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v74qzb/atandt-suspends-\nbroadband-usage-caps-during-coronavirus-crisis) in order to avoid being blamed\nfor preventing work, but not everyone has done so.\n\nStill, technology can only go so far, and working from home is not for\neveryone. \u201cI\u2019ve worked 100% remote before,\u201d said one tech industry worker who\nhas been sent home, \u201cand there comes a point where even an introvert would\nlike to see another human.\u201d\n\n## **Tools for remote working**\n\n**Slack**\n\n[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/), the \u00fcber workplace management tool, is\nloved and loathed in equal measure, but one thing it has going for it is its\nfree-to-play business model: rather than needing to sign up the entire\norganisation at once, it is easy for individual teams, desks and offices to\nget started with the free tier, and expand as they see fit. That means it is\nbest placed to help home workers quickly recreate the sort of in-person chat\nthey had in the office.\n\n**Trello**\n\nWhere Slack recreates the feeling of turning to a colleague for a quick chat\nthat\u2019s as much personal as professional, [Trello](https://trello.com/) is more\nlike your boss walking over to \u201cjust check on how you\u2019re doing\u201d. The project\nmanagement software lets teams arrange and assign tasks, track wider project\nprogress, and build workflows for repeated jobs \u2013 perfect for day four or five\nof working from home, when you might start to wonder if your boss has\nforgotten you exist.\n\n**Zoom**\n\nVideoconferencing tools are 10 a penny, but [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) has\nimpressed many by ironing out the kinks in an often-frustrating process. The\napp lifted its limit on free accounts as a response to the crisis, and\ntheoretically supports up to 1,000 participants in a single meeting, though\nit\u2019s unclear whether that\u2019s actually a positive. The company has had some\ncontroversies, however, from an [insecure plugin for Mac\nclients](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/a3xpma/how-to-remove-zoom-from-\nyour-mac) that was fixed in June to a questionable \u201cattention tracking\u201d\nfeature that allows horrible bosses to use AI to check whether their employees\nare actually looking at the screen.\n\n**Tomates**\n\nJust as important as making sure you work well at home is making sure you take\nbreaks from work at home. The Pomodoro method, a well-known approach to focus\nmanagement that lets you break the day into 20-minute chunks with five-minute\nrests, is one such approach.\n[Tomates](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tomates-time-\nmanagement/id1062002496?mt=8&at=11l7ja&ct=tss), a simple and cheap Mac app,\nhelps you to automate those timers \u2013 although any similar app will work too,\nor a simple physical timer like the tomato alarms the method is named after.\n\nTopics\n\n  * [ Technology ](https://www.theguardian.com/uk/technology)\n\n  * [ Coronavirus

While most countries have urged their citizens to not travel unless\nurgent, practice social distancing, and work from home - how organizations are\npreparing to keep their employees safe while ensuring business is going as\nusual, is something worth commending.\n\nOrganizations from across the globe are responding to the unprecedented\nchallenges that COVID-19 has created in multiple ways by trying to ensure\nbusiness continuity while controlling costs and managing people. Managing\nemployee experience during these tough times is also becoming a critical\naspect of how organizations are navigating through this crisis.\n\nRohit Thakur, CHRO, Paytm talks to us about the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, how\nthey dealt with the case of an employee that tested positive for COVID-19, how\nthey are monitoring the situation and what steps they are taking to keep the\nimpact to the minimum while ensuring their employees feel safe and secure.\n\n### Paytm was one of the first organizations to have a COVID-19 positive\nemployee. How did you deal with the situation? What support did you offer to\nthe employee? How did you ensure there was no panic in the workplace due to\nthis?\n\nWe have to understand that the spread of Coronavirus is a global crisis. It\nhas affected millions across the globe and a colleague of ours is,\nunfortunately, one of them. We took stringent measures and decided to shut our\noffices. Our first step was to communicate the decision clearly and directly\nto the employees.\n\n> Our organization was factual, authentic and transparent in our\n> communication, so when we announced the work-from-home model, our teams\n> appreciated the decision and jumped all in to make it successful.\"\n\nOur organization was factual, authentic and transparent in our communication,\nso when we announced the work-from-home model, our teams appreciated the\ndecision and jumped all in to make it successful. Questions and queries were\nanswered by leaders and teams locally and centrally. All offices across the\ncountry have been sanitized, sterilized and fumigated as well. We were in\nconstant touch with the family of the Corona affected employee to check on his\nhealth condition and offered full support to the family throughout the period\nhe was hospitalized. We are glad that the employee has recovered & is\ndischarged from the hospital now.\n\n### On a scale of 1-5 (5 being extreme, production getting halted and\nbusinesses facing losses), how do you perceive the current business situation\nin the wake of the COVID-19 crisis?\n\nA global crisis of this level cannot be quantified. The company has switched\nto the work-from-home model and we are adapting to new ways of working using\ntechnology and collaboration tools. In fact, our colleagues are working harder\nas everyone understands the gravity of the situation.\n\n### What steps are you taking in dealing with this crisis situation?\n\nNeedless to say that all business travel has been canceled. We have made it\nmandatory to work from home for all our employees and are also frequently\nsharing WFH tips with them in order to promote efficient virtual collaboration\nand working.\n\nWith regards to health precautions, we are also constantly in touch with our\npanel of doctors and reaching out to them for expert guidance and any queries\nwhich our employees might have.\n\n> Our business continuity plan is activated and all employees are enabled to\n> work from home remotely while ensuring there is no impact on our business.\"\n\nWe are encouraging employees to maximize the use of technology with tools like\nDing Talk, Google Hangouts, Video Conference, etc. to collaborate virtually\nfor meetings. Also, our business continuity plan is activated and all\nemployees are enabled to work from home remotely while ensuring there is no\nimpact on our business.\n\n### What policies and processes do you have in place for an infected employee\nor an employee whose family member(s) have been infected?\n\nIt goes without saying that every colleague of ours is important to us. We\nprovide them with all possible assistance and ensure that they are well taken\ncare of. Our comprehensive health benefits plan covers all eventualities for\nthem and immediate family members.\n\n### Who is handling crisis management in your organization? Do you have a\nseparate COVID-19 response team? What is the role of the team?\n\nAn Emergency Response Team (ERT) consisting of senior leaders from various\ndepartments of the organization is monitoring the situation closely so that we\ncan share real-time advisory & appropriate precautions with our employees.\n\n### Do you think the outbreak of COVID-19 and the crisis is impacting this\nappraisal cycle?\n\nWe are a performance-driven organization and our appraisal process focuses on\nrecognizing and rewarding people based on their performance. We are currently\nin the process of kickstarting our appraisal process as per our yearly\ntimelines.\n\n### How can employees better prepare for this situation?\n\nAt this stage, we are urging our employees to take care of their health &\nsafety as that is our topmost priority. Following our government's advice,\nstaying at home and social distancing is key.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [C-Suite](/category/leadership-\nstrategy/c-suite?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=c-suite \"Browse more in:\nC-Suite\"),\n[#COVID-19](/tag/covid-19?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=covid-19 \"Browse\nmore in: COVID-19\"),\n[#CXtoEX](/tag/cxtoex?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=cxtoex \"Browse more\nin: CXtoEX\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Yasmin Taj](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1532607622/authors/yasmin-\ntaj.jpg)](/author/yasmin-taj)\n\n#### [Yasmin Taj](/author/yasmin-taj)\n\nYasmin Taj is working with People Matters as Senior Editor.

should help a business streamline its processes and manage their supply\nchains more efficiently. But more data is being generated than ever before,\nand with artificial intelligence and mobile data changing the way businesses\ninteract with their ERP there is a real danger of data paralysis. _Michelle\nMooney_ examines how the next wave of ERP is changing the supply chain. **\n\nBig data has the ability to completely change the face of ERP, however,\nbusinesses could suffer from \u201ctoo much\u201d data, and not enough intelligence.\n\nThose that place too much emphasis on numbers and KPIs can often lose sight of\nits true value, says Alistair Laycock, custom solutions director at Haulmont\nTechnologies: \u201cStaff with little real-world experience can identify benefits\nthat are logical according to the numbers on a spreadsheet but impractical or\nimpossible in the real world.\n\n\u201cIt is vital to filter the insight from data through the prism of operations\nstaff with years of experience \u2013 conclusions must be validated in terms of\nobjectives and outcomes, sense-checked against experience and common sense.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an outlook that Simon Carpenter, head of UK centres of expertise at SAP,\nconcurs with: \u201cAs the world digitises and business models change, ERP systems\nwill have to contend with more data, much higher process velocities and the\nneed to support business agility. At the same time, they remain fundamental to\nan organisation\u2019s ability to deliver the type of experiences its customers\nexpect. To do all this, ERP systems will both consume and generate Big Data.\u201d\n\nIn the continuously changing world of data \u2013 where it grows non-stop \u2013 ERP\nsystems need to be able to handle the new demands. Simon Geale, senior vice-\npresident, client solutions at Proxima, notes that \u201cadvances in computer power\nor interconnectivity of devices\u201d are what is driving Big Data, and that the\n\u201cnet outcome is that nearly everything asks for, collects or produces data in\nsome form.\u201d\n\n**New data, new demands**\n\n![](https://www.logisticsmanager.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/11/Data-300x225.jpg)Therefore, says Geale, the challenge\nfor the organisation is to structure the data, analyse, interpret and uncover\nwhat is actually useful to their business.\n\n\u201cIf the data doesn\u2019t give you any ability to act or make decisions, then it\u2019s\njust data,\u201d he says. \u201cIf data presents a story to you or paints a picture,\nthen you have information. If that information tells you something that you\ndidn\u2019t know then you have insight.\u201d\n\nIt is about processing that data in an intelligent way, so that it isn\u2019t just\ndata, and actually provides a business insight. Geale says: \u201cThere is a real\ndanger of data paralysis, i.e. collecting vast amounts of data but not\ninvesting in the new types of tools or capabilities required to optimise its\nuse.\u201d\n\nDominic Regan, senior director for value chain execution at Oracle, says:\n\u201cTraditionally, the ERP system was seen as a back-office tool that only saw\nthe limelight when something went wrong \u2013 but that is all changing. Now, it is\nseen as the engine room of an organisation. Businesses are recognising the\ntrue value of their ERP system, which can act as a funnel for big data,\ninspire out-of-the-box thinking and deliver results across the organisation.\n\n\u201cFor supply chain management, an effective ERP system can be a lifeline,\u201d\nRegan adds. \u201cConnecting the data within supply chain management (SCM) and ERP\nsystems shouldn\u2019t be a burden. It can actually bring an end to stretched\ndelivery times, delayed orders, and misplaced shipments \u2013 all of which are\ncaused by a lack of visibility and performance analytics.\n\n\u201cNot only can this clever use of connected data relieve many of the everyday\nstresses of supply chain management, but by supporting both business growth\nand operational excellence, integrated ERP and SCM can also help businesses\nincrease loyalty, profitability and service levels,\u201d he says.\n\nTypically, says Jon Roberts, senior sales manager at OrderWise, ERP customers\nwant to increase efficiencies, have better control over their performance,\nstock and inventory, reduce costs, increase profits and determine whether\ntheir supply can keep up with demand.\n\nChoosing the right ERP system in the first instance is critical, says Roberts,\nas it can pose the biggest challenge before a business has even got started.\n\u201cWhen a person is tasked with finding an ERP solution for their company, their\nnatural instinct is to choose a solution that they\u2019ve either heard of before\nor they know is used by a reputable brand,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cHowever, this can sometimes leave them with expensive software that isn\u2019t\nentirely suited to the needs of their business. What\u2019s worse, businesses often\nmake do with their solution and work around it to get the information they\nneed, rather than have the ERP solution work for them, creating a difficult\npredicament.\u201d\n\n**The AI treasure trove**\n\n![](https://www.logisticsmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/artificial-\nintelligence-2228610_1280-300x188.jpg)It is now artificial intelligence (AI)\nthat is challenging the notion that businesses could suffer from \u201ctoo much\u201d\ndata, and not enough intelligence \u2013 and 2020 might just be the year that AI\nchanges the supply chain.\n\nSAP\u2019s Carpenter explains: \u201cVarious flavours of AI \u2013 especially machine-\nlearning (but also natural language processing and deep learning) have been\ntechnically feasible and increasingly economically viable for a few years.\nEarly adopters are already reaping the benefits \u2013 not least of which is the\nlearning curve effect. The conditions are right for 2020 to be the tipping\npoint for adoption at scale \u2013 ERP systems already contain a treasure trove of\nunexploited data.\u201d\n\nProxima\u2019s Geale adds: \u201cIt would be a disservice to many to suggest that AI is\nnot already driving vast change across supply chain and ERP. __ If you think\nabout AI itself, it is normally used to sit over defined processes or\ncalculations or solve specific problems that it has been taught. It can work\nfar quicker than a human and, provided the parameters are right, with lower\nfailure rates. In simple terms, where robotics tend to carry out the process,\nAI takes the decisions and, or does the calculations and interactions. This\ntranslates well to supply chain and ERP in particular, but first an\norganisation either needs to identify or define where it can be used and help\nit to learn.\u201d\n\nGeale explains how AI has played an important role in the commerce and retail\nsectors in particular: \u201cSome, if the most prominent examples of AI in the\nsupply chain are in the comms and high tech industries as well as retail\nsupply chain where early adopters have had to invest heavily in software and\ncapabilities to reap the benefits as they are in most cases leading the\nmarket.\u201d\n\nSome of the benefits of AI and machine learning include productivity and\nefficiency wins, as Carpenter explains how SAP\u2019s customers can benefit from\nits systems: \u201cAt SAP, customers already using machine-learning based\napplications are reporting substantial gains in productivity and efficiency\ndue to higher automation levels. For example, one company reported\ninvoice/payment automatic matching rates improving from 70% to over 90% while\nanother enjoyed automation rate improvement from 90% to 97% using machine\nlearning with SAP.\n\nAnother area where AI is making a difference is in how users interact with\ntheir ERP systems using Natural Language Processing (NLP) based \u2018bots. SAP\nusers can now talk to their SAP Digital Core system in natural language using\na digital assistant called SAP CoPilot \u2013 making for what SAP describe as \u201ca\nmore enjoyable work experience and improved productivity\u201d.\n\nRichard Jones, chief technology officer at Linkfresh, which provides ERP\nsystems to the food sector, says: \u201cThe real challenge is understanding how an\nAI model made a decision. This is particularly important in the food sector\nwhere the supply of an incorrect product could result in a food scare or worse\nstill, a fatality. Simply saying it was AI that made a decision, isn\u2019t\nacceptable. AI has to be understandable and repeatable. This is the whole\nsector known as predictive AI which is where I believe It will play an\nimportant role in this decade.\u201d\n\n**Two-tier** **too many**\n\n![](https://www.logisticsmanager.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/customercare-300x200.jpg)Some businesses run a two-\ntier ERP, by using a tier-one model for normal processes, as well as financial\naspects, and a two-tier model for managing smaller, more specific aspects of\nthe business to address individual needs. Geale explains that a two-tier\nsystem can be a good fit for certain companies.\n\nHe says: \u201cTwo tier ERP is not uncommon and can be a good choice of strategy\nfor some firms. Two tier \u201cby design\u201d may enable a firm to have a core platform\nand plug in more niche and agile solutions which better suit the specific\nneeds of different parts of a business.\u201d\n\nGeale adds that it is important not to lose sight of the core functionality of\nan ERP as it is a business platform, so if one system cannot suit all business\nunits and actually causes inefficiencies, then two tier might be a good\noption.\n\n\u201cThis is why businesses need to think carefully about what ERP model will work\nbest for them, to increase productivity, and avoid losses,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\nare other instances where organisations run multiple systems but not \u2018by\ndesign\u2019. A good example of this might be post acquisition (something that is\noften true for large international corporates). In this case, the multiple ERP\narchitecture will, on paper, offer opportunities to simplify processes, pool\ndata or consolidate people, however making the change can have enormous\norganisational, cost and change implications.\u201d\n\nJones at LinkFresh adds that modern ERP systems are easier to modify: \u201cWe come\nacross a lot of ERP\u2019s where people have bolted on other solutions. Modern ERPs\nare increasingly easier to expand and modularise. An AppStore type model where\nelements of an ERP can be easily extended, i.e. adding a payroll or warehouse\nmodule. Having an App Eco-System around ERP will level the playing field while\nacting as a standard way to discover the best in breed solutions to take and\nERP into the desired direction of an organisation.\u201d\n\n**Mobile** **and competitive**\n\n![](https://www.logisticsmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/RR-google-\nrobot-ships-300x181.jpg)Aside from AI, can mobile ERP be a gamechanger too?\nRoberts at OrderWise says it can make a company stand out among the crowd.\n\u201cMobile ERP is certainly realistic to keep your business ahead of the game.\nWhat if you were at a trade show, met a potential lead and didn\u2019t have your\nexceptional business performance at your fingertips? Not having this\ninformation readily available could lead to missed opportunities and push them\nstraight to competitors. Take OrderWise for example - businesses are able to\nraise orders, amend customer details, integrate with Google Maps for client\nvisits, scan barcodes using their mobile camera and stay connected with their\nbusiness intelligence while out and about. This gives a business\nrepresentative everything they need to save the day, no matter where they\nare.\u201d\n\nJones says that mobile ERP has been with us for some time and LinkFresh has\n75% of its workforce using elements of its ERP on mobile devices: \u201cHowever,\nattempting to implement an entire ERP system on mobile may not be possible\njust yet: \u201cThat the goal is to surface not the whole ERP mobile. Making a\nwhole ERP available on a phone or tablet device is a big ask and I would\nargue, a less great experience than using a laptop or desktop machine. However\nproviding warehouse operations, timesheets, phone lists, HR, and leave\n[planning], mobile makes lots of sense and can be a vital element of a modern\nemployees interaction with an ERP.\u201d\n\nProxima\u2019s Geale agrees that an ERP system on a mobile device can greatly\nimpact the efficiency of a business and believes that mobile ERP is more than\nrealistic in 2020 as \u201cit can make an enormous difference to a business\u2019s\nperformance\u201d.\n\n\u201cAn easy way to think about the benefits of mobile ERP is to consider the\ndifference that mobile telephony has made over the last decade. Consider all\nthe things that a smartphone now enables the user to do at home, at work or on\nthe move. The infrastructure has enabled all kinds of hardware and\napplications to be developed with mobility in mind that have made us smarter,\nfaster and put all kinds of information and connectivity at our fingertips.\u201d\n\nHowever, implementing an ERP on a mobile device could come with setbacks, and\na fully expansive system may not be possible just yet. Geale adds: \u201cAs with\ntelephony there are a lot of players involved in taking the full end to end\nERP experience mobile and optimising it with the other connecting applications\nand infrastructure that we use day in day out. Like most things digital at the\nmoment there are also lots of false promises, lots of vendors offer \u201cmobility\nor cloud ERP\u201d but in reality they are just vendor hosted solutions and do not\noffer a full suite of solutions and applications designed with mobility in\nmind.\n\n\u201cMobile ERP won\u2019t happen overnight, but it is realistic to plan it out and\nstart taking the first steps.\u201d So perhaps 2020 will not be the year of mobile\nERP systems, but as data and intelligent systems continue to grow, ERP systems\non mobile devices are a very near future possibility.\n\nHaulmont\u2019s Laycock explains how cloud computing has changed the face of ERP\nsystems, and how their utilisation will impact businesses in the future. He\nnotes that: \u201cCloud infrastructure has removed a massive barrier to entry for\nbusinesses considering ERP modernisation by removing huge upfront\ninfrastructure costs and the challenge of building or hiring expertise to\nmanage it. The cloud also helps to de-risk and streamline the installation of\nupdates and deployment of new functionality.\n\n\u201cFinally, it also makes custom-built ERP systems affordable for SMEs and the\nmid-market, driving innovation by enabling smaller, more diverse suppliers to\nbring new technology to the customer for a monthly fee rather than being\nrestricted to only choosing from a handful of well established, but inflexible\nlarge providers,\u201d he adds.\n\n**This article originally appeared in[Logistics Manager

](mailto:enquiries@relocatemagazine.co.uk)\n\nTechnology is helping Global Mobility and HR pros keep up and comply with\never-evolving legislative and talent shifts. Ashley Daly and Mike Gatto of\nINEO joined Relocate Global\u2019s Fiona Murchie in an webinar to walk-through the\nneed-to-knows.\n\n## Watch the recap of the Relocate and Ineo Think Global Mobility Technology\nWebinar\n\n* * *\n\nA recent study showed 61% of global mobility teams are planning to harness the\n[benefits of technology](https://www.santaferelo.com/en/mobility-\ninsights/global-mobility-survey/) in the next 24 months. Data also suggests\n60% of CEOs plan to [double the level of current automation](/news/dsapsted-\ntechnology-chief-executives-behind-new-automation-drive-1119) to at least a\ntenth of all operational processes by 2025 \u2013 a significant increase from the\ncurrent 7%. These figures suggest huge scope for tech-enabled efficiencies in\nthe global mobility arena and an imminent shift in approach.\n\n## Leveraging value from tech\n\nAmong the more easily quantifiable benefits of tech-enabled solutions are that\nthey create seamless, compliant reporting that can be easily shared, so\ncreating efficiencies and synergies in the process. Investing in technology\nsolutions has other advantages when the interlinked agendas of [employee\nsupport ](/partner-family-support) and a strategic focus are factored into\ntechnology and organisational culture.\u201cTechnology investment can be a hard\nsell, but critical is a focus on the invaluable benefits to be gained,\u201d says\nAshley Daly, director of global compensation technology solutions at\n[INEO](https://www.ineomobility.com), a global mobility software, financial\nsolutions and tax services provider.\u201cLeveraging technology not only\nfacilitates global tax reporting compliance, but also introduces process\nautomation, enabling global mobility professionals to better focus on the\nparamount task of helping their businesses execute their corporate strategy.\"\n\n## Net-to-net calculations and compliance\n\nDemonstrating how INEO\u2019s customisable Technology Suite supports the\ninternational offer process and associated tax compliance with shadow tax\nreporting and modelling of tax-equalised home-based salaries, Mike Gatto,\nINEO\u2019s global mobility manager and Ashley Daly will introduce in the Think\nGlobal Mobility Technology webinar on 24 March the latest solution in its\ndigital compensation suite: INEO\u2019s Net-to-Net Calculator.\u201cEmployers are\nlooking to adequately compensate relocating employees as the business adapts\nquickly to global needs,\u201d says Mike Gatto.\u201cTechnology can provide tools to\naccomplish this task effectively and efficiently. The Net-to-Net calculator is\njust one of those tools which reports to both the employer and the employee in\nan easily understandable format the full value of the prospective compensation\npackage. This makes it easier for employers to adapt to individual\ncircumstances and in a compliant manner..\u201d\n\n## Talking tech \u2013 Think Global Mobility Technology webinar\n\n\u201cThis webinar will demystify some of the complex concepts and jargon\nassociated with [global mobility compensation](/news/hr-international-\nassignments-new-survey-reveals-home-truths-about-expat-cost-of-living-\nrholmes-0320) and [tax compliance](/news/international-assignments-kpmg-warns-\nof-short-term-assignment-compliance-risk-rholmes-0120), and take the\nparticipant through case studies to bring strategies for addressing to life,\u201d\nsays Ashley Daly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. \u201cOf course, you can\u2019t\njust introduce the technology. You have to have the right infrastructure\naround it to make it work. We look forward to having these conversations and\nexploring all these issues in the webinar with Relocate Global on 24 March,\n2-3pm GMT.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n **[Subscribe to Relocate\nExtra](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/magazineregistration?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=reg),\nour monthly newsletter, to get all the latest international assignments and\nglobal mobility news.** **Relocate\u2019s new[Global Mobility\nToolkit](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/global-mobility-toolkit-download-\nour-preview-factsheet?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=gmtt)\nprovides free information, practical advice and support for HR, global\nmobility managers and global teams operating overseas.** **[![Global Mobility\nToolkit download factsheets resource centre](/media/images/RELO-GM-\nTOOLKIT-432x172-v2_12993_t5.jpg)](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/global-\nmobility-toolkit-download-our-preview-\nfactsheet?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=gmtbutton)**\n**[Access](https://www.relocatemagazine.com/directory?utm_source=website&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=dir)\nhundreds of global services and suppliers in our Online Directory** **[![Click\nto get to the Relocate Global Online\nDirectory](/media/images/ScreenShot2016-09-20at171042_9694_t5.png)](/directory)**\n\n\u00a92020 Re:locate magazine, published by Profile Locations, Spray Hill, Hastings\nRoad, Lamberhurst, Kent TN3 8JB.

It\ninvolves research to discover who your customers are, what they need, and\nwhere their pain points lie.\n\nCEM means making changes to the way you do things. And it means continually\nlistening to your customers to find out how well you\u2019re doing and what you can\ndo to keep improving.\n\nThere are a few core principles to understand when you\u2019re getting started with\ncustomer experience. The first is that customer service and customer\nexperience are different things.\n\n  * **Customer experience** includes every interaction your customer has with your brand, including those that happen outside of your channels.\n  * **Customer service** is a subset of customer experience. It\u2019s the way you treat customers when they are in direct contact with you, via text, phone, chat or other forms of communication.\n\nThe next is that customer experience is all about journeys. A customer\u2019s\nexperience isn\u2019t bound by internal divisions like sales vs. service or retail\nvs. trade. It is a sum of many parts, and in most cases you can\u2019t predict\nwhere the customer\u2019s journey will begin or where it will lead.  \n  \nAlong that [customer journey](/customer-journey-mapping), any one point of\nfailure (glitchy website, over-long wait for a chat response) can detract\nhugely from the customer\u2019s experience as a whole. It doesn\u2019t matter if the\ncustomer\u2019s delighted by one part of your business if they\u2019re later\ndisappointed by something else.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s wise to optimize every part of the customer journey and create\nan integrated, consistent omnichannel experience that\u2019s based around your\ncustomer rather than the internal anatomy of your business.\n\nResearch from McKinsey found that [customer satisfaction is 73% more\nlikely](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-\ninsights/the-ceo-guide-to-customer-experience) when entire journeys work well\nthan when individual touchpoints do.\n\n## How to measure, optimize, and scale your customer experience capability\n\nCustomer experience management begins with understanding your customers and\ntheir needs. Your [CRM system](https://www.g2.com/categories/crm) is a\nvaluable tool here as it already contains a record of your interactions with\neach customer to date.\n\nYou can also bring in tools like customer surveys and UX research which can\nhelp you dig deeper and understand your customers\u2019 priorities. Do your target\ncustomers care more about certain things than others? Which of the typical\ncustomer journeys for your business hold the most personal importance for\ncustomers? Where are they most likely to want support, reassurance, or a\ngreater range of options?\n\nCustomer-based research, and the resulting customer experience insights, will\nhelp you to prioritize your CX improvements and work more intuitively on\nexisting projects. It could also help point toward efficiencies and\nimprovements you can make for your company\u2019s own sake, especially where\ncustomer insights provide a birds-eye view across your internal silos.  \n  \nIt\u2019s likely that CX improvements will start small within a company and then\ngrow. Small, successful pilot projects will help generate interest in CX and\nmake the case for wider-scale changes and more ambitious programs.\n\n### A company-wide approach\n\nAs we\u2019ve suggested, there are major rewards to be reaped when companies think\nbig. Make your whole business experience-led and the benefits are likely to\nmultiply accordingly. As an experience-first business, you\u2019re in line for\npositive results on big picture measures like your brand loyalty, plus\nimmediate-return results in terms of sales.\n\n**According to**[US research from PwC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/press-\nreleases/2018/experience-is-everything-heres-how-to-get-it-right.html) **:**\n\n  * Consumers will pay up to 16% more for products and services if the experience is great\n  * 1 in 3 will leave a brand they love after just one bad experience\n  * Customers say they\u2019re more likely to try additional services or products when brands provide superior customer experience\n\nMeanwhile, according to [Adobe\u2019s Digital Trends\n2020](https://www.adobe.com/uk/offer/digital-trends-2020.html#): \u201c36% of\ncompanies on the forefront of customer experience said they exceeded their top\nbusiness goal by a significant margin, compared with only 12% of mainstream\ncompanies,\u201d\n\nWhat does that look like in practice? It means that experience isn\u2019t just the\nduty of a single team or department. While it\u2019s important to appoint and\nsupport experience management leaders in your business, they should be setting\ngoals and providing strategies for an entire company\u2019s behavior, not working\nin isolation.\n\n### Changing culture\n\nMaking a commitment to customer-centric ways of doing business is likely to\ninvolve cultural change within your organization. This is likely to be a\nmedium- to long-term endeavor, but there are some changes you can make\nstraight away that will promote CX-friendly ways of working.\n\n### Lead by example\n\nC-suite and leadership have an important role to play in making CX a company\npriority, not only because they\u2019re empowered to make change but because staff\nat all levels naturally look to them to see how to behave. Leaders who walk\nthe talk and put customer experience first can help turn the tide towards\ncustomer-first thinking.\n\n### **Bake CX into your goals and KPIs**\n\nAt team and individual levels you can promote customer-first thinking by\nexplicitly making it a priority in performance management and target-setting.\nNote however that you should prioritize outcomes such as \u201cmake the customer\nfeel heard\u201d rather than behaviors like \u201cchat to every customer\u201d \u2013 authentic\ncustomer connections are more likely to flourish if staff are given some\npersonal input into how they\u2019re achieved.\n\n### **Appoint CX champions**\n\nIt can be helpful to think of CX as a horizontal function, a little like HR or\nIT, vitally connected with every department. Unlike HR or IT though, it can be\nimproved by anyone who is willing and able to step into a customer\u2019s shoes.\nWithin each area of business, try appointing an enthusiastic CX champion who\ncan make suggestions and provide support in making their own part of the\ncompany more customer-centric.\n\n## Setting up a customer experience management system\n\nYour customer management system is a set of tools and processes you can use\ncompany wide to create a continuous cycle of improvement. It\u2019s likely to\ninclude elements you\u2019re already using, with a few new ideas and approaches\nadded to the mix. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to getting it up and running.\n\n### Goals\n\nThe first step is to decide what success will look like. Think about what you\nwant CX to do for your business and what positive results you want to see.\n\n### Strategy\n\nBased on what you\u2019ve discovered about your current levels of customer loyalty\nand customer satisfaction, identify first priorities. Choose one or more\ncustomer journeys to act as your pilot program.\n\n### Tools\n\nCX improvement is largely a matter of awareness and agility, and this is what\nyour tools need to provide. You need to be able to collect customer feedback\ndata at a number of touchpoints across your customer journey(s) and analyze it\nin a way that allows you to take meaningful, rapid action. You also need to be\nable to circulate those insights within your business in a clear, digestible\nformat.\n\n### Process\n\nChoose where in the customer journey you will collect feedback from your end-\nusers and how you will use it. It\u2019s a given that feedback data should be\nanalyzed to reveal your current performance levels, but you may also want to\nfeed it into parts of your business that can make immediate improvements to\nindividual cases. For example, feedback from a dissatisfied customer could be\nrouted directly to the person responsible for the relevant touchpoint.\n\nWhile having a structured customer experience management model is important,\nit\u2019s worth noting that CX is an exploratory process and you will also need to\nallow room for flexibility. You should expect your program to change and grow\nalong with your business and what you learn over time.\n\n### Measure, check and iterate\n\nWhile setting up a CX program, and throughout its duration, measurement is\ncritical. Early in your planning phase, define the metrics that indicate\nsuccess and that you\u2019ll continually measure and track.\n\n**CSat**  and [NPS](/net-promoter-score) are likely candidates for many\nbusinesses, along with [CES](https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-\nmanagement/customer/customer-effort-score/) (Customer Effort Score). You may\nalso want to pull in quantitative measures linked to CX, such as waiting times\non phone and chat channels, customer review scores, and website loading\nspeeds.  \n  \nEven more important than defining your metrics is being able to monitor them\non a continual basis. While it\u2019s true that using multiple metrics will help\nyou get a clearer and more multifaceted picture of how you\u2019re doing, make sure\nyour analytical capacity and your collection capacity are in line with one\nanother. Collecting data is only valuable if you\u2019re able to turn it into\nimprovements and predictions.\n\n### Software that supports your goals\n\nIn order to be useful, cost-effective and scalable, a CX program typically\nrelies on software to store data, route information to the right people and\nanalyze results. Here\u2019s what to look for in CX management software.\n\n#### Accessible everywhere\n\nCloud-based is becoming the gold standard in enterprise software, and with\ngood reason. A cloud-based platform means projects are easy to scale up to\nlarge numbers of users, and that they can access data and analyses on a range\nof devices according to need.\n\n#### User-friendly\n\nBecause CX is a cross-departmental discipline, it\u2019s important that your\nsoftware is as accessible as possible. It should be able to provide on-demand\ndata and insights in a format that anyone can understand.\n\n#### Analytically powerful\n\nIdeally, CX software should be able to not only collect data and analyze it,\nbut use statistical tools to extrapolate and make predictions about the\ndrivers behind positive CX outcomes. It\u2019s a plus if your software can perform\nanalysis on natural language, such as the contents of online reviews and free-\ntext fields in surveys.\n\n#### Integrated\n\nCX touches almost every part of your business, so it\u2019s important to be able to\nconnect your CX software with the platforms you already use, such as CRM and\nHR systems, marketing software, social media analytics, SEO and marketing\ntools.\n\n## Building your dream team\n\nCX is a company wide mission, and your CX team is the beating heart of the\noperation. But how do you bring that team together? To decide who you should\nhire or nurture, you need to know what makes a great CX professional.  \n  \nGiven that CX is a relatively new concept, it\u2019s unsurprising that most CX\nprofessionals have arrived from careers in other areas. HR is a common\nbackground, as is customer service. CX leaders may also cross over from user\nexperience and service design, psychology, marketing or sales.  \n  \nWherever they come from, they\u2019re united by personal qualities like empathy and\nexcellent listening skills. They\u2019re likely to be articulate and persuasive,\ngood at forming professional relationships and making the case for change.  \n  \nAbove all, they are passionate about what they do. They see CX transformation\nas a mission, not just a role, and they\u2019re committed to making the customer\ncentral to everything a business does.\n\n### A long-term view\n\nAs you embark on a CX program, it\u2019s important to set realistic expectations\nabout the timeframe of your work. CX management should be viewed as a long-\nterm program which will deliver long-term results, and it\u2019s likely that these\nwill grow steadily over time rather than offering immediate ROI.\n\nThe time it takes to see results varies by industry. As[ Colin Shaw of Beyond\nPhilosophy notes](https://beyondphilosophy.com/when-will-i-see-results-my-\ncustomer-experience-program/), if your typical customer contact cycle happens\nacross months or years rather than weeks \u2013 (e.g. if you provide infrequent\nservices like optical prescriptions or car servicing) \u2013 it will take longer\nfor customers to encounter and react to the improvements you\u2019ve made.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely that it will take time for your internal CX process to reach\nits full potential in terms of speed and efficiency. Changing minds,\nbehaviors, culture, and protocols is by nature a long-term process, and\nwithout the right tools and plans in place, it will inevitably take longer.\n\nIs it worth the effort? Absolutely. And businesses willing to make the\ninvestment now will find themselves benefiting in the future as great CX\nbecomes more essential and expected.\n\nHistorical data bears this out, too. Across a 10-year span, businesses who\nmaintained above-average customer satisfaction (using ACSI scores) [delivered\na 400% increase in shareholder returns](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-\nfunctions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/putting-customer-experience-at-the-\nheart-of-next-generation-operating-models#0). Those with below-average scores\nachieved little or no growth in their returns.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nCustomer experience touches every part of a business, and it makes significant\ndemands for change and reevaluation within a company.

In India, the lockdown has further put\na halt on operations for many businesses. One of the many sectors to have been\ngravely impacted by the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown is the rental car\nservices. Road trips are surely not to happen for some time now, corporate\ntravel is also on hold and no one really knows when the situation will get\nbetter.\n\nAmid such uncertain times how are the rental car services providers ensuring\nbusiness continuity and what are the people challenges they are grappling\nwith? In this interaction, Greg Moran, CEO and Co founder of Zoomcar helps us\nfind some answers to these questions and shares how Zoomcar is dealing with\nthis current COVID-19 crisis.\n\n### How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the rental car services space? How\ndo you see your business getting impacted if the crisis continues?\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 resulting in a global pandemic is certainly\nunfortunate. While everyone is advised to observe proper precautions, stay\nindoors, observe social distancing, and maintain proper personal hygiene,\nZoomcar has been coming up with provisions to better take care of their\ncustomers.\n\nIn times of lockdown, mobility is certainly challenged. However, through our\nfleet of over 10,000 cars, Zoomcar is ensuring that mobility-as-a-service is\navailable for anyone who needs it. Furthermore, we are also gearing up to\nensure optimum safety of customers after the lockdown is lifted.\n\n### If the lockdown is to continue for a longer period, how do you plan to\nensure business continuity?\n\nWe are stepping up to ease the emergency transportation woes faced during the\nlockdown period.\n\nWhile we grounded the fleet in accordance with the government\u2019s shutdown\norder, some select vehicles are being utilized to ensure emergency mobility\nfor the frontline workforce, including bankers, healthcare professionals, and\ndelivery executives.\n\nWe are also partnering with various organizations that are considered\nessential in this lockdown period to ensure their employees are provided a\nsafe commuting option. We routinely have thousands of inquiries per day for\nemergency service support and we are fulfilling them whenever possible. We\nhave been able to manage passes in certain scenarios and customers have\nmanaged passes in other instances.\n\n### How are you ensuring the mental well-being of all your employees given the\ncurrent stressful times?\n\nAs we look ahead, it's not entirely clear when the central government will end\nthe lockdown, but there is one thing we are sure about, we will not be laying\noff any employees during this difficult time.\n\nWe wanted to devise a progressive structure that would disproportionately\nimpact the highest earners. We believe this is the most equitable and will\nhelp ensure the company remains clearly on the path to long-term success.\n\nThere will not be pay cuts for employees instead I will defer my entire salary\nuntil June and the Senior most leaders (VP and above) will defer 50 percent\nuntil June. This is not a salary cut, but simply a partial deferment\ntemporarily.\n\n> The ground staff is the backbone of our business, their safety and wellbeing\n> are a priority for us, we will hence not defer any salary for Fleet\n> executives and CEC executives given their present economic realities.\n\nIn these trying times, our utmost priority is to minimize any disruptions in\nessential services, while ensuring safety for individual service providers,\nbusiness partners, and contractors. We have further vowed to fully support any\nmember of the organization who gets infected, by the means of full monthly\nwages, overseeing medical expenses through its medical insurance coverage\npolicy, paid leaves over and above the policy, and a lump sum amount.\n\nI feel that the fight against coronavirus requires private and public sector\nplayers to come together and ensure that we achieve normalcy and make this\nworld safer for everyone\n\n### What are some new ways of working you have adopted in current COVID-19\ntimes?\n\nTeams are now officially getting into the groove in this new working reality.\nIt is important to religiously follow daily stand-ups and staff meetings to\nensure everyone is on the same page. We have seen a significant increase in\nusage of software tools like MS teams and slack with our teams working\nremotely.\n\n### What advice would you like to give business leaders in times of crisis?\n\nIt's probably the most fluid business crisis in recorded history given the\nvarious twists and turns. Never waste a crisis. Use it as a teaching moment\nand as an opportunity for the team to become closer together and work at an\neven greater productivity level.\n\nRead full story\n\n#### Topics: [C-Suite](/category/leadership-\nstrategy/c-suite?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=c-suite \"Browse more in:\nC-Suite\"),\n[#COVID-19](/tag/covid-19?utm_source=post_article&utm_content=covid-19 \"Browse\nmore in: COVID-19\")\n\nDid you find this story helpful?\n\n### Author\n\n[![Drishti Pant](https://res.cloudinary.com/people-\nmatters/image/upload/w_100,h_100,c_lpad,f_auto,q_auto/v1514013807/authors/drishti-\npant.jpg)](/author/drishti-pant)\n\n#### [Drishti Pant](/author/drishti-pant)\n\nDrishti Pant is Senior Associate - Content with People Matters.

It\u2019s like\ntaking video conference meetings to a new level, for anyone with VR, PC web,\nor mobile hardware.\n\nVirtual reality companies like Sine Wave see an opportunity to pivot because\nof the coronavirus. They see the boring Zoom meetings that we\u2019re all forced to\nendure. And the VR companies believe they can provide an experience that is a\nlot more interesting and immersive. [Spaces recently\nannounced](https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/29/spaces-app-enables-folks-to-\nattend-zoom-meetings-in-vr/) something similar where you can attend meetings\nin VR.\n\nBreakroom enables remote teams to meet, work, and hang out together in secure,\nshared virtual spaces. It combines video conferencing, meeting rooms, casual\ngames, live events, and multiplayer hangouts. You can participate via webcam\nvideo or build an animated avatar to wander around the world. It works today\non the PC, Mac, Android, and tethered VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC\nVive.\n\nThe London-based company sees Breakroom as a way for remote teams to engage\nwith each other.\n\n\u201cWhen we went into lockdown in the U.K., we immediately began hearing about\nthe mental health issues in terms of people being isolated,\u201d said Sine Wave\nEntertainment CEO Rohan Freeman, in an interview with VentureBeat. \u201cSome\npeople are used to working at home, but for a lot of people, it really isn\u2019t\nlike that. That absence of a social graph is why we started to build the\nproduct. The goal is to have all of the functionality that you would get from\na standard conferencing like Zoom or GoToMeeting or whatever else. It has chat\nand voice over IP and desktop sharing and webcam sharing and so on and so\nforth. And then, alongside that, you have all of these other activities that\npeople from within one organization can come and do together.\u201d\n\n[![GamesBeat Summit - It's a time of change in the game industry. Hosted\nonline April 28-29.](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/GamesBeatSummitTimeofChange.png?strip=all)![GamesBeat\nSummit - It's a time of change in the game industry. Hosted online April\n28-29.](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/03/GamesBeatSummitTimeofChange.png?strip=all)](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/gamesbeat-\nsummit-2020-tickets-60771924462?aff=article)\n\nI saw it in a demo, and it was like being in a VR game. In one scene, animated\ncharacters sat in chairs around a table, in the middle of a town square\ndecorated with lots of colorful objects. There were also some people tuning in\nvia video, as you can see in the top picture.\n\n## Pivoting fast to Breakroom\n\n![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Breakroom-presentation-\nampitheater.jpg?resize=1024%2C373&strip=all)![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/04/Breakroom-presentation-\nampitheater.jpg?resize=1024%2C373&strip=all)\n\nAbove: An amphitheater for presentations in Breakroom.\n\n _Image Credit: Sine Wave Entertainment_\n\nSine Wave also has its Sinespace virtual world and building tools. But it\nmoved to knock out Breakroom as soon as it realized the opportunity that the\ncoronavirus was creating, Freeman said.\n\nWith more and more teams working from home \u2014 most recently in response to the\ncoronavirus \u2014 major organizations are turning to online services that can\nreplace brick and mortar office functionality. Freeman said some big companies\nare already using it, including tech companies and banks.\n\nBut standard conferencing and collaboration tools are not built to meet social\nand wellness needs. Breakroom provides the video conferencing and media\nsharing tools you would expect from any collaboration platform, and combines\nit with a colorful, welcoming online world filled with team-building\nexercises, brainstorming sessions, casual games, competitions, live events,\noffice parties, break-time meetups, and everyday staff chitchat.\n\n\u201cYou can provide the water cooler moments, where the conversations aren\u2019t\nabout a specific meeting or a specific goal,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cYou can have a\nchat with someone even though you don\u2019t have a specific meeting with them.\nThese accidental engagements are essential to maintaining the culture and the\nability of people to have a sense of who they are. Video conferencing systems\nweren\u2019t built for this kind of experience.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOur goal is to provide a space where all that can happen, where\nteams can stay motivated, stay together, keep the company culture alive, keep\ntheir sense of self alive. And have a sense of community and togetherness. You\ncan do a presentation on a whiteboard. You can walk over to the other side of\nthe park and grab a coffee.\u201d\n\nBusiness owners, executives, and HR directors [can go here for more details\nand to request a demo](http://sine.space/breakroom). (Breakroom is available\nfree to schools and at a 50% discount to registered charities.) Anyone can\ndemo Breakroom for PC, Mac, and Android tablets for free here at\nSinespace.com/breakroom.\n\nFreeman said that virtual worlds also increase memory retention (because\nhumans think and imagine in three dimensions). And he said a social virtual\nworld also provides fun, safe ways to enhance team spirit and to sustain\ninstitutional culture and help build positive momentum.\n\nBuilt completely on Sinespace, a verified solutions provider for Unity,\nBreakroom was built by a team with years of experience developing virtual\nworlds for numerous enterprise clients including IBM, the U.S. Department of\nDefense, NATO, and numerous academic institutions and private companies.\n\nBreakroom is an off-the-shelf solution that makes meeting in VR easy. It has\nfeatures such as a town square hangout that can be branded. It also has a\npresentation amphitheater, private and public meeting rooms, a full suite of\ncommunication tools (VOIP, IM, and in-world email), videoconferencing, media\nand desktop sharing, and regular live social events including music, cinema,\npub quizzes, and seminar sessions.\n\nIt also has numerous casual game regions and game tables, in-world building\nand scene editing, mature APIs for integrating other enterprise applications,\nand HIPAA (health care law) compliant regions for one-to-one therapy sessions.\n\nTo create 3D experiences with low lag and accessibility on tablets and non-\ngaming laptops, Breakroom uses assets from Synty Studios, a production house\nfounded by veterans of WETA Digital which specializes in beautiful but low-\npoly models. Freeman said there are more than 100,000 assets available for\nBreakroom out of more than 2 million available for Sinespace. Sine Wave has 30\npeople on staff.\n\n##  GamesBeat Summit\n\nThe same great speakers & intimate networking\n\nHosted Online\n\nApril 28 - 29\n\n[Register

Best](http://hrmasia.com/category/regular-features/five-of-the-\nbest/) is a weekly series highlighting the best HR service providers across\nSingapore and the Southeast Asia region. It is brought to you by\n[www.hrmasia.com](http://www.hrmasia.com/)._\n\n![](https://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/HRIS-79466851_m-1.jpg)\n\nThere\u2019s simply no way to overstate the value of a good HR Information System\nto any employing organisation. With some of the key touchpoints between staff,\nand across levels, it is the lifeblood of not just the HR team, but the entire\norganisation as a whole.\n\nOf course, it needs to be functional. And for many years, this was the only\nconsideration HR leaders had in choosing a system (or different modules) to\nimplement. As long as the payroll was delivered on time and accurately, and\nexpense claims were able to be examined, the system was said to be doing its\njob.\n\nBut these days, HR leaders are seeing the opportunities and risks within each\ntechnological solution they consider. They know that tech that isn\u2019t fully\nembraced by the workforce can impact retention, which means user experience\nhas become a vital point of difference.\n\nHere are five of the best service providers in this category:\n\n### JUZ TALENT\n\n**[www.juztalent.com](http://www.juztalent.com)**\n\n**+65 6384 3808**\n\n[![](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JuzTalent-\nimage-250x175.jpg)](http://hrmasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/JuzTalent-\nimage.jpg)When businesses are considering investing in a workforce or payroll\nsolution, they\u2019ll likely begin to think about cost-effectiveness, automation,\nand value creation. The driver to JuzTalent's success by acquiring 50,000\nusers within three years has been due to understanding HR and complex payroll\nissues that every business will face in the different part of Southeast Asia.\n\nJuzTalent was built by professionals with deep HR understanding. It is a one-\nof-a-kind HRMS focused on the user\u2019s experience \u2013 from the effortless self-\nservice onboarding to radius clock-in and clock-out, personalised payslips,\nand not forgetting management and leaders are sent light-hearted notifications\nto keep the whole claim and leave processes moving.\n\nFurthermore, every client of JuzTalent is greeted with a realistic drawing of\nproblem-solving and results based insights.

The situation is so dire,\nPresident Donald Trump plans to meet with Senate leaders Tuesday to discuss a\npayroll cut, small business aid and help for hourly workers who might become\nsick.\n\nEver since the [coronavirus](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/) started\ninfecting people in China, Eric Plam, president of Skyroam, a San Francisco-\nbased company that creates and sells Wi-Fi-enabled hotspots to businesses, has\nbeen busy figuring out how to keep his staff safe and his business operating.\n\nThe business has about 120 staff in Shenzhen, China \u2014 out of 180, including 20\nin the U.S. \u2014 all of whom were told by the Chinese government not to come into\nwork after the virus started spreading. At the time, Plam didn't understand\nwhat was happening. \"I first thought it was the flu,\" he says. \"I was\nwondering why they weren't going into work.\"\n\nHe's since called off several in-person meetings, told employees they can work\nfrom home and turned a board meeting, which was supposed to take place in\nBeijing, into a videoconference call using Amazon Chime, an online\nvideoconferencing program.\n\n\"It went really well,\" he says. \"Everyone was able to join without having to\ntravel, and we were able to translate live, so people were able to speak in\nChinese and English as they usually do.\"\n\nAbout 807 miles north in Seattle, Henry Albrecht, CEO of Limeade, an employee\nengagement software company, has been reacting in much the same way. He too\nhas canceled all nonessential travel, while most of the 160 or so employees\nthat work from the Seattle office (100 more already work remotely) are now\nstuck at home. \"There are 12 people here,\" he says. \"Luckily, we're in the\nsoftware business, so working from home is an option.\"\n\n## Not too late to plan\n\nPlam and Albrecht are just two executives out of thousands who run small- to\nmedium-sized businesses now scrambling to figure out how to handle all this\ndisruption.\n\nThis wouldn't have been an issue a decade ago, when American businesses mostly\nconducted business closer to home, but now many companies are global. \"We\nencouraged small businesses to be more global and to export more, and now\nthey're more vulnerable to things like the coronavirus,\" says Andrew Sherman,\na Washington, D.C.-based partner with Seyfarth, a global law firm.\n\nDespite cases continuing to rise and markets sending people and companies in a\npanic, it's not too late for businesses to set up remote workforces,\ncommunicate with staff and prepare for a worsening outbreak. Here are a few\nthings you can do now.\n\n## 1\\. Communicate with staff\n\nOne of the most important things you can do is communicate with your\nemployees. Many are likely concerned about their health and how they can\ncontinue working as more things get shut down.\n\nAlbrecht's own Limeade ONE platform comes with an internal communications\nfeature where people can instant message each other. As soon as the outbreak's\nseriousness became clear, Albrecht set up what he calls a \"care in crisis\"\nchannel that automatically sends push notifications to staff whenever he\nposts. \"There's an intentional importance attached, because the messages are\ncoming from me,\" he says.\n\nIt's in that channel where he provides updates on the virus itself \u2014 he's\nposted a number of CDC videos on COVID-19 and how to monitor oneself for the\ndisease \u2014 along with recommended handwashing and social-distancing procedures,\ntravel updates (most are canceled) and ideas on how to work effectively from\nhome.\n\nEmployees can also post their own messages in that channel, which he says is\nkey. \"It's powerful,\" he says about the two-way communication. \"We want to\nhear from our people as well. We also have the ability to ask people to take a\nquiz so they can tell us if they need more information on something.\"\n\n## 2\\. Invest in work-from-home technology\n\nWhile most people likely have a phone, a computer and an internet connection,\nsome may not have enough bandwidth to do the kind of work they do at the\noffice at home. Some companies may also not be set up with the right\ncollaboration tools, such as internal communications programs or secure Wi-Fi\nnetworks to allow for remote work.\n\nWith coronavirus cases surging, Eric Plam, president of Skyroam in San\nFrancisco, told his employees to work from home.\n\nSkyroam Inc.\n\nWhile Plam has only 20 employees in San Francisco, anyone who is feeling a bit\nunder the weather is encouraged to stay home. At the moment, though, most are\nat work. If anyone does decide to stay home, whether in the U.S., China or in\nhis other offices, in France and Germany, they can use Skyroam's own\ntechnology, which creates Wi-Fi signals by tapping in local data networks.\nThis gives them office-grade internet without having to pay for it themselves.\n\nHis phone has been ringing off the hook over the last couple of weeks with\nmore companies than ever wanting to find ways to help their staff work\nremotely.\n\nFor Albrecht, Microsoft Teams is coming in handy. It's a collaboration program\nthat allows people to video chat and work on Word files together from wherever\nthey may be. Google's G Suite, which comes with collaborative software like\nGoogle docs, sheets and hangouts, is another alternative.\n\n## 3\\. Create a disaster preparedness policy\n\nA lot of companies haven't planned for a crisis on this scale, but as many are\nfinding out now, they need one, says Sherman. A good plan will cover a number\nof things, including procedures around remote work. It should spell out how\npeople should work from home and what tools they'll need to get the job done;\nhow to handle travel; what to do about meetings and more.\n\nIt's also important to include things such as insurance coverage for business\nclosures or trip cancellations, how to get financing when no one is investing,\nwhat lines of credit are in place, supply chain alternatives and more, says\nSherman.\n\nWhile service businesses may be able to continue operating in some way, other\ncompanies, such as restaurants or local movie theaters, will have to think\nhard about how to manage staff and cash flows if people stop going out. \"What\nis plan B?\" he says. \"If something were to happen, do I have the right\nalternative business models in place?\"\n\nAll of this should be documented, says Sherman, as it shows that people are\nthinking about what could happen in a worst-case scenario, and it acts as an\neasy-to-reference guide on what to do, how to communicate and how to keep\nbusiness running in difficult times. \"You need all the elements of a crisis-\nmanagement or disaster-preparedness plan in place,\" he says.\n\nYou need all the elements of a crisis-management or disaster-preparedness plan\nin place.\n\nAndrew Sherman\n\na partner with global law firm Seyfarth\n\nNo matter what happens, small- and medium-sized businesses will no doubt take\nsome sort of hit to their bottom line. While the government may step in to\nhelp \u2014 [some democrats have introduced a bill in Congress to provide up to $2\nmillion in interest-free loans to companies affected by the\noutbreak](https://velazquez.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/velazquez-\nchu-meng-bill-would-assist-small-businesses-harmed-coronavirus) \u2014 business\nowners need to be proactive and do what they need to do to keep their doors\nopen, even if their employees aren't there.\n\nWhile COVID-19 appears to be getting worse in the U.S., Plam isn't panicking.\nHis staff are set up to work from wherever they can, and while he does\nanticipate busier times ahead when people start traveling again, for now it's\nmostly business as usual.\n\n\"We remain optimistic that we'll get past this and the economy will roar back\nto life,\" he says. \"We may have to catch up on some things, but employees are\nprepared.\"\n\n**More from Invest in You:**  \n[ **How to build a cash reserve if coronavirus causes you to miss\nwork**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-how-to-build-a-cash-\ncushion-as-outbreak-spreads.html)  \n[ **Avoid this investing mistake as coronavirus fears grip\nmarkets**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/24/avoid-this-investing-mistake-as-\ncoronavirus-fears-grip-the-markets.html) **  \n**[ **Save $1,000 without sacrificing anything you really\nlove**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/23/in-3-months-5-easy-things-could-pad-\nyour-account-by-1000.html)\n\n **SIGN UP:** [Money 101 is an 8-week learning course to financial freedom,\ndelivered weekly to your inbox](https://www.cnbc.com/money101/).\n\n **CHECK OUT:**[Clean your phone at least once a day, says infectious disease\nspecialist \u2014 here's how](https://grow.acorns.com/how-to-clean-your-iphone-\nandroid/) **** via ****[Grow with\nAcorns+CNBC](https://grow.acorns.com/?gsi=55e11w).\n\n _Disclosure: NBCUniversal and Comcast Ventures are investors in_[\n_Acorns_](https://www.acorns.com/?s1=cnbc_invest_in_you) _._\n\nRelated Tags\n\n  * [Telecommuting](https://www.cnbc.com/search/?query=Telecommuting)\n  * [Small business](https://www.cnbc.com/search/?query=Small%20business)\n  * [Business](https://www.cnbc.com/search/?query=Business)\n  * [Investment strategy](https://www.cnbc.com/search/?query=Investment%20strategy)\n  * [Personal saving](https://www.cnbc.com/search/?query=Personal%20saving)\n\n## [More In Invest in You: Ready.

What's worse, is there is an ever-present risk that\nsmall errors here can lead to big (and even more time-consuming) disputes and\nissues later down the track.\n\nThat's why specialised software can be such an important tool for HR\nprofessionals of all levels. Taking that difficult and risk-heavy task out of\nthe in-tray through an automated system gives HR leaders much greater\nopportunity to concentrate on building effective and productive cultures\nacross their workforce.

Graff is a journalist, historian, and director of cyber\ninitiatives at The Aspen Institute. He can be reached at[ [email\nprotected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-\nprotection#5d3a3c2f2f382929733a2f3c3b3b1d3a303c3431733e3230)._\n\nThis week, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams\n[promised](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/05/surgeon-general-pearl-\nharbor-moment-165729) that we\u2019re entering the darkest days of the Covid-19\nepidemic: \u201cThis is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment. Only,\nit\u2019s not going to be localized, it\u2019s going to be happening all over the\ncountry. And I want America to understand that,\u201d Adams told Fox News\u2019 Chris\nWallace.\n\nAdams\u2019 metaphor, evoking the two deadliest\u2014and most shocking\u2014moments of modern\nAmerican history, came on the fourth consecutive day that U.S. deaths from\nCovid-19 crossed the 1,000 mark. Across Saturday, Sunday and Monday, more\nAmericans were killed by the novel coronavirus than in either Pearl Harbor,\nthe 9/11 attacks or the Civil War battle of Antietam. The days ahead surely\nwill include an even grimmer toll.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet Adams\u2019 metaphor of this as our new \u201c9/11 moment\u201d is more apt than he\nlikely intended: Comparing the events is about more than just a story of\ncasualties\u2014it is also a story about government\u2019s failure. Both Pearl Harbor\nand the 9/11 attacks occurred, in part, because the U.S. government and\nintelligence failed to see the attacks looming. We were caught unprepared, and\nAmericans paid for that mistake with their lives.\n\nAfter 9/11, we swore to never let that happen again. \u201cNever again\u201d was the\nmantra handed down to the nation\u2019s leaders by George W. Bush in the White\nHouse on September 12. We devoted billions\u2014trillions, even\u2014of dollars after\n2001 to fixing the intelligence and information-gathering problems identified\nby the 9/11 Commission, and Congress and George W. Bush worked through the\nbiggest reorganization of the government since 1947 to create two entirely new\nentities to help prevent \u201cthe next 9/11\u201d: The Department of Homeland Security,\nan attempt to bring together all the agencies tasked with protecting the\ncountry at home, and the Office of Director of National Intelligence, a\ncoordinator for the nation\u2019s 17 disparate intelligence agencies to ensure that\nthe country better understood both the big picture and the small picture of\nwhat was happening around the world.\n\nUnfortunately, President Donald Trump\u2019s routine, day-to-day mismanagement of\nthe government has left both organizations\u2014the very entities we tasked as a\nnation to prevent the next 9/11\u2014riddled with vacancies and temporary officials\nas the novel coronavirus rapidly spread from a small blip in China to a global\nhealth and economic catastrophe. In fact, the four top jobs at DHS and ODNI\nhave all been filled with temporary acting officials for literally every day\nthat Covid-19 has been on the world stage.\n\nWhile we often think of those jobs as focused on protecting against terrorism,\nboth agencies have critical public health roles, too; U.S. intelligence spent\nthe winter racing to understand how serious a threat Covid-19 truly was and\ndeciphering the extent of [China\u2019s cover-\nup](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/cia-coronavirus-china.html)\nof its epidemic. Just last week, news broke about a [special\nreport](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-01/china-concealed-\nextent-of-virus-outbreak-u-s-intelligence-says) prepared by U.S. intelligence\ndocumenting China\u2019s deception about the disease\u2019s spread\u2014information that, had\nit been more accurately captured and understood, might have caused a faster,\nharder response and lessened the economic and personal toll of the epidemic at\nhome.\n\nYet Trump has churned through officials overseeing the very intelligence that\nmight have helped understand the looming crisis. At Liberty Crossing, the\nheadquarters of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the\ngovernment will have been without a Senate-confirmed director for eight months\nas of next week; last summer, Trump accepted the resignation of Dan Coats and\nforced out the career principal deputy of national intelligence, Sue Gordon.\nCoats\u2019 temporary stand-in, career intelligence official Joseph Maguire, then\nserved so long that he was coming close to timing out of his role\u2014federal law\nusually lets officials serve only 210 days before relinquishing the acting\npost\u2014when Trump ousted him too, as well as the acting career principal deputy.\nIn their place, at the end of February\u2014weeks after the U.S. already recorded\nits first Covid-19 case\u2014Trump installed U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard\nGrenell as his latest acting director, the role that by law is meant to be the\npresident\u2019s top intelligence adviser. Grenell has the least intelligence\nexperience of any official ever to occupy director\u2019s suite.\n\nThis Friday, the role of Homeland Security secretary will have been vacant for\nan entire year, ever since Kirstjen Nielsen was forced out over Trump\u2019s belief\nshe wasn\u2019t tough enough on border security. DHS has numerous critical roles in\nany domestic crisis, but its acting secretary, Chad Wolf, has fumbled through\nthe epidemic; in February, Wolf couldn\u2019t answer seemingly straightforward\nquestions on Capitol Hill from Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana\nabout the [nation\u2019s preparedness](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/watch-trump-\nhomeland-chief-stumped-at-hearing-by-coronavirus-questions-from-republican-\nsenator/)\u2014what models were predicting about the outbreak, how many respirators\nthe government had stockpiled, even how Covid-19 was transmitted. \u201cYou\u2019re\nsupposed to keep us safe. And you need to know the answers to these\nquestions,\u201d Kennedy finally snapped at Wolf. Wolf has been notably absent ever\nsince from the White House podium during briefings about the nation\u2019s epidemic\nresponse.\n\n\u201cActings\u201d often struggle to be successful precisely because they\u2019re\ntemporary\u2014their word carries less weight with their own workforce, with other\ngovernment agencies or on Capitol Hill\u2014and they rarely have the opportunity to\nset and drive their own agenda, push for broad organizational change or even\nlearn the ropes of how to be successful in the job given the usually brief\nperiod of their tenure. Anyone who has ever changed jobs or companies knows\nhow long it can take to feel like you understand a new organization, a new\nculture or shape a new role.\n\nAnd yet up and down the org chart at DHS, there are people still learning the\nropes. DHS is riddled with critical vacancies; according to the _Washington\nPost_ \u2019s [appointment\ntracker](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-\nadministration-appointee-tracker/database/), just 35 percent of its top roles\nare filled. Its chief of staff, executive secretary and general counsel are\nall acting officials, and there\u2019s no Senate-confirmed deputy secretary, no\nundersecretary for management, no chief financial officer, no chief\ninformation officer, no undersecretary for science and technology, nor a\ndeputy undersecretary for science and technology.\n\nEven as we face a global crisis with complex travel restrictions and health\nguidelines, there are no Senate-confirmed leaders of any of DHS\u2019 three border\nand immigration agencies\u2014Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Nor is there\na deputy administrator at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), as\nthe airline industry faces an existential cutback to global travel.\n\nMatthew Albence, acting head of ICE, which faces a [growing Covid-19\nproblem](https://www.inquirer.com/news/ice-immigration-migrant-detention-\ncenter-first-coronavirus-in-pennsylvania-20200404.html) in its national\nnetwork of detention facilities, has been \u201cacting\u201d for so long that he\u2019s\nsurpassed the 220 day-statutory limit for the role and instead is now\ntechnically the \u201csenior official performing the duties of the director,\u201d a\nlegal term of art that\u2019s become all too common around the federal government\nas vacancies linger in the Trump era. Ken Cuccinelli, the similarly titled\n\u201csenior official performing the duties of the USCIS director,\u201d who is\nsimultaneously also DHS\u2019 temporary No. 2, the \u201csenior official performing the\nduties of the deputy secretary,\u201d is currently appealing a court ruling that\nhe\u2019s not even [legally serving](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/02/ken-\ncuccinelli-rejects-judge-appointment-ruling-118747) at DHS.\n\nWhen Trump turned to DHS\u2019 Federal Emergency Management Agency last month to\noversee the federal government\u2019s coronavirus response, the agency lacked\nSenate-confirmed officials in either of its deputy roles\u2014including its deputy\noverseeing preparedness and continuity of government planning, a function that\nmay become all-too-important in the days ahead if the virus sickens government\nleaders, as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already been\nhospitalized.\n\nAnd the assistant secretary for countering Weapons of Mass Destruction\u2014the\nperson who oversees DHS\u2019 chief medical officer, the doctor designated to\nadvise the DHS secretary and the head of FEMA? That job is vacant, too.\nMeanwhile, in addition to its role serving the nation, DHS itself faces a\n[growing number](https://twitter.com/Haleaziz/status/1247193856413536257) of\nCovid-19 infections in its own workforce\u2014up to 600 cases as of Monday\u2019s\nnumbers, including 270 TSA employees and 160 CBP employees.\n\nThe effect of these vacancies ripple further than most people realize. Since\nvacant roles awaiting either an official appointment or a Senate-confirmed\nnominee are always filled by \u201cacting\u201d officials pulled from other parts of the\norganization or broader government, even more offices are understaffed as\npeople do double-duty and as their own positions are filled with other\n\u201cactings\u201d behind them. Grenell, even as he fills in as director of National\nIntelligence, continues technically to be the U.S. ambassador to Germany,\nmeaning that amid the huge economic uncertainty around Covid-19 epidemic the\nU.S. is without a high-level envoy to the largest economy in Europe. For the\n14 months he was \u201cacting\u201d White House chief of staff, up until March\n31\u2014another horse Trump changed midstream in the epidemic\u2014Mick Mulvaney was\nstill technically serving as the director of Office of Management and Budget,\na normally critical role itself overseeing the nation\u2019s spending. In\nMulvaney\u2019s absence, Russell Vought, OMB\u2019s deputy, filled in as the acting\ndirector\u2014leaving his own job, normally its own full-time role, to be filled in\nby others, and so on.\n\nIn government agencies, deputies are not like the vice president\u2014a spare role\nkept around, if needed. Often, the \u201cdeputy\u201d role is the most important figure\nin the day-to-day operations of the department or agency\u2014the person who runs\nthe bureaucracy and organization while the principal (the secretary or\ndirector) attends to the policy and the politics. Robbing an agency or\ndepartment of a principal and forcing the deputy to fill in means the\norganization will be running at reduced effectiveness, with less guidance,\ndirection and oversight.\n\nThe vacancies at DHS and ODNI are hardly the whole story of how Trump has\nhampered the very jobs meant to protect the nation in crisis. While much\nattention has been focused on Trump\u2019s decision to shutter the National\nSecurity Council\u2019s [pandemic\nunit](https://apnews.com/ce014d94b64e98b7203b873e56f80e9a), less attention has\nfocused on an even more critical change in the NSC\u2019s structure. Another key\npost-9/11 reform was the creation of a White House homeland security adviser,\na domestic equal to the national security adviser, a post created just days\nafter 9/11 by President George W. Bush and filled at first by Tom Ridge, who\nwould go on to be the first Homeland Security secretary. Presidents Bush and\nObama for years had at their beck and call senior, sober homeland security\nadvisers like Fran Townsend, Ken Wainstein, John Brennan and Lisa Monaco;\nMonaco helped oversee the nation\u2019s response to Ebola and led the incoming\nTrump administration through a [pandemic response\nexercise](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2020-03-03/pandemic-disease-\nthreat-national-security) in the days before the inauguration to highlight how\ncritical such an incident could be.\n\nOver the course of his administration, Trump effectively has done away with\nthe role of homeland security adviser; when John Bolton took over as national\nsecurity adviser, one of his first acts was to fire Homeland Security Advisor\nTom Bossert and downgrade the role in rank. Ever since, the Trump NSC has\nsidelined the officials who filled the role. In February, as Covid-19 loomed\ndomestically, Trump actually even [shuffled](https://www.military.com/daily-\nnews/2020/02/08/trump-appoints-coast-guard-admiral-recovery-czar-puerto-\nrico.html) the Coast Guard official then filling the post out to a new job,\noverseeing Puerto Rico\u2019s disaster recovery.\n\nFurther afield from the Homeland Security roles, the empty holes in federal\norganization charts will continue to slow and hamper the government\u2019s ability\nto respond at the speed and scale necessary to address a crisis of\nunprecedented complexity.\n\nAt the Treasury Department, Secretary Steven Mnuchin began confronting the\ncrisis without a chief of staff or legislative director. As Bloomberg\n[reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-04/mnuchin-s-empty-\njobs-stretch-treasury-team-thin-in-global-crisis), \u201cOf 20 Senate confirmed\nroles reporting to the secretary, seven aren\u2019t filled, and four are occupied\nby acting officials. The domestic finance unit, which should be handling the\nbrunt of the work related to the coronavirus outbreak, is particularly empty.\nIt has no top boss and is missing three assistant secretaries, who are the\nnext level down.\u201d\n\nAt the Pentagon, the Navy faced last week\u2019s [Covid-19\ncrisis](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/magazine/modly-crozier-\ncoronavirus.html) aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt without a\nSenate-confirmed Navy secretary; Richard Spencer departed last fall amid the\ncontroversy of Trump\u2019s pardoning of a Navy SEAL accused of war crimes. Now\nthat Spencer\u2019s successor as acting Navy secretary has himself resigned amid\nthe carrier fiasco, the undersecretary of the Army\u2014the only one of the three\nservice under secretaries now filled and a post he took up only two weeks\nago\u2014will apparently be filling as acting Navy secretary. To say that it\u2019s\nless-than-ideal for all of those roles\u2014which serve as each military service\u2019s\nchief management officer\u2014to be vacant in the midst of an unprecedented, global\ncrisis is an understatement. Across the building, roughly a third of the\nPentagon\u2019s top jobs are vacant or filled with acting officials\u2014an\nadministration high. The undersecretary for personnel and readiness, Matthew\nDonovan, has been on the job for only about two weeks\u2014the job sat vacant since\nJuly 2018\u2014and there\u2019s currently no undersecretary for policy.\n\nLast year, the top job at the Food and Drug Administration, the role\noverseeing the nation\u2019s pharmaceuticals, sat vacant for nearly eight months;\nthe latest occupant, Stephen Hahn, took over in December, nearly a month after\nthe first cases of Covid-19 were reported in Wuhan, China. At the Department\nof Veterans Affairs, which oversees a massive health care network and legally\nserves to supplement the civilian health care system in an emergency like the\ncurrent epidemic, there\u2019s no deputy secretary, general counsel or\nundersecretary for health.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s an acting director over at the Office of Personnel\nManagement\u2014the federal government\u2019s equivalent of an HR department\u2014even as the\nU.S. government\u2019s 2 million civilian employees face the massive challenge of\nworking from home and carrying on essential duties amid the Covid-19 crisis.\nOh, and that acting director of OPM, Michael Rigas, who himself just took over\nin late March when the OPM director, who had been there for all of six months,\n[quit](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/opm-chief-resigns-134541) just\nas the epidemic boiled over? He\u2019s _also_ serving as the acting deputy director\nat OMB. Confused? You\u2019d hardly be alone. Wondering how someone can effectively\nlead one mission-critical organization while simultaneously working as the\ndeputy of another? The answer is you can\u2019t.\n\nAll of these vacancies are simple statements. They say nothing about the\ncompetence or longevity of the officials actually in any of the key roles,\nboth of which deserve separate indictments: Trump is already on his\n[fourth](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/06/task-mark-meadows-control-\ncrisis-save-presidency-167323) White House chief of staff, his fifth homeland\nsecurity secretary and his fourth defense secretary\u2014though the current\noccupant, Mark Esper, actually is technically the fifth person to occupy the\nrole, since he was also \u201cacting\u201d secretary for 21 days before handing over the\nreins to Richard Spencer for eight days last summer while he was officially\nnominated for the permanent position.\n\nSimilarly, the experience of the officials who are in charge of many key\ndepartments and agencies is troublesome; Grenell, as acting DNI, has never\nworked in the intelligence community before, whereas his predecessors have\nbeen admirals, generals and the heads of various intelligence agencies\nthemselves. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, the few leaders who do\nexist badly lack experience in crisis response, as the department\u2019s inspector\ngeneral [reported](https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-20-02221-120.pdf) in the\nearly days of the coronavirus crisis. As the _New York Times_\n[wrote:](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/politics/coronavirus-expertise-\ntrump.html) \u201cAt the Department of Veterans Affairs, workers are scrambling to\norder medical supplies on Amazon after its leaders, lacking experience in\ndisaster responses, failed to prepare for the onslaught of patients at its\nmedical centers.\u201d The new head of the Office of Presidential Personnel, which\nis in charge of choosing appointees across the government, was fired earlier\nin the administration over [allegations of financial\ncrimes](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-put-john-mcentee-fired-alleged-\nfinancial-crimes-personnel-office-2020-2), and one of its top deputies is\nstill a [college student](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/25/college-\nsenior-white-house-personnel-office-117493).\n\nAll of these revolving doors, empty offices and \u201ctemps\u201d are precisely by\ndesign. Trump has [spoken\nregularly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-hes-in-no-hurry-\nto-replace-acting-cabinet-\nmembers/2019/01/06/afac5fea-11e4-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html) about his\npreference for \u201cacting\u201d officials, saying they give him \u201cflexibility.\u201d\n\nSomeday, reports will be written about how the U.S. government failed in its\nresponse to the Covid-19 epidemic\u2014failures that will surely have cost\nadditional thousands of lives, additional millions of lost jobs, and\nadditional billions (perhaps even trillions) in economic damages by the time\nthis virus is behind us. And yet while those reports will surely point out\nspecific management failures and lost opportunities to arrest the spread of\nCovid-19, the most basic conclusion of those future reports could already be\nwritten: Donald Trump\u2019s _Apprentice_ -style staffing bake-offs and his oft-\nvoiced [predilection for acting\nofficials](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/21/trump-has-had-\nan-acting-official-cabinet-level-job-1-out-every-9-days/) kept the U.S.\ngovernment distracted, off-kilter and understaffed.\n\nTrump is obviously not responsible for the appearance of the novel\ncoronavirus\u2014but he is responsible for the government\u2019s spiraling failure to\nrespond appropriately in a timely manner. He has ignored the hiring practices,\nprotocols, norms and expertise that would have given him and the federal\ngovernment a better shot at defeating Covid-19. Three years into his\nadministration and with a Republican-controlled Senate ready to move nominees\nthrough to confirmation, he didn\u2019t build the national leadership we needed.\nThat inescapable fact is Donald Trump\u2019s fault.\n\nThe \u201cnext 9/11\u201d is happening right now because Trump ignored the lessons of\nthe last one.\n\n  * Filed Under:\n  * [Department Of Homeland Security](https://www.politico.com/news/department-of-homeland-security),\n  * [National Security Council](https://www.politico.com/news/national-security-council),\n  * [9/11](https://www.politico.com/news/9-11),\n  * [Sept. 11](https://www.politico.com/news/sept-11),\n  * [Donald Trump](https://www.politico.com/news/donald-trump),\n  * [Donald Trump 2020](https://www.politico.com/news/trump-2020-presidential-election),\n  * [Coronavirus](https://www.politico.com/latest-news-updates/coronavirus)\n\nShow Comments\n\n[ ******** POLITICO ](https://www.politico.com/)\n\n  * [ Facebook ](http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?pco=tbx32nj-1.0&url=https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/04/07/trump-dismantled-the-very-jobs-meant-to-stop-the-covid-19-epidemic-173347&pubid=politico.com)\n  * [ Twitter ](http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?pco=tbx32nj-1.0&url=https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/04/07/trump-dismantled-the-very-jobs-meant-to-stop-the-covid-19-epidemic-173347&text=Trump+Broke+the+Agencies+That+Were+Supposed+To+Stop+the+Covid-19+Epidemic&pubid=politico.com&via=politico)\n  * Link\n    * Link Copied\n\n  * More\n    * [ Mail ](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c5fab1aaf8e3a4a8b5feb6b0a7afa0a6b1f891b7b0a8b5e587b7aaaea0e5b1ada0e584a2a0aba6aca0b6e591ada4b1e592a0b7a0e596b0b5b5aab6a0a1e591aae596b1aab5e5b1ada0e586aab3aca1e8f4fce580b5aca1a0a8aca6e3a4a8b5fea7aaa1bcf8adb1b1b5b6ffeaeab2b2b2ebb5aaa9acb1aca6aaeba6aaa8eaaba0b2b6eaa8a4a2a4bfacaba0eaf7f5f7f5eaf5f1eaf5f2eab1b7b0a8b5e8a1acb6a8a4abb1a9a0a1e8b1ada0e8b3a0b7bce8afaaa7b6e8a8a0a4abb1e8b1aae8b6b1aab5e8b1ada0e8a6aab3aca1e8f4fce8a0b5aca1a0a8aca6e8f4f2f6f6f1f2)\n    * [ Reddit ](http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/04/07/trump-dismantled-the-very-jobs-meant-to-stop-the-covid-19-epidemic-173347&title=Trump+Broke+the+Agencies+That+Were+Supposed+To+Stop+the+Covid-19+Epidemic)\n    * [ WhatsApp ](https://wa.me/?text=https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/04/07/trump-dismantled-the-very-jobs-meant-to-stop-the-covid-19-epidemic-173347)\n\n  * [About Us](https://www.politico.com/about-us)\n  * [Advertising](https://www.politico.com/advertising)\n  * [Breaking News Alerts](https://www.politico.com/subscribe/breaking-news-alerts)\n  * [Careers](https://www.politico.com/careers)\n  * [Credit Card Payments](https://secure.politico.com/payment)\n  * [Digital Edition](http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?bypass=true&PBID=74262970-aa07-44b3-80c8-21fa8a8ac376)\n  * [FAQ](https://www.politico.com/faq)\n  * [Feedback](https://www.politico.com/feedback)\n  * [Headlines](https://www.politico.com/politics)\n  * [Photos](https://www.politico.com/gallery)\n  * [POWERJobs](http://www.powerjobs.com/)\n  * [Press](https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-press)\n  * [Print Subscriptions](https://www.politico.com/subscriptions)\n  * [Write For Us](https://www.politico.com/write-for-us)\n  * [RSS](https://www.politico.com/rss)\n  * [Site Map](https://www.politico.com/sitemap)\n\n  * [Terms of Service](https://www.politico.com/terms-of-service)\n  * [Privacy Policy](https://www.politico.com/privacy-policy)\n  * [Do not sell my info](https://www.politico.com/do-not-sell)\n\n(C) 2020 POLITICO LLC\n\n"}, {"item": "QuickBooks Online Payroll now a full-service suite -

Small businesses can now run\npayroll and file taxes automatically, as well as receive tax penalty\nprotection and access on-demand human resources, health benefits, and workers\u2019\ncompensation.\n\nQuickBooks Online Payroll now comes in three tier options,\n[_Core_](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/core/),[\n_Premium_](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/premium/) __ and[\n_Elite_](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/elite/). All three tiers\ninclude payroll and automated tax filing, and Premium and Elite come with\nTSheets time tracking. Intuit acquired TSheets in 2017.  \n![](https://arizent.brightspotcdn.com/8c/83/2e1193c14fc89c22b24dd02d1c80/intuit-\ncampus.jpg)  \nThe TSheets acquisition has proven key to the developing out of QuickBooks\u2019\npayroll products. Laurent Sellier, vice president and business leader of\nQuickBooks Online Payroll, said that he learned how important TSheets had\nbecome to QuickBooks Online Payroll users during one of Intuit\u2019s accountant\ncouncil meetings, where Intuit staff listen to ideas and insights from\naccountants.\n\n\u201cI asked one accountant to share how he runs his business, and he said any\ntime he has a new customer that needs payroll, they provide full service\npayroll, including TSheets every time,\u201d Sellier recalled. \u201cAfter that, it\u2019s\nall automated. At that point, I talked to some other leaders at Intuit about\nwhether time tracking should be something we provide. Six months later, we\nbought TSheets. Now the big innovation \u2014 making TSheets available as part of\nPayroll so you don\u2019t have to buy something else. We removed the seams between\nPayroll and TSheets. It\u2019s one offering, well integrated.\n\nAnother highlight of the new suite is tax penalty protection, offered in the\nElite tier. This feature protects the accountant in case of error in tax\nfilings, Intuit assuming the risk.\n\nQuickBooks Online Payroll users also now have the option to have live experts\nreview their setup. The experts are full time Intuit staff on the Payroll\nsupport team who specialize in payroll onboarding.\n\nFinally, a feature worthy of mention is the new online information portal,\naccessible to any user, including clients. The portal was created in\npartnership with HR tech provider Mammoth, and is integrated directly into\nQuickBooks Online Payroll.\n\n\u201cWe hear not only from small businesses but also from accountants that HR is a\ngrowing area for questions and stress,\u201d said Sandy Edwards, group product\nmanager for QuickBooks Online Payroll. \u201cThat\u2019s why we created an online portal\npowered by Mammoth, giving users access to a host of questions, forms, and\ninformation. It\u2019s embedded in QuickBooks, so they don\u2019t have to go anywhere\nelse.\u201d\n\nThe key features of the new QuickBooks Online Payroll, broken down by tier,\nare as follows:\n\n **Core**  \nPreviously known as QuickBooks Online Self-Service Payroll, QuickBooks Online\nPayroll Core is QuickBooks\u2019 simplest solution for automated payroll and\nincludes:\n\n  * Full-service payroll includes automated tax and forms;\n  * Auto Payroll;\n  * [ _Next-day direct deposit_](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/direct-deposit/);\n  * Automated federal and state payroll taxes (including year-end filings);\n  * A Workforce Portal for employees;\n  * Product support from U.S.-based experts;\n  * [ _Health benefits_](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/employee-benefits/) for employees powered by Simply Insured.\n\n **Premium**  \nPreviously known as QuickBooks Online Full-Service Payroll, QuickBooks Online\nPayroll Premium includes all the features of Core, as well as:\n\n  * [ _Same-day direct deposit_](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/payroll/direct-deposit/) _;_\n  * Time tracking on the go;\n  * Expert setup review;\n  * HR support center powered by Mammoth.\n\n **Elite**  \nThis new, top-tier offering was designed specifically for growing businesses.\nIn addition to all the features provided in QuickBooks Online Payroll Premium,\nElite customers receive:  \n\n  * Manage projects and track time on the go;\n  * White glove customized setup by U.S.-based specialists;\n  * [ _Tax Penalty

Often enough, the phrase human\nresource management system (HRMS) is thrown into the alphabet soup as well.\nThis is a classic case of oversimplification leading to complications. These\nare not exactly the same things, though they deal with the cornerstone of\nevery organization \u2013 people. HRIS and HCM are both systematic approaches to\nmanage people better and to leverage the human potential of every\norganization. That said, their internal systems and processes have certain\ncardinal differences that cannot be overlooked._**\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834b324a1a1.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n  * **What Is an HRIS?**\n  * **What Is HCM?**\n  * **HRIS vs. HCM: What's the Difference?**\n\n## **What Is an HRIS?**\n\n[Human resource information system\n(HRIS)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/) can be defined as a software or online solution that is\nused for data entry, data tracking, and the data management of all human\nresources operations of an organization. An HRIS thus deals with all things\ndata and helps translate that to on-demand information and insights.\n\nThe six key HRIS systems and working components that most solutions offer are\nas follows:\n\n  * Database management\n  * Time and labor management\n  * Payroll functions\n  * Benefits management\n  * Employee interface\n  * Talent acquisition and retention\n\n  \n**Learn More:[What Is HRIS? System, Model, and\nApplication](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)**\n\n## **What Is HCM?**\n\nHuman capital management (HCM) is defined as a set of practices for human\nresource management with the goal of achieving organizational competency by\nfocusing on workforce acquisition, management, and optimization.\n\nToday, there are multiple HCM point and suite solutions available in a rather\ncrowded market. For example, multi-feature suite offerings by Workday, SAP,\nOracle, PeopleSoft, BambooHR, Zoho People and many other players offer a wide\nvariety of solutions.\n\nThe three pillars of human capital management are:\n\n### **1\\. Talent acquisition**\n\n  * Recruitment / eRecruitment\n  * ATS (application tracking system)\n  * Onboarding\n\n### **2\\. Talent management**\n\n  * Time and attendance\n  * Payroll\n  * Performance management\n  * Culture-building\n\n### **3\\.

Definition, Process and\nStrategy](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-human-capital-management/)**\n\n## **HRIS vs. HCM: What\u2019s the Difference?**\n\nThe primary difference between and HRIS and HCM suite solutions is that the\nHCM suite usually includes all the HRIS processes and systems under its\numbrella.\n\n![](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 1. Comparing HRIS, HCM, and HRMS_**\n\n### **Does HCM have a wider scope?**\n\n  \nAs the figure below depicts, an HCM suite not only takes care of all HRIS sub-\nprocesses but also manages onboarding functions, **[performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)** , position mapping, and succession\nplanning, salary/compensation benchmarking, global connectivity, compliance\n(for geographically spread out organizations), and HR analytics.\n\nTo provide you with a holistic picture, we\u2019ve also included a depiction of\nwhere HRMS fits into the picture, or rather how HCM and HRIS both fit under\nthe broader umbrella of HRMS.\n\nMost HCM suites today are trying to incorporate payroll and labor management\nwithin their functionality and thus expanding their span of control to include\nHRMS offerings.\n\nWhat needs to be kept in mind while navigating this HR solutions market,\nespecially in an age of digital and data dependency, is that there are quite a\nfew talent management (TM) point solution vendors who often dub themselves HCM\nvendors to elevate their brand and to expand their clientele.\n\nWhether you choose an HRIS or an HCM suite depends on the talent management\ncapabilities you require and the extra functionalities that your people\nfunctions will benefit from. Moreover, time- and labor-centric point solutions\noften market their offerings as workforce management, but that is not the same\nas talent management.\n\n![HRIS Vs. HCM Vs. HRMS](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n### **Core features and capabilities**\n\n  \nThe core capabilities of HRIS and HCM solutions differ significantly. While an\nHRIS helps with recruiting, leave management, workflows, training, and\ndevelopment, benefits administration, self-service portals, compensation\nmanagement, and personnel tracking, there are often organizational needs that\ngo beyond the acquisition and management of data.\n\nCore HCM offerings, on the other hand, include all HRIS features along with\ntracking employee performance, [onboarding\nprocesses](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/), analytics (from all HRIS data)\nand workforce planning with regard to mapping the talent path ahead.\n\n**Learn More:[What is People Management?

are still struggling to make upskilling a reality.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | February 3, 2020 \u2022 3 min read\n\nTopics:

making serious inroads in\ntoday\u2019s workplace, it may come as little surprise that\n[upskilling](https://hrexecutive.com/now-is-the-time-to-start-upskilling-your-\nworkforce/) and reskilling will be key to evolving employee competencies that\n[complement technological innovation](https://hrexecutive.com/jason-averbook-\ncreating-a-digital-mindset-for-a-new-decade-of-work/), according a new survey.\n\nUnfortunately, the same survey, the [_2020 Talent Trends\nReport_](https://content.randstadsourceright.com/2020-talent-trends-report)\nreleased by Randstad Sourceright, found that, while 91% of human capital\nleaders believe it\u2019s their company's responsibility to provide reskilling to\nmeet business needs, only 22% are currently doing so to address talent\nscarcity. Nearly one-third of respondents who said they intend to offer\nreskilling aren't sure how to get it done.\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nThe good news is most employers (66%) plan to provide training and reskilling\nin the area of artificial intelligence, while 60% plan to develop workers'\nsoft skills. The findings mirrored those in the company's 2019 research on\nemployees, wherein their most desired skills included both technical\ncapabilities (43%) and soft skills, such as communication (41%).\n\nThe survey, which included responses from more than 800 C-suite and HR\nleaders, also found that human capital professionals see talent\nfluidity\u2014defined as the ability of workers to mold their skills to adapt to\nautomation, digitalization and other changing needs of their organization\u2014as\ncritical to the future of work.\n\n\"Digitalization has changed the way we work and has redefined the skills that\nare most important for employees to possess,\" says Rebecca Henderson, CEO of\nRandstad global businesses and executive board member. \"Yet, while employers\nhave acknowledged that it is crucial for their businesses to reskill staff to\nkeep up with changing technology and bolster the soft skills that only humans\ncan possess, it is troubling that so few companies are currently offering this\nnecessary training.\"\n\n[**Also see:** 5 reasons to attend HRE\u2019s Health & Benefits Leadership\nConference](https://hrexecutive.com/5-reasons-to-attend-hres-health-benefits-\nleadership-conference/)\n\nAdvertisement  \n  \n\nIn addition to AI and soft skills, companies also plan to train existing\nemployees in analytics skills (59%), technical capabilities (57%) and cloud\ncomputing (54%). Thirty-eight percent of respondents view reskilling as an\nimportant measure for redeploying talent who are at risk of losing their jobs\ndue to automation.\n\nOther key findings from the _2020 Talent Trends Report_ include:\n\n  * Internal mobility: About 47% of companies will be increasing investments in their internal-mobility programs in 2020, up from 39% in 2016. In Randstad Sourceright's 2019 survey of talent, 31% of working professionals said their ideal employer should offer career progression opportunities.\n  * Automated talent acquisition: Seventy-one percent of C-suite and human capital leaders say that technology has made the recruitment process simpler and more efficient for them, and 72% believe that technology is helping them make smarter hiring decisions. Eighty-one percent also say talent analytics play a critical role in sourcing, attracting, engaging and retaining talent.\n  * Digital insights: Nearly half (47%) of employers are investing in predictive analytics for talent, and a majority (54%) are investing in digital specialists to support HR. In Randstad Sourceright's 2019 research, a majority (60%) of working professionals also said they would have more job opportunities if they possessed broader digital and tech-focused skill sets.\n  * Workplace culture: While 60% of employers said digital transformation was moving too quickly in 2019, that number fell to 45% this year, signaling that businesses are adapting their cultures to drive their digital shift. This is supported by the fact that 77% of talent leaders reported acquiring more digital skill sets to expand their reach and open up business opportunities.\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

For instance, a survey by the Society for Human Resource\nManagement (SHRM) found that 57% of recruiters have talent acquisition\nstrategies that are designed to attract diverse candidates. However, D&I is\nnot only about recruitment. To be able to build a diverse workforce and an\ninclusive culture, organizations need holistic change that they can achieve by\nimplementing proven best practices.\n\nHere are some tips to help organizations achieve diversity and inclusion:\n\n**Establish executive commitment and ownership**  \nHR leaders can always create D&I programs, but without executive support,\nlasting change will not happen. Through the C-suite leadership's commitment,\norganizations can ensure D&I initiatives will rise to the level of priority\nneeded to affect change. Leadership must move the effort forward in the\nfollowing areas:\n\n**Framing the story**  \nNowadays, building a diverse workforce and inclusive culture is a priority\nthat can be linked to business objectives. Does the company's workforce\nreflect its markets' diversity and interests? If not, what does the workforce\nneed to change, and what impact should that change have on the organization's\ncompetitive capability? Since these questions are connected to core business\nperformance, the answers to them are expected to come from C-suite leaders.\n\n**Raising the volume**  \nThere's no question that HR can build awareness for diversity and inclusion\nand enforce policies to improve everything from diverse candidate recruitment\nto employee experience in an inclusive culture.\n\nHowever, only executive leaders can make it personal. They can question\nmanagers on their flexibility for working requirements, succession planning,\nor compensation of diverse employees. They can create and approve the message\nthat will live in communications to employees, investors, or prospective\ncustomers. Ultimately, they can set the goals, ask the questions, and create\nthe mandate needed to spur change.\n\n**Transforming expectations**  \nClear metrics and objectives create results-driven initiatives. Executive\nleadership can be held accountable for achieving change, whether a positive\nresult in a compensation audit across the organization or in the percentage of\ndiverse groups advancing to higher roles over a given timeframe. As executive\nleaders work with HR and lines of business, they can identify objectives, pass\non the vision, and push the activity that will bring change.\n\n**Identify goals and metrics**  \nWhen it comes to diversity and inclusion programs, relevant metrics are the\nkey to ensuring accountability, sustaining and improving activity, and driving\nimpact.\n\n### Most Read\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637214159053363868.jpg)](/asia/specialisation/employment-\nlaw/work-from-home-policy-mom-reveals-penalties/218714)\n\n#### [Work from home policy: MOM reveals\npenalties](/asia/specialisation/employment-law/work-from-home-policy-mom-\nreveals-penalties/218714)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0248_637217526844287040.jpg)](/asia/news/general/singapore-\nannounces-solidarity-budget-amid-covid-19/218966)\n\n#### [Singapore announces 'Solidarity' Budget amid\nCOVID-19](/asia/news/general/singapore-announces-solidarity-budget-amid-\ncovid-19/218966)\n\n[![](https://cdn-\nres.keymedia.com/cms/images/us/039/0223_637213623665490755.jpg)](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-\nwill-penalise-firms-for-weak-measures/218648)\n\n#### [COVID-19: MOM will penalise firms for 'weak'\nmeasures](/asia/news/general/covid-19-mom-will-penalise-firms-for-weak-\nmeasures/218648)\n\nDiversity can be measured through headcount, while inclusion needs more\nfocused attention. The good news is that there's a wealth of data to be\ntracked, and much of that data can help companies identify and address\nemployee experience-related issues. A holistic look at metrics - and the data\nthat can be collected across the employee life cycle - can give an accurate\npicture of where the issues lie.\n\nThe types of data being collected will ultimately determine the D&I strategy's\ndirection. For instance, monitoring the proportion of different nationalities\nin a given market and location and comparing it to the company's employee mix\ncan reveal some gaps. This approach can be brought to all levels and types of\ndiversity, including age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, and religion. Legal\ncounsel's input is crucial when collecting data, as laws vary greatly across\nstates and countries.\n\nWhen armed with a strategy that captures diversity and inclusion data and\ncompares it to relevant thresholds in key areas of recruitment and employee\nexperience, organizations can set measurable goals, according to Allegis\nGroup.\n\n**Build a sense of belonging**  \nA sense of belonging is essential for employees to be able to bring their best\nfoot forward. It's one of the most significant psychological needs that need\nto be met for employees to feel connected with their employer and\norganization.\n\n**Be fair toward all employees**  \nFairness is a prerequisite for employees to feel accepted and valued. Unfair\nsalaries and benefits packages for employees from different backgrounds result\nin unhealthy workplace culture and a lack of diversity.\n\n**Provide equal growth opportunities**  \nOpportunity for growth is one of the main factors that attract and keep talent\nwithin organizations. Thus, employers need to be careful about offering fair\nand equal growth and career advancement opportunities for their employees.\n\n**Uphold innovation and creativity**  \nTo build a diverse workplace, employers must support creativity within their\norganizations. If innovation and creativity are not part of your primary\nbusiness goals, it will be hard to build and maintain workplace diversity.\n\n**Educate employees**  \nFor diversity and inclusion to work in your organization, employees need to\nlearn about the benefits and best practices to support those initiatives. It's\nnot enough for upper-level management to be aware of what D&I means for\nbusiness success and company reputation.\n\n**Advocate teamwork and collaboration**  \nEmployees expect their employers to do so. Thus, to attract and keep a more\ndiverse workforce within your organization, teamwork and collaboration should\nbe part of your main company core values.\n\n**Support flexibility in the workplace**  \nFlexibility is one of the best workplace policies for attracting and retaining\ndiverse employees. A PwC survey found that millennials value company culture\nthat supports work-life balance more than older generations. Meanwhile,\nMcKinsey's research found that a flexible work schedule is the top company\nvalue for women.\n\n**Restructure your hiring process**  \nIn recruitment, focusing on what company candidates worked at or what school\nthey went to can often decrease the candidate pipeline's diversity. However,\nvalid and reliable personality assessments are great tools to measure\ncandidates' personality traits, motivations, and skills. A study of 150\ncompanies found that companies using a [personality\ntest](https://www.hcamag.com/us/specialization/recruitment/personality-\ntest-101-whats-in-it-for-californian-companies/193393) in their hiring\nprocesses had more racially diverse workforces, according to Smarp.\n\nFor more information on the [best practices in workplace diversity and\ninclusion, check out this

Top quality online training courses  \naccessible anywhere, anytime.

Why did you choose to participate in Asia Recruitment Awards?\n\n**BreadTalk Group (BTG):** ARA has a full suite of in-house award categories\nthat covers all aspects of the employee life-cycle. This drives HR\npractitioners who are keen to participate to reflect upon their HR strategies\nto showcase, or to further refine the key areas crucial to their organisation.\n\n**Kerry Taste & Nutrition (Kerry): **Entering ARA was a great experience as it\nmade us reflect upon what we had accomplished internally that led to positive\noutcomes, and it was even better to have that sense of external recognition.\n\n### Q. How was your experience like at\n[#AsiaRecruitmentAwards](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AsiaRecruitmentAwards&src=typed_query&f=live)?\n\n**BTG:** We entered into two award categories in 2019 - Best Employee Branding\nand Most Innovative and Sustainable Office Design. This provided us with the\nopportunity to showcase our people initiative programmes in Singapore and the\nregion.\n\nThe Most Innovative and Sustainable Office Design category was a unique award\ncategory, which provided a glimpse into the design vision our founders and\nsenior management had for BTG IHQ had which aligned with the office\nfacilities.\n\n**Kerry:** It was a really fun night! We invited members of the wider HR team\nto come and enjoy the evening with us, and we were thrilled and proud to have\nreceived the awards.\n\n### Q. How has participating in ARA benefited your company?\n\n**BTG:** Our participation in the ARA has strengthened our conviction to\ncontinuously improve and build on our core HR vision for our employees. This\naward has given us the boost to continue to build on our employer branding\nefforts, to shape BTG as a great place to work in the F&B industry.\n\n**Kerry:** We received lots of exposure and recognition globally! It was a\ngreat boost for progression. We also feel that when we were dealing with\ncandidates day in and day out, this platform caused them to have that extra\nlevel of confidence that we are professional in our approach and it\u2019s great to\nbe able to let them know that we are considered one of the best.\n\n* * *\n\n_It 's time to showcase your recruitment excellence just like these past\nwinners by participating in the [Asia Recruitment Awards 2020,\nSingapore](https://awards.humanresourcesonline.net/asia-recruitment-awards-\nsg/), to be held on 24 April at Sofitel City Centre, Singapore.

Adopt These Cutting-edge Recruitment Software Innovations**\n  * **Choosing Wisely in a Crowded Digital Marketplace**\n\n## **What Is Recruitment Software Technology?**\n\nRecruitment technology is defined as a set of tools used to automate the\nhiring process, connecting with a variety of data sources to access the best\nquality candidates. It performs key functions such as screening applicants,\nstreamlining follow-ups, and providing data on the efficiency of your\nrecruitment model.\n\nOver the last few years, the demand for recruitment software and tools has\nshot up dramatically as the labor market becomes fiercer and more complicated.\nCompanies are eager to hire highly skilled workers and drive business\ninnovation, even as the average tenure per employee continues to dip. In fact,\nglobal market research company Fortune Business Insights finds that the\nrecruitment software market will cross $3,000 million by 2025.\n\nInterestingly, recruitment doesn\u2019t always need to be a technology-driven\nprocess. However, if you\u2019re looking for high-quality talent that makes an\nexcellent culture fit, especially during a rapid growth phase, you will\nrequire recruitment software to achieve the right level of efficiency.\n\nRecruitment software doesn\u2019t just help you complete the formalities around\nhiring a candidate. It automates the entire recruitment pipeline right from\ncandidate sourcing and engagement to the final step of onboarding. That\u2019s why\nit has become a staple for the **[modern HR\ntoolkit](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/hr-\ntoolkit-of-the-future/)**.\n\n## **Four Features of Recruitment Software That Should Be on Your Checklist**\n\nGiven the highly crowded nature of the recruitment software marketplace, how\ndo you go about choosing one best suited to your enterprise? Are you aware of\nall the must-have features in any recruitment platform, and future trends in\nthis space?\n\nHere are a few key features that your recruitment software and tools should be\nable to perform:\n\n### **1\\. Plugging into a variety of data sources**\n\n  \nThe recruitment tool of your choice should be able to **integrate with the\nhighest possible number of data sources** , including social media, email, job\nboards, third-party staffing platforms, and several other **[talent\nsourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-talent-sourcing/)** areas. It should also come with the requisite sort-and-\nfilter capabilities to help find the right talent.\n\n### **2\\. Deploying recruitment marketing initiatives**\n\n  \nToday, attracting and retaining candidates closely resembles the process of\nattracting and retaining consumers. That\u2019s why it is a recruitment best\npractice to **approach the hiring process as a sales and marketing campaign**.\n\nRemember to check if a recruitment software supports email automation, job ads\npublishing, video communication, **[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-relationship-management/)** (CRM), and in-app\nmessaging to engage with applicants across the entire hiring journey.\n\n### **3\\. Shortlisting candidate profiles**\n\n  \nWith so many recommendations and leads flowing in from multiple sources, it\ncould be challenging to arrive at **an actionable list of candidates** \u2013 and\nthis is particularly true for bulk-hiring campaigns.\n\nRecruitment software should be able to build a searchable database of\napplicants, perform level-one resume screening, enable multi-channel\ncommunication within the platform, and aid your end-to-end selection process.\n\n### **4\\. Revealing insights into recruitment efficiency**\n\n  \nThis is one of the most significant advantages of using an analytics-driven\nrecruitment software versus legacy manual processes. The tool should be able\nto gather data across the recruitment pipeline to **extract useful insights,**\nsuch as which sourcing strategy is performing the best, whether your\ntime/cost-to-hire is sustainable, and key pain points in the **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**.\n\nOver time, this feature will ensure your recruitment function becomes smarter,\nmore effective, and ready to stand out in a competitive hiring arena.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve looked at the core features of recruitment software, let's turn\nthe spotlight on some of the most prominent players in this space and a few\ndisruptors that are making game-changing strides in recruitment software\ntechnology.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Candidate Screening and Selection Process: The Complete\nGuide for 2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-screening-and-selection/)\n\n## **The Best Recruitment Software and Tools for 2020**\n\nAs technology evolves in leaps and bounds, powerful software and cutting-edge\ninnovation aren\u2019t limited to large enterprises anymore. For example, Software-\nas-a-Service (SaaS) has made it possible to deploy recruitment tools on a pay-\nper-use model, scaling up or down as necessary. APIs also enable easier\nintegrations without any complex back-end development.\n\nAs a result, our list of the best recruitment software for 2020 is a mix of\nenterprise-grade tools as well as smartly designed products for small and\nmedium-sized businesses (SMBs). We have tried to cover the varying needs of\nbusinesses of multiple sizes, and every software has excellent online customer\nreviews. Remember, the best recruitment software for you will depend on your\nunique business requirements \u2013 that\u2019s why the numbering on this list doesn\u2019t\nreflect the ranking of a particular recruitment tool.\n\n![The best recruitment software to set you up for 2020 and\nbeyond](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1.

My aim was to dig into companies and leaders who embrace a more\ncontemporary approach to human resources. What are they doing that's\ndifferent? How has the leadership profile changed? Is it making a difference?\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nI interviewed more than 30 people leaders around the world for the series and\n[podcast, which I called 21st Century HR](https://21stcenturyhr.com). These\nwere some of the key shifts that differentiate today's HR from legacy\napproaches, and what they mean in 2020:\n\n##  **Inclusion over diversity**\n\nHR has long been focused on the idea of diversity, but these efforts were\noften transactional at best. At worst, they were driven by compliance and\nlargely centered around hiring. \"We need X of Y demographic in our recruiting\npipeline.\" This approach missed the mark and minimized progress.\n\nModern people teams are more focused on inclusion. They understand the\n[bias](https://www.fastcompany.com/90358626/culture-fit-vs-culture-add)\nembedded in terms such as \"culture fit\" and strive to embed inclusive thinking\nand practices throughout their people programs--recruiting, pay equity,\npromotions, training, development. They've moved their approach from\ntransactional programs to embedded practices.\n\n##  **Decentralize and empower over command and control**\n\nLegacy-oriented HR fixated on getting the proverbial seat at the table. To\ngain perceived power, they created command and control structures where HR was\nthe conduit through which approvals flowed. Promotions. Bonuses. Policies. In\nmany cases, this came from a place of insecurity. While it created authority,\nit wasn't without a cost. Resentment swelled at the complex machinations that\nslowed decisions and frustrated employees.\n\nModern HR leaders (and teams) are more secure in the impact they have on the\nbusiness. They see their role as creating frameworks and\n[enablement](https://www.fastcompany.com/90264760/the-best-hr-is-\ninvisible?partner=rss&utm_source=rss&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&utm_content=rss?cid=search)\nprograms that allow leaders to lead and employees to thrive. They don't feel a\nneed to insert themselves into every program and initiative for the sake of\npower and authority.\n\n##  **Agile reviews over annual reviews **\n\nThe annual review cycle has long been seen as HR dogma. It's [a relic of the\npast](https://www.fastcompany.com/90260641/the-complicated-and-troubled-\nhistory-of-the-annual-performance-review) with [no clear\ncorrelation](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190501-why-appraisals-are-\npointless-for-most-people) to employee performance. It's based on a construct\nof long-term employment that no longer exists for many employees. Most\ncompanies treat reviews as little more than a \"check the box\" administrative\nendeavor, feeding the bureaucratic legacy perception of HR.\n\nadvertisement\n\nModern people teams don't run programs for the sake of programs. Their\nprograms need to be anchored in impact to the business. They also understand\nthat a culture of feedback and clarity drives engagement and retention. These\nHR teams are [reimagining](https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/our-journey-\nto-reimagine-performance-reviews-at-surveymonkey/) performance management and\nadopting more agile approaches. The frequency varies--quarterly, monthly, even\nweekly--but the impact is increased clarity and communication.\n\n##  **Analytics and insights over metrics and reporting **\n\nHR has always had data. But it's the way teams interpret and extract insights\nfrom that data that separates legacy and modern HR teams.\n\nPeople analytics is a foundational capability of modern HR. Sixty-nine percent\nof large organizations now have\n[dedicated](https://www.crforum.co.uk/research-and-resources/research-report-\nstrategic-workforce-analytics/) people analytics teams. Leading CHRO's (chief\nhuman resources officers) and chief people officers build agile people\nstrategies based on qualitative and quantitive data. [Data is\nessential](https://www.fastcompany.com/90357244/this-is-why-data-is-now-more-\nessential-than-ever-in-hr) to their operations.\n\n##  **Policy for the many over policy against the few **\n\nLegacy HR approaches are often rooted in compliance. They look at the worst-\ncase scenario of employee behavior and apply the remedy to all employees to\nsafeguard the business.\n\nModern HR leaders aren't shirking their compliance responsibilities, but their\ndefault assumption is that they've hired adults with reasonable judgment who\ncan make good choices. \"If it's not illegal or stupid, it's our job to say\n'yes,'\" Credit Karma chief people officer Colleen McCreary told me on the\npodcast recently. This mentality illustrates the shift in thinking on HR's\nrole in supporting the business. If an employee does something wrong, they\naddress that individually.\n\n##  **Open source over black box**\n\nOne of the single biggest shifts that's fueling next-generation HR practices\nis the shift to [open-source\npractices](https://www.fastcompany.com/3067090/why-hr-needs-to-go-open-\nsource?cid=search). Legacy HR viewed their processes as secret ingredients\nunder lock and key. This proprietary approach stifled innovation.\n\nadvertisement\n\nModern HR teams embrace open-source approaches. You'll often find HR leaders\nspeaking or writing about their work, sharing case studies on their operation\n(including their failures), and sharing openly in networks such as [PeopleTech\nPartners](https://peopletechpartners.com/).\n\nThere's a range of free resources from [Google\nre:Work](https://rework.withgoogle.com/) to [HR Open Source](https://hros.co)\nfull of templates, tools, frameworks, and resources on modern HR practices.\nThis open access to practices and resources is accelerating the shift to\nmodern HR and fueling the next generation of HR leaders.\n\n##  **Business acumen over HR acumen**\n\nEmployment law? Table stakes. Succession planning? A given. Talent mapping?\nFundamental. HR has always had HR acumen. In today's complex business world,\nthat's not enough.\n\nLook across HR leadership in sector-leading companies and you'll HR leaders\nfrom a range of nontraditional career paths. Why? The complexity of business\ntoday requires an HR leader to possess an intimate grasp of the business,\nindustry, market, and more.\n\nThe chief people officer is one of the toughest jobs in the c-suite. They're\nexpected to understand the financials like a CFO. Grasp product-market fit\nlike a CMO. Gauge the revenue pipeline like a CRO. Be the right hand to the\nCEO. All while synthesizing that understanding to develop programs and systems\nthat optimize your most volatile resource: your people. It's a difficult job\neven with business acumen--and it's impossible without it.\n\n## ' **Why isn 't HR here?' over 'Why is HR here?'**\n\nThe key takeaway from these discussions? HR is a spectrum. While the majority\nof the field is somewhere in the middle, the leading edge of HR is having a\ntransformational impact on business. Though still a subset of the broader HR\npopulation, modern people teams are indispensable success enablers for the\nbusiness. Their impact on the business is magnitudes above their legacy\npredecessors.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\n#### About the author\n\nLars Schmidt is the founder of [Amplify](https://amplifytalent.com/), an HR\nexecutive search and consulting firm that helps companies like Hootsuite, NPR,\nand SpaceX navigate the future of work.

Since\nevery organization has unique talent needs that evolve in tandem with business\nstrategies, the ways to manage these talent requirements need to be tailored\nas well.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the 4 steps in choosing the best-fit solution for your business.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze your needs for today and tomorrow**\n\n  \nTo judge whether an HCM software vendor is the right fit for your business\nneeds, you must first analyze what your needs are \u2013 at present and for the\nfuture. Furthermore, it helps to have a need-map of your must-have, good-to-\nhave, and great-to-have needs. Then, match this wishlist of sorts with the\nfeatures and functionalities that any solution offers.\n\n### **Step 2: Assess integration capabilities**\n\n  \nOnce you know what it is that you are looking for in an HCM software, it is\ntime to zone in on your SaaS options. Integrating all HR functions into a\nsingle HCM platform comes with assured cost benefits.\n\nThe task here is to understand which software components need to interact and\nshare data. For example, does your applicant tracking system (ATS) link into\nyour onboarding processes? The right HCM software offering will grow with your\nbusiness, and finding a solution that has the capabilities to integrate myriad\nfunctionalities and to grow is half the battle won.\n\n### **Step 3: Ascertain compliance risks**\n\n  \nWith local and federal regulations in a constant state of flux to incorporate\nand address the evolution of the business ecosystem, it is imperative to\nensure that your processes to manage your human capital are compliant. It\nhelps to stay updated on new laws and amendments, and thus, working with a\nvendor who is ready to evolve with these changes makes a big difference.\n\n### **Step 4: Appraise data security options**\n\n  \nA vendor that ensures data protection and cybersecurity and has a proven\nrecord of being able to manage both areas is a good bet. Since HCM software\nare basically powerhouses of data, strong security procedures need to be\napplied. These procedures also need to evolve with changes in data processes,\ntrends, and privacy policies.\n\nChoosing the right HCM software for your unique business needs is thus\ndependant on how well you understand these needs, the level of market research\nyou conduct to map out the pros and cons of viable options and the goals that\nyou have set for the future.\n\n**_What key features do you look for in your HCM solution?

This proves their customers are\nhappier than ever with their chosen HR management system (HRMS).\n\nCharlotte Brown, Business Operations Manager, commented \"We've had some really\nfantastic feedback from our customers on the improvements to our HR software\nproducts. The enhancements we've made has meant our customers are better able\nto succeed with their people management strategy which is great to hear.\"\n\n\"This year we were also proud to add applicant tracking systems such as\nLinkedIn Talent Hub to our integration portfolio, which already includes G\nSuite, Office 365, Xero and more. With this full suite of integrations, we've\nimproved HR management for our customers throughout the employee lifecycle, as\nwell as enhancing our section on employee performance to provide companies\nwith an innovative way to track individual and team performance.\"\n\nAdditions to their HRMS include creating a review workflow, feedback and\n\"Shout-out\" sections added to their performance management module, providing\ncustomers with the ability to run a seamless employee review process. Other\nadditions include a fully functioning onboarding portal to help customers\nsuccessfully onboard new employees.\n\nThese valuable improvements in the Appogee HR solution are providing customers\nwith a leading advantage in engaging their employees and empowering their\nmanagers. By allowing their customers to enhance their employee experience,\nthey are providing them with a way to retain their top talent providing each\ncustomer with their own distinct competitive advantage.\n\nTheir absence management solution, Appogee Leave, has also seen some valuable\nimprovements. Unlimited PTO is one of the new features now available as an\noption alongside updates to the user experience with new icons making the\nsoftware even easier to use and adopt within organisations.\n\nThe launch of the standalone performance management product Appogee Goals\nproduct in April 2019 marked a significant step forward also. The ability to\nsupport the favourite performance management framework of the Silicon Valley\ntech companies, Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) has propelled Appogee HR's\npeople management expertise. Appogee Goals is also available as part of the\nfull-service HRMS product, Appogee HR Success.\n\nCharlotte also commented excitedly on the future roadmap \"We have so many\nplans for the product too, and we're very keen to be able to keep moving our\nsolutions forward, making them even more beneficial to customers in the\nfuture, so watch this space for even more announcements in 2020!\"\n\nTo

Jerene\nAng\")\n\n## Suite Talk: Why managers shouldn't be afraid to say \"I don\u2019t know\", affirms\nPMI's regional President\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n### While it takes a healthy dose of humility, saying \"I don\u2019t know\" is an\nopportunity to turn to others for answers, insights, knowledge and wisdom,\naffirms Stacey Kennedy _, President, South & Southeast Asia Region, Philip\nMorris International._\n\n### Q How would you describe your journey with Philip Morris International so\nfar? What has been your most memorable moment with the organisation?\n\nIt\u2019s been an extremely challenging and gratifying 24 years with the company.\nFrom day one, I\u2019ve loved the people and the company. I began as a territory\nsales manager, thinking that I would do this for a year or two. Cut to 24\nyears\u2014and many roles\u2014later, I\u2019m still here.\n\nThere have been many, many big moments for me within this company, but the\nmost memorable would have to be the pride I felt when making our announcement\nthat we are transitioning PMI to smoke-free products and leading the charge to\ndesign a smoke-free future for our world. There are millions of legal age\nsmokers who would otherwise continue to smoke who deserve information about\nand access to better alternatives. My job is to get smokers in South and\nSoutheast Asia this information and access. This is quite a change from my job\ndescription a couple of decades ago, and I welcome it.\n\n### Q I understand that you believe a powerful sentence in the workplace is \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know.\u201d Why?\n\nYes, I do, and it\u2019s because we\u2019re taught when we\u2019re in school, and later in\nthe workplace, that we have to have an answer for every question. Especially\nif you\u2019re a manager. A stigma has developed around saying \"I don\u2019t know,\" and\nit\u2019s time to change that and to start to see \"I don\u2019t know\" as an opportunity\nfor us to turn to others for answers, insights, knowledge and wisdom. It takes\na healthy dose of humility, but that\u2019s how we make ourselves, our colleagues\nand our companies smarter and stronger \u2014 what we don\u2019t know is what we need to\nlearn.\n\n### Q Having worked across the US, Europe, and Asia, what differences do you\nobserve in each region - in terms of talent as well as the pace of change and\ntransformation?\n\nThe entrepreneurial spirit and rate and pace of change in Indonesia, India,\nVietnam and many of the markets where I work today, and particularly in\ndigital and tech economies, is pretty phenomenal. It\u2019s much more obvious than\neven in Europe or more developed countries because, there, it\u2019s in the\nbackground. We know the rate of change the world over, but it\u2019s not so in your\nface every day. That\u2019s really unique to Asia. The other thing I\u2019ve noticed\nabout Asia is that the speed to market is amazing. It shows the absolute\nhunger of entrepreneurs in Asia to be able to bring new products to market.\n\n### Q You were appointed to a VP role when you were just 32, making you the\nyoungest VP ever appointed at Philip Morris. What was your secret to success?\n\nI think my \u201csecret\u201d is my natural tendency to be a searcher and to push\nboundaries outwards, as opposed to retreating inwards. I have a natural\ncuriosity that drives me to engage in conversations with others around this\nbusiness, rather than retreating into my own bunker. That\u2019s been a\ndifferentiator.\n\nI would also say I\u2019ve benefited from thinking in what I call \u201cstrategy mode.\u201d\nOften human nature is to think very incrementally. We\u2019re always trying to get\nat what is the smartest way to get to from point A to point B. But what I\u2019m\nalways looking for is a quantum leap. Is there a completely different way\u2014not\nto hop from letter to letter to letter to get from A to Z, but to make one\nmassive leap forward?\n\n### Q Being the first-ever female President of Asia Pacific operations for\nPhilip Morris International, and a mother of twin daughters, what career\nadvice do you have for young women looking to climb the career ladder?\n\nI think women, and all people, can upskill themselves tremendously by just\nengaging in conversation. Lessons can come from anywhere and anyone. There are\nalways new people to meet and new cultures to understand\u2014and that\u2019s\ninformation you can take with you and allow to inform your path in life.\n\nAs for balancing a career and motherhood, what I\u2019ve found most helpful is to\ntake down the walls between the two. I try to take my daughters along with me\non as many business trips as I can, and I often talk to them about work. If\nthey know I have a big presentation the next day, for instance, we\u2019ll even\nrole play where they\u2019re firing questions at me. They like to get in my\nbusiness and understand what it is I\u2019m trying to accomplish, and I love that.\nI think it\u2019s important for our kids to know what their parents do and what\ncontributions we\u2019re making. Most adults need to work to earn an income, and\nkids can understand this. But more importantly, positioning work as fulfilment\nis key to role model for children. \u201cIf you do what you love, you\u2019ll always\nlove what you do.\u201d\n\n### Q What do you think organisations can do to empower more women leaders\nlike yourself?\n\nIt\u2019s the responsibility of an organisation to consider how to create an\nenvironment that is conducive for each member of the team to bring his or her\nbest self to work. For too long, women in leadership have felt the need to\nblend in with what can often be a very homogenous group of male peers and\nsuperiors. I tried to play it that way at first myself, to pretend I was one\nof the gang, but that was absolutely the wrong mentality. That was a huge\nlearning insight for me because by trying to fit in, the company didn\u2019t derive\nthe full value of my differences.\n\nI take accountability for part of that myself because I think that each and\nevery one of us has to ask ourselves, \u201cAm I being my best authentic self? How\nam I bringing my best self to this team and to my work?\u201d But it also goes both\nways; organisations should be inviting and encouraging their female employees\nto be authentically themselves and to be in conversation about their different\nperspectives.\n\nThe more that a company can turn those insights from conversation into\nactions, the better off they are because then they can actually change and\nderive more value from their employees\u2019 differences. And that\u2019s true of gender\ndifferences, background differences, even different strengths of intellectual\nand emotional capability.\n\nI also think organisations need to know the business case for diversity \u2014 to\nsee that focusing on gender diversity and inclusion creates a more sustainable\nbusiness and allows companies to derive their employees\u2019 full value, and is\nworth investing in. For example, we put in a lot of work to ensure PMI\u2019s\nrecent global EQUAL-SALARY certification\u2014we are the first multinational to\nearn the certification. It's been a very exciting time of growth and\ndevelopment for us, and it\u2019s signaled all our commitment to all of our\nemployees.\n\n### Q What is your view of human resources as a business function? How closely\ndo you work with your HR head and on what kind of issues?\n\nThe partnership between HR and general management is critical. The pace of\nchange within the HR function is tremendous as it is in business, and today\nmore than ever, the critical skill sets in modern HR are very specialised, and\nwe need specialisation more than generalists.\n\nI have always believed that line management should be ultimately accountable\nfor the caliber and performance of the organisation, and that can only happen\nwith increasing effectiveness and efficiency of specialised skills in talent\nacquisition, retention, organisation design, OGSM (objectives, goals,\nstrategies and measures) performance management systems, leadership and skill\ndevelopment, increasing digitalisation of our HR systems and learning\nprograms, and much more.\n\n### Q Describe your ideal CHRO.\n\nI think one of the things that is desperately needed from all leaders, but\nperhaps for a CHRO in particular, is the ability to truly listen and to engage\nmore in the business. HR exists to support building the highest performance\nemployee team the business can afford, and those employees will serve\nconsumers \u2013 so the ideal CHRO knows what our consumer needs and journey are\nand how employees can best serve them.\n\n### Q If not this career, what alternative career path might you have chosen?\n\nI have no idea how realistic it would be, but on my short list of \"alternative\ncareers\" would be: international food critic and columnist, National\nGeographic photographer, and non-fiction author.\n\n_Photo / provided_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

more than 80% of HR and IT leaders are concerned\nabout user adoption of new tech solutions.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | February 20,

their checkbooks in 2020 for HR\ntechnology, according to a new survey that reports seven out of 10 companies\nplan to boost spending on HR tech this year.\n\nThe new PwC global [survey](https://www.pwc.com/hrtechsurvey.html) of 600 HR\nand IT leaders found that the projected financial investment is designed to\naddress human capital challenges that keep rising on CEOs' agendas, including\nrecruiting, staff development and workforce expectations about technology. On\nthe other hand, adoption challenges related to these investments remain a\nserious barrier, cited by 82% of respondents.\n\nDan Staley, global HR technology leader at PwC, explains that, while the\nC-suite is optimistic about the value of new technology, eight in 10 users\nstruggle with adoption challenges; additionally, the C-suite is twice as\nlikely as managers to say these tools are actually effective.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\u201cAlthough the rising number of companies with core HR technologies in the\ncloud are likely to report increased productivity, improved employee\nexperience and better workforce insights,\u201d Staley says, \u201cthere\u2019s more work to\ndo to enable and motivate people to commit to using these tools to change the\nways they work and develop in their careers.\u201d\n\n**Related:[Do you know how to drive HR-tech adoption?\n](https://hrexecutive.com/do-you-know-how-to-drive-hr-tech-adoption/)**\n\nTo address this disconnect and increase the effectiveness of these portfolios\nfor all, Staley says, it's smart to start with the basics, including:\n\n  * Answer the right questions. Get the right people in the room to determine the business problem to solve, and engage front-line employees to solve it. This will allow for better matching of technologies with needs.\n  * Increase the use of adoption techniques, such as gamification and incentives, to encourage the workforce to learn and make new tech part of their day-to-day routines.\n  * Get feedback during and after the implementation of new technology. Provide mechanisms for employees to offer suggestions on what is working and not working so that applications can be improved upon.\n\nAnother area of concern in the survey? About 80% of companies plan to\nimplement [artificial intelligence](https://hrexecutive.com/hr-tech-2019-hr-\nin-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence/) for their HR organizations over the\nnext two years. As of today, however, 63% of companies have not yet\nimplemented done so, primarily because they have not yet zeroed in on the\nright use case.\n\n\u201cIt is important for organizations to identify the business problem before\njumping straight to a technology solution,\u201d Staley says.\n\nThe PwC research surfaced six main issues driving HR-tech expansion in 2020:\n\n  * Finding, attracting and retaining talent (58%)\n  * Developing people to reach their full potential (43%)\n  * Improving the [employee experience](https://hrexecutive.com/this-is-why-you-have-to-take-employee-experience-seriously/) (42%)\n  * Creating a collaborative work environment (40%)\n  * Workforce planning (38%)\n  * Ensuring wellbeing, inclusion and diversity (34%)\n\n\u201cUpdating the candidate and employee experience is especially important for\ncompanies trying to fill critical talent gaps,\u201d Staley says. \u201cEmployers know\nthat job seekers, particularly in high-demand fields, will turn down offers\ndue to bad recruiting experiences, and they can\u2019t take that chance.\u201d\n\nTom Starner is a freelance writer based in Philadelphia who has been covering\nthe human resource space and all of its component processes for over two\ndecades.

As the\nname suggests, ATS enables automated applicant tracking and can store and\nprocess vast volumes of data. With features such as interview scheduling,\nassessment generation, and comparison, message distribution, universal search,\nand customized import and export of data, applicant tracking systems aid in\nscreening, shortlisting, and communicating with candidates.\n\nATS options are available for businesses across the board, be it for\nenterprise, midsize, or small business requirements. Moreover, based on\nspecific business needs, organizations can also choose various formats of\ndeployment.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you need to purchase an ATS solution for a midsize\ncorporation with an employee strength of 800 (spread across three regions) \u2013\nwhich you wish to double over the next year. There was a time when you could\nnot find a customized solution specific to your needs, budget, and growth\nplans. So you would have had to go for a typical one-size-fits-all option.\nNow, however, organizations are spoilt for choice in a market that offers\nmultiple options for the most specific combination of needs.\n\nWhile most **[human capital management\n(HCM)](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-human-capital-management/)** suites do offer the sub-functionality\nof an applicant tracking system, there are also several point solutions that\nspecialize only in ATS. The challenge now is not hunting for a specialized,\ncustomizable solution but rather choosing the solution that is the best fit\nout of the many that are available.\n\nThe pie chart below depicts the market share enjoyed by the twenty most\nprevalent ATS software. We will focus on the top10 ATS solutions for 2020 in\nno particular order. Since there is no one-size-fits-all mantra for choosing\nan ATS, there is no \u201ctop\u201d or \u201cbest\u201d solution that would work across the board.\nThe key is to identify your own requirements of an ATS and then choose a\nsolution that can be suited to each unique need of your organization.\n\n![Market share of ATS solutions](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1.

What drove you to return?\n\nSince stepping down in 2013, the restaurant sector - especially in casual\ndining - has been faced with tremendous competition and a huge decline in\ndomestic consumption. While we continued to be Singapore's largest casual\ndining restaurant chain, even our highest performing brands like ThaiExpress,\nPoulet, and Xin Wang Hong Kong Caf\u00e9 were not immune to these unfavourable\neconomic conditions.\n\nHaving played a major part in the founding of many of Minor Food Singapore's\n(MFS) brands, I really felt a sense of duty to navigate the company through\nthis difficult time. As a firm believer that food should be uncomplicated,\nwe've since kept our offerings simple by bringing in timeless, affordable\nclassics like Thailand\u2019s Go-Ang Chicken Rice as well as collaborated with\ncelebrity chefs to perfect our existing menus and win back the hearts of our\ncustomers.\n\n### Q To turn the business around, you had to trim headcount and close eight\nstores. Would you consider this one of the toughest decisions that you have\nhad to make? What did you learn from it?\n\nSurprisingly, the closure of eight stores was not the toughest decision to\nmake. What was most challenging was having to decrease our headcount because\nof this. From decades of working in F&B and navigating through countless\nsetbacks, I\u2019ve learned that in difficult times what gets you through is the\nquality of people. This is what enables a brand to prevail. I\u2019m very proud to\nsay that we\u2019ve come a long way, and having the right people policies to\nattract and retain talent has been a crucial factor in turning around our\nbusiness.\n\n### Q In the F&B industry, talent attraction and retention are major\nchallenges. One way to ensure employees stay for the long run is through\nempowering them. How is this done at Minor Food Singapore?\n\nRegardless of their job titles \u2013 be it in management, kitchen or service roles\n\u2013 we strongly believe in fostering a greater sense of belonging by empowering\nour people to play a bigger part in making business decisions. They will be\nassessed by their direct superiors who\u2019ll monitor their progress and assign\nnew or greater responsibilities to those who are capable enough to take on the\ntask. As they rise to these challenges with consistently outstanding\nperformance, we go as far as to give our people full control of the kitchen\noperation, menu planning and pricing of one or more of our F&B brands. To\nfurther sweeten the deal for high performers, we also have a profit share\nscheme to cultivate an even stronger sense of ownership of the business, and\nmotivation to see the business succeed.\n\n### Q Through empowering your staff, apart from retention, have you seen\nsuccesses in other areas such as behavioural changes, productivity, customer\nsatisfaction, and percentage growth?\n\nDe\ufb01nitely. The purpose of empowering our people is to ensure that they become\nmore engaged and vocal with their views to how MFS\u2019s business is run. After\nall, our people are our greatest resource. For example, some of our brand\noperations meetings have extended from the usual two hours to up to four\nhours, as team members become more vocal and everyone feels a sense of\nresponsibility to provide feedback, ideas and plans. This empowerment comes\nfrom a place of genuine interest to help the business do better, which is\ncrucial to helping the management team fully understand the situation on the\nground.\n\nAnd although long meetings may not sound productive, through these we have\nmanaged to solve both long-running and teething operational issues, which is\ncrucial to long-term success.\n\n### Q Today, there is a lot of focus on having an entrepreneurial mindset.\nHaving co-founded ThaiExpress in 2002, how would you describe such a mindset?\n\nBeing an F&B entrepreneur today means having the tenacity to compete in a\nhighly saturated market where consumer preferences are constantly changing. In\norder to stay ahead of these shifts, there are three qualities that are key to\nforming an entrepreneurial mindset:\n\n  * **The ability to act fast** \u2013 Being able to make decisions quickly means that you\u2019ll be able to deliver results sooner. Regardless if the outcome is good or bad, the business will also then be able to respond more definitively in terms of next steps.\n  * **Take calculated risks** \u2013 There is never a 'winning formula' to doing business, which is why entrepreneurs often find themselves in positions in which they\u2019ll have to take risks. If not, the opportunity costs may be even bigger. For instance, when selecting a potential site for one of our restaurants we have to take a calculated risk, even though we may not have full clarity on visitor numbers. If we\u2019re too cautious about jumping on these opportunities, the site can easily end up in the hands of a competitor brand instead.\n  * **Believing in your people** \u2013 No entrepreneur is a one-man show, every business must operate as a team. Without trusting that you have the right people and an effective team, your business will not be poised to succeed.\n\n### Q Can such an entrepreneurial mindset be inculcated? If so, how can HR\ninculcate this mindset in employees?\n\nI believe that an entrepreneurial mindset is something that needs to be\ncultivated in time by learning from your own past successes and failures, as\nwell as those of the people around you. This mindset did not come naturally to\nme as a young chef until I started to refine my business acumen through trial\nand error and on-the-job practice much later in my professional career. The\nbest thing a company can do to encourage this entrepreneurial mindset is\nprovide them with good role models they can learn business skills from. Also,\ngive them ample opportunities to come forward with ideas and suggestions, as\nwell as a safe space to take risks and make mistakes.\n\n### Q There has been much talk about companies embracing technology and change\nto drive employee performance. What is your view on this?\n\nWhile there are merits to what technology can do, I\u2019m a firm believer in\nkeeping our operations simple to improve employee productivity instead. By\nadopting technology only where necessary - such as self-ordering menus - we\nensure our brands stay true to their roots. In an F&B environment where food\nfads come and go, our focus on classic concepts that have stood the test of\ntime have been a testament to how our customers expect good food and good\nservice, but are less concerned with the theatrics that come with technology.\n\n### Q What is your view of human resources as a business function? How closely\ndo you work with your HR head and on what kind of issues?\n\nMFS can only be as strong as the people behind our brands, especially since we\noperate in a highly manpower intensive industry. With over 13 concepts under\nour F&B portfolio, having the right talent who genuinely believe in what we do\nto delight our customers has been crucial to our business success. That is why\nI work very closely with, Chan Peiling, our HR director on all people policies\nranging from recruitment, benefits, career progression, retention and more.\nAlongside my HR team, I also personally play an active role in talent\nacquisition with candidates across all business, kitchen and service functions\nto ensure that they are a good cultural fit.\n\n### Q If your HR head had to take over your position tomorrow, do you think\nshe will be successful? Why?\n\nWhile realistically there may still be some gaps in knowledge for our HR\ndirector to assume the role of CEO, I am confident that Peiling would be\nprepared to step up to the occasion. Given the strategic nature of her job,\nshe works closely with various departments and brands across the organisation.\nIt is with this working relationship that she has been exposed broadly to the\ninner workings of the business, whether it is from a manpower, operational or\nrevenue point of view.\n\n_Photo / provided_\n\nLearn at your own convenience with [Uniqskills\nAsia](https://www.uniqskills.asia/).

Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual! New courses, new formats!  \n[Review the 2020 masterclasses here\n\u00bb](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\n### _While the Asian culture is more command and control, top-down driven; in\nthe US and Europe, people are vocal and usually have a point of view._ Sara\nCheng _, CEO, Fuji Xerox Singapore, explains how she has navigated her various\ngeographic experiences as a leader, in this chat with_ Jerene Ang _._\n\n_Vital Stats: As CEO of Fuji Xerox Singapore, Sara Cheng is responsible for\nthe company\u2019s overall strategic growth and further strengthening its customer\ncommitment, digital transformation, and employee engagement. She brings with\nher 25 years of experience in general management, business development and\nconsulting with Xerox, IBM, Teradata, NCR and Procter & Gamble across US,\nEurope, and Asia Pacific._\n\n### Q Having worked with big tech firms such as Teradata, NCR, and IBM, prior\nto Fuji Xerox, tell us why you\u2019re so passionate about this sector.\n\nThe two traits that appeal to me are the speed of change and the constant\nrefresh of the industry. The infinite possibilities of the technology sector\nsatisfy my curiosity and hunger for knowledge. Regardless of which sector I am\nin, I am humbled to have the opportunity to be in positions that allow\ncreativity, room for growth and opportunities to develop high-performance\nteams.\n\nIt has been one-and-a-half years for me at Fuji Xerox Singapore and I\u2019m\nexcited by what has been accomplished by the team thus far, and what is ahead\nof us.\n\n### Q With significant accomplishments to your name \u2013 achieving the highest\nemployee satisfaction, winning global clients\u2019 contracts, establishing a\nstart-up business in a saturated market \u2013 what are your success factors?\n\nI would say that building a future-ready team is an important attribute. There\nare a few characteristics for this: self-awareness, out-of-box thinking,\nability to detect and solve problems, emotional intelligence, and agility.\n\n### Q How has your experience varied working across Asia, the US and Europe?\n\nI grew up in Taiwan until I graduated from university. Upon graduation with an\nMBA degree, I worked in the US for 10 years. Thereafter, I worked in Amsterdam\nfor five years before the move to Singapore 15 years ago.\n\nIn general, the Asian culture is more command and control, top-down driven.\nPeople respect hierarchy and follow orders well. In the US and Europe, people\nare vocal and usually have a point of view on issues and approaches. People\nquestion \u201cwhy?\u201d, and equally, \u201cwhy not?\u201d, more.\n\nIn addition to embracing the strengths from different cultures at Fuji Xerox,\nmy aim is also to develop curiosity in our people, and an organisation that\nbelieves in lifelong learning.\n\nWe promote and operate in a coaching-based team-centric environment with\nlargely flexible chains of command. Employees are encouraged to be change\nagents and make an impact by thinking out of the box, bringing new ideas to\nthe table, and developing preventative measures.\n\n> ##### Fuji Xerox has been the market leader for the past 30 years. Our past\n> successes, sometimes, have become the obstacles to change.\n\n### Q As CEO, what is your most satisfying talent milestone in the past couple\nof years?\n\nFuji Xerox has been the market leader for the past 30 years. Our past\nsuccesses, sometimes, have become the obstacles to change. In managing change,\nwe have made people and talent development centre stage, as we believe the\nsuccess of digital transformation is dependent on human transformation.\n\nIn the past 18 months, I am most proud about how much we, as an organisation,\nhave changed and how open and receptive our people have been to change.\n\nFuji Xerox conducts an employee engagement survey annually. After the\norganisation went through a period where about 75% of the top-level leaders\nchanged, we expected the employee engagement level to fall significantly. To\nour pleasant surprise, the results only dropped by two points.\n\nIt was reassuring to know the initiatives to manage the transition were well-\nreceived with the full understanding of our people.\n\n### Q How closely do you work with your HR leader on initiatives for\nemployees?\n\nMy HR leader plays the most critical role. We work very closely on our change\nmanagement programme, which includes a multi-layered formal and informal grid\nto reach as many people as possible so that change can take effect swiftly.\n\nI hold weekly meetings with all senior leaders to align our objectives and\nactions across departments. Messages are then cascaded via platforms to\nprovide clarity across the board. At the management level, we have a managers\u2019\nevent to encourage two-way communications, while town hall sessions are held\nevery few months with all employees.\n\nI also write letters to the entire employee base through the in-house\nnewsletter.\n\n_Photo / Provided_\n\nHuman Resources magazine and the HR Bulletin daily email newsletter:  \nAsia's only regional HR print and digital media

Available to OnPay customers and accounting\npartners at no extra charge, the new HR tools provide everything a business\nneeds to stay compliant with HR requirements and best practices. OnPay also\nautomates time-consuming, repetitive tasks and offers customizable personnel\nchecklists to keep businesses organized. The new suite underscores the\ncompany\u2019s ongoing mission to set a higher standard in payroll services.  \n\nAccording to the [_2019 Small Business Finance and HR\nReport_](http://payrollcenter.com/onpay/2019-small-business-finance-\nHR?channel=survey-press-release)* from OnPay, small business owners spend\nroughly 40 hours a month on HR and payroll. While 86 percent are confident\nthat their HR practices are compliant with state and federal regulations, a\nmajority are not confident that they are handling specific HR-related tasks\nwell. Maintaining records, properly categorizing employees and contractors,\nand having up-to-date employee handbooks are all practices that less than 50\npercent of business owners are confident they are performing correctly.\n\nThe full-service HR suite from OnPay helps small businesses get human\nresources right by offering:\n\n  * Online onboarding, including the auto-generation and electronic signing of employee offer letters, tax forms and all personal information. No printers or data entry are required. Admins simply put in the employee\u2019s name, email address, and offer details. OnPay takes it from there.\n  * Customizable personnel checklists that track important HR processes such as incident reporting and onboarding. Employers create a checklist of tasks and documents that need to be completed. Then employees are asked to electronically sign any documents and tasks (like IT setup or orientation) are assigned to responsible teammates.\n  * Paid time off accruals and approvals. OnPay lets employees accrue PTO at up to three different rates, depending on employee type or seniority. Employees request time off within OnPay, then managers are notified and asked to approve. OnPay also creates a calendar detailing upcoming PTO.\n  * E-signable legal document templates and a complete library of free HR guides and resources.\n  * Automatically-generated org charts and employee directories with pictures and contact information.\n  * Lifetime employee accounts, so employees can access their own pay stubs, tax forms, and employment documents, even if they are no longer with the company.\n  * In-app messaging and secure document storage to keep business owners organized and create an HR paper trail.\n  * Later this summer, the suite will include HR audits based upon the personnel checklists employers set up. OnPay will monitor whether tasks and documents have been completed and alert admins when employees are out of compliance. This feature will make it easy to identify HR issues, including when employees need to sign the most current versions of documents like employee handbooks. \n\n\u201cLess than 40 percent of the small businesses we talk to have one or more\nemployees who are dedicated full-time to HR,\u201d says Mark McKee, president and\nCOO of OnPay. \u201cOur latest offering adds a built-in HR department to our\npayroll services. It gives small businesses without an HR team the resources\nthey need to handle HR confidently, and it makes any in-house HR specialist\nmuch more efficient in larger companies. It\u2019s something every employer needs,\nso we\u2019re offering it at no additional cost to our clients.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition to payroll, OnPay keeps adding new HR features that make my life\neasier. For example, PTO requests, approvals and tracking are right in the\napp. It's a streamlined process and a fantastic platform,\u201d says Annie Eaton,\nCEO of Futurus.\n\nThe HR suite of services is now available to a select set of OnPay clients,\nand will be rolled out to all clients at no extra cost over the next few\nmonths.

](https://www.contxto.com/en/)-\n[Runa](https://database.contxto.com/company/Runa), the HR startup from Mexico,\nhas been busy as of late. In correspondence with Contxto, it shared that it\u2019s\nadded two new perks to its platform. One applies to employee enrollment in\nMexico\u2019s healthcare system and the other is a performance management feature.\n\nThe startup can be found in Mexico City and Guadalajara, but more recently\nit\u2019s also opened offices in Monterrey.\n\nThrough this expansion, [Runa](https://database.contxto.com/company/Runa) is\nnow well-positioned in the country\u2019s key business and tech hubs. And it's also\ngood news for people looking for great employment. This is so given it was\npreviously featured in LinkedIn's ranking of best startups to work for.\n\n _Related article:_[ _LinkedIn\u2019s Top 10 startups to work for: Mexico and\nBrazil_](https://www.contxto.com/en/startups/linkedins-top-10-startups-to-\nwork-for-mexico-and-\nbrazil/?nab=1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F)\n\n### HR startup and its on the rise platform\n\nLike many startups we\u2019ve previously covered,\n[Runa](https://database.contxto.com/company/Runa) emerged as an answer to a\nrecurring problem. In this case for payroll management in Mexico.\n\nSpecifically, the startup\u2019s founder, Courtney McColgan, was surprised with\nwhat a bumpy process it is to release payroll. And it often results in\nstressed-out employees and headaches for HR.\n\nAs a result, McColgan put her Silicon Valley-honed skills to the test and\nfounded [Runa](https://database.contxto.com/company/Runa) in 2017.\n\nThrough the platform, HR staff have more control over payroll including\nsettlement packages for employees.\n\nAnd as the startup has grown, it\u2019s also expanded its offering of features like\ntracking vacation days, employee performance, among others.\n\nThe startup\u2019s platform is leased to companies based on the number of employees\nor the features the business is interested in using.\n\nMcColgan previously worked as an Executive at Cabify and even worked for\nventure capital (VC) funds such as Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Morgenthaler\nVentures.\n\nThe startup for its part has gone through Y Combinator\u2019s accelerator program\nand raised funding from the likes of Salesforce Ventures and Maschmeyer Group\nVentures.\n\n _Related article:_[ _11 startups from Santiago lightening the load for\nHR_](https://www.contxto.com/en/market-map/11-startups-santiago-lightening-\nload-hr/)\n\n### HR featuritis?\n\nA little while back we released a market map covering HR startups from\nSantiago, Chile.\n\nAnd it was striking to see the number of full-suite end-to-end solutions out\nthere for Human Resources. Platforms with recruitment features, work\nenvironment metrics, add-ons for employee exits.\n\nIt was concerning that some may have even fallen into excessive feature\nofferings, aka \u201cfeaturitis.\u201d\n\nWanting to get a better grasp on how startups find a healthy balance between\nthe quantity and quality of features it offers, I reached out to\n[Runa](https://database.contxto.com/company/Runa).\n\nFor this startup, finding the sweet spot between the number of perks and the\neffectiveness they provide is a matter of being in contact with customers.\n\n\u201cThe secret is in listening to the customer,\u201d the startup explained in recent\ncorrespondence, \u201cit\u2019s something we do through our platform. There we provide\nreal-time consulting, we answer questions, and we learn about the features\nthat really make a difference for them.\u201d\n\nSo there you have it folks, customers have a unique perspective to offer. So\nkeep those communication channels open.\n\n _Related articles:_[ _Tech and startups in\nMexico!_](https://www.contxto.com/en/category/mexico/)\n\n-ML\n\n  * Tags\n  * [human resources](https://www.contxto.com/en/tag/human-resources/)\n  * [mexico](https://www.contxto.com/en/tag/mexico/)\n  * [news](https://www.contxto.com/en/tag/news/)\n  * [saas](https://www.contxto.com/en/tag/saas/)\n  * [startup](https://www.contxto.com/en/tag/startup/)\n\n[ __Facebook\n](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.contxto.com%2Fen%2Fmexico%2Fmexicos-\nhr-startup-runa-unleashes-more-features-platform%2F)[__Twitter\n](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Mexico%E2%80%99s+HR+startup+Runa+unleashes+more+features+for+its+platform&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.contxto.com%2Fen%2Fmexico%2Fmexicos-\nhr-startup-runa-unleashes-more-features-platform%2F&via=contxto_)[__Linkedin\n](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.contxto.com/en/mexico/mexicos-\nhr-startup-runa-unleashes-more-features-\nplatform/&title=Mexico%E2%80%99s+HR+startup+Runa+unleashes+more+features+for+its+platform)[__WhatsApp\n](whatsapp://send?text=Mexico%E2%80%99s+HR+startup+Runa+unleashes+more+features+for+its+platform\n%0A%0A https://www.contxto.com/en/mexico/mexicos-hr-startup-runa-unleashes-\nmore-features-platform/)[__Email ](mailto:?subject=Mexico\u2019s HR startup Runa\nunleashes more features for its\nplatform&body=https://www.contxto.com/en/mexico/mexicos-hr-startup-runa-\nunleashes-more-features-platform/)\n\n__\n\nPrevious article[Colombian, Rebus Technology raises, US$415,000 investment for\nevent algorithm](https://www.contxto.com/en/colombia/colombian-rebus-\ntechnology-raises-us415k-investment-event-algorithm/)\n\nNext article[Brazil's Sapore acquires foodtech startups Lucco Fit, Shipp, and\nZaitt](https://www.contxto.com/en/brazil/brazil-sapore-acquires-foodtech-\nstartups-lucco-fit-shipp-zaitt/)\n\n[![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2096%2096'%3E%3C/svg%3E)![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/23ceae24f17add96624b220516579003?s=96&d=mm&r=g)](https://www.contxto.com/en/author/mariana-\nlopez/)\n\n[Mariana L\u00f3pez](https://www.contxto.com/en/author/mariana-lopez/)[]()\n\nEager learner and fervent asker of existential questions.

Opinions\nexpressed are those of the author.\n\n| Paid Program\n\n[Leadership](/leadership)\n\nPOST WRITTEN BY\n\nRegina W. Romeo\n\nChief HR Officer of [CPS HR Consulting](http://www.cpshr.us/), HR expert\nwitness and host of the \u201cOffice Politics Radio\u201d podcast with over 20 years of\nHR experience\n\n  * Share to Facebook\n  * Share to Twitter\n  * Share to Linkedin\n\nIn response to widespread financial mismanagement in the federal government,\nin 1990, George W. Bush signed the [Chief Financial Officers (CFO)\nAct](https://www.encyclopedia.com/finance/finance-and-accounting-\nmagazines/chief-financial-officers-act-1990-and-federal-financial-management-\nact-1994). The purpose of the Act was to create a chief financial officer role\nin over 20 federal departments and agencies. The CFO's role, in part, was to\nprovide \"tight financial control over agency operations and the central\ncoordination of financial management functions to support an efficient\nadministration of the executive branch.\" This was a departure from strictly\nday-to-day accounting and financial reports. It required CFOs to function at a\nmore strategic and forward-thinking level. Director of finance, controller,\nfiscal officer, etc. are titles we no longer use. Just as the role of the CFO\nhas evolved from bookkeeping and number crunching, the role of the director of\nHR has also evolved.\n\nThe C-suite in most organizations consists of the CEO, CFO, CIO and/or COO,\nwhile HR has mostly had a D-level or director designation. Historically, when\nit came to HR professionals, the edict was to \"fight for a seat at the table\"\nor \"prove your worth\" when it came to reporting directly to the CEO. HR is\nstill widely viewed as a strictly transactional processing center filled with\npaper pushers who only exist to say \"no\" to everything. This outdated thinking\nholds many organizations back. You can read any business publication for\ncountless examples of organizations that don't have HR represented in their\nC-suite and the trouble and challenges they encounter as a result. Often, HR\nis only included after something goes awry or requires some cleanup, even\nthough experience tells us that is not optimal.\n\nModern HR is much more than transactions and processing, yet the title is\ngenerally still \"director of HR,\" and the person usually doesn't report to the\nCEO. Now, more than ever, organizations require HR to set the tone for good\nworkplace culture, excellent employee experiences, high retention, succession\nplanning, change management and other business objectives. Directors of HR\nreceive directives and information from a COO, deputy director or another\nexecutive who doesn't necessarily have an HR background. Their connection to\nthe C-suite can be several levels removed. This is where a chief human\nresources officer role enters.\n\nA chief is also a strategist and business partner that operates at the\nexecutive level and reports directly to the CEO. As human resources leader\nJulia Modise [wrote](https://www.spencerstuart.com/leadership-\nmatters/2018/november/changing-role-of-the-chief-human-resources-officer),\n\"The profile of a CHRO has shifted from a traditional HR professional narrowly\nfocused on his/her function to a well-rounded business leader who can\ncontribute meaningfully in all areas of the business. Today's CHRO is a\nculture carrier and change agent who is commercially astute, analytical and\ntechnologically savvy, who speaks truth to power and influences softly yet\nassertively.\" With an increased focus on issues around pay equity, diversity\nand inclusion efforts, workplace harassment and bullying, the CHRO's voice and\nperspective are critical in executive-level decisions. Other non-HR executives\nwill filter issues that affect the people side of your business through a\ndifferent lens, which could easily include blind spots when determining the\nimpact to your employees. Reading the laws and statutes that govern what goes\non in the workplace can easily be done. However, understanding the subtleties\nand nuances of good human resources management is something best left to your\nCHRO.\n\nThe CHRO has their finger on the pulse of the organization and is therefore\nable to predict and recognize emerging trends and situations that are\ndeveloping within the workforce and be the liaison between the CEO and the\nworkforce. Your CHRO will ask questions and give input at the beginning of the\nplanning process instead of coming in after the fact or when a decision has\nalready been made. The CHRO brings a different viewpoint and is not strictly\nlooking at facilities, hard numbers or black-and-white outcomes, but also\nconsiders the impact to the employees, which ultimately affects employee\nengagement, retention and other organizational concerns.\n\nThere is still a stigma when HR is involved in a situation or they join a\nmeeting because people think either someone is in trouble or something went\nwrong. As an HR professional of over 20 years, I am often greeted with \"I\ndidn\u2019t do anything\" or \"What's wrong?\" when I walk into a room. It's vital for\nthe CHRO to be a visible and vocal part of the executive team in general daily\noperations and not just when things aren't going well. Showing unity at the\nexecutive level sets a great example and fosters an environment where everyone\nin the organization understands there is teamwork and cohesion from the top\ndown.\n\nIn an [article](https://hbr.org/2015/07/people-before-strategy-a-new-role-for-\nthe-chro) for the _Harvard Business Review_ , Ram Charan, Dominic Barton and\nDennis Carey assert that \"to make the CHRO a true partner, the CEO should\ncreate a triumvirate at the top of the corporation that includes both the CFO\nand the CHRO. Forming such a team is the single best way to link financial\nnumbers with the people who produce them. It also signals to the organization\nthat you are lifting HR into the inner sanctum and that the CHRO's\ncontribution will be analogous to the CFO's.\"\n\nThe C-suite is for collaborative strategy development to determine where your\norganization is going in the future. \"Fighting\" of any kind fosters an\nenvironment of opposition or \"us versus them,\" not collaboration. Your CHRO\nprovides the same level of expertise in the HR and talent management fields\nthat your CFO provides in the finance field, and they complement each other.\nThe C-suite should bring together executives that represent both the business\nside and the people side of your organization \u2014 and it shouldn't require an\nact of Congress.\n\n[Forbes Human Resources\nCouncil](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text) is an\ninvitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. _**[Do I\nqualify?](http://www.forbeshrcouncil.com/qualify/?source=forbes-text)**_\n\n[![Regina W.

insights on the just-announced $22 billion marriage.\n\nBy: [Tom Starner](https://hrexecutive.com/author/tom-starner/ \"Posts by Tom\nStarner\") | February 21, 2020 \u2022 5 min read\n\nTopics:

recently\n[announced](https://hrexecutive.com/ultimate-kronos-join-in-major-hcm-merger/)\nthey are soon to become one (the new entity\u2019s name will be announced soon,\naccording to the company), reactions were swift and varied to the projected\n$22 billion marriage. Past history, of course, tells observers that mergers\nare always a risk; some go on to become smashing successes, others just smash\nonto the rocks.\n\nTo global industry analyst [Josh Bersin](https://hrexecutive.com/author/josh-\nbersin/), the impending merger appears to be an \u201copportunistic deal probably\nbased\u201d on the long-term goal of Hellman Friedman [the controlling shareholder\nof both Kronos and Ultimate] to build a large HCM company.\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Ultimate-\nSoftware.2.20.20-700x467.jpg)\n\n(Image credit: Ultimate Software)\n\n\u201cThe two companies believe that, by merging a $1.5 billion company in HCM with\na $1.5 billion company in workforce management, they will create a $22 billion\nmarket cap company,\u201d Bersin says. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of hard to understand from my\nstandpoint.\u201d\n\n**Read the original story:**[ **Ultimate, Kronos join in major\nmerger**](https://hrexecutive.com/ultimate-kronos-join-in-major-hcm-merger/)\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Josh-\nBersin-150x150.jpg)\n\nJosh Bersin\n\nBersin adds that, while he does see many synergies\u2014for example, Kronos can\nsell HCM to its clients, Ultimate can sell workforce management to its\nclients\u2014the real impact is not yet clear.\n\n\u201cAll of Kronos\u2019 existing customers already have an HCM system, and most of\nUltimate\u2019s customers are likely already looking at other workforce-management\ntools,\u201d he says.\n\nBersin adds that observers should remember that ADP has a massive business in\nthe small-to-medium market, and the company\u2019s platform is a far newer, more\nflexible solution than almost any other in the market. He explains that many\nother companies\u2014from Gusto to Bamboo to Zenefits to Paychex to Paycor and\nmore\u2014are all selling integrated HCM products to small companies. That means\nthere is a huge amount of competition for the new entity.\n\n\u201cIn the mid-market companies like ADP, Infor, Ceridian and, of course,\nSuccessFactors, Workday and Oracle and emerging PEOs like TriNet, Insperity,\nSequoia and others are all growing,\u201d Bersin says.\n\n**More from Bersin:[Performance and rewards in the future of\nwork](https://hrexecutive.com/performance-and-rewards-in-the-future-of-\nwork/)**\n\nBersin labels Kronos and Ultimate as \u201ctwo excellent companies with terrific\nproduct sets,\u201d though the reasoning for the merger may have more to do with\ntwo companies looking for a partner and less about \u201csolving new problems\u201d for\nclients.\n\n\u201cThe big issues companies face today are not buying more HR software, but\nactually buying less,\u201d he says. \u201cCompanies are looking for simpler, more\nintegrated solutions\u2014if this merger makes this happen, it could be a long-term\nwinner.\u201d\n\n[Jason Averbook](https://hrexecutive.com/author/jason-averbook/), industry\nanalyst and co-founder/CEO of [Leapgen](https://www.leapgen.com), takes a more\noptimistic view of the deal. He says, in fact, the merger \u201ccreates a\njuggernaut in the HCM-technology market like never seen before.\u201d\n\nAverbook explains that the deal represents a combination of mission-critical\ntechnology foundations: time and labor management and workforce planning along\nwith foundational core people data.\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jason-Averbook106.jpg)\n\nJason Averbook\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about the future of work, these are the foundational drivers\nthat will help organizations be more efficient in maintaining and developing\ntheir workforce,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the same time, it allows them to plot a future\npicture of value for the workforce from both an HR and a business point of\nview.\n\n\u201cThese are two companies that have become wildly successful in creating strong\nfoundations for HR to build upon, and now the whole can be greater than the\nsum of the parts,\u201d Averbook says.\n\n**More from Averbook:[People transformation with a disruptive\nmindset](https://hrexecutive.com/approaching-people-transformation-with-a-\ndisruptive-mindset/)**\n\nHe says this strategic merger for the HR-technology industry ties directly\ninto that priority for HR and business leaders around the world. The Kronos\nand Ultimate Software union, he notes, positions the combined organization for\n\u201camazing synergies\u201d across huge, existing customer bases.\n\n\u201cThis union gives the market a new way to look at the future and the\ndigitization of the people function,\u201d Averbook says, noting that the new\ncloud-computing \u201cjuggernaut\u201d is more than a combination of organizations with\ngreat technology.\n\n\u201cKronos and Ultimate Software are two of the most admired, employee-centric,\nexperience-focused companies we know,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is continued proof for\nour own industry that creating a superior employee experience drives long-\nterm, sustainable value in organizations and will be a competitive\ndifferentiator in all industries for decades to come.\u201d\n\nJohn Sumser, principal analyst at [_HRExaminer_](https://www.hrexaminer.com),\nsays the proposed Ultimate-Kronos entity shows the breadth and depth of the\navailable market in HR tech. With over 33,000 combined clients between the two\nfirms, there are only a few hundred overlaps.\n\n![](https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/John-\nSumser-150x150.jpg)\n\nJohn Sumser\n\n\u201cThe first opportunity for the new enterprise is cross-selling between\naccounts,\u201d Sumser says. \u201cFrom a customer perspective, this means that there is\nlittle to be concerned about in the near- and medium-term. The joint operation\nwill not be sunsetting any product lines.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sumser says, radically rethinking the data asset created by the\nmerger is an \u201cenormous\u201d opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe combined offerings have visibility, from work planning and scheduling\nthrough the full talent-management suite,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is impossible to\noverestimate the value that will be unlocked with projects that apply AI to\nthe entire HR ecosystem.\u201d\n\n**More from Sumser:[When intelligent tools don\u2019t see what\nmatters](https://hrexecutive.com/when-intelligent-tools-dont-see-what-\nmatters/)**\n\nSumser adds that, as with all mergers, the risk is in the execution and\nintegration of the two operations, explaining that the firms are beginning\nwith a \u201cnothing's going to change\u201d approach. But, he says, it is worth noting\nthat the most senior parts of Ultimate Software's leadership\u2014mainly founder\nScott Scherr and CEO Adam Rogers\u2014have chosen to leave.\n\n\u201cWith that, the new firm has $3 billion in revenue, a target of $6 billion by\n2025 and a clear focus on growth.

There are difference levels available, from simply\ncovering basic payroll, to full [PEO\nservices](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-peo-services) which allows all\naspects of HR to be outsourced.\n\nOf course, there is also [HR software](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-hr-\nsoftware) that can be used in house to simplify administration. However, the\nreasons why HR might be outsourced are many, but cost is a key concern.\n\nIt's not just that there is a direct administrative cost in managing HR, but\nalso training and specialism, plus legal and compliance, and additionally\noffice space required to house all relevant HR staff that can become\nespecially expensive in major cities.\n\nAdditionally, HR outsourcing companies can boast staff with years or decades\nof experience, as well as legal teams to ensure compliance. On top of this,\ncompanies that manage many employees across different companies can broker\nspecial compensation package deals which provides added value as well.\n\nOverall, while some people might see HR as a necessary chore, other businesses\nare happy to provide that service with added benefits for a fee that can be\nwell below the cost of setting up HR services in house.\n\nHere therefore are the services providers we think offer the best in HR\noutsourcing.\n\n  * Want your company or services to be added to this buyer\u2019s guide?

ADP and Paychex currently dominate\nthe market, but new vendors are emerging and will continue to do so over the\nforeseeable future \u2013 offering new choices to businesses. New market entrants\nare generally localized, focusing on small and midsized local businesses. The\nnew wave of vendors aims to differentiate themselves based on personalized\nservices and intimate knowledge of the clients\u2019 business environment.\n\n## **Big Players Forced to Adapt**\n\nThe new market landscape threatens established players purchasing smaller\ncompetitors at a surprising rate.\n\nThis is great news for business owners. Increased competition is leading to\nmore comprehensive offerings for a full suite of human capital management\nservices. It is also pushing pricing down for key products. The newly\ncompetitive environment benefits customers who want to outsource some, but not\nall, of their payroll and HR needs. Vendors are now offering small and\nmidsized businesses package options to choose from, along with options to\npurchase functionalities in a piecemeal fashion.\n\n**Learn more:[How to Automate Payroll for SMBs: A Complete\nGuide](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/payroll-administration/how-to-\nautomate-payroll-for-smbs-a-complete-guide/)**\n\n## **New Technologies**\n\nAs the competition increases, payroll providers have no choice but to\nincorporate new technologies into their offering:\n\n  * **The Cloud:** Cloud computing offers clients flexibility and a more convenient way to access information and communicate with remote workers.\n  * **Mobile Access:** As cloud technology makes it easier to access payroll information remotely, many clients desire mobile app access to their data.\n  * **Automation:** Automation allows for faster processing and greater accuracy than is attainable through manual processes.\n  * **Artificial Intelligence:** While still in its infancy, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to perform advanced payroll tasks with minimal human input eventually. As this technology continues to mature, payroll providers are exploring ways to incorporate AI into offerings.\n\n## **What to Consider When Choosing a Payroll Provider**\n\nWith so many new products and a sea of customized offerings, it is becoming\nmore difficult for HR professionals to navigate the landscape and pick the\nsolution that\u2019s best for their organization. Below, we highlight five factors\nthat HR professionals must consider when selecting a payroll provider:\n\n  1. **Necessary Features:** Most crucially, clients must choose payroll solutions that possess their required functionalities. Typically, smaller clients with less developed needs only require straightforward solutions featuring basic functionality like payroll, tax filing, W-2s and 1099s, compliance services, and new hire reporting. Many local providers fulfill these basic needs. However, clients with bigger demands might be better off outsourcing their payroll to larger companies that are more likely to offer several solution packages with features tailored toward clients of different sizes.\n  2. **Price:** Of course, the price remains a crucial consideration when selecting a payroll vendor. Currently, most solutions require a single monthly base fee in addition to small, add-on costs for each employee. However, the pricing of various services also differs based on the provider and the included features **.** Clients must weigh their budget constraints against the above considerations when selecting a payroll provider.\n  3. **Ease of Use:** A payroll solution with excellent features is worthless if the client cannot leverage it effectively. The user interface is a critical consideration when selecting payroll providers. Clients should look for providers offering intuitive interfaces that are easy to learn.\n  4. **Customer Service:** If (or when) things go wrong, it must be easy for clients to reach their provider for assistance. After all, there is nothing more frustrating than waiting days for an answer to a simple question that should have taken minutes. For this reason, we recommend that clients test out the responsiveness of different providers\u2019 customer service lines before settling on a provider.\n  5. **Seamless Integration:** Finally, clients must ensure that their chosen payroll product integrates seamlessly with their existing solutions. Of course, this is necessary because a lack of such integration will result in delays, headaches, and additional costs to the client.  \n\nThe payroll services landscape is shifting in a way that favors the customer.\nNew offerings and solutions are finally making outsourcing a viable option for\npayroll services. But more than ever, businesses must be informed and up-to-\ndate regarding the market to ensure they get the best solution.\n\n**Learn more:[Transforming Payroll With RPA \u2013 Everything You Need

With this release, Cezanne HR\u2019s\ncustomers now benefit from the option to also track attendance, using\ntechnology they already have.\n\nEmployees can quickly and easily log when they start and finish the working\nday, either by logging on to their Cezanne HR system, or by tapping in and out\non a company tablet. Data is instantly updated in the core Cezanne HR system,\ncutting out unnecessary administration, improving accuracy and ensuring a\ncomplete history is maintained.\n\nAlongside real-time attendance tracking and reporting, customers benefit from\nthe option to define their own exception rules, such as how early or late an\nemployee can check in and out, and to set up different time plans for\ndifferent groups of employees.\n\n![](/sites/onrec/directory/files/1_27.png)\n\nJohn Hixon, Director of R&D at Cezanne HR explains: \u201cThe initial impetus for\nthis new functionality was the introduction of legislation in Spain, which\nmakes it mandatory for companies to keep a daily record of the hours employees\nwork.\n\nHowever, in talking with customers elsewhere, it quickly became clear that\nthere is a significant demand for a straightforward attendance tracking system\nthat integrates with core HR \u2013 and doesn\u2019t require expensive, specialist\nhardware or software.\n\n\u201cI am really happy with the solution our team has developed, and we\u2019re looking\nforward to working with customers to add in even more flexibility in the\nfuture\u201d.\n\n####  **Update to Public Holiday libraries**\n\nA real time-save for HR teams is the automatic, accurate calculation of\nentitlement to paid time off that is at the heart of Cezanne HR\u2019s Absence\nmodule. To make admin even more straightforward, the Absence events library in\nCezanne HR has been updated to include public holidays across key geographies\nin 2022.\n\nInstead of having to add these dates

It now has three software-as-a-service suites\nthat cover all the core aspects of managing a company\u2019s workforce from hiring\nto payroll management. Kronos says its products are used by tens of thousands\nof organizations, including half the Fortune 1000.\n\nWeston, Florida-based Ultimate Software competes in the same niche with a\nsuite of cloud-based HR services known as UltiPro. The offering covers many of\nthe same areas as Kronos\u2019 products and is used to manage the personnel records\nof some 51 million workers worldwide.\n\nKronos and Ultimate\u2019s relationship goes much further than just their status as\ncompetitors. Kronos, once a publicly traded company, was taken off the stock\nmarket in 2007 by private equity firm Hellman & Friedman LLC, which [as of\nlast year](https://www.ultimatesoftware.com/PR/Press-Release/Ultimate-\nSoftware-Completes-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-an-Investor-Group-Led-by-\nHellman-and-Friedman-to-Operate-as-a-Privately-Held-Company) is also the\ncontrolling shareholder of Ultimate. And Blackstone Group LP is a minority\ninvestor in both companies.\n\nKronos' and Ultimate\u2019s common ownership means that an acquisition was likely a\nmatter of when rather than if. It\u2019s relatively common for private equity firms\nto merge portfolio companies that can complement each other's strengths, as\nwas the case with Thoma Bravo\u2019s\n[integration](https://www.thomabravo.com/press-releases/j.d.-power-to-merge-\nwith-autodata-solutions-creating-a-leading-source-of-automotive-data-\nanalytics-and-software-solutions) of J.D. Power and Autodata Solutions this\npast December.\n\nHellman & Friedman will remain the controlling shareholder of the combined\ncompany. Blackstone will be the largest minority investor, followed by GIC,\nthe Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and JMI Equity.\n\nThe firm that is set to emerge from the Kronos-Ultimate merger will have\nannual revenues of about $3 billion and 12,000 employees worldwide. The firm\nwill be led by Ain and a management team comprised of executives from both\ncompanies.\n\nWhat\u2019s less clear is what will happen with Kronos and Ultimate\u2019s products. The\n[acquisition\nannouncement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200220005662/en/Kronos-\nUltimate-Software-Enter-Definitive-Merger-Agreement) today stated that the new\nfirm will bring together \u201cthe best\u201d of each company\u2019s solutions, but didn\u2019t\nprovide any further detail.\n\n\"If you lined up Kronos and Ultimate up like race cars starting five years ago\n-- competing on who rebuilds products faster -- Kronos has clearly won, \"\nConstellation Research Inc. analyst Holger Mueller told SiliconANGLE. \"With\nKronos Workforce Dimensions, Kronos has delivered a masterpiece of product\ndevelopment work. Ultimate, on the other hand, has delivered good but\nindustry-average progress.\"\n\nNucleus Research Inc. analyst Trevor White, meanwhile, believes that it\u2019s\nUltimate Software\u2019s UltiPro rather than Kronos' solutions which will be the\nmain focus going forward.\n\n\u201cThis merger is a play for Kronos\u2019s user-base,\u201d White told SiliconANGLE. \u201cIt\u2019s\nbasically saying to Kronos customers that when it comes time to upgrade, they\nshould be going with Ultimate. From an end-user perspective, Kronos is dead \u2013\nor, at the most, set to become an UltiPro Light, as there is no reason for\nthere to be any investment into the product anymore.\u201d\n\n_With reporting from Robert Hof_\n\n##### Photo:\nPkonradk/[Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kronos_HQ_in_spring.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n### Since you're here \u2026\n\nShow your support for our mission with our one-click subscription to our\nYouTube channel (below).

[Find out more about the webinars\n\u00bb](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\n\n### _As we enter a world where technology plays a vital role in many HR\nprocesses, how do we retain the human element, while making the most of the\ntech tools that promise to make HR\u2019s life easier?_ Aditi Sharma Kalra _finds\nout._\n\nIn _The Dark Knight Trilogy_ , film director Christopher Nolan took pains to\npaint vivid pictures of both Batman (aka the Dark Knight) and his on-again-\noff-again ally/adversary, Harvey Dent (aka Two-Face). In the process, he\nproved that every hero has two sides; the complexity of which lies in being\nable to gauge and engage the two faces.\n\nA little bit like the wave of conversations that technology is undergoing at\nthe moment.\n\nWe have a number of use-cases of companies and individuals benefiting from the\napplication of technology, yet there\u2019s a significant number who are hesitant\nto jump onto the bandwagon owing to concerns around privacy, security,\ndehumanisation, cost, and customisation.\n\nIn this feature, we identify experts, from within and outside HR, who are\nahead of the curve in working with technology, and who are able to shed light\non HR\u2019s readiness and experiences of IR 4.0.\n\n### Aviva: Robotics, predictive analytics, and AI\n\nInsurer Aviva is proud of its progress in leveraging HR technology, having\nundertaken three key projects:\n\n  * Implementing robotics for onboarding and off-boarding processes (which are simple, but repetitive and time-consuming, and can be subject to human error);\n  * Using predictive analytics to develop insights on attrition; and\n  * Leveraging on AI and machine learning for scenario planning to reskill/upskill employees.\n\n\u201cWe have huge ambitions to accelerate our business growth and that requires us\nto drive our workforce transformation to ensure we are resourced with the\nright capabilities by building for both current and future needs, as well as\ntapping on technology to create capacity,\u201d says **Anuradha Purbey, People\nFunction Director for Southeast Asia at Aviva** , on the business need for\nthese programmes.\n\nEven before they were implemented, the first step in the journey was changing\nthe team\u2019s mindset \u2013 helping people understand why there was a need for change\nand how they would end up benefitting. One of the ways to do that was the\nmonthly department meetings, where speakers from tech firms, consultancies and\nsuch, came and shared their experience, thus helping the team to better\nunderstand what was out there and what could be applied to the team.\n\n\u201cMaking them feel comfortable and helping them to overcome the fear of change\nis easier said than done, especially if they\u2019ve been doing things a certain\nway for so long. But once there is that mindset shift, the pieces fell into\nplace very quickly,\u201d Purbey explains.\n\nWhile implementing robotics, the challenge was more around the team juggling\nits existing workload while working with the IT team to map out the processes,\ntest the tool and then implement it. \u201cIn this instance, it does get worse\nbefore it gets better \u2026 way better,\u201d she admits.\n\n> ##### The employee life cycle team no longer needs to send out multiple\n> emails to various parties as part of the off-boarding process.\n\nBut since the implementation, the story has been rosy. The employee life cycle\nteam no longer needs to send out multiple emails to various parties as part of\nthe off-boarding process. Its time is now freed up to focus on exit interviews\nto delve deeper into the reasons why employees are leaving.\n\n\u201cBy implementing robotics, we are saving nine man days a month across the\nteam. With the capacity that has created, it has allowed the team to move away\nfrom performing operational tasks to higher value advisory work to drive the\nemployee experience.\u201d\n\nFor predictive analytics on attrition, Aviva is able to use the data and\ninsights to provide strategic advice to hiring managers. It is then empowered\nto take meaningful actions to prevent the outcome (attrition).\n\nMeanwhile, the team has just started using AI and machine learning for\nscenario planning. While it is still early days, it does expect to achieve\nstrategic oversight of budget, capacity and which roles will be impacted by\nemerging technology, enabling it to discover reskilling pathways.\n\nWith a host of benefits to cite, Purbey remains clear that technology will\nnever replace the human element or people as long as they can deliver value.\n\u201cTech will help us do our work in a different way, in most instances, faster\nand better, but that doesn\u2019t mean that people will have less work to do!\nInstead, it allows us to move our focus to higher value work that really\nshifts the needle,\u201d she says.\n\n### Experian: Employee app, digitisation, and analytics\n\nThe technology and digital sector in Malaysia is evolving rapidly, and\ncompanies operating in the country are expanding operations from Malaysia to\nsupport both regional and global landscapes.\n\nThis was a driver for information services provider Experian, when it\nundertook three initiatives: an employee app, digitisation and digitalisation\nof key HR processes, and predictive analytics.\n\nThe first was the digitisation and digitalisation of the entire recruitment\nand onboarding process by implementing and integrating a suite of tools\nenabling its talent acquisition professionals to manage their relationships\nwith candidates and internal stakeholders.\n\n\u201cThe entire process is now managed through a suite of combined technology\ntools as our intention was to move from the old-fashioned ways of managing\nrecruitment processes such as Excel spreadsheets to contemporary looking tools\nwhich will allow us to fully manage the end-to-end recruitment process, while\nmaintaining high productivity levels of the TA team members and the full\nautomation of tasks,\u201d says **Chua Chai Ping, HR Director for Experian\nMalaysia**.\n\nWhat that means is from the first interaction with a candidate, to an\nelectronic offer acceptance, and automated tasks and content-sharing through a\nrich media online platform, the candidate and new hire experience is elevated.\nAs a result, the company is now saving the time of both recruiters and hiring\nmanagers, enabling them to focus on other value-added activities.\n\n> ##### All managers, leaders and stakeholders were introduced to the\n> technology tools prior to implementation, and sufficient workshops were\n> carried out to collate feedback prior to go-live.\n\nThe second initiative was the introduction of its HR-based app across APAC\ncalled Your Choice app, which allows employees easy access to four components:\n\n  * A personalised digital rewards statement.\n  * A benefits allowance through the allocation of annual points for employees to spend on fitness, entertainment, food and beverage or daily essentials.\n  * A monetary employee relief fund for employees or their dependents experiencing hardships, and a support line for when life gets tough.\n  * A focus on their health and wellbeing by giving information and support in real-time on employee devices.\n\nThe third initiative was an in-house built predictive analytics solution for\nHR to give greater insight into the organisation\u2019s workforce and help\naccelerate HR strategies.\n\n\u201cThis interactive online platform provides a truly unique view for HR and\nsupports the core people management processes for leaders to develop the right\nstrategies to reduce attrition, drive churn-related cost savings and improve\noverall business productivity,\u201d Chua explains.\n\nAny technology change and adoption is underlined by a change in human\nbehaviour, and Experian\u2019s experience was no different \u2013 thus, education and\nawareness sessions were given equal importance as technical implementation and\nuser testing.\n\n\u201cAll managers, leaders and stakeholders were introduced to the technology\ntools prior to implementation, and sufficient workshops were carried out to\ncollate feedback for implementation prior to go-live.\u201d\n\nGiven the investment for the tools was done regionally, she credits the\nencouragement and influence of the company\u2019s senior leadership for making it\nsuccessful.\n\nIn the effort to implement this technology, the intention was to build an\noutstanding candidate and employee experience, and Experian has certainly\nachieved that. The talent acquisition process is now fully paperless and\ndigitalised, including onboarding and talent analytics, via a single local set\nof recruitment technology.\n\nAdditionally, all users (employees, managers, recruiters and candidates) have\nmuch greater visibility over their processes, among a host of other benefits\nsuch as the reinforcement to the employee wellbeing agenda, and the reduced\nbusiness impact of losing key talent by making evidence-based decisions.\n\nAs with most new initiatives, she affirms this one shouldn\u2019t be HR-driven, but\nrather a partnership with the business. To continuously measure the results,\nExperian monitors several sentiments and engagement survey results at various\ntouch-points of an employee\u2019s journey at Experian.\n\nIt has also adopted CheckPoint @ HR session, whereby employees, who have spent\ntwo months in the business, are invited to an informal coffee session with the\nHR team to gather live feedback on their onboarding to date, and ideas on how\nto improve further.\n\n### Jewel Paymentech: Goals tracking platform\n\nAs a start-up, one of the common challenges that financial risk technology\ncompany Jewel Paymentech faced was juggling too many priorities and keeping\nteam members focused on what was really important and prioritising what was\nurgent, to deliver outcomes that really mattered.\n\nThis was the backdrop for the team to implement goal-tracking software that\nenables the team to plan, align and track goals; provide guided support on\none-on-one conversations; automate calendar invites; track and record\nconversation points; as well as a platform for employees to seek and receive\nfeedback from multiple parties and track career progress, thus helping the\ncompany to build a succession plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the second year since implementation and the journey has been full of\nlearnings,\u201d says **Evanna Chuah, HR Director for Jewel Paymentech Malaysia**.\n\nFor those who are not familiar with the concept of OKRs (objectives and key\nresults), she explains: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for one to comprehend what those OKRs\nare in your role, and how it connects with the wider network of OKRs of\nmembers around you.\u201d\n\nAs such, in the first year of setting OKRs, the team learnt some hard lessons\n\u2013 the first of which was being overly ambitious with its goals and setting too\nmuch up to achieve.\n\nSecond, while it started off with baby steps by getting familiar with OKRs, it\nquickly realised that some of the OKRs were dependent on other parties to\ncomplete their part on time before handing them over, and when these slip, so\ndoes their OKRs. \u201cLooking deeper into the problem, we realised that the\npriorities amongst different teams on the same objective were not aligned,\u201d\nshe explains.\n\nThe final challenge was in realising the need to \u201creset\u201d the objectives\nquickly, as and when needed.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, we set our goals once, at the beginning of the year and thought that\nwe were set for the rest of the year. We were so wrong,\u201d she admits. \u201cThings\nchanged fast and we did not build a process robust enough to enable us to\nreset our objectives.\u201d\n\n> ##### When something ad hoc hits us, we question ourselves \u2013 does this\n> urgent task fall under any of our overarching objectives, if they are not,\n> why has it become so important?\n\nIs the team doing better this year? Certainly so, as it was more realistic\nabout what can really be delivered. \u201cWhen something ad hoc hits us, we\nconsciously question ourselves \u2013 does this urgent task fall under any of our\noverarching objectives, if they are not, why has it become so urgent and\nimportant?\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cIn fact, we started collaborating with other teams to align our\nOKRs and made them co-own our OKRs.\u201d Furthermore, the team put in time in the\nmiddle of the year to re-look at its OKRs, and invest time to reset objectives\nif need be.\n\nOne thing that was for certain was the use of this technology did not reduce\nthe human element in Jewel Paymentech\u2019s objective setting process. \u201cIn fact,\nit has brought us closer together, and focused us on the right things and\nproducing the right outcomes to help us get there.\u201d\n\nShe cites the one-on-one feature for having increased the quality and\nfrequency of conversations between manager and employee, and more importantly,\nemployees now ask for more one-on-one conversations as this helps them know\n(with crystal clarity) what and how they are contributing to the company,\nwhich keeps them excited and engaged at work.\n\nMoving forward, she clarifies: \u201cIn my opinion, in terms of fully adopting the\napproach of setting stretched objectives, tracking and attaining them, we\u2019re\nnot 100% there yet, but as we constantly review and innovate our approach for\nwhat works for the company, we have certainly done better compared to 2018.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n### Caution! Speed bumps ahead\n\nAmong the several cases of positive experiences, it is equally important for\nHR decision makers to remain cautious when implementing new HR technology, as\nwell as learning from others\u2019 experiences.\n\nTo bring you both sides of the story, we\u2019ve unearthed an example of a HR\npractitioner whose experience wasn\u2019t as smooth as one would have imagined. For\nprivacy reasons, we will withhold the interviewee\u2019s name and organisation,\nreferring to her as Sylvia in this case study.\n\nSylvia shared the experience of implementing an HRIS cloud system from a\ncompany that is based in Malaysia, but has since established itself overseas.\n\n\u201cWhen they came over for a demo, they said everything is possible, and we were\nso impressed,\u201d she says. Thus, the company opted in for the cloud-based system\nwith a monthly subscription, and the added convenience of not paying anything\nmore than a one-time implementation fee.\n\n\u201cFor an SME like ours, we will not be able to purchase from one of the big\nboys. I can almost assure you that most of the local companies will have\nbudget constraints, therefore a subscription-based model, where you don\u2019t have\nto come up with an upfront investment, is ideal for us,\u201d she explains.\n\n> ##### The lessons to keep in mind? \u201cBe mindful of what salespeople claim\n> they can do on PowerPoint, versus what is actually possible in terms of\n> customisation.\u201d\n\nThe system was implemented in March last year, but what followed was a\ncomplete lack of support. Although there was some customer support based\nlocally, the bulk of it was located overseas, which meant slower and untimely\nresponses. Additionally, while the salespeople gave the impression that\n\u201ceverything is possible\u201d when it comes to customisation, the reality wasn\u2019t\nso.\n\nThe lessons to keep in mind? \u201cBe mindful of what salespeople claim they can do\non PowerPoint, versus what is actually possible in terms of customisation.\u201d\n\nAnother lesson from Sylvia\u2019s experience is to allocate sufficient time for\nimplementation. She says: \u201cTypically, the global HQ will decide the timeline,\nand they have a target to keep on moving on to each country, so they will tend\nto rush it. Make sure your team isn\u2019t shortchanged by the speed of\nimplementation.\u201d\n\nFinally, her recommendation on internal marketing \u2013 make sure you don\u2019t\noversell it. \u201cTell your stakeholders the good parts, but also remind them that\nin order to get to that stage, it will take some time and adoption. The change\nmanagement process is really important, in terms of giving them a realistic\npicture.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\n### What's next for HR professionals?\n\n### _Dr Fermin Diez, Adjunct Professor, Singapore Management University (SMU),\non how the HR function will be delivered very differently than it is today,\ngiven the impact of digitalisation, artificial intelligence and robotics._\n\nA 2018 survey by David Green and Ian Bailie at myHRfuture identified key\nskills HR professionals need to develop in order of their future importance.\n\u201cPeople analytics\u201d came in as most important, along with \u201cdigital HR/HR\ntechnologies\u201d. And yet, the next two were \u201csoft\u201d skills such as change\nmanagement and consulting/influencing. It is clear HR professionals need to\nbecome more analytical, but it is equally clear the profession needs to also\nstay grounded on its human aspects.\n\nHR professionals traditionally have shied away from gaining basic data\nliteracy skills, including data visualisation, finance and statistics. Yet\nthey need to become more analytical if they wish to keep pace with the new\ndemands on the profession and be an integral part of the future of the HR\nprofession.\n\n### A glimpse of the HR future\n\nThere are analytics capabilities built into most new and upcoming software\nofferings, which have increased our ability to collect and analyse data. This\ndata holds the promise to help HR analytics teams understand how they can\nimprove the employee experience.\n\nReal-time sentiment and emotion recognition analysis is a fast-growing field,\nwhich is increasingly being used to measure how employees are feeling. There\nis technology to analyse a person\u2019s facial nano-expressions and gauge their\nemotions such as happiness, anger or sadness. Similar technology for voice\nanalysis is already available.\n\nBiosensors and wearables are widely available for personal health and fitness.\nSimilar devices are used in the workplace to help improve health and safety \u2013\nfor example, devices used in high-volume settings which alert employees when\ntheir stress levels are too high.\n\nHowever, future applications do not need to be so individualised. Improving\nany HR process is a good opportunity to apply a design-thinking mindset; get\nfeedback from users, supervisors, vendors and other stakeholders; use the\nfeedback to redesign the process; pilot the new approach; and collect data to\nsee if it is better than the old process.\n\nMany questions remain about this ability to track and use data. We need to\novercome the lack of skills to analyse the data. Technology, and the resulting\ndata, must be validated, especially when it comes to interpreting feelings and\nthoughts. The new technologies have access to sensitive areas, raising\nconcerns about data storage and usage.\n\nThere will also be many HR professionals and employees who will resist change.\nThe handling of sensitive information on an employee\u2019s health or feelings must\nbe handled with extreme care.\n\nThe HR function will need to continuously monitor and update its policies and\ncommunicate these to employees \u2013 about what type of data is being collected,\nfor what purpose, for how long, where it is stored, and the data protection\nmechanisms in place.\n\nWhatever the future holds, it is an exciting time to be an HR professional!\n\n* * *\n\n_This feature was first published in[Human Resources\u2019 August 2019\nedition](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/print/) of the Singapore\nmagazine.

print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE subscription now \u00bb](http://www.lighthouse-\nmedia.com/subhumanresources/)\n\n### _Having led the global search, Erik Ramp, Director of Strategy and\nOperations at Edwards Lifesciences and site leader for the new Kuala Lumpur\nBusiness Services Center, credits the talented workforce, diverse culture,\nmultilingual talent pool, business-friendly policies, and strong\ninfrastructure._\n\n### Q You\u2019ve been with Edwards Lifesciences for about four years now, what\nmotivated you to join the company in 2015?\n\nOne of the main reasons I joined Edwards Lifesciences was because of the\ncompany\u2019s culture. Edwards was the first to develop the commercially viable\nartificial heart valve.\n\nWhen you work at Edwards, you have an opportunity to make a huge impact on\npeople\u2019s lives. We partner with clinicians to develop innovative technologies\nin heart valves and critical care monitoring that helps patients live longer,\nhealthier and more productive lives.\n\nEdwards is the market leader in these advanced therapies: over 95% of our\nsales come from products in the #1 market position.\n\nBefore I joined Edwards, I spent several years in healthcare consulting and I\nfound that many medtech and pharma companies talk about the importance of\ntheir patients. But at Edwards, we really create special connections with our\npatients.\n\n### Q How would you describe your journey with Edwards Lifesciences so far?\nWhat has been your most memorable moment?\n\nEdwards has given me such a great opportunity to develop myself both\nprofessionally and personally. I was actually hired into human resources at\nEdwards to build an internal consulting function that focused on\norganisational design and change management projects for the company. The role\ntaught me what it takes to build successful teams and to lead organisations\nthrough the constant change we all experience.\n\nI\u2019ve visited and worked with colleagues in 11 countries while with Edwards!\nNow the big change is going to be for me and my family as we relocate to Kuala\nLumpur where I will be the Managing Director for our Business Services Center.\n\nI think my most memorable moment was the opening ceremony for our KL Business\nServices Center in April. I was part of a team that performed a worldwide\nsearch and selected KL Eco City as the location for our new office. To see the\noffice evolve from a simple idea at that time, to the reality of being open\nfor business is truly special for me.\n\n> ##### In Asia I am always cautious to provide performance feedback strictly\n> in private so as not to diminish someone\u2019s standing with their co-workers.\n\n### Q Having worked across the US and Asia, what are the key differences in\nworking culture between the regions (if any), and have you had to adapt your\nleadership style accordingly?\n\nI think its important to remember that Asia is actually a very big and\nculturally diverse place. In the US we can make the mistake of not\nunderstanding the important differences that exist between the nationalities,\nethnicities and religions across Asia.\n\nRegardless, I do think there are some common practices in Western business\nculture that are just different when you come to Asia.\n\nFor example, giving and receiving feedback is considered an important part of\nemployee development in the US. As managers, we give feedback with the\nintention of making our employees or co-workers better. Soliciting performance\nfeedback from your manager is considered a sign of maturity and a desire to\ndevelop oneself.\n\nHowever, in Asia I am always cautious to provide performance feedback strictly\nin private so as not to diminish someone\u2019s standing with their co-workers.\n\nIn Asia, respect for seniority is big. It helps clarify decision making at\nwork which is great, but as a Western leader I sometimes feel like I\u2019m missing\nthe real story. In the US we\u2019re quite used to being openly challenged by our\nteams, whereas in Asia it often requires me to single out someone and ask\ntheir opinion directly. Just because someone is quiet, doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t\nhave a brilliant opinion!\n\nOn the flip side, there\u2019s plenty that\u2019s common across cultures as well. In the\nWest, there\u2019s been a movement around 'authentic leadership' in the past\nseveral years. This asks us to bring our 'whole self' to work, including our\npersonal lives, character flaws, etc.\n\nI still practice this with my co-workers in Asia, and although I never expect\nthe same from them, I\u2019ve found that this really translates well across\ncultures. No matter where we grew up, we all can all bond over sleepless\nnights with a newborn baby, having to care for a sick parent who is in the\nhospital (again), a son or daughter struggling in school, or the fact we can\n(or can\u2019t) eat spicy food.\n\n### Q In 2018, you led the global search for Edwards next Business Services\nCentre location and eventually selected Kuala Lumpur. What prompted this\ndecision?\n\nAfter a very long search, we finally chose Kuala Lumpur to house our new BSC\nfor the Japan, Asia and Pacific (JAPAC) region because of the talented\nworkforce, diverse culture, highly capable multilingual talent pool, business-\nfriendly policies and strong infrastructure. Kuala Lumpur\u2019s multicultural\ndiversity will be the most important factor in how we build strong\nrelationships with our colleagues across JAPAC.\n\nWe expect the JAPAC region to grow significantly over the next 7-10 years. As\nEdwards grows, the Kuala Lumpur BSC will provide critical business support\nfunctions such as finance, IT, supply chain, HR, health technology, and\nbusiness leadership. [Edwards is targeting to hire 60 full-time employees in\n2019](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/edwards-lifesciences-launches-\nregional-business-service-centre-in-kuala-lumpur/) and hopes to expand to more\nthan 100+ employees by 2021.\n\n### Q The new KL BSC houses key support functions, as you mentioned, so please\ndo share examples of the HR matters the BSC handles.\n\nCurrently our HR organisational footprint in KL is quite small with just a\nhuman resources business partner (HRBP) and recruiting support. Whenever\nEdwards starts a new location around the world, our HRBP is the very first\nleader we hire and we normally prefer to find local talent who are connected\nintimately with the local policies, regulations, business practices and talent\nmarkets.\n\nWe plan to expand our HR organisation in KL during 2020 as part our HR global\nservices delivery model.\n\n> ##### As a company I think we need to be 'OK' with hiring junior talent who\n> have a hunger to learn.\n\n### Q Moving forward, Edwards plans on setting up an analytics Centre of\nExcellence to house expertise on AI, machine learning, and more. How do you\nplan to mitigate the challenges that come with the scarcity of talent with\nthese niche skills?\n\nData analytics, digital and AI/machine learning are becoming critical skill\nsets in our industry. There is a tremendous amount of data we can mine to help\nimprove patient outcomes and digital channels are increasingly more important\nto how we educate patients and clinicians.\n\nBut these are becoming more capabilities embedded in our marketing,\nengineering, supply chain, and sales analytics roles than jobs themselves. We\nhave some jobs in KL today that require these capabilities and we are finding\nit challenging to hire the right talent.\n\nAs a company I think we need to be 'OK' with hiring junior talent who have a\nhunger to learn. Unfortunately, some hiring managers can see inexperienced\ntalent as a risk. This is where incentives encouraging companies like Edwards\nto hire junior talent and train them up with our internal subject matter\nexperts can be really impactful to creating an ecosystem of talent for\nMalaysia.\n\n### Q What is one way Edwards Lifesciences stands out from others when it\ncomes to attracting talent in the competitive landscape?\n\nOur unwavering patient-focused culture motivates and guides all our global\nteams. People come to work for Edwards for the job, but they stay because they\nidentify with our \u2018patients first\u2019 culture. It\u2019s my goal to have every Edwards\nKL employee get to meet an Edwards patient and experience how we have impacted\ntheir lives.\n\n### Q How closely will you be working with your HR head on this and other\nissues? What is your view of human resources as a business function?\n\nHaving worked in Edwards HR myself, I understand that my HR Business Partner\nin KL can be my most strategic, and important partner. I believe that human\nresources as a business function is evolving (or has already evolved) in much\nthe same way that finance evolved to become the strategic partner to the\nbusiness decades ago.\n\nI partner with my HR head to assess and solve business problems together,\nbecause I feel talent, organisation, communications and culture are usually a\nlarge part of every solution.\n\nIn the next couple years, we\u2019ll experience tremendous growth in KL and we must\nbe prepared for the organisational challenges that come; laying down systems\nand processes, establishing our local identify as Edwards KL and ensuring that\nwe stay connected to the patients first culture that makes Edwards so unique.\nThese are challenges only a strategic HR partner can help us solve.\n\n> ##### Whatever you think you\u2019ll be doing in your career five years from now,\n> I can guarantee you won\u2019t be doing that! So don\u2019t be so planned or anxious\n> about your future.\n\n### Q What is the number one way the HR function brings value to the business?\nHow does the CHRO maintain their position in the boardroom?\n\nThe number one way HR can bring value to the business is by ensuring that\ntalent is a strategic driver of the company\u2019s success. To do this, HR must\nintimately understand the strategy of the business, respond to changes\nrapidly, and put mechanisms in place that ensure HR programmes are supporting\nthe business strategy.\n\nFor the CHRO to maintain their position in the boardroom it must start with a\nCEO and executive leadership team that recognises people as foundational to\nthe business strategy.\n\nAt Edwards, we are lucky to have a phenomenal CHRO who has business savvy and\ncomes from a broad HR background so she\u2019s literally done every job in HR. She\nparticipates in the strategic planning process for the company and translates\nthe business imperatives into imperatives for HR to execute each year. These\n'projects' are how we ensure HR resources are being deployed towards the top\npriorities of the business.\n\n### Q If you could turn back time, what career advice would you give your\nyounger self?\n\nWhatever you think you\u2019ll be doing in your career five years from now, I can\nguarantee you won\u2019t be doing that! So don\u2019t be so planned or anxious about\nyour future. Be intellectually curious and focus on helping the people around\nyou get better! With that, everything else will fall into place.\n\n_Photo / Provided_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

Kristina Johnson, chief people\nofficer of Okta, notes that for the first time three of the top 10 apps\noverall by the number of users were HR-related, with Workday ranking number\ntwo, SAP SuccessFactors in eighth place, and Cornerstone OnDemand in ninth.\n\nWorkday, which was founded in 2005, has been listed for years in the\nBusinesses @ Work report and has been a leader in the human capital management\nfield, offering apps and tools to many of the world\u2019s largest organizations.\n\n\u201cWorkday offers its customers a one-stop-shop for business planning, financial\nmanagement, and HCM,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cThe convenience of being able to access\nall these resources from a single system makes the app sticky for\norganizations, not just HR pros.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a competitive race for HR users unfolding among solutions in the\nnext tier of popularity. One of the most notable developments over the past\nyear was that BambooHR jumped ahead of UltiPro this year on the list of most\npopular HR tools as measured by the number of customers using these apps,\nJohnson explains.\n\n\u201cBoth BambooHR and UltiPro have shown impressive growth over time, but\nBambooHR\u2019s rise in popularity has been slightly stronger, growing by 286% over\nthe past three years compared to UltiPro\u2019s 226% growth,\u201d she says.\n\n**See also:** [The 10 fastest-growing HR\napps](https://www.benefitnews.com/list/the-10-fastest-growing-hr-apps)\n\nStellar track records from those companies reinforces HR leaders\u2019 search for\nways to automate time-intensive work and increase efficiencies, Johnson says.\n\u201cBoth tools offer a suite of services that allow HR leaders to streamline\nprocesses for everything from hiring and onboarding to payroll and benefits,\u201d\nshe says, noting how all-in-one services make lives easier.\n\nM&A activity is also a factor to consider when assessing the rise of certain\napps. She cites UltiPro growth as an example, noting how parent company\nUltimate Software acquired PeopleDoc in 2018.\n\nOther popular HR apps rounding out the top 10 list include SAP SuccessFactors,\nNamely, Culture Amp, Reflektive, iCIMS, 15Five and Halogen. Culture Amp and\n15Five made their debut on the Businesses @ Work list, both focused on\nimproving employee review processes. This shows that \u201ccompanies are serious\nabout helping employees advance their careers,\u201d Johnson says. On the other end\nof the spectrum, she adds that WageWorks and Zenefits dropped off in\npopularity.\n\n**See also:** [McDonald\u2019s app offers employees career advancement\nbenefit](https://www.benefitnews.com/news/mcdonalds-app-offers-employees-\ncareer-advancement-benefit)\n\nAnother significant theme was the rise of best-in-breed solutions, with many\ncompanies double-dipping on workplace apps. For example, Johnson says they may\nuse the Microsoft Office 365 product suite alongside apps with redundant\nfunctions like Slack and Zoom.\n\n\u201cWhile some teams might prefer going all-in on software suites, at the end of\nthe day functionality and employee needs are driving purchasing decisions,\u201d\nshe says.\n\nMeanwhile, venture capitalists are recognizing the potential for innovation in\nthe HR space. Both Culture Amp and 15Five, newcomers to the top HR apps list,\nclosed big funding rounds in 2019, while Namely also raised more than $200\nmillion. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see how continued investment in HR technology will\npush the industry forward,\u201d Johnson says.

Transformation is the outcome of digitization. It is not\nthe process of digitization itself._\n\n![](https://images.hrtechnologist.com/images/uploads/native_assets_images/hcm_bg_5d834bf8d52f2.jpg)\n\n### Human Capital Management (HCM) Suites for High-growth Enterprises: The\nUltimate Guide [Buyers Guide]\n\nYour HCM System controls the trinity of talent acquisition, management and\noptimization - and ultimately, multiple mission-critical performance outcomes.\nChoosing the right solution for your organization....\n\n[Download](https://assets.hrtechnologist.com/research/human-capital-\nmanagement-hcm-suites-for-highgrowth-enterprises-the-ultimate-guide-buyers-\nguide-128468?tfso=150406&zd_source=native_assets)\n\n\u201cWhen digital transformation is done right, it\u2019s like a caterpillar turning\ninto a butterfly, but when done wrong, all you have is a really fast\ncaterpillar.\u201d\n\n_\u2013 George Westerman_\n\n[_Principal Research Scientist with the MIT Sloan Initiative on the Digital\nEconomy_](https://executive.mit.edu/blog/the-digital-business-transformation-\nimperative#.XPYp0I4zbIU)\n\nDigital transformation is a process and an outcome. It is a revolutionary\nchange but also an evolutionary phenomenon. In addition to digitization, the\ntransition to business with technology at its center also entails a shift in\nthe culture and mindset of an organization.\n\nMuch like every other part of the organization, the digital transformation of\nHR is essential in an age where technological disruption is the norm.\nAccording to a Deloitte survey, digital transformation budgets are going to\nincrease by 25 percent in the next year. With the advent of artificial\nintelligence (AI), blockchain, machine learning, automated performance\nmanagement, and much more, HR teams that still rely on Excel sheets to collect\nand interpret data need to make the shift to automation, and quickly.\n\nIn this primer on digital transformation, we look at what digital\ntransformation in HR means, what it entails, and the challenges that\nbusinesses face in enabling this transformation in HR.\n\n## **Table of Contents**\n\n  * **Section I: What is Digital Transformation in HR?**\n  * **Section II: What Are Digitization, Digitalization, and Digital Transformation?**\n  * **Section III: Digital Transformation Strategy: How to Enable Digital Transformation in HR**\n  * **Section IV: HR\u2019s Role in Business-Wide Digital Transformation**\n  * **Section V: Challenges to the Digital Transformation of HR**\n  * **Section VI: Closing Thoughts**\n\n##  \n**Section I: What is Digital Transformation in HR?**\n\n![What is the goal of HR\u2019s digital transformation](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 1. What is the goal of HR\u2019s digital transformation?**\n\nThe goal of digital transformation in HR may be multifold:\n\n  * To automate processes and reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks.\n  * To maximize the **[employee experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-employee-experience/).**\n  * To use the freed-up time to strategize and ultimately benefit the business bottom line.  \n\nHR digital transformation is the transformation in the way HR functions, using\ndata to guide all areas of HR: payroll, benefits, **[performance\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)** , **[learning and\ndevelopment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-\ndevelopment/what-is-learning-and-development-objectives-strategy/)** , rewards\nand recognition, and hiring.\n\nThe role of HR teams in digital transformation is twofold:\n\n  1. It is responsible for its own transformation \u2013 using automation and digital, data-led processes.\n  2. In collaboration with the IT department, HR is now being asked to lead organizations towards digital transformation and support its continual digital evolution. This involves empowering employees with a digital mindset to improve workforce processes and enhance productivity.  \n\n## **Section II:** **What Are Digitization, Digitalization, and Digital\nTransformation?**\n\n![Digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation](/images/ajax-\nloader.png)\n\n**Fig 2. Digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation: Each step\nleads to the next**\n\nThese three terms, often used interchangeably, have subtle differences in\nmeaning. Each step leads to the next. It is important to identify these\ndifferences to know where you stand in the digital transformation journey.\n\n### 1\\. Digitization\n\n  \nDigitization is a shift from manual processes to digital processes. For\nexample, digitizing the performance records of employees from 10 years ago.\n\n### 2\\. Digitalization\n\n  \nDigitalization involves becoming a digital-led organization, an organization\nthat leverages digital tools for its daily operations. Digitalization involves\ncreating a culture of using technology to run a business.\n\nFor instance, the impact of AI on the HR industry is real and tangible. AI is\nmost efficient in the hands of people who:\n\n  1. Are willing to acknowledge that AI can help, not hurt, their job.\n  2. Possess the critical thinking skills required to interpret the data it presents.\n  3. Possess the creative thinking skills required to use the data to develop an HR strategy that will deliver business outcomes.  \n\nAn ideal example of digitalization is an organization led by artificial\nintelligence that uses the technology to leverage the insights it offers into\nkey processes.\n\n### 3\\. Digital transformation\n\n  \nDigital transformation comprises both digitization and digitalization. It\ninvolves automating processes and creating a culture of automation. But it\ngoes a step further and questions which processes are needed at all,\neliminating rote tasks that held value when processes were manual but now have\nno place in a digital organization.\n\nThe transformation journey entails identifying problems that need to be solved\nand using technology in the most efficient way possible to solve those\nproblems. It requires the mindsets across the organization to be changed, and\nthis change begins from the leadership and trickles down to the rest of the\ncompany.\n\nDigital transformation is the outcome of digitization and digitalization: it\nresults in an agile organization, ready to adapt to the rapid evolution of\ntechnology.\n\n## **Section III: Digital Transformation Strategy: How to Enable Digital\nTransformation in HR**\n\n![digital transformation strategy](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 3. Steps to build and implement a digital transformation strategy**\n\nIn a piece titled \u201cWhat We\u2019ve Gotten Wrong About HR Transformation,\u201d Dave\nWeisbeck, Chief Strategy Officer at Visier, asks HR to stop HR transformation\nfor transformation\u2019s sake.\n\nHe says, \u201cI\u2019m going to take a bold stance here and recommend that any business\ncurrently undergoing an HR transformation, or thinking about doing so, stop\nimmediately unless your stakeholders can clearly state why, and you know\nexplicitly how to measure success quantitatively.\u201d\n\nThis is the first step to beginning the digital transformation of HR \u2013 asking\nthe relevant questions. Then comes the actual process of implementing the\ntransformation\u2014\n\n### 1\\. Define the goal you want to achieve by implementing HR\u2019s digital\ntransformation\n\n  \nIn defining the goal of digital transformation, consider asking the following\nquestions to establish value creation from transforming HR:\n\n**a. Will it make things easier for everyone involved or affected by the\nprocess?**\n\nThe digital transformation should benefit the end user. That means if HR wants\nto implement an automated performance management system that will allow them\nto gather data to decide salary appraisals, managers and employees should also\nbe given access to this platform to view and update it.\n\n**b. Is this goal measurable?**\n\nThe goal should be outcome-oriented, not output oriented. For example, an\noutput-oriented goal is to use an AI-based tool to increase the number of\nscreened candidates per month during a recruitment cycle. For this, you can\nhave a target and ensure that it is achieved.\n\n_What is the expected outcome?_ That the screening provides a database of\nquality candidates who have the potential to be a part of the next round of\ninterviews.\n\n_How will you measure this?_ Each candidate can be assigned a score by the\nsolution you are using, and the number of candidates having a certain score\ncan be the measure of the success of this solution.\n\n**c. Will it have a positive financial impact on the business?**\n\nThis goal of transformation must be tied to the business goal. The success of\na digital transformation project is measured by the business value it adds.\nFor example, the goal could be to reduce the cost per hire or the cost per\nreplacement and thus reduce overall business expenditure. Alternatively, the\ngoal could be to improve revenue by hiring the right candidate using an AI-led\ncandidate screening process.\n\n### 2\\. Identify who will implement this transformation\n\n  \nLine managers and HR practitioners themselves must take responsibility for\nthis transformation. Line managers deal with employees directly, and any\nchange to HR practices directly affect these managers and their teams. It is\nlikely that these managers may be most excited about the transformation and\nrelate to key areas where HR processes need to improve for them.\n\n### 3\\. Hire additional resources for the digital transformation process if\nrequired\n\n  \nNaturally, you will have to invest in the tool you need to perform a certain\njob. But beyond that, you may need to hire people for the role. For example,\nif one of your processes is to use AI to gain insights about engagement and\nperformance in your organization, you may want to hire a data scientist to\nmake sense of the data and simplify the insights it offers to help you improve\nbusiness strategy.\n\n### 4\\. Define a time frame within which you will establish that a certain\ntool is a success\n\n  \nEach process must be given a certain amount of time to demonstrate its value\nto the organization. For instance, a three-month window to implement a new\ncandidate-screening tool is enough to tell you whether it is capable of\noffering you a quality candidate database.\n\n### 5\\. Identify which processes will be phased out with the intervention of a\ndigital platform\n\n  \nIn the recruitment cycle, for example, the process of going through job boards\nand LinkedIn to find candidates may be eliminated altogether with the\nimplementation of a recruitment/screening software. When you identify\nprocesses to be replaced, it may also require the reorganization of management\nand a more open, less hierarchical structure. For instance, even your intern\nmay be able to offer inputs for low-level strategy or may be able to initiate\nthe second round of candidate screening.\n\n### 6\\. Then, make the case to the C-suite to invest in the resources you need\n\n  \nMaking a business case to the C-suite is always a challenge. While businesses\nare ready to increase their spends on digital transformation, they often find\nit challenging to entrust an entire department to take it on with minimum risk\nof failure. However, by answering the first five questions in depth, you can\nbuild a business case that relies on thorough research, giving your leaders\nmeaningful reasons to invest in the software you need.\n\nTo understand which technologies will be most suited to your workplace,\nconsider the difference between technology enablement and digital enablement.\n\nGordon Laverock, Managing Partner, Presence of IT, says: \u201cWithout\nunderstanding the difference between technology enablement and digital\nenablement, simply automating a process won\u2019t necessarily add value.\nTechnology enablement is using a tool to produce an outcome, while digital\nenablement is less about the application of technology, and more about\nchoosing the right technology to sustainably elevate and advance a workforce.\u201d\n\n### 7\\. Prepare your team for the change\n\n  \nA change in HR processes means all stakeholders involved need to be prepped\nand prepared for this change. However, we recommend starting small. HR leaders\nare concerned that organizations that are waiting to watch how digital\ntransformation will play out are going to fall behind. Even so, starting on a\nsmaller scale (if you must) can minimize the impact of failure (if any) than\nmaking an organization-wide change, and as a result, abandoning any digital\ntransformation endeavor altogether. It\u2019s much easier to apply feedback and\nlearnings from a pilot project to a company-wide one, than making errors in a\nlarge-scale rollout.\n\nAnand Shankar, Human Capital Partner at Deloitte India, in an exclusive chat\nwith HR Technologist, suggested creating \u201cedge teams\u201d for smooth digital\ntransformation \u2013 teams that start with fresh processes and don\u2019t disrupt\neverything that already exists to go digital.\n\nSo, for example, a small team within the HR team can transition to automated\ncandidate screening for associate-to-mid-level positions while the remaining\nrecruitment team follows an older process to identify best-fit candidates for\nmanagerial positions. This means you haven\u2019t disrupted traditional processes.\nYou are simply experimenting with a new one. With this, the impact of the\nfailure is lower.\n\n### 8\\. Create a culture of digitalization\n\n  \nThe essence of HR\u2019s digital transformation lies in creating a culture of\ndigitalization. This involves not just learning how to use automated solutions\nbut learning how to use them so that they enhance human capabilities. For\nexample, decisions that are based on data obtained from a digital solution,\nsay an AI **[recruitment analytics\ntool](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nrecruitment-data-analytics-software/)** , can drive measurable outcomes such\nas the strategy to reduce time-to-fill, showing the organization the benefit\nof focusing on data.\n\nAndrew Wilson, CIO at Accenture, shared with HR Technologist how the digital\ntransformation process was undertaken at his organization: \u201cTo ensure a smooth\ndigital transformation, it is essential for organizations to put their\nemployees first, rather than the technology. This allows users to adopt the\nnew technology, rather than the other way around, to make the adoption\nsmoother.\n\n\u201cAt Accenture, we have found the grassroots approach to be particularly\neffective when implementing technology to our employees across the globe. Our\ninternal IT organization provides new technology to those who want it, and\nthen relies on those individuals to promote it, as change is often more\naccepted from peers than when pushed from the top. This emulates the consumer\nworld and is reflective of the way services are consumed today.\u201d\n\n### What if you don\u2019t achieve the goal?\n\n  \nIt is possible that you transition to new technology, train your team to use\nit, and then realize that it is not working effectively. This is likely to\nhappen. Most companies don\u2019t get it right on the first go.\n\nOrganizations that succeed in their transformation projects are those that are\nwilling to take risks and are open-minded. This combination can be the make-\nor-break factor in the digital transformation of the organization. What you\nneed is a team that must be prepared to learn, unlearn, and relearn new\nprocesses.\n\nTo understand why you may have missed your digital transformation goals:\n\n  1. **Identify where the glitches are.** Are candidates having a tough time interacting with the software? Is your recruitment team unable to utilize the dashboard associated with the tool to clearly understand which candidate is a good choice and which isn\u2019t?  \n\n  2. **Coach your team to open their minds to digitization.** New technology can be intimidating, and sometimes, it may negatively affect the performance of your team before it enhances it. Use data to coach your team to embrace a more positive mindset.  \n\n  3. **Re-evaluate your digital solution of choice.** Maybe this tool does not serve your specific purpose. Maybe you need something more advanced or just a different solution. This is why establishing the purpose of the solution before you invest in one is important. It minimizes the chance of a solution not working out for your requirements.\n\n  \nFollowing these steps may help you advance to the next step, or it may take\nyou back to the drawing board. Either way, an assessment is necessary to\nensure that you are on the right track. ****\n\n## **Section IV: HR\u2019s Role in Business-Wide Digital Transformation**\n\nAs HR takes responsibility for its own digital transformation, it is also\nexpected to take the lead in enabling the transformation of the rest of the\norganization. While IT takes care of the digital aspect, HR\u2019s role is more\noriented to the human aspect \u2013 helping change the mindset and helping create\nthe culture. Simply put, as the custodian of the human experience in the\nworkplace, HR is at the center of enabling digital transformation.\n\nEmployees love consumer-grade experiences in their personal lives, like\nchatting with a chatbot to complain about the late delivery of their food\norder. But in the workplace, they may fear the same chatbot for a variety of\nreasons. For example, they may fear that the information they share with these\nchatbots may be used against them, that this automated tool will take their\njob from them, or simply believe that this trend might not last.\n\n\u201cBehavior change is a critical aspect when implementing new technology. In the\nend, it\u2019s the people that make a business successful,\u201d posits Andrew.\n\nHe then recommends unique ways to get employees on board when implementing a\ndigital transformation project. \u201cHR can help to provide learning experiences\nof different kinds for employees to make learning fun, engaging and\neffective,\u201d he suggests.\n\nFor example, in getting employees to use AI-powered tools, you can tell them\nthat it is AI that auto-generates a playlist for them to listen to on Spotify\nbased on their preferences. This can open up their mind to the positive\nfeatures of AI, and they are more likely to embrace it as a useful tool.\n\nSome of the other benefits you can highlight are:\n\n  1. **Quickness:** How easily a digital solution will improve the speed at which employees work.\n  2. **Simplicity:** How easy it is to use the solution.\n  3. **Freedom from repetitive tasks:** How it frees up time to do more creative tasks.\n  4. **Anonymity:** How, while data collection is the norm, in some areas (such as in engagement surveys), the data is collected anonymously to help identify an organization-wide trend only.\n\n  \nIn addition, \u201cBy providing learning both on-demand and through multiple\nchannels in everyday activities, your employees can learn efficiently in real\ntime and actual context. It\u2019s also essential to make learning highly\nimmersive, interactive and self-paced, so employees can practice tasks\nspecific to their daily activities in the context of their jobs and at the\nrate of change they are comfortable with,\u201d recommends Andrew.\n\n**Learn More:[The Definitive Guide to AI in Employee\nEngagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/definitive-guide-to-ai-employee-engagement/)**\n\n## **Section V: Challenges to the Digital Transformation of HR**\n\n![The challenges that occur in most digital transformation\nefforts](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**Fig 4. The challenges that occur in most digital transformation efforts**\n\nYes, we need digital solutions to everything, but where are the bottlenecks?\n\u201cTechnology is not worth the investment if it is not properly adopted and\neffectively used, and it must deliver value to the organization,\u201d says Andrew.\nResistance to adoption is one of the key challenges that organizations face.\n\nIn addition, some of the other challenges that you can face while starting off\nare:\n\n  1. Lack of a clear strategy or goal for digital transformation\n  2. Resistance from the C-suite to invest\n  3. Lack of budget to enable digital transformation\n  4. Lack of expertise in leading the digital transformation project\n  5. Lack of agility in upgrading to new digital solutions  \n\nThese issues are common and addressing them requires resilience from HR. \u201cIt\nwill take time to build a workforce that will leverage these emerging\ntechnologies effectively,\u201d asserts Andrew. Having said that, they can be\naddressed over a period of time. But creating a sense of urgency to initiate\ndigital transformation is critical, and it will be taken seriously only when\nyou make a strong business case for the project. \u201cHR employees will need to\nreskill and retrain their employees at a faster pace than ever to keep up with\ntechnology trends and implementation,\u201d he insists.\n\n## **Section VI: Closing Thoughts**\n\nDigital transformation aims to create an agile organization that is ready to\nchange as technology keeps advancing. Technology will always be ahead of the\ncurve as organizations try to catch up. The absence of this agility can be one\nof the reasons why digital transformation strategies fail.\n\nWhat you as an HR professional can do is prepare your organization and your\nteam to remain engaged in this process, and adopt technology at its peak,\noptimally. For that, you need to be prepared yourself. Stay aware, stay\ncurrent, and ensure that you know what your competitors are doing in the same\narea. Keep an eye on the pulse of the organization and what it is\nsaying/doing. This will allow you to initiate, complete, and keep moving\nforward with your vital digital transformation project.\n\n**_Have you undertaken a digital transformation project at your organization?\nWhat were some of the challenges you faced?

From electric incandescent light bulbs and induction\nmotors to today\u2019s modern technologies serving the energy, infrastructure,\nstorage and electronic devices and IoT sectors, Toshiba continues to\ncontribute to the evolution of daily life and social development. I\u2019m very\nheartened to be working in a company that positively impacts the communities\naround us.\n\nHaving worked across multiple business units, I have had the pleasure of\nworking with many brilliant and passionate like-minded individuals who are in\ntandem with the company\u2019s goals. As we move towards becoming a cyber-physical\nsystems technology company, we have a strong and unified team which makes work\nproductive and enjoyable.\n\n**Q What do you believe are the top qualities of a good leader?**\n\nA leader is someone who is visionary, inspires others to contribute to the\nvision and allows the team to move together towards a shared view of the\nfuture. Leaders should not only lead by example, but they should also be\nattuned to feedback and opinions from the people around them.\n\nHonesty and integrity are key. Leaders who place importance on these will\ninspire the right attitude in employees. Leaders should delegate tasks for\ngrowth \u2013 it not only helps empower employees, but also connects them to the\nbigger picture. To me, what makes a great leader is someone with these\nqualities, but also leads with \u201cheart\u201d \u2013 authenticity, transparency and\nhumility.\n\n**Q What is your view of HR as a business function? How closely do you work\nwith your HR head?**\n\nTo me, human resources serves as the heart of an organisation. No longer seen\nas just an administrative function, HR has evolved to become a strategic\nfunction that deploys the right talent strategy to attract and retain the best\ntalent, giving companies a competitive advantage against their competitors.\n\nIn my role, I work closely with my human resources team to evaluate broad-\nbased strategies for hiring, retention and training, as well as performance\nevaluation and indicators.\n\nWith the shift in workplace demographics and hiring trends, our strategies\nneed to constantly change to respond to the needs of the talent pool.\n\nWe also talk about improving the current performance evaluation indicators to\nbe more well-rounded and inclusive rather than based solely on work\nperformance. With a more robust evaluation, it will help us to identify,\ndevelop and train the potential leaders of tomorrow.\n\nWe also recognise that training impacts human capital and competency building.\nSo we invest in relevant development programmes to raise productivity and\npromote continuous learning.\n\n**Q Describe your ideal CHRO.**\n\nMy ideal CHRO should be fair, data-centred and forward-thinking. A CHRO should\npromote an employee-conscious environment which respects fair practices and\ntransparency, which helps to build trust and improve overall employee\nsatisfaction.\n\nFurther, the modern CHRO should understand and be comfortable to work with\ndata, using it to pick out trends and improve decision-making. It is also no\nlonger enough to do operational reviews looking at past performance, but one\nneeds to be predictive and forward-looking and tackle issues such as people-\nrelated failures or missed opportunities.\n\n_Photo / provided_\n\nHuman Resources magazine and the HR Bulletin daily email newsletter:  \nAsia's only regional HR print and digital media brand.  \n[Register for your FREE

[Find out more about the webinars\n\u00bb](https://webinars.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRwebinar_2020)\n\nAn enhanced wage credit scheme, a scheme to retain local workers, and a\nSkillsFuture support package for mid-career professionals - these are some of\nthe things HR, employers and employees can look forward to in the next few\nyears, as part of **Singapore 's Budget 2020** initiatives.\n\n**Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat** ,\n[delivered his #SGBudget2020 speech in Parliament\nyesterday](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/live-updates-singapore-\nbudget-2020/), putting forth a range of support measures for Singapore, of\nwhich a range would help workers and enterprises deal with economic\nuncertainties brought forth by the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n## A brief economic overview\n\n[According to DPM Heng](https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/docs/default-\nsource/budget_2020/download/pdf/fy2020_budget_statement.pdf), Singapore's\neconomy grew by a modest 0.7% in 2019, the weakest growth since the 2008\nfinancial crisis. Just as the global economy started to recover, the COVID-19\noutbreak struck, and would \"certainly impact\" the country's economy, he\nshared.\n\nDPM Heng added: \"The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) has downgraded the\nGDP forecast from between 0.5% to 2.5%, to between -0.5% and 1.5%. However,\nthe duration and severity of this outbreak and the impact on the global\neconomy are still unclear.\n\n\"While MTI's baseline is for GDP growth to come in at 0.5% for the full year,\nwe must be prepared that the economic impact may be worse than we projected.\"\n\nIn light of this and in efforts to protect the people and their families, the\ngovernment will set aside an additional S$800mn in the Budget to support\nfrontline agencies who have been fighting and containing the outbreak.\n\n**Budget 2020 will aim to address these challenges and opportunities:**\n\n  * To grow Singapore's economy, and transform its enterprises;\n  * Care for and nurture Singaporeans at every stage of their lives;\n  * Build a liveable and sustainable Singapore in the face of climate change, secure sovereignty as an independent nation, and ensure its fiscal sustainability; and\n  * Work with Singaporeans to build a nation and a home to call their own.\n\nThe manpower-relevant initiatives for HR leaders and employers are summarised\nbelow.\n\n* * *\n\n## COVID-19 special packages: Job support, wage credit scheme enhanced,\ncorporate tax rebates\n\nThe first is the **Stabilisation and Support Package**. This will stabilise\nthe economy and support workers and enterprises, by helping workers to stay in\ntheir jobs and enterprises with cash flow. The government will provide\nadditional help to sectors more directly affected by the outbreak.\n\nTo elaborate on the first package, the **Stabilisation and Support Package**\nwould amount to S$4bn and, in supporting enterprises, their wage costs will be\ndefrayed through two schemes:\n\nFirst, there is the **Job Support Scheme** , to help enterprises retain their\nlocal workers. For every local worker in employment, the government will\noffset 8% of the wages, up to a monthly wage cap of S$3,600, for three months.\nThis payment will be given to employers by the end of July 2020; the scheme\nwill total S$1.3bn, and will benefit all enterprises and the 1.9mn local\nemployees in Singapore.\n\n![Priya-Feb-2020-Budget-2020-MOF-Job-Support-Scheme-table-ANNEX-\nscreengrab](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/19110715/Priya-Feb-2020-Budget-2020-MOF-Job-Support-\nScheme-table-ANNEX-screengrab.jpg)\n\nSecond, the government will enhance the **Wage Credit Scheme** to support wage\nincreases for Singaporean workers. Currently, this scheme co-funds wage\nincreases for Singaporean employees earning a gross monthly wage of up to\nS$4,000. Moving forward, the monthly wage ceiling will be raised from S$4,000\nto S$5,000, for qualifying wage increases given in 2019 and 2020, to benefit\nmore Singaporean employees.\n\nThe government co-funding levels for 2019 and 2020 qualifying wage increases\nwill also be raised by five percentage points, to 20% and 15% respectively.\n\nWith these enhancements, another S$1.1bn will go to about 90,000 enterprises,\nto benefit more than 700,000 Singaporean employees.\n\n![Priya-Feb-2020-Budget-2020-MOF-Wage-Ceiling-table-ANNEX-\nscreengrab](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/19111353/Priya-Feb-2020-Budget-2020-MOF-Wage-Ceiling-\ntable-ANNEX-screengrab.jpg)\n\n\n\nTo support households, the government will provide a special **Care and\nSupport Package** , to provide additional, timely help to more households with\ncost of living. The less well-off will get more help.\n\nApart from the above, the **Stabilisation and Support Package** will also\nprovide economy-wide support to help enterprises with cash flow.\n\nFirst, will be the grant of a **Corporate Income Tax Rebate** for Year of\nAssessment 2020, at a rate of 25% of tax payable, capped at S$15,000 per\ncompany. This rebate will benefit all tax-paying companies and cost about\nS$400mn.\n\nSecond, will be the **enhancement of several tax treatments under the\ncorporate tax system for one year**. DPM Heng shared: \"For instance, I will\nallow enterprises a faster write-down of their investments in plant and\nmachinery, and renovation and refurbishment, incurred for Year of Assessment\n2021. This will put more cash in the hands of our enterprises. For example,\nhotels can now take advantage of this lull period to carry out upgrading work,\nand be better prepared for the upturn.\"\n\nThird, in helping enterprises access working capital more easily, the\ngovernment will also **enhance the Enterprise Financing Scheme 's Working\nCapital Loan component for one year**. The maximum loan quantum will be raised\nfrom S$300,000 to S$600,000, and risk-share on these loans will be increased\nto 80%, from the current 50% to 70%.\n\nThe government will also support tenants and lessees of government-managed\nproperties, including those under JTC, HDB, SLA, STB, and SDC. They can\napproach the government agencies to discuss options for more flexible rental\npayments such as instalment plans. Each request will be assessed individually,\ntaking into account the enterprise's circumstances.\n\n**Sectors directly affected by COVID-19 (i.e. tourism, aviation, retail, food\nservices, and point-to-point transport services) will get additional support\nin the form of:**\n\n  * Enhanced support under the Adapt and Grow initiative for 2020, specifically through **redeployment programmes in the tourism, aviation, retail, and food services sectors**.\n  * The government will extend the funding period for reskilling from three months to a maximum of six months.\n  * Together with the Jobs Support Scheme, support will be provided to help employers in these sectors to **ret** **ain and train more than 330,000 local workers**. These workers can make full use of the downtime for training and upskilling, to prepare for the recovery.\n\n**Affected sectors will also get help with operating costs and cash flow, as\nfollows:**\n\n**Tourism sector**\n\n  * A **Property Tax Rebate of 30%** for the year 2020, for the accommodation and function room components of licensed hotels and serviced apartments, and prescribed Meetings, Incentives, Conventions, and Exhibitions venues.\n  * International cruise and regional ferry terminals will receive a 15% Property Tax Rebate, and the Integrated Resorts will receive a 10% Property Tax Rebate.\n  * For enterprises in the tourism sector, the government will work with Participating Financial Institutions to introduce a **Temporary Bridging Loan Programme** for a year, with a loan quantum of up to S$1mn and interest rate capped at 5%. The government will take on 80% of the risk of the loan. This will provide more cash flow on top of the enhanced working capital loan.\n\n**Aviation sector**\n\n  * The government will implement a suite of measures, comprising rebates on aircraft landing and parking charges, assistance to ground handling agents, and rental rebates for shops and cargo agents at Changi Airport. A 15% Property Tax Rebate will also be granted for Changi Airport.\n\n**Food services and retail**\n\n  * The National Environment Agency (NEA) will provide a full month of rental waiver to stallholders in NEA-managed hawker centres and markets.\n  * Other government agencies, like HDB, will provide half a month of rental waiver to its commercial tenants.\n  * To support establishments that operate in private property, a 15% Property Tax Rebate will be granted for qualifying commercial properties. DPM Heng strongly urged landlords to pass this on to their tenants by reducing rentals.\n  * The Ministry of Transport has announced a Point-to-Point Support Package. DPM Heng added: \"I am heartened to know that many taxi and private hire car operators have come out strongly to support the initiative by matching the government\u2019s contribution. This spirit of partnership is what we need to weather this challenging period together.\"\n\n_For more on this, refer to[Annex A of the Budget Speech\n2020](https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/docs/default-\nsource/budget_2020/download/pdf/annexa1.pdf). _\n\n* * *\n\n## Investing in the 'Next Bound of SkillsFuture': One-off credit top-up, mid-\ncareer credit scheme, and more\n\nBudget 2020 will do more to support Singaporeans as they seek to acquire new\nskills in the midst of major structural change in the global economy, through\nthe **Next Bound of SkillsFuture**.\n\nThree key thrusts of the Next Bound of SkillsFuture:\n\n  * Enabling the individual;\n  * Enhancing the role of enterprises in developing their staff; and\n  * Focusing especially on mid-career workers.\n\nIn supporting Singaporeans to continue learning, the government will provide a\n**one-off SkillsFuture Credit top-up of S$500** for every Singaporean aged 25\nyears and above. This top-up will be available for use from 1 October 2020.\nUnlike the earlier S$500 credit which had no expiry date, this top-up will\nexpire in about five years, by end-2025. This is to encourage Singaporeans to\ntake action early to learn new skills, and to make the best use of this period\nof economic slowdown.\n\nThe government will also introduce **a new SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit** ,\nwhich employers can use to defray 90% of out-of-pocket costs of job redesign,\nskills training, and business transformation. It will benefit over 35,000\nenterprises, most of which will be SMEs, and with S$10,000 allocated to each\nenterprise.\n\n![Priya-Feb-2020-Budget-2020-MOF-SkillsFuture-Enterprise-Credit-Scheme-table-\nANNEX-screengrab](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/19125431/Priya-Feb-2020-Budget-2020-MOF-SkillsFuture-\nEnterprise-Credit-Scheme-table-ANNEX-screengrab.jpg)\n\nThe **Productivity Solutions Grant** will also be expanded, to include support\nfor pre-approved job redesign consultancy services.\n\nThe government will also support large anchor enterprises, in training\nefforts; these anchor enterprises are supported by SMEs, and the government\naims to partner with up to 40 of such anchor enterprises to benefit 4,000 SMEs\nover the next five years.\n\nFor mid-career locals currently in their 40s and 50s, the government will\nlaunch a **new SkillsFuture Mid-Career Support Package**. This will:\n\n  * Increase the capacity of reskilling programmes;\n  * Provide a hiring incentive for employers that hire and reskill jobseekers over 40 who have gone through a reskilling programme;\n  * Provide a special SkillsFuture Credit top-up of S$500 for every Singaporean aged 40 to 60 in 2020; and\n  * Allow for peer-level support and career guidance through a group of volunteer Career Advisors.\n\nIn other employability efforts, Budget 2020 will continue to support lifelong\nemployability in Singapore, with a new **Senior Worker Support Package**.\n\nFirst, the Special Employment Credit and Additional Special Employment Credit\nwill be refashioned into a **Senior Employment Credit** , which will take\neffect from 2021. It will provide employers with wage offsets when they hire\nSingaporean workers aged 55 and above, with the support levels tapering down\nover time as the [retirement and re-employment\nages](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/pm-lees-ndr-2019-speech-highlights-\nretirement-re-employment-age-cpf-for-older-workers-to-go-up/) are gradually\nraised.\n\nSecond, when employer CPF contribution rates go up in 2021, employers will\nreceive a **CPF Transition Offset for the year** , to offset half of the\nincrease in employer contributions.\n\nThird, through the **Senior Worker Early Adopter Grant** , the government will\nsupport companies that increase their own retirement and re-employment ages\nbefore legislated changes take place.\n\nFourth, a **part-time re-employment grant** will support and encourage\ncompanies to formalise part-time re-employment provisions.\n\nAdditionally, institutes of higher learning will partner with more enterprises\nto provide real-work settings for local students to learn in, through the\nSkillsFuture Work-Study Programmes. The capacity for these programmes will be\ndoubled by 2025.\n\n_For more on this, refer to[Annex\nB2](https://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/docs/default-\nsource/budget_2020/download/pdf/annexb2.pdf) of the Budget Speech 2020._\n\n* * *\n\n## Reduction in S-Pass holders' ceiling in specific sectors\n\nGiven Singapore\u2019s declining local labour force growth, foreign workers are\nstill a necessary complement, but more opportunities must still be created for\nSingaporeans. In doing so, the government will take further steps this year,\nand will **reduce the S-Pass sub-dependency ration ceiling (DRC) for those in\nthe construction, marine shipyard, and process sectors, from 20% to 15%**.\nThis will be carried out in two phases beginning in January 2021.\n\nHowever, the government will not reduce the S-Pass DRC for the manufacturing\nsector at this point, given economic uncertainties.\n\nThe government will also maintain foreign worker levy rates for all sectors\nfor 2020.\n\n![Priya-Feb-2020-Budget-2020-drc-table-ANNEX-screengrab](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/19130154/Priya-Feb-2020-Budget-2020-drc-table-ANNEX-\nscreengrab.jpg)\n\n* * *\n\n## Support for retirees and persons with disabilities\n\nTo help working seniors with less CPF savings to save more, the government\nwill introduce a **Matched Retirement Savings Scheme** from 2021 to 2025,\nwherein the government will match every dollar of cash top-up made to the CPF\nRetirement Account, capped at S$600 per annum. This will apply to about\n435,000 Singaporeans. Lower, to middle-income Singaporeans aged 55 to 70 who\nhave not been able to set aside the prevailing Basic Retirement Sum will be\neligible.\n\n![Priya-Feb-2020-Budget-2020-MOF-Retirement-Sum-ANNEX-\nscreengrab](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2020/02/19125903/Priya-Feb-2020-Budget-2020-MOF-Retirement-\nSum-ANNEX-screengrab.jpg)\n\nNext, in providing stronger support for employers of persons with disabilities\n(PWDs), the government will introduce the **new Enabling Employment Credit\n(EEC)**. It will be available for five years, from 2021 to 2025, at a cost of\nabout S$31mn annually.\n\nTo ensure that it remains helpful for PWDs to find employment and remain in\nthe workforce, the EEC will be reviewed after two years, with adjustments to\nbe made if necessary and make adjustments if necessary. On this, the MOM will\nprovide more details at the upcoming Committee of Supply debate.\n\n* * *\n\n## Support for enterprises and startups on digitalisation,\ninternationalisation and transformation\n\nThe government will allocate S$8.3bn over the next three years to drive\nSingapore's Transformation and Growth strategy, covering three thrusts:\n\n**Enabling stronger partnerships**\n\nThe first thrust is enabling stronger partnerships \u2013 with the world and within\nSingapore. As a small, open economy, Singapore must continue to **strengthen\npartnerships with the world** , and build new links in new domains. Singapore\nmust also strengthen partnerships to bring good ideas to global markets.\n\nTo make the most of Singapore's global links, **the country must strengthen\npartnerships within itself** to bring good ideas to global markets. **Even as\nenterprises compete to differentiate themselves, they must come together to\nsolve common challenges** , and gain a competitive edge together. Trade\nAssociations and Chambers play an important role in this.\n\n**Deepening enterprise capabilities**\n\nUnder this thrust, the government will support enterprises at each stage of\ntheir growth, to deepen their capabilities. This will be done through\nidentifying business needs; adopting pre-approved digital technologies; and\ntaking the first steps to enter new markets.\n\nTo catalyse investment into deep-tech startups, an additional S$300mn will be\nset aside under the Startup SG Equity. This is expected to draw in more than\nS$800mn of private funding over the next 10 years, and will give deep-tech\nstartups better access to capital, expertise and industry networks.\n\nAside from helping startups, the government will also enhance support for both\nnew and established enterprises through an **Enterprise Grow Package**.

but\nShould](//content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/WORKPLACEV9CMS/xdxfuuigwuo8etukf9nmug.jpg)\n\n#### Story Highlights\n\n  * Among your leaders, CHROs are the least likely to become the next CEO\n  * Few CEOs gain experience in the people part of the organization\n  * Quit cutting CEOs from the same cloth, hire differently\n\nTake a look around your executive table and think about who the next CEO will\nbe.\n\nWill it be the financial leader? The sales and marketing person? The general\ncounsel or the operations director?\n\nThe leader _least_ likely to become the next CEO of the company is the one\nperson your company might just need to take the reins -- the CHRO.\n\nBecause of business trends, [such as tangible assets dropping in market\nvalue](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/259520/needs-succeed-don-yet.aspx), a\ncompany's purpose, culture, and people have become primary assets. All of\nwhich laces HR leaders right in the middle of the action.\n\n> Yet, unlike their peers, CHROs and HR directors are rarely groomed for\n> business leadership.\n\nAnd they often aren't given business experience like other executives -- where\nthey move around to diverse departments -- they instead stay positioned to\nsupport the leaders around them.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, despite the critical need for excellent\npeople-leaders in the C-suite, few leaders are afforded experiential learning\nin human resources. [Few CEOs gain experience in the _people_ part of the\norganization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2011/12/05/the-path-to-\nbecoming-a-fortune-500-ceo/#dc96030709ba).\n\nThis is concerning because when leaders spend their careers without devoting\nany time in HR, they may not establish expertise for why they should -- or how\nto -- value the people (employee and customer) part of the business.\n\nLeading people should not be a reward; it should be a responsibility that\nrequires talent and training. And that training must include expertise in the\nmost important part of any organization -- its people.\n\nLeaders typically (and not always to their fault) don't invest in things they\ndon't value. This can result in:\n\n  * [poor execution of strategy due to less engaged workforces](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231668/dismal-employee-engagement-sign-global-mismanagement.aspx)\n  * [terrible managers due to outdated practices of management](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236396/failed-performance-management-fix.aspx)\n  * [troubling company culture and employee behavior due to a lack of respect from the top down](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/247103/daily-actions-set-tone-workplace-culture.aspx)\n  * [overnight loss of customers due to careless decisions that disrupt trust](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/246194/businesses-worldwide-suffering-trust-crisis.aspx)\n\nInstead, CEOs who put a focus on their company's people and purpose can avoid\nthese pitfalls and build a brand identity that stands apart. _(_[ _Read how\nSchlumberger, the multibillion-dollar global oilfield services company, puts\nan emphasis on HR to develop their\nleaders_](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/258518/schlumberger-develops-\ndiverse-global-leaders.aspx) _ _.__ _)_\n\nThey can create the companies that win the war for talented workers and new\ncustomers -- and, in turn, profit.\n\n**Here 's why HR leaders may be positioned to take on the CEO role more today\nthan ever before:**\n\n### 1\\. They can increase human capital returns during a merger and\nacquisition.\n\n**The problem for CEOs:**\n\n[Mergers and acquisitions are on the\nrise](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/mergers-and-\nacquisitions/articles/ma-trends-\nreport.html?utm_source=link_wwwv9&utm_campaign=item_265886&utm_medium=copy)\n_,_ and human capital becomes even more complicated during this process.\nLeaders need their people to continue at full speed -- and even accelerate --\nto make the M&A successful.\n\nOften during M&As, the numbers look good but, after a short time, workplace\ncultures begin to clash, the company's purpose becomes diluted, and employees\nexperience change fatigue -- and all of this starts to affect the customer\nexperience.\n\n> This failure to manage and motivate employees is one of the reasons that, as\n> _Harvard Business Review_ consistently reports, 70% to 90% of all\n> acquisitions fail to realize their intended benefits.\n\nThis is a great area of opportunity for leaders because only 21% of people (in\nany given organization) believe their performance is managed in a way that\nmotivates them to do outstanding work.\n\nIt's not surprising that most companies struggle in this area when you\nconsider that 82% of managers don't have the right kind of talent to manage\npeople with true excellence.\n\nOr, look at it this way, _leaders_ put processes in place that place people in\nmanagement roles where they don't have the talent to succeed -- this is true\nof more than eight out of 10 managers.\n\n**The opportunity for HR leaders:**\n\nCompanies clearly need to change the way they hire, promote, and develop\nmanagers, and there is no one within the company more equipped to replace the\nbroken practice of management than the people who've invested their careers in\nrecruiting and supporting managers.\n\nManagers with the right talent for the role increase employee engagement and\nperformance simply by being a natural at it.\n\nBut they can achieve even more when they're given the right training and tools\nto do so. They [can create a culture of\naccountability](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/257945/ways-create-company-\nculture-accountability.aspx) and development by shifting from boss to coach\nand by leading [great\nconversations](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/215390/gallup-performance-\nmanagement-ongoing-conversations.aspx) with their teams.\n\n> Only 23% of people feel like they get meaningful feedback from their\n> manager. Only 30% of people are involved in their own goal setting.\n\nIt is really difficult for individuals to hit their goals when just one in\nthree are involved in setting those goals, and three in five aren't getting\nmeaningful feedback about how they are doing.\n\n_It is hard for managers to have those conversations if leaders don 't help\nthem prioritize it._\n\nLeaders need to set managers up for success -- and when those manager-employee\nconversations start happening, it will create an engaging and high-performing\ncompany culture.\n\n### 2\\. They can conquer agility by creating a culture of psychological\nsafety.\n\n**The problem for CEOs:**\n\nOrganization's need to move fast (become more agile) and keep up with\ntechnology to create cutting-edge experiences for their customers.\n\nBut most companies haven't successfully redesigned their key players and\norganizational structure to support the pace that's needed today.\n\nSo, the corporate world has turned into a landscape of too few people wearing\ntoo many hats without the necessary resources, leading to mediocre performance\non everything, rather than superior performance on a few things.\n\n[The most talented superstars in the\nworkforce](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231641/talent-walks-why-best-\nemployees-leaving.aspx) crave the opportunity and autonomy to do superior\nwork, and they will leave a company that lets them run around without a\npurpose and without the opportunity to do their best work.\n\n**The opportunity for HR leaders:**\n\nThis need for speed that drives today's market [can only be obtained with\nfaster decision-making](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/264866/why-strengths-\nbased-workplaces-best-decision-makers.aspx). The days of one or two people\nwithin an organization making all of a company's decisions are over.\n\n> Only one in five European employees are satisfied with the speed of\n> decision-making in their company.\n\nSuccess in the world of agility relies on teams having the capability to make\ndecisions on their own -- that they are allowed to try and fail within\nspecific guidelines and are then given a chance to learn from those failures\nin order to later succeed.\n\n> Only one in four employees in Europe strongly agree their company creates an\n> environment where they can try, fail and learn from their mistakes.\n\nThe lack of autonomy to try, fail, learn and improve is an innovation killer.\n\nMany teams are not willing to make key decisions because they fear the\nconsequences of failure. They play it too safe, while their leaders wish\npeople would bring new ideas and try new things.\n\nThe emotional environments that create psychological safety have been proven\nto foster greater agility.\n\nHowever, most CEOs have been raised on financial or marketing techniques and\nare often not experts in emotional and behavioral techniques that are\nessential if they want their companies to move faster.\n\nThe ability to organize a company and necessary people to form these faster\nteams can only be done by those most familiar with an organization's talent\nand the principles of behavioral economics -- often the CHRO.\n\n### 3\\. They can help their company build trust internally and externally.\n\n**The problem for CEOs:**\n\n[Employees' trust in leadership is\nlow](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/258197/why-leaders-employees-trust-\ndon.aspx):\n\n> Just one in three employees in Gallup's global database strongly agree that\n> they trust the leadership of their organization.\n\nWhen employees don't trust leadership, they also don't plan to stay at their\norganization as long as people who say they do have trust -- and they have\nlittle interest in making a new strategy work or creating new customer\ninitiatives. They don't give leaders the benefit of the doubt.\n\n[And public breaches of trust are\ncommon](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/246194/businesses-worldwide-\nsuffering-trust-crisis.aspx):\n\n_Worldwide, two-thirds of adults say corruption is widespread in business._\n\nStories of corporate misconduct are still rampant and spread quickly. Building\ntrust (reducing breaches) is more important than ever to business\nsustainability and the integrity of a company's brand.\n\nWhether it involves sexual harassment or business ethics, the misconduct\nalways points back to the leadership of a CEO.\n\n**The opportunity for HR leaders:**\n\n**Internally:** Leaders can't build trust with every employee on their own --\nthey need [a network within their\norganization](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/258197/why-leaders-employees-\ntrust-don.aspx). They can build trust by creating a common culture and\ninvesting in the people who have the biggest influence over the majority of\nemployees -- their managers.\n\n**Externally:** Even if a CEO did not commit the crime, they were responsible\nfor the company culture that allowed the actions to occur. There may be little\na CEO has control over when it comes to an individual's actions, but if they\ndon't try, they won't prevent future actions at all.\n\nHaving a leader who doesn't need reminding that something like the #MeToo\nmovement is real, it matters, and it needs to be addressed, is a baseline for\nleadership today -- HR leaders understand this.\n\nHR is perfectly positioned to build trust by building a strong foundation of\nvalues and behaviors -- not just processes and profits.\n\n### Hire Your CEOs Differently -- Don't Cut Them From the Same Cloth\n\nMost CEOs have been cut from the same cloth. But what would happen if they\ncame from a different cloth?\n\nA cloth that gave them people experience and not just process, project\nmanagement and financial experience.\n\nThe people who lead today's organizations need to be more than just a\nfinancial genius or a sales and marketing guru. They need to be someone who\ngets how to run a business _with_ their people and _because_ of their people,\nrather than at the _expense_ of people.\n\nOne simple solution is to give CHROs business experience and give business\nleaders CHRO experience.\n\nThen you have leaders with significant people-leading and people-developing\nexperience who are set up to become future CEOs.\n\nLeading people should not be a reward; it should be a responsibility that\nrequires talent and training.\n\nAnd that training must include expertise in the most important part of any\norganization -- its people.\n\n### **Whether you are currently looking for a new CEO, preparing for the\nfuture or interested in the knowledge CHROs can bring to an organization,\nGallup has some resources that can help:**\n\n  * [Create a winning succession plan](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/215396/gallup-succession-planning.aspx) with Gallup and make the right hiring, promotion and development decisions.\n

And when you\u2019re not sure\nwhat the future holds, that\u2019s a major benefit to hiring managers.\n\n* * *\n\n[_Get access to MoneyShow's 100+ page Top Picks\nReport_](https://news.moneyshow.com/moneyshows-2020-top-stock-picks-\nreport?utm_campaign=2020%20Top%20Picks%20Report&utm_source=email&utm_content=Top%20Pros%20Top%20Picks\n\"https://news.moneyshow.com/moneyshows-2020-top-stock-picks-\nreport?utm_campaign=2020%20Top%20Picks%20Report&utm_source=email&utm_content=Top%20Pros%20Top%20Picks\")\n_  featuring the nation\u2019s most respected and well-known newsletter advisors\nfavorite investment ideas for 2020._\n\n* * *\n\nWe\u2019re also getting close to full employment. And that makes it harder for\ncompanies to find top talent to fill their positions. And surprisingly,\nworkers like the flexibility, too. They can often do the job from anywhere and\nwork on their own time.\n\nThere are over 20,000 staffing companies in the U.S. But there are only one or\ntwo that operate nationwide and have the expertise and the deep talent pool\nmajor companies will be looking for.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a big part of why I like BG Staffing so much. Staffing companies\nget hit harder than most at the onset of a recession. And the stock has been\ngetting beaten down as if we\u2019re already in one. But pretty much all other\nsigns point to a continued economic expansion.\n\nAnother strong point for BGSF is the type of employee the company provides.\nNot only does it help companies find laborers for light industrial work and\ntechnical employees for more skilled tasks (think IT and accounting), but it\nalso helps fill the offices of apartment buildings and residential communities\nacross the country.\n\nIf I\u2019m right and we\u2019re not heading for recession in 2020, then you\u2019ve got the\npotential for at least 30% to 40% growth. And let\u2019s not forget that juicy (and\nwell-covered) 6% dividend, too. This is definitely a stock you can buy and\nhold for a long time.\n\n[**Doug\nGerlach**](https://www.moneyshow.com/expert/e17a2c73f73d4491a608dc29fdadf5e8/douglas-\ngerlach/\n\"https://www.moneyshow.com/expert/e17a2c73f73d4491a608dc29fdadf5e8/douglas-\ngerlach/\"), [**Investor Advisory\nService**](https://www.investoradvisoryservice.com/\n\"https://www.investoradvisoryservice.com/\")\n\nAn increasingly complex legal and regulatory environment makes it difficult\nfor small- and medium-sized businesses to provide the range of employee\nbenefits needed to attract and retain talented staff\n\nIn response, a type of service business called a Professional Employer\nOrganization (PEO) has emerged to provide outsourced employee benefits and\nsolutions. **Insperity, Inc.** **(NSP)** was founded in 1986 and has grown to\nover $4 billion in sales. The company started by focusing on basic PEO\nservices like payroll processing and government compliance.\n\nOver the years Insperity has expanded its services to include a wide variety\nof human resources and employment functions, including health benefits, 401(k)\nplans, employee recruiting, performance management, training, and compensation\nguidance.\n\nInsperity thrives with small firms, generating about three-quarters of its\nsales from businesses with fewer than 100 employees. In this segment the\ncompany can price its services as a percent of the employees\u2019 compensation\nrather than a flat dollar amount per employee.\n\nInsperity continues to grow its co-employment model which essentially takes\nfull ownership of a customer\u2019s employees, handling everything from hiring to\ntermination. Employers are growing more comfortable with this model and\nInsperity earns higher profit margins.\n\nInsperity\u2019s second and third quarters saw slowdowns in sales and signing of\nnew business, and a spike in employee healthcare claims. The share dropped by\na third, as two straight quarters of surprisingly poor performance stunned\ninvestors who had come to expect strong and consistent growth from Insperity.\n\nManagement subsequently expressed confidence that it had trained enough new\nsales representatives heading into the critical fourth quarter selling season,\nand determined that the excess healthcare claims costs it experienced are not\nexpected to repeat.\n\nWhile aware of the risks, the recent price of $80 represents a fairly cheap\nP/E of 19. With our long-term EPS growth expectation at 13.0%, we see NSP as a\nbuy up to $92, with the potential for an annual total return of better than\n21% through 2024.\n\n[**Eddy Elfenbein**](https://www.investorsalley.com/landing/the-top-10-high-\ngrowth-stocks-\nlp/?a=933&utm_campaign=top2020&utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=article&t=gsalandcarr5gtop10grolgforbrpted&cookieUUID=0cea3108-2767-4502-a734-2251596419ac\n\"https://www.investorsalley.com/landing/the-top-10-high-growth-stocks-\nlp/?a=933&utm_campaign=top2020&utm_source=forbes&utm_medium=article&t=gsalandcarr5gtop10grolgforbrpted&cookieUUID=0cea3108-2767-4502-a734-2251596419ac\")\n**,**[ **Growth Stock\nAdvisor**](https://yn345.isrefer.com/go/tms_stks_2020_gro_ed/tms/\n\"https://yn345.isrefer.com/go/tms_stks_2020_gro_ed/tms/\")\n\nThe job at **Paycom Software** **(PAYC)** is to make human-resources\ndepartments more manageable \u2014 and this isn\u2019t so easy in the modern business\nclimate.

Yet despite\nthat big gain, I suspect much more to come from PAYC. One big reason why is\nthat in 2020, I suspect that companies are going to increase their capital\nspending.\n\nNow that the trade tensions between the United States and China have calmed\nsignificantly, and now that the Fed has basically told us that there is very\nlittle likelihood of any interest rate hikes in the year ahead.\n\nIn that environment, companies can invest in the future with a lot more\ncertainty than they had in 2019.

The company\nautomates payroll and other human resources functions.\n\nIt's a stable and profoundly sticky business. Once people convert their\nsystems, they rarely go back . . . retention last year was well above 90%,\nwhich liberates the sales team to chase new accounts instead of keeping\nexisting clients happy.\n\nThat's translated to roughly 30% annualized revenue growth over the years and\nhealthy margins throughout the client cycle. We initially recommended PAYC in\nearly 2018 at $111 so you can see how far it's come. However, as long as there\nare new employers left to capture, that growth curve will continue. And the\nmarket opportunity is endless.\n\n[![MoneyShow](https://blogs-\nimages.forbes.com/moneyshow/files/2019/01/MoneyShow_avatar_1547735939-400x400.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moneyshow/people/moneyshow/\n\"Photo of MoneyShow\")\n\n[MoneyShow](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moneyshow/people/moneyshow/)\n\nMoneyShow \u2014 an industry pioneer in investor education since 1981 \u2014 is a\nglobal, financial media company, operating the world's leading investment and\ntrading conferences.\n\n\u2026\n\n Read More\n\nMoneyShow \u2014 an industry pioneer in investor education since 1981 \u2014 is a\nglobal, financial media company, operating the world's leading investment and\ntrading conferences.

Happily, there are new things to say as he\u2019s become CEO\nof Namely, battling hammer and tongs with BambooHR (having nearly 10 times the\ncustomers) to become the top HCM vendor for small and medium-sized businesses\neverywhere.\n\nProblem is, both Larry and I are \u201centerprise\u201d guys, the term software\ncompanies generally use for customers with 5,000 employees or more and the\nvendors that meet their needs. You\u2019ve most often read me bloviating about the\nBig Three: SAP SuccessFactors, Oracle and Workday. Plus many others, including\nUltimate, Infor, IBM, Cornerstone, ADP, Kronos, Ceridian, ServiceNow and\nstart-ups. But nearly all\u2014except Zenefits\u2014serve big companies.\n\nAnd if you recall from that [May column](http://hrexecutive.com/hr-finally-\ngets-a-robocop/), Larry has only worked for enterprise software companies and\ntheir end users. Plus, he\u2019s almost always been the executive (or No. 2) in\ncharge of products. In many software companies, the CEO\u2019s primary job\u2014despite\nthe title\u2014is to close new sales to generate revenue. Sometimes, the COO or a\npresident actually runs much of the rest of the company. It varies.\n\nSo, after 35 years in HCM, starting right out of college, canny Larry told me\nlong ago that \u201cyou never get to be CEO without having run sales.\u201d Unless\nyou\u2019re the founding geek who manages to hold on, which CEO David Ossip more\nthan did at Ceridian after its private-equity owner bought his company\nWorkforce and put him on top of the whole thing!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nAfter helping David build a great new product suite, Larry eagerly became\nCeridian\u2019s new \u201cchief revenue officer,\u201d a ridiculous new title\u2014CRO\u2014for the\nhead of sales. A likeable guy, experienced manager and very enthusiastic about\ngood products he helped create, he did well.\n\nSo, now he\u2019s CEO of Namely engaged in the most competitive battle in HCM\noutside of the Big Three, and he has zero experience in the SMB space. What\u2019s\nhe gonna do?\n\n\u201cThe same thing I\u2019ve always done,\u201d he says, \u201cshepherd companies from their old\nproducts to their new ones.\u201d\n\nRight. Mainframe vendor Cyborg only had payroll (but what a payroll!) when\nLarry joined, and he helped create its first HRIS. At Lawson, he took HCM off\nits only hardware platform, the IBM AS/400 mini-computer, and created\nclient/server products that ran on anything and eventually in the cloud.\n\nCeridian was still a payroll service bureau when Ossip became CEO. It had\nthree or four payroll engines, at least two front-ends and the usual cluster\nof unintegrated acquired HR software products. Larry and others helped turn it\ninto a software company.\n\nWhat about the flock at Namely? Always straight-talking, Larry says, \u201cThe\ncompany almost never had anyone with HCM domain experience before.\u201d\n\nTrue, until Namely board chair Elisha Steele (also board chair at Cornerstone)\nbecame acting CEO after founder Matt Straz left in May 2018. Getting Larry on\nboard is the culmination of her efforts, which included hiring Erinn Tarpey\nfor marketing after eight years at talent-acquisition vendor iCIMS and Kevin\nThompson for professional services (implementation and customer care) after 15\nyears at Ceridian.\n\nI\u2019m amazed at how little importance is routinely given to HR domain expertise.\nI was hired 30 years ago to start an HR tech magazine without any. Parker\nConrad started Zenefits and raised nearly half a billion dollars without any.\nLots of Valley start-ups pick it up while growing.\n\nAnd growing a business is what Namely\u2019s founder knew how to do\u2014and fast. He\nkept revenue increasing at 40% or more year over year for a while. Largely by\nspending an undisclosed\u2014but I\u2019m sure whopping\u2014portion of the $210 million\ninvestment he attracted to the company on cable news network advertising.\nMaybe radio and other mass market outlets, too, but I never noticed those.\n\nHave you found yourself watching more cable news since the 2016 election? I\u2019ve\nspent so much of my life doing it; I can\u2019t bear to count the hours. But even a\ncasual viewer last year of CNN and MSNBC would have seen dozens and dozens of\nNamely commercials, as well as those for ZipRecruiter, which I did hear on the\nradio, too, making the most outlandish claims: \u201cYou only get qualified\ncandidates!\u201d Perhaps they\u2019re even true.\n\nWhat do you get from untargeted direct-response mass-market advertising?\nThousands and thousands of mostly completely unqualified leads, of course. TV\noffers no way to filter them in advance.\n\nBut, after spending another huge chunk of change sifting through them and\nselling to the good ones, Namely ended up with 1,400 paying customers, a solid\nnumber for a company officially only seven years old. And an estimated yearly\nrevenue approaching $75 million, though Larry won\u2019t say at all. (Some friend!)\nPlus, good name recognition among news junkies.\n\nThe customers are small businesses\u201425 to 500 employees each\u2014with the usual\nlarge outlier every non-enterprise vendor has, and Namely\u2019s big hitter has\n3,500 employees. Larry says the company\u2019s sweet spot is 50 to 300 employees,\nwhich happens to be the low end of ADP\u2019s 200,000-plus Major Accounts\ncustomers. Few ever talk about them and Paychex when considering the viability\nof the raft of HCM SMB newcomers. They get labeled \u201clegacy\u201d vendors, as though\nthey don\u2019t count anymore, or often have a solid grip on their customers.\n\nLike ADP, and unlike BambooHR, Namely customers are offered all the modern HCM\nessentials: HR, talent management, payroll, benefits, time and attendance. The\nfirst two are bundled; the rest (and more) are sold separately.\n\nNamely didn\u2019t acquire payroll functionality until 2014, buying a company named\nTrax. But it quickly learned\u2014just like Silicon Valley\u2019s current HCM start-up\ndarling, Gusto, did with its 100,000 truly tiny payroll clients\u2014what ADP knew\nin 1949: Companies want to buy payroll first! Fully 75% of Namely\u2019s customers\nhave bought payroll, in addition to HR.\n\nGusto is struggling to add HR functionality (adding pieces around the edges),\nwhile going the same benefits route pioneered (and now abandoned) by Zenefits\nand also offered by Namely: employing certified brokers selling health\ninsurance for various carriers state by state to customers.\n\nThe legal complications being the broker of record abound, but customers like\nthe one-stop shopping, when accompanied by a good analysis of current coverage\nand expert guidance for changing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nSmall companies have always been desperate for HR advice, particularly on\nlegal and compliance issues, because many don\u2019t hire an HR professional until\nreaching 100 employees, by which time they have broken dozens of state and\nfederal regulations. They should hire one at 50 but think they can\u2019t justify\nthe expense.\n\nNamely offers them \u201cmanaged services,\u201d basically offering a human and tech HR\nfunction. There is HR advice for the boss (Don\u2019t hire your relatives over\nprotected classes of candidates!) and experts to answer employees\u2019 questions.\nLarry says it\u2019s full-service enough to have lured some customers away from\ntheir PEO providers.\n\nDoing everything for the customers includes implementation. Too many SMB\nvendors think their software is so intuitive (or so minimally configurable)\nthat customers can implement it themselves. Or with a couple of phone calls.\nSure, if they\u2019ve got 10 employees.\n\nWhile Larry may brag that the HR module alone can be implemented in just two\ndays at a 200-employee customer, he knows that a full suite can easily take\n200 hours, and Namely remains responsible for 75% of that work.\n\nLooking ahead, Larry thinks Namely will win on its HR product bundle and user\nand mobile experiences. But his battle in this SMB coliseum presents a\nchallenge he\u2019s never faced before as an enterprise guy: customer \u201cchurn.\u201d\n\nAfter spending 18 months implementing software, big companies tend to stick\nwith it through good times and bad, weathering their own bad economic patches.\nBut small companies\u2014while their numbers seem to be endless and guesses vary at\nmore than 2 million in the U.S.\u2014go out of business or get acquired at an\nalarming rate!\n\nBeing CRO as well as CEO means replacing a lot of them every year before\nadding the first new one counting as yearly growth. Think Larry should start\nadvertising on Fox instead?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Share this article!\n\nClick to Copy\n\n[__Share](https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fnamely-\ngrabs-new-ceo%2F)\n\n[\n__Tweet](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Bill+Kutik%3A+Namely+grabs+new+CEO%21&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fnamely-\ngrabs-new-ceo%2F&via=hrexecmag)\n\n[\n__Share](https://www.linkedin.com/cws/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhrexecutive.com%2Fnamely-\ngrabs-new-ceo%2F)\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  1.

10:09am\n\n_**Software investor Hg has made an investment in Personal & Informatik AG\n(P&I), a provider of cloud-based HR software, headquartered in Germany,\nacquiring the holding from funds advised by Permira, the global private equity\nfirm, for an enterprise value of EUR2 billion. **_\n\nPermira funds remain invested in P&I with a substantial minority stake. The\ntransaction will represent the 4th investment from the Hg Saturn 1 Fund, which\nhad its first close in early 2018 and focuses on software businesses with\nenterprise values of more than GBP1 billion. Hg managed funds will become the\nmajority shareholder in the business.  \n  \nHg is a serial investor in the regulatory driven software space and continues\nto see attractive, long-term growth for leading and innovative players in the\nsector. P&I represents the 6th company focused on HR software in Hg\u2019s current\nportfolio, alongside Visma, IRIS, Access Group, Citation Group and Allocate\nSoftware. These 6 HR software companies currently total over EUR14 billion of\nenterprise value within the wider Hg portfolio of 33 software and services\ncompanies.  \n  \nThe Permira funds have a long track record of successfully investing in\ntechnology companies around the world and have deployed around EUR10 billion\nin the sector since 1997. Current portfolio companies in that sector include\nTeamViewer, Informatica, Klarna, Genesys, LegalZoom and Allegro, amongst\nothers.  \n  \nFounded in 1968, P&I is an internationally operating, full suite provider of\ncloud-based HR software solutions and a driver of innovation in HR technology.\nP&I\u2019s scalable subscription-based platform exhibits characteristics that\nresonate with Hg Saturn\u2019s core focus, with a broad, diversified and loyal\ncustomer base, and has delivered exceptional historical operating performance,\nwith over 10 years of consistent revenue and EBITDA growth. The company has\nsignificantly extended its R&D capabilities over the past few years, which\nincludes the opening of a new R&D hub in Greece in 2017.\n\nAs a result, P&I developed and successfully introduced an integrated Software-\nas-a-Service (SaaS) platform allowing HR tasks to be managed in the most\nmodern, efficient and fastest manner, delivering strong value to its customers\nand a truly differentiated experience to its users. P&I\u2019s new sales force\nstructure has grown its customer base to more than 15,000 end customers,\nranging from small- and medium-sized private businesses (SMB) to large\nenterprises and public sector organisations of all sizes, mainly in Germany,\nSwitzerland and Austria (DACH region).  \n  \nJustin von Simson, Managing Partner at Hg, says: \u201cP&I is an exceptional\nbusiness and we\u2019ve been in the privileged position of knowing the team there\nfor almost two decades. Since our first investment in P&I in 2013 we remain\nimpressed by the quality and long-term vision of the business and its\nmanagement team. We\u2019re excited to partner with P&I and its team again and\nsupport them in the next phase of growth.\u201d  \n  \nMichael Biehl, Director in Hg Saturn, and Carlo Pohlhausen, Principal at Hg,\nsays: \u201cHR software is a core sector for us at Hg and P&I is one of the\nEuropean leaders in this field, enabling thousands of customers to simplify\nand automate HR tasks through its innovative cloud technology. We\u2019re delighted\nto support the business on its path of becoming a true European HR cloud\nchampion.\u201d  \n  \nVasilios Triadis, CEO P&I, adds: \u201cWe believe that, together with our well-\nknown partner Hg, we will be well positioned to write the next chapter of\nP&I\u2019s success story. The Hg team with its extensive knowledge of P&I and the\nsoftware sector is the perfect partner to back us on our future growth\ntrajectory. At the same time we want to thank the Permira funds for their\nsupport in further strengthening our leadership position in the European HR\nsoftware market. We are very happy about their continuous commitment which\nshows a strong confidence in our growth plans.\u201d  \n  \nJ\u00f6rg Rockenh\u00e4user, Partner and Head of DACH at Permira, says: \u201cFollowing the\nrecent listing of TeamViewer in Germany, the sale of P&I marks another\nsuccessful software transaction for Permira, Europe\u2019s leading technology\ninvestor. Over the past years, the Permira funds have supported the P&I\nmanagement in expanding the business across the German-speaking region and in\nsignificantly investing in R&D and product innovation. The Permira funds\ncontinue to see huge growth potential in P&I and remain invested with a\nsubstantial minority stake.\u201d  \n  \nStefan Dziarski, Partner at Permira, says: \u201cWith the launch of the new\nSoftware as a Service product, P&I has been transformed into one of the most\ninnovative subscription-based SaaS platforms in the Human Resources segment.\nToday, the company is a technology leader in the HR software market and is\nideally positioned for future growth in Europe.\"\n\nAuthor Profile\n\nTags\n\n[Deals &

Voice, for instance, is the future of employee-application\ninteraction, Leone said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the way we expect to interact with\nothers, so why not bring that to software?\u201d\n\nThe new features derive from Oracle\u2019s overall application strategy,\ncharacterized by voice recognition through a mobile interface, an intuitive\nand pervasive digital assistant, and a recommendation engine whose machine\nlearning algorithms allow it to constantly improve.\n\nAlong with voice, Oracle\u2019s HCM digital assistant can understand SMS texts and\nemails. Users can also access it via home voice-command devices. The digital\nassistant\u2019s natural language processing and ML algorithms help it learn the\n\u201cintent\u201d behind words and phrases and provide help sorting out resumes or\noffer recommendations and next steps during interactions with employees.\n\nFor example, the digital assistant will give employees quick answers to such\ncommon questions as \u201cWho is my HR rep?\u201d and \u201cWhat are my benefits?\u201d It also\nwill remind employees to complete HR processes, such as performance reviews,\nand offer \u201cprompts\u201d about potential career moves, said Kai Petzelt, an Oracle\nvice president of product marketing, in a separate presentation at Oracle\nOpenWorld.\n\nJob candidates will be able to submit their applications using the digital\nassistant, import data into the Oracle recruiting app from LinkedIn, and ask\nquestions about career options and benefits coverage\u2014\u201ca human-centric set of\nquestions that allow [applicants] to experience what it will be like to work\nat this company,\u201d Leone said.\n\n**\u2018More Personalized Experience\u2019**\n\nBut an AI-powered digital assistant isn\u2019t the only way to bolster the\neffectiveness of HR organizations and processes. \u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re\nfocused on is providing a much more personalized experience for every\nemployee, every worker within the enterprise,\u201d Leone said.\n\nFor example, Oracle\u2019s recently introduced Experience Design Studio, part of\nits HCM Cloud suite, is a \u201cnon-coding environment\u201d that lets HR business\nmanagers create \u201cconditional rules\u201d\u2014the processes or transactions that an\nemployee is allowed to be involved in\u2014tailored to that employee\u2019s country,\nbusiness unit, and role in the organization. And it lets them create \u201cevent-\nbased business processes\u201d that kick off the next set of HR tasks after a\nsignificant change, such as when an employee gets married.\n\nCareer mobility is of increasing importance to today\u2019s workforce\u2014and to every\nforward-looking employer looking to head off a looming labor shortage and\nbrain drain. It\u2019s why Oracle HCM Cloud is being modernized to focus on\n\u201cenabling employers to provide an environment where their employees understand\nwhat their future selves look like,\u201d Leone said.\n\nHe demonstrated a new Oracle HCM Cloud application called Connections, running\non the company\u2019s redesigned mobile user interface known as Redwood. Resembling\na combination search engine and mapping system, it lets employees \u201cfind people\nin the organization that are like them,\u201d Leone said.\n\nUsing Connections with the HCM digital assistant and its predictive search\ncapability, workers can explore their organization by way of a variety of\ncategories\u2014skills, departments, people, geography\u2014in order to find a new job\nor just \u201cfind someone they want to connect with,\u201d he said.\n\nLeone noted that a company\u2019s HR system is \u201creally the only enterprise system\nthat touches every single employee\u201d and, as such, is an ideal place to start\ndriving AI and other technology innovations throughout the organization.\n\n[![John Soat](https://blogs-images.forbes.com/oracle/files/2019/09/John-\nSoat_avatar_1568914728-400x400.jpg)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/people/johnsoat/\n\"Photo of John Soat\")\n\n[John Soat](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/people/johnsoat/)\n\nJohn Soat is an award-winning journalist who has been writing about\ninformation technology for more than 25 years.\n\n  * Print\n  * [Site Feedback](mailto:feedback@forbes.com)\n  * [Tips](https://www.forbes.com/tips/)\n  * [Corrections](mailto:corrections@forbes.com?subject=Report Correction: John Soat&body=Reporting Correction for: %0A %0A Title: Smart Technology Provides A More Personal Approach To HR %0A Author: John Soat %0A URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/oracle/2019/10/15/smart-technology-provides-a-more-personal-approach-to-hr/%0A %0A - %0A %0A Your Name: %0A Correction Request: %0A %0A - %0A %0A Thank you for reporting a correction.

Instead of looking at\nthe target audience as a homogenous whole, companies segment buyers into\ngroups with common traits, challenges, and desires. This helps in\npersonalizing the marketing message so that it resonates with each group (or\npersona) on an individual level.\n\nSimilarly, employee personas can help tailor internal experiences for target\nuser groups. Essentially, employee personas can be defined as a reflection of\nemployee groups who share common features \u2013 just like customers do. A persona\nmust try to capture as many details as possible in a way that enables simple\non-ground execution of employee experience strategies. For example, employee\npersonas can be created by assessing:\n\n  * The age group, education, and tenure of the employee\n  * Their years of experience\n  * Their career progression over the year\n  * Their stated career goals\n  * Their feedback from[ ](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-an-employee-engagement-survey-definition-process-vendors-examples/)[employee engagement surveys](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/pulse-surveys-vs-annual-surveys-which-is-a-better-measure-of-employee-engagement/)\n  * How often they have switched jobs\n  * Their performance metrics showing their career development\n  * Challenges in the workplace  \n\nThese data points, in addition to anything more relevant to your company\nculture, can be used to create various employee personas. You can then\nsuitably personalize the [candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/) or\nthe employee experience. For instance, recruiters can adopt a proactive, hand-\nholding strategy if the candidate is a high-energy introvert.\n\n**Learn More:[Rethinking the Employee Experience in Human-Centric\nWorkplaces](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/rethinking-the-employee-experience-in-humancentric-workplaces/)**\n\n## **Three Benefits of Creating Employee Personas**\n\nCarefully designed personas offer several benefits. These include:\n\n### **1\\. Increased empathy**\n\nEmployee personas allow you to accurately visualize how an employee\nexperiences the workplace. Given the fact that most [HR teams need to\nundertake employee journey\nmapping](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/why-your-\nhr-team-needs-employee-journey-mapping/), you can conduct a walkthrough of the\nemployee journey guided by the persona, making changes according to the\nemployee\u2019s unique point of view.\n\n### **2\\. Streamlined attention**\n\nIn the modern workplace, new policies, workflows, or technologies shouldn\u2019t be\nimplemented with a one-size-fits-all model. Employee personas help to avoid\nthis common pitfall by segmenting the workforce into targetable and manageable\ngroups.\n\n### **3\\. Easier leadership buy-in**\n\nEmployee personas are a tangible representation of workforce needs, pain\npoints, and opportunities. They can be showcased to business leaders to obtain\nbuy-in for new solutions, demonstrating why they are necessary for a sizeable\nemployee group.\n\nSo how can go about constructing an employee persona document? It all starts\nwith data, supported by analysis and reviews.\n\n**Learn More:[Why Personalization is the Future of the Employee\nExperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/why-\npersonalization-is-the-future-of-the-employee-experience/)**\n\n## **Four Steps to Effective Employee Persona Creation**\n\nLeading companies are leveraging employee personas to optimize specific\nprojects, experiences, and workplace initiatives.\n\nFor any large-scale HR initiative, such as designing a company-wide learning\nand development (L&D;) program, creating employee personas is essential.\nHere\u2019s how the process should look:\n\n### **Step 1. Gather both qualitative and quantitative data**\n\nEmployee surveys can extract valuable data into the initiatives\u2019 efficacy.\nDatasets should cover both qualitative and quantitative information to present\nan accurate picture.\n\nFor instance, when developing an L&D; program for employees, quantitative data\nwould include the number of courses they have successfully completed as adult\nlearners in the past. Qualitative data may include their feedback on various\nlearning modes \u2013 audio, video, classroom, and so on.\n\nAI tools such as natural language processing can help condense these findings\ninto actionable data points, revealing employee sentiment that can be used to\ndesign the employee experience.\n\n### **Step 2. Complement internal data with market research**\n\nThis step is crucial to the employee persona creation process. Market research\nwill add valuable insights into how workers respond to specific scenarios and\nbehave when faced with experiential triggers.\n\nFor instance, you could use historical external data on how employees reacted\nwhen major external changes \u2013 such as the global economic recession \u2013\noccurred. Did employees who had transferrable skills suffer a minor blow in\ncomparison to their less-skilled counterparts?\n\nThe research stage could also include focus group testing, where you can\nsimulate the experience you want to deliver to a small target group of\nemployees to study their response. These groups could be made up of\nindividuals outside your organization with the same demographic and\neducational profile as your own employees.\n\n### **Step 3. Identify similarities and differences**\n\nThis is where analytics comes in. By passing the datasets through a powerful\nanalytics engine, you can create employee clusters with shared attributes.\nThese will include personality traits, productivity and performance metrics,\nprofessional and personal goals, as well as workplace challenges. This forms\nthe basis of the final employee persona library.\n\n### **Step 4. Incorporate basic HRIS data and obtain validation**\n\nNext, HRIS systems can add operational data such as age, designation, past\nwork experience, internal career progression, and time with the company to\nsignificantly enrich datasets. These data points contribute significantly to\nthe employee profile and help group them into target groups.\n\nAt this stage, you should be able to spot clear patterns in employee personas\nand their workplace experiences/behavior.\n\nFinally, another round of focus group tests can help validate the assumptions\nyou have made about the persona of a group of employees.\n\n**Learn More:[Tips on Creating a Differentiated Employee\nExperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/tips-\non-creating-a-differentiated-employee-experience/)**\n\n### **The Way Forward: How Tech Could Make Employee Personas Meaningful**\n\nWhile you could possibly create the entire employee persona manually and in-\nhouse, there are several solutions out there to simplify the task.\n\nAnalytics company [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/) offers several\nsolutions that could help in this area, like Stats iQ \u2013 a ready-to-use\nplatform for identifying data correlations and converting these correlations\ninto rich visualizations. Qualtrics also has a full suite of data collection\naids, including 360-degree feedback software and pulse surveys that contribute\nto the development of employee personas.\n\nAnother useful solution to consider is from [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/), a\nbusiness content provider. Xtensio offers an in-depth user persona template\nthat can be customized to meet any HR team\u2019s employee persona needs. It also\nsupports interactive modules for customizable persona document layouts, as\nwell as built-in collaboration.\n\nAs [employee experience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-experience-and-how-to-improve-it/) becomes a top\npriority for any future-focused organization, personas will take centerstage\nwhen redesigning workflows for maximum impact. By conducting adequate\nresearch, gathering comprehensive data from the market, and investing in the\nright tools, you can ensure that employees\u2019 workplace experiences are\nperfectly tailored to their individual needs.\n\nAnd, employee personas will play a critical role in this all-new experiential\nworkplace ecosystem.\n\n_Are you using technology to create employee personas at your organization?_\n_Share your insights with us on_[\n_Facebook_](https://www.facebook.com/HRTechnologist/) _,_[\n_LinkedIn_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hr-technologist/) _, or_[\n_Twitter_](https://twitter.com/_hrtechnologist?lang=en?) _.

The skills\ngap is getting wider. People are beginning to prioritize workplace culture,\nemployee benefits, and corporate social responsibility of an organization over\nsalary. Finding talent to meet the skills gap is becoming more challenging.\nThere\u2019s a lot in the air to fuel any underlying fears an HR professional may\nhave. Let\u2019s look at some of the biggest fears that are haunting HR this\nHalloween, and any possible solutions.\n\n## **Is the Fear of AI the Biggest Fear of Them All? Apparently, Yes!**\n\nOur assessment tells us that AI taking over jobs is HR\u2019s top fear. But that\u2019s\nnot all. There are more very real fears, but also ways to handle them.\n\n![HR leaders tell us about some of their fears about the future of work. Do\nthese fears trouble you too?](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n_**Fig 1. HR leaders tell us about some of their fears about the future of\nwork. Do these fears trouble you too?**_\n\n### **1\\. The robot apocalypse**\n\n  \nIt is no surprise that the fear of robots taking over our jobs is the number\none fear among HR and the workforce in general.\n\n**Steve Hatfield, Deloitte Consulting principal and global future of work\nleader,** tells us, \u201cThe biggest fear regarding the future of work is \u2018the\nrobot apocalypse and the end of jobs!\u2019 which alas often is the story in the\nmedia.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve heard so much about the fear of AI taking over and leaving us without\njobs that for HR \u2013 which may be facing this fear themselves \u2013 the pressure is\nhigh to [help employees overcome the fear of\nAI](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-hr-can-\nhelp-employees-overcome-their-fears-of-ai/) and automation as well.\n\n\u201cIt is true that AI and automation will change the nature of work and shift\nthe demand for the types of skills needed in the future,\u201d adds Hatfield,\nconfirming that automated jobs are indeed the future.\n\nBut he also offers advice on how to deal with this fear: \u201cWe often ask our HR\nclients to \u2018own the narrative\u2019 on the future of work and shape a better, more\naccurate message.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith AI and robotics starting to take over repetitive tasks, the workforce\nwill have the opportunity to learn new skills, and organizations will bring\nlearning into the flow of work and make it a continuous process, so workers\nwill have opportunities to develop skills to stay relevant.\u201d\n\nThis, of course, will require that HR and the workforce alike cast aside their\nfears and ensure that they use the opportunities that the large-scale\nautomation of tasks is set to create. Hatfield further adds: \u201cFinally,\norganizations will become more team-based, more agile and more open,\nreceptive, and adaptable to changing technology. With these rapid\nadvancements, a world of opportunity opens to us, which, I believe, will\nstymie future fears of the ever-evolving workforce.\u201d\n\n**Learn More:**[ **AI and the Future of Work Heading into\n2020**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/ai-and-\nthe-future-of-work-heading-into-2020/)\n\n### **2\\. A loss of creativity and the human element**\n\n  \n**Nicole Stevens, head of people and development, Access Partnership,** a\nglobal public policy consultancy for the tech sector, agrees with Hatfield\u2019s\nview but also shares a very real concern: \u201cI see a lot of opportunity for AI\nin HR, from managing low-level tasks to enhancing onboarding and recruitment\nprocesses. However, HR deals with people, not products, and so we need to be\nvery careful about how we use it.\u201d\n\nStevens warns HR about a loss of creativity and the human element. Are we\nbecoming zombies, working mindlessly while AI enables a high level of\ndecision-making for us?\n\n\u201cAs much as we want the ideal scenario where decisions are data-driven and\nprocess automated, does this mean that the decision is necessarily the best\none?\u201d asks Stevens. \u201cDo we risk losing the creative element? If we are\nanalyzing keystrokes, time on the phone, and computer activity to measure\nproductivity or motivation and using AI to onboard employees, we are removing\nthe human element and are at risk of treating people like robots with the\nattendant decrease in morale and quality of life.\u201d\n\n**Charles Bendotti, senior vice president, people & culture at Philip Morris\nInternational (PMI), agrees, **stating that the organization already uses\ntechnology and AI to a great extent to build their products. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2026 using AI\nand robotics to improve our processes and exploring its use in our hiring\npractices, talent attraction efforts, and insecurity. Nevertheless, the\nimportance of human creativity should not be forgotten. This inspires new\nideas, ways of working and thinking to drive meaningful change. For us, the\nfuture relies on innovation, not just automation.\u201d\n\n**Learn More:**[ **How Artificial Intelligence is Humanizing\nHR**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/how-\nartificial-intelligence-is-humanizing-hr/)\n\n### **3\\. The inability to find quality talent**\n\n  \n**Jonathan Finkelstein, CEO of Credly,** a digital credentials platform,\nmentions that \u201cAt a time when the reported cost of making an incompatible hire\nis 20% of the position\u2019s annual salary, HR professionals feel the pressure to\nmake the right decisions for their teams. Traditionally, hiring approaches\nhave relied heavily on unverified information, gut instincts, and best\nguesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile concerns are rising about the potential for AI bias in recruitment\nprocesses and more generally regarding workforce displacement as a result of\nautomation, the biggest challenge ahead for HR is likely in recruiting and\nretaining the talent necessary to meet the demands of the Fourth Industrial\nRevolution,\u201d says **Terry (Terence) Toland, an associate in the Global\nBusiness Policy Council of A.T. Kearney,** a global strategy and management\nconsulting firm, and co-author of the report, [Resilience, Replacement, and\nRenewal](https://www.atkearney.com/web/global-business-policy-council/global-\ntrends-2019-2024?).\n\nHe adds, \u201cA.T. Kearney\u2019s 2019 [Views from the\nC-Suite](https://www.atkearney.com/web/global-business-policy-council/views-\nfrom-the-c-suite/2019) survey of global executives found that technical and\ntechnological skills are the most difficult to obtain in the talent pool\u2014and\nthat these skills will only grow more important over the next five years.\u201d\n\nUpskilling your workforce, like Amazon has planned to do by 2025, maybe one\nway to help fill the skills gap from within.\n\nFinkelstein adds, \u201cIn the future of work, digital credentials lighten that\nburden by providing the full context of what prospective employees can\nactually do and how those abilities fit into the entire team structure.\u201d\n\n### **4\\. Bias in AI**\n\n  \nThe topic of bias in AI has been discussed extensively, and it should be,\nconfirms **Bhushan Sethi, joint global leader, people, and organization,\nprincipal, PwC United States** : \u201cThe fear about AI is real \u2013 whether it be\nbiased data sets, manipulations of algorithms or an overreliance on machine-\nbased decisions. In fact, [53% of\nworkers](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/upskilling.html) believe automation\nwill significantly change or make their job obsolete within the next ten\nyears.\u201d\n\nHe also says that this is something that can be managed with strategic\nplanning: \u201cCompanies can play a role in managing these fears head-on with the\nright level of communications, data governance, controls and upskilling. These\nefforts will be critical to \u2018scale\u2019 the use of AI in augmenting people-based\ndecisions.\u201d\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Can AI Eliminate Bias in\nHiring?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/can-\nartificial-intelligence-eliminate-bias-in-hiring/)\n\n## **The Future May Be Uncertain, but It Has the Potential to Be Promising**\n\nIs AI the modern-day Frankenstein\u2019s monster? Not if we learn how to use it\nstrategically.

The flexibility of\nNPL also translates into savings on search and recruitment costs for SIA, and\nnot having to train new hires from scratch when activity subsequently picks\nup.\n\nThis will permit SIA to be nimble and respond proactively to any changes in\ndemand and operational needs.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, the initiative also allows SIA cabin crew\nwho volunteer for NPL to make use of the downtime to, say, tap their\nSkillsFuture credits and upskill themselves with self-improvement courses, or\nto simply take some well-deserved time off to attend to their families and\npersonal circumstances.\n\nThey would be energised and ready for work when activity and demand\nsubsequently pick up again.\n\n> **In the current challenging economic climate, with business conditions\n> fluid and in constant flux, carefully calibrated human resource management\n> solutions such as voluntary no-pay leave could be valuable tools for\n> managing costs and excess capacity.**\n\nIn the current challenging economic climate, with business conditions fluid\nand in constant flux, carefully calibrated HRM solutions such as NPL could be\nvaluable tools for managing costs and excess capacity, and provide a company's\nmost valued resources - its employees - with much needed flexibility and\ncustomised work experiences.\n\n**Woon Wee Min**\n\nA version of this article appeared in the print edition of The Straits Times\non February 29, 2020, with the headline 'Strategic HR solutions valuable in\ntough economic times'.

In their popular 2018 book [_Talent\nWins_](https://store.hbr.org/product/talent-wins-the-new-playbook-for-putting-\npeople-first/10003), former McKinsey global managing director [Dominic\nBarton](https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/dominic-barton) and his\ncoauthors urge every aspiring CEO to gain serious HR experience and every\ncorporate board to spend significant time on talent issues. Likewise, Ellie\nFiller of the consulting firm Korn Ferry and Dave Ulrich of the University of\nMichigan have found that [CEOs\u2019 relevant traits](https://hbr.org/2014/12/why-\nchief-human-resources-officers-make-great-ceos) are more closely matched with\nthose of Chief Human Resources Officers (CHROs) than with those of any other\nC-Suite position. CHROs, they suggest, should be considered when selecting\nCEOs.\n\nThis war for talent should be great news for women, because women dominate HR.\nIn the US, there is also a much higher percentage of women of color in HR than\nin any other corporate department.\n\nOverall, despite advances, women still account for only about [10% of top\nexecutive positions](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/30/women-\nscarce-at-top-of-u-s-business-and-in-the-jobs-that-lead-there/) in US\ncorporations. Only [4% of C-Suite leaders](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-\ninsights/gender-equality/women-in-the-workplace-2019) are women of color. In\nHR, by contrast, women are actually [in the\nmajority](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-\nbusiness/careers/leadership-lab/where-are-all-the-men-in-hr/article35586114/):\n73% of HR managers, and 55% of CHROs. Roughly one-third of US HR professionals\n[identify as non-\nwhite](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/228948/Diversity%20Report%202018.pdf),\nand more than 10% of Fortune 100 CHROs are women of color.\n\nSo we have our solution to the women\u2019s leadership gap, right?\n\nNot so fast. The [groundbreaking McKinsey\nstudy](https://www.fastcompany.com/34512/war-talent) that predicted talent\nwould be the most valuable corporate resource \u2013 and in short supply \u2013 was\npublished more than 20 years ago. Growing appreciation for the value of talent\nhas not been matched by growing appreciation for the value of HR. Despite\nefforts at rebranding (as \u201cPeople,\u201d \u201cEmployee Experience,\u201d or simply\n\u201cTalent\u201d), HR\u2019s reputation as a functional backwater persists. CHROs may have\na seat at the table, but that seat\u2019s occupant is still [least likely to become\nCEO](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/265886/why-leaders-become-ceo.aspx).\n\n[](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/gwrz2sy?utm_source=on-\nsite&utm_medium=message&utm_campaign=readersurvey&utm_post-date=03-24-20&)\n![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==)\n\n_Project Syndicate_ is conducting a short reader survey. As a valued reader,\nyour feedback is greatly appreciated.\n\nTake Survey\n\nMoreover, HR leaders are paid far less than their C-Suite peers, indicating\nthat they are valued far less. According to the Chief Executive Group, CHROs\nat public companies earn [less than\n10%](https://www.workforce.com/news/despite-pay-hike-chros-still-trail-fellow-\nc-suite-execs-salaries) of what their C-level counterparts earn.\n\nIn short, human capital is highly valued, but the people in charge of human\nresources are not. One likely reason is that HR professionals are viewed as\nlacking business acumen. There is some merit to this perception. A historical\nfocus on functions like employee relations and benefits administration has\nleft HR with a reputation for straddling the line between risk-averse and\nmundane, hardly the function you\u2019d want to lead innovative and forward-looking\nefforts that might determine the fate of the business. And relatively low pay\nhas made it harder for HR \u2013 a [rare path](https://hbr.org/2008/07/why-did-we-\never-go-into-hr) for graduates of top business schools \u2013 to attract top\ntalent.\n\nHR is also the functional embodiment of \u201c[office\nhousework](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/opinion/sunday/sheryl-sandberg-\nand-adam-grant-on-women-doing-office-housework.html/).\u201d It is a discipline\nthat has been asked to manage the lion\u2019s share of hard-to-measure\nadministrative tasks that advance the business but not the careers of those\nwho perform them. It\u2019s not surprising, then, that CEOs are only too happy to\nincrease diversity (marginally) by hiring women, including a large number of\n[women of color](https://hbr.org/2018/04/women-of-color-get-asked-to-do-more-\noffice-housework-heres-how-they-can-say-no), for the housework job, one that\nrequires lots of focus on messy relationships among employees. And, like all\nother professions dominated by women, it is then paid less and valued less.\nUnder-resourced and inundated with transactional work, HR leaders have\nhistorically struggled to perform the strategic work now demanded of them.\n\nThe good news is that HR\u2019s role is changing. For starters, it is much more\nquantitative. People analytics, [popularized](https://www.workrules.net/) by\nformer Google executive Laszlo Bock, is now an established tool, and HR\ndepartments routinely hire data scientists to inform critical business\ndecisions. In addition, the HR tech field has exploded, creating an ecosystem\nof [more than 4,000 software providers](https://joshbersin.com/2019/12/hr-\ntechnology-market-2020-report-now-available/) catering to HR professionals.\nThis evolution, along with a trend toward outsourcing benefits administration,\nis fundamentally reshaping the HR function.\n\nBut when more technology and data are involved, requiring more quantitative\nskills, CEOs turn to men. Instead of tapping into the talent pool of women in\nHR, business leaders are [tilting\n](https://www.hcamag.com/au/specialisation/corporate-wellness/10-hr-trends-\nfor-2015/142228)toward hiring \u201cstrategic\u201d HR executives from non-HR\nbackgrounds. Job descriptions for HR leadership roles increasingly cite\n\u201cbusiness acumen\u201d as a necessary prerequisite.\n\nOther companies have responded to a perceived talent gap in the HR field by\ntaking pieces of the function and distributing them to other, male-dominated\nfunctions: payroll and benefits to the CFO, analytics to the CTO, software\nsystems to the CIO, and so on.\n\nBringing fresh talent into the HR field and increasing cross-functional\ninvolvement in and support for HR is not all bad. It could mean more resources\ndevoted to HR, more attention paid to what HR leaders actually do, and more\ncompetition for top HR roles. But it could also mean that we squander an\nopportunity to recognize the talent that already exists among HR leaders who\nhave been systematically undervalued, and to empower and upskill the existing\nHR talent pool.\n\nLast August, the US Business Roundtable\n[announced](https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-\nthe-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans)\nits members\u2019 intention to pursue \u201can economy that serves all Americans.\u201d\nCentral to that vision is an investment in fostering diverse and inclusive\nworkforces.\n\nAs talent takes center stage, and as [stakeholder\ncapitalism](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stakeholder-\ncapitalism-new-metrics-by-klaus-schwab-2019-11) gains momentum, women in HR,\nthe most diverse function in corporate America, are poised to rise.

The appoint of a CEO has\nnever been based on a talent match but rather on real power wielded. Since the\ndawn of business, the single biggest power force in any business has been\ncustomers and not talent. Hence, 90% of CEO's are normally the previous\ndivision manager with the most customers or biggest growth in customers. 10%\nof the time someone from the support function gets appointed but this is\nnormally in response to a major fiasco and is a clean up exercise. Normally\nthese forays have terrible results because the relationship with the customer\nis severed and they leave, causing a severe drop in revenue, followed by mass\nlayoffs and the top talent leaving.  \n  \nSure, there are exceptions, like the tech industry, where there are users and\nno customers but this is an anomaly. For most businesses, appointing a female\nHR as CEO will court disaster. If this was not the case many companies would\njust do it.\n\nReply\n\nA new reply to this comment has been posted.

HR analytics is defined as the\nprocess of measuring the impact of HR metrics, such as time to hire and\nretention rate, on business performance._\n\nHuman resources is a people-oriented function and is so perceived by most\npeople. But for those who think that the HR team\u2019s contributions are limited\nto extending offer letters and onboarding new hires, human resource analytics\n(HR analytics) can prove them wrong.

This is done by applying statistical methods to\nintegrated HR, talent management, financial, and operational data,\u201d says\nCollins in an exclusive discussion with HR Technologist.\n\nHR analytics focuses primarily on the HR function and is not \u2013 as is largely\nbelieved \u2013 exactly interchangeable with **[people\nanalytics](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-analytics/what-is-\npeople-analytics/)** or workforce analytics.\n\n### I. HR Analytics, People Analytics, and Workforce Analytics: What is the\nDifference?\n\nThe terms HR analytics, people analytics, and workforce analytics are often\nused interchangeably. But there are slight differences between each of these\nterms. It would help you to know the difference to be able to assess the most\nrelevant data to their function.\n\n![The difference between HR Analytics, People Analytics, and Workforce\nAnalytics](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**The difference between HR Analytics, People Analytics, and Workforce\nAnalytics**\n\n**HR analytics:** HR analytics specifically deals with the metrics of the HR\nfunction, such as time to hire, training expense per employee, and time until\npromotion. All these metrics are managed exclusively by HR for HR.\n\n**People analytics:** People analytics, though comfortably used as a synonym\nfor HR analytics, is technically applicable to \u201cpeople\u201d in general. It can\nencompass any group of individuals even outside the organization. For\ninstance, the term \u201cpeople analytics\u201d may be applied to analytics about the\ncustomers of an organization and not necessarily only employees.\n\n**Workforce analytics:** Workforce analytics is an all-encompassing term\nreferring specifically to employees of an organization. It includes on-site\nemployees, remote employees, gig workers, freelancers, consultants, and any\nother individuals working in various capacities in an organization.\n\nIn the HR context, some workforce analytics metrics and HR analytics metrics\nmay overlap, which is why the two terms are often used as synonyms. The goal\nof the two may also be the same.\n\nFor instance, data on employee productivity and performance informs both HR\nand workforce analytics, and the goal is to improve retention rates and\nenhance the employee experience.\n\n**Learn more:** [**What is Human Capital Management\n(HCM)?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-human-capital-management/)\n\n### II. How Does HR Analytics Drive Business Value?\n\nHR has access to valuable employee data. How can this data be used to enable\nchange in the organization?\n\nThere is a great deal of discussion on replicating the consumer experience in\nthe employee experience. Essentially, the data on consumer behavior and\nmindset can help develop strategies to maximize sales by capitalizing on those\nfactors. Similarly, the data useful for the HR function can be used to improve\nemployee performance, the employee experience, and in turn, maximize business\noutcomes.\n\nCollins offers an example of how HR analytics can be used to enhance business\nvalue. \u201cHR analytics could be used to measure investments in reskilling, which\nwill deliver the right competencies to support a new revenue model, using\ndata-driven insights to modify the training offering as sales results emerge.\u201d\n\nThis is definitive granular data that can not only impact the bottom line, it\ncan also transform **[employee\nengagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-engagement/)** in an organization.\n\n\u201cAs such,\u201d Collins continues, \u201cyou might think about the \u2018ROI\u2019 of HR analytics\nbeing that of increasing the business value derived from using data for talent\ndecisions.\u201d\n\n## **What Metrics Does HR Analytics Measure?**\n\n**![Common metrics measured by HR analytics](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**Common metrics measured by HR analytics**\n\nSeveral HR metrics contribute to business value, but the key question when\nmeasuring these metrics is this: what does the business need?\n\nThis question can be best answered by having a conversation with business\nleaders. A strategic collaboration between the C-suite and HR leaders will\nhelp determine the HR analytics strategy.\n\nBased on the key performance indicators (KPI) of the organization, HR can then\npropose the metrics that can influence these KPIs.\n\nIt is important to note that the C-suite sees a clear connection between the\nneed for analytics and the impact it will have on the bottom line. As an HR\npractitioner, you will need to build a case for why tracking metrics related\nspecifically to the people of the company is critical.\n\nFor instance, the C-suite may not be interested in the number of people who\nhave left the organization voluntarily. What might interest them is how many\nof these employees were in strategic positions or were highly skilled, the\nduration of their employment, what led to their exit, the cost of replacing\nthese employees, and finally, how all these events affect company profits.\n\nHere are some common metrics tracked by HR analytics:\n\n**1\\. Revenue per employee:** Obtained by dividing a company\u2019s revenue by the\ntotal number of employees in the company. This indicates the average revenue\neach employee generates. It is a measure of how efficient an organization is\nat enabling revenue generation through employees.\n\n**2\\. Offer acceptance rate:** The number of accepted formal job offers (not\nverbal) divided by the total number of job offers given in a certain period. A\nhigher rate (above 85%) indicates a good ratio. If it is lower, this data can\nbe used to redefine the company\u2019s talent acquisition strategy.\n\n**3\\. Training expenses per employee:** Obtained by dividing the total\ntraining expense by the total number of employees who received training. The\nvalue of this expense can be determined from measuring the training\nefficiency. Poor efficiency may lead you to re-evaluate the training expense\nper employee.\n\n**4.** **Training efficiency:** Obtained from the analysis of multiple data\npoints, such as performance improvement, test scores, and upward transition in\nemployees\u2019 roles in the organization after training. Measuring training\nefficiency can be crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of a training program.\n\n**5\\. Voluntary turnover rate:** Voluntary turnover occurs when employees\nvoluntarily choose to leave their jobs. It is calculated by dividing the\nnumber of employees who left voluntarily by the total number of employees in\nthe organization. This metric can lead to the identification of gaps in the\n[**employee experience**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-employee-experience/) that are leading to voluntary\n**[attrition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/what-is-attrition-complete-guide/)**.\n\n**6\\. Involuntary turnover rate:** When an employee is terminated from their\nposition, it is termed \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d The rate is calculated by dividing the\nnumber of employees who left involuntarily by the total number of employees in\nthe organization. This metric can be tied back to the recruitment strategy and\nused to develop a plan to improve the quality of hires to avoid involuntary\nturnover.\n\n**7\\. Time to fill:** The number of days between advertising a job opening and\nhiring someone to fill that position. By measuring the time to fill,\nrecruiters can alter their recruitment strategy to identify areas where the\nmost time is being spent.\n\n**8\\. Time to hire:** The number of days between approaching a candidate and\nthe candidate\u2019s acceptance of the job offer. Just like time to fill, data-\ndriven analysis of time to hire can benefit recruiters and help them improve\nthe **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\nto reduce this time.\n\n**9\\. Absenteeism:** Absenteeism is a productivity metric, which is measured\nby dividing the number of days missed by the total number of scheduled\nworkdays. Absenteeism can offer insights into overall employee health and can\nalso serve as an indicator of employee happiness.\n\n**10\\. Human capital risk:** This may include employee-related risks, such as\nthe absence of a specific skill to fill a new type of job, the lack of\nqualified employees to fill leadership positions, the potential of an employee\nto leave the job based on several factors, such as relationship with managers,\ncompensation, and absence of a clear succession plan. HR analytics can be used\nto measure all these metrics.\n\n## **What Data Does an HR Analytics Tool Need?**\n\nBroadly, the data required by an HR analytics tool is classified into internal\nand external data. One of the biggest challenges in data collection is the\ncollection of the right data and quality data.\n\n**![Common data sources HR analytics solutions](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**Common data sources HR analytics solutions**\n\n**I. Internal data**\n\n  \nInternal data specifically refers to data obtained from the HR department of\nan organization. The core HR system contains several data points that can be\nused for an HR analytics tool. Some of the metrics that an HRIS system\ncontains includes:\n\n1\\. Employee tenure  \n2\\. Employee compensation  \n3\\. Employee training records  \n4\\. Performance appraisal data  \n5\\. Reporting structure  \n6\\. Details on high-value, high-potential employees  \n7\\. Details on any disciplinary action taken against an employee\n\nThe only challenge here is that sometimes, this data is disconnected and so\nmay not serve as a reliable measure. This is where the data scientist can play\na meaningful role. They can organize this scattered data and create buckets of\nrelevant data points, which can then be used for the analytics tool.\n\n**II. External data**\n\n  \nExternal data is obtained by establishing working relationships with other\ndepartments of the organization. Data from outside the organization is also\nessential, as it offers a global perspective that working with data from\nwithin the organization cannot.\n\n**1\\. Financial data:** Organization-wide financial data is key in any HR\nanalysis to calculate, for instance, the revenue per employee or the cost of\nhire.\n\n**2\\. Organization-specific data:** Depending on the type of organization and\nits core offering (product or service), the type of data that HR needs to\nsupplement analytics will vary.\n\nFor example, says Collins, \u201cHR leaders at a global retailer should power their\nanalytics engine with store revenue and costs and customer experience data,\nwhereas HR at a construction company might pursue operational \u2013 health and\nsafety \u2013 data and data related to contingent labor costs.\u201d\n\n**3\\. Passive data from employees:** Employees continually provide data that\nis stored in the HRIS from the moment they are approached for a job.\nAdditionally, data from their social media posts and shares and from feedback\nsurveys can be used to guide HR data analysis.\n\n**4\\. Historical data:** Several global economic, political, or environmental\nevents determine patterns in employee behavior. Such data can offer insights\nthat limited internal data cannot.\n\nFor example, the recession in 2008 was a global event that changed the way\nemployees perceived jobs or \u201cwork.\u201d The freelance, start-up and gig economies\ntook off as people continued to lose their jobs. Data from such a critical\nhistorical event can help predict how the workforce may react to similar\nshifts in the future. It can then be used to identify trends in the current\nworkforce and predict voluntary and involuntary turnover.\n\n## **How to Get Started With HR Analytics**\n\nFor HR leaders keen to **get started with using HR analytics** for data-based\ndecision making, here are some tips:\n\n**![The complete HR analytics cycle](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**The complete HR analytics cycle**\n\n### **I. Create a collective mindset**\n\n  \nBefore the operational and mathematical aspect can kick in, HR leaders must\nprepare their teams and organizations for a workflow-driven by analytics.\n\nWhile the discussion with the C-suite for the need for analytics is one part\nof the change, the other is preparing your team to deal with the amount of\ndata that they will now be using to measure the change.\n\nThis is a crucial aspect of **[HR\u2019s digital\ntransformation](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-hr-digital-transformation/)** as well as company-wide\ndigital transformation. Getting the team started on small projects and asking\nthem to create the reports that they will discuss with business leaders is a\ngood way to begin.\n\n### **II. Bring in data scientists**\n\n  \nThe data scientist is expected to become an integral part of HR teams. They\nare best suited to assess the viability of an analytics solution. They can\nalso ensure the robustness of the statistical modeling and predictions.\n\nAs Collins says, \u201cdata scientists will play an invaluable role in creating a\nculture of analytics across HR. As the role of HR business partners and\ngeneralists evolves to include skills such as data strategy, analysis, and\ncommunication (articulating \u2018the story behind the science\u2019), the data\nscientist will serve as the coach, mentoring their colleagues across HR in how\nto understand, and apply, the insights.\u201d\n\n### **III. Start small**\n\n  \nA great technique to convince stakeholders that HR analytics can drive\nbusiness value is to first implement a small project successfully. Called\n\u201cquick wins,\u201d these projects can deliver tangible results in a short amount of\ntime with high impact.\n\n### **IV. Get clearance from the legal team**\n\n  \nThe sort of data collection that HR analytics uses is governed heavily by\ncompliance laws. Some legal considerations to keep in mind when implementing\nan HR analytics solution are:\n\n  1. Employee privacy and anonymity\n  2. Consent from employees about the amount and type of data being collected\n  3. Establishing the goal of data collection and informing employees accordingly\n  4. IT security when using third-party software to run HR analytics\n  5. Location of the HR analytics vendor \u2013 with whom the data will be stored \u2013 and their compliance with local laws\n\n  \nCollaborate with the legal team of your organization to ensure ethics and\ncompliance norms are followed.\n\n### **V. Choose an HR analytics solution**\n\nAny HR analytics solution that will be used at scale must have certain\ncomponents.\n\n**![The key features of an HR analytics solution](/images/ajax-loader.png)**\n\n**The key features of an HR analytics solution**\n\n**1\\. They answer the business questions the C-suite asks.** This may require\nthat you invest in a solution to address each question, leading to investments\nin multiple analytics solutions for granular data on each question.\nAlternatively, you may choose a unified solution that can assess multiple\nmetrics to answer each business question.\n\n**2\\. They are easy to use by individuals who are not data scientists.** An\naccessible solution created for laypersons is ideal when they want to assess\nany one or more metrics without interrupting the workflow of the data\nscientist.\n\n**3\\. They are cloud-based rather than on-premise.** A cloud-based solution\nalso aids accessibility without heavy IT integration. This grants HR the\nautonomy to use the solution as and when needed.\n\n**4\\. They are powered with statistical analysis and machine learning\ntechnology.** Big data platforms require advanced data management systems\npowered by machine learning and natural language processing. This allows the\ntechnology to learn and reason autonomously, revealing insights that data\nscientists can then analyze.\n\n**5\\. They are based on predictive analytics.** \u201c[Predictive analytics is] the\npractice of extracting information from existing data sets to determine\npatterns and forecast future outcomes. Analysts use statistical methods to\nforecast future alternatives \u2013 will the current termination rate continue at\nthe same pace or might we expect a surge of exits as the job market\nstrengthens?\u201d explains Collins.\n\n**6\\. They are powered with visualization technology.** A visual\nrepresentation of vast amounts of data can allow for better understanding of\ntrends and events. The complex data processed through an analytics engine\nrequires advanced visualization software, as it cannot be presented in simple\ncharts and presentations.\n\n**7\\. They are available through a subscription model.** Subscription models\nof software as a service (SaaS) platforms are useful because they easily allow\nyou to access the latest upgrades in technology. They also eliminate the\nsignificant upfront expense of purchasing an analytics solution and may be a\nmore cost-efficient way of investing in analytics.\n\n## **So, Should You Invest in an HR Analytics Solution?**\n\nHR analytics offers some undoubted benefits. It allows HR teams to\nsignificantly streamline processes that reduce costs, reduce attrition, and\nconsequently improve the bottom line.\n\nWith task automation, you are freed up to innovate and explore the human\naspect of human resources without spending time on tracking mountains of data\nfrom multiple sources.\n\nOverall, the use of HR analytics has been established as an HR technology\ntrend for 2019, as it is posed to improve the employee experience that\ndirectly translates into improved business outcomes.\n\nHowever, it also presents some real challenges.\n\nAs Collins tells us, \u201cWhile HR is ambitious about the use of predictive HR\nanalytics, two HR leaders I recently spoke with said \u2018we want to be able to\npredict everything!\u2019 The vision for how analytics will become an HR core\ncompetency is being constrained by limited consumption (insights being shared\nonly within the four walls of HR) and action (the research does not lead to a\nprogram change or new investment). There is still much progress to be made.\u201d\n\nIn addition, because data is siloed across the organization and conversations\nabout the goal of implementing analytics are unclear, the valuable data HR\nrequires for analytics is often underutilized.\n\nThe challenge is in waiting to actually see results. Predictive analytics is\nlikely to take a minimum of 24 months to show meaningful results, but it will\nhelp get started with HR transformation. So, the time to get started with HR\nanalytics is now.\n\nBy making a strong business case to key stakeholders, as an HR practitioner,\nyou can leverage the power of analytics to become a strategic business partner\nwho makes substantial contributions to the business.\n\n_Do you use HR analytics to capture critical data?

As such, it continues to\ntranscend all industries all over the world.  Why?  First and foremost, people\nare a company's greatest asset.  In the same vein, a company's value is\nperpetually linked to the success of its people.\n\nAdditionally, study after study shows companies offering growth and\ndevelopment opportunities translates to high success in recruitment and\nretention.  Talent management itself is a commitment from an organization to\nrecruit, hire, retain, and develop employees.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the HR Exchange Network will put a focus on [talent\nmanagement](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nmanagement/articles/talent-management-guide) by explaining each tenement and\nthe inherent challenges that accompany them in a series of articles.  These\ntenements are often referred to as the pillars of talent management.\n\n# Pillars of Talent Management Explained\n\nTo better understand each pillar, a description of each is below.\n\n  * Recruitment - In order for a talent management strategy to exist, there must first be talent. Recruitment is Step 1 in creating the strategy.  Here, companies and organizations work to attract talented people who can be converted in to employees.\n  * [Learning and Development](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/learning/articles/learning-and-development-talent-management-pillars-part-ii) - This pillar includes everything from ongoing training to learning during the employee lifecycle. It allows for workers to fine-tune and further develop the critical skills needed to meet their performance goals and to help the company complete its strategic goals.\n  * [Performance Management](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-management/articles/performance-management-talent-management-pillars-part-iii) - Once hired, talent is expected to perform at a high standard. This process includes the way in which HR measures and improves performance.  Common procedures include performance reviews, one-on-one meetings, and reward and recognition programs.\n  * [Retention](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-management/articles/retention-talent-management-pillars-part-iv) - As defined, retention is about keeping high performing talent with the company or organization as long as possible. This leads to increased productivity and successful completion of strategic goals.\n\n## Recruitment\n\nOf all the pillars within talent management,\n[recruitment](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nacquisition/articles/10-tips-for-recruiting-the-best-talent) is where most\nhuman resources professionals will put the majority of their focus.  Why?  We\nhave to look at the ongoing labor shortage.  To put it simply, recruiters are\nhaving a much more difficult time finding the talent they need to fill their\nopen job positions.  Dependent upon which numbers are sourced, there is\nsomewhere in the vicinity of a million more jobs than workers.\n\n#### Recruiting in the Labor Shortage Era\n\n![](https://plsadaptive.s3.amazonaws.com/eco/images/channel_content/images/recruiting_n_the_labor_shortage_era_cover_-\n_copy_1.jpg)\n\n50% of HR managers say they have open positions and not one qualified\ncandidate to fill that opening. The latest report of HR Exchange Network\nprovides actionable advice on how to recruit when talent is scare and at a\npremium.  Download it NOW!\n\n[Learn More](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\nacquisition/reports/recruiting-in-the-labor-shortage-\nera/?utm_source=Inline_Ad&utm_medium=Portal&utm_campaign=HRIQ-20-Recruiting%20in%20the%20Labor%20Shortage%20Era&utm_term=&utm_content=&disc=&extTreatId=7503448)\n\nBut that's not all.  Human resources professionals also have to deal with\nchanges happening to the workforce and pay spectacular attention to detail\nwhen it comes to bringing new talent into the fold.\n\nFor instance, a huge focus is being put on the candidate experience.  This\ncovers everything from the moment a candidate comes in to contact with a\npotential employer all the way to the onboarding process.  While that seems\nstraightforward enough, there are other nuances that can play a role.\n\nFor instance, communication.\n\nRecruiters have to constantly be in contact with the candidate especially\nconsidering the average time to fill a job post is 42 days.  Faltering in the\nability to communicate could cost a company its best employee, not to mention\nthe amount of money lost every day the position remains vacant.\n\n> Want to know more about personalizing recruitment in the Age of\n> Transformation?  [Click here](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\n> acquisition/whitepapers/personalizing-recruitment-in-an-age-of-digital-\n> transformation).\n\nThere is also the need for transparency.\n\nIn a survey from PayScale regarding job satisfaction and pay for instance, the\norganization found the more information employees have about why they make\nwhat they make translates to higher retention rates.\n\n### Power to the Job Seekers\n\nIt goes without saying, but job seekers are in the driver's seat when it comes\nto recruitment\n\nThat is a huge obstacle to overcome, but it can be overcome.\n\n_Recruit Internally._   The best talent doesn't always come from an external\nsource.  Sometimes, it comes from within.  It's important to understand what\nskills internal candidates possess and to align those with the current job\nvacancies.  Additionally, this calls succession planning, a different form of\nrecruitment, to mind. Companies must also be on the lookout for critical\npositions that will come open in the future.  The three most important steps\nto follow here are:\n\n  1. Evaluate all positions and the skills needed for the candidate to be successful\n  2. Evaluate internal candidates for the necessary skills\n  3. Align the positions with the appropriate candidate\n\n_Building a Talent Pool._   In a similar vein to succession planning, HR\nprofessionals and recruiters need to build and constantly tend the talent\npool.  Making contact with potential employees isn't always easy, but once\ncontact is made and an assessment of their skill and abilities is complete,\nthese candidates should be constantly nurtured.  Even if the candidate doesn't\nfit a current job vacancy, it doesn't mean a future opening will be out of the\nquestion. It also helps with the quickening pace with which recruitment\nprofessionals are having to contend.\n\n> RELATED:  [Recruit Like A Social Media\n> Influencer](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/hr-talent-\n> acquisition/articles/recruit-like-a-social-media-influencer)\n\n_Be agile._   Recruitment professionals must be able to react and react\nquickly.  Potential candidates are also being vetted by competitors in most\ncases.  Being able to quickly assess a candidate to see if he or she is the\nright one for the company is critical.  So too is making the job offer and\nstarting the onboarding process to secure the candidate as an employee.\n\n_Communicate._   As previously mentioned, highly desirable candidates are\nbeing approached by multiple companies for employment.  It is critical a\ncompany be able to \"standout\" from the crowd in this respect.  The best way to\naccomplish that is through a strong candidate experience strategy.  Candidates\nare paying attention to how companies communicate as a demonstration of its\ncompany culture.  Those companies who do not communicate constantly and\nconsistently run a real risk of losing the top candidate to another company.\n\n## The Future of Recruitment\n\nRight now, it's hard to see what the future has in store for recruiting.  So\nmany things are changing in the HR space as a whole, it's not that surprising\nof a statement.  One thing is for sure, however, while recruiting still\nrequires the human element, technology continues its invasion into the space.\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, by 2022 -- 50 percent of companies\nexpect their full-time workforce will be reduced, in some way, by automation.\nThat could have a very real impact on recruiting.  It's not suggested\norganizations will turn over the entirety of the recruiting function to a\nmachine, but it will have a more prominent role in the process.\n\nFor recruiters, it's time to get comfortable with the technology because in\nthe very near future, it will be a part of the function\u2026 not just a fun tool\nto make the job easier.\n\n> NEXT:  [Learning and Development:  Talent Management Pillars Part\n> II](https://www.hrexchangenetwork.com/learning/articles/learning-and-\n> development-talent-management-pillars-part-ii)\n\n\n\n**_Want more content faster?

This entails not only filling in vacancies but also predicting talent\nrequirements and proactively managing talent.\n\nFor example, with succession planning becoming an effective practice across\nsectors, especially for senior executives, recruiters today need to be able to\nbuild and keep handy a steady **[talent\npipeline](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-\nis-talent-pipeline/)** to fill in those vacancies that cannot be filled\nthrough internal hiring or promotions.\n\nWith the state of flux that characterizes the current talent and business\necosystems, there is a growing need for smarter recruitment strategies. This\ninvolves identifying talent needs, developing ways to source the target talent\ngroup, building an employer brand that can motivate application, applying\nmodern screening and selection technologies, and formulating effective\nonboarding strategies to help new employees succeed.\n\nThere are job aggregators like LinkedIn, Indeed, CareerBuilder, or Google For\nJobs that have currently changed how candidates seek the right roles, how\nsources hunt for the right candidates, and how candidates and recruiters\ninteract.\n\nRecruitment is a conveyor belt of constituent sub-processes, every one of\nwhich has a crucial part to play in getting the best talent on board.\n\nTerms such as staffing, hiring, recruitment, and talent acquisition are often\nused interchangeably. However, there are subtle differences between these\nprocesses.\n\n### **Staffing vs. Hiring vs. Recruiting vs. Talent Acquisition (TA)**\n\n  \nHere\u2019s how recruitment is different from staffing, hiring, and talent\nacquisition.\n\n**Staffing:** A form of focused, (usually) short-term hiring to fulfill a\nspecific requirement. It is operational in nature with a short-term focus.\n\n**Hiring:** Filling a vacancy from a ready pool of job seekers. This method is\ntactical with a focus on short- to medium-term goals.\n\n**Recruiting:** A medium-term focused, linear, and reactive approach to find\nthe best fit for an existing job from a large pool of suitable candidates.\n\n**Talent Acquisition (TA):** The strategic, long-term, and proactive process\nof finding, acquiring, assessing, and hiring candidates to fill roles that are\nrequired to meet present and future organizational goals.\n\n**Learn More:[Talent Acquisition vs. Recruitment: Key Differences and\nSimilarities](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/talent-acquisition-vs-recruitment/)**\n\n## **The Process of Recruitment**\n\nNow that we understand where recruitment features in the staffing to talent\nacquisition spectrum, let\u2019s delve deeper into the recruitment process.\n\n### **Step 1: Talent-needs assessment**\n\n  \nThis step lays the groundwork on which the process of recruitment rests.\nAnalyzing talent needs leads to two specific outcomes \u2013 the creation of the\njob description and creation of the candidate persona.\n\nJob analysis and talent gap analysis allow insight into what skills and\ncapabilities will be required to fill the positions and to propel the\norganization onward. These processes also help in identifying the best-fit\ncandidate by drawing attention to the primary purpose of the position, the\nessential functions that the new employee will carry out, the minimum\nrequirements needed to perform these functions, and the personality traits\nthat will enable success in the job.\n\nThere are three positive outcomes of an effective job description and\ncandidate profile exercise:\n\n**1\\. A clear map for continuous improvement of the organizational\nstructure:** With detailed, effective job descriptions, it becomes easier to\nconduct an organizational audit, to prune out redundant jobs, and to focus\nmore on the roles that hold importance for the future.\n\n**2\\. Evaluation of competencies required for each role:** In writing the job\ndescription for a position, the competencies required for the role are also\nanalyzed. The idea is to include skill sets that ensure a positive impact\nwithin the organizational structure.\n\n**3\\. Deeper insight into compensation for every level:** Compensation and\n[job satisfaction](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-\nengagement/job-satisfaction-definition-factors-importance-statistics-\nexamples/) are closely linked. While various non-monetary aspects affect an\nemployee\u2019s happiness at work, dissatisfaction with what one is paid is a step\nbackward. A review of the job description and the market at large is necessary\nto understand whether you provide competitive compensation.\n\nAssessing talent needs is the first step in **[full-cycle\nrecruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-full-cycle-recruitment/)** and ensures that all\nrecruitment efforts move in the right direction \u2013 towards recruiting the right\ntalent.\n\n### **Step 2: Talent sourcing**\n\n  \nOnce you have conducted an effective talent gap analysis, the next step of\nrecruitment \u2013 **[talent\nsourcing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-transformation/what-\nis-talent-sourcing/)** \u2013 begins. This is where having a strong employer brand\ncomes into play.\n\nTalent sourcing involves advertising your job vacancy across job portals and\nall possible avenues that can connect you to the target talent pool and\neventually to the right talent. When it comes to sourcing talent, you can rely\non a host of talent pools, including:\n\n  * Employee referrals\n  * Online job portals\n  * Social media portals\n  * Internal job postings\n  * Offline ads in newspapers and magazines\n  * Campus recruitment drives\n  * Website career pages\n\n  \nSourcing is about casting a wide net while keeping in mind what you are\nfishing for. The objective of talent sourcing is to encourage applications and\nto get the target audience to listen, apply, and commit to the process.\n\n**Learn More:** **[How to Become a Smart Recruitment Specialist in\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/how-to-\nbecome-a-smart-recruitment-specialist/)**\n\n### **Step 3: Candidate screening**\n\n  \nAssuming that your sourcing efforts were successful and met with a tsunami of\napplications, it is also fair to assume that a large percentage of these\napplications may be irrelevant.\n\nScreening through the barrage of applications to find the perfect hire is\ncrucial. Candidate screening usually involves the following steps:\n\n**1\\. Preliminary screening: A preliminary screening is essential to save time\nlater in the systems and can now be performed** by artificial intelligence\n(AI)-based recruiting tools. [**Recruitment\nchatbots**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/what-is-the-potential-of-chatbots-in-recruiting/) like those by\nAllyO, Xor, and Brazen can have multiple conversations simultaneously and\ncater to any questions that candidates may have. These tools use algorithms to\npick out the most relevant information from the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and establish whether\nor not the candidate matches the job specifications.\n\nThis stage could be very time-consuming if all r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are screened manually.\nAt the same time, the algorithms being used to train AI recruiters need to be\ndynamic enough to completely substitute human screening.\n\n**2\\. Initial interview:** Shortlisted candidates are usually put through a\nshort first-level interview with the HR or the hiring manager either online or\nover the phone. This offers more insights into the person behind the CV while\nalso humanizing the organization for the candidate. With AI assistants that\ncan mimic voices and human behavior, however, an interview with an AI\nrecruiter seems closer to fact than fiction today.\n\n**3\\. Skills and psychometric testing:** Any candidate comes with a skill-set\nsuitcase, a package of potential, and a bag of behaviors. To assess these\npreexisting facets, you need a set of tests and tools to ensure their\nobjectivity, reliability, and validity.\n\n**[Background\nverifications](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/background-\nverification/selecting-the-right-background-verification-partner/)** are also\nconducted to validate all claims the candidate has made and to form a more\nholistic picture of the person behind the persona.\n\n**4\\. Final interview:** This is for the finalists \u2013 the top one or two\ncandidates who have passed all the preceding stages of screening. The final\ninterview is usually with the immediate reporting manager or line manager, the\nHR manager in charge, and depending on the band or level that the employee\nwill be entering, the VP, MD, or CEO of the organization.\n\n**Learn More:** **[Top 10 Recruitment Analytics Tools for\n2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-\nrecruitment-data-analytics-software/)**\n\nWhile this is a formality, it often helps in gaining different perspectives on\nthe same candidate from different sources. It could also be a good check for\nany red flags that might have been missed.\n\nAfter the final interview, the hiring manager, reporting manager, and\nfunctional heads make a joint decision, having weighed out the pros and cons\nof the final candidates.\n\n**[Recruitment bias](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/recognizing-and-addressing-unconscious-bias-in-the-recruitment-\nhiring-process/)** (whether it is that of projection, confirmation, or of\nobserver expectancy) is a tendency very often observed in this process, which\nis so reliant on our subjective perception of another person. Tools like\nHackerRank and Pymetrics have changed how even the most technical of skills\ncan be assessed without bias through objective tests that have minimum\ndependence on human (tester) intervention and judgment.\n\nWhile technology could surely intervene (though algorithms have often been\nproven to be biased as well), it would be helpful to make those in charge of\nthe screening, selection, and interview process more aware of how bias works\nand how they could be more objective in their decisions.\n\n**Learn More:[At What Stage Should Hiring Algorithms Enter the Recruiting\nProcess?](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/when-\nshould-hiring-algorithms-enter-the-recruiting-process/)**\n\n### **Step 4: The offer letter**\n\n  \nOnce a largely unanimous decision is reached about which of the shortlisted\ncandidates fits the job requirement and all background checks are done, the\noffer letter is finalized. It is drafted based on the expectations of the\ncandidate, the job market and the organization\u2019s culture, budget, and\npractices and then extended to the candidate.\n\nIf all is in keeping with what the candidate had in mind, they accept the\noffer (either in person or online). If not, it may lead to a round of\nnegotiation to come to an agreement that makes sense for both the candidate\nand the organization. If such negotiations fail and the candidate rejects the\noffer, the company either extends the offer to the next-in-line candidate or\nrestarts the recruitment process.\n\n### **Step 5: Onboarding and induction**\n\n  \nOnce the offer letter is accepted, the individual transforms from a candidate\nto an employee. Whether the new employee succeeds and is happy in the new role\nor not is determined greatly by the initial experiences they have in the\norganization. This includes the\n[**onboarding**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) and induction process and how the\nemployee is encouraged and oriented within the fabric of the organization.\n\n**Learn More:[Candidate Screening and Selection Process: The Complete Guide\nfor 2020](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-\nis-candidate-screening-and-selection/)**\n\n## **Five Fresh Recruitment Techniques for 2020**\n\nThe general context around recruitment has been evolving in light of newer\ninclusions of technology, changing organizational needs, and growing candidate\nexpectations. With that setting the backdrop, you need fresh recruitment\ntechniques to help you navigate the sea of talent.\n\nHere are five fresh recruitment techniques to engage with top talent in 2020\nand beyond:\n\n### **1\\. Quicker processes: Keep it short and sweet**\n\n  \nThat we do not have very long attention spans or endless patience is a known\nfact. With that in mind, it would be impractical to expect candidates to stick\non and stay engaged and committed to a long-drawn recruitment process.\n\nAn important recruitment technique to keep in mind for the near future is to\nkeep processes as short and meaningful as possible \u2013 no endless wait for\nfeedback, no time spent in deciding what the next step is or who will take the\nnext assessment/interview, and no time invested in admin processes that can\neasily be managed by the right ATS.\n\nA 2016 survey of over 1,000 professionals across fields conducted by\nrecruiting firm Robert Half reported that candidates lose interest in the job\nopening if the process and feedback cycle takes longer than two weeks. The\ntechnique to condense the process effectively into an engaging experience is\nsomething that you must strategize.\n\n### **2\\. Recruitment marketing: Engage passive candidates**\n\n  \nCandidates are customers too, and while some may be on an active job hunt,\nothers may be passively browsing through. The latter group could also have\nyour ideal employee, and it would be unfortunate to miss an opportunity to get\nthe right candidate on board simply because they were not as desperate for a\njob as the others.\n\n**[Recruitment marketing](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/affordable-recruitmentmarketingplatforms/)** is as crucial as\nmarketing the products and services that an organization has on offer. This\nneeds to be focused branded marketing of the organizational culture, the job,\nthe career path ahead and the promise of an employee experience worth\ninvesting in.\n\n![Five fresh recruitment techniques for 2020](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 1. Five fresh recruitment techniques for 2020_**\n\n### **3\\. Increased visibility: Get seen across portals**\n\n  \nAccording to studies by the HCM suite solution company ICIMS, 69% of job\nseekers use Google to look for jobs. Moreover, 83% of millennials are even\nmore dependent on Google and online portals for finding the right job.\n\nAs a smart recruiter, engaging top talent would entail making the posting\nvisible across different mediums and portals. The use of effective SEO\nstrategies would be an added bonus in ensuring that the job listings rank\nhigher for jobs searched on Google and other relevant search engines.\n\n### **4\\. Engaging job descriptions: Make them _want_ to apply**\n\n  \nCreating organic buzz and interest around a job opening is a technique that\nyou need to invest in. The job description is a tool that serves a dual\npurpose \u2013 of informing the candidate in detail about the job opening, and of\npiquing the candidates\u2019 interest in the role and the organization.\n\nJob descriptions are often the first piece of communication from the\norganization to a prospective applicant and should be treated and tools of\nbranded marketing to get the right information across. These **[intelligent\njob descriptions](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/ramp-up-your-recruitment-with-intelligent-job-descriptions/)** also\nheave to be in a format and language that resonates with the target talent\naudience.\n\n### **5\\. A well-maintained rejection pile: Re-engage second choices**\n\n  \nRe-engaging with rejected candidates is a great technique to save time and\neffort. All this data should ideally be easily accessible to you, and you\nwould already know the reason each candidate was rejected.\n\nRemember that there may be a few candidates who passed most of the rounds of\ncandidate screening but might not have been selected for some valid reason at\nthe time. This is a useful repository of screened candidates that could help\nyou skip a few steps in the process. This also points to the need of effective\n**[candidate relationship\nmanagement](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-management-definition-best-practices/)** (CRM)\nsince rejected candidates are not only useful talent sources but also channels\nfor propagating the employer brand.\n\n## **What Are Recruitment Metrics?**\n\nHaving a recruitment process in place is just where the journey begins.\nRecruitment deals with people (and AI, yes, but still most people) on either\nside and is a dynamic process. The process your organization follows needs to\nbe assessed regularly and tweaked, modified, or completely turned on its head\nin keeping with changing needs in a shifting environment.\n\nRecruitment metrics are tools that measure and assess the performance of every\nstep in the recruitment process against the specified goals that the\norganization wishes to achieve through recruitment.\n\nLet\u2019s take a peek at the eight most important recruitment metrics that you\ncannot do without:\n\n### **1\\. Time to fill**\n\n  \nTime to fill is an important metric, and it can be gauged with ease and\nobjectivity. It is a speed metric that measures the time required for a\nrecruiter to fill a vacancy from the time that the requisition was raised till\nthe offer is accepted.\n\nDelving deeper into the time-to-fill metric reveals the time taken to fill a\nvacancy with the right candidate (though measuring the right-ness might\nrequire further time on the job), the efficiency of the recruitment process,\nand any bottlenecks that may cause a greater lapse of time.\n\n### **2\\. Cost per hire**\n\n  \nCost per hire denotes the average expense of the whole process from sourcing\nto onboarding. While the cost per hire has a major impact on the bottom line\nof large enterprises, for smaller organizations it could have serious\nrepercussions on the annual budget. More often than not, the time to fill a\nrole and the cost go hand in hand. The faster a role is filled, the lesser\nresources need to be earmarked for the process.\n\n![Figure 2. Recruitment metrics](/images/ajax-loader.png)\n\n**_Figure 2. Recruitment metrics_**\n\n### **3\\. Quality of hires**\n\n  \nThe equation to measure the quality of hires (QoH) is usually the percentage\nof candidates who accepted your offer added to those who stayed (retention\nnumbers) divided by 2. However, you could determine the quality of hire based\non any indicator of quality that makes sense for your organization.\n\nFor example, suppose you decide your indicators are the performance of the new\nemployees, their engagement levels, and their culture fit, then:\n\nQoH = (New hire performance + new hire engagement + culture fit)/3\n\nIf we take hypothetical values for each indicator:  \nQoH = (80% + 85% + 90%)/3  \nQoH = 85%\n\nThis metric also gives you an understanding of the return on investment (ROI)\nfrom the resources invested in the recruitment process by pointing towards a\nclear success percentage.\n\n### **4\\. Source of hire**\n\n  \nSource of hire assesses your usual talent pools \u2013 online job boards or\nportals, professional networks, recruitment agencies, or employee referrals.\nMost **[applicant tracking\nsoftware](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-10-ats-2020/)** (ATS) offers a holistic, detailed picture of\nwhere most candidates were shortlisted and selected from.\n\nATS solutions by Bullhorn, Greenhouse, and SAP SuccessFactors can be applied\nto organizations of varying needs and sizes and customized for seamless\nintegration with existing systems and processes.\n\nKnowing the pros and cons of each source of hire helps you identify high-\nperforming sources and those that are not worth investing in. This metric thus\naims to maximize conversions by focusing efforts and resources on high-yield\nsources.\n\n### **5\\. Rate of conversion**\n\n  \nThe rate of conversion is a direct comparison between the number of candidates\nthat have been offered a job and those who accept the offer. If your offer\nacceptance rate is low, it is likely that your job offer is not competitive or\nyour employer brand not strong enough to influence a job offer acceptance.\n\nRethink your offer in terms of salary, perks, or growth opportunities to keep\nyour candidates from considering your competitors. If your job offers are\nbeing rejected due to salary and you are not in a position to compete with a\nbetter package, then consider options such as flexible work timings, free\nfood, or work from home options.\n\n### **6\\. Rate of attrition**\n\n  \nA high attrition rate \u2013 though it is a result of a complex mix of factors \u2013 is\nan indication that there may be something amiss in the recruitment process,\nand this could end up costing the company heavily.\n\nIncorrect job descriptions or failure to identify committed and loyal\ncandidates are directly linked to higher[ attrition\nrates](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-is-\nattrition-complete-guide/), though at times, more covert indicators such as\nthe perception of the employer brand, happiness at work, and belongingness\naffect the metric as well.\n\n### **7\\. Candidate experience**\n\n  \nThe recruitment process greatly impacts the **[candidate\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-candidate-experience-definition-components-technology/)**\nand paves the way for **[employee\nexperience](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/employee-engagement/what-\nis-employee-experience-and-how-to-improve-it/)** as well. How well the process\nmeets candidate expectations of timely communication, honest feedback, and a\nglitch-free system affects the experience each candidate has during\nrecruitment. This experience can affect not only their decision to accept the\noffer letter but also how they behave on the job post acceptance of the offer.\n\nCRM software by vendors such as SmashFly, Avature, Beamery, and Jibe are\ncounted upon by various organizations, which are driven to improve the\nexperience they offer candidates and prospective employees.\n\nEvery touchpoint of your recruiting process is an opportunity to provide a\npositive candidate experience. Candidates who drop out during the process\nshould be asked to provide feedback on why they chose to do so. You can then\nmake amends accordingly to devise a process that is more engaging, efficient,\nand meaningful.\n\n### **8\\. Diversity of hires**\n\n  \nDiversity should be more than a mere legal compliance clause. Yes, equal\nopportunity regulations mandate that organizations hire and encourage\nrepresentation from multiple sociocultural societal segments, but diversity\nneeds to be the mainstay of the culture at work and not just a mandate.\n\nRelooking at recruitment metrics to check whether there was any bias exercised\nwith regard to cast, creed, color, age, religion, race, ethnicity, gender,\nnational origin, disability, sexual orientation, or genetic information is\ninsightful and helps you build a strategy to be more inclusive, organically.\n\nMoreover, diverse workforces are usually alive with different perspectives,\ncontexts and have proven to hold the potential to skyrocket organizational\nsuccess.\n\nA recent study by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) reported that \"increasing\nthe diversity of leadership teams leads to more and better innovation and\nimproved financial performance.\" This study collected data from 1,700\ndifferent companies located across 8 countries, from varying sectors, and with\na wide range in terms of employee strength. The findings are interesting as\ncompanies with more diverse management teams were seen to have 19% higher\nrevenue than those who had homogenous teams.\n\n**Learn More:[5 Expert-Recommended Essentials of a Powerful Talent Acquisition\nStrategy](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/expert-tips-building-talent-acquisition-strategy/)**\n\n## **Recruitment Strategies for 2020**\n\nOnce you locate which mile you are at on the smart recruitment journey, it is\ntime to start taking action to shift towards the right strategies to meet your\nrecruitment goals for 2020.\n\n**[Recruitment strategies](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/top-ten-employee-recruitment-strategies/)** need to be tailored\nto your unique context while addressing multiple parameters. Critical success\nfactors for moving forward in your smart recruitment journey include:\n\n### **1\\. Organizational need**\n\n  \nThe foremost aspect of moving forward in the recruitment journey is to\nestablish the need for a strategy \u2013 a sound business case of why the\norganization needs to transform its recruitment practices. The business case\ncould be built on any or more of several factors depending on\norganizational/business focus:\n\n**Business effectiveness / Productivity goals:** Measuring current recruitment\noutcomes by metrics such as quality of hire, new hire retention, and feedback\nas well as the availability of ready internal talent.\n\n**Operational efficiency** : For organizations with a strong focus on cost,\nbuilding a case based on time to hire, cost per hire, and resources utilized\nor overheads involved will offer valid reasoning to move up the smart\nrecruitment journey.\n\n**Attracting talent:** In this highly competitive environment of talent\ncrunch, diverse workforces, and diverse workplace motivators and expectations,\nthere is a strong need for organizations to seem attractive to candidates.\nSmarter recruitment strategies built around enhancing the employer brand and\n**[employee value\nproposition](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-employee-value-proposition-and-how-to-create-a-successful-\nevp-model/)** (EVP) can lead to high recruitment success.\n\n### **2\\. An organization\u2019s technology infrastructure**\n\n  \nThe technology that an organization uses plays a crucial part in how fast it\ncan evolve and move further along the recruitment journey. Let\u2019s look at the\ntechnology-centric aspects that affect recruitment strategies and processes:\n\n**Big data:** In the future of recruitment, the devil is in the data for sure!\nThe availability of and access to **[quality data will make or break the best\nof recruitment\nstrategies](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/using-data-to-optimize-recruitment-budget/)**. Any automation, AI,\nor machine learning (ML) can only be as effective as the data it utilizes.\n\n**Technical Blueprint:** It\u2019s also important to understand the technical\narchitecture of an organization and how recruitment technologies will interact\nor integrate with the existing systems. Mastering the current technology will\nallow you to be an effective early adopter when new technology comes into\nplay.\n\n**Technology-adaptive learning:** With innovations in digital recruitment\ncoming in waves of evolution, it is paramount that people affected stay\nabreast of these changes. You need to have opportunities in place to help\nemployees learn new recruitment technologies faster and to encourage the\napplication of the same at work.\n\n### **3\\. Mindset and skill set of stakeholders**\n\n  \nAs you gear up to face the digital recruitment landscape, you will notice that\nthe associated roles are changing and so are the responsibilities. There is a\nneed for the overall mindset and skillset upgrade across recruitment\nstakeholders \u2013 hiring managers, business leaders, and employees. Some notable\nskills and mindset traits required across the board are:\n\n**Technology orientation:** It is no longer merely the IT team\u2019s role to be\ncomfortable with complex technology. Recruiters and all stakeholders involved\nin hiring need to be conversant with newer technologies, tech-oriented\nplatforms, and digital forms of communication and engagement.\n\n**Relationship building:** As technology takes over most of the regular,\nrepetitive tasks and activities, the role of humans involved in recruitment \u2013\nthe recruiters, interviewers, hiring managers, et al. \u2013 is to be more humane\nand build sustainable relationships with candidates, thereby contributing to\nstrengthening the employer brand.\n\n**Data-based decision-making:** Being able to use available data analysis and\npatterns/trends is necessary to make sound hiring decisions.\n\n### **4\\. Skillset and capabilities of stakeholders**\n\n  \nPeople propel organizations. Keeping that context in mind, let\u2019s look at the\nskills and capabilities within an organization that can help improve\nrecruitment systems:\n\n**Design thinking:** As technology percolates into the recruitment system,\nemployees need to adopt iterative design thinking methods to arrive at the\nright solution that works smarter and faster.\n\n**Predictive analytics and decision sciences:** This is arguably one of the\nmost used skills by today\u2019s smart recruiters. From understanding big data to\nderiving trends to predicting job successes to building models of decision\nmaking \u2013 **[predictive analysis](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/hr-\nanalytics/5-hr-essentials-that-predictive-analytics-will-transform-\ncompletely/)** is key to a smarter recruitment approach.\n\n**Business acumen and understanding:** With recruitment becoming smarter, the\nrecruitment team needs to step into the role of a business partner. They need\nto understand business as well as recruitment. Raising the strategic status of\nsmart recruitment involves better business alignment.\n\n**Problem-solving and influencing skills:** Talent acquisition teams need to\nsolve strategic business challenges with skill and tact, keeping in mind the\ncontext of our dynamic environment and the quickly evolving relationship we\nhave with technology.\n\n**Change management:** Being able to influence critical business stakeholders\nto accept and work towards organization-wide adoption of fast-evolving changes\nis essential for more effective business evolution.\n\n**Consultative selling skills:** Recruiters need to be high-tech, modern-day\nmarketers and effective salespersons. They need to make candidates feel\ncomfortable while effectively selling the company culture and personalizing\ntheir outreach to serve immediate as well as future needs.\n\n**Learn More[How to Succeed with AI in\nRecruiting](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-\ntransformation/how-to-succeed-with-ai-in-recruiting/)**\n\n## **Becoming a Smart Recruiter**\n\nThe ability to **[avoid recruiting\npitfalls](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/top-7-tips-on-avoiding-common-recruitment-pitfalls/)** requires the\nsmart recruiter of 2020 to work in collaboration with the latest technology.\nThe smart recruiter needs to be a change leader and make the shift from\nmanual-mechanical recruitment practices toward smart-predictive recruitment\nstrategies keeping business goals and objectives in mind.\n\nBeing a smart recruiter is about continually evolving, maintaining the passion\nto find the most effective person-organization fit, and coming up with new\nbest practices to ensure recruiting success.\n\n**_What recruitment strategies do you use and why?

quit their jobs\n\nPublished Wed, Apr 3 201911:40 AM EDTUpdated Wed, Apr 3 20198:51 PM EDT\n\n[Eric\nRosenbaum](https://www.cnbc.com/id/100846695)[@erprose](https://twitter.com/erprose)\n\nKey Points\n\n  * IBM artificial intelligence can predict which employees will leave a job with 95 percent accuracy.\n  * IBM CEO Ginni Rometty says methods used in the traditional human resources model are failing American workers and need assistance from machine learning.\n  * AI, which has replaced 30 percent of IBM's HR staff, can help employees identify new skills training, education, job promotions and raises.\n\nVIDEO2:2202:22\n\nGinni Rometty on the future of work\n\n[At Work](https://www.cnbc.com/work/)\n\nIBM receives more than 8,000 resumes a day, making it No. 1 on job-search site\nGlassdoor for Gen Z applicants, said IBM CEO Ginni Rometty at CNBC's [**@**\nWork Talent + HR Summit](https://www.cnbcevents.com/work-talent-hr/) on\nTuesday in New York City.\n\nBut that's not the only way the technology giant, which employs roughly\n350,000 workers, knows who in the workforce is currently searching for a new\nposition. IBM artificial intelligence technology is now 95 percent accurate in\npredicting workers who are planning to leave their jobs, said Rometty.\n\nDuring Rometty's seven-year tenure as CEO, [IBM](/quotes/?symbol=IBM) has been\nimproving its AI work devoted to the retention of its employees.\n\n\"The best time to get to an employee is before they go,\" she said.\n\nIBM HR has a patent for its \"predictive attrition program\" which was developed\nwith Watson to predict employee flight risk and prescribe actions for managers\nto engage employees. Rometty would not explain \"the secret sauce\" that allowed\nthe AI to work so effectively in identifying workers about to jump\n(officially, IBM said the predictions are now in the 95 percent accuracy\n\"range\"). Rometty would only say that its success comes through analyzing many\ndata points.\n\n\"It took time to convince company management it was accurate,\" Rometty said,\nbut the AI has so far saved IBM nearly $300 million in retention costs, she\nclaimed.\n\nThe AI retention tool is part of a suite of IBM products that are designed to\nupend the traditional approach to human resources management. Rometty\ndescribed the classic human resources model as needing an overhaul, and said\nit is one of the professions where humans need AI to improve the work.\n\nRometty said that since IBM implemented technology more widely including cloud\nservices and other modernization, the tech giant has reduced the size of its\nglobal human resources department by 30 percent. But she added that the\nremaining positions are higher pay and able to perform higher-value work.\n\n\"You have to put AI through everything you do,\" she said.\n\n## A clearer career path is needed for many\n\nAmong the tasks that HR departments and corporate managers have not always\nproved effective at, and where AI will play a bigger role in the future, is\nkeeping employees on a clear career path and identifying their skills.\n\nRometty said being transparent with individual employees about their career\npath is an issue in which many companies still fail. And it is going to become\nmore critical. \"I expect [AI will change 100 percent of jobs in the next five\nto 10 years](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/02/ibm-ceo-ginni-romettys-solution-\nto-closing-the-skills-gap-in-america.html),\" the IBM CEO said.\n\nBeing transparent with employees means being honest about the skills that are\nneeded, especially when the workers don't possess them. IBM managers talk to\nemployees about market skills that are scarce or abundant.\n\n\"If you have a skill that is not needed for the future and is abundant in the\nmarket and does not fit a strategy my company needs, you are not in a good\nsquare to stay inside of,\" Rometty said. \"I really believe in being\ntransparent about where skills are.\"\n\nBy better understanding data patterns and adjacent skills, IBM AI can zero in\non an individual's strengths. In turn, this can enable a manager to direct an\nemployee to future opportunities they may not have seen using traditional\nmethods. \"We found manager surveys were not accurate,\" Rometty said, referring\nto formal skills assessments. \"Managers are subjective in ratings. We can\ninfer and be more accurate from data.\"\n\nIBM technology can view the tasks employees are completing, the educational\ncourses they have taken and any rankings they have earned. Through these data\npoints, the AI skills inference and HR managers can gain a greater\nunderstanding of an employee's skill set than they would by assessing the\nfeedback from manager surveys.\n\nIBM also abandoned another staple of classic HR: the annual performance\nreview, a move Rometty said she resisted at first, but persistent HR leaders\nproved to her was necessary. The company assesses employees on their skills\ngrowth as part of their quarterly feedback check-ins with management.\n\nYou have to know the individual. Skills are your renewable asset, and you need\nto treat them like that.\n\nGinni Rometty\n\nIBM CEO\n\nAI is getting better at providing career feedback to employees. IBM's MYCA (My\nCareer Advisor) AI virtual assistant uses Watson to help employees identify\nwhere they need to increase their skills. Its companion, Blue Match\ntechnology, serves up job openings to employees based on their AI-inferred\nskills data (employees opt into the service). Rometty said some of the 27\npercent of IBM workers who received a new job or promotion in 2018 were\nassisted by Blue Match.\n\n\"AI will change all jobs once it is in the workflow, and that is the most\nmeaningful kind of AI. Yes, some jobs will be replaced, but that is a red\nherring,\" Rometty contends. \"It is about getting people to work at the\nintersection of this.\"\n\nShe added: \"This is all a game about skill and having people with the right\nskills, and everyone's job is changing.\"\n\n## Getting rid of the current HR system\n\nTraditional human resource departments, where Rometty said companies typically\n\"underinvest,\" has been divided between a self-service system, where employees\nare forced to be their own career managers, and a defensive system to deal\nwith poor performers.\n\n\"We need to bring AI everywhere and get rid of the [existing] self-service\nsystem,\" Rometty said. IBM employees no longer need to decipher which programs\nwill help them upskill; its AI suggests to each employee what they should be\nlearning in order to get ahead in their career.\n\nPoor performers, meanwhile, will not be a \"problem\" that is dealt with only by\nmanagers, HR, legal and finance, but by solutions groups \u2014 IBM is using \"pop-\nup\" solutions centers to assist managers in seeking better performance from\ntheir employees. She said many companies have relied on centers of excellence\n\u2014 specialized groups or collaborative entities created to focus on areas where\nthere is a knowledge or skills gap within an organization or community. \"We\nhave to move away from centers of excellence to solutions centers.\"\n\nIBM's bet is that the future of work is one in which a machine understands the\nindividual better than the HR individual can alone. To be clear, the IBM CEO's\ncomments were not framed as an attack on the HR profession. In fact, she began\nher remarks at the CNBC event by describing HR as a \"labor of love\" and adding\nshe was \"such a fan of this profession.\"\n\nBut the new era of AI-centered human resources will improve upon something\nmany human-led HR teams can't handle as effectively as a machine that can\ncrunch millions of data points and learn in new ways. Recognizing the true\nresource potential of individuals and serving as growth engines for companies.\n\n\"It is at the individual level. You have to know the individual. Skills are\nyour renewable asset, and you need to treat them like that,\" Rometty said.\n\n _Correction: An earlier version of this story said the AI employee retention\ntool is only for internal use. IBM later clarified that it is being offered to\nexternal clients._\n\nRelated Tags\n\n  * [International Business Machines Corp](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes?symbol=IBM)\n  * [Workplace

Technology governs our work as well and demands that we stay\nready to adapt with agility and intelligence. With so much around us in a\nstate of constant flux, Human Capital Management (HCM) warrants a deeper\nunderstanding.\n\n## **1\\. What is Human Capital Management?**\n\nHuman Capital Management (HCM) is defined as a set of practices for human\nresource management, with the goal of achieving organizational competency for\nworkforce acquisition, management and optimization.\n\nBefore we delve deeper into HCM processes, features and strategies, let\u2019s take\na moment to focus on the key elements of the definition.\n\n**First** , HCM is not mere theories and rules \u2013 but rather a \u201cset of\npractices\u201d. The practical aspect of HCM is important because it points to the\nfact that in order to be practical, these systems need to stay relevant.\n\n**Second** , HCM is \u201cfocused on the organizational need\u201d. What might be\nperfect for organization A might be a completely wrong fit for organization B.\nThe point to be noted here is that while we are often bombarded with best\npractices for doing everything, the best practice to start with is often to\nstep away from the herd and find the best fit.\n\n**Third** , under the HCM canopy, we need to find the right competencies to\nfocus on with regard to \u201cworkforce acquisition, workforce management, and\nworkforce optimization\u201d. While the use of \u201cworkforce\u201d may seem a little dated\nin today\u2019s WoW (World of Work) of \u201ctalent\u201d speak, the definition does capture\nthe essence of HCM. Having said that, the practices under HCM need to evolve\nto keep pace with our growing relationship with technology.\n\nToday there are multiple HCM suite solutions available in the market. For\nexample, multi-feature, comprehensive suite offerings by Workday, SAP, Oracle,\nPeopleSoft, BambooHR, Zoho People and many other players offer such a wide\nvariety of solutions that it leads to a decision dilemma in assessing what\nwould really work for a particular organization.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is HRIS? System, Model and\nApplication**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-hris/)\n\n## **2\\. The 3 core aspects of Human Capital Management (HCM)**\n\nHuman Capital Management covers a wide spectrum of talent acquisition and\nmanagement processes throughout the employee life cycle. To understand better,\nlet\u2019s divide the whole spectrum into three broad functionalities \u2013 **(A)\nTalent Acquisition (TA), (B) Talent Management and (C) Talent Optimization** \u2013\nand deep dive into the nuances within each of these categories.\n\n### **Talent Acquisition**\n\n  \nIt\u2019s always best to start at the beginning - where the employee life cycle\ncommences. To be precise though, it actually starts just before the TA\nprocesses with Talent Gap Analysis. Predictive workforce planning tools like\nSAP HR Analytics and Oracle HCM Cloud take into consideration the current\ntalent spread, the immediate talent requirements and business strategies to\nmap future requirements based on a holistic analysis.\n\nA comprehensive TA-centric Human Capital Management system needs to cater to\nthe needs of the primary TA process:\n\n  1. **[Recruitment/ eRecruitment](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-recruitment/) \\- **This includes sourcing, screening, qualifying, and skill-matching\n  2. [**ATS (Application Tracking System)**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/top-applicant-tracking-systems/)\n  3. **[Onboarding](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-onboarding/what-is-new-employee-onboarding/) \\- **background checks, joining formalities, orientation, and a 30-60-90 day growth plan to get the new recruit started.\n\n  \nSolutions like SuccessFactors, SilkRoad Life Suite, Taleo (Oracle talent\ncloud), ClearCompany HRM and TribeHR offer tools that focus on gaining access\nto and acquiring the right talent. Finding the right match in today\u2019s\nimpatient and volatile environment is as difficult as it is necessary. An\nefficient ATS, for example, not only makes the job of the smart recruiter\neasier, but also improves the candidate experience. Recruitment being the\nfirst engagement between an organization and a prospective employee, it\nmatters how well the system is managed.\n\nWhile smart recruitment algorithms and recruiting chatbots have made the\ninitial stages of sourcing and screening a lot easier, a comprehensive end-to-\nend TA HCM solution needs to deliver more than that. It needs to be able to\nhelp the TA manager with the processes of qualifying r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, scheduling\ninterviews and skillset-matching while helping to collect and store data for\nbackground checks, carry out joining processes and also helping chart out a\ngrowth plan for the first three months for the new joinee. A 30-60-90day plan\nnot only lends more credibility to the need for a particular talent bust also\nprovides the newbie with a business-goals-centric plan to get started during\nthe first three crucial months.\n\nHuman Capital Management suites can also make the first day at work a lot\nsmoother and a lot less daunting with conversational bots to guide the way and\nhelp in a preliminary orientation to software, processes and organizational\ncharts.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What Is Talent Acquisition? Definition, Process,\nStrategies, and Best\nPractices**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/recruitment-\nonboarding/what-is-talent-acquisition/)\n\n### **Talent Management**\n\n  \nThe nature of talent that present-day organizations have to manage has changed\nmore in the last decade than it had changed over the 30 years before that.\nWork is no longer a place but a function with teams dispersed across\ncontinents, freelancers pitching in and increasingly flexible work-hours.\nHuman Capital Management systems need to be aware of and conscious about these\nnew tweaks to the work ecosystem. Keeping that in mind, here are the must-have\nfeatures for a talent management HCM system:\n\n**1.** **Time and attendance**\n\n  * Leaves and Absence management\n  * Self-service application and tracking systems\n  * Biometrics and security\n\n  \nWith an increase in remote workers, freelancers and globally dispersed teams,\nmapping time and attendance while also maintaining security needs is crucial.\nTools like TimeAttend and CeiPal Workforce make it easier to track and manage\non-the-job timings, leave applications and security requirements. Moreover,\nHCM tools enable self-service by allowing employees to manage their data\nthemselves thus creating greater transparency and improved engagement.\n\n**2.** **Payroll**\n\n  * Compensation mapping\n  * Remuneration tracking and roll-out\n  * Compensation planning for gig workers\n\n  \nWhile the focus has been growing on the non-monetary aspects at work,\ncompensation and benefits would always remain a key motivator. No matter how\nhard we try to eliminate the transactional nature of jobs, at the end of the\nday, while the paycheck is not the only thing that matters, it surely matters\na lot. Using Human Capital Management tools to manage payroll has been in\npractice for quite a few years now since it is one of the easier things to\nautomate. AI-enabled payroll HCM like Zenefits and RUN help in mapping\nindustry trends to benchmark compensation plans for the different sets of\nworkers from full-time on-location to remote gig-workers.\n\n**3.** **Performance management**\n\n  * Goal-alignment\n  * Task-tracking\n  * Internal communication and team planning\n\nHCM systems encourage and enable better communication. These mechanisms allow\nanytime-anywhere access, help in planning goals, aligning individuals and\nteams on the relevant business objectives and also allow 360 degree task-\ntracking. With tools like Performly, AssessTEAM, PerformancePro and BirdDogHR,\norganizations can boost productivity in ways that are more congenial to\nemployees.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Performance\nManagement?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/what-is-performance-management/)\n\n**4.** **Culture connect**\n\n  * Rewards and recognition\n  * Grievance addressal and redressal systems\n  * Weaving ethics into the system\n\n  \nWhat employees do at work everyday makes up the culture of the organization.\nWith tools like Globoforce and TinyPulse, organizations can build a branded\nculture of ethical behavior, recognition, gratitude and engagement. Moreover,\nwith Human Capital Management software, the culture can be translated to every\nemployee in all the functions that they serve and all the processes that they\nare a part of.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is Talent Management? Definition, Strategy, Process\nand Model**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/strategy/what-is-talent-\nmanagement/)\n\n### **Talent Optimization**\n\n  \nThe journey does not end with finding the right talent \u2013 it begins from there.\nIn that journey there can be no room for stagnation. Organizations need to\nconstantly try to create avenues for talent optimization \u2013 for individual and\ncollective growth, without turning on business goals and objectives. You need\nto future-proof your employees. Here are four ways in which the right HCM can\nenable that:\n\n  1. Career-pathing\n  2. Competency mapping\n  3. Succession planning\n  4. Learning and development\n\nWith a tailored HCM solution, organizations can not only train their employees\non immediate skill needs but also for the skill requirements of the future.\nCoursera, for example enables skills benchmarking with the use of AI\n(Artificial Intelligence). With efficient cloud-backed, data-driven HCM\nsystems, organizational leaders can make the right career-pathing decisions in\nadvance thus providing both the organization and the individual a map to\nfollow. Succession planning has been proven to a great way to optimize HiPos\nand the right HCM tools can help in decisions regarding the same by studying\ngallons of data. Tools like SuccessFactors HCM by SAP encourage diverse teams\nto collaborate better and optimize on the positives of having a team of very\ndifferent individuals.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **What is People Management?

The Right HCM Solution: Finding the \u201cSuite\u201d Spot**\n\nLike we stated in the beginning, when it comes to choosing an HCM suite, best-\nfit matters more than best practices.\n\nHere are some key considerations and questions when choosing the right HCM\nsolution\n\n### **1.** **Why do we need an HCM system?**\n\n  \nYou need to know what are the areas that need greater intervention, what are\nthe reasons that some processes have been difficult or stalled and what you\nwish you achieve with the investment in a new tool-system.\n\n### **2.** **What are the must-have and nice-to-have features we want?**\n\n  \nThe MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have this time) priority\nlist is a great start for any decision. You need to be able to answer what the\nHCM solution must do, should do, could do and also what it would do in the\nfuture.\n\n### **3.** **Present budget v/s growth needs?**\n\n  \nTo answer this, you might first have to identify where in the spectrum you\nfall. Are you an SMB (small and medium business) with less than 1000\nemployees, an MM (mid-market) player with an employee strength between\n1000-5000, an enterprise with over 5000 employees, a well-established MNC with\nover 10000 employees or are you a cusp organization transitioning between\nthese segregations? Based on where you fall in the spectrum and where you are\nheaded, you need to choose a solution that caters to your immediate needs but\nthat is also dynamic enough to incorporate your future needs. Your budget\nwould differ accordingly.\n\n### **4.** **What is the level of customization you require?**\n\n  \nThere are multiple HCM suite players in the market today that offer need-based\nplans. Most basic plans do not allow for customization but you need to be\nclear about what customizations you would need.\n\n### **5.** **Are you ready to adapt?**\n\n  \nBefore you build your case for investing in a new or upgraded HCM solution,\nask yourself whether your organization is ready for the change. There is often\nthe need for training with the introduction of any new tool and employees need\nto be allowed some teething time as well. The organization must be willing and\ncapable of letting employees and HR adapt to the change.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **HRIS vs. HCM: What's the\nDifference?**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/hris-vs-hcm-whats-the-difference/)\n\n## **The 5 Big HCM Trends for 2020**\n\nHere\u2019s a glimpse into the future and the five key trends that would shape up\nthe HCM space in the years to come:\n\n### **1\\. An end to worries about job-stealing-AI**\n\n  \nContrary to the \u201cAI Apocalypse\u201d narrative, recent studies point out that 93%\nof people are willing to take orders from a robot and 70% of employees are\nalready using some form of AI in their personal lives. By 2020, with this\nmentality seeping into work culture, employees would become a lot less fearful\nand a lot more adaptive to AI.\n\nThis would lead to greater, more effective human-AI collaboration in the\nsuper-job era, and better rationalization of high-value jobs and roles for\nhumans. It also means that HCM systems need to be set up to manage all kinds\nof \u2018employees\u2019 - human and non-human.\n\n### **2\\. AI will no longer be optional**\n\nAccording to a recent study by Oracle, 79% of HR leaders believe that failure\nto adopt AI will have a negative impact on their overall organization;\nhowever, only 6% of HR professionals are actively deploying AI solutions.\nRealizing this discrepancy will push more companies than ever \u2013 including\nthose that have traditionally been hesitant \u2013 to embrace artificially\nintelligent solutions.\n\nWhile more involvement and encouragement from the HR to create an AI-enabled\nwork culture would be ideal, the fact is that many HR teams are still\nstruggling with basic digital transformation and automation challenges. A\nstep-change approach is needed to ensure the drastic transformation - and your\nsystems need to be able to support this transformation with agility and scale.\n\n### **3\\. HR to lead the predictive analytics movement**\n\n  \nWhile many think of HR as a \u201csoft\u201d skill, the future of this industry is built\non the use of predictive analytics to make intelligent employee decisions. A\nrecent survey by HBR shows that 31% of HR professionals are already using AI-\nbacked data analysis to identify at-risk talent, source best-fit candidates\nvia resume analysis, and predict high-performing recruits. In 2020, I expect\nthis number to jump much higher.\n\nSmarter decisions backed by data and powered by predictive tools are on the\ncards, but what new skills do HR leaders need on their teams to ensure they\ncan make the most of these smart decision-making tools? What new workflows\nneed to be defined, designed and automated to ensure these smarter methods of\ntalent acquisition and employee retention are executed flawlessly\n\n### **4\\. Digital assistants will become \u201cco-workers\u201d**\n\n  \nDigital assistants, accessible through voice or SMS, work 24/7 and can provide\nnearly-instant, tailored responses on simple tasks like vacation balance and\nexpense approval to complicated subjects like taxes and benefits. Over time,\nthe digital assistants can even take on more sophisticated personas such as\nmentors, coaches or counselors.\n\nThe need to understand generational diversity at work better and in ways that\nare more actionable will be strategic to organizational success. Smart HCM\nSystems will create a seamless employee experience for everything from\nefficient and effective employee onboarding; day-to-day time-consuming tasks\nlike expense reporting; and career-defining initiatives such as coaching with\nreal-time, always-on systems that employees can access at their convenience\n\n### **5\\. Smarter, mobile recruitment**\n\n  \nWith the human attention span averaging just 8 seconds and the unemployment\nrate at its lowest in 50 years, applying for jobs needs to be easy and able to\nbe done on-the-go. Moving into 2020 and beyond, HR professionals will be\nforced to adapt their recruiting techniques to this new norm or risk losing\nquality talent to competitors.\n\nOrganizations need to create their employer brand based on candidate\nexpectations, technology trends, and the changing business environment. The\n\u2018last mile\u2019 between the job opportunity ad the potential candidate is a\ncrucial and vulnerable link - using technology to close that gap at the last\nmile with speed, accuracy and as per process is going to be central.\n\n**Learn More:**[ **Top 5 Human Capital Management (HCM) Software Features for\n2019**](https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/performance-management-\nhcm/top-hcm-software-features/)\n\n## **Handle Change Meaningfully**\n\nIn conclusion, what needs to be kept in mind is that the right HCM solution\ncan prove to be a lot more than a system that simply manages data and\nprocesses better. It can be a tool to motivate your employees, to engage them\norganically and to provide an augmented employee experience through the\nduration of their employment or even career. That said, how well a Human\nCapital Management system functions within an organization depends on how well\nyou use it and how motivated your employees feel to adapt to the upgrade. In\nthe end, it\u2019s all about how you, the HR manager can HCM - handle change\nmeaningfully!\n\n**_Are you happy with the HCM system you use?

This $1.3+ billion deal is important to note and brings its own special characteristics. \n\n__\n\n![Image of cornerstone\nlogo](/sites/default/files/styles/article_images_desktop/public/images/2020-02/15D5A16B-9BB5-437C-9900-2BB7F1FA4AA1.jpeg?itok=RGduqhHP)\n\nLate last week, Ultimate Software and Kronos announced a merger. This week,\nit\u2019s Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD) and Saba. Before we do the deal review,\nhere\u2019s a prophetic point I made in [last week\u2019s\npiece](https://diginomica.com/ultimate-kronos-merger-marriage-equals):\n\n> I can see why the deal is happening and it augers a new era/wave of\n> consolidation and maturity in cloud HR solutions. I understand the financial\n> underpinnings and synergies for the deal, too.\n\nThat was true for last week\u2019s deal and I believe it will be so for this one,\ntoo. Consolidation definitely is underway in the HCM tech space.\n\n## The deal details\n\nHere\u2019s the quick CSOD/Saba deal review:\n\n  * CSOD will pay $1.395 (USD) billion for Saba\n  * The vast majority of that amount will be financed via CSOD\u2019s cash on hand and short-term debt\n  * Combined, the company should have over 7,000 customers, 75 million users and $818 million in ARR\n  * Both parties will bring a number of large enterprise and mid-market company logos to the deal\n  * Combined, the two companies will deliver approximately $838 million in revenues. Today, it appears CSOD will contribute $577 (i.e., total 2019 revenue) million and Saba would contribute approx. $243 million.\n  * Adam Miller, CEO of CSOD will be CEO of the combined firm. Phil Saunders, CEO of Saba, will become Chief Operating Officer of the combined firm.\n\n## Planned merger benefits\n\nThe new company will go for many of the same synergy benefits that most\nacquirers seek. They\u2019ll pursue economies of scale in back office functions,\ndata center operations, etc.\n\n![Image of Cornerstone OnDemand Saba\nslide](/sites/default/files/styles/article_images_full_desktop/public/images/2020-02/11FBF385-A24B-4AEE-8DC8-5D170FF4A265.jpeg?itok=aeQienmx)\n\nWhat the slide above doesn\u2019t show are expansion opportunities for the combined\nfirms. We should expect CSOD to cross-sell Saba solutions into its own\ncustomer base and vice versa. Those sales should occur with substantially less\nsales and marketing expense compared to net-new deals. Those infill/cross-sell\ndeals should help grow margins and aid in rule of 40 target compliance.\n\nCEO Adam Miller told analysts he expects to better leverage the combined\nfirms\u2019 global R&D efforts. He also expects other deal dynamics including:\n\n  * More focused development around Talent Management and Talent Experience\n  * More sales successes with global marquee customers\n\n## The big goal\n\nCEO Miller wants to grow CSOD into \u2018one of the most successful cloud companies\nin the world\u2019. Doing so will take some work.\n\n**First, there are competitors.** CSOD, post-deal, will be a sub-billion-\ndollar (revenue) firm for at least another year or two. It will face larger HR\ntechnology competitors in the $3 billion revenue range. Those vendors include\nWorkday and the newly combined Ultimate/Kronos firm. Even larger competitors,\nlike SAP and Oracle, may eye a larger CSOD more warily. CSOD has maintained a\npeaceful relationship with Workday and other payroll providers for much of its\nexistence. How friendly those providers will be now remains to be seen as the\nnew CSOD will have much broader HCM/HR software footprint and will become a\nmore material global solutions provider, too.\n\n**Second, there are all of those different products, product architectures and\ndata models.** Saba bought Lumesse in 2018, Halogen in 2017 and Human Concepts\nlong before that. CSOD is no stranger to acquisitions either. They acquired\nSonar6 (a personal favorite of mine back then) about 8 years ago. Six years\nago, they acquired Evolv and two years ago, they acquired Workpop and Grovo.\nThe Saba acquisition is, in my estimation, considerably larger than any of\nthese. CEO Miller indicated that Saba was into well into the integration of\nLumesse and that prior acquisition integrations are done. CSOD has, I believe,\nintegrated all of its prior acquisitions. But, integration doesn\u2019t always mean\nthat all products are on the same architecture and share a common data model.\n\nThis will be an important matter as CSOD/Saba will be competing with firms\nlike Workday and Ceridian. Workday makes its single architecture and\narchitectural purity a key selling point (i.e., The Power of One). Ceridian\u2019s\nDayforce products have a similar singular architecture. A collection of\nacquired, but integrated, products generally will not fare as well in a\ncompetitive deal (all other things being equal). CSOD/Saba will nonetheless be\na force to contend with in deals where robust learning, learning content, etc.\nis a key deal driver.\n\n**Third, what happens to CSOD\u2019s partnerships?** For much of its existence,\nCSOD tried to be the Switzerland of software. It stayed neutral. When CSOD was\nmostly a learning solution firm, big HR suite and ERP competitors wanted to\npartner with them. CSOD had learning tech to offer and the competitors had\npayroll & HCM capabilities. Even after CSOD created a fairly complete HCM\nsuite, it still lacked a payroll module and maintained many of those same\npartnerships.\n\nBut CSOD has been growing and will get close to the $1 billion revenue mark\nbefore long. As a bigger firm, with more functionality and global coverage,\ncompetitors may be less inclined to partner with them. It will be interesting\nto see how Adam and the gang manage this.\n\nOn the other end are the partnerships with integrators, resellers, content\nproviders, technology partners, etc. that both firms possess that could become\nreal assets. These relationships can enhance functionality, extend\ncapabilities, make vertical extensions possible, introduce CSOD/Saba into new\naccounts, etc.\n\n## The deal brings additional global opportunities\n\nThe Lumesse part of Saba had a fair bit of EU customers. Saba itself had a lot\nof global accounts, too. CSOD has been implemented in much of the world. Added\ntogether, the new company should be able to better leverage its sales offices,\ndevelopment centers, data centers, etc. in an even more global and productive\nmanner.\n\nThis could be a real positive as more and more companies want a truly global\nsolution. They\u2019re so not interested in solutions that only work in U.S.\nEnglish for companies that are headquartered in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and\nAustralia. Global is so much more than multi-national and it\u2019s what businesses\nwant today.\n\n## Deal trivia\n\n  1. Vector Capital originally got involved with Saba back in 2013 but the relationship deepened in 2015 when Saba was taken private. Now, five years later, Vector may get its liquidity event.\n  2. After Phil Saunders took the helm at Saba, I told him that the culture and customer service ethos of Halogen was a major asset. A year later, he confessed that it was. I hope CSOD can find a way to incorporate some of that post-merger.\n\n## My take\n\nCompared to last week\u2019s Kronos/Ultimate deal, this one\u2019s way more digestible.\nWhile I wrote about all manner of post-merger integration issues in [last\nweek\u2019s piece](https://diginomica.com/ultimate-kronos-merger-marriage-equals),\nmany of the same concerns will apply here, too, although the degree of\ndifficulty may be less.\n\nCSOD/Saba customers will want to watch for announcements from the company over\nthe next few weeks and months. I\u2019d expect we\u2019ll hear a lot about product\nroadmaps, product support plans, etc. at Cornerstone\u2019s user conference in a\ncouple of months.\n\nIt\u2019s now fairly safe to say that the era of micro- or mini-HCM suites is\ncoming to an end. Buyers want a single vendor solution, wherever possible, and\nold functional moats are going away. CSOD/Saba is way bigger than before \u2013 now\nit must create a seamless, one UX, one data model, etc. solution to sell.\n\nIs more consolidation in the offing? Well, Ceridian looks like a good target\nfor someone to snap up. And Google or Microsoft (who already owns LinkedIn)\ncould be the next big acquirers in the space. But, in the short-term, I\nsuspect we\u2019ll see a lot more tuck-in deals not large acquisitions.\n\nThis deal will likely trigger additional FUD commentary from Cornerstone\u2019s\ncompetitors \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to hear the spinning that\u2019s to come.\n\nFor more information on Saba and Cornerstone OnDemand see:\n\n  * [Cornerstone unveils

Masterclass\nSeries](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-resilience-and-\nwellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\n**27th March** Strengthening the mental resilience and wellbeing of employees\n-  \nimproving employee engagement, talent retention and organisational\nproductivity.  \n[Register now here](https://www.hr.masterclasses.asia/strengthening-mental-\nresilience-and-wellbeing-of-\nemployees/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020)\n\nSingapore's Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Singapore National Employers\nFederation (SNEF) jointly released a [Job Sharing Implementation Guide last\nweek](https://snef.org.sg/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/05/Snef_Job_Sharing_Implementation_Guide_2019-1.pdf). The\nguide details the benefits of job sharing, how to implement it, a sample\npolicy for HR and employers to use, and more.\n\n_Human Resources_ highlights the key points to note, below:\n\n### What is job sharing and its benefits?\n\nJob sharing takes place as a flexible work arrangement (FWA), which allows to\nor more employees to share responsibilities of one full-time job, either\ndivided by function, geography, time or workload.\n\nIt requires employees involved in the arrangement to prepare properly detailed\nhandovers for ease of handling the tasks. Further, it differs from part-time\njobs, which are \"self-contained jobs with less than 35 hours of work per\nweek.\"\n\nAs showcased in the guide, job sharing can take the following forms:\n\n  * One employee shares part of the workload with a new hire;\n  * Two employees each split part of their workload with the new hire; or\n  * A few employees share a part of their workload with existing employees.\n\nWhy is job sharing useful? According to sources cited in the guide, it reduces\nvoluntary turnover by 20%, improves talent attraction, staff morale and\nsuccession management, and reduces absenteeism. Further, it increases employee\nproductivity by up to 30%, while saving costs from hiring by up to 20%.\n\n### How do HR and employers prepare for job sharing?\n\n1\\. First and foremost, the guide states that HR and employers **should\nidentify a list of jobs** in the organisation which can be shared by function,\ngeography, time or task.\n\n2\\. The **job categories that are possibly suitable for job sharing** include:\nHR, legal, information technology, finance, research and development, sales\nand marketing, and communication.\n\n3\\. It is important to understand the aims, responsibilities and outcomes of\nthe job by **engaging with the relevant stakeholders** before making a\ndecision. Here, the job arrangements, benefits, workload and the FWA policy\nshould be communicated to them, and an addendum about the job sharing issued\nto employees as well for clarity.\n\n4\\. Next, **the necessary changes to current work arrangements** should be\nmade in order to integrate the job sharing process as needed.\n\n5\\. Lastly, **HR and employers should either arrange for existing, suitable\nemployees** who can take on the additional workload, or recruit new hires to\ndo so.\n\n### Once it's implemented, how do you sustain it?\n\nHR and employers can start by arranging regular check-in timeslots between the\nemployees involved in the job sharing process and their supervisors.\nAdditionally, set up direct communications whereby HR is able to ensure proper\nsupport is provided to employees involved.\n\nIt is also important to study issues that may arise, so proper preparations\ncan be made when urgent needs pop up. More importantly, do make it a point to\nregularly review the current job sharing arrangement in order to learn new\nways to make future job sharing more effective.\n\n_To help assess your readiness to implement job sharing, here 's a handy\nchecklist provided in the guide:_\n\n![Priya-May-2019-job-sharing-SNEF-MOM-guide-checklist-provided](https://s3-ap-\nsoutheast-1.amazonaws.com/images.humanresourcesonline.net/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/05/27112318/Priya-May-2019-job-sharing-SNEF-MOM-guide-\nchecklist-provided.jpg)\n\n_Refer to the[full guide](https://snef.org.sg/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2019/05/Snef_Job_Sharing_Implementation_Guide_2019-1.pdf) for\nfrequently asked questions, sample FWA policies, sample addendum to the\nemployment contract, and more._ __\n\n* * *\n\n_Photo /[123RF](https://123rf.com)_\n\n[HR Masterclass\nSeries](https://masterclasses.humanresourcesonline.net/?utm_source=bulletin&utm_medium=intextad&utm_campaign=HRmasterclass_2020):\nWe're going virtual!

yacht skipper to founder of a $500 million\nsoftware start-up\n\nPublished Mon, Jan 20 20207:02 PM EST\n\n[Ryan Browne](https://www.cnbc.com/ryan-\nbrowne/)[@Ryan_Browne_](https://twitter.com/@Ryan_Browne_)\n\nKey Points\n\n  * Hanno Renner, 29, was a yacht skipper while at college in Munich and began Personio with a group of three friends.\n  * The HR software firm just secured a $75 million funding round led by Accel, which values it at close to $500 million.\n  * Personio plans to use the money to expand to the U.K. and Ireland as well as ramp up hiring.\n\nHanno Renner, co-founder and CEO of Personio.\n\nPersonio\n\nHanno Renner was 25 when he set up Personio, a software start-up looking to\ntake the myriads of boring admin tasks and piles of paper out of human\nresources.\n\nBefore he became a tech entrepreneur, Renner was a student at Germany's\nTechnical University of Munich, where he had an unusual job to accompany his\ncollege studies.\n\n\"The only job I had next to my studies was being a skipper of sailing yachts,\"\nRenner, now 29, told CNBC in an interview. Renner's skipper gig took him\naround the world, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.\n\nBut he stresses he didn't drop out of college, a [familiar\ntale](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/10/10-ultra-successful-millionaire-and-\nbillionaire-college-dropouts.html) from the U.S. tech industry, where the\nlikes of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg left school before they\ncould collect their diplomas. Instead, he decided to complete his degrees and\nbegan Personio with a group of three friends from a joint institution run by\nMunich's two main universities.\n\nRenner says he found the inspiration to start Personio after one of his\nfriends, who at the time was chief technology officer of a company with 100\nemployees, was having trouble organizing recruitment and payroll processes\nwithout any dedicated software.\n\n\"They had a problem with having all their people's data in an Excel sheet,\"\nRenner says. While [Microsoft's](/quotes/?symbol=MSFT) spreadsheet software\ncan be a \"good\" way of organizing data, Renner said it wasn't enough to solve\nmany of the \"bread and butter processes\" involved in HR.\n\n\"What we really cover are the bread and butter things that every company\nneeds, but that are really hard to do with pen and paper and an Excel sheet,\"\nRenner said. \"As you can imagine with an onboarding process, there's a lot of\ninformation you have to get from an employee.\" Personio's platform offers a\nsuite of tools to help manage and automate everything from job application\ntracking to payroll accounting and employee feedback.\n\n## Aggressive growth\n\nOver four years since it was founded, Renner's company is now a near-$500\nmillion start-up, thanks to a fresh $75 million funding round led by U.S.\nventure capital firm Accel. With the latest investment, a Series-C round,\nPersonio has now raised over $129 million from its investors, which also\ninclude Lightspeed and Lars Dalgaard, the CEO of rival\n[SAP's](/quotes/?symbol=undefined) Success Factors.\n\nAnd Renner boasts his firm didn't even have to go out pitching investors for\nthe latest cash injection. \"We weren't planning to raise yet,\" he said, adding\nPersonio was instead approached by new and existing backers. He said the firm\nstill has about 50% of the money it raised from its latest round a year ago.\n\nEnterprise software firms have been hot acquisition targets of late, with\ncompanies like GitHub and Red Hat being snapped up by Microsoft and\n[IBM](/quotes/?symbol=IBM) respectively in recent years. Last year also saw a\n[huge number](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/22/datadog-is-fourth-software-ipo-\nin-2019-to-reach-10-billion-market-cap.html) of software companies list their\nshares on the public markets.\n\nSome of Personio's direct rivals include software upstarts Bob and CharlieHR,\nbut it's also up against competition from established enterprise tech giants\nlike [Salesforce](/quotes/?symbol=CRM), [Oracle](/quotes/?symbol=ORCL) and\nSAP. Renner said that Personio's unique selling point is that it specifically\ntargets small-to-medium sized businesses that employ between 10 and 2,000\nemployees.\n\nCompanies like SAP and Oracle \"will always be focused on the enterprise space,\nthe [BMWs](/quotes/?symbol=BMW-DE) of the world,\" said Renner. \"We are trying\nto help those companies that currently don't have solutions in the market\ntailored to their needs.\"\n\nWith another $75 million in the bank, Personio says it plans to use the money\nto expand to the U.K. and Ireland as well as ramp up hiring. It's already\ngrown to 350 employees in 2020 from 120 last year, Renner said, and is set to\nhave a global workforce of 700 people by the end of the year.\n\nRelated Tags\n\n  * [United
